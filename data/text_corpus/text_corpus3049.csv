15245,due to the widespread application of various iron fe derived substances used in phosphorus p removal during wastewater treatment fe p species generated in this process constitute an important part of p speciation in non digested sludge sem eds and sequential extraction methods were utilized to analyze the speciation distribution and spatial variation of p contained in the sludge inorganic p accounted for 91 3 of the total p and fe iii p represented the greatest percentage 68 5 in the inorganic p fraction ascorbic acid also known as vitamin c vc performed well in releasing p from sludge especially in combination with subsequent ph adjustment to 3 0 using hcl fe iii p in sludge was first reduced to fe ii p by vc then dissolved in acidic conditions to release fe2 and po4 3 other metal p compounds were also partially dissolved and released vc disrupted the sludge floc structure releasing organic p via organic efflux there was a positive correlation r2 0 97 p 0 05 between the amount of released p and the amount of reductant vc there was a synergistic effect between 120 mmol l vc and acidity producing the greatest p release of 67 1 of total sludge p the p release efficiency achieved in this study was higher than other reported methods additionally vc provides a more sustainable option due to its natural biodegradability released p and fe2 can be recovered as vivianite with recovery rates of 88 and 99 respectively this finding provides a new direction for effective sustainable sludge p recovery and utilization graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords

introduction phosphorus p is an important biological component of cell membrane phospholipids nucleic acids and the energy carrier adenosine triphosphate atp thus human activities consume large amounts of p which is mainly derived from p mining at present wilfert et al 2015 accounting for about 19 7 mt p year as the population increases and diet structure changes the demand for p ore is expected to increase ding et al 2022 vaccari et al 2019 and lead to a sharp decline in p ore resources and thus limited output moreover p is essentially discharged to water bodies after p ore extraction and is then combined with metal ions to sediment it disrupting the p cycle marin batista et al 2020 zhu et al 2022 therefore the recovery of p before its discharge into water bodies is important to restore this cycle which is of great significance for resource sustainability approximately 1 3 mt p per year is treated by wastewater treatment plants wwtps and is deposited in the sludge li and li 2017 van vuuren et al 2010 if this p can be effectively recovered p ore mining could be reduced by approximately 6 5 10 concurrently to meet increasingly stringent emission standards and alleviate eutrophication increasingly more wwtps are adopting chemical p removal as an alternative to traditional biological p removal such that inorganic p is now commonly the dominant form in sludge shi et al 2020 considering the attractive price of fe salts they are widely applied in wwtps in china as p removal agents fan et al 2018 and so fe p represents a huge proportion of the total inorganic p li et al 2018 typical p recovery methods require pretreatment to release p from the sludge to the liquid phase and then recover it as mineral precipitates a variety of pretreatment methods have been used to release p including anaerobic digestion ad ph adjustment chelator treatment resin exchange sulfide reduction free ammonia treatment and thermal pretreatment yu et al 2021 ding et al 2022 ping et al 2020 shi et al 2020 wilfert et al 2020 xu et al 2018 xu et al 2015 among them chelator treatment reduction and ph adjustment reportedly have good performance in releasing inorganic p from sludge the release of p by chelasnts achieved by preventing charged p species adsorption to sludge and therefore mainly affects metal p compounds in addition to the common chelator ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta zou et al 2017 there are environmentally friendly chelators tannic acid ta polyaspartic acid pasp and sodium gluconate sg chen et al 2022 however the degree of their chelating ability on metals varies and needs further exploration using ph adjustment studies have shown that copious inorganic p can be dissolved under acidic conditions in addition to aiding organic p release alkaline conditions could mobilize al p but exhibited a negative effect on ca p release chen et al 2019 xu et al 2015 however extremely acidic conditions ph 2 0 were required to break the interaction between metal p compounds monea et al 2020a monea et al 2020b which posed difficulties for subsequent sludge disposal such as dewatering lu et al 2022 therefore it is necessary to develop methods to enhance p release under milder conditions fe ii p is more unstable than fe iii p and can therefore be dissolved causing p release even under weakly acidic conditions dmitri 2012 previous studies adopted both bio reduction and chemical reduction to mobilize p wang et al 2020 lippens and de vrieze 2019 ad a common bio reduction system promoted inorganic p and fe release by dissimilatory iron reducing bacteria in addition to anaerobic organic p release from phosphate accumulating organisms paos wu et al 2020 unfortunately ad is time intensive and the digestive performance is variable resulting in inconsistent p release efficiency therefore chemical reduction is more attractive sulfide was used for fe iii reduction at a molar ratio of 1 0 fe s to mobilize p in sludge which not only reduced fe iii but also formed fesx and provided a p release efficiency of about 31 wilfert et al 2020 however the propensity of sulfide in sludge not only deteriorated the dewatering performance but also posed challenges for subsequent sludge disposal wilfert et al 2020 ascorbic acid commonly known as vitamin c vc is an inexpensive easily available and environmentally friendly single electron reducing agent that can circumvent the disadvantages of sulfide its ability to reduce fe iii to fe ii has been extensively studied in the medical field cameron and campbell 1974 moertel et al 1985 due to the improved solubility of fe ii salts under acidic conditions enhanced p release could in theory be achieved by further decreasing sludge ph after the treatment of vc reduction additionally not only p but also fe ca al mg and other metal ions would be released into the liquid phase during this type of pretreatment except sulfide reduction providing the additional possibility of recovering these metals for example the coexistence of po4 3 and fe2 in the solution allowed them to be recovered in the form of vivianite by adjusting ph prot et al 2020 however reports on the application of vc in reducing fe iii to improve p release from sludge are rare the aim of this study is to enhance p release from waste sludge by vc reduction and acid dissolution first the distribution of p speciation in raw sludge was investigated second both the p and fe2 release profile as well as the efficiency of p species transformation by vc reduction followed by acid dissolution was examined these results were compared against a variety of agents to understand the reaction mechanism behind this treatment third p and fe in the liquid were recovered in the form of vivianite 2 materials and methods 2 1 waste activated sludge waste activated sludge was was taken from the secondary sedimentation tank after gravity thickening in chongqing jiguanshi wwtp the plant adopted the anaerobic anoxic oxic process and added iron salt in the connection pipeline between aeration tank and sedimentation tank to assist p removal the obtained was was pre concentrated in a refrigerator at 4 c for 24 h after which decanted the supernatant from the settled was to yield a higher total solids ts and avoid p release induced by microbial activities main parameters of the pre concentrated was were as follows ts 31 5 g l volatile solid vs 13 4 2 1 g l ph 7 5 0 1 and po4 3 concentration was 0 014 0 001 mg l weight proportion of main elements contained in the pre concentrated was were summarized in table 1 and fe is the dominate metallic element followed by al the high al value is due to the use of al based coagulant in the high density flocculation tank of the wwtp 2 2 test for enhancing p release 2 2 1 role of different agents and ph experiments were performed in 50 ml centrifuge tubes two experimental groups including ph adjustment and vc addition with ph adjustment were built additionally p release profile by using different kinds of chelators addition was also presented to give a comparison each group consisted of 4 types of working conditions for the ph adjustment group the ph of the sludge was adjusted to 3 0 4 0 and 5 0 by using 2 0 m hcl and naoh named as ph3 ph4 ph5 the raw sludge without ph adjustment was set as control named as raw the group of vc addition with ph adjustment adding 30 mmol l vc to the sludge and then adjusting the sludge ph to 3 0 4 0 and 5 0 named as vc30 ph3 vc30 ph4 vc30 ph5 additionally the sample with only vc addition was prepared as control named as vc30 the chelator added group 30 mmol l edta was added and ta pasp and sg were added with the same amount named as edta ta pasp and sg the centrifuge tubes were shaken for 2 hours after adding of these chemicals under 25 c with the shaken speed of 200 rpm after finishing the reaction the supernatant was centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 10 min and filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane to analyze concentrations of po4 3 and soluble total p stp 2 2 2 effect of vc concentrations to optimize the vc dosage in p releasing from sludge experiments were also performed in two groups group a and b the ph of group b was adjusted to 3 0 while no adjustment was adopted in the group a different vc dosages 0 10 20 30 40 50 70 100 120 and 150 mmol l were adopted in both groups 2 3 explore the effect mechanism of vc and ph the sludge was divided into two equal portions one with 0 30 70 and 120 mmol l vc dosing typical concentrations in section 2 2 2 and the rests were treated by ph adjustment to 3 0 all were shaken and then centrifuged the supernatant was collected for analysis and the residue was lyophilized for subsequent p extraction and characterization the raw sludge and obtained samples were named as raw ph3 vc30 vc30 ph3 vc70 vc70 ph3 vc120 and vc120 ph3 based on the improved sedex method ruttenberg et al 2009 and sequential extraction of inorganic p kovar and pierzynski 2009 a new 7 step sequential extraction method of p from lyophilized sludge was proposed by combining with the optimized extraction process of fe ii p gu et al 2016 the extraction process is shown in fig s1 0 2 g of lyophilized sludge was precisely weighed for sequential extraction of p speciation the extracted p speciation contains loosely p mainly p physically adsorbed to metal oxides hydroxides and carbonates fe ii p which is unoxidized fe p al p mainly as aluminum phosphate and hydrated aluminum phosphate fe iii p which is trivalent iron phosphorus compounds reductant extracted p reductant p mainly precipitates or colloid encapsulated p formed by metal oxides ca p from authigenic formation and organic p from microbial cells 2 4 synthesis of vivianite extra k2hpo4 3h2o was added to the supernatant of vc70 ph3 to make the molar ratio of fe2 to po4 3 at about 1 5 the solution ph was adjusted to 7 0 gradually by using 1 m naoh under anaerobic condition to react for 1 h and then aged for 2 h the precipitates were washed and then dried under vacuum at 35 c for comparison standard reference sample was synthesized from 0 2 m of k2hpo4 3h2o and 0 3 m of feso4 7h2o solution at ph 7 to obtain pure vivianite crystals the recovery efficiency r and of fe2 and po4 3 are calculated using the following eq 1 respectively 1 r c o c t c o 100 where co represents the initial concentration of fe2 and po4 3 and ct represents concentration of the fe2 and po4 3 at the end of synthesis 2 5 analytical methods 2 5 1 general analysis soluble chemical oxygen demand scod ts vs fe2 po4 3 and stp were determined by apha standard methods apha 2005 soluble organic p is the difference between stp and po4 3 polysaccharide was estimated by anthrone sulfate method morris 1948 deoxyribonucleic acid dna was measured by the diphenylamine method gendimenico et al 1988 humic substances hs and protein were detected by the modified lowry method frolund et al 1995 ph was measured by ph analyzer fe28 metter toledo shanghai metal ions were measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes agilent 5110 usa after

spectrum analyzer xps thermo scientific k alpha usa morphology of microbial cells of the sludges was observed by biological scanning electron microscopy sem hitachi su8010 while the spatial distribution of p was estimated by energy dispersive spectroscopy eds hitachi su8010 japan the apoptotic change of microbial cells was estimated by co staining with annexin v fitc and propidium iodide pi fluorescent dyes and then the samples were measured by the ftic channel and precp channel of the flow cytometer bd accuritmc6 plus usa the physiological status of microorganism cells can be segmented into four regions live cells are shown in av pi q4 early apoptotic cells are shown in av pi q3 necrotic or late apoptotic cells are shown in av pi q2 and debris and damaged cells are shown

besides the morphology and particle size of the synthesized vivianite were analyzed by optical microscope and laser particle size analyzer lpsa 2 5 3 statistical analysis and data processing each test was performed in triplicate error bars stand for standard deviations of triplicate measurements analysis of variance was used to test the significance of the results and p 0 05 was regarded to represent a statistically significant difference a split peak fit for fe 2p was performed with the xps peak 41 program 3 results and discussion 3 1 distribution of p in raw sludge sludge in secondary sedimentation tanks is composed of both microbes and inorganic minerals to explore the distribution of p in these two components sem eds analysis was performed p was a major element on the surface of both the organismal and inorganic fractions of sludge comprising 7 25 and 10 27 of each weight respectively fig s2 b and c p on the organismal fraction surface is mainly in the form of teichoic acid formed by phosphodiester bonding zhang et al 2021 on the inorganic fraction surface p is mainly combined with fe al ca and mg to form inorganic p species such as fe p al p ca p and mg p fig s2 c which is in accordance with previous work li et al 2018 however eds can only qualitatively analyze the particle surface and cannot determine the binding state of metal ions with p to further investigate the specific distribution of p in raw sludge a seven step extraction method was adopted for the sequential determination of p speciation as shown in fig 1 fe iii p was the most abundant p species in the raw sludge accounting for 62 5 of the total sludge p followed by al p organic p and ca p at respective percentages of 20 7 8 7 and 3 1 this was consistent with a previous report on p distribution in sludge zhang et al 2019 in contrast for the sludge obtained from the wwtps with an enhanced biological p removal unit fe p accounted for only 24 and organic p reached 15 wang et al 2020 moreover loosely sorbed p loosely p in adsorbed form and unoxidized fe ii p are also present 2 3 additionally the p contained in the supernatant of the sludge was less than 0 01mg l indicating that most of the p was transferred to the precipitate after the combination of biological and fe salt treatment therefore the release of inorganic p especially fe p from this sludge type is of great significance for p recovery 3 2 selection of agent concentration and ph 3 2 1 effect of various agents and ph on p release from sludge the p release profile for different experimental groups is shown in fig 2 for the ph adjusted group the po4 3 was only present in the supernatant of the raw sludge at ph 5 0 to 3 0 and the maximum concentration released was 18 2 mg l at ph 3 0 this is due to the fact that the solubility of inorganic p correlates to solution ph with higher dissolution obtained at greater acidity for the 30 mmol l vc treatment the released amount of po4 3 without any ph adjustment reached 22 5 mg l this may be because vc reduced fe iii p in sludge to fe ii p and there was a partial release of p in the reduction process due to the variable molar ratio of fe to p eq 2 wang et al 2018 the release of po4 3 was further increased after adjusting ph the amount of released po4 3 at ph 5 0 4 0 and 3 0 was 33 4 124 3 and 194 8 mg l respectively vc supplementation promoted p release at all ph conditions and the most significant improvement due to vc was observed at ph 3 0 where released po4 3 was 10 6 times higher than with ph adjustment alone this result can be explained by the higher solubility of fe ⅱ compounds than fe ⅲ compounds under the same ph which is consistent with the variation of the morphology of different valence states of fe with ph in the pourbaix diagram dmitri 2012 the morphological changes of particular fe p speciation events during the reaction process are analyzed in detail in section 3 3 2 due to the propensity of p released in ph 3 0 this ph condition was also used for subsequent experiments 2 3 f e p o 4 3 e f e 3 p o 4 2 p o 4 3 p release using chelants is intensely studied because chelants can mobilize multivalent metal ions ping et al 2020 it has been reported that complexing agents not only leach p from sludge ash but can also enhance p release from anaerobic fermentation fang et al 2018 xu et al 2021 for comparison the p release with a variety of chelants is also shown in fig 2 all chelants in this study enhanced p release efficiencies among which edta presented the best performance resulting in 76 2 mg l po4 3 concentration in the supernatant furthermore the release of p is highly dependent on the type of chelants which agrees with a previous study ping et al 2020 comparing the three groups above illustrates the superiority of vc ph treatment in releasing p from sludge therefore further research was carried out to further optimize the vc ph group and elucidate the mechanism responsible for these improvements 3 2 2 optimization of vc dosage considering the hypothesis that vc reduces fe iii to fe ii and therefore the dosage of vc could be the key parameter in determining overall reduction efficiency additionally vc dosing impacts slurry ph because vc itself carries some hydrogen ions table s1 therefore there may be variable effectiveness among vc dosages on p release from sludge as shown in fig 3 a and b at increasing vc dosage the trend of p release and soluble fe2 sfe2 was a curve with initially slow then subsequently rapid increase before finally leveling off suggesting that vc indeed works on fe iii p impaired release of p at low vc dosage may be ascribed to the limited reduction capability under such conditions additionally it is also possible that at low vc dosages the slurry ph remained stable and therefore the dissolution of fe ii p was quite limited ph adjustment was investigated to further drive the release of p from the sludge shown in fig 3 a both p and sfe2 increased rapidly with a combination of vc treatment and acidic conditions ph 3 0 overall the p release in the combined vc supplementation and acidic treatment was significantly higher than the groups using vc or ph modification alone the 30 mmol l vc treatment produced the most pronounced effect resulting in about 4 8 times higher than the sum of using either ph or vc p release plateaued when the vc dosage exceeded 70 mmol l indicating that fe iii p was rapidly and continuously reduced to fe ii p at vc 70 mmol l and was dissolved after adjustment to ph 3 0 the concentration of sfe2 almost reached the theoretical maximum 1628 mg l with the addition of 70 mmol l of vc indicating that fe iii in the sludge had been almost completely reduced at the vc dosage of 120 mmol l the supernatant stp concentration was enhanced potentially due to cell lysis releasing organic p due to excessive vc concentration furthermore plotting released fe2 and po4 3 revealed a significant positive correlation p 0 05 r2 0 96 between fe2 and po4 3 in dosage of vc alone and in combination with acidity fig 3 c indicating that the reduction and dissolution of fe iii p determines the release of po4 3 into aqueous solution to verify this 30 70 and 120 mmol l of vc were selected for follow up experiments to further explore the mechanism of vc and ph on inorganic p especially fe p and organic p in cells 3 3 effect of vc and ph on the properties of p metals and sludge 3 3 1 p and metal ions in the supernatant ph adjustment not only affects the release of inorganic p by affecting the morphological transformation of metal p compounds xu et al 2015 but also induces organic p release by decomposing cells and organic matter zhang et al 2021 fig 4 a shows that the addition of vc introduces h that decreases the sludge s ph and that the ph values of these samples partially recovered after the reaction indicating that the reaction process consumes substantial amounts of h in addition the ph at the end of the reaction with vc30 at ph 3 0 later returns to 4 29 which is higher than the ph 4 03 achieved after the reaction of ph 3 0 alone verifying that the addition of vc promotes the utilization of h which can be explained as follows 1 fe iii is more stable than fe ii so h will act more easily on fe ii after the reduction of fe iii to fe ii 2 vc may complex metals thus physically loosening inorganic mineral structures or cells making it easier to contact h however as the concentration of vc was increased ph restoration diminished again this phenomenon probably occurs because vc70 and vc120 provided a considerable amount of h and then the reaction consumed less h after further adjusting the ph to 3 0 p and fe concentrations before and after treatment based on fig 3 are shown in fig 4 b and c at increasing vc concentration without ph adjustment both po4 3 and sfe2 concentrations increase reaching the maximum at 120 mmol l vc with their respective concentrations of 237 and 1516 mg l likely due to the effect of h delivered by vc itself for fepo4 and fe3 po4 2 as in eqs 3 and 4 after reducing fe iii moreover it is worth mentioning that there are synergistic effects between vc and h on the release of p and sfe2 after adjusting ph to 3 0 and this effect decreased with increasing vc concentration as mentioned in section 3 2 2 this situation can be explained by the nearly complete reduction of fe iii p to fe ii p followed by dissolution in vc70 ph3 in contrast the excess vc addition in vc120 ph3 only served to provide h for decreasing ph so the difference in sfe2 between the two was not as pronounced 1627 mg l and 1653 mg l respectively therefore though the corresponding po4 3 release in vc120 ph3 was the highest 292 mg l in the supernatant among the treatments it presented slightly higher than that in vc70 ph3 279 mg l in the supernatant 3 f e p o 4 3 h h 3 p o 4 f e 3 4 f e 3 p o 4 2 6 h 2 h 3 p o 4 3 f e 2 5 a l p o 4 3 h h 3 p o 4 a l 3 6 c a 3 p o 4 2 6 h 2 h 3 p o 4 3 c a 2 in addition the release of organic p difference between stp and po4 3 increased at greater vc concentration the maximum occurred at vc120 indicating that vc could indeed act on sludge microbiota this is consistent with previous reports that paos cells release poly p under low ph conditions to sustain homeostasis feng et al 2020 under acidic conditions some organic p will be hydrolyzed to po4 3 which explains why there is a decrease in organic p after ph adjustment fig 1 shows that in addition to fe p al p and ca p also account for a large amount of inorganic p in sludge under acidic conditions portions of these species may be dissolved and released into the liquid phase according to the reaction shown in eqs 3 6 fig 4 d shows that the concentration of al3 and mg2 in the supernatant followed the same trend as sfe2 but overall their concentration was much lower peak concentrations were 11 and 78 mg l at vc120 ph3 which indicates that ph changes also promote the release of al p and mg p but this effect was much smaller than that of fe moreover ca2 also increased with vc dosing ca2 concentration rose steeply by adjusting the ph to 3 0 while it dropped in vc30 ph3 and then increased with increasing vc fig 4 d it is presumed that a large amount of ca salts would be dissolved and released to the aqueous phase at ph 3 0 furthermore vc would complex some ca2 and the stability of the complex was positively correlated with ph therefore the maximum release of ca2 was still at vc120 ph3 which was 768 mg l the increased ca2 concentration in supernatant indicated promoted release of ca p 3 3 2 distribution of p speciation before and after sludge treatment to investigate which particular p speciation events contributed to p release sequential step by step p extraction was performed fig 5 the sum of p speciation extracted from each treatment was approximately 20 1 mg g ts which was consistent with the total p content shown in table 1 fe iii p content was inversely correlated with vc dosage 62 5 in raw sludge to only 9 0 in vc120 indicating that the fe iii p fraction was continuously reduced by vc an effect that was further intensified after ph adjustment to 3 0 therefore the depletion of fe iii p by vc was greatest in vc120 ph3 where the fe iii p fraction was further decreased to 3 4 the fraction of fe ii p yield showed the opposite trend increasing from 2 2 to 9 5 with the increase of vc dosage additionally there was a slight decrease 8 2 of fe ii p after ph adjustment revealing that some fe ii p was retained in the sludge at the end of the reaction instead of being released into the aqueous phase this mechanism will be discussed in detail in section 3 5 similar results were obtained from xps spectrogram analysis of the sludge s solid phase shown in fig s3 where the p 2p and fe 2p decreased gradually with increasing vc dosage and acidity the results of the fine spectrum of fe 2p were also analyzed and are presented in fig 6 as well as the area percentage of peaks in table 3 these figures show two main peaks near 710 6 ev fe 2p 3 2 and 724 7 ev fe 2p 1 2 which were observed for all samples lv et al 2015 for raw sludge and ph adjusted samples without vc supplementation the fe 2p 3 2 peak decomposed into two peaks at 711 4 ev and 715 4 ev implying the presence of an fe3 valence state for iron and satellite peaks liu et al 2016 omran et al 2015 the peak at fe 2p 1 2 was decomposed into two peaks of 725 0 ev and 730 0 ev which were also the fe3 peak and the satellite peak respectively with vc addition new peaks of 709 6 ev and 723 3 ev appeared at the positions of fe 2p 3 2 and fe 2p 1 2 which represented the fe2 chemical state bae et al 2018 shaw et al 2017 furthermore with increasing vc dose the peak area of fe3 state lowered proportionally and the peak area of the fe2 state proportionally increased from 4 3 in vc30 to 12 3 in vc70 and further to 15 5 in vc120 after ph adjustment the percentage of the peak area of fe2 increased further reaching its maximum at vc120 ph3 21 1 fig 5 shows that the fractions of ca p and al p decreased continuously with increasing vc dosage acidity further decreased their abundance in the sludge which agreed with the concentration of metal ions in the supernatant shown in fig 4 d this phenomenon may have been due to the ability of vc to complex metals ritacca et al 2022 and the fact that the h lowered the solution ph leading to ready dissolution of ca p and al p although organic p release in the solid phase with vc and ph treatment was consistent with that of the metal p compounds the combined amount of organic p in the solid and liquid phases was not constant these discrepancies in the combined p amount indicated that part of organic p was hydrolyzed under acidic conditions specifically acid stress can easily disrupt the phospholipid bilayer of microbial cell membranes containing functional proteins leading to the denaturation of functional proteins lund et al 2014 thus provoking the release of protein residues and lipid phosphorus intensifying the acidity can also break the basic group in organic p which leads to hydrolysis of lipids nucleic acids and proteins producing po4 3 organic matter pentose and peptides hirota et al 2010 the percentage of stp in raw sludge was almost zero but increased slightly to 3 after adjusting the sludge s ph to 3 0 stp rose steadily with the addition of vc reaching 31 3 at the dose of 120 mmol l this increased further after adjusting the sludge ph to 3 0 surpassing vc120 at 33 5 in the vc70 ph3 treatment and reaching the maximum release of 38 4 in vc120 ph3 additionally due to the existence of residual water in the centrifuged sludge the fraction of loosely p in solid phase increased after the treatments reaching 30 2 in vc120 ph3 this kind of p release can exceed 95 by repeatedly washing the sludge with deionized water as a result the total release of p from the sludge further increased significantly to 59 3 and 67 1 in vc70 ph3 and vc120 ph3 respectively table 2 shows the effects of other kinds of pretreatments on p release from was for comparison this illustrated that greater p release can be achieved by decreasing the sludge ph directly or indirectly with acidic resin and co fermentation in this study the p release efficiency of 67 1 with p concentration of 542 mg l washed with deionized water was much higher than most previous studies and the release of both inorganic and organic p were higher however in an acid leaching experiment more stp 600 mg l was released than this study probably because anaerobically digested sludge was used so it has already undergone the reduction step and its ph was 2 which lead to a significant release of al p as well monea et al 2020a 3 3 3 effect of various treatments on sludge properties besides the massive release of p bonded with metals organic p was also released in the treatments shown in 3 3 2 which meant that vc treatment or ph adjustment also induced cell lysis in sludge therefore changes of the sludge s physical and chemical properties were also studied fig s4 shows that the scod of the sludge during treatment increased in a stepwise pattern from 59 mg l to 23 400 mg l as the vc dosage increased from 0 to 120 mmol l since vc also produces cod in water the rapid increase of the scod cannot describe the cell lysis process during treatment however compared to vc addition alone there was an increase of the scod concentration after ph adjustment which suggested that acidity promoted cell lysis the concentrations of polysaccharides protein and hs showed similar trends they continued to increase after vc was added and increased further with ph adjustment fig s4 b and c indicating that both vc and ph disrupted sludge flocs the trend seen in dna concentration corroborated this fig s4 c supernatant dna concentration in raw sludge was about 5 85 mg l and it rose to 130 mg l with vc30 and further to 374 mg l with vc120 additionally there was a slight increase in dna concentration with ph adjustment at low vc dosage 30 mmol l but this declined significantly at high vc dosage 70 mmol l this trend may have been due to promoted dna hydrolysis flow cytometric analysis in fig 7 shows that cells were mainly concentrated in the q1 zone debris and damaged cells and q4 zone live cells du et al 2021 after adding vc or adjusting the ph the proportion of debris and damaged cells in the q1 zone increased with diminishing live cells in the q4 zone co treatment with vc and acidification accelerated cell apoptosis and this effect was severely enhanced in vc120 ph3 where the percentage of debris and damaged cells reached 27 8 in accordance with a previous study lin et al 2006 the reason for this phenomenon may be that the oxidation of extracellular vc to dehydroresorcinolates generates h2o2 causing dna single strand breaks thereby reducing atp synthesis and driving cell apoptosis chen et al 2007 additionally the sem images in fig s5 show that the cells shrunk significantly after the addition of vc further supporting the evidence for cell apoptosis adjusting the ph to 3 0 caused most of the cells swell and undergo cell membrane lysis 3 4 synthesis of vivianite a large amount of fe was retained in the solid phase during sulfide treatment fe2 was also released with po4 3 into the supernatant during vc treatment providing abundant raw materials for vivianite synthesis eq 6 the synthesized sample was obtained by adjusting the solution ph to 7 0 while a standard sample was also synthesized directly using chemical agent for comparison the p recovery for the standard sample and the synthesized sample were 98 and 88 while the recovery of fe reached 100 and 99 demonstrating the feasibility of recovering both elements lower recovery of the latter may have been due to the complex organic substances in the supernatant xrd spectra showed that both the standard sample and synthesized sample provided a good match with the standard card of vivianite fig 8 a the particle size was analyzed using lpsa and fig 8 b showed that the particle size of the synthesized sample 11 6 μm was smaller than that of the standard sample 33 4 μm which was corroborated by the micrographs in fig 8 c and d in addition the micrographs also showed that the color of the synthesized sample appeared blue green which was due to the blue and green color of vivianite when it is oxidized by exposure to air zhang et al 2022 6 2 p o 4 3 3 f e 2 8 h 2 o f e 3 p o 4 2 8 h 2 o 3 5 discussion since p is the main pollutant causing eutrophication more than 90 of p in sewage is removed and transferred to sludge as organic p and inorganic p li and li 2017 barriers to p release include chemical bonds in organic p such as phosphate anhydride bonds p o p carbon phosphorus bonds p c and phosphate ester bonds p o c li et al 2022 the way phosphate binds to metal ions and the aging of the inorganic p and the complex environment of the sludge yu et al 2021 fe salts are widely applied for p removal in wwtps this study showed that fe p was the most important p species in sludge treated in this manner though organic p and other metal p compounds m p were also significant furthermore vc and h were demonstrated to be key determinants of p speciation and effective agents in driving p release during vc treatment fe iii p was reduced to fe ii p a portion of which were released as free fe2 and po4 3 into the supernatant during this process po4 3 reacted with metal ions to form m p or physically adsorbed on the sludge surface to form loosely p and then entered the solid phase again vc treatment also destroyed cells disrupting the floc structure of the sludge and releasing organic p from organic matter using ph adjustment alone po4 3 was released mainly by limited dissolution of fe ii p and m p and ph adjustment could not lyse sludge microbes to induce the release of organic p as demonstrated by both scod and dna shown in fig s4 under conditions of vc supplementation and acidity the content of dissolved m p was improved and most of the fe iii p contained in sludge was reduced the reason for the increase in the reduced amount of fe iii p by the same vc content could be ascribed to the solubility difference between fe iii p and fe ii p fe iii p mainly exists in the form of fepo4 and fe oh 3 adsorbed p and the solubility of these two compounds is 1 7 10 9 and 2 5 10 8 respectively while the solubility of the reduction products of fe3 po4 2 and fe oh 2 are 6 3 10 8 and 9 10 4 under standard conditions of ph 7 0 and 25 c solubility of particular compounds can be enhanced by changes in ph thus the majority of fe ii p molecules were dissolved and released into the supernatant in the acidic conditions which provided more opportunities for vc to react with fe iii p pulled from sludge sediment that is the acid accelerated the reduction 67 1 p release was obtained in this study however the solubility difference between fe3 po4 2 and fepo4 is small so a portion of the fe ii p generated by reduction was retained in the precipitate the coexistence of fe2 and po4 3 provided the opportunity to recover them both in the form of vivianite by adjusting the solution to ph 7 0 the results of this study show that vc addition and acidity are effective for mobilization of p from sludge compared to other pretreatment methods thus offering great promise for practical applications of p recovery however some impurities persisted in the product and further studies are needed to develop methods to increase the purity of the vivianite vc is environmentally friendly and inexpensive improving its utility in a variety of engineering applications the separation of metal ions from sludge is reported to be helpful in improving the efficiency of ad in sludge xu et al 2017 additionally most wwtps currently face the dilemma of inadequate carbon supply hampering ad utilization this dilemma could be solved using cod rich sludge produced in this study as inputs for ad this could also achieve sludge reduction at the same time the biogas produced by ad could generate further economic benefits as biomass energy in conclusion the method reported here improved the recovery of both fe and p in sludge and provides the possibility of carbon recovery applications 4 conclusions this study is the first attempt to enhance p release by reducing fe iii p contained in sludge by using vc as reductant this method exhibited good performance in releasing p from sludge especially under acidic conditions ph 3 0 the amount of p released was positively correlated with the amount of reductant and the highest p release was achieved at a dose of 120 mmol l vc accounting for 67 1 of the total p in sludge which is far superior to existing p extraction methods this enhanced p extraction is facilitated by the synergistic effect between vc and acidity fe iii p was reduced by vc to fe ii p which was quickly dissolved under acid conditions to release fe2 and po4 3 furthermore vc destroys sludge microbes leading to organic p efflux additionally al p and ca p were dissolved and released p to the aqueous phase but their contribution was quite limited due to the weakly acidic environment the released p and fe were recovered as vivianite with a recovery rate of 88 and 99 respectively declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing interests or

15245,due to the widespread application of various iron fe derived substances used in phosphorus p removal during wastewater treatment fe p species generated in this process constitute an important part of p speciation in non digested sludge sem eds and sequential extraction methods were utilized to analyze the speciation distribution and spatial variation of p contained in the sludge inorganic p accounted for 91 3 of the total p and fe iii p represented the greatest percentage 68 5 in the inorganic p fraction ascorbic acid also known as vitamin c vc performed well in releasing p from sludge especially in combination with subsequent ph adjustment to 3 0 using hcl fe iii p in sludge was first reduced to fe ii p by vc then dissolved in acidic conditions to release fe2 and po4 3 other metal p compounds were also partially dissolved and released vc disrupted the sludge floc structure releasing organic p via organic efflux there was a positive correlation r2 0 97 p 0 05 between the amount of released p and the amount of reductant vc there was a synergistic effect between 120 mmol l vc and acidity producing the greatest p release of 67 1 of total sludge p the p release efficiency achieved in this study was higher than other reported methods additionally vc provides a more sustainable option due to its natural biodegradability released p and fe2 can be recovered as vivianite with recovery rates of 88 and 99 respectively this finding provides a new direction for effective sustainable sludge p recovery and utilization graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords

introduction phosphorus p is an important biological component of cell membrane phospholipids nucleic acids and the energy carrier adenosine triphosphate atp thus human activities consume large amounts of p which is mainly derived from p mining at present wilfert et al 2015 accounting for about 19 7 mt p year as the population increases and diet structure changes the demand for p ore is expected to increase ding et al 2022 vaccari et al 2019 and lead to a sharp decline in p ore resources and thus limited output moreover p is essentially discharged to water bodies after p ore extraction and is then combined with metal ions to sediment it disrupting the p cycle marin batista et al 2020 zhu et al 2022 therefore the recovery of p before its discharge into water bodies is important to restore this cycle which is of great significance for resource sustainability approximately 1 3 mt p per year is treated by wastewater treatment plants wwtps and is deposited in the sludge li and li 2017 van vuuren et al 2010 if this p can be effectively recovered p ore mining could be reduced by approximately 6 5 10 concurrently to meet increasingly stringent emission standards and alleviate eutrophication increasingly more wwtps are adopting chemical p removal as an alternative to traditional biological p removal such that inorganic p is now commonly the dominant form in sludge shi et al 2020 considering the attractive price of fe salts they are widely applied in wwtps in china as p removal agents fan et al 2018 and so fe p represents a huge proportion of the total inorganic p li et al 2018 typical p recovery methods require pretreatment to release p from the sludge to the liquid phase and then recover it as mineral precipitates a variety of pretreatment methods have been used to release p including anaerobic digestion ad ph adjustment chelator treatment resin exchange sulfide reduction free ammonia treatment and thermal pretreatment yu et al 2021 ding et al 2022 ping et al 2020 shi et al 2020 wilfert et al 2020 xu et al 2018 xu et al 2015 among them chelator treatment reduction and ph adjustment reportedly have good performance in releasing inorganic p from sludge the release of p by chelasnts achieved by preventing charged p species adsorption to sludge and therefore mainly affects metal p compounds in addition to the common chelator ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta zou et al 2017 there are environmentally friendly chelators tannic acid ta polyaspartic acid pasp and sodium gluconate sg chen et al 2022 however the degree of their chelating ability on metals varies and needs further exploration using ph adjustment studies have shown that copious inorganic p can be dissolved under acidic conditions in addition to aiding organic p release alkaline conditions could mobilize al p but exhibited a negative effect on ca p release chen et al 2019 xu et al 2015 however extremely acidic conditions ph 2 0 were required to break the interaction between metal p compounds monea et al 2020a monea et al 2020b which posed difficulties for subsequent sludge disposal such as dewatering lu et al 2022 therefore it is necessary to develop methods to enhance p release under milder conditions fe ii p is more unstable than fe iii p and can therefore be dissolved causing p release even under weakly acidic conditions dmitri 2012 previous studies adopted both bio reduction and chemical reduction to mobilize p wang et al 2020 lippens and de vrieze 2019 ad a common bio reduction system promoted inorganic p and fe release by dissimilatory iron reducing bacteria in addition to anaerobic organic p release from phosphate accumulating organisms paos wu et al 2020 unfortunately ad is time intensive and the digestive performance is variable resulting in inconsistent p release efficiency therefore chemical reduction is more attractive sulfide was used for fe iii reduction at a molar ratio of 1 0 fe s to mobilize p in sludge which not only reduced fe iii but also formed fesx and provided a p release efficiency of about 31 wilfert et al 2020 however the propensity of sulfide in sludge not only deteriorated the dewatering performance but also posed challenges for subsequent sludge disposal wilfert et al 2020 ascorbic acid commonly known as vitamin c vc is an inexpensive easily available and environmentally friendly single electron reducing agent that can circumvent the disadvantages of sulfide its ability to reduce fe iii to fe ii has been extensively studied in the medical field cameron and campbell 1974 moertel et al 1985 due to the improved solubility of fe ii salts under acidic conditions enhanced p release could in theory be achieved by further decreasing sludge ph after the treatment of vc reduction additionally not only p but also fe ca al mg and other metal ions would be released into the liquid phase during this type of pretreatment except sulfide reduction providing the additional possibility of recovering these metals for example the coexistence of po4 3 and fe2 in the solution allowed them to be recovered in the form of vivianite by adjusting ph prot et al 2020 however reports on the application of vc in reducing fe iii to improve p release from sludge are rare the aim of this study is to enhance p release from waste sludge by vc reduction and acid dissolution first the distribution of p speciation in raw sludge was investigated second both the p and fe2 release profile as well as the efficiency of p species transformation by vc reduction followed by acid dissolution was examined these results were compared against a variety of agents to understand the reaction mechanism behind this treatment third p and fe in the liquid were recovered in the form of vivianite 2 materials and methods 2 1 waste activated sludge waste activated sludge was was taken from the secondary sedimentation tank after gravity thickening in chongqing jiguanshi wwtp the plant adopted the anaerobic anoxic oxic process and added iron salt in the connection pipeline between aeration tank and sedimentation tank to assist p removal the obtained was was pre concentrated in a refrigerator at 4 c for 24 h after which decanted the supernatant from the settled was to yield a higher total solids ts and avoid p release induced by microbial activities main parameters of the pre concentrated was were as follows ts 31 5 g l volatile solid vs 13 4 2 1 g l ph 7 5 0 1 and po4 3 concentration was 0 014 0 001 mg l weight proportion of main elements contained in the pre concentrated was were summarized in table 1 and fe is the dominate metallic element followed by al the high al value is due to the use of al based coagulant in the high density flocculation tank of the wwtp 2 2 test for enhancing p release 2 2 1 role of different agents and ph experiments were performed in 50 ml centrifuge tubes two experimental groups including ph adjustment and vc addition with ph adjustment were built additionally p release profile by using different kinds of chelators addition was also presented to give a comparison each group consisted of 4 types of working conditions for the ph adjustment group the ph of the sludge was adjusted to 3 0 4 0 and 5 0 by using 2 0 m hcl and naoh named as ph3 ph4 ph5 the raw sludge without ph adjustment was set as control named as raw the group of vc addition with ph adjustment adding 30 mmol l vc to the sludge and then adjusting the sludge ph to 3 0 4 0 and 5 0 named as vc30 ph3 vc30 ph4 vc30 ph5 additionally the sample with only vc addition was prepared as control named as vc30 the chelator added group 30 mmol l edta was added and ta pasp and sg were added with the same amount named as edta ta pasp and sg the centrifuge tubes were shaken for 2 hours after adding of these chemicals under 25 c with the shaken speed of 200 rpm after finishing the reaction the supernatant was centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 10 min and filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane to analyze concentrations of po4 3 and soluble total p stp 2 2 2 effect of vc concentrations to optimize the vc dosage in p releasing from sludge experiments were also performed in two groups group a and b the ph of group b was adjusted to 3 0 while no adjustment was adopted in the group a different vc dosages 0 10 20 30 40 50 70 100 120 and 150 mmol l were adopted in both groups 2 3 explore the effect mechanism of vc and ph the sludge was divided into two equal portions one with 0 30 70 and 120 mmol l vc dosing typical concentrations in section 2 2 2 and the rests were treated by ph adjustment to 3 0 all were shaken and then centrifuged the supernatant was collected for analysis and the residue was lyophilized for subsequent p extraction and characterization the raw sludge and obtained samples were named as raw ph3 vc30 vc30 ph3 vc70 vc70 ph3 vc120 and vc120 ph3 based on the improved sedex method ruttenberg et al 2009 and sequential extraction of inorganic p kovar and pierzynski 2009 a new 7 step sequential extraction method of p from lyophilized sludge was proposed by combining with the optimized extraction process of fe ii p gu et al 2016 the extraction process is shown in fig s1 0 2 g of lyophilized sludge was precisely weighed for sequential extraction of p speciation the extracted p speciation contains loosely p mainly p physically adsorbed to metal oxides hydroxides and carbonates fe ii p which is unoxidized fe p al p mainly as aluminum phosphate and hydrated aluminum phosphate fe iii p which is trivalent iron phosphorus compounds reductant extracted p reductant p mainly precipitates or colloid encapsulated p formed by metal oxides ca p from authigenic formation and organic p from microbial cells 2 4 synthesis of vivianite extra k2hpo4 3h2o was added to the supernatant of vc70 ph3 to make the molar ratio of fe2 to po4 3 at about 1 5 the solution ph was adjusted to 7 0 gradually by using 1 m naoh under anaerobic condition to react for 1 h and then aged for 2 h the precipitates were washed and then dried under vacuum at 35 c for comparison standard reference sample was synthesized from 0 2 m of k2hpo4 3h2o and 0 3 m of feso4 7h2o solution at ph 7 to obtain pure vivianite crystals the recovery efficiency r and of fe2 and po4 3 are calculated using the following eq 1 respectively 1 r c o c t c

represent a statistically significant difference a split peak fit for fe 2p was performed with the xps peak 41 program 3 results and discussion 3 1 distribution of p in raw sludge sludge in secondary sedimentation tanks is composed of both microbes and inorganic minerals to explore the distribution of p in these two components sem eds analysis was performed p was a major element on the surface of both the organismal and inorganic fractions of sludge comprising 7 25 and 10 27 of each weight respectively fig s2 b and c p on the organismal fraction surface is mainly in the form of teichoic acid formed by phosphodiester bonding zhang et al 2021 on the inorganic fraction surface p is mainly combined with fe al ca and mg to form inorganic p species such as fe p al p ca p and mg p fig s2 c which is in accordance with previous work li et al 2018 however eds can only qualitatively analyze the particle surface and cannot determine the binding state of metal ions with p to further investigate the specific distribution of p in raw sludge a seven step extraction method was adopted for the sequential determination of p speciation as shown in fig 1 fe iii p was the most abundant p species in the raw sludge accounting for 62 5 of the total sludge p followed by al p organic p and ca p at respective percentages of 20 7 8 7 and 3 1 this was consistent with a previous report on p distribution in sludge zhang et al 2019 in contrast for the sludge obtained from the wwtps with an enhanced biological p removal unit fe p accounted for only 24 and organic p reached 15 wang et al 2020 moreover loosely sorbed p loosely p in adsorbed form and unoxidized fe ii p are also present 2 3 additionally the p contained in the supernatant of the sludge was less than 0 01mg l indicating that most of the p was transferred to the precipitate after the combination of biological and fe salt treatment therefore the release of inorganic p especially fe p from this sludge type is of great significance for p recovery 3 2 selection of agent concentration and ph 3 2 1 effect of various agents and ph on p release from sludge the p release profile for different experimental groups is shown in fig 2 for the ph adjusted group the po4 3 was only present in the supernatant of the raw sludge at ph 5 0 to 3 0 and the maximum concentration released was 18 2 mg l at ph 3 0 this is due to the fact that the solubility of inorganic p correlates to solution ph with higher dissolution obtained at greater acidity for the 30 mmol l vc treatment the released amount of po4 3 without any ph adjustment reached 22 5 mg l this may be because vc reduced fe iii p in sludge to fe ii p and there was a partial release of p in the reduction process due to the variable molar ratio of fe to p eq 2 wang et al 2018 the release of po4 3 was further increased after adjusting ph the amount of released po4 3 at ph 5 0 4 0 and 3 0 was 33 4 124 3 and 194 8 mg l respectively vc supplementation promoted p release at all ph conditions and the most significant improvement due to vc was observed at ph 3 0 where released po4 3 was 10 6 times higher than with ph adjustment alone this result can be explained by the higher solubility of fe ⅱ compounds than fe ⅲ compounds under the same ph which is consistent with the variation of the morphology of different valence states of fe with ph in the pourbaix diagram dmitri 2012 the morphological changes of particular fe p speciation events during the reaction process are analyzed in detail in section 3 3 2 due to the propensity of p released in ph 3 0 this ph condition was also used for subsequent experiments 2 3 f e p o 4 3 e f e 3 p o 4 2 p o 4 3 p release using chelants is intensely studied because chelants can mobilize multivalent metal ions ping et al 2020 it has been reported that complexing agents not only leach p from sludge ash but can also enhance p release from anaerobic fermentation fang et al 2018 xu et al 2021 for comparison the p release with a variety of chelants is also shown in fig 2 all chelants in this study enhanced p release efficiencies among which edta presented the best performance resulting in 76 2 mg l po4 3 concentration in the supernatant furthermore the release of p is highly dependent on the type of chelants which agrees with a previous study ping et al 2020 comparing the three groups above illustrates the superiority of vc ph treatment in releasing p from sludge therefore further research was carried out to further optimize the vc ph group and elucidate the mechanism responsible for these improvements 3 2 2 optimization of vc dosage considering the hypothesis that vc reduces fe iii to fe ii and therefore the dosage of vc could be the key parameter in determining overall reduction efficiency additionally vc dosing impacts slurry ph because vc itself carries some hydrogen ions table s1 therefore there may be variable effectiveness among vc dosages on p release from sludge as shown in fig 3 a and b at increasing vc dosage the trend of p release and soluble fe2 sfe2 was a curve with initially slow then subsequently rapid increase before finally leveling off suggesting that vc indeed works on fe iii p impaired release of p at low vc dosage may be ascribed to the limited reduction capability under such conditions additionally it is also possible that at low vc dosages the slurry ph remained stable and therefore the dissolution of fe ii p was quite limited ph adjustment was investigated to further drive the release of p from the sludge shown in fig 3 a both p and sfe2 increased rapidly with a combination of vc treatment and acidic conditions ph 3 0 overall the p release in the combined vc supplementation and acidic treatment was significantly higher than the groups using vc or ph modification alone the 30 mmol l vc treatment produced the most pronounced effect resulting in about 4 8 times higher than the sum of using either ph or vc p release plateaued when the vc dosage exceeded 70 mmol l indicating that fe iii p was rapidly and continuously reduced to fe ii p at vc 70 mmol l and was dissolved after adjustment to ph 3 0 the concentration of sfe2 almost reached the theoretical maximum 1628 mg l with the addition of 70 mmol l of vc indicating that fe iii in the sludge had been almost completely reduced at the vc dosage of 120 mmol l the supernatant stp concentration was enhanced potentially due to cell lysis releasing organic p due to excessive vc concentration furthermore plotting released fe2 and po4 3 revealed a significant positive correlation p 0 05 r2 0 96 between fe2 and po4 3 in dosage of vc alone and in combination with acidity fig 3 c indicating that the reduction and dissolution of fe iii p determines the release of po4 3 into aqueous solution to verify this 30 70 and 120 mmol l of vc were selected for follow up experiments to further explore the mechanism of vc and ph on inorganic p especially fe p and organic p in cells 3 3 effect of vc and ph on the properties of p metals and sludge 3 3 1 p and metal ions in the supernatant ph adjustment not only affects the release of inorganic p by affecting the morphological transformation of metal p compounds xu et al 2015 but also induces organic p release by decomposing cells and organic matter zhang et al 2021 fig 4 a shows that the addition of vc introduces h that decreases the sludge s ph and that the ph values of these samples partially recovered after the reaction indicating that the reaction process consumes substantial amounts of h in addition the ph at the end of the reaction with vc30 at ph 3 0 later returns to 4 29 which is higher than the ph 4 03 achieved after the reaction of ph 3 0 alone verifying that the addition of vc promotes the utilization of h which can be explained as follows 1 fe iii is more stable than fe ii so h will act more easily on fe ii after the reduction of fe iii to fe ii 2 vc may complex metals thus physically loosening inorganic mineral structures or cells making it easier to contact h however as the concentration of vc was increased ph restoration diminished again this phenomenon probably occurs because vc70 and vc120 provided a considerable amount of h and then the reaction consumed less h after further adjusting the ph to 3 0 p and fe concentrations before and after treatment based on fig 3 are shown in fig 4 b and c at increasing vc concentration without ph adjustment both po4 3 and sfe2 concentrations increase reaching the maximum at 120 mmol l vc with their respective concentrations of 237 and 1516 mg l likely due to the effect of h delivered by vc itself for fepo4 and fe3 po4 2 as in eqs 3 and 4 after reducing fe iii moreover it is worth mentioning that there are synergistic effects between vc and h on the release of p and sfe2 after adjusting ph to 3 0 and this effect decreased with increasing vc concentration as mentioned in section 3 2 2 this situation can be explained by the nearly complete reduction of fe iii p to fe ii p followed by dissolution in vc70 ph3 in contrast the excess vc addition in vc120 ph3 only served to provide h for decreasing ph so the difference in sfe2 between the two was not as pronounced 1627 mg l and 1653 mg l respectively therefore though the corresponding po4 3 release in vc120 ph3 was the highest 292 mg l in the supernatant among the treatments it presented slightly higher than that in vc70 ph3 279 mg l in the supernatant 3 f e p o 4 3 h h 3 p o 4 f e 3 4 f e 3 p o 4 2 6 h 2 h 3 p o 4 3 f e 2 5 a l p o 4 3 h h 3 p o 4 a l 3 6 c a 3 p o 4 2 6 h 2 h 3 p o 4 3 c a 2 in addition the release of organic p difference between stp and po4 3 increased at greater vc concentration the maximum occurred at vc120 indicating that vc could indeed act on sludge microbiota this is consistent with previous reports that paos cells release poly p under low ph conditions to sustain homeostasis feng et al 2020 under acidic conditions some organic p will be hydrolyzed to po4 3 which explains why there is a decrease in organic p after ph adjustment fig 1 shows that in addition to fe p al p and ca p also account for a large amount of inorganic p in sludge under acidic conditions portions of these species may be dissolved and released into the liquid phase according to the reaction shown in eqs 3 6 fig 4 d shows that the concentration of al3 and mg2 in the supernatant followed the same trend as sfe2 but overall their concentration was much lower peak concentrations were 11 and 78 mg l at vc120 ph3 which indicates that ph changes also promote the release of al p and mg p but this effect was much smaller than that of fe moreover ca2 also increased with vc dosing ca2 concentration rose steeply by adjusting the ph to 3 0 while it dropped in vc30 ph3 and then increased with increasing vc fig 4 d it is presumed that a large amount of ca salts would be dissolved and released to the aqueous phase at ph 3 0 furthermore vc would complex some ca2 and the stability of the complex was positively correlated with ph therefore the maximum release of ca2 was still at vc120 ph3 which was 768 mg l the increased ca2 concentration in supernatant indicated promoted release of ca p 3 3 2 distribution of p speciation before and after sludge treatment to investigate which particular p speciation events contributed to p release sequential step by step p extraction was performed fig 5 the sum of p speciation extracted from each treatment was approximately 20 1 mg g ts which was consistent with the total p content shown in table 1 fe iii p content was inversely correlated with vc dosage 62 5 in raw sludge to only 9 0 in vc120 indicating that the fe iii p fraction was continuously reduced by vc an effect that was further intensified after ph adjustment to 3 0 therefore the depletion of fe iii p by vc was greatest in vc120 ph3 where the fe iii p fraction was further decreased to 3 4 the fraction of fe ii p yield showed the opposite trend increasing from 2 2 to 9 5 with the increase of vc dosage additionally there was a slight decrease 8 2 of fe ii p after ph adjustment revealing that some fe ii p was retained in the sludge at the end of the reaction instead of being released into the aqueous phase this mechanism will be discussed in detail in section 3 5 similar results were obtained from xps spectrogram analysis of the sludge s solid phase shown in fig s3 where the p 2p and fe 2p decreased gradually with increasing vc dosage and acidity the results of the fine spectrum of fe 2p were also analyzed and are presented in fig 6 as well as the area percentage of peaks in table 3 these figures show two main peaks near 710 6 ev fe 2p 3 2 and 724 7 ev fe 2p 1 2 which were observed for all samples lv et al 2015 for raw sludge and ph adjusted samples without vc supplementation the fe 2p 3 2 peak decomposed into two peaks at 711 4 ev and 715 4 ev implying the presence of an fe3 valence state for iron and satellite peaks liu et al 2016 omran et al 2015 the peak at fe 2p 1 2 was decomposed into two peaks of 725 0 ev and 730 0 ev which were also the fe3 peak and the satellite peak respectively with vc addition new peaks of 709 6 ev and 723 3 ev appeared at the positions of fe 2p 3 2 and fe 2p 1 2 which represented the fe2 chemical state bae et al 2018 shaw et al 2017 furthermore with increasing vc dose the peak area of fe3 state lowered proportionally and the peak area of the fe2 state proportionally increased from 4 3 in vc30 to 12 3 in vc70 and further to 15 5 in vc120 after ph adjustment the percentage of the peak area of fe2 increased further reaching its maximum at vc120 ph3 21 1 fig 5 shows that the fractions of ca p and al p decreased continuously with increasing vc dosage acidity further decreased their abundance in the sludge which agreed with the concentration of metal ions in the supernatant shown in fig 4 d this phenomenon may have been due to the ability of vc to complex metals ritacca et al 2022 and the fact that the h lowered the solution ph leading to ready dissolution of ca p and al p although organic p release in the solid phase with vc and ph treatment was consistent with that of the metal p compounds the combined amount of organic p in the solid and liquid phases was not constant these discrepancies in the combined p amount indicated that part of organic p was hydrolyzed under acidic conditions specifically acid stress can easily disrupt the phospholipid bilayer of microbial cell membranes containing functional proteins leading to the denaturation of functional proteins lund et al 2014 thus provoking the release of protein residues and lipid phosphorus intensifying the acidity can also break the basic group in organic p which leads to hydrolysis of lipids nucleic acids and proteins producing po4 3 organic matter pentose and peptides hirota et al 2010 the percentage of stp in raw sludge was almost zero but increased slightly to 3 after adjusting the sludge s ph to 3 0 stp rose steadily with the addition of vc reaching 31 3 at the dose of 120 mmol l this increased further after adjusting the sludge ph to 3 0 surpassing vc120 at 33 5 in the vc70 ph3 treatment and reaching the maximum release of 38 4 in vc120 ph3 additionally due to the existence of residual water in the centrifuged sludge the fraction of loosely p in solid phase increased after the treatments reaching 30 2 in vc120 ph3 this kind of p release can exceed 95 by repeatedly washing the sludge with deionized water as a result the total release of p from the sludge further increased significantly to 59 3 and 67 1 in vc70 ph3 and vc120 ph3 respectively table 2 shows the effects of other kinds of pretreatments on p release from was for comparison this illustrated that greater p release can be achieved by decreasing the sludge ph directly or indirectly with acidic resin and co fermentation in this study the p release efficiency of 67 1 with p concentration of 542 mg l washed with deionized water was much higher than most previous studies and the release of both inorganic and organic p were higher however in an acid leaching experiment more stp 600 mg l was released than this study probably because anaerobically digested sludge was used so it has already undergone the reduction step and its ph was 2 which lead to a significant release of al p as well monea et al 2020a 3 3 3 effect of various treatments on sludge properties besides the massive release of p bonded with metals organic p was also released in the treatments shown in 3 3 2 which meant that vc treatment or ph adjustment also induced cell lysis in sludge therefore changes of the sludge s physical and chemical properties were also studied fig s4 shows that the scod of the sludge during treatment increased in a stepwise pattern from 59 mg l to 23 400 mg l as the vc dosage increased from 0 to 120 mmol l since vc also produces cod in water the rapid increase of the scod cannot describe the cell lysis process during treatment however compared to vc addition alone there was an increase of the scod concentration after ph adjustment which suggested that acidity promoted cell lysis the concentrations of polysaccharides protein and hs showed similar trends they continued to increase after vc was added and increased further with ph adjustment fig s4 b and c indicating that both vc and ph disrupted sludge flocs the trend seen in dna concentration corroborated this fig s4 c supernatant dna concentration in raw sludge was about 5 85 mg l and it rose to 130 mg l with vc30 and further to 374 mg l with vc120 additionally there was a slight increase in dna concentration with ph adjustment at low vc dosage 30 mmol l but this declined significantly at high vc dosage 70 mmol l this trend may have been due to promoted dna hydrolysis flow cytometric analysis in fig 7 shows that cells were mainly concentrated in the q1 zone debris and damaged cells and q4 zone live cells du et al 2021 after adding vc or adjusting the ph the proportion of debris and damaged cells in the q1 zone increased with diminishing live cells in the q4 zone co treatment with vc and acidification accelerated cell apoptosis and this effect was severely enhanced in vc120 ph3 where the percentage of debris and damaged cells reached 27 8 in accordance with a previous study lin et al 2006 the reason for this phenomenon may be that the oxidation of extracellular vc to dehydroresorcinolates generates h2o2 causing dna single strand breaks thereby reducing atp synthesis and driving cell apoptosis chen et al 2007 additionally the sem images in fig s5 show that the cells shrunk significantly after the addition of vc further supporting the evidence for cell apoptosis adjusting the ph to 3 0 caused most of the cells swell and undergo cell membrane lysis 3 4 synthesis of vivianite a large amount of fe was retained in the solid phase during sulfide treatment fe2 was also released with po4 3 into the supernatant during vc treatment providing abundant raw materials for vivianite synthesis eq 6 the synthesized sample was obtained by adjusting the solution ph to 7 0 while a standard sample was also synthesized directly using chemical agent for comparison the p recovery for the standard sample and the synthesized sample were 98 and 88 while the recovery of fe reached 100 and 99 demonstrating the feasibility of recovering both elements lower recovery of the latter may have been due to the complex organic substances in the supernatant xrd spectra showed that both the standard sample and synthesized sample provided a good match with the standard card of vivianite fig 8 a the particle size was analyzed using lpsa and fig 8 b showed that the particle size of the synthesized sample 11 6 μm was smaller than that of the standard sample 33 4 μm which was corroborated by the micrographs in fig 8 c and d in addition the micrographs also showed that the color of the synthesized sample appeared blue green which was due to the blue and green color of vivianite when it is oxidized by exposure to air zhang et al 2022 6 2 p o 4 3 3 f e 2 8 h 2 o f e 3 p o 4 2 8 h 2 o 3 5 discussion since p is the main pollutant causing eutrophication more than 90 of p in sewage is removed and transferred to sludge as organic p and inorganic p li and li 2017 barriers to p release include chemical bonds in organic p such as phosphate anhydride bonds p o p carbon phosphorus bonds p c and phosphate ester bonds p o c li et al 2022 the way phosphate binds to metal ions and the aging of the inorganic p and the complex environment of the sludge yu et al 2021 fe salts are widely applied for p removal in wwtps this study showed that fe p was the most important p species in sludge treated in this manner though organic p and other metal p compounds m p were also significant furthermore vc and h were demonstrated to be key determinants of p speciation and effective agents in driving p release during vc treatment fe iii p was reduced to fe ii p a portion of which were released as free fe2 and po4 3 into the supernatant during this process po4 3 reacted with metal ions to form m p or physically adsorbed on the sludge surface to form loosely p and then entered the solid phase again vc treatment also destroyed cells disrupting the floc structure of the sludge and releasing organic p from organic matter using ph adjustment alone po4 3 was released mainly by limited dissolution of fe ii p and m p and ph adjustment could not lyse sludge microbes to induce the release of organic p as demonstrated by both scod and dna shown in fig s4 under conditions of vc supplementation and acidity the content of dissolved m p was improved and most of the fe iii p contained in sludge was reduced the reason for the increase in the reduced amount of fe iii p by the same vc content could be ascribed to the solubility difference between fe iii p and fe ii p fe iii p mainly exists in the form of fepo4 and fe oh 3 adsorbed p and the solubility of these two compounds is 1 7 10 9 and 2 5 10 8 respectively while the solubility of the reduction products of fe3 po4 2 and fe oh 2 are 6 3 10 8 and 9 10 4 under standard conditions of ph 7 0 and 25 c solubility of particular compounds can be enhanced by changes in ph thus the majority of fe ii p molecules were dissolved and released into the supernatant in the acidic conditions which provided more opportunities for vc to react with fe iii p pulled from sludge sediment that is the acid accelerated the reduction 67 1 p release was obtained in this study however the solubility difference between fe3 po4 2 and fepo4 is small so a portion of the fe ii p generated by reduction was retained in the precipitate the coexistence of fe2 and po4 3 provided the opportunity to recover them both in the form of vivianite by adjusting the solution to ph 7 0 the results of this study show that vc addition and acidity are effective for mobilization of p from sludge compared to other pretreatment methods thus offering great promise for practical applications of p recovery however some impurities persisted in the product and further studies are needed to develop methods to increase the purity of the vivianite vc is environmentally friendly and inexpensive improving its utility in a variety of engineering applications the separation of metal ions from sludge is reported to be helpful in improving the efficiency of ad in sludge xu et al 2017 additionally most wwtps currently face the dilemma of inadequate carbon supply hampering ad utilization this dilemma could be solved using cod rich sludge produced in this study as inputs for ad this could also achieve sludge reduction at the same time the biogas produced by ad could generate further economic benefits as biomass energy in conclusion the method reported here improved the recovery of both fe and p in sludge and provides the possibility of carbon recovery applications 4 conclusions this study is the first attempt to enhance p release by reducing fe iii p contained in sludge by using vc as reductant this method exhibited good performance in releasing p from sludge especially under acidic conditions ph 3 0 the amount of p released was positively correlated with the amount of reductant and the highest p release was achieved at a dose of 120 mmol l vc accounting for 67 1 of the total p in sludge which is far superior to existing p extraction methods this enhanced p extraction is facilitated by the synergistic effect between vc and acidity fe iii p was reduced by vc to fe ii p which was quickly dissolved under acid conditions to release fe2 and po4 3 furthermore vc destroys sludge microbes leading to organic p efflux additionally al p and ca p were dissolved and released p to the aqueous phase but their contribution was quite limited due to the weakly acidic environment the released p and fe were recovered as vivianite with a recovery rate of 88 and 99 respectively declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing interests or

15246,halophenolic disinfection byproducts dbps are a class of emerging pollutants whose adverse effects on human cells and the underlying molecular mechanisms still need further exploration in this study we found that when halophenolic dbps were substituted with the same halogen the more substitution sites the more cytotoxic while when they were substituted at the same sites the most toxic chemical was iodophenols followed by bromophenols and chlorophenols in addition several of them exerted significant endocrine disrupting effects at sublethal concentrations 2 4 6 triiodophenol tip and 2 4 dichlorophenol 2 4 dcp showed the highest estradiol equivalent factor eef of 4 41 10 8 and flutamide equivalent factor fef of 0 4 respectively furthermore all of the halophenolic dbps except for 2 chlorophenol 2 cp and 2 bromophenol 2 bp significantly increased the levels of reactive oxygen species ros or 8 hydroxydeoxyguanosine 8 ohdg in hepg2 cells the lowest cytotoxicity and unchanged ros and 8 ohdg levels after 2 cp exposure may result from the activation of the transporters of the adenosine triphosphate atp binding cassette in cells transcriptome analysis revealed distinct grouping patterns of 2 cp 2 6 dibromophenol 2 6 dbp and tip at the concentrations of ec20 and the top differentially expressed genes degs were involved in the antioxidant immune and endocrine associated systems the weighted gene correlation network analysis well connected the phenotypes ec50 eef fef ros 8 ohdg and abc transporters with the degs and revealed that the mapk signaling pathway played a vital role in regulating the biological response after exposure to halophenolic dbps this study provides deep insights into the underlying mechanisms of the toxic effects induced by halophenolic dbps graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords halophenolic disinfection byproducts cytotoxicity endocrine disrupting effects transcriptomics wgcna data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction halophenols are important chemical products which have been serving as disinfectants pesticides herbicides and dyes for decades sumithran et al 2012 in 2013 several of them were identified as a newly emerging class of disinfection byproducts dbps that could be formed from the reaction between organic matter and chlorine disinfectants pan and zhang 2013 since then halophenolic dbps have been frequently reported in many post disinfection scenarios including drinking water swimming pool water and sewage wastewater gong and zhang 2015 xiao et al 2012 the reported concentrations of halophenolic dbps are usually at the ng l to μg l level in disinfected water and are relatively lower than those commonly detected trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas pan et al 2017 yang et al 2019 however their human health risks should not be neglected due to multiple exposure routes including drinking water inhalation skin contact and bioaccumulation shi et al 2018 a former study applied granular activated carbon to remove intermediate aromatic halogenated dbps and found it significantly reduced the developmental toxicity of chlorinated drinking water jiang et al 2017 implying the importance to investigate the toxicity of halophenolic dbps since the detection of halophenolic dbps researchers have endeavored to determine their intrinsic toxicities and compare them with other regulated dbps for instance it was found that 2 4 6 triiodophenol tip exerted higher cytotoxicity to chinese hamster ovary cho cells than all thms and most haas wagner and plewa 2017 in addition the developmental toxicity of halophenolic dbps to the marine polychaete platynereis dumerilii was higher than those of all tested haas yang and zhang 2013 similarly halophenolic dbps were reported to exert significantly higher toxicity to the alga tetraselmis marina than the commonly known haas liu and zhang 2014 in summary existing studies have primarily focused on the toxicity of partial halophenolic dbps to aquatic organisms and animal cells zhang et al 2020 although jiang 2004 explored the cytotoxicity of chlorophenols on human hepatocellular liver carcinoma hepg2 cells and leonetti et al 2018 detected the endocrine disrupting potential of bromophenols on human cells as far as we know there is no systematic report about the toxic effects such as cytotoxicity endocrine disrupting effects and oxidative stress of these halophenol dbps which have been proven in other phenolic compounds huang et al 2020 regarding the toxic mechanisms of halophenols a previous study found that 2 4 dichlorophenol 2 4 dcp decreased basal mitochondrial respiration and adenosine triphosphate atp production in fish embryos li et al 2018a the uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation may also result in the toxicity of chlorophenols to intact cells shannon et al 1991 kollitz et al 2018 found the affinity of 2 4 6 tribromophenol tbp for human thyroid receptor beta suggesting its potential to interfere with thyroid hormone metabolism and transport michalowicz et al 2022 however the underlying mechanisms of the cytotoxicity and endocrine disrupting effects of halophenolic dbps are still unclear from the genetic perspective this study aimed to systematically investigate the cytotoxicity endocrine disrupting effects and oxidative damage upon exposure to seven reported halophenolic dbps 2 chlorophenol 2 cp 2 bromophenol 2 bp 2 4 dcp 2 6 dibromophenol 2 6 dbp 2 4 6 trichlorophenol tcp tbp and tip based on a series of human cell platforms bromoacetic acid baa which belongs to haa was chosen as a typical representative of regulated dbps for comparison biomarkers in the antioxidant system including reactive oxygen species ros and 8 hydroxydeoxyguanosine 8 ohdg were determined to evaluate the oxidative stress of these pollutants transcriptome analysis a powerful tool to uncover the underlying molecular mechanisms coupled with weighted gene correlation network analysis wgcna was applied to explore the underlying toxic mechanisms of halophenolic dbps overall the findings of this study will provide fundamental information for screening the toxicity of halophenolic dbps and evaluating their potential health risk to human beings 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals 2 cp 2 bp 2 4 dcp 2 6 dbp tcp tbp tip estradiol e2 dihydrotestosterone dht flutamide flu tamoxifen txf glutamine purity 99 and dimethyl sulfoxide dmso chromatographic purity were purchased from the sigma aldrich inc and baa was purchased from the j k scientific inc 2 2 cell culture and viability test hepg2 cells were cultured in dulbecco s modified eagle s medium dmem gibco u s a with 10 fetal bovine serum fbs gibco u s a at 37 c in a humidified atmosphere of 5 co2 for cytotoxicity assessment shi et al 2015 mda kb2 cells were cultured in l 15 medium containing 1 penicillin streptomycin 1 glutamine and 10 fbs in a 90 humidified atmosphere of 100 air at 37 c to test the androgenic and anti androgenic activities the bioluminescent mce 7 derived cell line mvln was cultured in dmem containing 1 penicillin streptomycin 1 glutamine and 10 fbs in a 90 humidified atmosphere of 95 air and 5 co2 at 37 c to test the estrogenic and anti estrogenic activities the cytotoxicity of each sample was determined by a cck 8 reagent keygen china based on the hepg2 cell line all the compounds were dissolved in dmso and the working solutions were freshly diluted in dmem with 10 fbs to a final concentration of 0 1 dmso v v first approximately 5000 cells per well were seeded into a 96 well microplate and incubated for 24 h then the concentrated samples with a series of concentrations were added to each plate well for an additional 24 h incubation the negative control nc group was 0 1 dmso the positive control pc was 0 1 phenol and the blank control bc group was the fresh medium without any additional substance subsequently 10 μl of cck 8 solution was added to each well of the plate and spectrophotometric measurement of the mixture was performed with a microplate reader bio tek winooski vt u s a at a wavelength of 450 nm after incubation for 1 h the cell viability was calculated based on the absorbance to generate each sample s concentration response curve and regression analysis was applied to calculate the ec10 to ec80 values according to heger et al 2012 2 3 assessment of endocrine disrupting effects ec20 value is commonly regarded as a threshold for acute toxicity and many toxicity tests adopted them to evaluate the sub lethal effects of toxicants gao et al 2019 in this case according to the cytotoxicity results the ec20 value was applied as the highest concentration for each compound in the tests of endocrine disrupting effects first mda kb2 cells or mvln cells were seeded in 384 well plates at 1 6 104 cells per well and exposed to different concentrations of halophenolic dbps for 24 h and standard curves were included on each plate by applying serially diluted e2 dht flu or txf solutions in the assay medium at the end of exposure the plates were rinsed with phosphate buffer saline pbs keygen china twice and then 10 μl of cell lysate was added to each well after 10 min of vibration 25 µl of luciferase detection reagent was added to each well and then the fluorescence was recorded by a microplate reader bio tek winooski vt u s a protein content was used as an internal standard to calibrate the luminescence values 12 5 μl of fluorescamine 0 5 g l diluted in acetonitrile was added to each well and fluorometric measurements were conducted at 355 460 nm wavelength according to a standard curve of bovine serum albumin glibo u s a in assays the results are expressed as a ration to maximal luciferase activity induced by the pc of 0 1 nm e2 on mvln cells or 1 nm dht on mda kb2 cells respectively in addition the e2 equivalent factor eef and the flu equivalent factor fef were calculated according to eqs 1 and 2 to indicate the estrogenic and anti androgenic activities respectively more details about the quantitative methods of the endocrine disrupting effects are summarized in text s1 of the supporting information the standard curves for dht e2 flu and txf was presented in fig s2 accordingly ec50 values for dht e2 flu and txf were calculated as 0 086 0 002 2300 and 5 6 nm respectively 1 eef e c 50 e 2 e c 50 test compound 2 fef e c 50 ful e c 50 test compound 2 4 ros and 8 ohdg determination hepg2 cells were exposed to baa and seven halophenolic dbps at the ec20 values for 24 h in black wall 96 well plates after incubation the cells were washed twice with cold pbs and resuspended in pbs at 5 105 cells per milliliter then the intracellular ros and 8 ohdg contents were determined according to the instructions of the ros kit jiancheng china and human 8 ohdg elisa kit jiancheng china respectively the preparation for the nc and bc groups was the same as the cytotoxicity test the results were calibrated with protein content which have been descripted above 2 5 membrane transporter activity test active drug efflux depends on transporters of the atp binding cassette abc containing family of proteins which is an essential mechanism for preventing access of chemicals to targets nikaido 1994 we chose the activity of the abc transporter as a target to measure the influence of 2 cp 2 6 dbp tip and baa on transmembrane proteins by testing the accumulation of the cell probe calcein am cam cam is a nonfluorescent highly lipid soluble dye that can rapidly penetrate the plasma membrane of cells and be transferred to fluorescent calcein calcein f eneroth et al 2001 the exposure concentration series was set at ec20 ec20 10 ec20 100 and ec20 1000 for each test compound after exposure 0 25 μm cam was added to each well of 96 well plates with black wall after incubating and washing 2 5 μg ml hoechst 33342 abbkine u s a was added to each well for counting the number of live hepg2 cells the excitation emission wavelengths of cam were 485 530 nm the fluorescence value of cam was normalized to the number of live hepg2 cells which was determined by the fluorescence value of hoechst 33342 in the same well the pc was 50 μm of mk 571 solution the nc was 0 1 dmso and the bc was fresh medium without any additional substance 2 6 isolation of rna and sequencing 2 cp 2 6 dbp and tip were chosen for rna seq and the concentration set was the same as the membrane transporter activity test the difference was that hepg2 cells were cultured in 6 well plates the nc groups were the same as the cytotoxicity test at the end of exposure total rna was extracted with the trizol reagent invitrogen carlsbad ca u s a and purified with the qiagen rneasy minirna cleanup kit qiagen germantown md u s a three pooled replicates of rna seq by the illumina hiseqtm 2500 were applied for each experimental group 2 7 statistical analysis three replicants were performed for all tests and the results were expressed as the average avg standard deviation sd dose response curves were processed by graphpad prism version 8 3 sequencing raw data denoising was conducted by trimmomatic software version 0 36 subsequently the clean reads were mapped to the human reference genome through hisat2 version 2 0 4 with the default parameters after being scored by htseq the clean sequencing data score over 10 were processed to identify the degs through the edger package version 4 0 in r software version 4 2 1 genes with a fold change of more than 2 0 and p 0 05 were considered significant degs zhou et al 2020 the biological significance of the degs was analyzed based on the go terms and the kegg pathway database using david bioinformatics resources 6 8 https david ncifcrf gov the coexpression network was constructed using the wgcna r package langfelder and horvath 2008 comparisons between nc groups and experimental groups were performed using one way anova followed by tukey s multiple comparison test the significance level was set at p 0 05 p 0 01 and p 0 001 3 results and discussion 3 1 cytotoxicity of halophenolic dbps by comparing the ec50 values of halophenolic dbps and baa their cytotoxicity can be ordered as follows baa tip tbp tcp 2 6 dbp 2 4 dcp 2 bp 2 cp fig 1 a different from the results that the halophenolic dbps were considered more toxic than baa on other lower organisms yang and zhang 2013 our results found that the cytotoxicity of halophenolic dbps to hepg2 cells is lower than that of baa which is similar to another study on cho cells wagner and plewa 2017 baa can inhibit glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase gapdh in cells by alkylating the sulfhydryl group of the cysteine residue at the active site leading to the inactivation of the enzyme pals et al 2013 the baa induced inhibition of gapdh activity can affect the mitochondrial metabolism dad et al 2018 consequently alterations in mitochondrial metabolism can increase the levels of ros and leading to a series of adverse effects including dna damage and cell stress dad et al 2013 to explore the possible reason for why halophenolic dbps showed less cytotoxicity than baa the activity of membrane transporters was determined as presented in fig 1b in comparison with the nc groups all pc groups showed a significant fluorescence increase indicating that mk517 inhibited abc transporters leading to calcein f accumulation inside cells on the contrary after exposure to 2 cp the fluorescence intensity decreased significantly proving that the abc transporters were activated and subsequently pumped out the intracellular calcein f and leading to the decrement of fluorescence value this result may help to explain the lower cytotoxicity of 2 cp to hepg2 cells baa 2 6 dbp and tip insignificantly changed the fluorescence indicating that these compounds have no potential to activate or inhibit abc transporters on the other hand the molecular mass of baa 2 cp 2 6 dbp and tip are 139 129 252 and 472 m z respectively it is widely believed that drugs with larger molecular mass are more challenging to enter the cell lei et al 2022 based on the results above it is hypothesized that 2 cp showed lower cytotoxicity than baa through efflux transporters while one of the reasons for 2 6 dbp and tip showed lower cytotoxicity than baa might because it is more difficult for them to enter the cells when the cytotoxicity comparison was conducted within halophenolic dbps it was found that when halophenolic dbps were substituted with the same halogen the more substitution sites the more cytotoxic which was in accordance with another study liu and zhang 2014 the most toxic chemical was tip followed by tbp and tcp when they were substituted at the same sites it was regarded that iodinated dbps are usually more cytotoxic and genotoxic than brominated dbps and are more toxic than chlorinated dbps mackeown et al 2020 the toxicities of dbps are highly relevant to their nucleophiles and the highest cytotoxicity of tip may result from its lower reactivity toward glutathione and consequently less detoxification lin and guion 1989 the dose effect curves for each halophenolic dbp are shown in fig s1 based on which ec10 to ec80 values were calculated and are presented in table s1 3 2 estrogenic and anti androgenic activities of halophenolic dbps phenolic compounds have long been considered a typical class of endocrine disrupting chemicals but the estrogenic potency and exposure risks of these halophenolic dbps are still unknown the endocrine disrupting effects of different concentrations of halophenolic dbps were measured fig s3 even at the highest concentrations the relative luciferase activities against 1 nm dht in mda kb2 cells were all below 0 5 fig s3a indicating that the ec50 values could not be obtained thus the dht equivalent factor def could not be calculated according to text s1 when co exposure with 0 1 nm e2 the relative luciferase activities against 0 1 nm e2 in mvln cells were all above 0 5 fig s3d indicating that the txf equivalent factor tef could not be calculated for the same reason conversely the relative luciferase activities against 0 1 nm e2 in mvln cells were all above 0 5 fig s3b and when co exposure with 1 nm dht the relative luciferase activities against 1 nm dht in mda kb2 cells were all below 0 5 fig s3c in this case the eef and fef can be obtained fig 2 in detail tip showed the highest eef value 4 41 10 8 which was almost 200 fold higher than that of tcp bisphenol a bpa and nonylphenol np are notorious for their estrogenic activities and the reported eef values of bpa and np were 1 8 10 5 and 1 4 10 5 respectively chen and chou 2016 so the estrogenic potency of tip was approximately 0 245 of bpa and 0 315 of np the eef value equals a measured individual compound s estrogen equivalent concentration eeq schiliro et al 2013 in one s opinion an eeq greater than 1 ng l from in vitro assays is often relevant to adverse effects on individuals in vivo jarosova et al 2014 if this assumption holds halophenolic dbps are highly unlikely to cause estrogenic activities on organisms in the aquatic environment regarding anti androgenic activity 2 4 dcp showed the highest fef value 0 4 the fef values of bpa and np were 0 36 and 2 68 respectively chen and chou 2016 so the anti androgenic activity of 2 4 dcp was approximately 111 of bpa and 14 9 of np anti androgenic activities may cause disorders of the reproductive tract infertility and testicular and prostate cancers in males hu et al 2021 in addition because androgens are the precursors of all estrogens deficiency of androgen signaling may lead to diminished fertility muscular growth disorders metabolic related diseases and bone disease in both males and females golshan and alavi 2019 overall the anti androgenic activities of some halophenolic dbps were comparable with bpa which should draw more attention 3 3 oxidative stress induced by halophenolic dbps oxidative stress is one of the crucial symptoms of toxicity induced by organic pollutants li et al 2018b halogenated phenols such as triclosan can increase intracellular ros levels and cause oxidative stress damage in mice li et al 2019 here the ros content was measured and there was no significant difference between the nc and bc groups indicating the validity of the data from this study after treatment with tcp 2 6 dbp tbp and tip the ros content in the cells was 2 16 4 23 fold higher than that in the nc group fig 3 previous studies illustrated that tbp increased ros levels and triggered lipid and protein oxidation in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells wluka et al 2020 and 2 4 dbp and tbp decreased the activity of antioxidant enzymes jarosiewicz et al 2019 excessive ros can weaken the antioxidant system and attack biological macromolecules including dna rna proteins and lipids thus triggering cell damage du et al 2020 8 ohdg is a crucial modification product that forms when ros attack the c 8 position of guanine in deoxyguanosine and guanosine causing dna damage shi et al 2012 in addition a high level of 8 ohdg is also positively correlated with genotoxicity cancer and cardiovascular disease du et al 2020 in this study all chemicals except for 2 cp and 2 bp significantly enhanced the formation of 8 ohdg against nc p 0 05 tip showed the strongest capability to induce 8 ohdg followed by tbp tcp 2 6 dbp 2 4 dcp 2 bp and 2 cp which is consistent with the ros content and cytotoxicity results the lowest cytotoxicity and unchanged ros and 8 ohdg levels after 2 cp exposure may result from the activation of the abc transporters in cells 3 4 transcriptomic response after halophenolic dbps exposure the transcriptomic profile was analyzed to identify the possible difference in multiple concentrations of these halophenolic dbps at the genetic level in this experiment the square of the biological replicates pearson correlation coefficient r2 was greater than 0 98 meeting the requirements of subsequent analysis yan et al 2013 thirty nine sequencing libraries were prepared and detailed information about the data quality is presented in table s3 principal coordinate analysis pcoa of the transcriptome indicated significant discrimination between the control group and high concentrations of halophenolic dbp treated groups fig 4 a suggesting that significant transcriptome changes occurred in detail with the decrease in the exposure concentrations the numbers of degs decreased accordingly and 1325 4766 and 23889 degs occurred after exposure to 2 cp 2 6 dbp and tip respectively at the highest exposure concentration fig s4 based on the pcoa results the following analysis and discussion mainly focused on the ec20 groups and the top 20 up down regulated degs are presented in fig 4b many degs are involved in antioxidant immune and endocrine related systems for instance the atp7a gene was significantly down regulated in all groups the cu transporting atpase atp7a participates in the transportation of cu for cu containing enzymes including sod3 or lysyl oxidase to increase their specific activity fukai and ushio fukai 2011 the decrease in atp7a gene expression contributes to impaired sod3 activity resulting in o2 overproduction and endothelial dysfunction fukai and ushio fukai 2011 thus we can explain ros accumulation in the cells and the subsequent oxidative injury the nedd4 and hspa6 genes are related to the immune system chiricosta et al 2020 guo et al 2019 the immune system is a system in balance where immunosuppression and inappropriate stimulation can lead to adverse effects holsapple et al 2018 immunosuppression may cause altered resistance to infectious diseases and neoplasia while inappropriate stimulation may result in hypersensitivity reactions autoimmunity and chronic inflammation ogungbesan et al 2019 some endocrine disrupting chemicals including bpa and phenols affect immune cell development functions and lifespan nowak et al 2019 in the present study many estrogen and androgen related genes were significantly altered proving the endocrine disrupting effects of halophenolic dbps fig 4c for instance after exposure to 2 cp 2 6 dbp and tip the ras related estrogen regulated growth inhibitor rerg gene was significantly up regulated rerg gene is a candidate tumor suppressor whose expression has been reported to be breast cancer related hanker et al 2008 the prostate transmembrane protein androgen induced 1 pmepa1 gene is an androgen inducible negative regulator of prostate cancer cell growth li et al 2008 in this study the pmepa1 gene was down regulated illustrating that halophenolic dbps may cause adverse effects on the endocrine system 3 5 identification of coexpression networks associated with halophenolic dbps exposure wgcna a systematic biology methodology is increasingly used to analyze high dimensional gene expression data langfelder and horvath 2008 the degree of gene connectivity can be applied to classify functionally correlated genes into modules clusters in an unsupervised manner that are involved in standard biological processes lian et al 2022 constructing correlation networks helps to screen key module eigengenes and identify potential biomarkers or specified pathways by associating modules with biological traits of interest niemira et al 2019 this study constructed a weighted coexpression network between degs and traits ec50 abc transporters fef eef ros and 8 ohdg to reveal the potential toxic mechanisms of halophenolic dbps after using the dynamic tree cut algorithm sixteen wgcna modules were identified and marked by different colors fig 5 a the modules in each trait with p 0 05 were selected as the candidate modules for the following analysis for instance megreen r 0 61 p 0 035 mebrown r 0 823 p 0 001 and megreenyellow r 0 951 p 2e 6 were positively related to the ec50 trait while mepink r 0 947 p 3 1e 6 memidnightblue r 0 706 p 0 01 and meturquoise r 0 785 p 0 0025 were negatively related to the ec50 trait fig 5b the potential hub gene in each candidate module was obtained by setting the gene significance over 0 2 and the module membership over 0 8 bian et al 2022 then go and kegg pathway enrichment analyses were conducted with the hub genes in each trait gene product properties can be defined by go categories classified into three domains cellular components cc molecular functions mf and biological processes bp as shown in figs s5 s7 the numbers of affected go items can be ordered as tip 2 6 dbp 2 cp which is in accordance with the cytotoxicity test the interplay between individual traits and kegg pathways is presented in fig 6 a in detail the traits of ros and 8 ohdg were highly related to the mapk signaling pathway the trait of ec50 was most associated with the mapk signaling pathway and herpes simplex virus hsv 1 infection pathway hsv is a highly contagious pathogen responsible for causing inflammatory cascades in organisms goswami et al 2018 the enrichment of hsv 1 infection pathway might reflect that the immune system was affected by halophenolic dbps the trait of fef was well connected with the mapk signaling pathway and breast cancer implying that halophenolic dbps are endocrine disrupting chemicals and can potentially cause related diseases santaliz casiano et al 2022 in the endocrine disrupting effects test halophenolic dbps were proven to be highly unlikely to cause estrogenic activities in organisms in the aquatic system correspondingly the trait of eef did not correlate with endocrine related pathways furthermore the abc transporter interplayed with the ribosome pathway which has been proven to affect the abc transporter in yeast lakshminarayan et al 2020 overall the mapk signaling pathway was the most predominant pathway associated with the potential toxic mechanism of halophenolic dbps as presented in fig 6b most degs in the mapk signaling pathway were significantly down regulated which might be responsible for the cytotoxicity and endocrine disrupting effects induced by halophenolic dbps mapks are proline targeted serine threonine kinases that cooperate with various intracellular signaling pathways in response to external stimuli and play a critical role in cellular activities such as gene expression mitosis differentiation proliferation and cell survival apoptosis cargnello and roux 2011 it has been proven that the mapk signaling pathway can be activated by ros forbes et al 2014 then the activated mapks phosphorylated transcription factors and other targets can regulate gene transcription and immune responses huang et al 2009 in addition mapk is thought to be associated with ligand independent activation of the estrogen receptor er leading to a cross talk between growth factor and er mediated signaling liu et al 2017 after exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals including bpa triclocarban and triclosan the mapk signaling pathway could be significantly affected yawer et al 2022 overall the mapk signaling pathway is the most important pathway in regulating cytotoxicity and the anti androgenic effects induced by halophenolic dbps furthermore the extracellular matrix ecm receptor interaction signaling pathway was also significantly affected after exposure to 2 cp fig s8 in addition to maintaining the structure and function of cells and tissues ecm also plays an essential role in the specific interaction between cells through proteoglycans cd36 or other components related to the cell surface maziveyi and alahari 2015 which may explain the mechanism of the activated efflux pump as shown in fig s9 at the ec20 dose for 2 6 dbp the carboxylic acid biosynthetic process pathways were significantly up regulated carboxylic acids are chemicals produced by the oxidation of primary alcohols by ros jia et al 2022 which also significantly accumulated in the present study besides other enriched pathways including protein glycosylation khoder agha and kietzmann 2021 ecm organization chittiboyina et al 2018 and ossification liu et al 2021 are also highly associated with ros accumulation in this case we can conjecture that after exposure to 2 6 dbp excessive ros were produced resulting in a series of adverse effects including cytotoxicity regarding tip except for the mapk signaling pathway discussed above the tnf signaling pathway is also significantly up regulated which plays a significant role in inflammation and immune regulation di paola et al 2004 accordingly many disease related pathways were significantly enriched including prion disease non alcoholic fatty liver disease salmonella infection pathogenic escherichia coli infection influenza a and bacterial invasion of epithelial cells fig s10 all these disease related pathways illustrated that the immune system was injured after exposure to tip and such injury may contribute to its cytotoxicity 4 conclusion this study explored the cytotoxicity of seven halophenolic dbps on human cells and found that their cytotoxicity can be ordered as follows tip tbp tcp 2 6 dbp 2 4 dcp 2 bp 2 cp it can be speculated that when halophenolic dbps were substituted with the same halogen the more substitution sites the more cytotoxic while when they were substituted at the same sites the most toxic chemical was iodophenols followed by bromophenols and chlorophenols in addition to cytotoxicity some halophenolic dbps posed anti androgenic effects on human cells the degs analysis revealed that the expression of some estrogen and androgen related genes was significantly changed causing endocrine disrupting effects furthermore all halophenolic dbps except for 2 cp and 2 bp significantly increased the levels of ros or 8 ohdg in hepg2 cells the lowest cytotoxicity and unchanged ros and 8 ohdg levels after 2 cp exposure may result from the activation of the abc transporters in cells in contrast to 2 cp excessive ros and 8 ohdg accumulated after treatment with 2 6 dbp or tip resulting in adverse effects especially for tip the immune system of hepg2 cells was harmed leading to its highest cytotoxicity by conducting wgcna we concluded that the mapk signaling pathway played a vital role in regulating the biological response after exposure to halophenolic dbps the findings of this study may provide critical evidence for the necessities of monitoring halophenolic dbps in different disinfection scenarios and highlight the

15246,halophenolic disinfection byproducts dbps are a class of emerging pollutants whose adverse effects on human cells and the underlying molecular mechanisms still need further exploration in this study we found that when halophenolic dbps were substituted with the same halogen the more substitution sites the more cytotoxic while when they were substituted at the same sites the most toxic chemical was iodophenols followed by bromophenols and chlorophenols in addition several of them exerted significant endocrine disrupting effects at sublethal concentrations 2 4 6 triiodophenol tip and 2 4 dichlorophenol 2 4 dcp showed the highest estradiol equivalent factor eef of 4 41 10 8 and flutamide equivalent factor fef of 0 4 respectively furthermore all of the halophenolic dbps except for 2 chlorophenol 2 cp and 2 bromophenol 2 bp significantly increased the levels of reactive oxygen species ros or 8 hydroxydeoxyguanosine 8 ohdg in hepg2 cells the lowest cytotoxicity and unchanged ros and 8 ohdg levels after 2 cp exposure may result from the activation of the transporters of the adenosine triphosphate atp binding cassette in cells transcriptome analysis revealed distinct grouping patterns of 2 cp 2 6 dibromophenol 2 6 dbp and tip at the concentrations of ec20 and the top differentially expressed genes degs were involved in the antioxidant immune and endocrine associated systems the weighted gene correlation network analysis well connected the phenotypes ec50 eef fef ros 8 ohdg and abc transporters with the degs and revealed that the mapk signaling pathway played a vital role in regulating the biological response after exposure to halophenolic dbps this study provides deep insights into the underlying mechanisms of the toxic effects induced by halophenolic dbps graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords halophenolic disinfection byproducts cytotoxicity endocrine disrupting effects transcriptomics wgcna data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction halophenols are important chemical products which have been serving as disinfectants pesticides herbicides and dyes for decades sumithran et al 2012 in 2013 several of them were identified as a newly emerging class of disinfection byproducts dbps that could be formed from the reaction between organic matter and chlorine disinfectants pan and zhang 2013 since then halophenolic dbps have been frequently reported in many post disinfection scenarios including drinking water swimming pool water and sewage wastewater gong and zhang 2015 xiao et al 2012 the reported concentrations of halophenolic dbps are usually at the ng l to μg l level in disinfected water and are relatively lower than those commonly detected trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas pan et al 2017 yang et al 2019 however their human health risks should not be neglected due to multiple exposure routes including drinking water inhalation skin contact and bioaccumulation shi et al 2018 a former study applied granular activated carbon to remove intermediate aromatic halogenated dbps and found it significantly reduced the developmental toxicity of chlorinated drinking water jiang et al 2017 implying the importance to investigate the toxicity of halophenolic dbps since the detection of halophenolic dbps researchers have endeavored to determine their intrinsic toxicities and compare them with other regulated dbps for instance it was found that 2 4 6 triiodophenol tip exerted higher cytotoxicity to chinese hamster ovary cho cells than all thms and most haas wagner and plewa 2017 in addition the developmental toxicity of halophenolic dbps to the marine polychaete platynereis dumerilii was higher than those of all tested haas yang and zhang 2013 similarly halophenolic dbps were reported to exert significantly higher toxicity to the alga tetraselmis marina than the commonly known haas liu and zhang 2014 in summary existing studies have primarily focused on the toxicity of partial halophenolic dbps to aquatic organisms and animal cells zhang et al 2020 although jiang 2004 explored the cytotoxicity of chlorophenols on human hepatocellular liver carcinoma hepg2 cells and leonetti et al 2018 detected the endocrine disrupting potential of bromophenols on human cells as far as we know there is no systematic report about the toxic effects such as cytotoxicity endocrine disrupting effects and oxidative stress of these halophenol dbps which have been proven in other phenolic compounds huang et al 2020 regarding the toxic mechanisms of halophenols a previous study found that 2 4 dichlorophenol 2 4 dcp decreased basal mitochondrial respiration and adenosine triphosphate atp production in fish embryos li et al 2018a the uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation may also result in the toxicity of chlorophenols to intact cells shannon et al 1991 kollitz et al 2018 found the affinity of 2 4 6 tribromophenol tbp for human thyroid receptor beta suggesting its potential to interfere with thyroid hormone metabolism and transport michalowicz et al 2022 however the underlying mechanisms of the cytotoxicity and endocrine disrupting effects of halophenolic dbps are still unclear from the genetic perspective this study aimed to systematically investigate the cytotoxicity endocrine disrupting effects and oxidative damage upon exposure to seven reported halophenolic dbps 2 chlorophenol 2 cp 2 bromophenol 2 bp 2 4 dcp 2 6 dibromophenol 2 6 dbp 2 4 6 trichlorophenol tcp tbp and tip based on a series of human cell platforms bromoacetic acid baa which belongs to haa was chosen as a typical representative of regulated dbps for comparison biomarkers in the antioxidant system including reactive oxygen species ros and 8 hydroxydeoxyguanosine 8 ohdg were determined to evaluate the oxidative stress of these pollutants transcriptome analysis a powerful tool to uncover the underlying molecular mechanisms coupled with weighted gene correlation network analysis wgcna was applied to explore the underlying toxic mechanisms of halophenolic dbps overall the findings of this study will provide fundamental information for screening the toxicity of halophenolic dbps and evaluating their potential health risk to human beings 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals 2 cp 2 bp 2 4 dcp 2 6 dbp tcp tbp tip estradiol e2 dihydrotestosterone dht flutamide flu tamoxifen txf glutamine purity 99 and dimethyl sulfoxide dmso chromatographic purity were purchased from the sigma aldrich inc and baa was purchased from the j k scientific inc 2 2 cell culture and viability test hepg2 cells were cultured in dulbecco s modified eagle s medium dmem gibco u s a with 10 fetal bovine serum fbs gibco u s a at 37 c in a humidified atmosphere of 5 co2 for cytotoxicity assessment shi et al 2015 mda kb2 cells were cultured in l 15 medium containing 1 penicillin streptomycin 1 glutamine and 10 fbs in a 90 humidified atmosphere of 100 air at 37 c to test the androgenic and anti androgenic activities the bioluminescent mce 7 derived cell line mvln was cultured in dmem containing 1 penicillin streptomycin 1 glutamine and 10 fbs in a 90 humidified atmosphere of 95 air and 5 co2 at 37 c to test the estrogenic and anti estrogenic activities the cytotoxicity of each sample was determined by a cck 8 reagent keygen china based on the hepg2 cell line all the compounds were dissolved in dmso and the working solutions were freshly diluted in dmem with 10 fbs to a final concentration of 0 1 dmso v v first approximately 5000 cells per well were seeded into a 96 well microplate and incubated for 24 h then the concentrated samples with a series of concentrations were added to each plate well for an additional 24 h incubation the negative control nc group was 0 1 dmso the positive control pc was 0 1 phenol and the blank control bc group was the fresh medium without any additional substance subsequently 10 μl of cck 8 solution was added to each well of the plate and spectrophotometric measurement of the mixture was performed with a microplate reader bio tek winooski vt u s a at a wavelength of 450 nm after incubation for 1 h the cell viability was calculated based on the absorbance to generate each sample s concentration response curve and regression analysis was applied to calculate the ec10 to ec80 values according to heger et al 2012 2 3 assessment of endocrine disrupting effects ec20 value is commonly regarded as a threshold for acute toxicity and many toxicity tests adopted them to evaluate the sub lethal effects of toxicants gao et al 2019 in this case according to the cytotoxicity results the ec20 value was applied as the highest concentration for each compound in the tests of endocrine disrupting effects first mda kb2 cells or mvln cells were seeded in 384 well plates at 1 6 104 cells per well and exposed to different concentrations of halophenolic dbps for 24 h and standard curves were included on each plate by applying serially diluted e2 dht flu or txf solutions in the assay medium at the end of exposure the plates were rinsed with phosphate buffer saline pbs keygen china twice and then 10 μl of cell lysate was added to each well after 10 min of vibration 25 µl of luciferase detection reagent was added to each well and then the fluorescence was recorded by a microplate reader bio tek winooski vt u s a protein content was used as an internal standard to calibrate the luminescence values 12 5 μl of fluorescamine 0 5 g l diluted in acetonitrile was added to each well and fluorometric measurements were conducted at 355 460 nm wavelength according to a standard curve of bovine serum albumin glibo u s a in assays the results are expressed as a ration to maximal luciferase activity induced by the pc of 0 1 nm e2 on mvln cells or 1 nm dht on mda kb2 cells respectively in addition the e2 equivalent factor eef and the flu equivalent factor fef were calculated according to eqs 1 and 2 to indicate the estrogenic and anti androgenic activities respectively more details about the quantitative methods of the endocrine disrupting effects are summarized in text s1 of the supporting information the standard curves for dht e2 flu and txf was presented in fig s2 accordingly ec50 values for dht e2 flu and txf were calculated as 0 086 0 002 2300 and 5 6 nm respectively 1 eef e c 50 e 2 e c 50 test compound 2 fef e c 50 ful e c 50 test compound 2 4 ros and 8 ohdg determination hepg2 cells were exposed to baa and seven halophenolic dbps at the ec20 values for 24 h in black wall 96 well plates after incubation the cells were washed twice with cold pbs and resuspended in pbs at 5 105 cells per milliliter then the intracellular ros and 8 ohdg contents were determined according to the instructions of the ros kit jiancheng china and human 8 ohdg elisa kit jiancheng china respectively the preparation for the nc and bc groups was the same as the cytotoxicity test the results were calibrated with protein content which have been descripted above 2 5 membrane transporter activity test active drug efflux depends on transporters of the atp binding cassette abc containing family of proteins which is an essential mechanism for preventing access of chemicals to targets nikaido 1994 we chose the activity of the abc transporter as a target to measure the influence of 2 cp 2 6 dbp tip and baa on transmembrane proteins by testing the accumulation of the cell probe calcein am cam cam is a nonfluorescent highly lipid soluble dye that can rapidly penetrate the plasma membrane of cells and be transferred to fluorescent calcein calcein f eneroth et al 2001 the exposure concentration series was set at ec20 ec20 10 ec20 100 and ec20 1000 for each test compound after exposure 0 25 μm cam was added to each well of 96 well plates with black wall after incubating and washing 2 5 μg ml hoechst 33342 abbkine u s a was added to each well for counting the number of live hepg2 cells the excitation emission wavelengths of cam were 485 530 nm the fluorescence value of cam was normalized to the number of live hepg2 cells which was determined by the fluorescence value of hoechst 33342 in the same well the pc was 50 μm of mk 571 solution the nc was 0 1 dmso and the bc was fresh medium without any additional substance 2 6 isolation of rna and sequencing 2 cp 2 6 dbp and tip were chosen for rna seq and the concentration set was the same as the membrane transporter activity test the difference was that hepg2 cells were cultured in 6 well plates the nc groups were the same as the cytotoxicity test at the end of exposure total rna was extracted with the trizol reagent invitrogen carlsbad ca u s a and purified with the qiagen rneasy minirna cleanup kit qiagen germantown md u s a three pooled replicates of rna seq by the illumina hiseqtm 2500 were applied for each experimental group 2 7 statistical analysis three replicants were performed for all tests and the results were expressed as the average avg standard deviation sd dose response curves were processed by graphpad prism version 8 3 sequencing raw data denoising was conducted by trimmomatic software version 0 36 subsequently the clean reads were mapped to the human reference genome through hisat2 version 2 0 4 with the default parameters after being scored by htseq the clean sequencing data score over 10 were processed to identify the degs through the edger package version 4 0 in r software version 4 2 1 genes with a fold change of more than 2 0 and p 0 05 were considered significant degs zhou et al 2020 the biological significance of the degs was analyzed based on the go terms and the kegg pathway database using david bioinformatics resources 6 8 https david ncifcrf gov the coexpression network was constructed using the wgcna r package langfelder and horvath 2008 comparisons between nc groups and experimental groups were performed using one way anova followed by tukey s multiple comparison test the significance level was set at p 0 05 p 0 01 and p 0 001 3 results and discussion 3 1 cytotoxicity of halophenolic dbps by comparing the ec50 values of halophenolic dbps and baa their cytotoxicity can be ordered as follows baa tip tbp tcp 2 6 dbp 2 4 dcp 2 bp 2 cp fig 1 a different from the results that the halophenolic dbps were considered more toxic than baa on other lower organisms yang and zhang 2013 our results found that the cytotoxicity of halophenolic dbps to hepg2 cells is lower than that of baa which is similar to another study on cho cells wagner and plewa 2017 baa can inhibit glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase gapdh in cells by alkylating the sulfhydryl group of the cysteine residue at the active site leading to the inactivation of the enzyme pals et al 2013 the baa induced inhibition of gapdh activity can affect the mitochondrial metabolism dad et al 2018 consequently alterations in mitochondrial metabolism can increase the levels of ros and leading to a series of adverse effects including dna damage and cell stress dad et al 2013 to explore the possible reason for why halophenolic dbps showed less cytotoxicity than baa the activity of membrane transporters was determined as presented in fig 1b in comparison with the nc groups all pc groups showed a significant fluorescence increase indicating that mk517 inhibited abc transporters leading to calcein f accumulation inside cells on the contrary after exposure to 2 cp the fluorescence intensity decreased significantly proving that the abc transporters were activated and subsequently pumped out the intracellular calcein f and leading to the decrement of fluorescence value this result may help to explain the lower cytotoxicity of 2 cp to hepg2 cells baa 2 6 dbp and tip insignificantly changed the fluorescence indicating that these compounds have no potential to activate or inhibit abc transporters on the other hand the molecular mass of baa 2 cp 2 6 dbp and tip are 139 129 252 and 472 m z respectively it is widely believed that drugs with larger molecular mass are more challenging to enter the cell lei et al 2022 based on the results above it is hypothesized that 2 cp showed lower cytotoxicity than baa through efflux transporters while one of the reasons for 2 6 dbp and tip showed lower cytotoxicity than baa might because it is more difficult for them to enter the cells when the cytotoxicity comparison was conducted within halophenolic dbps it was found that when halophenolic dbps were substituted with the same halogen the more substitution sites the more cytotoxic which was in accordance with another study liu and zhang 2014 the most toxic chemical was tip followed by tbp and tcp when they were substituted at the same sites it was regarded that iodinated dbps are usually more cytotoxic and genotoxic than brominated dbps and are more toxic than chlorinated dbps mackeown et al 2020 the toxicities of dbps are highly relevant to their nucleophiles and the highest cytotoxicity of tip may result from its lower reactivity toward glutathione and consequently less detoxification lin and guion 1989 the dose effect curves for each halophenolic dbp are shown in fig s1 based on which ec10 to ec80 values were calculated and are presented in table s1 3 2 estrogenic and anti androgenic activities of halophenolic dbps phenolic compounds have long been considered a typical class of endocrine disrupting chemicals but the estrogenic potency and exposure risks of these halophenolic dbps are still unknown the endocrine disrupting effects of different concentrations of halophenolic dbps were measured fig s3 even at the highest concentrations the relative luciferase activities against 1 nm dht in mda kb2 cells were all below 0 5 fig s3a indicating that the ec50 values could not be obtained thus the dht equivalent factor def could not be calculated according to text s1 when co exposure with 0 1 nm e2 the relative luciferase activities against 0 1 nm e2 in mvln cells were all above 0 5 fig s3d indicating that the txf equivalent factor tef could not be calculated for the same reason conversely the relative luciferase activities against 0 1 nm e2 in mvln cells were all above 0 5 fig s3b and when co exposure with 1 nm dht the relative luciferase activities against 1 nm dht in mda kb2 cells were all below 0 5 fig s3c in this case the eef and fef can be obtained fig 2 in detail tip showed the highest eef value 4 41 10 8 which was almost 200 fold higher than that of tcp bisphenol a bpa and nonylphenol np are notorious for their estrogenic activities and the reported eef values of bpa and np were 1 8 10 5 and 1 4 10 5 respectively chen and chou 2016 so the estrogenic potency of tip was approximately 0 245 of bpa and 0 315 of np the eef value equals a measured individual compound s estrogen equivalent concentration eeq schiliro et al 2013 in one s opinion an eeq greater than 1 ng l from in vitro assays is often relevant to adverse effects on individuals in vivo jarosova et al 2014 if this assumption holds halophenolic dbps are highly unlikely to cause estrogenic activities on organisms in the aquatic environment regarding anti androgenic activity 2 4 dcp showed the highest fef value 0 4 the fef values of bpa and np were 0 36 and 2 68 respectively chen and chou 2016 so the anti androgenic activity of 2 4 dcp was approximately 111 of bpa and 14 9 of np anti androgenic activities may cause disorders of the reproductive tract infertility and testicular and prostate cancers in males hu et al 2021 in addition because androgens are the precursors of all estrogens deficiency of androgen signaling may lead to diminished fertility muscular growth disorders metabolic related diseases and bone disease in both males and females golshan and alavi 2019 overall the anti androgenic activities of some halophenolic dbps were comparable with bpa which should draw more attention 3 3 oxidative stress induced by halophenolic dbps oxidative stress is one of the crucial symptoms of toxicity induced by organic pollutants li et al 2018b halogenated phenols such as triclosan can increase intracellular ros levels and cause oxidative stress damage in mice li et al 2019 here the ros content was measured and there was no significant difference between the nc and bc groups indicating the validity of the data from this study after treatment with tcp 2 6 dbp tbp and tip the ros content in the cells was 2 16 4 23 fold higher than that in the nc group fig 3 previous studies illustrated that tbp increased ros levels and triggered lipid and protein oxidation in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells wluka et al 2020 and 2 4 dbp and tbp decreased the activity of antioxidant enzymes jarosiewicz et al 2019 excessive ros can weaken the antioxidant system and attack biological macromolecules including dna rna proteins and lipids thus triggering cell damage du et al 2020 8 ohdg is a crucial modification product that forms when ros attack the c 8 position of guanine in deoxyguanosine and guanosine causing dna damage shi et al 2012 in addition a high level of 8 ohdg is also positively correlated with genotoxicity cancer and cardiovascular disease du et al 2020 in this study all chemicals except for 2 cp and 2 bp significantly enhanced the formation of 8 ohdg against nc p 0 05 tip showed the strongest capability to induce 8 ohdg followed by tbp tcp 2 6 dbp 2 4 dcp 2 bp and 2 cp which is consistent with the ros content and cytotoxicity results the lowest cytotoxicity and unchanged ros and 8 ohdg levels after 2 cp exposure may result from the activation of the abc transporters in cells 3 4 transcriptomic response after halophenolic dbps exposure the transcriptomic profile was analyzed to identify the possible difference in multiple concentrations of these halophenolic dbps at the genetic level in this experiment the square of the biological replicates pearson correlation coefficient r2 was greater than 0 98 meeting the requirements of subsequent analysis yan et al 2013 thirty nine sequencing libraries were prepared and detailed information about the data quality is presented in table s3 principal coordinate analysis pcoa of the transcriptome indicated significant discrimination between the control group and high concentrations of halophenolic dbp treated groups fig 4 a suggesting that significant transcriptome changes occurred in detail with the decrease in the exposure concentrations the numbers of degs decreased accordingly and 1325 4766 and 23889 degs occurred after exposure to 2 cp 2 6 dbp and tip respectively at the highest exposure concentration fig s4 based on the pcoa results the following analysis and discussion mainly focused on the ec20 groups and the top 20 up down regulated degs are presented in fig 4b many degs are involved in antioxidant immune and endocrine related systems for instance the atp7a gene was significantly down regulated in all groups the cu transporting atpase atp7a participates in the transportation of cu for cu containing enzymes including sod3 or lysyl oxidase to increase their specific activity fukai and ushio fukai 2011 the decrease in atp7a gene expression contributes to impaired sod3 activity resulting in o2 overproduction and endothelial dysfunction fukai and ushio fukai 2011 thus we can explain ros accumulation in the cells and the subsequent oxidative injury the nedd4 and hspa6 genes are related to the immune system chiricosta et al 2020 guo et al 2019 the immune system is a system in balance where immunosuppression and inappropriate stimulation can lead to adverse effects holsapple et al 2018 immunosuppression may cause altered resistance to infectious diseases and neoplasia while inappropriate stimulation may result in hypersensitivity reactions autoimmunity and chronic inflammation ogungbesan et al 2019 some endocrine disrupting chemicals including bpa and phenols affect immune cell development functions and lifespan nowak et al 2019 in the present study many estrogen and androgen related genes were significantly altered proving the endocrine disrupting effects of halophenolic dbps fig 4c for instance after exposure to 2 cp 2 6 dbp and tip the ras related estrogen regulated growth inhibitor rerg gene was significantly up regulated rerg gene is a candidate tumor suppressor whose expression has been reported to be breast cancer related hanker et al 2008 the prostate transmembrane protein androgen induced 1 pmepa1 gene is an androgen inducible negative regulator of prostate cancer cell growth li et al 2008 in this study the pmepa1 gene was down regulated illustrating that halophenolic dbps may cause adverse effects on the endocrine system 3 5 identification of coexpression networks associated with halophenolic dbps exposure wgcna a systematic biology methodology is increasingly used to analyze high dimensional gene expression data langfelder and horvath 2008 the degree of gene connectivity can be applied to classify functionally correlated genes into modules clusters in an unsupervised manner that are involved in standard biological processes lian et al 2022 constructing correlation networks helps to screen key module eigengenes and identify potential biomarkers or specified pathways by associating modules with biological traits of interest niemira et al 2019 this study constructed a weighted coexpression network between degs and traits ec50 abc transporters fef eef ros and 8 ohdg to reveal the potential toxic mechanisms of halophenolic dbps after using the dynamic tree cut algorithm sixteen wgcna modules were identified and marked by different colors fig 5 a the modules in each trait with p 0 05 were selected as the candidate modules for the following analysis for instance megreen r 0 61 p 0 035 mebrown r 0 823 p 0 001 and megreenyellow r 0 951 p 2e 6 were positively related to the ec50 trait while mepink r 0 947 p 3 1e 6 memidnightblue r 0 706 p 0 01 and meturquoise r 0 785 p 0 0025 were negatively related to the ec50 trait fig 5b the potential hub gene in each candidate module was obtained by setting the gene significance over 0 2 and the module membership over 0 8 bian et al 2022 then go and kegg pathway enrichment analyses were conducted with the hub genes in each trait gene product properties can be defined by go categories classified into three domains cellular components cc molecular functions mf and biological processes bp as shown in figs s5 s7 the numbers of affected go items can be ordered as tip 2 6 dbp 2 cp which is in accordance with the cytotoxicity test the interplay between individual traits and kegg pathways is presented in fig 6 a in detail the traits of ros and 8 ohdg were highly related to the mapk signaling pathway the trait of ec50 was most associated with the mapk signaling pathway and herpes simplex virus hsv 1 infection pathway hsv is a highly contagious pathogen responsible for causing inflammatory cascades in organisms goswami et al 2018 the enrichment of hsv 1 infection pathway might reflect that the immune system was affected by halophenolic dbps the trait of fef was well connected with the mapk signaling pathway and breast cancer implying that halophenolic dbps are endocrine disrupting chemicals and can potentially cause related diseases santaliz casiano et al 2022 in the endocrine disrupting effects test halophenolic dbps were proven to be highly unlikely to cause estrogenic activities in organisms in the aquatic system correspondingly the trait of eef did not correlate with endocrine related pathways furthermore the abc transporter interplayed with the ribosome pathway which has been proven to affect the abc transporter in yeast lakshminarayan et al 2020 overall the mapk signaling pathway was the most predominant pathway associated with the potential toxic mechanism of halophenolic dbps as presented in fig 6b most degs in the mapk signaling pathway were significantly down regulated which might be responsible for the cytotoxicity and endocrine disrupting effects induced by halophenolic dbps mapks are proline targeted serine threonine kinases that cooperate with various intracellular signaling pathways in response to external stimuli and play a critical role in cellular activities such as gene expression mitosis differentiation proliferation and cell survival apoptosis cargnello and roux 2011 it has been proven that the mapk signaling pathway can be activated by ros forbes et al 2014 then the activated mapks phosphorylated transcription factors and other targets can regulate gene transcription and immune responses huang et al 2009 in addition mapk is thought to be associated with ligand independent activation of the estrogen receptor er leading to a cross talk between growth factor and er mediated signaling liu et al 2017 after exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals including bpa triclocarban and triclosan the mapk signaling pathway could be significantly affected yawer et al 2022 overall the mapk signaling pathway is the most important pathway in regulating cytotoxicity and the anti androgenic effects induced by halophenolic dbps furthermore the extracellular matrix ecm receptor interaction signaling pathway was also significantly affected after exposure to 2 cp fig s8 in addition to maintaining the structure and function of cells and tissues ecm also plays an essential role in the specific interaction between cells through proteoglycans cd36 or other components related to the cell surface maziveyi and alahari 2015 which may explain the mechanism of the activated efflux pump as shown in fig s9 at the ec20 dose for 2 6 dbp the carboxylic acid biosynthetic process pathways were significantly up regulated carboxylic acids are chemicals produced by the oxidation of primary alcohols by ros jia et al 2022 which also significantly accumulated in the present study besides other enriched pathways including protein glycosylation khoder agha and kietzmann 2021 ecm organization chittiboyina et al 2018 and ossification liu et al 2021 are also highly associated with ros accumulation in this case we can conjecture that after exposure to 2 6 dbp excessive ros were produced resulting in a series of adverse effects including cytotoxicity regarding tip except for the mapk signaling pathway discussed above the tnf signaling pathway is also significantly up regulated which plays a significant role in inflammation and immune regulation di paola et al 2004 accordingly many disease related pathways were significantly enriched including prion disease non alcoholic fatty liver disease salmonella infection pathogenic escherichia coli infection influenza a and bacterial invasion of epithelial cells fig s10 all these disease related pathways illustrated that the immune system was injured after exposure to tip and such injury may contribute to its cytotoxicity 4 conclusion this study explored the cytotoxicity of seven halophenolic dbps on human cells and found that their cytotoxicity can be ordered as follows tip tbp tcp 2 6 dbp 2 4 dcp 2 bp 2 cp it can be speculated that when halophenolic dbps were substituted with the same halogen the more substitution sites the more cytotoxic while when they were substituted at the same sites the most toxic chemical was iodophenols followed by bromophenols and chlorophenols in addition to cytotoxicity some halophenolic dbps posed anti androgenic effects on human cells the degs analysis revealed that the expression of some estrogen and androgen related genes was significantly changed causing endocrine disrupting effects furthermore all halophenolic dbps except for 2 cp and 2 bp significantly increased the levels of ros or 8 ohdg in hepg2 cells the lowest cytotoxicity and unchanged ros and 8 ohdg levels after 2 cp exposure may result from the activation of the abc transporters in cells in contrast to 2 cp excessive ros and 8 ohdg accumulated after treatment with 2 6 dbp or tip resulting in adverse effects especially for tip the immune system of hepg2 cells was harmed leading to its highest cytotoxicity by conducting wgcna we concluded that the mapk signaling pathway played a vital role in regulating the biological response after exposure to halophenolic dbps the findings of this study may provide critical evidence for the necessities of monitoring halophenolic dbps in different disinfection scenarios and highlight the

15247,sulfate radical so4 based advanced oxidation is considered as a promising pretreatment strategy to degrade organic pollutants and thereby mitigate the membrane fouling in the membrane process in this study heat activated persulfate ps activation was integrated with the membrane distillation md process for the alleviation of membrane fouling in treatment of wastewater treatment plant wwtp secondary effluent and surface water in depth understanding of the molecular fate during membrane fouling control process was performed by using a non targeted screening method of two dimensional gas chromatography time of flight mass spectrometry gc gc tof ms coupling with multiple characterizations it was found that the heat activated ps activation pretreatment could effectively degrade the dissolved organic matter dom and change its molecular conformation wherein the relative abundance of oxygen containing substances was remarkably increased through oxygenation reactions moreover the refractory organics with higher molecular weight mw and unsaturation degree were more inclined to be destroyed following by partial mineralization during pretreatment process it was also identified that oxygen deficient compounds and the molecular formulas featuring higher double bond equivalent dbe values and lower mw tended to be deposited on the membrane surface to cause the membrane fouling in particular the aliphatic substances were the predominant components irrespective of membrane foulant samples from secondary effluent or surface water meanwhile the complexation between organic compounds and high valence cations as well as the precipitation of inorganics were restrained owing to the reduction of dom concentration and the transformation of molecular structure consequently leading to reduced membrane fouling this study is believed to further provide new insight into the membrane fouling control mechanism at molecular level graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords membrane distillation heat activated persulfate ps pretreatment membrane fouling dissolved organic matter gc gc tof ms 1 introduction membrane distillation md as an emerging membrane technology holds great promise in the application of desalination recovery of valuable components and water purification owing to its advantages of less requirements for membrane mechanical strength and excellent separation efficiency chen et al 2020 huang et al 2017 liu et al 2021 different from traditional pressure driven membrane processes md is driven by the vapor pressure difference triggered by the temperature gradient between the two sides of the hydrophobic microporous membrane wherein the water vapor from the hot feed transports through the membrane pores and is condensed in the cold permeate side gao et al 2019 qtaishat et al 2008 however membrane fouling caused by the deposition and attachment of contaminants on the hydrophobic membrane surface and within the pores remains a significant problem contributing to the reduction of water flux and deterioration of water quality thereby increasing the cost of water treatment and restricting its industrial applications alkhatib et al 2021 boo et al 2018 consequently it is imperative to develop an effective and robust strategy to control the membrane fouling in md pretreatment prior to the membrane process is considered as one of the effective ways for the alleviation of the membrane fouling by altering the biological and or physicochemical characters of the feed solution tijing et al 2015 to date several methods including coagulation precipitation zheng et al 2020 membrane filtration gao et al 2011 adjustment of ph yu et al 2018 sonication hou et al 2016 and pre oxidation guo et al 2020 were employed as pretreatment methods for the water treatment and or desalination in recent years the sulfate radical so4 based advanced oxidation process by persulfate ps activation has gained extensive attention for reducing contaminants in surface waste water due to the superior oxidation capacity of so4 in a wide range of ph conditions asif et al 2021 duan et al 2015 it has been reported that there are various ways such as ultraviolet irradiation transition metal ions heterogeneous catalysts and heating were used for the activation of ps to oxidize organic matter in wastewater and alleviate membrane fouling guo et al 2021 han et al 2022 thereinto heating activation shows great potential as the pretreatment prior to md process ascribed to the following reasons i effective degradation of micropollutants and organic foulants ii no demands of additional heating source for persulfate activation as md is a thermally driven process and iii free of secondary pollution because no extra chemical activators are required to be induced alkhatib et al 2021 asif et al 2019 previous studies demonstrated that the factors concerning membrane fouling are complicated including particular matters dissolved organic matter dom inorganic substances as well as microorganisms gao et al 2020 liu et al 2020 wong et al 2021 in general dom is recognized as one of the main culprits for the flux decline because it ubiquitously exists in real waters wherein the characteristics of the organic components have great impact on the fouling formation process through the special interaction with membranes fan et al 2001 gryta et al 2001 naidu et al 2014 for examples tan et al tan et al 2016 demonstrated that a concave interface would be formed by the deposition of humic acid ha on the md membrane surface leading to a 25 63 flux decline through the kelvin effect naidu et al 2014 found alginate acid contributed to minimal fouling compared to ha and bovine serum albumin bsa mainly due to its higher hydrophilicity and the negative electrostatic repulsion however the component of dom in the real context such as surface water ground water wastewater etc composing of polyhydroxyaromatics aliphatics polysaccharides proteins acidic hydrocarbons and micro pollutants is extremely complicated retarding the in depth cognition of fouling mechanism and the development of effective fouling controlling strategy fang et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 this is further complicated when in the heat activated ps pretreatment integrated membrane process as ps activation would change the dom characteristics by partially oxidizing the organic chemicals and transforming them into multifarious intermediate products and co2 further changing the membrane fouling process asif et al found that the ps activation at the md operation temperature would effectively degrade the micropollutants featuring strong electron donating functional groups and achieve 80 removal of total organic carbon thereby alleviating the membrane fouling asif et al 2021 however little is known with reference to the molecular transformation of complex dom during the heat activated ps pretreatment and its influences on the membrane fouling at the molecular level in the md process hence the md system integrated with heat activated ps pretreatment was conducted to synergistically remove the dom and alleviate membrane fouling in treatment of real surface water and secondary treated effluent the non targeted screening method of two dimensional gas chromatography time of flight mass spectrometry gc gc tof ms were used in this study in an attempt to better understand the transformation and migration of organics during the membrane fouling control process the influence of ps concentration and temperature on the dom removal and membrane fouling behavior were comprehensively evaluated wherein the variation of the molecular formulas in dom by pretreatment was analyzed by gc gc tof ms further the distribution of the molecular components and the physico chemical property of the membrane fouling were identified by the combination of various characterization this study is anticipated to offer some new perspectives for the membrane fouling mechanism and control strategies 2 materials and methods 2 1 source water and reagents the secondary effluent and surface water samples were collected from the qiaobei wastewater treatment plant wwtp in nanjing jiangsu province china and qingliu river in chuzhou anhui province china respectively the primary water quality was listed in table s1 supporting information si before the ps activation and md experiment the raw water samples were filtered using the 0 45 μm polyethersulfone filter to remove suspended particles and colloids and then stored under 4 c polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe flat sheet membranes with the average pore size thickness and porosity of 0 22 μm 100 μm and 70 respectively were purchased from wanda filter material company haining china analytical grade sodium peroxydisulfate ps na2s2o8 98 purity and thiosulphate pentahydrate na2s2o3 5h2o 99 purity were bought from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd beijing china prior to usage ps powder was dissolved into deionized water to prepare the stock solution with the concentration of 100 mm and then stored under 4 c 2 2 heat activated ps pretreatment the heat activated ps pretreatments were performed in a 3 l glass reactor under continuous stirring at a certain temperature the reaction temperature was maintained using a thermoplastic water bath equipped with the constant temperature control device in a typical experiment the volume of the reaction solution was 2 l and a certain amount of ps was added into it to initiate the catalytic process the oxidation pretreatment experiments lasted for a period of 60 min and samples were retrieved at a certain time intervals for further analysis after the reaction a stoichiometric amount of na2s2o3 5h2o was added into the solution to quench the residual oxidants for the md process in this study the concentrations of ps were set to be 0 0 2 0 4 and 0 8 mm respectively and the activation temperature ranged from 60 to 90 c all experiments were carried out in triplicate for the repeatability 2 3 dcmd test a bench scale direct contact membrane distillation dcmd system was installed in this study and shown in fig s1 the dcmd system was composed of a feed tank with the volume of 2 l membrane module distillate tank with the volume of 2 l temperature recorder and two peristaltic pumps dlpump550 kamoer china the heating and cooling were achieved by thermostat water bath and chiller respectively the membrane module was made using polymethyl methacrylate with an effective membrane area of 55 cm2 typically the dcmd was operated in a countercurrent mod and the flow rate was set to 6 16 cm s for both feed and permeate side the feed inlet temperature was maintained the same as the reaction temperature of the heat activated ps pretreatments i e 60 70 80 and 90 c while the permeate inlet temperature was kept constant at 10 c during the test the real time weight change of the permeate tank was recorded using a digital balance auy120 shimadzu china after the dcmd test the used membranes were air dried in a desiccator for further characterization the fouled membranes were labeled as mqb n m and mql n m for that related to qiaobei wwtp and qingliu river respectively where n and m represents the concentration of ps and operation temperature respectively 2 4 analysis the nontargeted screening method of two dimensional gas chromatography time of flight mass spectrometry gc gc tof ms ggt620 guangzhou hexin instrument co ltd china system was employed to analyze the molecular components in water samples and membrane fouling noticeably the fouled membranes were subjected to the sonication at 20 c for 3 h to obtain the extracts membrane foulants for further analysis the uv254 was analyzed using an uv visible spectrometer 1780 shimadzu china at the wavelength of 254 nm total organic carbon analyzer multi n c 2100 jena germany was employed to determine the total organic carbon toc the morphology the fouling layer were detected by field emission scanning electron microscope fesem zeiss merlin gemini 2 germany attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared atr ftir perkin elmer spectrum 2000 american was used to analyze the chemical functional group on the membrane surface within the wave number ranging from 4000 to 100 cm 1 in order to evaluate the hydrophilicity the static water contact angles of membrane samples were examined using the drop shape analyzer cam200 attension finland the reactive species generated during the pms activation process were detected by the electron spin resonance esr spectra emxplus 6 1 bruker germany quenching tests were performed to investigate the dominant radicals responsible for the degradation of dom wherein ethanol etoh was used as scavenger for so4 and oh and tert butyl alcohol tba was used as the scavenger for oh 3 results and discussion 3 1 organics removal by heat activated ps pretreatment the typical indexes of dissolving organic matter dom in water samples including uv254 and toc were monitored to evaluate the organics removal performance by the heat activated ps pretreatment before the ps activation the initial uv254 concentration for qiaobei wwtp and qingliu river were 0 097 and 0 102 cm 1 respectively and the corresponding toc concentration were 6 44 and 9 78 mg l respectively table s1 the effect of the ps concentration was firstly investigated by controlling the reaction temperature at 80 c and the results are shown in fig 1 it is clear that negligible amount of uv254 and toc were removed without the addition of ps implying that organics can hardly be eliminated with the heating alone for both two water samples after the induction of ps into raw water the removal efficiency of uv254 and toc showed a positive correlation with the concentration of ps with the ps concentration increasing from 0 2 to 0 8 mm the uv254 removal at 60 min increased from 25 9 to 62 0 and 26 5 to 68 6 for the raw water in qiaobei wwtp and qingliu river respectively the final toc removal for qiaobei wwtp and qingliu river increased from 16 2 to 40 7 and 11 3 to 37 0 respectively it is worth noting that the removal rate of toc was generally lower than that of uv254 this is mainly because large dom tended to be partially degraded into smaller organic molecules rather than complete mineralization into co2 and h2o guan et al 2017 suva254 parameter defined as the ratio of uv absorbance and organic carbon content is generally applied to describe the aromaticity and hydrophobicity of dom filloux et al 2012 compared with raw water suva254 values were strikingly decreased after pretreatment table s2 implying the efficient isolation or elimination of hydrophobic fractions and aromatic structures kim et al 2008 zarebska et al 2004 additionally limited improvement in organics removal was observed when the ps concentration was further increased from 0 4 to 0 8 mm suggesting that 0 4 mm was the optimized ps concentration for the degradation of raw water therefore the ps concentration of 0 4 mm was adopted for the further experiments to investigate the influence of reaction temperature fig 2 shows the effect of temperature on the degradation performance of uv254 and toc by ps activation within the temperature range of 60 90 c similar trend was observed for both water samples in qiaobei wwtp and qingliu river at the reaction temperature below 70 c heat activated ps pretreatment only triggered small removal of uv254 and toc 20 in general when the temperature was increased to 80 and 90 c both uv254 and toc removal exhibited a pronounced improvement to over 55 for uv254 and over 32 for toc these results illustrate that heat activated ps treatment can exert appreciable degradation efficiency on the organic pollutants regardless of the diversity of water quality the lower values of toc removal than that of uv254 at different temperature further verified that partial degradation of doms and considerable organic intermediates were generated in the ps oxidation process moreover the suva254 values gradually decreased with the increasing temperature demonstrating that higher temperature facilitated the degradation of hydrophobic organics which would benefit the alleviation of membrane fouling furthermore epr analysis was performed to in situ identify the free radicals as seen from fig s2a the characteristic peaks of dmpo oh adducts αh 14 8 αn 14 8 and dmpo so4 adducts αh 0 78 αh 1 48 αh 9 6 and αn 13 2 were presented in the epr spectrum confirming both so4 and oh were generated in the pretreatment process notably the characteristic signals of radicals gradually intensified with the increase of temperature which suggests that the reaction temperature exhibited a positive effect on the production of free radical at the same time the results of quenching test reveals that both so4 and oh gave rise to the degradation of organics while so4 were the main radicals responsible for the dom removal fig s2b 3 2 transformation of the molecular components of dom by heat activated ps pretreatment to further investigate the changes of molecular formulas of dom after the heat activated ps pretreatment the water samples related to qiaobei wwtp were analyzed by gc gc tof ms measurement with ei source for the non targeted screening of molecular structure information as can be seen from fig s3 a total of 749 organic compounds were identified in the raw water sample these compounds could be further classified into 6 categories according to the element composition containing cho ch chno chn chos chnos and others wherein cho compounds were denoted as the molecules only containing c h and o elements and so on among them cho compounds occupied the highest proportion with 42 9 for intensity and 43 2 for numbers this is contributed to considerable presence of carboxylic acids ester polar alcohols aldehydes ketones etc wherein the proportion of butyl 9 12 octadecadienoate c22h40o2 was up to 24 8 in intensity ch compounds were mainly composed of low polarity and nonpolar substances such as alkanes alkenes and aromatic hydrocarbons dominating the proportion of 34 3 and 28 5 in terms of peak intensities and numbers respectively besides the relative abundance of chno components ranked the third among the dom primarily derived from amino acids and nitro compounds the comparison of the change in the molecular formulas of dom at various ps concentration is shown in fig 3 a in the absence of the ps there was little change in the relative abundance of organic compounds in accordance with the results of uv254 and toc analysis when the ps concentration was increased from 0 2 to 0 4 mm the chemical diversity and relative intensity of molecular components in the dom were prominently diminished by the oxidation in which the molecules only containing cho and ch components were still the most abundant it is speculated that the reaction of oxygen addition was the common reaction during the pretreatment process as the relative abundance of oxygen containing substances were obviously increased jeong et al 2014 on the contrary the oxygen deficient substances were freely consumed especially unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbons aromatic hydrocarbon and alkane through addition reaction to the unsaturated bonds e g c c electron transfer and hydrogen abstraction by free radicals padmaja et al 1993 varanasi et al 2018 wojnarovits and takacs 2019 in addition unequable changes on the relative abundance of chno chn and chos chnos formulas were detected illustrating that multiple reactions including addition reaction substitute reaction and deamination occurred among them which contributed to the heterogeneous transformation of molecular structure varanasi et al 2018 the molecular weight distribution shows that the organic components with significant intensities were mostly concentrated in the range of 100 400 mw after the ps oxidation pretreatment fig s6 and table s3 by contrast with the raw water the distinct decline in the intensity weighed average molecular weight mww was noted in cho ch and chn compounds which confirmed the transformation of these components with higher mw to smaller molecules in dom fig 3b illustrates the influence of temperature on the molecular structure in dom by the pretreatment with the temperature increasing from 60 c to 80 c the proportion of the predominant cho compounds decreased from 63 4 to 44 7 and 45 7 to 41 7 for the peak intensities and numbers respectively which was mainly resulted from the considerable depletion of short chain aldehydes and phenols however when the temperature further increased to 90 c the content of cho compounds unexpectedly became higher probably due to the transformation of nitrogenous organic compounds such as amide nitrile and so on into cho compounds through addition reaction and or oxidative deamination zhang et al 2021 which could be confirmed by the decrease of the contents of chn and chno compounds as well as the increase of mww value of cho compounds besides other molecular components in dom were sensitive to the temperature changes and their internal structures were destructed in different ways song et al 2022 zhang et al 2019 as a result the mww of dom reduced first and then increased with the rising of temperature with the minimum of 299 38 da for the temperature of 80 c fig s6 and table s3 double bond equivalent dbe is another parameter describing the unsaturation degree of the component in dom which is calculated by the following equation fu et al 2022 koch and dittmar 2006 wan et al 2020 dbe 2 c 2 h n x 2 where c is the number of carbon atoms h is the number hydrogen atoms n is the number of nitrogen atoms and x is the number of halogen atoms as shown in fig s7 and s8 the precursors involving in the oxidation process featured higher carbon atom numbers and dbe values whereas the products exhibited the opposite tendency after pretreatment this manifests that the refractory organics with higher mw and unsaturation degree were effectively destroyed ascribed to the cleavage of cc bonds or aliphatic rings instead of co bonds in compounds which agrees well with the aforementioned results 3 3 effects of heat activated ps pretreatment on membrane fouling the normalized flux j j0 was employed to depict the membrane fouling rate during the md process fig 4 shows the flux changed with time at different ps concentration and temperature obviously the membrane fouling was effectively mitigated by the heat activated ps pretreatment in the absence of heat activated ps pretreatment the md performance could be approximately divided into two stages in the initial periods rapid flux declines were observed for both qiaobei wwtp and qingliu river sampling solutions which was mainly because the higher concentration of dom accelerated the attachment of foulants on the membrane surface in later periods the normalized flux became steady and maintained at a relatively low level suggesting the complete formation of fouling layer the lower j j0 value of qingliu river sampling solution after 12 h operation was probably associated with its higher content of organic matters after the pretreatment by ps activation at 80 c the flux curves tended to be smoothly and the final j j0 values were significantly improved to high level which was more apparent with the higher ps concentration however for qingliu river sample higher dose of ps at 0 8 mm has little improvement when compared with the ps concentration of 0 4 mm moreover the flux curves of water samples with and without the pretreatment exhibited distinct difference at two stages which could be ascribed to the variation of organic compounds during pretreatment fig 4 b and d demonstrates the influence of operation temperature on the flux change at the ps concentration of 0 4 mm it can be seen that the diminishing rate of the normalized flux gradually slowed down with the temperature increasing from 60 to 80 c wherein the final j j0 values increased from 0 59 to 0 74 for qiaobei wwtp sampling solutions while 0 54 to 0 73 for qingliu river sampling solutions unexpectedly a faster flux decline occurred when the operation temperature was further increased to 90 c and the final j j0 values dropped by 7 and 26 compared to that of 80 c for qiaobei wwtp and qingliu river samples respectively this was probably caused by the following reasons christie et al 2022 liu et al 2022 yan et al 2017 i faster concentrating rate of contaminants under higher feed temperature would boost the deposition of dom and the crystallization of inorganic salts on the membrane surface ii the driven force under higher feed temperature was stronger which could favor the formation of fouling layer with more compact structure thus leading to the hinderance on the transport of water vapor additionally it is worth noting that the contaminants were almost completely removed after the md operation with and without pretreatment table s4 3 4 mechanism of membrane fouling 3 4 1 molecular components on the membrane fouling the molecular components of extracts from fouled membrane were analyzed to evaluate the fouling potential of dom before and after pretreatment it can be seen from fig 5 that significant difference in the molecular components were recorded between the deposited foulants and feed solution while the chemical compounds containing oxygen element was dominated in the feed solution the relative intensity of the oxygen deficient compounds was remarkably increased in the fouled membrane for the samples related to qiaobei wwtp the ch compounds with the relative intensity over 50 were mainly responsible for the membrane fouling in both mqb 0 80 and mqb 0 4 80 which was probably ascribed to their hydrophobic characteristic thus resulting in the membrane binding affinity through hydrophobic interactions as for the samples associated with qingliu river cho compounds were the primary components in the membrane foulants despite small decrease of their relative intensities from 40 2 and 46 8 for ql 0 80 and ql 0 4 80 to 35 5 and 43 2 for mql 0 80 and mql 0 4 80 respectively it was noting that the relative intensity of ch compounds was still enriched in the membrane fouling regardless of their low content in the qingliu river in alignment with qiaobei wwtp fig 6 shows that the molecular weight distribution of most organic substances in membrane foulants was left shift comparing with those in the relative feed solution samples indicating that the compounds with lower mw were more inclined to be adsorbed on the membrane surface the molecular weight distribution in all samples from membrane foulants followed the similar trend in which the most fractions were within the mw ranges of 0 300 200 300 100 300 and 300 400 for cho chn chno and chos chnos components respectively it is noteworthy that the small molecules would be considerably generated by the heat activated ps pretreatment which is adverse to the alleviation of membrane fouling to some extent this suggests that the molecular weight of organics is not the major factor affecting the development of membrane fouling in addition it was observed that the membrane foulants were rich in the chemical compounds featuring higher dbe values fig s8 and s9 illustrating the unsaturation components played an essential role in membrane fouling based on the analysis in section 3 1 and 3 2 the heat activated ps pretreatment could effectively change the molecular components in dom wherein the oxygen containing substances were significantly enriched and the organics with higher unsaturation degree were destroyed leading to the reduction in both uv254 and toc these results manifest that the heat activated ps pretreatment would effectively mitigate the membrane fouling not only relying on the diminishment of the amount of the organics but also the variation of the molecular conformation in dom to further understand the membrane fouling mechanism the identified substances were further classified into 3 categories such as alicyclics aliphatics and aromatics according to the carbon skeletons and 22 subcategories in terms of the functional groups i e alcohols aldehydes ketones esters ethers carboxylic acids heterocycles alicyclic hydrocarbons halohydrocarbons amides amines nitriles hydrazines nitro compounds sulfurous acid esters sulphones thiones acyl chlorides phenols thioethers thiols and thiones the heat map in fig 7 demonstrates the relative abundances of most chemical compounds in the raw water were greatly diminished by heat activated ps pretreatment which would benefit the mitigation of membrane fouling irrespective of the significant discrepancies in organic substances of the feed solution from qiaobei wwtp and qingliu river before and after pretreatment membrane foulants were mainly concentrated in the aliphatics classification which may be due to that the chain compounds possess lower surface tension having higher tendency attaching on the membrane surface via adsorption boo et al 2018 furthermore all membrane fouling samples shared 7 most abundant subcategory species including 5 aliphatics i e halohydrocarbons amides nitriles alcohols and unsaturated hydrocarbons 1 alicyclic substance i e heterocycles and 1 aromatic substance i e ester specifically alkanes presented the highest relative abundance in mqb 0 80 and mqb 0 4 80 which is mainly resulted from the spontaneous adsorption through hydrophobic hydrophobic short range interaction on the membrane surface yu et al 2021 density functional theory dft was employed to further investigate the interaction between the common compounds with high abundance and ptfe membrane as can be seen from fig s10 the bule zone in the isosurface represents the strong attraction i e hydrogen bonding while the greener isosurface is regarded as the van der waals interaction with weak intensity obviously the van der waals interaction was the predominant attraction contributing to the deposition of contaminants on membrane surface it is also worth mentioning that the relative abundance of several other species i e halohydrocarbons in alicyclics and aromatics ethers aldehydes carboxylic acids etc were lower in membrane foulants compared with that in feed solution suggesting that these compounds were not liable to interact with membrane surface to form membrane fouling due to the higher hydrophilicity and or electrostatic repulsion 3 4 2 characterization of fouled md membranes to further gain insights into the fouling propensity the morphologies of the pristine and fouled membrane were characterized by sem fig 8 a b displays that the pristine ptfe membrane was consisted of the loose packed support layer and the thinner active layer featuring typical fiber nodule microporous structure for raw qingliu river water after the md test with for 12 h a dense thick foulant layer was observed on the membrane surface with the thickness of 7 10 μm fig 3c d as a comparison the deposition of foulants on the membrane was significantly reduced by the heat activated ps pretreatment wherein most of the reticular structure of ptfe membrane could be visibly distinguished as for the raw water of qiaobei wwtp a distinguishing surface topology was observed fig s11 the rock like pollutant foulant particles were closely stacked on the membrane surface forming a rather milder fouling layer compared to that of qingliu river which was likely due to the lower concentration of dom and salinity after pretreatment the size of the agglomerating foulants was remarkably smaller than that of raw water which might because the heat activated ps pretreatment restrain the complexation between high valence cations and organics ge et al 2014 facilitating the transport of water vapors sem eds analysis was carried out to investigate the element distribution in the fouling layer and the results were shown in fig s12 17 it is revealed that besides f mainly deriving from the pristine ptfe membrane other elements including c o s cl ca mg si and fe were also found in the fouling layers wherein c o and ca elements were dominate components suggesting the combined effect of organic deposition and calcium scaling on the membrane surface during md process which was consistent with the previous reports li et al 2016 liu et al 2017 however the comparison of eds spectrum indicates that the abundance of all fouling elements was significantly decreased with the filtration of pretreated water illustrating that the ps oxidation pretreatment could synchronously degrade the organic pollutants and restrain the inorganic precipitation thus leading to reduced membrane fouling the variation of the functional groups of membrane surface after md filtration was evaluated by ftir spectra as displayed in fig 9 the pristine ptfe membrane exhibited three characteristic peaks centering at 1200 cm 1 1140 cm 1and 627 cm 1 respectively corresponding to the stretching vibration of cf2 groups liu et al 2018 by contrast the intensity of these three transmittance bands was obviously decreased when the membranes were fouled by raw water qiaobei wtp and qingliu river sampling solutions which was mainly owing to the coverage of considerable contaminants meanwhile new peaks appeared at around 870 cm 1 1401 cm 1 and 3234 cm 1 for the mqb 0 80 and mql 0 80 the peak located at 870 cm 1 corresponded to the co coc bonds or c h bending in polysaccharides fu et al 1999 zhao et al 2009 the peaks among 3000 3500 cm 1 could be attributed to the n h bond stretching mode of amide groups whereas the broad character was probably due to the presence of carboxylate or carbohydrate belfer et al 2000 the band peaks at 1440 cm 1 and 2987 cm 1 in mqb 0 4 80 were assigned to the ch bending vibration of alkanes and amide iii bonds or stretching of the side chain coo in proteins respectively li et al 2016 the small peak at the wave number of and 1097 cm 1 in mql 0 4 80 was ascribed to the co vibration deriving from carbohydrates after pretreatment the related peaks of organics on the membrane surface were obviously weakened or disappeared while the peaks deriving from ptfe membrane became stronger confirming the alleviation of membrane fouling notably there existed blue shift of the characteristic peak and change of the peak shape after the pretreatment which maybe ascribed to the variation of the organic conformation liu et al 2018 the surface hydrophobicity was assessed through contact angle to further investigated to influence of heat activated ps pretreatment on the membrane fouling it can be seen from fig s18 that the membranes treated by using raw water as feed solution became more hydrophilic contact angles were 61 6 and 114 4 for qingliu river and qiaobei wwtp samples respectively than pristine membrane contact angles was 161 1 implying the deposition of the contaminants with hydrophilic groups comparatively the contact angles were elevated to varying degrees for the membranes fouled by pretreated raw water which was likely because that a certain amount of the foulants were degraded by ps activation and the membrane surfaces were partially exposed contributing to the improvement of hydrophobicity 4 conclusions in this study the effects of the heat activated ps pretreatment on the dom removal and md membrane fouling control in treating real secondary effluent and surface water was systematically investigated the membrane fouling in the md process could be effectively mitigated by the heat activated ps pretreatment wherein the ps concentration of 0 4 mm and temperature of 80 c was the optimum condition in this study for pretreating raw water from qiaobei wwtp and qiangliu river in terms of contaminants removal and flux decline rate comprehensive characterization of raw water and fouled membranes reveals the membrane fouling control process at molecular level with key findings as listed below 1 dom in secondary effluent qiaobei wwtp and surface water qiangliu river were subjected to the structural transformation and mineralization with the highest toc removal of 40 7 and 37 0 respectively at the ps concentration of 0 8 mm and temperature of 80 c within 60 min based on the gc gc tof ms analysis the oxygen addition was the most frequently detected reaction during the pretreatment as the relative abundance of oxygen containing substances were remarkably increased the precursors involving in the ps activation process possessed higher molecular weight and dbe values whereas the products exhibited the opposite tendency after pretreatment in this way the refractory organics with higher mw and unsaturation degree were effectively destroyed by heat activated ps pretreatment 2 heat activated ps pretreatment controlled the md membrane fouling through four ways i reducing the dom concentration ii changing the molecular conformation iii restraining the complexation between high valence cations and organics and iv hampering the precipitation of inorganics thereinto aliphatics were mainly responsible for the membrane fouling at the same time all membrane foulant samples from qiaobei wwtp and qiangliu river shared 7 species with highest abundance including 5 aliphatics halohydrocarbons amides nitriles alcohols and unsaturated hydrocarbons 1 alicyclic substance i e heterocycles and 1 aromatic substance i e ester wherein the van der waals interaction was the primary attraction between these contaminants with membrane moreover the organics with higher dbe values and lower mw preferred to be deposited on the membrane surface and cause membrane fouling declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

15247,sulfate radical so4 based advanced oxidation is considered as a promising pretreatment strategy to degrade organic pollutants and thereby mitigate the membrane fouling in the membrane process in this study heat activated persulfate ps activation was integrated with the membrane distillation md process for the alleviation of membrane fouling in treatment of wastewater treatment plant wwtp secondary effluent and surface water in depth understanding of the molecular fate during membrane fouling control process was performed by using a non targeted screening method of two dimensional gas chromatography time of flight mass spectrometry gc gc tof ms coupling with multiple characterizations it was found that the heat activated ps activation pretreatment could effectively degrade the dissolved organic matter dom and change its molecular conformation wherein the relative abundance of oxygen containing substances was remarkably increased through oxygenation reactions moreover the refractory organics with higher molecular weight mw and unsaturation degree were more inclined to be destroyed following by partial mineralization during pretreatment process it was also identified that oxygen deficient compounds and the molecular formulas featuring higher double bond equivalent dbe values and lower mw tended to be deposited on the membrane surface to cause the membrane fouling in particular the aliphatic substances were the predominant components irrespective of membrane foulant samples from secondary effluent or surface water meanwhile the complexation between organic compounds and high valence cations as well as the precipitation of inorganics were restrained owing to the reduction of dom concentration and the transformation of molecular structure consequently leading to reduced membrane fouling this study is believed to further provide new insight into the membrane fouling control mechanism at molecular level graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords membrane distillation heat activated persulfate ps pretreatment membrane fouling dissolved organic matter gc gc tof ms 1 introduction membrane distillation md as an emerging membrane technology holds great promise in the application of desalination recovery of valuable components and water purification owing to its advantages of less requirements for membrane mechanical strength and excellent separation efficiency chen et al 2020 huang et al 2017 liu et al 2021 different from traditional pressure driven membrane processes md is driven by the vapor pressure difference triggered by the temperature gradient between the two sides of the hydrophobic microporous membrane wherein the water vapor from the hot feed transports through the membrane pores and is condensed in the cold permeate side gao et al 2019 qtaishat et al 2008 however membrane fouling caused by the deposition and attachment of contaminants on the hydrophobic membrane surface and within the pores remains a significant problem contributing to the reduction of water flux and deterioration of water quality thereby increasing the cost of water treatment and restricting its industrial applications alkhatib et al 2021 boo et al 2018 consequently it is imperative to develop an effective and robust strategy to control the membrane fouling in md pretreatment prior to the membrane process is considered as one of the effective ways for the alleviation of the membrane fouling by altering the biological and or physicochemical characters of the feed solution tijing et al 2015 to date several methods including coagulation precipitation zheng et al 2020 membrane filtration gao et al 2011 adjustment of ph yu et al 2018 sonication hou et al 2016 and pre oxidation guo et al 2020 were employed as pretreatment methods for the water treatment and or desalination in recent years the sulfate radical so4 based advanced oxidation process by persulfate ps activation has gained extensive attention for reducing contaminants in surface waste water due to the superior oxidation capacity of so4 in a wide range of ph conditions asif et al 2021 duan et al 2015 it has been reported that there are various ways such as ultraviolet irradiation transition metal ions heterogeneous catalysts and heating were used for the activation of ps to oxidize organic matter in wastewater and alleviate membrane fouling guo et al 2021 han et al 2022 thereinto heating activation shows great potential as the pretreatment prior to md process ascribed to the following reasons i effective degradation of micropollutants and organic foulants ii no demands of additional heating source for persulfate activation as md is a thermally driven process and iii free of secondary pollution because no extra chemical activators are required to be induced alkhatib et al 2021 asif et al 2019 previous studies demonstrated that the factors concerning membrane fouling are complicated including particular matters dissolved organic matter dom inorganic substances as well as microorganisms gao et al 2020 liu et al 2020 wong et al 2021 in general dom is recognized as one of the main culprits for the flux decline because it ubiquitously exists in real waters wherein the characteristics of the organic components have great impact on the fouling formation process through the special interaction with membranes fan et al 2001 gryta et al 2001 naidu et al 2014 for examples tan et al tan et al 2016 demonstrated that a concave interface would be formed by the deposition of humic acid ha on the md membrane surface leading to a 25 63 flux decline through the kelvin effect naidu et al 2014 found alginate acid contributed to minimal fouling compared to ha and bovine serum albumin bsa mainly due to its higher hydrophilicity and the negative electrostatic repulsion however the component of dom in the real context such as surface water ground water wastewater etc composing of polyhydroxyaromatics aliphatics polysaccharides proteins acidic hydrocarbons and micro pollutants is extremely complicated retarding the in depth cognition of fouling mechanism and the development of effective fouling controlling strategy fang et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 this is further complicated when in the heat activated ps pretreatment integrated membrane process as ps activation would change the dom characteristics by partially oxidizing the organic chemicals and transforming them into multifarious intermediate products and co2 further changing the membrane fouling process asif et al found that the ps activation at the md operation temperature would effectively degrade the micropollutants featuring strong electron donating functional groups and achieve 80 removal of total organic carbon thereby alleviating the membrane fouling asif et al 2021 however little is known with reference to the molecular transformation of complex dom during the heat activated ps pretreatment and its influences on the membrane fouling at the molecular level in the md process hence the md system integrated with heat activated ps pretreatment was conducted to synergistically remove the dom and alleviate membrane fouling in treatment of real surface water and secondary treated effluent the non targeted screening method of two dimensional gas chromatography time of flight mass spectrometry gc gc tof ms were used in this study in an attempt to better understand the transformation and migration of organics during the membrane fouling control process the influence of ps concentration and temperature on the dom removal and membrane fouling behavior were comprehensively evaluated wherein the variation of the molecular formulas in dom by pretreatment was analyzed by gc gc tof ms further the distribution of the molecular components and the physico chemical property of the membrane fouling were identified by the combination of various characterization this study is anticipated to offer some new perspectives for the membrane fouling mechanism and control strategies 2 materials and methods 2 1 source water and reagents the secondary effluent and surface water samples were collected from the qiaobei wastewater treatment plant wwtp in nanjing jiangsu province china and qingliu river in chuzhou anhui province china respectively the primary water quality was listed in table s1 supporting information si before the ps activation and md experiment the raw water samples were filtered using the 0 45 μm polyethersulfone filter to remove suspended particles and colloids and then stored under 4 c polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe flat sheet membranes with the average pore size thickness and porosity of 0 22 μm 100 μm and 70 respectively were purchased from wanda filter material company haining china analytical grade sodium peroxydisulfate ps na2s2o8 98 purity and thiosulphate pentahydrate na2s2o3 5h2o 99 purity were bought from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd beijing china prior to usage ps powder was dissolved into deionized water to prepare the stock solution with the concentration of 100 mm and then stored under 4 c 2 2 heat activated ps pretreatment the heat activated ps pretreatments were performed in a 3 l glass reactor under continuous stirring at a certain temperature the reaction temperature was maintained using a thermoplastic water bath equipped with the constant temperature control device in a typical experiment the volume of the reaction solution was 2 l and a certain amount of ps was added into it to initiate the catalytic process the oxidation pretreatment experiments lasted for a period of 60 min and samples were retrieved at a certain time intervals for further analysis after the reaction a stoichiometric amount of na2s2o3 5h2o was added into the solution to quench the residual oxidants for the md process in this study the concentrations of ps were set to be 0 0 2 0 4 and 0 8 mm respectively and the activation temperature ranged from 60 to 90 c all experiments were carried out in triplicate for the repeatability 2 3 dcmd test a bench scale direct contact membrane distillation dcmd system was installed in this study and shown in fig s1 the dcmd system was composed of a feed tank with the volume of 2 l membrane module distillate tank with the volume of 2 l temperature recorder and two peristaltic pumps dlpump550 kamoer china the heating and cooling were achieved by thermostat water bath and chiller respectively the membrane module was made using polymethyl methacrylate with an effective membrane area of 55 cm2 typically the dcmd was operated in a countercurrent mod and the flow rate was set to 6 16 cm s for both feed and permeate side the feed inlet temperature was maintained the same as the reaction temperature of the heat activated ps pretreatments i e 60 70 80 and 90 c while the permeate inlet temperature was kept constant at 10 c during the test the real time weight change of the permeate tank was recorded using a digital balance auy120 shimadzu china after the dcmd test the used membranes were air dried in a desiccator for further characterization the fouled membranes were labeled as mqb n m and mql n m for that related to qiaobei wwtp and qingliu river respectively where n and m represents the concentration of ps and operation temperature respectively 2 4 analysis the nontargeted screening method of two dimensional gas chromatography time of flight mass spectrometry gc gc tof ms ggt620 guangzhou hexin instrument co ltd china system was employed to analyze the molecular components in water samples and membrane fouling noticeably the fouled membranes were subjected to the sonication at 20 c for 3 h to obtain the extracts membrane foulants for further analysis the uv254 was analyzed using an uv visible spectrometer 1780 shimadzu china at the wavelength of 254 nm total organic carbon analyzer multi n c 2100 jena germany was employed to determine the total organic carbon toc the morphology the fouling layer were detected by field emission scanning electron microscope fesem zeiss merlin gemini 2 germany attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared atr ftir perkin elmer spectrum 2000 american was used to analyze the chemical functional group on the membrane surface within the wave number ranging from 4000 to 100 cm 1 in order to evaluate the hydrophilicity the static water contact angles of membrane samples were examined using the drop shape analyzer cam200 attension finland the reactive species generated during the pms activation process were detected by the electron spin resonance esr spectra emxplus 6 1 bruker germany quenching tests were performed to investigate the dominant radicals responsible for the degradation of dom wherein ethanol etoh was used as scavenger for so4 and oh and tert butyl alcohol tba was used as the scavenger for oh 3 results and discussion 3 1 organics removal by heat activated ps pretreatment the typical indexes of dissolving organic matter dom in water samples including uv254 and toc were monitored to evaluate the organics removal performance by the heat activated ps pretreatment before the ps activation the initial uv254 concentration for qiaobei wwtp and qingliu river were 0 097 and 0 102 cm 1 respectively and the corresponding toc concentration were 6 44 and 9 78 mg l respectively table s1 the effect of the ps concentration was firstly investigated by controlling the reaction temperature at 80 c and the results are shown in fig 1 it is clear that negligible amount of uv254 and toc were removed without the addition of ps implying that organics can hardly be eliminated with the heating alone for both two water samples after the induction of ps into raw water the removal efficiency of uv254 and toc showed a positive correlation with the concentration of ps with the ps concentration increasing from 0 2 to 0 8 mm the uv254 removal at 60 min increased from 25 9 to 62 0 and 26 5 to 68 6 for the raw water in qiaobei wwtp and qingliu river respectively the final toc removal for qiaobei wwtp and qingliu river increased from 16 2 to 40 7 and 11 3 to 37 0 respectively it is worth noting that the removal rate of toc was generally lower than that of uv254 this is mainly because large dom tended to be partially degraded into smaller organic molecules rather than complete mineralization into co2 and h2o guan et al 2017 suva254 parameter defined as the ratio of uv absorbance and organic carbon content is generally applied to describe the aromaticity and hydrophobicity of dom filloux et al 2012 compared with raw water suva254 values were strikingly decreased after pretreatment table s2 implying the efficient isolation or elimination of hydrophobic fractions and aromatic structures kim et al 2008 zarebska et al 2004 additionally limited improvement in organics removal was observed when the ps concentration was further increased from 0 4 to 0 8 mm suggesting that 0 4 mm was the optimized ps concentration for the degradation of raw water therefore the ps concentration of 0 4 mm was adopted for the further experiments to investigate the influence of reaction temperature fig 2 shows the effect of temperature on the degradation performance of uv254 and toc by ps activation within the temperature range of 60 90 c similar trend was observed for both water samples in qiaobei wwtp and qingliu river at the reaction temperature below 70 c heat activated ps pretreatment only triggered small removal of uv254 and toc 20 in general when the temperature was increased to 80 and 90 c both uv254 and toc removal exhibited a pronounced improvement to over 55 for uv254 and over 32 for toc these results illustrate that heat activated ps treatment can exert appreciable degradation efficiency on the organic pollutants regardless of the diversity of water quality the lower values of toc removal than that of uv254 at different temperature further verified that partial degradation of doms and considerable organic intermediates were generated in the ps oxidation process moreover the suva254 values gradually decreased with the increasing temperature demonstrating that higher temperature facilitated the degradation of hydrophobic organics which would benefit the alleviation of membrane fouling furthermore epr analysis was performed to in situ identify the free radicals as seen from fig s2a the characteristic peaks of dmpo oh adducts αh 14 8 αn 14 8 and dmpo so4 adducts αh 0 78 αh 1 48 αh 9 6 and αn 13 2 were presented in the epr spectrum confirming both so4 and oh were generated in the pretreatment process notably the characteristic signals of radicals gradually intensified with the increase of temperature which suggests that the reaction temperature exhibited a positive effect on the production of free radical at the same time the results of quenching test reveals that both so4 and oh gave rise to the degradation of organics while so4 were the main radicals responsible for the dom removal fig s2b 3 2 transformation of the molecular components of dom by heat activated ps pretreatment to further investigate the changes of molecular formulas of dom after the heat activated ps pretreatment the water samples related to qiaobei wwtp were analyzed by gc gc tof ms measurement with ei source for the non targeted screening of molecular structure information as can be seen from fig s3 a total of 749 organic compounds were identified in the raw water sample these compounds could be further classified into 6 categories according to the element composition containing cho ch chno chn chos chnos and others wherein cho compounds were denoted as the molecules only containing c h and o elements and so on among them cho compounds occupied the highest proportion with 42 9 for intensity and 43 2 for numbers this is contributed to considerable presence of carboxylic acids ester polar alcohols aldehydes ketones etc wherein the proportion of butyl 9 12 octadecadienoate c22h40o2 was up to 24 8 in intensity ch compounds were mainly composed of low polarity and nonpolar substances such as alkanes alkenes and aromatic hydrocarbons dominating the proportion of 34 3 and 28 5 in terms of peak intensities and numbers respectively besides the relative abundance of chno components ranked the third among the dom primarily derived from amino acids and nitro compounds the comparison of the change in the molecular formulas of dom at various ps concentration is shown in fig 3 a in the absence of the ps there was little change in the relative abundance of organic compounds in accordance with the results of uv254 and toc analysis when the ps concentration was increased from 0 2 to 0 4 mm the chemical diversity and relative intensity of molecular components in the dom were prominently diminished by the oxidation in which the molecules only containing cho and ch components were still the most abundant it is speculated that the reaction of oxygen addition was the common reaction during the pretreatment process as the relative abundance of oxygen containing substances were obviously increased jeong et al 2014 on the contrary the oxygen deficient substances were freely consumed especially unsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbons aromatic hydrocarbon and alkane through addition reaction to the unsaturated bonds e g c c electron transfer and hydrogen abstraction by free radicals padmaja et al 1993 varanasi et al 2018 wojnarovits and takacs 2019 in addition unequable changes on the relative abundance of chno chn and chos chnos formulas were detected illustrating that multiple reactions including addition reaction substitute reaction and deamination occurred among them which contributed to the heterogeneous transformation of molecular structure varanasi et al 2018 the molecular weight distribution shows that the organic components with significant intensities were mostly concentrated in the range of 100 400 mw after the ps oxidation pretreatment fig s6 and table s3 by contrast with the raw water the distinct decline in the intensity weighed average molecular weight mww was noted in cho ch and chn compounds which confirmed the transformation of these components with higher mw to smaller molecules in dom fig 3b illustrates the influence of temperature on the molecular structure in dom by the pretreatment with the temperature increasing from 60 c to 80 c the proportion of the predominant cho compounds decreased from 63 4 to 44 7 and 45 7 to 41 7 for the peak intensities and numbers respectively which was mainly resulted from the considerable depletion of short chain aldehydes and phenols however when the temperature further increased to 90 c the content of cho compounds unexpectedly became higher probably due to the transformation of nitrogenous organic compounds such as amide nitrile and so on into cho compounds through addition reaction and or oxidative deamination zhang et al 2021 which could be confirmed by the decrease of the contents of chn and chno compounds as well as the increase of mww value of cho compounds besides other molecular components in dom were sensitive to the temperature changes and their internal structures were destructed in different ways song et al 2022 zhang et al 2019 as a result the mww of dom reduced first and then increased with the rising of temperature with the minimum of 299 38 da for the temperature of 80 c fig s6 and table s3 double bond equivalent dbe is another parameter describing the unsaturation degree of the component in dom which is calculated by the following equation fu et al 2022 koch and dittmar 2006 wan et al 2020 dbe 2 c 2 h n x 2 where c is the number of carbon atoms h is the number hydrogen atoms n is the number of nitrogen atoms and x is the number of halogen atoms as shown in fig s7 and s8 the precursors involving in the oxidation process featured higher carbon atom numbers and dbe values whereas the products exhibited the opposite tendency after pretreatment this manifests that the refractory organics with higher mw and unsaturation degree were effectively destroyed ascribed to the cleavage of cc bonds or aliphatic rings instead of co bonds in compounds which agrees well with the aforementioned results 3 3 effects of heat activated ps pretreatment on membrane fouling the normalized flux j j0 was employed to depict the membrane fouling rate during the md process fig 4 shows the flux changed with time at different ps concentration and temperature obviously the membrane fouling was effectively mitigated by the heat activated ps pretreatment in the absence of heat activated ps pretreatment the md performance could be approximately divided into two stages in the initial periods rapid flux declines were observed for both qiaobei wwtp and qingliu river sampling solutions which was mainly because the higher concentration of dom accelerated the attachment of foulants on the membrane surface in later periods the normalized flux became steady and maintained at a relatively low level suggesting the complete formation of fouling layer the lower j j0 value of qingliu river sampling solution after 12 h operation was probably associated with its higher content of organic matters after the pretreatment by ps activation at 80 c the flux curves tended to be smoothly and the final j j0 values were significantly improved to high level which was more apparent with the higher ps concentration however for qingliu river sample higher dose of ps at 0 8 mm has little improvement when compared with the ps concentration of 0 4 mm moreover the flux curves of water samples with and without the pretreatment exhibited distinct difference at two stages which could be ascribed to the variation of organic compounds during pretreatment fig 4 b and d demonstrates the influence of operation temperature on the flux change at the ps concentration of 0 4 mm it can be seen that the diminishing rate of the normalized flux gradually slowed down with the temperature increasing from 60 to 80 c wherein the final j j0 values increased from 0 59 to 0 74 for qiaobei wwtp sampling solutions while 0 54 to 0 73 for qingliu river sampling solutions unexpectedly a faster flux decline occurred when the operation temperature was further increased to 90 c and the final j j0 values dropped by 7 and 26 compared to that of 80 c for qiaobei wwtp and qingliu river samples respectively this was probably caused by the following reasons christie et al 2022 liu et al 2022 yan et al 2017 i faster concentrating rate of contaminants under higher feed temperature would boost the deposition of dom and the crystallization of inorganic salts on the membrane surface ii the driven force under higher feed temperature was stronger which could favor the formation of fouling layer with more compact structure thus leading to the hinderance on the transport of water vapor additionally it is worth noting that the contaminants were almost completely removed after the md operation with and without pretreatment table s4 3 4 mechanism of membrane fouling 3 4 1 molecular components on the membrane fouling the molecular components of extracts from fouled membrane were analyzed to evaluate the fouling potential of dom before and after pretreatment it can be seen from fig 5 that significant difference in the molecular components were recorded between the deposited foulants and feed solution while the chemical compounds containing oxygen element was dominated in the feed solution the relative intensity of the oxygen deficient compounds was remarkably increased in the fouled membrane for the samples related to qiaobei wwtp the ch compounds with the relative intensity over 50 were mainly responsible for the membrane fouling in both mqb 0 80 and mqb 0 4 80 which was probably ascribed to their hydrophobic characteristic thus resulting in the membrane binding affinity through hydrophobic interactions as for the samples associated with qingliu river cho compounds were the primary components in the membrane foulants despite small decrease of their relative intensities from 40 2 and 46 8 for ql 0 80 and ql 0 4 80 to 35 5 and 43 2 for mql 0 80 and mql 0 4 80 respectively it was noting that the relative intensity of ch compounds was still enriched in the membrane fouling regardless of their low content in the qingliu river in alignment with qiaobei wwtp fig 6 shows that the molecular weight distribution of most organic substances in membrane foulants was left shift comparing with those in the relative feed solution samples indicating that the compounds with lower mw were more inclined to be adsorbed on the membrane surface the molecular weight distribution in all samples from membrane foulants followed the similar trend in which the most fractions were within the mw ranges of 0 300 200 300 100 300 and 300 400 for cho chn chno and chos chnos components respectively it is noteworthy that the small molecules would be considerably generated by the heat activated ps pretreatment which is adverse to the alleviation of membrane fouling to some extent this suggests that the molecular weight of organics is not the major factor affecting the development of membrane fouling in addition it was observed that the membrane foulants were rich in the chemical compounds featuring higher dbe values fig s8 and s9 illustrating the unsaturation components played an essential role in membrane fouling based on the analysis in section 3 1 and 3 2 the heat activated ps pretreatment could effectively change the molecular components in dom wherein the oxygen containing substances were significantly enriched and the organics with higher unsaturation degree were destroyed leading to the reduction in both uv254 and toc these results manifest that the heat activated ps pretreatment would effectively mitigate the membrane fouling not only relying on the diminishment of the amount of the organics but also the variation of the molecular conformation in dom to further understand the membrane fouling mechanism the identified substances were further classified into 3 categories such as alicyclics aliphatics and aromatics according to the carbon skeletons and 22 subcategories in terms of the functional groups i e alcohols aldehydes ketones esters ethers carboxylic acids heterocycles alicyclic hydrocarbons halohydrocarbons amides amines nitriles hydrazines nitro compounds sulfurous acid esters sulphones thiones acyl chlorides phenols thioethers thiols and thiones the heat map in fig 7 demonstrates the relative abundances of most chemical compounds in the raw water were greatly diminished by heat activated ps pretreatment which would benefit the mitigation of membrane fouling irrespective of the significant discrepancies in organic substances of the feed solution from qiaobei wwtp and qingliu river before and after pretreatment membrane foulants were mainly concentrated in the aliphatics classification which may be due to that the chain compounds possess lower surface tension having higher tendency attaching on the membrane surface via adsorption boo et al 2018 furthermore all membrane fouling samples shared 7 most abundant subcategory species including 5 aliphatics i e halohydrocarbons amides nitriles alcohols and unsaturated hydrocarbons 1 alicyclic substance i e heterocycles and 1 aromatic substance i e ester specifically alkanes presented the highest relative abundance in mqb 0 80 and mqb 0 4 80 which is mainly resulted from the spontaneous adsorption through hydrophobic hydrophobic short range interaction on the membrane surface yu et al 2021 density functional theory dft was employed to further investigate the interaction between the common compounds with high abundance and ptfe membrane as can be seen from fig s10 the bule zone in the isosurface represents the strong attraction i e hydrogen bonding while the greener isosurface is regarded as the van der waals interaction with weak intensity obviously the van der waals interaction was the predominant attraction contributing to the deposition of contaminants on membrane surface it is also worth mentioning that the relative abundance of several other species i e halohydrocarbons in alicyclics and aromatics ethers aldehydes carboxylic acids etc were lower in membrane foulants compared with that in feed solution suggesting that these compounds were not liable to interact with membrane surface to form membrane fouling due to the higher hydrophilicity and or electrostatic repulsion 3 4 2 characterization of fouled md membranes to further gain insights into the fouling propensity the morphologies of the pristine and fouled membrane were characterized by sem fig 8 a b displays that the pristine ptfe membrane was consisted of the loose packed support layer and the thinner active layer featuring typical fiber nodule microporous structure for raw qingliu river water after the md test with for 12 h a dense thick foulant layer was observed on the membrane surface with the thickness of 7 10 μm fig 3c d as a comparison the deposition of foulants on the membrane was significantly reduced by the heat activated ps pretreatment wherein most of the reticular structure of ptfe membrane could be visibly distinguished as for the raw water of qiaobei wwtp a distinguishing surface topology was observed fig s11 the rock like pollutant foulant particles were closely stacked on the membrane surface forming a rather milder fouling layer compared to that of qingliu river which was likely due to the lower concentration of dom and salinity after pretreatment the size of the agglomerating foulants was remarkably smaller than that of raw water which might because the heat activated ps pretreatment restrain the complexation between high valence cations and organics ge et al 2014 facilitating the transport of water vapors sem eds analysis was carried out to investigate the element distribution in the fouling layer and the results were shown in fig s12 17 it is revealed that besides f mainly deriving from the pristine ptfe membrane other elements including c o s cl ca mg si and fe were also found in the fouling layers wherein c o and ca elements were dominate components suggesting the combined effect of organic deposition and calcium scaling on the membrane surface during md process which was consistent with the previous reports li et al 2016 liu et al 2017 however the comparison of eds spectrum indicates that the abundance of all fouling elements was significantly decreased with the filtration of pretreated water illustrating that the ps oxidation pretreatment could synchronously degrade the organic pollutants and restrain the inorganic precipitation thus leading to reduced membrane fouling the variation of the functional groups of membrane surface after md filtration was evaluated by ftir spectra as displayed in fig 9 the pristine ptfe membrane exhibited three characteristic peaks centering at 1200 cm 1 1140 cm 1and 627 cm 1 respectively corresponding to the stretching vibration of cf2 groups liu et al 2018 by contrast the intensity of these three transmittance bands was obviously decreased when the membranes were fouled by raw water qiaobei wtp and qingliu river sampling solutions which was mainly owing to the coverage of considerable contaminants meanwhile new peaks appeared at around 870 cm 1 1401 cm 1 and 3234 cm 1 for the mqb 0 80 and mql 0 80 the peak located at 870 cm 1 corresponded to the co coc bonds or c h bending in polysaccharides fu et al 1999 zhao et al 2009 the peaks among 3000 3500 cm 1 could be attributed to the n h bond stretching mode of amide groups whereas the broad character was probably due to the presence of carboxylate or carbohydrate belfer et al 2000 the band peaks at 1440 cm 1 and 2987 cm 1 in mqb 0 4 80 were assigned to the ch bending vibration of alkanes and amide iii bonds or stretching of the side chain coo in proteins respectively li et al 2016 the small peak at the wave number of and 1097 cm 1 in mql 0 4 80 was ascribed to the co vibration deriving from carbohydrates after pretreatment the related peaks of organics on the membrane surface were obviously weakened or disappeared while the peaks deriving from ptfe membrane became stronger confirming the alleviation of membrane fouling notably there existed blue shift of the characteristic peak and change of the peak shape after the pretreatment which maybe ascribed to the variation of the organic conformation liu et al 2018 the surface hydrophobicity was assessed through contact angle to further investigated to influence of heat activated ps pretreatment on the membrane fouling it can be seen from fig s18 that the membranes treated by using raw water as feed solution became more hydrophilic contact angles were 61 6 and 114 4 for qingliu river and qiaobei wwtp samples respectively than pristine membrane contact angles was 161 1 implying the deposition of the contaminants with hydrophilic groups comparatively the contact angles were elevated to varying degrees for the membranes fouled by pretreated raw water which was likely because that a certain amount of the foulants were degraded by ps activation and the membrane surfaces were partially exposed contributing to the improvement of hydrophobicity 4 conclusions in this study the effects of the heat activated ps pretreatment on the dom removal and md membrane fouling control in treating real secondary effluent and surface water was systematically investigated the membrane fouling in the md process could be effectively mitigated by the heat activated ps pretreatment wherein the ps concentration of 0 4 mm and temperature of 80 c was the optimum condition in this study for pretreating raw water from qiaobei wwtp and qiangliu river in terms of contaminants removal and flux decline rate comprehensive characterization of raw water and fouled membranes reveals the membrane fouling control process at molecular level with key findings as listed below 1 dom in secondary effluent qiaobei wwtp and surface water qiangliu river were subjected to the structural transformation and mineralization with the highest toc removal of 40 7 and 37 0 respectively at the ps concentration of 0 8 mm and temperature of 80 c within 60 min based on the gc gc tof ms analysis the oxygen addition was the most frequently detected reaction during the pretreatment as the relative abundance of oxygen containing substances were remarkably increased the precursors involving in the ps activation process possessed higher molecular weight and dbe values whereas the products exhibited the opposite tendency after pretreatment in this way the refractory organics with higher mw and unsaturation degree were effectively destroyed by heat activated ps pretreatment 2 heat activated ps pretreatment controlled the md membrane fouling through four ways i reducing the dom concentration ii changing the molecular conformation iii restraining the complexation between high valence cations and organics and iv hampering the precipitation of inorganics thereinto aliphatics were mainly responsible for the membrane fouling at the same time all membrane foulant samples from qiaobei wwtp and qiangliu river shared 7 species with highest abundance including 5 aliphatics halohydrocarbons amides nitriles alcohols and unsaturated hydrocarbons 1 alicyclic substance i e heterocycles and 1 aromatic substance i e ester wherein the van der waals interaction was the primary attraction between these contaminants with membrane moreover the organics with higher dbe values and lower mw preferred to be deposited on the membrane surface and cause membrane fouling declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

15248,cooperating in harmony to avoid competition with dominant functional microbial symbiosis is an efficient way in advanced nitrogen and phosphorus removal in wastewater treatment processes in this study a niche based coordinating strategy was implemented to cooperate in harmony with phosphorus accumulating organisms paos denitrifying phosphorus accumulating organisms dpaos and denitrifying glycogen accumulating organisms dgaos to advance nitrogen and phosphorus removal based on an anaerobic anoxic oxic anoxic membrane bioreactor a2o a mbr under low c n in municipal wastewater influent the niche based strategy was conducted based on the orp change during the process as an indicator combined with the adjustment of recirculation and anoxic zone shifting the results indicated that the strategy of the post anoxic unit could enable significant enhancement of biological nitrogen and phosphorus removal bnpr by 9 9 and 16 3 respectively with low effluent concentrations of 7 0 2 2 mg n l and 0 36 0 32 mg p l the satisfactory performance was dominated along with the shift in the microbial community the relative abundance of tetrasphaera pao genus increased from 0 14 0 08 to 0 32 0 12 while the relative abundance of decchloromonas dgao genus and candidatus competibacter dgao genus also increased the advanced combination of anaerobic phosphorus release anoxic denitrification denitrifying phosphorus removal and endogenous denitrification was qualified by the modeling simulation of the biochemical kinetics mechanism of activated sludge in the a2o mbr and a2o a mbr processes which means that cooperation in the harmony of paos dpaos and dgaos could be efficiently realized by a promising control strategy to enhance bnpr in an a2o mbr with a post anoxic unit this study provides an efficient and simple novel control strategy to overcome the limitation of traditional nitrogen and phosphorus removal under an insufficient carbon source graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords functional microbial symbiosis advanced nitrogen and phosphorus removal denitrifying phosphorus removal endogenous denitrification tetrasphaera data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction excessive discharge of nitrogen and phosphorus is the main cause of eutrophication so advanced nitrogen and phosphorus removal in wastewater is urgent conley et al 2009 hautier et al 2014 currently discharge quality standards of wastewater treatment plants wwtps are generally becoming increasingly more stringent to reduce the emissions of nitrogen and phosphorus however deeper levels of nitrogen and phosphorus removal are challenging because of insufficient influent carbon sources for biological nitrogen and phosphorus removal bnpr in conventional processes gong et al 2020 wang et al 2022a wang et al 2022 zhao et al 2018 many previous studies have proven that the conflict of achieving simultaneous removal of nitrogen and phosphorus in municipal sewage with low c n ratio as shown in table 1 so it is necessary to improve the wastewater treatment process and optimize the operation condition to regulate the functional bacteria in the bnpr process the coexistence of several key organograms namely phosphorus accumulating organisms paos and denitrifying glycogen accumulating organisms dgaos and denitrifying ordinary heterotrophic organisms play critical roles in the enhanced bnpr but their competition for organic matter leads to contradictions in wastewater with a low c n ratio in the conventional enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr process denitrifying ordinary heterotrophic organisms compete with paos for carbon sources in the influent with low c n ratio resulting in poor nitrogen and phosphorus removal performance yang et al 2010 in the anaerobic and aerobic stages dgaos utilize a similar metabolism as paos but they do not accumulate polyphosphate tu and schuler 2013 past studies have focused on how to inhibit the growth of dgaos to further ebpr processes or to inhibit the growth of paos and selectively strengthen dgaos to achieve advanced nutrient removal via endogenous denitrification dan et al 2021 wang et al 2021a when paos and dgaos coexist how they can play their respective roles rather than inhibit each other remains largely unknown the emergence of innovative biological phosphorus removal strategies may solve this contradiction among microorganisms for example denitrifying phosphorus accumulating organisms dpaos and side stream enhanced biological phosphorus removal s2ebpr processes fu et al 2019 marques et al 2018 wang et al 2019a especially dpaos for enhanced bnpr effects are particularly significant a recent study showed that anoxic conditions may be an implementable strategy for maintaining denitrifying phosphorus removal performance in wwtps sun et al 2020 zaman et al 2021 found that dpaos had a competitive advantage over nitrite oxidizing bacteria for nitrite consumption and played a vital role in simultaneous denitrification and phosphorus removal at low do 0 3 0 05 mg l for treating carbon limited municipal wastewater additionally paos tetrasphaera with fermentation capability were found and fernando et al 2019 showed that tetrasphaera contributed to phosphorus removal as much as or more than the conventional candidatus accumulibacter in 8 danish wwtps many studies have also reported the synergistic effect of paos dpaos and dgaos to achieve advanced nitrogen and phosphorus removal but most of them were conducted by using synthetic wastewater or laboratory scale sequencing batch reactor where activities of paos dpaos and dgaos can be easily regulated ji et al 2020 lu et al 2022 wang et al 2021b wu et al 2021 it remains to be further explored how paos dpaos and dgaos play their respective roles rather than inhibit each other in full scale wwtps with the continuous push flow in particular it is still not clear what conditions are favorable for a stable denitrifying phosphorus removal and endogenous denitrification process because paos dpaos and dgaos would compete for the limit carbon source the mbr membrane bioreactor process is considered a promising wastewater treatment strategy huang et al 2010 xiao et al 2019 main highlights of mbr technology include small footprint high effluent quality complete separation of hydraulic retention time hrt and solids retention time srt etc however conventional mbr has poor phosphorus removal efficiency due to the sludge with higher dissolved oxygen do concentration returned from the membrane tank and long srt different studies have suggested that the removal efficiency of tp was 43 5 and 56 in different full scale mbrs respectively falahti marvast and karimi jashni 2015 hu et al 2014 metal salt induced phosphorus precipitation and enhanced microbial processes are two alternatives for overcoming poor phosphorus removal however the added metal salts exhibited a more significant contribution to membrane fouling than biopolymers for example iron to phosphorus molar ratio of 1 4 when iron trichloride is added which will produce serious irreversible membrane fouling asif et al 2021 lyko et al 2007 zhang et al 2015 therefore how to promote the harmonious symbiosis of paos dpaos and dgaos in mbr process is more promising as a limitation of the traditional understanding of nitrogen and phosphorus removal to cooperate in harmony to avoid the competition of the different highly efficient dominant functional microbial symbioses on advanced nitrogen and phosphorus removal a niche based coordinating strategy to cooperate in harmony with paos dpaos and dgaos to advance nitrogen and phosphorus removal was proposed based on an anaerobic anoxic oxic anoxic membrane bioreactor a2o a mbr with low c n in the influent the niche based strategy adopted the orp change throughout the process as an indicator combined with adjusting the recirculation reflux ratio sludge concentration and setting of the post anoxic unit to assess the contribution of each tank to nitrogen and phosphorus removal the conversion and synergistic effects of denitrifying ordinary heterotrophic organisms paos dpaos and dgaos were investigated on a pilot scale of the a2o mbr process with real municipal wastewater the mechanisms of enhanced bnpr were assessed by the developed model of phosphorus release denitrifying phosphorus removal and endogenous denitrification in the a2o a mbr process 16s rrna high throughput technology was used to track the bacterial community structures during operation these novel insights into microbial symbiosis hopefully will provide important guidance for advanced nitrogen and phosphorus removal 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater source seed sludge and experimental setup the a2o a mbr was fed settled primary municipal wastewater with a cod of 170 2 42 2 mg l tp of 4 1 1 1 mg l and tn of 42 3 8 2 mg n l the pilot scale plant was seeded with activated sludge from a full scale membrane bioreactor treating domestic wastewater chengdu sichuan china the pilot scale a2o a mbr plant length width height 6000 mm 2000 mm 1000 mm thickness 6 mm effective volume of 10 m3 consisted of an 8 m3 a2o bioreactor tank anaerobic unit 0 83 m3 anoxic unit 3 33 m3 oxic unit 4 17 m3 and a 1 67 m3 membrane bioreactor unit meanwhile the membrane bioreactor unit and oxic unit were aerated at a flow rate of 10 l min to alleviate membrane fouling by a blower the suction pump was operated in a timing sequence which consisted of an 8 min switch on and a 2 min switch off the total net filtration flux was maintained at 12 l m2 h resulting in an hrt of 13 9 h and a daily treatment capacity of 17 3 m3 transmembrane pressure tmp was measured by a pressure transmitter and recorded automatically the weekly membrane maintenance cleaning was performed using backflush with citric acid 0 2 solution and naclo 0 005 solution in sequence through the membrane and the cleaning intensity for each solution was 1 7 l m2 membrane when the operation was terminated at tmp of 50 kpa membranes were sequentially soaked in the solutions of citric acid 2 and naclo 0 05 for 16 h respectively to facilitate nutrient removal the reactor was provided with three internal recyclings irs and the internal recycling ratio irr was calculated where ir1 connects the membrane bioreactor unit and oxic unit to provide sludge and part of oxygen to oxic unit ir2 connects the oxic unit and anoxic unit to provide sludge to anoxic unit for denitrification and ir3 connects the anoxic unit and anaerobic unit to provide sludge to anaerobic unit for the release of phosphorus anaerobic anoxic and oxic units were provided with a low speed mixer to keep the mixed liquid suspended solid mlss in suspension 2 2 operation conditions and monitoring the a2o a mbr was operated for 400 days consisting of four phases fig 1 and its detailed operations are described in table 2 1 phase i days 0 71 the pilot scale a2o mbr plant was operated as described above during which irr 350 irr2 350 and irr3 350 until the effluent quality and mlss were observed to stabilize phase i served as the baseline period 2 phase ii days 72 120 the pilot scale a2o mbr plant was operated as in phase i but irr3 was adjusted to enhance the biological phosphorus removal efficiency during the operation of phase ii irr3 was reduced to 150 the new irr was selected based on the high orp value of the anaerobic unit in phase i which led to poor biological phosphorus efficiency in the pilot scale plant wilfert et al 2015 x zhang et al 2020 3 3 phase iii day 121 211 the aeration in the t6 tank of the aerobic unit of the pilot scale plant was stopped and adjusted to the post anoxic unit which was selected based on the concentration changes of tn tp ammonia and nitrate in the t1 t7 tanks of phase ii fig s1 to achieve advanced nitrogen and phosphorus removal based on denitrifying phosphorus removal and endogenous denitrification therefore the pilot scale plant was the a2o a mbr process in phase iii and ir2 connected the post anoxic unit and anoxic unit 4 phase iv days 212 400 the operation of the pilot scale a2o a mbr plant was consistent with phase iii under the condition that the effective volume of the pilot scale plant remained unchanged with some modifications the volume of t5 in the oxic unit was reduced and the volume of t6 in the post anoxic unit was increased through the movable baffle between tank t5 and tank t6 to further increase the hrt of the post anoxic unit it was also selected based on the concentration changes of tn tp ammonia and nitrate in the t1 t7 tanks in phase iii fig s1 to further improve the efficiency of bnpr in all phases approximately 500 l d of mixed liquor was discharged in the pilot scale plant srt 20 2 d and the influent and effluent tn tp cod ammonium nitrite and nitrate concentrations were measured three times a week in the t1 t7 tanks of the pilot scale plant the do orp ph temperature values and mlss concentrations along the way were measured three times a week and the concentration changes of tn tp cod ammonium nitrite and nitrate in each tank along the way were measured every two weeks the activated sludge samples of 50 ml mixed liquor were collected each week using sterile centrifuge tubes and then concentrated at 10 000 rpm for 10 min finally the supernatant was removed with a pipette and anhydrous ethanol was added to 50 ml and stored in a 20 c refrigerator for microbial community profiling 2 3 model development to evaluate the experimental data in phase i and phase iv 1000 ml of mixed liquor was collected from the membrane bioreactor in the pilot scale plant and the activated sludge was washed three times and then diluted with real municipal wastewater to 1000 ml regaining the mlss concentration after anaerobic stirring phosphorus release for 120 min the anoxic uptake phosphorus stage proceeded with an initial nitrate concentration of 15 mg n l continuing for 120 min the ph was controlled at 7 5 0 1 to avoid chemical phosphorus precipitation the concentrations of tp nitrate and nitrite in the mixed liquor were measured after membrane 0 45 μm filtration every 30 min during the batch test operation the endogenous denitrification performance of activated sludge was measured a total of 1000 ml of mixed liquor was collected from the membrane bioreactor in the pilot scale plant and the activated sludge was washed three times after replacing the supernatant of the samples with 1 phosphate buffered saline small amounts of nitrite as nano3 were added anoxic stirring was performed for 3 h and liquid samples were taken every 30 min the concentrations of nitrate and cod were measured after membrane 0 45 μm filtration based on nitrogen and phosphorus transformations during the tests a phosphorus release denitrification phosphorus removal and endogenous denitrification model was developed rieger et al 2001 liu et al 2015 the model kinetics and stoichiometry as well as component definitions and parameter values used in the model are summarized in tables s1 3 the estimation was performed in aquasim 2 1 and parameter values were estimated by minimizing the sum of squares of the deviations of the model predictions from the measured data reichert 1998 and calibrating three key parameter values i e the anoxic growth rate of heterotrophs μh the anoxic growth rate of dpaos on nitrate μdpao and the rate constant for storage of xpha qpha 2 4 microbial community analysis to investigate the variations in the microbial community sludge samples were collected from the bioreactor during pilot testing days 44 65 77 105 188 238 323 348 373 389 for 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing the homogeneous mixtures of sludge samples collected from different positions of the biosensor were stored immediately at 80 until dna extraction the extracted dna was the template for pcr amplification targeting the v4 region of the 16s rrna gene using the universal primers 515f 5 gtgccagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and 806r 5 ggactacvsgggtatctaat 3 and the amplicons were sequenced on a miseq platform according to standard protocols the raw dna sequence data were analysed with default settings using quantitative insights into microbial ecology qiime pipeline version 1 7 0 http qiime org the sequences were trimmed step by step including the removal of primers and sequences 300 bp and then assigned to each sample based on their barcodes finally the trimmed sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus using a 97 cut off 2 5 chemical analysis and calculations tn tp cod ammonium nitrite nitrate and mlss in influent effluent and mixed liquor samples were determined with standard methods ministry of environmental protection 2006 the temperature orp ph and do were automatically recorded using a multimeter hach hq30d to understand the mechanism of tp and tn removal a mass balance was performed for tp and tn the mass balance was conducted using the equation 1 mas s in mas s removed mas s out where mass in is the amount of lead entering the system mg h mass removal is the amount of lead removed in the unit mg h and mass out is the amount of lead leaving the system mg h the above equation was implemented for the a2o a mbr system and the removal contribution of tp and tn in each unit was evaluated according to the equations derived from the schematic of the system fig s2 the calculation equations for the removal contributions of nitrogen and phosphorus for individual tanks are described in section 2 of the supplementary materials 3 results 3 1 performance of the pilot scale a2o a mbr plant 3 1 1 performance of nutrients removal the nitrogen phosphorus and cod removal performance of the pilot scale a2o a mbr process is shown in fig 2 the average concentration of influent ammonia nitrogen was 29 0 3 6 n mg l and the effluent was mainly nitrate with ammonia 1 n mg l and nitrite 0 2 n mg l which validated the satisfactory nitrification of the plant fig 2a the average concentrations of effluent tn were 11 6 2 5 mg n l 10 9 1 9 mg n l 6 9 2 8 mg n l and 7 0 2 2 mg n l in phases i iv respectively and the average tn removal efficiencies were 77 5 4 6 78 5 5 4 86 1 6 1 and 88 4 7 6 respectively fig 2e moreover the average concentration of influent tp was 4 1 1 1 p mg l the average concentrations of effluent tp were 0 96 0 68 and 0 97 0 64 p mg l in phases i ii and the average tp removal efficiency was 76 3 16 6 and 75 3 16 0 respectively however with the addition of post anoxic units in phases iii iv the average concentrations of effluent tp were 0 30 0 16 and 0 36 0 32 p mg l and the average tp removal efficiency increased to 91 3 5 4 and 91 7 7 6 respectively this result suggests that the a2o a mbr process was more conducive to enhancing bnpr than the traditional a2o mbr process without adding additional chemical reagents to remove phosphorus the average concentration of influent cod was 170 2 42 2 mg l the effluent cod was 20 mg l and the removal generally remained higher than 90 throughout the operational process 3 1 2 operational parameter characteristics of do orp ph and temperature alternate anaerobic anoxic oxic processes are considered an effective way to acclimate nitrifiers denitrifiers and paos merzouki et al 1999 notably recent studies iannacone et al 2020 li et al 2020 have found that dpaos can also be enriched in alternate anaerobic anoxic oxic processes therefore do is crucial for nitrogen and phosphorus removal the do of the oxic unit t4 t6 and the membrane bioreactor unit t7 gradually increased in phases i ii and the do mean values of phase ii were 2 9 4 4 5 6 and 6 4 mg l respectively in phases iii iv tank 6 in the oxic unit was adjusted to the post anoxic unit the do mean values of t4 t7 were 4 0 2 0 1 1 and 5 9 mg l in phase iv and t6 was significantly lower than that in phases i ii fig 3a the results showed that lower do may be more effective for ebpr performance which is consistent with the results in the literature izadi et al 2020 zeng et al 2002 the orp of the anaerobic unit is also crucial for ebpr x zhang et al 2020 indicated that regulating orp could enhance the function of denitrifying phosphorus accumulating bacteria and obtained the best denitrifying phosphorus absorbing effect when the orp setting value was 95 mv in the anaerobic stage and preanoxic stage as shown in fig 3b the orp mean values of the anaerobic unit t1 gradually decreased from 25 6 mv in phase i to 78 0 mv in phase iv because of the change in the internal recycling ratio between the anoxic unit and anaerobic unit in phase ii as well as the subsequent adjustment of the post anoxic unit in phases iii iv the orp mean values were 35 7 mv and 19 8 mv in the post anoxic unit respectively in this pilot scale a2o a mbr process study the performance of nitrogen and phosphorus removal throughout the operation also proved that adjusting the anaerobic unit orp can enhance bnpr the ph range of the anaerobic unit anoxic unit oxic unit post anoxic unit and membrane bioreactor unit was 7 4 7 5 the ph range of 7 8 was suitable for nitrification and denitrification and the accumulation of phosphorus by paos sedlak 1991 the removal of nitrogen through ammonia stripping will be negligible below ph 9 5 dawson and murphy 1972 therefore functional bacteria almost dominate the removal of nitrogen and phosphorus throughout the pilot scale process temperature also has a significant effect on the activity of microorganisms in general their activity will increase with temperature until reaching a maximum rate after which inhibition occurs liu et al 2020 this pilot scale a2o a mbr process was operated to treat real municipal wastewater at a wide seasonal temperature change from 13 to 28 c fig 3d the effluent concentrations of tn and tp remained below 10 mg n l and 0 5 mg p l respectively when the temperature dropped from 25 c to 12 c in phase iii and increased back to 25 c in phase iv which also proved the feasibility of a2o a mbr in municipal wastewater treatment over a wide seasonal temperature change to enhance bnpr 3 2 fate of nitrogen and phosphorus throughout the process 3 2 1 fate of nitrogen as shown in fig 4 the nitrogen mass balance of the pilot scale plant during phases i iv was calculated in terms of the measured flow rates internal recycling ratio and tn and ammonia concentrations in each tank in phase i more than 80 of tn was removed in the anoxic unit 95 of the nitrate was removed in the anoxic unit and the contribution of the aerobic unit to the removal of nh4 n reached 100 in phase ii the contribution of anaerobic units to the removal of tn nh4 n and no3 n increased however the tn removal efficiency did not significantly improve in phases iii iv the post anoxic unit was added and the contribution to tn removal increased with increasing volume of the post anoxic unit in phases iv in addition to exogenous denitrification and denitrifying phosphorus removal in the anoxic zone endogenous denitrification also occurred in the post anoxic zone which together contributed to the improvement of tn efficiency based on the mass balance calculation the contribution of endogenous denitrification to tn removal efficiency was 11 3 in phase iv in phase ii and iv do was 5 6 mg l and 1 1 mg l in the t6 resulting in that the do introduced to anoxic unit was 3 56 mg l and 0 55 mg l respectively 5 6 3 5q q 1 5q 3 5q according to the aerobic catabolism equation of cod c6h12o6 6o2 6co2 6h2o energy calculates that about 3 3 mg l and 0 51 mg l cod is consumed in the anoxic unit which is equivalent to the anoxic unit in phase iv can increase the removal of nitrate by 0 8 mg n l however the tn removal in phase iv increased by nearly 4 mg n l compared with that in phase ii so denitrifying phosphorus removal and endogenous denitrification are essential to enhance the nitrogen removal efficiency dpaos and dgaos can conduct denitrification by oxidizing anaerobically accumulated phas to provide energy for glycogen resynthesis and cell growth under anoxic conditions in addition endogenous organic substrates degrade more slowly than exogenous soluble biodegradable organic matter and thus can maintain durable reducing power for denitrification miao et al 2016 the above results indicated that endogenous denitrification driven by dpaos and or dgaos was the dominant nitrogen removal pathway for the post anoxic unit 3 2 2 fate of phosphorus as shown in fig 4 in phases i ii most of the tp was removed by paos in the oxic unit as previously described the paos could not obtain enough organic carbon sources for the release of phosphorus and the synthesis of pha which leads to the deterioration of phosphorus uptake in the anoxic and oxic units in phases iii iv the post anoxic unit promoted the anoxic unit to become the dominant unit for phosphorus removal especially in phase iv and the contribution of the anoxic unit to tp removal reached 65 5 clearly with increasing post anoxic volume the denitrifying phosphorus removal was enhanced the cod concentration was always below 30 mg l in the post anoxic unit which facilitated the occurrence of denitrifying phosphorus removal by using pha as an electron donor hu et al 2002 this result indicated that dpaos play a determining role in the ebpr of the a2o a mbr pilot scale process 3 3 model evaluation of denitrifying phosphorus removal and endogenous denitrification batch tests were performed in phases i and iv to monitor the changes in pao dpao and gao activities in the a2o mbr and a2o a mbr processes the nitrate and phosphorus profiles predicted with the established model are illustrated in fig 5 a b along with the experimental results the model simplifies phosphorus release and uptake without model calibration for changes in pha and glycogen during anaerobic anoxic processes after 2 h of anaerobic phosphorus release nitrate was added to initiate denitrifying phosphorus removal using stored pha by dpaos during the anoxic stage the anaerobic phosphorus release rate in phase i was much lower than that in phase iv and the developed model fitting estimated the qpha of paos in phases i and iv as 9 32 d 1 and 32 64 d 1 respectively this result indicated that the decrease of orp in the anaerobic unit is beneficial to the release of phosphorus in phase iv in the anoxic stage the removal effect of nitrogen and phosphorus in phase iv was better than that in phase i and the model fitting estimated the anoxic growth rate of heterotrophs and the anoxic growth rate of dpaos in phase i μh 8 41 d 1 μdpao 0 22 d 1 and phase iv μh 3 83 d 1 μdpao 7 33 d 1 respectively in addition the endogenous denitrification efficiency was higher in phase iv fig 5c these results indicated that anaerobic phosphorus release denitrifying phosphorus removal and endogenous denitrification were enhanced in the a2o a mbr process and dgaos dpaos and paos can coexist to promote advanced nitrogen and phosphorus removal 3 4 microbial community analysis to further understand the microbial functional mechanism of dgaos paos dpaos and nitrifiers to enhance bnpr the microbial community distribution at the phylum and genus levels was characterized fig 6 most bacteria were classified into proteobacteria and bacteroidetes at the phylum level fig 6a accounting for 54 2 67 3 of the total bacteria this result showed good agreement with previous studies indicating its widespread abundance in full scale wwtps cao et al 2020 the relative abundances of dgaos paos dpaos and nitrifiers at the genus level are shown in fig 6b candidatus competibacter defluviicoccus and propionivibrio belong to dgaos dan et al 2021 and the relative abundance of defluviicoccus and propionivibrio was consistently lower than 0 1 candidatus competibacter was the dominant dgao during the operation and accomplished the endogenous denitrification process with self synthetic endogenous pha consumption the relative abundance of candidatus competibacter was 0 11 0 04 in the a2o mbr process and it increased to 0 25 0 09 in the a2o a mbr process this result might explain the contribution of the post anoxic unit to nitrate removal under the condition of almost no external carbon source candidatus accumulibacter and tetrasphaera have been identified as paos in several previous studies liu et al 2019 marques et al 2018 although tetrasphaera does not store pha compared to candidatus accumulibacter it can better take up complex organic molecules such as amino acids and glucose in the a2o a mbr process the relative abundance of tetrasphaera increased from 0 14 0 08 to 0 32 0 12 and that of candidatus accumulibacter decreased from 0 9 0 43 to 0 61 0 33 it should be noted that although the increase of the relative abundance of tetrasphaera was beneficial to ebpr the relative abundance of candidatus accumulibacter was always higher than tetrasphaera during the operation and the oxic and anoxic phosphorus removal of candidatus accumulibacter could not be neglected although the relative abundance of paos did not change significantly as the orp of the anaerobic unit gradually decreased the proportion of tetrasphaera in paos gradually increased which will be further discussed in section 4 2 dechloromonas pseudomonas acinetobacter aeromonas and flavobacterium were detected in typical dpaos wu et al 2021 in which decchloromonas was always the dominant dpao during the operation in the a2o a mbr process the relative abundance of decchloromonas was 0 92 0 21 which was mainly responsible for the removal of no3 n and po4 3 p in the anoxic unit furthermore nitrifiers with the representative genera nitrosomonas 0 13 0 02 and nitrospira 1 34 0 37 were detected during the operation the results indicated that dgaos paos and dpaos coexisted in the a2o a mbr process to synergistically remove tn and tp which ensured the good stability of the combined process 4 discussion 4 1 dpaos and dgaos synergistically promote the advanced nitrogen and phosphorus removal of wastewater with a low c n ratio many previous studies have demonstrated that the deterioration of ebpr in the wastewater treatment process is due to the proliferation of dgaos which can perform carbon conversions in a similar way to paos without contributing to phosphorus uptake and release shen et al 2017 and that inhibition of dgaos can increase the activity of paos carvalheira et al 2014 especially in the operation mode of mbr few studies have reported that paos dpaos and dgaos cooperate harmoniously to achieve advanced nitrogen and phosphorus removal shown in table 1 however most indicated that the removal efficiencies of tp and tn were difficult to reach 80 simultaneously in previous studies on advanced nitrogen and phosphorus removal dgaos and dpaos were considered to be able to achieve simultaneous endogenous denitrification and denitrifying phosphorus removal as well for dgaos post anoxic denitrification and low do are the main drivers of endogenous denitrification gao et al 2020 winkler et al 2011 for dpaos the most of existing denitrifying phosphorus removal were composed of dual sludge system such as anaerobic anoxic nitrification sequencing batch reactor aan sbr wang et al 2009 aao biological aerated filter aao baf chen et al 2011 because the dual sludge system can effectively solve the conflict of different srt between nitrifying bacteria and dpaos in addition influent with lower c n ratio shortening oxic phase hrt and prolonging anoxic phase hrt also stimulated the growth of dpaos mandel et al 2019 x zhang et al 2020 however most of the reports on synergistic symbiosis of dpaos and dgaos mainly have been carried out under ideal experimental control conditions by lab scale reactor or synthetic wastewater conditions this study for the first time demonstrated the key factors of paos dpaos and dgaos symbiosis in pilot scale a2o a mbr process in a single sludge system to achieve advanced nitrogen and phosphorus removal under actual municipal wastewater influent of low c n this study also showed that lengthening the volume of anoxic unit and shortening the volume of oxic unit could enhance denitrifying phosphorus removal the post anoxic unit also provided favorable conditions for the growth of dgaos because the external carbon source was almost depleted in post anoxic unit and dgaos would consume their own phb to provide energy for the denitrification and glycogen synthesis therefore setting up the post anoxic unit is conducive to the growth of dpaos and dgaos as the main phosphorus removal pathway denitrifying phosphorus removal can also have an ebpr effect without affecting the removal of tn as described in section 3 2 1 post anoxic unit can avoid the loss of 2 8 mg lcod in the anoxic zone which is equivalent to improving the no3 n removal efficiency of 0 8 mg n l however according to the quantitative results the effect of do on tn removal efficiency only accounts for about 1 5 and the remaining effect of tn removal efficiency is mainly due to denitrifying phosphorus removal and endogenous denitrification anaerobic zone and absence of do are defined by low orp the orp is positively correlated with do and no3 n which further indicates that lower no3 n and do lead to lower orp an estimated orp of 200mv will lead to higher phosphorus release from paos or dpaos resulting in greater subsequent aerobic phosphorus uptake vaiopoulou and aivasidis 2008 diaz et al 2022 in this study although the adjusted post anoxic unit reduced the orp in the anaerobic unit 79 mv it was also well below the ideal value which we speculate may be related to the emergence of the novel paos genus tetrasphaera with fermentation capability as will be discussed further in section 4 2 this study indicated that post anoxic promotes endogenous denitrification and further promotes lower do and no3 n returned to the anaerobic unit by internal recycling which is conducive to the release and uptake of phosphorus therefore regulating orp and do in anaerobic anoxic and oxic tanks to promote the synergistic effect of endogenous denitrification and denitrifying phosphorus removal and thus improve the efficiency of conventional bnpr will be the focus of future research in addition the average values of mlss for each unit t1 t7 in a2o a mbr process were 3 8 5 8 5 9 6 8 6 9 6 8 and 8 1 g l which were all lower than the mlss of each unit in the a2o mbr process the observed sludge yield yobs was calculated according to he et al 2021 and the results showed that denitrifying phosphorus removal and endogenous denitrification in the a2o a mbr process were conducive to sludge reduction fig s3 4 2 tetrasphaera and dpaos can effectively enhance carbon source utilization enhancing carbon source utilization when paos tetrasphaera and dgaos coexist and providing dgaos with a low carbon source and low do environment conducive to achieving endogenous denitrification are key to enhanced bnpr as shown in fig 7 in this study when the relative abundance of tetrasphaera and dpaos was increased the use of carbon sources could be enhanced to promote nitrogen and phosphorus removal because tetrasphaera seemed unable to synthesize pha anaerobically and instead produced glycogen and polyphosphate in situ kristiansen et al 2012 and dapos could also achieve simultaneous removal of nitrogen and phosphorus therefore coexistence of tetrasphaera candidatus accumulibacter and dpaos as dominant paos benefit enhanced bnpr meanwhile the post anoxic unit in the treatment system can further enhance the nitrogen removal efficiency by providing dgaos with a low carbon and low oxygen environment conducive to endogenous denitrification in addition the relative abundance of dgaos gradually increased and the phosphorus removal efficiency was not negatively affected with the decrease in the orp of the anaerobic unit the relative abundance of tetrasphaera as paos increased through denitrifying phosphorus removal and endogenous denitrification to enhance bnpr notably previous studies showed that an anaerobic unit orp 200 mv was conducive to tetrasphaera growth barnard et al 2017 previous studies also indicated that setting the side stream anaerobic reactor known as the s2ebpr system can reduce the orp in the anaerobic unit and the dominant paos were transformed from the traditional candidatus accumulibacter to tetrasphaera which could effectively perform ebpr wang et al 2019 however the mean anaerobic unit orp in this study could reach 79 mv by setting a post anoxic unit which is far from the deep anaerobic conditions conducive to tetrasphaera growth therefore it is inferred that deep anaerobic conditions are not the only conditions that promote tetrasphaera growth this study proved that tetrasphaera can grow even under an orp of 100 mv of the anaerobic unit in future studies on tetrasphaera we should consider the more extensive orp of the anaerobic unit after all evidence points to an inability of most conventional ebpr plants to reduce the orp to below 200 mv barnard et al 2017 similarly the influent organic matter concentration and composition and the interaction between microbial communities should also be considered to further reveal the suitable growth environment of tetrasphaera 5 conclusions the novel a2o a mbr process has promising prospects for obtaining advanced nitrogen and phosphorus removal in mainstream wastewater treatment plants denitrifying phosphorus removal and endogenous denitrification could be enhanced by increasing the volume of the anoxic unit and maintaining a suitable mixed liquor recycling rate the anoxic unit plays a crucial role in the community regulation of paos dpaos and dgaos among which the fermentative ability of the pao genus tetrasphaera has a stronger phosphorus release efficiency and the synergistic effect of dpaos and dgaos is crucial for enhancing bnpr this study could add insight into applying a novel internal recycling system based on a post anoxic process for upgrading the

15248,cooperating in harmony to avoid competition with dominant functional microbial symbiosis is an efficient way in advanced nitrogen and phosphorus removal in wastewater treatment processes in this study a niche based coordinating strategy was implemented to cooperate in harmony with phosphorus accumulating organisms paos denitrifying phosphorus accumulating organisms dpaos and denitrifying glycogen accumulating organisms dgaos to advance nitrogen and phosphorus removal based on an anaerobic anoxic oxic anoxic membrane bioreactor a2o a mbr under low c n in municipal wastewater influent the niche based strategy was conducted based on the orp change during the process as an indicator combined with the adjustment of recirculation and anoxic zone shifting the results indicated that the strategy of the post anoxic unit could enable significant enhancement of biological nitrogen and phosphorus removal bnpr by 9 9 and 16 3 respectively with low effluent concentrations of 7 0 2 2 mg n l and 0 36 0 32 mg p l the satisfactory performance was dominated along with the shift in the microbial community the relative abundance of tetrasphaera pao genus increased from 0 14 0 08 to 0 32 0 12 while the relative abundance of decchloromonas dgao genus and candidatus competibacter dgao genus also increased the advanced combination of anaerobic phosphorus release anoxic denitrification denitrifying phosphorus removal and endogenous denitrification was qualified by the modeling simulation of the biochemical kinetics mechanism of activated sludge in the a2o mbr and a2o a mbr processes which means that cooperation in the harmony of paos dpaos and dgaos could be efficiently realized by a promising control strategy to enhance bnpr in an a2o mbr with a post anoxic unit this study provides an efficient and simple novel control strategy to overcome the limitation of traditional nitrogen and phosphorus removal under an insufficient carbon source graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords functional microbial symbiosis advanced nitrogen and phosphorus removal denitrifying phosphorus removal endogenous denitrification tetrasphaera data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction excessive discharge of nitrogen and phosphorus is the main cause of eutrophication so advanced nitrogen and phosphorus removal in wastewater is urgent conley et al 2009 hautier et al 2014 currently discharge quality standards of wastewater treatment plants wwtps are generally becoming increasingly more stringent to reduce the emissions of nitrogen and phosphorus however deeper levels of nitrogen and phosphorus removal are challenging because of insufficient influent carbon sources for biological nitrogen and phosphorus removal bnpr in conventional processes gong et al 2020 wang et al 2022a wang et al 2022 zhao et al 2018 many previous studies have proven that the conflict of achieving simultaneous removal of nitrogen and phosphorus in municipal sewage with low c n ratio as shown in table 1 so it is necessary to improve the wastewater treatment process and optimize the operation condition to regulate the functional bacteria in the bnpr process the coexistence of several key organograms namely phosphorus accumulating organisms paos and denitrifying glycogen accumulating organisms dgaos and denitrifying ordinary heterotrophic organisms play critical roles in the enhanced bnpr but their competition for organic matter leads to contradictions in wastewater with a low c n ratio in the conventional enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr process denitrifying ordinary heterotrophic organisms compete with paos for carbon sources in the influent with low c n ratio resulting in poor nitrogen and phosphorus removal performance yang et al 2010 in the anaerobic and aerobic stages dgaos utilize a similar metabolism as paos but they do not accumulate polyphosphate tu and schuler 2013 past studies have focused on how to inhibit the growth of dgaos to further ebpr processes or to inhibit the growth of paos and selectively strengthen dgaos to achieve advanced nutrient removal via endogenous denitrification dan et al 2021 wang et al 2021a when paos and dgaos coexist how they can play their respective roles rather than inhibit each other remains largely unknown the emergence of innovative biological phosphorus removal strategies may solve this contradiction among microorganisms for example denitrifying phosphorus accumulating organisms dpaos and side stream enhanced biological phosphorus removal s2ebpr processes fu et al 2019 marques et al 2018 wang et al 2019a especially dpaos for enhanced bnpr effects are particularly significant a recent study showed that anoxic conditions may be an implementable strategy for maintaining denitrifying phosphorus removal performance in wwtps sun et al 2020 zaman et al 2021 found that dpaos had a competitive advantage over nitrite oxidizing bacteria for nitrite consumption and played a vital role in simultaneous denitrification and phosphorus removal at low do 0 3 0 05 mg l for treating carbon limited municipal wastewater additionally paos tetrasphaera with fermentation capability were found and fernando et al 2019 showed that tetrasphaera contributed to phosphorus removal as much as or more than the conventional candidatus accumulibacter in 8 danish wwtps many studies have also reported the synergistic effect of paos dpaos and dgaos to achieve advanced nitrogen and phosphorus removal but most of them were conducted by using synthetic wastewater or laboratory scale sequencing batch reactor where activities of paos dpaos and dgaos can be easily regulated ji et al 2020 lu et al 2022 wang et al 2021b wu et al 2021 it remains to be further explored how paos dpaos and dgaos play their respective roles rather than inhibit each other in full scale wwtps with the continuous push flow in particular it is still not clear what conditions are favorable for a stable denitrifying phosphorus removal and endogenous denitrification process because paos dpaos and dgaos would compete for the limit carbon source the mbr membrane bioreactor process is considered a promising wastewater treatment strategy huang et al 2010 xiao et al 2019 main highlights of mbr technology include small footprint high effluent quality complete separation of hydraulic retention time hrt and solids retention time srt etc however conventional mbr has poor phosphorus removal efficiency due to the sludge with higher dissolved oxygen do concentration returned from the membrane tank and long srt different studies have suggested that the removal efficiency of tp was 43 5 and 56 in different full scale mbrs respectively falahti marvast and karimi jashni 2015 hu et al 2014 metal salt induced phosphorus precipitation and enhanced microbial processes are two alternatives for overcoming poor phosphorus removal however the added metal salts exhibited a more significant contribution to membrane fouling than biopolymers for example iron to phosphorus molar ratio of 1 4 when iron trichloride is added which will produce serious irreversible membrane fouling asif et al 2021 lyko et al 2007 zhang et al 2015 therefore how to promote the harmonious symbiosis of paos dpaos and dgaos in mbr process is more promising as a limitation of the traditional understanding of nitrogen and phosphorus removal to cooperate in harmony to avoid the competition of the different highly efficient dominant functional microbial symbioses on advanced nitrogen and phosphorus removal a niche based coordinating strategy to cooperate in harmony with paos dpaos and dgaos to advance nitrogen and phosphorus removal was proposed based on an anaerobic anoxic oxic anoxic membrane bioreactor a2o a mbr with low c n in the influent the niche based strategy adopted the orp change throughout the process as an indicator combined with adjusting the recirculation reflux ratio sludge concentration and setting of the post anoxic unit to assess the contribution of each tank to nitrogen and phosphorus removal the conversion and synergistic effects of denitrifying ordinary heterotrophic organisms paos dpaos and dgaos were investigated on a pilot scale of the a2o mbr process with real municipal wastewater the mechanisms of enhanced bnpr were assessed by the developed model of phosphorus release denitrifying phosphorus removal and endogenous denitrification in the a2o a mbr process 16s rrna high throughput technology was used to track the bacterial community structures during operation these novel insights into microbial symbiosis hopefully will provide important guidance for advanced nitrogen and phosphorus removal 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater source seed sludge and experimental setup the a2o a mbr was fed settled primary municipal wastewater with a cod of 170 2 42 2 mg l tp of 4 1 1 1 mg l and tn of 42 3 8 2 mg n l the pilot scale plant was seeded with activated sludge from a full scale membrane bioreactor treating domestic wastewater chengdu sichuan china the pilot scale a2o a mbr plant length width height 6000 mm 2000 mm 1000 mm thickness 6 mm effective volume of 10 m3 consisted of an 8 m3 a2o bioreactor tank anaerobic unit 0 83 m3 anoxic unit 3 33 m3 oxic unit 4 17 m3 and a 1 67 m3 membrane bioreactor unit meanwhile the membrane bioreactor unit and oxic unit were aerated at a flow rate of 10 l min to alleviate membrane fouling by a blower the suction pump was operated in a timing sequence which consisted of an 8 min switch on and a 2 min switch off the total net filtration flux was maintained at 12 l m2 h resulting in an hrt of 13 9 h and a daily treatment capacity of 17 3 m3 transmembrane pressure tmp was measured by a pressure transmitter and recorded automatically the weekly membrane maintenance cleaning was performed using backflush with citric acid 0 2 solution and naclo 0 005 solution in sequence through the membrane and the cleaning intensity for each solution was 1 7 l m2 membrane when the operation was terminated at tmp of 50 kpa membranes were sequentially soaked in the solutions of citric acid 2 and naclo 0 05 for 16 h respectively to facilitate nutrient removal the reactor was provided with three internal recyclings irs and the internal recycling ratio irr was calculated where ir1 connects the membrane bioreactor unit and oxic unit to provide sludge and part of oxygen to oxic unit ir2 connects the oxic unit and anoxic unit to provide sludge to anoxic unit for denitrification and ir3 connects the anoxic unit and anaerobic unit to provide sludge to anaerobic unit for the release of phosphorus anaerobic anoxic and oxic units were provided with a low speed mixer to keep the mixed liquid suspended solid mlss in suspension 2 2 operation conditions and monitoring the a2o a mbr was operated for 400 days consisting of four phases fig 1 and its detailed operations are described in table 2 1 phase i days 0 71 the pilot scale a2o mbr plant was operated as described above during which irr 350 irr2 350 and irr3 350 until the effluent quality and mlss were observed to stabilize phase i served as the baseline period 2 phase ii days 72 120 the pilot scale a2o mbr plant was operated as in phase i but irr3 was adjusted to enhance the biological phosphorus removal efficiency during the operation of phase ii irr3 was reduced to 150 the new irr was selected based on the high orp value of the anaerobic unit in phase i which led to poor biological phosphorus efficiency in the pilot scale plant wilfert et al 2015 x zhang et al 2020 3 3 phase iii day 121 211 the aeration in the t6 tank of the aerobic unit of the pilot scale plant was stopped and adjusted to the post anoxic unit which was selected based on the concentration changes of tn tp ammonia and nitrate in the t1 t7 tanks of phase ii fig s1 to achieve advanced nitrogen and phosphorus removal based on denitrifying phosphorus removal and endogenous denitrification therefore the pilot scale plant was the a2o a mbr process in phase iii and ir2 connected the post anoxic unit and anoxic unit 4 phase iv days 212 400 the operation of the pilot scale a2o a mbr plant was consistent with phase iii under the condition that the effective volume of the pilot scale plant remained unchanged with some modifications the volume of t5 in the oxic unit was reduced and the volume of t6 in the post anoxic unit was increased through the movable baffle between tank t5 and tank t6 to further increase the hrt of the post anoxic unit it was also selected based on the concentration changes of tn tp ammonia and nitrate in the t1 t7 tanks in phase iii fig s1 to further improve the efficiency of bnpr in all phases approximately 500 l d of mixed liquor was discharged in the pilot scale plant srt 20 2 d and the influent and effluent tn tp cod ammonium nitrite and nitrate concentrations were measured three times a week in the t1 t7 tanks of the pilot scale plant the do orp ph temperature values and mlss concentrations along the way were measured three times a week and the concentration changes of tn tp cod ammonium nitrite and nitrate in each tank along the way were measured every two weeks the activated sludge samples of 50 ml mixed liquor were collected each week using sterile centrifuge tubes and then concentrated at 10 000 rpm for 10 min finally the supernatant was removed with a pipette and anhydrous ethanol was added to 50 ml and stored in a 20 c refrigerator for microbial community profiling 2 3 model development to evaluate the experimental data in phase i and phase iv 1000 ml of mixed liquor was collected from the membrane bioreactor in the pilot scale plant and the activated sludge was washed three times and then diluted with real municipal wastewater to 1000 ml regaining the mlss concentration after anaerobic stirring phosphorus release for 120 min the anoxic uptake phosphorus stage proceeded with an initial nitrate concentration of 15 mg n l continuing for 120 min the ph was controlled at 7 5 0 1 to avoid chemical phosphorus precipitation the concentrations of tp nitrate and nitrite in the mixed liquor were measured after membrane 0 45 μm filtration every 30 min during the batch test operation the endogenous denitrification performance of activated sludge was measured a total of 1000 ml of mixed liquor was collected from the membrane bioreactor in the pilot scale plant and the activated sludge was washed three times after replacing the supernatant of the samples with 1 phosphate buffered saline small amounts of nitrite as nano3 were added anoxic stirring was performed for 3 h and liquid samples were taken every 30 min the concentrations of nitrate and cod were measured after membrane 0 45 μm filtration based on nitrogen and phosphorus transformations during the tests a phosphorus release denitrification phosphorus removal and endogenous denitrification model was developed rieger et al 2001 liu et al 2015 the model kinetics and stoichiometry as well as component definitions and parameter values used in the model are summarized in tables s1 3 the estimation was performed in aquasim 2 1 and parameter values were estimated by minimizing the sum of squares of the deviations of the model predictions from the measured data reichert 1998 and calibrating three key parameter values i e the anoxic growth rate of heterotrophs μh the anoxic growth rate of dpaos on nitrate μdpao and the rate constant for storage of xpha qpha 2 4 microbial community analysis to investigate the variations in the microbial community sludge samples were collected from the bioreactor during pilot testing days 44 65 77 105 188 238 323 348 373 389 for 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing the homogeneous mixtures of sludge samples collected from different positions of the biosensor were stored immediately at 80 until dna extraction the extracted dna was the template for pcr amplification targeting the v4 region of the 16s rrna gene using the universal primers 515f 5 gtgccagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and 806r 5 ggactacvsgggtatctaat 3 and the amplicons were sequenced on a miseq platform according to standard protocols the raw dna sequence data were analysed with default settings using quantitative insights into microbial ecology qiime pipeline version 1 7 0 http qiime org the sequences were trimmed step by step including the removal of primers and sequences 300 bp and then assigned to each sample based on their barcodes finally the trimmed sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units otus using a 97 cut off 2 5 chemical analysis and calculations tn tp cod ammonium nitrite nitrate and mlss in influent effluent and mixed liquor samples were determined with standard methods ministry of environmental protection 2006 the temperature orp ph and do were automatically recorded using a multimeter hach hq30d to understand the mechanism of tp and tn removal a mass balance was performed for tp and tn the mass balance was conducted using the equation 1 mas s in mas s removed mas s out where mass in is the amount of lead entering the system mg h mass removal is the amount of lead removed in the unit mg h and mass out is the amount of lead leaving the system mg h the above equation was implemented for the a2o a mbr system and the removal contribution of tp and tn in each unit was evaluated according to the equations derived from the schematic of the system fig s2 the calculation equations for the removal contributions of nitrogen and phosphorus for individual tanks are described in section 2 of the supplementary materials 3 results 3 1 performance of the pilot scale a2o a mbr plant 3 1 1 performance of nutrients removal the nitrogen phosphorus and cod removal performance of the pilot scale a2o a mbr process is shown in fig 2 the average concentration of influent ammonia nitrogen was 29 0 3 6 n mg l and the effluent was mainly nitrate with ammonia 1 n mg l and nitrite 0 2 n mg l which validated the satisfactory nitrification of the plant fig 2a the average concentrations of effluent tn were 11 6 2 5 mg n l 10 9 1 9 mg n l 6 9 2 8 mg n l and 7 0 2 2 mg n l in phases i iv respectively and the average tn removal efficiencies were 77 5 4 6 78 5 5 4 86 1 6 1 and 88 4 7 6 respectively fig 2e moreover the average concentration of influent tp was 4 1 1 1 p mg l the average concentrations of effluent tp were 0 96 0 68 and 0 97 0 64 p mg l in phases i ii and the average tp removal efficiency was 76 3 16 6 and 75 3 16 0 respectively however with the addition of post anoxic units in phases iii iv the average concentrations of effluent tp were 0 30 0 16 and 0 36 0 32 p mg l and the average tp removal efficiency increased to 91 3 5 4 and 91 7 7 6 respectively this result suggests that the a2o a mbr process was more conducive to enhancing bnpr than the traditional a2o mbr process without adding additional chemical reagents to remove phosphorus the average concentration of influent cod was 170 2 42 2 mg l the effluent cod was 20 mg l and the removal generally remained higher than 90 throughout the operational process 3 1 2 operational parameter characteristics of do orp ph and temperature alternate anaerobic anoxic oxic processes are considered an effective way to acclimate nitrifiers denitrifiers and paos merzouki et al 1999 notably recent studies iannacone et al 2020 li et al 2020 have found that dpaos can also be enriched in alternate anaerobic anoxic oxic processes therefore do is crucial for nitrogen and phosphorus removal the do of the oxic unit t4 t6 and the membrane bioreactor unit t7 gradually increased in phases i ii and the do mean values of phase ii were 2 9 4 4 5 6 and 6 4 mg l respectively in phases iii iv tank 6 in the oxic unit was adjusted to the post anoxic unit the do mean values of t4 t7 were 4 0 2 0 1 1 and 5 9 mg l in phase iv and t6 was significantly lower than that in phases i ii fig 3a the results showed that lower do may be more effective for ebpr performance which is consistent with the results in the literature izadi et al 2020 zeng et al 2002 the orp of the anaerobic unit is also crucial for ebpr x zhang et al 2020 indicated that regulating orp could enhance the function of denitrifying phosphorus accumulating bacteria and obtained the best denitrifying phosphorus absorbing effect when the orp setting value was 95 mv in the anaerobic stage and preanoxic stage as shown in fig 3b the orp mean values of the anaerobic unit t1 gradually decreased from 25 6 mv in phase i to 78 0 mv in phase iv because of the change in the internal recycling ratio between the anoxic unit and anaerobic unit in phase ii as well as the subsequent adjustment of the post anoxic unit in phases iii iv the orp mean values were 35 7 mv and 19 8 mv in the post anoxic unit respectively in this pilot scale a2o a mbr process study the performance of nitrogen and phosphorus removal throughout the operation also proved that adjusting the anaerobic unit orp can enhance bnpr the ph range of the anaerobic unit anoxic unit oxic unit post anoxic unit and membrane bioreactor unit was 7 4 7 5 the ph range of 7 8 was suitable for nitrification and denitrification and the accumulation of phosphorus by paos sedlak 1991 the removal of nitrogen through ammonia stripping will be negligible below ph 9 5 dawson and murphy 1972 therefore functional bacteria almost dominate the removal of nitrogen and phosphorus throughout the pilot scale process temperature also has a significant effect on the activity of microorganisms in general their activity will increase with temperature until reaching a maximum rate after which inhibition occurs liu et al 2020 this pilot scale a2o a mbr process was operated to treat real municipal wastewater at a wide seasonal temperature change from 13 to 28 c fig 3d the effluent concentrations of tn and tp remained below 10 mg n l and 0 5 mg p l respectively when the temperature dropped from 25 c to 12 c in phase iii and increased back to 25 c in phase iv which also proved the feasibility of a2o a mbr in municipal wastewater treatment over a wide seasonal temperature change to enhance bnpr 3 2 fate of nitrogen and phosphorus throughout the process 3 2 1 fate of nitrogen as shown in fig 4 the nitrogen mass balance of the pilot scale plant during phases i iv was calculated in terms of the measured flow rates internal recycling ratio and tn and ammonia concentrations in each tank in phase i more than 80 of tn was removed in the anoxic unit 95 of the nitrate was removed in the anoxic unit and the contribution of the aerobic unit to the removal of nh4 n reached 100 in phase ii the contribution of anaerobic units to the removal of tn nh4 n and no3 n increased however the tn removal efficiency did not significantly improve in phases iii iv the post anoxic unit was added and the contribution to tn removal increased with increasing volume of the post anoxic unit in phases iv in addition to exogenous denitrification and denitrifying phosphorus removal in the anoxic zone endogenous denitrification also occurred in the post anoxic zone which together contributed to the improvement of tn efficiency based on the mass balance calculation the contribution of endogenous denitrification to tn removal efficiency was 11 3 in phase iv in phase ii and iv do was 5 6 mg l and 1 1 mg l in the t6 resulting in that the do introduced to anoxic unit was 3 56 mg l and 0 55 mg l respectively 5 6 3 5q q 1 5q 3 5q according to the aerobic catabolism equation of cod c6h12o6 6o2 6co2 6h2o energy calculates that about 3 3 mg l and 0 51 mg l cod is consumed in the anoxic unit which is equivalent to the anoxic unit in phase iv can increase the removal of nitrate by 0 8 mg n l however the tn removal in phase iv increased by nearly 4 mg n l compared with that in phase ii so denitrifying phosphorus removal and endogenous denitrification are essential to enhance the nitrogen removal efficiency dpaos and dgaos can conduct denitrification by oxidizing anaerobically accumulated phas to provide energy for glycogen resynthesis and cell growth under anoxic conditions in addition endogenous organic substrates degrade more slowly than exogenous soluble biodegradable organic matter and thus can maintain durable reducing power for denitrification miao et al 2016 the above results indicated that endogenous denitrification driven by dpaos and or dgaos was the dominant nitrogen removal pathway for the post anoxic unit 3 2 2 fate of phosphorus as shown in fig 4 in phases i ii most of the tp was removed by paos in the oxic unit as previously described the paos could not obtain enough organic carbon sources for the release of phosphorus and the synthesis of pha which leads to the deterioration of phosphorus uptake in the anoxic and oxic units in phases iii iv the post anoxic unit promoted the anoxic unit to become the dominant unit for phosphorus removal especially in phase iv and the contribution of the anoxic unit to tp removal reached 65 5 clearly with increasing post anoxic volume the denitrifying phosphorus removal was enhanced the cod concentration was always below 30 mg l in the post anoxic unit which facilitated the occurrence of denitrifying phosphorus removal by using pha as an electron donor hu et al 2002 this result indicated that dpaos play a determining role in the ebpr of the a2o a mbr pilot scale process 3 3 model evaluation of denitrifying phosphorus removal and endogenous denitrification batch tests were performed in phases i and iv to monitor the changes in pao dpao and gao activities in the a2o mbr and a2o a mbr processes the nitrate and phosphorus profiles predicted with the established model are illustrated in fig 5 a b along with the experimental results the model simplifies phosphorus release and uptake without model calibration for changes in pha and glycogen during anaerobic anoxic processes after 2 h of anaerobic phosphorus release nitrate was added to initiate denitrifying phosphorus removal using stored pha by dpaos during the anoxic stage the anaerobic phosphorus release rate in phase i was much lower than that in phase iv and the developed model fitting estimated the qpha of paos in phases i and iv as 9 32 d 1 and 32 64 d 1 respectively this result indicated that the decrease of orp in the anaerobic unit is beneficial to the release of phosphorus in phase iv in the anoxic stage the removal effect of nitrogen and phosphorus in phase iv was better than that in phase i and the model fitting estimated the anoxic growth rate of heterotrophs and the anoxic growth rate of dpaos in phase i μh 8 41 d 1 μdpao 0 22 d 1 and phase iv μh 3 83 d 1 μdpao 7 33 d 1 respectively in addition the endogenous denitrification efficiency was higher in phase iv fig 5c these results indicated that anaerobic phosphorus release denitrifying phosphorus removal and endogenous denitrification were enhanced in the a2o a mbr process and dgaos dpaos and paos can coexist to promote advanced nitrogen and phosphorus removal 3 4 microbial community analysis to further understand the microbial functional mechanism of dgaos paos dpaos and nitrifiers to enhance bnpr the microbial community distribution at the phylum and genus levels was characterized fig 6 most bacteria were classified into proteobacteria and bacteroidetes at the phylum level fig 6a accounting for 54 2 67 3 of the total bacteria this result showed good agreement with previous studies indicating its widespread abundance in full scale wwtps cao et al 2020 the relative abundances of dgaos paos dpaos and nitrifiers at the genus level are shown in fig 6b candidatus competibacter defluviicoccus and propionivibrio belong to dgaos dan et al 2021 and the relative abundance of defluviicoccus and propionivibrio was consistently lower than 0 1 candidatus competibacter was the dominant dgao during the operation and accomplished the endogenous denitrification process with self synthetic endogenous pha consumption the relative abundance of candidatus competibacter was 0 11 0 04 in the a2o mbr process and it increased to 0 25 0 09 in the a2o a mbr process this result might explain the contribution of the post anoxic unit to nitrate removal under the condition of almost no external carbon source candidatus accumulibacter and tetrasphaera have been identified as paos in several previous studies liu et al 2019 marques et al 2018 although tetrasphaera does not store pha compared to candidatus accumulibacter it can better take up complex organic molecules such as amino acids and glucose in the a2o a mbr process the relative abundance of tetrasphaera increased from 0 14 0 08 to 0 32 0 12 and that of candidatus accumulibacter decreased from 0 9 0 43 to 0 61 0 33 it should be noted that although the increase of the relative abundance of tetrasphaera was beneficial to ebpr the relative abundance of candidatus accumulibacter was always higher than tetrasphaera during the operation and the oxic and anoxic phosphorus removal of candidatus accumulibacter could not be neglected although the relative abundance of paos did not change significantly as the orp of the anaerobic unit gradually decreased the proportion of tetrasphaera in paos gradually increased which will be further discussed in section 4 2 dechloromonas pseudomonas acinetobacter aeromonas and flavobacterium were detected in typical dpaos wu et al 2021 in which decchloromonas was always the dominant dpao during the operation in the a2o a mbr process the relative abundance of decchloromonas was 0 92 0 21 which was mainly responsible for the removal of no3 n and po4 3 p in the anoxic unit furthermore nitrifiers with the representative genera nitrosomonas 0 13 0 02 and nitrospira 1 34 0 37 were detected during the operation the results indicated that dgaos paos and dpaos coexisted in the a2o a mbr process to synergistically remove tn and tp which ensured the good stability of the combined process 4 discussion 4 1 dpaos and dgaos synergistically promote the advanced nitrogen and phosphorus removal of wastewater with a low c n ratio many previous studies have demonstrated that the deterioration of ebpr in the wastewater treatment process is due to the proliferation of dgaos which can perform carbon conversions in a similar way to paos without contributing to phosphorus uptake and release shen et al 2017 and that inhibition of dgaos can increase the activity of paos carvalheira et al 2014 especially in the operation mode of mbr few studies have reported that paos dpaos and dgaos cooperate harmoniously to achieve advanced nitrogen and phosphorus removal shown in table 1 however most indicated that the removal efficiencies of tp and tn were difficult to reach 80 simultaneously in previous studies on advanced nitrogen and phosphorus removal dgaos and dpaos were considered to be able to achieve simultaneous endogenous denitrification and denitrifying phosphorus removal as well for dgaos post anoxic denitrification and low do are the main drivers of endogenous denitrification gao et al 2020 winkler et al 2011 for dpaos the most of existing denitrifying phosphorus removal were composed of dual sludge system such as anaerobic anoxic nitrification sequencing batch reactor aan sbr wang et al 2009 aao biological aerated filter aao baf chen et al 2011 because the dual sludge system can effectively solve the conflict of different srt between nitrifying bacteria and dpaos in addition influent with lower c n ratio shortening oxic phase hrt and prolonging anoxic phase hrt also stimulated the growth of dpaos mandel et al 2019 x zhang et al 2020 however most of the reports on synergistic symbiosis of dpaos and dgaos mainly have been carried out under ideal experimental control conditions by lab scale reactor or synthetic wastewater conditions this study for the first time demonstrated the key factors of paos dpaos and dgaos symbiosis in pilot scale a2o a mbr process in a single sludge system to achieve advanced nitrogen and phosphorus removal under actual municipal wastewater influent of low c n this study also showed that lengthening the volume of anoxic unit and shortening the volume of oxic unit could enhance denitrifying phosphorus removal the post anoxic unit also provided favorable conditions for the growth of dgaos because the external carbon source was almost depleted in post anoxic unit and dgaos would consume their own phb to provide energy for the denitrification and glycogen synthesis therefore setting up the post anoxic unit is conducive to the growth of dpaos and dgaos as the main phosphorus removal pathway denitrifying phosphorus removal can also have an ebpr effect without affecting the removal of tn as described in section 3 2 1 post anoxic unit can avoid the loss of 2 8 mg lcod in the anoxic zone which is equivalent to improving the no3 n removal efficiency of 0 8 mg n l however according to the quantitative results the effect of do on tn removal efficiency only accounts for about 1 5 and the remaining effect of tn removal efficiency is mainly due to denitrifying phosphorus removal and endogenous denitrification anaerobic zone and absence of do are defined by low orp the orp is positively correlated with do and no3 n which further indicates that lower no3 n and do lead to lower orp an estimated orp of 200mv will lead to higher phosphorus release from paos or dpaos resulting in greater subsequent aerobic phosphorus uptake vaiopoulou and aivasidis 2008 diaz et al 2022 in this study although the adjusted post anoxic unit reduced the orp in the anaerobic unit 79 mv it was also well below the ideal value which we speculate may be related to the emergence of the novel paos genus tetrasphaera with fermentation capability as will be discussed further in section 4 2 this study indicated that post anoxic promotes endogenous denitrification and further promotes lower do and no3 n returned to the anaerobic unit by internal recycling which is conducive to the release and uptake of phosphorus therefore regulating orp and do in anaerobic anoxic and oxic tanks to promote the synergistic effect of endogenous denitrification and denitrifying phosphorus removal and thus improve the efficiency of conventional bnpr will be the focus of future research in addition the average values of mlss for each unit t1 t7 in a2o a mbr process were 3 8 5 8 5 9 6 8 6 9 6 8 and 8 1 g l which were all lower than the mlss of each unit in the a2o mbr process the observed sludge yield yobs was calculated according to he et al 2021 and the results showed that denitrifying phosphorus removal and endogenous denitrification in the a2o a mbr process were conducive to sludge reduction fig s3 4 2 tetrasphaera and dpaos can effectively enhance carbon source utilization enhancing carbon source utilization when paos tetrasphaera and dgaos coexist and providing dgaos with a low carbon source and low do environment conducive to achieving endogenous denitrification are key to enhanced bnpr as shown in fig 7 in this study when the relative abundance of tetrasphaera and dpaos was increased the use of carbon sources could be enhanced to promote nitrogen and phosphorus removal because tetrasphaera seemed unable to synthesize pha anaerobically and instead produced glycogen and polyphosphate in situ kristiansen et al 2012 and dapos could also achieve simultaneous removal of nitrogen and phosphorus therefore coexistence of tetrasphaera candidatus accumulibacter and dpaos as dominant paos benefit enhanced bnpr meanwhile the post anoxic unit in the treatment system can further enhance the nitrogen removal efficiency by providing dgaos with a low carbon and low oxygen environment conducive to endogenous denitrification in addition the relative abundance of dgaos gradually increased and the phosphorus removal efficiency was not negatively affected with the decrease in the orp of the anaerobic unit the relative abundance of tetrasphaera as paos increased through denitrifying phosphorus removal and endogenous denitrification to enhance bnpr notably previous studies showed that an anaerobic unit orp 200 mv was conducive to tetrasphaera growth barnard et al 2017 previous studies also indicated that setting the side stream anaerobic reactor known as the s2ebpr system can reduce the orp in the anaerobic unit and the dominant paos were transformed from the traditional candidatus accumulibacter to tetrasphaera which could effectively perform ebpr wang et al 2019 however the mean anaerobic unit orp in this study could reach 79 mv by setting a post anoxic unit which is far from the deep anaerobic conditions conducive to tetrasphaera growth therefore it is inferred that deep anaerobic conditions are not the only conditions that promote tetrasphaera growth this study proved that tetrasphaera can grow even under an orp of 100 mv of the anaerobic unit in future studies on tetrasphaera we should consider the more extensive orp of the anaerobic unit after all evidence points to an inability of most conventional ebpr plants to reduce the orp to below 200 mv barnard et al 2017 similarly the influent organic matter concentration and composition and the interaction between microbial communities should also be considered to further reveal the suitable growth environment of tetrasphaera 5 conclusions the novel a2o a mbr process has promising prospects for obtaining advanced nitrogen and phosphorus removal in mainstream wastewater treatment plants denitrifying phosphorus removal and endogenous denitrification could be enhanced by increasing the volume of the anoxic unit and maintaining a suitable mixed liquor recycling rate the anoxic unit plays a crucial role in the community regulation of paos dpaos and dgaos among which the fermentative ability of the pao genus tetrasphaera has a stronger phosphorus release efficiency and the synergistic effect of dpaos and dgaos is crucial for enhancing bnpr this study could add insight into applying a novel internal recycling system based on a post anoxic process for upgrading the

15249,several studies have been conducted on nanoplastics nps however few studies have investigated the complexity of the interactions between nps and other aqueous pollutants in multi solute media in this study the adsorption of polystyrene nanoplastics psnps on magnetic materials ms in the presence of available nitrogen an was studied the results demonstrated that the adsorbed amount of psnps increased in the presence of ammonium nitrogen nh 4 n whereas no significant difference was detected on the adsorbed amount of psnps using nitrate nitrogen no 3 n as a cosolute the increase in the adsorbed amount of psnps was attributed to the formation of an ms psnps nh 4 n complex scanning electron microscopy sem x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and zeta potential analyses indicated that the psnps with nh 4 n as a cosolute can be bound on the ms surfaces moreover the change in the psnps amount adsorbed by ms depends on the valence state electronegativity of the coexisting ions and the surface properties and functional groups of psnps additionally the ionic strength dissolved organic matter solution ph metal cations and the subsequent release of ms coated psnps and nh 4 n changed considerably in different aquatic systems and artificial nitrating fluids among different natural aquatic systems the psnps adsorption on ms was excellent in lake water the results indicate high potential for the attachment of psnps to ms in the presence of an and further deepen the understanding of removing nps using magnetic materials in aqueous systems with various coexisting contaminants

1 introduction the extensive application of plastic products in our daily life and the industry causes large amounts of plastic particles to be released into the environment yang et al 2019 chen et al 2023 in aquatic systems plastics are broken down into smaller particles which are called microplastics mps 0 1 5 mm or nanoplastics nps 100 nm using physical chemical and biological treatments zhang et al 2020 cai et al 2021 among them nps which have at least one dimension with a size 100 nm have attracted global concern as emerging pollutants li et al 2021a ding et al 2020 globally nps have been found in different environments such as sediments lakes and oceans wang et al 2020 wu et al 2019 cui et al 2022 wang et al 2018 nanoplastics have been proven to be widely distributed and could lead to suffocation internal injuries and physiological disorders in aquatic organisms singh et al 2021 wang et al 2021c therefore investigating the removal of nps in polluted aqueous systems is particularly important among different pollutants treatment methods the adsorbent based adsorption process is widely used due to its simplicity cost effectiveness and high efficiency tang et al 2021 shen et al 2022 xue et al 2021a magnetic materials mms as typical adsorbent materials are highly popular and can be used in contaminant removal nawaz et al 2021 tan et al 2022 owing to their large specific surface area high adsorption capacity and magnetic characteristics ye et al 2021 shi et al 2022 previous researches have confirmed that mms can adsorb with some pollutants and considerably affect the migration and removal of contaminants in aqueous solutions tan et al 2022 ye et al 2021 recently several studies have indicated that mms considerably affect the mobility and transport of nps and electrostatic attraction electron donor receptor interaction and complexation play fundamental roles the aggregation and removal of nps wang et al 2021b singh et al 2021 for example tong et al 2020 confirmed that plastic particles with different size could be attached to a magnetite surface via electrostatic force singh et al 2021 synthesised a magnetic adsorbent which could effectively capture nps with varying surface functionalities moreover these studies demonstrated that iron oxide plays a vital role in the removal of nps and the interactions between plastic particles and mms considerably affect nps transport and immobilization behaviours in porous media tang et al 2021 zhao et al 2022 additionally plastic particles could adsorb and transport other pollutants in aqueous solutions zhou et al 2022 chen et al 2023 for instance xue et al 2021b found that cu ii and tetracycline could be adsorbed on polyurethane mps further increasing their possible synergistic virulence tang et al 2021 discovered the pb ii uptake onto nylon mps that caused a change in the charge of mps surfaces the environmental behaviour and surface characteristics of mps nps are affected by the addition of coexisting pollutants li et al 2020 kim et al 2021 besides the heteroaggregation of nanoparticles occurs owing to the existence of other non plastic particles parsai and kumar 2020 dong and zhou 2020 which further influence the attachment of nps on mms however limited information is available about multi pollutant interaction between nps and other water borne pollutants on mms generally plastic pollution is often accompanied by other pollutants xue et al 2021b ding et al 2020 the interactions between nps and these coexisting solutes in aqueous systems could significantly impact the migration and removal of nps ho and leung 2021 wang et al 2021a nitrogen is widely found in aqueous systems and can cause eutrophication of water bodies at higher concentrations and interaction with other pollutants can cause a more serious water contamination further leading to the death of aquatic organisms wei et al 2022 ren et al 2021 moreover because of the large specific surface area and abundant functional groups of nps they can interact with several contaminants and be affected by other constituents of the aquatic environment sun et al 2021 arenas et al 2021 in previous studies mms have exhibited excellent adsorption ability of nps and available nitrogen an through charge neutralisation and electrostatic attraction respectively after attaching to these pollutants liu et al 2021a b however most studies focused on the interaction between ms and a single pollutant therefore understanding the multi pollutant interactions among nps mms and an in multi solute systems is crucial currently the widely existing forms of an in the water environment are mainly nitrate nitrogen no 3 n and ammonium nitrogen nh 4 n these forms are abundant and stay in in the water system for long durations wei et al 2022 previous studies have confirmed that a high abundance of mps can be observed together with high levels of an in the same water environment chen et al 2023 besides no 3 n and nh 4 n were observed on the mp particle surfaces in adsorption tests therefore both the no 3 n and nh 4 n was selected as the coexisting pollutants in the multi solute system moreover the magnetic substances ms as adsorbents in this study were prepared using a coprecipitation method the major objective of this study was to understand the interactions between ms and psnps in the presence of an the adsorption capacity of ms towards nps in the presence of an was investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and reagents the yellow green fluorescent labelled polystyrene nanoplastics psnps 80 nm were acquired from zhengzhou feynman biotechnology co ltd china zhengzhou moreover the no 3 n and nh 4 n used in the experiment were prepared from sodium nitrate nano3 99 and ammonium chloride nh4cl 99 respectively obtained from sigma aldrich houston tx us sodium chloride nacl 99 and dissolved organic matter dom were procured from sigma aldrich independent reserve solutions of metal ions cu pb cd and zn were prepared in ultrapure water the components of the digestive juice such as sodium taurocholate and pepsin were purchased from shanghai ekear bio tech co ltd china shanghai ms 0 5 2 μm were prepared by using a coprecipitation method and the preparation processes are detailed in the supporting information si the chemical components of ms are mainly fe3o4 68 3 al2o3 12 6 and sio2 11 3 which have strong magnetism properties fig s1 2 2 characterisation of the samples field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem s 4800 hitachi limited japan was used to visualize the attachment of psnps on the surface of ms in the presence of an the samples were sprayed with gold after adsorption for the sem tests the surface functional groups of ms with an as the cosolute were examined via x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps leybold heraeus china before and after adsorption the hydrodynamic diameter and zeta potential of psnps were estimated using a nano laser particle size analyser zen3600 malvern instruments limited uk the oxides contained in ms were detected by using x ray fluorescence spectroscopy xrf zsxprimusⅱ rigaku japan 2 3 multi solute adsorption of the psnps and an on ms the psnps solution was sonicated for 30 min before the batch adsorption test next ms 5 mg were added to a conical flask containing a 10 ml suspension of psnps aqueous solution 5 mg l fig s2 the mass concentrations of psnps used in this study were based on earlier adsorption experiments with different psnps concentrations from which the lowest possible psnps concentrations were selected different types of an solutions were added in the sample mixtures to achieve a final concentration of 10 200 mg l the sample mixtures were systematically shaken at 180 rpm in the dark at 25 c for 12 h to reach equilibrium fig s3 after the reaction the suspensions of the mixtures were centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 30 min subsequently the supernatant was extracted and sonicated for 5 min to keep the remaining psnps uniformly dispersed in the water system next the mixed solutions were passed a 0 22 μm polyamide membrane filter the concentrations of the residual psnps and an in the supernatants were then determined the psnps concentrations were determined using a fluorescence spectrophotometer rf 7000 shimadzu japan at an ex and an em of 488 and 516 nm respectively the an nh 4 n and no 3 n concentrations were detected using a continuous flow analyser xy 2 sampler seal analytical uk the effects of the solution ph metal ions ionic strength and dom on the psnps ms an interactions were investigated the concentrations of psnps and an were set at 5 and 30 mg l respectively the role of the solution ph was investigated by adjusting the ph value to 3 2 5 1 7 and 9 2 in aqueous solutions polluted by heavy metals the contents of cadmium cd zinc zn lead pb and copper cu are high moreover such solutions have strong toxicity and can destroy the ecological balance therefore were selected to estimate the effects of coexisting metal ions on the attachment of psnps on ms the effects of the ionic strength and dom were studied by varying the nacl and humic acid mass concentrations 0 01 0 02 0 05 0 1 0 2 0 5 and 1 mg l the initial ph values of the solution were adjusted using hcl and naoh solutions 0 1 m each the multi contaminant interactions among psnps ms and an were investigated in different types of water bodies the an concentrations of the water samples i e tap water domestic sewage from the region of northwest a f university wei river water yangling china and luyang lake water weinan china were 1 23 2 94 3 81 and 3 23 mg l respectively then different amounts of psnps were added into the mixture solutions in order that the psnps concentration reaches 5 mg l the properties of the different water bodies are listed in table s1 2 4 desorption experiment desorption experiments can evaluate the attachment effect of psnps on ms and afford better understanding of the removal of psnps in multi solute systems liu et al 2020 therefore multiple in vitro digestion models were used to simulate the in vitro digestive system at different nutritional levels and desorption capacity of the ms with adsorbed pollutants was analysed the detailed information of the experimental steps and results are presented in si 2 5 quality control and statistical analysis all adsorption and desorption tests were conducted in triplicate and the experimental blanks were used when it was required to reveal the vital function of the interactions among psnps ms and an glassware was used in all adsorption experiments to avoid plastic pollution the standard variance was calculated via descriptive statistics using the spss 24 0 software and the figures were drawn using origin 2019b all adsorption experiments were conducted at ph 7 and a temperature of 25 c unless mentioned otherwise the derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory was employed to reveal the potential interaction between ms and psnps in multi solute system the detailed calculation equations are provided in si equation 1 represents the mass conservation equation of the adsorption of pollutants on ms 1 q e c 0 c e v m where c 0 and c e are the initial and adsorption saturation concentrations of the pollutants respectively v is the volume of the mixed solution ml and m is the dosage of the adsorbent mg 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorption of psnps on ms in the presence of no 3 n and nh 4 n the psnps amount adsorbed on ms increased with the increase in the psnps concentration fig s2 because of the electrostatic attraction between psnps and the iron oxide functional groups singh et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 in an aqueous solution with a ph of 7 both ms 8 1 mv and psnps 25 5 mv were negatively charged fig s4 and the electrostatic repulsion increased between the isotropic charged particles therefore the adsorbed amount of psnps was low no considerable differences were observed among the hydrodynamic diameters d h of psnps and the amounts of psnps absorbed on ms q e with no 3 n as a cosolute in the multi solute system even though part of psnps was attached on the ms particles fig 1 similarly the attachment of psnps by ms with the multi solute nh 4 n 30 mg l was in agreement with that of the no 3 n as a cosolute the adsorbed amount of ms on psnps decreased slightly but no significant difference was observed a small amount of psnps on ms can be attributed to the hydrodynamic bridging and straining of these particles torkzaban et al 2015 moreover based on the dlvo theory the energy barrier of these particles rises fig s5 which could further reduce the heteroaggregation of psnps conversely both d h and q e of the psnps adsorption on ms increased with the increase in the nh 4 n concentration 30 mg l in the test media fig 1d e the synergistic adsorption of psnps on ms in the presence of nh 4 n instead of no 3 n can be attributed to the difference in their charge characteristics several studies have reported that oppositely charged develop on a material surface when it combines with oppositely charged ions which could promote the interaction between substances with similar charges through ion bridging ho and leung 2021 abraham et al 2001 therefore the study assume that nh 4 n is preferentially adsorbed on the surface of ms in multi solute media and then binds with the psnps with negatively charged through cation bridging leading to the formation of ms an psnps complexes however this is impossible for no 3 n owing to its negatively charged surface moreover the increase in the electrostatic repulsion was found to improve the stability of the multi solute medium clearly a higher increase in the psnps adsorption on ms was observed in the presence of nh 4 n than that in the presence of no 3 n in the multi solute media fig 1 the results indicated that the complexation of ms psnps and an were not completely controlled by the attachment of cations on the ms surfaces first the ms an interactions were markedly different for nh 4 n and no 3 n due to their have oppositely charged the nh 4 n provides stronger surface electrostatic force for subsequent interactions with psnps furthermore the psnps aggregation behaviour was markedly affected by the presence of nh 4 n impacting the adsorption of psnps on the ms surfaces recent studies suggest that the aggregation of nps via the addition of appositely charged ions in aqueous solution which can be attributed to the repulsive force between ms decreased through charge screening or charge neutralisation singh et al 2019 li et al 2021a second the interactions between the iron oxide functional groups on the ms surface and nh 4 n were distinct and can be observed in this study in the increasing zeta potentials of these particles and the higher q e of nh 4 n fig s5c 1e additionally the surface roughness and chemical heterogeneity of ms should be considered in their complex interaction with psnps several studies have demonstrated the increasing spatial variability in charge and microscopic surface roughness which could reduce the dlvo interaction energy barrier and provide favourable attachment sites on net electrostatically unfavourable surface conditions bradford et al 2018 bradford and torkzaban 2013 shen et al 2018 the electrostatic repulsion between the two isotropic charged particles was reduced in the presence of nh 4 n which further enhanced the attachment of psnps on ms both the psnps and ms had negative zeta potentials which could produce high energy barrier to hinder their attachment with the an concentration 30 mg l fig s5 however nh 4 n employed in multi solute systems could form an attractive surface via van der waals interactions and the repulsion force between psnps and ms could be weakened zhang et al 2019 bradford and torkzaban 2013 according to the dlvo theory the presence of nh 4 n was more efficient than that of no 3 n in decreasing the debye length and thus in decreasing the energy barrier for ms psnps attachment smith 2016 dong and zhou 2020 the nps aggregation could be enhanced because the energy barrier decreaseed in cosolute nh 4 n media promoting the interaction between ms and psnps li et al 2021b thus it can be concluded that the ms bound to psnps due to the van der waals interactions even though the adsorption capacity of ms was not significant moreover the interaction between psnps nh 4 n complexes and negatively charged psnps through ion bridging is potential these complexation interactions considerably depend on the adsorbed mass the zeta potential of the cations on the psnps surface and the surface roughness and chemically heterogeneity of ms 3 2 analysis of complexation mechanisms of ms an psnps the attachment of psnps and nh 4 n as a cosolute to the ms surface was further verified via sem analysis fig 2 a shows that ms had a porous and rough surface structure and the xrf confirmed that large amounts of iron oxide covered the ms surface table s1 indicating that psnps can be bound via van der waals or electrostatic attraction clearly psnps adhered to the ms surfaces with nh 4 n as a cosolute rather than with no 3 n which was less abundant and compact fig 3 shows the surface characteristics of psnps before and after adsorption with nh 4 n as the cosolute additionally the ms psnps composite was examined to gain insights into the ms psnps complexation mechanism the three major binding energies fe2p c1s and o1s of ms considerably changed indicating that the interaction occurs between psnps and ms in the presence of nh 4 n fig 3a the n1s characteristic peak was observed in the full spectrum fig 3b suggesting that nh 4 n was also adsorbed on the ms surface which further verifies the complex interaction among ms an and psnps the dominant c and o functional groups were further studied to explore the interaction mechanisms between ms and the pollutants as shown in fig 3c three main peaks of fe2p were observed i e fe3o4 fe2o3 and fe0 at 710 9 713 6 and 718 6 ev respectively after the psnps adsorption on ms in the presence of nh 4 n moreover the binding energies of ms decreased by a factor of 0 41 0 99 and 6 29 ev respectively the results demonstrated that the fe o group considerably affect the adhesion of psnps to ms through electrostatic attraction singh et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 three peaks of c1s were observed in the xps spectra of ms fig 3d which could be attributed to the c c c o and π π transition corresponding to the binding energies of 284 9 288 2 and 291 7 ev respectively after the attachment of psnps on ms the binding energies of the three characteristic peaks decreased by 1 1 3 72 and 3 39 ev respectively and a new c h peak occurred at 285 6 ev generally polystyrene plastic is a polymer composed of aromatic c h functional groups zhang et al 2020 therefore the reduction in the peak intensities of c c c o and π π in ms after the psnps adsorption confirmed the role of the cation π and complexation interactions in the adsorption of an on ms shen et al 2021 altenburger et al 2018 moreover four characteristic peaks i e fe o fe ooh c o and oh were observed in o1s fig 3e and their energies decreased by 0 14 0 6 0 7 and 0 02 ev respectively indicating that iron oxide functional groups showed an important role in the psnps removal the hydrophobic interaction can generally promote the aggregation of nonpolar compounds in aqueous systems and causes various colloidal phenomena jiang et al 2017 as a hydrophobic polymer polystyrene is prone to clustering together through hydrophobic interactions in aqueous media faghihnejad and zeng 2012 and conducive for enhancing the interaction with ms under the nh 4 n as a cosolute furthermore the hydrophobic interactions can be adjusted by tuning the surface nanoscale structure and chemistry of polystyrene xie et al 2020 these results implied that the an psnps interactions on ms are controlled by different adsorption mechanisms furthermore the surface charge of psnps became more positive in the multi solute media because of the introduction of nh 4 n which affords an advanced electrostatic interaction with ms the results indicated that nh 4 n can be adsorbed on psnps because of its residual charge density magid et al 2021 in summary these findings confirm that the adsorption of psnps on ms increases in the presence of nh 4 n as a cosolute in multi solute systems 3 3 environmental factors affecting the psnps adsorption on ms with nh 4 n the aforementioned findings confirmed that ms has a tendency for psnps uptake which increases with the increase in the nh 4 n uptake in aquatic solutions however the complexation interactions of ms psnps and an are still not well studied therefore investigating the effects of different environmental factors such as ionic strength dom solution ph and divalent metal cations on the adsorption of psnps with nh 4 n as a cosolute by ms is necessary 3 3 1 effect of the ionic strength fig 4 a c show the d h and amount of psnps adsorbed on ms with nh 4 n as a cosolute as a function of the nacl concentration a significant difference was observed among the d h values of psnps moreover the d h value of psnps gradually increased with the increase in the ionic strength fig 4a indicating that the addition of nacl has a considerable effect on the aggregation behaviour of psnps and that it could be complexed with nh 4 n this observation corresponds well to the result of zhang et al 2020 the results indicated that na and nh 4 n cations promote aggregation via charge neutralisation or shielding which may attributed to the repulsive double layer reduction based on the decreased energy barrier li et al 2020 therefore the stability was reduced in multi solute media leading to the existence of cation based nanoparticles that aggravated the aggregation and sedimentation of psnps lin et al 2021 the q e value of psnps adsorption on ms with nh 4 n as a cosolute increased with the increase in the nacl concentration fig 4b whereas the adsorption amount of nh 4 n did not exhibit any major difference fig 4c which can be attributed to the large amounts of psnps on the ms surface this promoting effect of nacl on the psnps adhesion is explained by the following points i in the initial state nh 4 n was first adsorbed on ms whereas a small amount of psnps was adsorbed on the ms with the increase in the nacl concentration the effective sites available for pollutant adsorption on the surface of ms decreased in the multi nh 4 n solution this corresponds to the trend of the q e value of psnps at higher nacl concentrations in other words at higher nacl concentrations more psnps bound nh 4 n were available for complexation interactions with ms through ion bridging ii the charge of the nh 4 n captured by psnps and ms were neutralised by the enhanced ionic strength causing a reduction in the electrostatic repulsion of these particles li et al 2021a zhang et al 2020 thus the nh 4 n coated psnps and ms have better complexation interactions in multi solute media with a monovalent electrolyte as a result of bridging adsorption and charge neutralisation schubert et al 2019 ho and leung 2021 3 3 2 effect of dom the d h value and cumulative mass of psnps adsorbed on ms in the presence of nh 4 n are illustrated in fig 4d f as a function of dom concentrations the d h values of psnps with different dom concentrations were lack of markedly difference fig 4d indicating that the aggregation state of psnps was hardly affected by the addition of dom and that its effect exceeds the cosolute effect of nh 4 n moreover the q e value of psnps adsorbed on ms in the presence of nh 4 n as a cosolute decreased with the increase in the dom concentration and the adsorbed amount of psnps decreased from 2 61 to 0 2 mg g fig 4e whereas there was no remarkable difference in the adsorption amount of nh 4 n fig 4f these results revealed that the addition of dom could significantly inhibit the attachment of psnps several previous studies have demonstrated that dom was readily adsorbed on mms or nanoparticles leading to neutralisation and even reversal of the surface charge of colloids aiken et al 2011 lee et al 2005 chen et al 2023 therefore the attachment of psnps on ms decreased because the complexation rate of dom was much higher than that of nh 4 n in multi solute systems moreover the aggregation of the nanoparticles in the suspensions treated with dom decreased thereby the deposition of nanoparticles in saturated porous media was inhibited singh et al 2019 wu et al 2019 particularly the zeta potential of ms decreased with dom addition fig s6 which was dramatically correlated with the reduction in psnps attachment this is ascribed to the enhanced electrostatic repulsion and steric effect between ms and psnps upon dom addition because dom was loaded on the surface of ms or psnps which yielded changed surface properties wu et al 2018 wang et al 2016 at high dom concentrations few nh 4 n coated psnps surfaces were useful for the subsequent complexation of ms via bridging effect which could be attributed to the charge neutralisation of the inversely charged dom and nh 4 n tan et al 2019 moreover the steric repulsion of dom to psnps was stronger than the nh 4 n bridging effect additionally the electric double layers of ms bound psnps and nh 4 n were compressed because of the increase in the concentration of dom causing a reduction in the surface electrostatic potential of these samples lee et al 2021 as proved by a reduction in the zeta potential fig s6 3 3 3 effect of ph the adsorbed amounts of psnps on ms in the presence of nh 4 n significantly decreased at high ph values which is reflected in the massive decrease in the ms adsorption capacity from 8 56 to 1 4 mg g with the increasing ph from 3 2 to 9 2 respectively fig 5 b however the d h values of psnps exhibited a downward trend with increasing ph values fig 5a which reflects a reduction in the agglomeration of psnps in alkaline environments due to the electronegativity of the psnps surfaces zhou et al 2020 moreover the q e values of nh 4 n exhibited no significant difference at different d h values fig 5c thus the solution ph plays a crucial role in the attachment of psnps the decrease in psnps adsorption on ms at high ph values can be ascribed to the reduction in the electrostatic attraction between ms and psnps with the increase in the solution ph and the psnps can be maintained in a stable state because of the increase in the hydroxide ions wang et al 2021b zhou et al 2022 therefore few nh 4 n bound psnps surfaces were available for the subsequent interactions with ms under neutral and alkaline conditions moreover direct interactions between ms and psnps possibly occurred under acidic conditions because of the electrostatic attraction between ms and psnps particles 3 3 4 effect of metal cations the aggregation and adsorption amount of psnps by ms were markedly affected by the addition of different types of metal cations to multi solute solutions fig 5d f indicate that both the d h and q e values of psnps varied significantly with different metal ions and the order of their effect on the adsorption of psnps on ms is as follows cu ii pb ii zn ii cd ii fig 5e moreover the d h change of psnps was consistent with the influence order of the metal ions on psnps adsorption capacity fig 5d cu ii exhibited a stronger affinity for psnps adsorption sites than pb ii zn ii and cd ii thus the q e values of nh 4 n decreased in the multi solute system with the four metal cations fig 5f this result can be mainly attributed to the stronger electrostatic interactions between psnps and the four metal ions which affords an increase the metallic electronegativity with the increase in the ionic radius the complexation effect of metal cations with psnps was stronger than that of nh 4 n huang et al 2020 wang et al 2017 moreover high q e values of psnps were observed with the addition of metal cations because of the increase in the available sites and the strong attraction forces between ms and psnps the aggregation behavior and colloidal stability of psnps were changed by the cosolute and cations which is reflected in the increase in the d h values these results can be attributed to the hydrolysis ability electronegativity and hydration radius of the metal ions ho and lenug 2021 lópez et al 2020 concisely the metal ions bind more easily to psnps which can be ascribed to the schulze hardy rule schulze 1882 hardy 1900 therefore the adsorbed amount of psnps on ms increased because the psnps clusters are easily adsorbed in the existence of multivalent metal ions 3 4 adsorption in complex aqueous matrices after clarifying the interaction mechanism between ms and psnps in the presence of nh 4 n the interactions among the four substances were examined in actual environmental samples i e tap water domestic sewage river water and lake water the adsorbed amounts of psnps on ms in the presence of nh 4 n in the different media were in the following order lake water domestic sewage river water tap water fig 6 a and b which can be attributed to the high ionic strength of lake water followed by domestic sewage river water and tap water table s1 although both domestic sewage and river water had high ph values the removal efficiency of nh 4 n in domestic sewage river water and lake water can reach over 90 fig 6b the psnps removal from tap water was poorer from than the other samples possibly because no interactions occurred between the anions no3 and po4 3 and ms these results indicated that different ions in the aqueous solution can considerably interfere with the adsorption of psnps on ms in the presence of nh 4 n li et al 2021 4 conclusions natural water environment is a complex system and often contain various pollutants this study investigated the complexation interactions among ms psnps and nh 4 n in a multi solute medium the results indicate that a significant amount of psnps can be adsorbed on the surface of ms with nh 4 n as a cosolute through complexation and ion bridging the adsorption amount of psnps on the ms surface depends on the valence state and electronegativity of the coexisting ions and the surface structure and functional groups of psnps moreover the ms psnps nh 4 n complex formation was facilitated in monovalent electrolyte solutions which was attributed to the charge neutralisation effect the actual environmental sample experiment revealed that the adsorption of psnps on ms is the highest in lake water systems these findings revealed the critical role of nh 4 n in the adsorption of psnps on ms and demonstrated the considerable impact of psnps adsorption on ms with or without nh 4 n on the fate and uptake of psnps the

15249,several studies have been conducted on nanoplastics nps however few studies have investigated the complexity of the interactions between nps and other aqueous pollutants in multi solute media in this study the adsorption of polystyrene nanoplastics psnps on magnetic materials ms in the presence of available nitrogen an was studied the results demonstrated that the adsorbed amount of psnps increased in the presence of ammonium nitrogen nh 4 n whereas no significant difference was detected on the adsorbed amount of psnps using nitrate nitrogen no 3 n as a cosolute the increase in the adsorbed amount of psnps was attributed to the formation of an ms psnps nh 4 n complex scanning electron microscopy sem x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and zeta potential analyses indicated that the psnps with nh 4 n as a cosolute can be bound on the ms surfaces moreover the change in the psnps amount adsorbed by ms depends on the valence state electronegativity of the coexisting ions and the surface properties and functional groups of psnps additionally the ionic strength dissolved organic matter solution ph metal cations and the subsequent release of ms coated psnps and nh 4 n changed considerably in different aquatic systems and artificial nitrating fluids among different natural aquatic systems the psnps adsorption on ms was excellent in lake water the results indicate high potential for the attachment of psnps to ms in the presence of an and further deepen the understanding of removing nps using magnetic materials in aqueous systems with various coexisting contaminants

1 introduction the extensive application of plastic products in our daily life and the industry causes large amounts of plastic particles to be released into the environment yang et al 2019 chen et al 2023 in aquatic systems plastics are broken down into smaller particles which are called microplastics mps 0 1 5 mm or nanoplastics nps 100 nm using physical chemical and biological treatments zhang et al 2020 cai et al 2021 among them nps which have at least one dimension with a size 100 nm have attracted global concern as emerging pollutants li et al 2021a ding et al 2020 globally nps have been found in different environments such as sediments lakes and oceans wang et al 2020 wu et al 2019 cui et al 2022 wang et al 2018 nanoplastics have been proven to be widely distributed and could lead to suffocation internal injuries and physiological disorders in aquatic organisms singh et al 2021 wang et al 2021c therefore investigating the removal of nps in polluted aqueous systems is particularly important among different pollutants treatment methods the adsorbent based adsorption process is widely used due to its simplicity cost effectiveness and high efficiency tang et al 2021 shen et al 2022 xue et al 2021a magnetic materials mms as typical adsorbent materials are highly popular and can be used in contaminant removal nawaz et al 2021 tan et al 2022 owing to their large specific surface area high adsorption capacity and magnetic characteristics ye et al 2021 shi et al 2022 previous researches have confirmed that mms can adsorb with some pollutants and considerably affect the migration and removal of contaminants in aqueous solutions tan et al 2022 ye et al 2021 recently several studies have indicated that mms considerably affect the mobility and transport of nps and electrostatic attraction electron donor receptor interaction and complexation play fundamental roles the aggregation and removal of nps wang et al 2021b singh et al 2021 for example tong et al 2020 confirmed that plastic particles with different size could be attached to a magnetite surface via electrostatic force singh et al 2021 synthesised a magnetic adsorbent which could effectively capture nps with varying surface functionalities moreover these studies demonstrated that iron oxide plays a vital role in the removal of nps and the interactions between plastic particles and mms considerably affect nps transport and immobilization behaviours in porous media tang et al 2021 zhao et al 2022 additionally plastic particles could adsorb and transport other pollutants in aqueous solutions zhou et al 2022 chen et al 2023 for instance xue et al 2021b found that cu ii and tetracycline could be adsorbed on polyurethane mps further increasing their possible synergistic virulence tang et al 2021 discovered the pb ii uptake onto nylon mps that caused a change in the charge of mps surfaces the environmental behaviour and surface characteristics of mps nps are affected by the addition of coexisting pollutants li et al 2020 kim et al 2021 besides the heteroaggregation of nanoparticles occurs owing to the existence of other non plastic particles parsai and kumar 2020 dong and zhou 2020 which further influence the attachment of nps on mms however limited information is available about multi pollutant interaction between nps and other water borne pollutants on mms generally plastic pollution is often accompanied by other pollutants xue et al 2021b ding et al 2020 the interactions between nps and these coexisting solutes in aqueous systems could significantly impact the migration and removal of nps ho and leung 2021 wang et al 2021a nitrogen is widely found in aqueous systems and can cause eutrophication of water bodies at higher concentrations and interaction with other pollutants can cause a more serious water contamination further leading to the death of aquatic organisms wei et al 2022 ren et al 2021 moreover because of the large specific surface area and abundant functional groups of nps they can interact with several contaminants and be affected by other constituents of the aquatic environment sun et al 2021 arenas et al 2021 in previous studies mms have exhibited excellent adsorption ability of nps and available nitrogen an through charge neutralisation and electrostatic attraction respectively after attaching to these pollutants liu et al 2021a b however most studies focused on the interaction between ms and a single pollutant therefore understanding the multi pollutant interactions among nps mms and an in multi solute systems is crucial currently the widely existing forms of an in the water environment are mainly nitrate nitrogen no 3 n and ammonium nitrogen nh 4 n these forms are abundant and stay in in the water system for long durations wei et al 2022 previous studies have confirmed that a high abundance of mps can be observed together with high levels of an in the same water environment chen et al 2023 besides no 3 n and nh 4 n were observed on the mp particle surfaces in adsorption tests therefore both the no 3 n and nh 4 n was selected as the coexisting pollutants in the multi solute system moreover the magnetic substances ms as adsorbents in this study were prepared using a coprecipitation method the major objective of this study was to understand the interactions between ms and psnps in the presence of an the adsorption capacity of ms towards nps in the presence of an was investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and reagents the yellow green fluorescent labelled polystyrene nanoplastics psnps 80 nm were acquired from zhengzhou feynman biotechnology co ltd china zhengzhou moreover the no 3 n and nh 4 n used in the experiment were prepared from sodium nitrate nano3 99 and ammonium chloride nh4cl 99 respectively obtained from sigma aldrich houston tx us sodium chloride nacl 99 and dissolved organic matter dom were procured from sigma aldrich independent reserve solutions of metal ions cu pb cd and zn were prepared in ultrapure water the components of the digestive juice such as sodium taurocholate and pepsin were purchased from shanghai ekear bio tech co ltd china shanghai ms 0 5 2 μm were prepared by using a coprecipitation method and the preparation processes are detailed in the supporting information si the chemical components of ms are mainly fe3o4 68 3 al2o3 12 6 and sio2 11 3 which have strong magnetism properties fig s1 2 2 characterisation of the samples field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem s 4800 hitachi limited japan was used to visualize the attachment of psnps on the surface of ms in the presence of an the samples were sprayed with gold after adsorption for the sem tests the surface functional groups of ms with an as the cosolute were examined via x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps leybold heraeus china before and after adsorption the hydrodynamic diameter and zeta potential of psnps were estimated using a nano laser particle size analyser zen3600 malvern instruments limited uk the oxides contained in ms were detected by using x ray fluorescence spectroscopy xrf zsxprimusⅱ rigaku japan 2 3 multi solute adsorption of the psnps and an on ms the psnps solution was sonicated for 30 min before the batch adsorption test next ms 5 mg were added to a conical flask containing a 10 ml suspension of psnps aqueous solution 5 mg l fig s2 the mass concentrations of psnps used in this study were based on earlier adsorption experiments with different psnps concentrations from which the lowest possible psnps concentrations were selected different types of an solutions were added in the sample mixtures to achieve a final concentration of 10 200 mg l the sample mixtures were systematically shaken at 180 rpm in the dark at 25 c for 12 h to reach equilibrium fig s3 after the reaction the suspensions of the mixtures were centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 30 min subsequently the supernatant was extracted and sonicated for 5 min to keep the remaining psnps uniformly dispersed in the water system next the mixed solutions were passed a 0 22 μm polyamide membrane filter the concentrations of the residual psnps and an in the supernatants were then determined the psnps concentrations were determined using a fluorescence spectrophotometer rf 7000 shimadzu japan at an ex and an em of 488 and 516 nm respectively the an nh 4 n and no 3 n concentrations were detected using a continuous flow analyser xy 2 sampler seal analytical uk the effects of the solution ph metal ions ionic strength and dom on the psnps ms an interactions were investigated the concentrations of psnps and an were set at 5 and 30 mg l respectively the role of the solution ph was investigated by adjusting the ph value to 3 2 5 1 7 and 9 2 in aqueous solutions polluted by heavy metals the contents of cadmium cd zinc zn lead pb and copper cu are high moreover such solutions have strong toxicity and can destroy the ecological balance therefore were selected to estimate the effects of coexisting metal ions on the attachment of psnps on ms the effects of the ionic strength and dom were studied by varying the nacl and humic acid mass concentrations 0 01 0 02 0 05 0 1 0 2 0 5 and 1 mg l the initial ph values of the solution were adjusted using hcl and naoh solutions 0 1 m each the multi contaminant interactions among psnps ms and an were investigated in different types of water bodies the an concentrations of the water samples i e tap water domestic sewage from the region of northwest a f university wei river water yangling china and luyang lake water weinan china were 1 23 2 94 3 81 and 3 23 mg l respectively then different amounts of psnps were added into the mixture solutions in order that the psnps concentration reaches 5 mg l the properties of the different water bodies are listed in table s1 2 4 desorption experiment desorption experiments can evaluate the attachment effect of psnps on ms and afford better understanding of the removal of psnps in multi solute systems liu et al 2020 therefore multiple in vitro digestion models were used to simulate the in vitro digestive system at different nutritional levels and desorption capacity of the ms with adsorbed pollutants was analysed the detailed information of the experimental steps and results are presented in si 2 5 quality control and statistical analysis all adsorption and desorption tests were conducted in triplicate and the experimental blanks were used when it was required to reveal the vital function of the interactions among psnps ms and an glassware was used in all adsorption experiments to avoid plastic pollution the standard variance was calculated via descriptive statistics using the spss 24 0 software and the figures were drawn using origin 2019b all adsorption experiments were conducted at ph 7 and a temperature of 25 c unless mentioned otherwise the derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory was employed to reveal the potential interaction between ms and psnps in multi solute system the detailed calculation equations are provided in si equation 1 represents the mass conservation equation of the adsorption of pollutants on ms 1 q e c 0 c e v m where c 0 and c e are the initial and adsorption saturation concentrations of the pollutants respectively v is the volume of the mixed solution ml and m is the dosage of the adsorbent mg 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorption of psnps on ms in the presence of no 3 n and nh 4 n the psnps amount adsorbed on ms increased with the increase in the psnps concentration fig s2 because of the electrostatic attraction between psnps and the iron oxide functional groups singh et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 in an aqueous solution with a ph of 7 both ms 8 1 mv and psnps 25 5 mv were negatively charged fig s4 and the electrostatic repulsion increased between the isotropic charged particles therefore the adsorbed amount of psnps was low no considerable differences were observed among the hydrodynamic diameters d h of psnps and the amounts of psnps absorbed on ms q e with no 3 n as a cosolute in the multi solute system even though part of psnps was attached on the ms particles fig 1 similarly the attachment of psnps by ms with the multi solute nh 4 n 30 mg l was in agreement with that of the no 3 n as a cosolute the adsorbed amount of ms on psnps decreased slightly but no significant difference was observed a small amount of psnps on ms can be attributed to the hydrodynamic bridging and straining of these particles torkzaban et al 2015 moreover based on the dlvo theory the energy barrier of these particles rises fig s5 which could further reduce the heteroaggregation of psnps conversely both d h and q e of the psnps adsorption on ms increased with the increase in the nh 4 n concentration 30 mg l in the test media fig 1d e the synergistic adsorption of psnps on ms in the presence of nh 4 n instead of no 3 n can be attributed to the difference in their charge characteristics several studies have reported that oppositely charged develop on a material surface when it combines with oppositely charged ions which could promote the interaction between substances with similar charges through ion bridging ho and leung 2021 abraham et al 2001 therefore the study assume that nh 4 n is preferentially adsorbed on the surface of ms in multi solute media and then binds with the psnps with negatively charged through cation bridging leading to the formation of ms an psnps complexes however this is impossible for no 3 n owing to its negatively charged surface moreover the increase in the electrostatic repulsion was found to improve the stability of the multi solute medium clearly a higher increase in the psnps adsorption on ms was observed in the presence of nh 4 n than that in the presence of no 3 n in the multi solute media fig 1 the results indicated that the complexation of ms psnps and an were not completely controlled by the attachment of cations on the ms surfaces first the ms an interactions were markedly different for nh 4 n and no 3 n due to their have oppositely charged the nh 4 n provides stronger surface electrostatic force for subsequent interactions with psnps furthermore the psnps aggregation behaviour was markedly affected by the presence of nh 4 n impacting the adsorption of psnps on the ms surfaces recent studies suggest that the aggregation of nps via the addition of appositely charged ions in aqueous solution which can be attributed to the repulsive force between ms decreased through charge screening or charge neutralisation singh et al 2019 li et al 2021a second the interactions between the iron oxide functional groups on the ms surface and nh 4 n were distinct and can be observed in this study in the increasing zeta potentials of these particles and the higher q e of nh 4 n fig s5c 1e additionally the surface roughness and chemical heterogeneity of ms should be considered in their complex interaction with psnps several studies have demonstrated the increasing spatial variability in charge and microscopic surface roughness which could reduce the dlvo interaction energy barrier and provide favourable attachment sites on net electrostatically unfavourable surface conditions bradford et al 2018 bradford and torkzaban 2013 shen et al 2018 the electrostatic repulsion between the two isotropic charged particles was reduced in the presence of nh 4 n which further enhanced the attachment of psnps on ms both the psnps and ms had negative zeta potentials which could produce high energy barrier to hinder their attachment with the an concentration 30 mg l fig s5 however nh 4 n employed in multi solute systems could form an attractive surface via van der waals interactions and the repulsion force between psnps and ms could be weakened zhang et al 2019 bradford and torkzaban 2013 according to the dlvo theory the presence of nh 4 n was more efficient than that of no 3 n in decreasing the debye length and thus in decreasing the energy barrier for ms psnps attachment smith 2016 dong and zhou 2020 the nps aggregation could be enhanced because the energy barrier decreaseed in cosolute nh 4 n media promoting the interaction between ms and psnps li et al 2021b thus it can be concluded that the ms bound to psnps due to the van der waals interactions even though the adsorption capacity of ms was not significant moreover the interaction between psnps nh 4 n complexes and negatively charged psnps through ion bridging is potential these complexation interactions considerably depend on the adsorbed mass the zeta potential of the cations on the psnps surface and the surface roughness and chemically heterogeneity of ms 3 2 analysis of complexation mechanisms of ms an psnps the attachment of psnps and nh 4 n as a cosolute to the ms surface was further verified via sem analysis fig 2 a shows that ms had a porous and rough surface structure and the xrf confirmed that large amounts of iron oxide covered the ms surface table s1 indicating that psnps can be bound via van der waals or electrostatic attraction clearly psnps adhered to the ms surfaces with nh 4 n as a cosolute rather than with no 3 n which was less abundant and compact fig 3 shows the surface characteristics of psnps before and after adsorption with nh 4 n as the cosolute additionally the ms psnps composite was examined to gain insights into the ms psnps complexation mechanism the three major binding energies fe2p c1s and o1s of ms considerably changed indicating that the interaction occurs between psnps and ms in the presence of nh 4 n fig 3a the n1s characteristic peak was observed in the full spectrum fig 3b suggesting that nh 4 n was also adsorbed on the ms surface which further verifies the complex interaction among ms an and psnps the dominant c and o functional groups were further studied to explore the interaction mechanisms between ms and the pollutants as shown in fig 3c three main peaks of fe2p were observed i e fe3o4 fe2o3 and fe0 at 710 9 713 6 and 718 6 ev respectively after the psnps adsorption on ms in the presence of nh 4 n moreover the binding energies of ms decreased by a factor of 0 41 0 99 and 6 29 ev respectively the results demonstrated that the fe o group considerably affect the adhesion of psnps to ms through electrostatic attraction singh et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 three peaks of c1s were observed in the xps spectra of ms fig 3d which could be attributed to the c c c o and π π transition corresponding to the binding energies of 284 9 288 2 and 291 7 ev respectively after the attachment of psnps on ms the binding energies of the three characteristic peaks decreased by 1 1 3 72 and 3 39 ev respectively and a new c h peak occurred at 285 6 ev generally polystyrene plastic is a polymer composed of aromatic c h functional groups zhang et al 2020 therefore the reduction in the peak intensities of c c c o and π π in ms after the psnps adsorption confirmed the role of the cation π and complexation interactions in the adsorption of an on ms shen et al 2021 altenburger et al 2018 moreover four characteristic peaks i e fe o fe ooh c o and oh were observed in o1s fig 3e and their energies decreased by 0 14 0 6 0 7 and 0 02 ev respectively indicating that iron oxide functional groups showed an important role in the psnps removal the hydrophobic interaction can generally promote the aggregation of nonpolar compounds in aqueous systems and causes various colloidal phenomena jiang et al 2017 as a hydrophobic polymer polystyrene is prone to clustering together through hydrophobic interactions in aqueous media faghihnejad and zeng 2012 and conducive for enhancing the interaction with ms under the nh 4 n as a cosolute furthermore the hydrophobic interactions can be adjusted by tuning the surface nanoscale structure and chemistry of polystyrene xie et al 2020 these results implied that the an psnps interactions on ms are controlled by different adsorption mechanisms furthermore the surface charge of psnps became more positive in the multi solute media because of the introduction of nh 4 n which affords an advanced electrostatic interaction with ms the results indicated that nh 4 n can be adsorbed on psnps because of its residual charge density magid et al 2021 in summary these findings confirm that the adsorption of psnps on ms increases in the presence of nh 4 n as a cosolute in multi solute systems 3 3 environmental factors affecting the psnps adsorption on ms with nh 4 n the aforementioned findings confirmed that ms has a tendency for psnps uptake which increases with the increase in the nh 4 n uptake in aquatic solutions however the complexation interactions of ms psnps and an are still not well studied therefore investigating the effects of different environmental factors such as ionic strength dom solution ph and divalent metal cations on the adsorption of psnps with nh 4 n as a cosolute by ms is necessary 3 3 1 effect of the ionic strength fig 4 a c show the d h and amount of psnps adsorbed on ms with nh 4 n as a cosolute as a function of the nacl concentration a significant difference was observed among the d h values of psnps moreover the d h value of psnps gradually increased with the increase in the ionic strength fig 4a indicating that the addition of nacl has a considerable effect on the aggregation behaviour of psnps and that it could be complexed with nh 4 n this observation corresponds well to the result of zhang et al 2020 the results indicated that na and nh 4 n cations promote aggregation via charge neutralisation or shielding which may attributed to the repulsive double layer reduction based on the decreased energy barrier li et al 2020 therefore the stability was reduced in multi solute media leading to the existence of cation based nanoparticles that aggravated the aggregation and sedimentation of psnps lin et al 2021 the q e value of psnps adsorption on ms with nh 4 n as a cosolute increased with the increase in the nacl concentration fig 4b whereas the adsorption amount of nh 4 n did not exhibit any major difference fig 4c which can be attributed to the large amounts of psnps on the ms surface this promoting effect of nacl on the psnps adhesion is explained by the following points i in the initial state nh 4 n was first adsorbed on ms whereas a small amount of psnps was adsorbed on the ms with the increase in the nacl concentration the effective sites available for pollutant adsorption on the surface of ms decreased in the multi nh 4 n solution this corresponds to the trend of the q e value of psnps at higher nacl concentrations in other words at higher nacl concentrations more psnps bound nh 4 n were available for complexation interactions with ms through ion bridging ii the charge of the nh 4 n captured by psnps and ms were neutralised by the enhanced ionic strength causing a reduction in the electrostatic repulsion of these particles li et al 2021a zhang et al 2020 thus the nh 4 n coated psnps and ms have better complexation interactions in multi solute media with a monovalent electrolyte as a result of bridging adsorption and charge neutralisation schubert et al 2019 ho and leung 2021 3 3 2 effect of dom the d h value and cumulative mass of psnps adsorbed on ms in the presence of nh 4 n are illustrated in fig 4d f as a function of dom concentrations the d h values of psnps with different dom concentrations were lack of markedly difference fig 4d indicating that the aggregation state of psnps was hardly affected by the addition of dom and that its effect exceeds the cosolute effect of nh 4 n moreover the q e value of psnps adsorbed on ms in the presence of nh 4 n as a cosolute decreased with the increase in the dom concentration and the adsorbed amount of psnps decreased from 2 61 to 0 2 mg g fig 4e whereas there was no remarkable difference in the adsorption amount of nh 4 n fig 4f these results revealed that the addition of dom could significantly inhibit the attachment of psnps several previous studies have demonstrated that dom was readily adsorbed on mms or nanoparticles leading to neutralisation and even reversal of the surface charge of colloids aiken et al 2011 lee et al 2005 chen et al 2023 therefore the attachment of psnps on ms decreased because the complexation rate of dom was much higher than that of nh 4 n in multi solute systems moreover the aggregation of the nanoparticles in the suspensions treated with dom decreased thereby the deposition of nanoparticles in saturated porous media was inhibited singh et al 2019 wu et al 2019 particularly the zeta potential of ms decreased with dom addition fig s6 which was dramatically correlated with the reduction in psnps attachment this is ascribed to the enhanced electrostatic repulsion and steric effect between ms and psnps upon dom addition because dom was loaded on the surface of ms or psnps which yielded changed surface properties wu et al 2018 wang et al 2016 at high dom concentrations few nh 4 n coated psnps surfaces were useful for the subsequent complexation of ms via bridging effect which could be attributed to the charge neutralisation of the inversely charged dom and nh 4 n tan et al 2019 moreover the steric repulsion of dom to psnps was stronger than the nh 4 n bridging effect additionally the electric double layers of ms bound psnps and nh 4 n were compressed because of the increase in the concentration of dom causing a reduction in the surface electrostatic potential of these samples lee et al 2021 as proved by a reduction in the zeta potential fig s6 3 3 3 effect of ph the adsorbed amounts of psnps on ms in the presence of nh 4 n significantly decreased at high ph values which is reflected in the massive decrease in the ms adsorption capacity from 8 56 to 1 4 mg g with the increasing ph from 3 2 to 9 2 respectively fig 5 b however the d h values of psnps exhibited a downward trend with increasing ph values fig 5a which reflects a reduction in the agglomeration of psnps in alkaline environments due to the electronegativity of the psnps surfaces zhou et al 2020 moreover the q e values of nh 4 n exhibited no significant difference at different d h values fig 5c thus the solution ph plays a crucial role in the attachment of psnps the decrease in psnps adsorption on ms at high ph values can be ascribed to the reduction in the electrostatic attraction between ms and psnps with the increase in the solution ph and the psnps can be maintained in a stable state because of the increase in the hydroxide ions wang et al 2021b zhou et al 2022 therefore few nh 4 n bound psnps surfaces were available for the subsequent interactions with ms under neutral and alkaline conditions moreover direct interactions between ms and psnps possibly occurred under acidic conditions because of the electrostatic attraction between ms and psnps particles 3 3 4 effect of metal cations the aggregation and adsorption amount of psnps by ms were markedly affected by the addition of different types of metal cations to multi solute solutions fig 5d f indicate that both the d h and q e values of psnps varied significantly with different metal ions and the order of their effect on the adsorption of psnps on ms is as follows cu ii pb ii zn ii cd ii fig 5e moreover the d h change of psnps was consistent with the influence order of the metal ions on psnps adsorption capacity fig 5d cu ii exhibited a stronger affinity for psnps adsorption sites than pb ii zn ii and cd ii thus the q e values of nh 4 n decreased in the multi solute system with the four metal cations fig 5f this result can be mainly attributed to the stronger electrostatic interactions between psnps and the four metal ions which affords an increase the metallic electronegativity with the increase in the ionic radius the complexation effect of metal cations with psnps was stronger than that of nh 4 n huang et al 2020 wang et al 2017 moreover high q e values of psnps were observed with the addition of metal cations because of the increase in the available sites and the strong attraction forces between ms and psnps the aggregation behavior and colloidal stability of psnps were changed by the cosolute and cations which is reflected in the increase in the d h values these results can be attributed to the hydrolysis ability electronegativity and hydration radius of the metal ions ho and lenug 2021 lópez et al 2020 concisely the metal ions bind more easily to psnps which can be ascribed to the schulze hardy rule schulze 1882 hardy 1900 therefore the adsorbed amount of psnps on ms increased because the psnps clusters are easily adsorbed in the existence of multivalent metal ions 3 4 adsorption in complex aqueous matrices after clarifying the interaction mechanism between ms and psnps in the presence of nh 4 n the interactions among the four substances were examined in actual environmental samples i e tap water domestic sewage river water and lake water the adsorbed amounts of psnps on ms in the presence of nh 4 n in the different media were in the following order lake water domestic sewage river water tap water fig 6 a and b which can be attributed to the high ionic strength of lake water followed by domestic sewage river water and tap water table s1 although both domestic sewage and river water had high ph values the removal efficiency of nh 4 n in domestic sewage river water and lake water can reach over 90 fig 6b the psnps removal from tap water was poorer from than the other samples possibly because no interactions occurred between the anions no3 and po4 3 and ms these results indicated that different ions in the aqueous solution can considerably interfere with the adsorption of psnps on ms in the presence of nh 4 n li et al 2021 4 conclusions natural water environment is a complex system and often contain various pollutants this study investigated the complexation interactions among ms psnps and nh 4 n in a multi solute medium the results indicate that a significant amount of psnps can be adsorbed on the surface of ms with nh 4 n as a cosolute through complexation and ion bridging the adsorption amount of psnps on the ms surface depends on the valence state and electronegativity of the coexisting ions and the surface structure and functional groups of psnps moreover the ms psnps nh 4 n complex formation was facilitated in monovalent electrolyte solutions which was attributed to the charge neutralisation effect the actual environmental sample experiment revealed that the adsorption of psnps on ms is the highest in lake water systems these findings revealed the critical role of nh 4 n in the adsorption of psnps on ms and demonstrated the considerable impact of psnps adsorption on ms with or without nh 4 n on the fate and uptake of psnps the
