11600,in sub saharan africa water resources are scarce and subject to competing uses especially for agricultural production energy generation and ecosystem services these water intensive activities in the usangu plains and the ruaha national park in southern tanzania present a typical case for such water competition at the water energy food nexus to decipher the coupled human nature interactions in the great ruaha river basin and effectively communicate the results to non technical practitioners the water energy food nexus competition in the system is simulated using an advanced water system modeling approach and findings are visualized via interactive web based tools data driven document d3 that foster fuller understanding of the findings for both practitioners and stakeholders our results indicate that a combination of infrastructural and procedural measures each acceptable from a social and economic perspective and understanding that zero flows cannot be totally eliminated during dry years in the ruaha national park are likely to be the best way forward this study also reveals that the combination of improvements in irrigation efficiency cutbacks on proposed expansion of irrigated lands and a low head weir at the wetland outlet significantly reduces the number of zero flow days i e increasing ecosystem function resulting in positive effects on agricultural sector from limited if any reduction in rice crop yields these upstream measures are all relatively cost efficient and can combine to free up resources for other economic activity downstream i e more stable hydropower production keywords few nexus water competition coupled human nature system uncertainty 1 introduction water competition among different sectors in sub saharan africa is both common and inevitable since water is the key resource for food production power generation navigation and wildlife activities performed by a variety of stakeholders along the great ruaha river one major tributary of the rufiji river instigate such competition at the local water energy food wef nexus the ruaha national park rnp fig 1 the largest national park in tanzania is one of the key tourism spots in the country and the great ruaha river is the only water source for wildlife in the dry season usually between june and september the mtera and kidatu reservoir fig 1 downstream of the rnp which supply a majority of electricity for tanzania need stable streamflow to maintain their hydropower generation large scale rice irrigations located inside the usangu plain upstream of the rnp started in the early 1980s and require water for their crop production a clear water competition between irrigation upstream ecological purpose midstream and hydropower generation downstream make the water resources management difficult in that the major irrigation water use is located upstream of the hydropower facility a unique setting similar to the volta basin decreasing volumes of streamflow and a growing number of zero flow days inside the rnp during the dry season became observable two decades ago thus intensifying water competition and threatening biodiversity values and related tourism income in the rnp the government of tanzania and several international agencies like world bank international water management institute and african development bank conducted a number of studies to examine the hydro climatic condition for this region studies by smuwc 2001 lankford et al 2009 kangalawe et al 2011 and shu and villholth 2012 showed no significant long term trend in precipitation a slight downward trend in total streamflow and a relatively clear downward trend for the dry season streamflow from 1958 to 2004 especially at msembe ferry station fig 1 previous ecological studies emphasized the importance of the ihefu wetland fig 1 low flow condition in sections of the great ruaha river upstream of the ihefu wetland in the rnp is of particular interest for ecosystem preservation drying of the great ruaha river not only threatens wildlife but also promotes unusual migration of local wildlife towards the nearby farms mtahiko et al 2006 to maintain a healthy ecosystem for the entire usangu plains different environmental flow requirements were proposed mtahiko et al 2006 estimated the drinking water demand by large mammals in the national park as 17 09 million cubic meters mcm per year kihwele et al 2012 suggested that the reduced peak flow into the ihefu wetland could result in a growth of vegetated silted islands in the river channel and affect fish migration wwf 2010 estimated the long term average annual environmental flow requirement of 303 2mcm at msembe ferry several studies estimated the total irrigated land and water uses mostly for the rice irrigation in the usangu plains however their results vary considerably due to critical detailed data such as crop cycle in each plot are not available the first estimation of the total maximal irrigated area ranges are from 42 000 to 55 000ha and the annual gross irrigation requirement ranges from 557mcm to 815mcm according to smuwc 2001 some follow up studies applied the same range of crop area but estimated different irrigation requirements 576mcm per year kadigi et al 2013 810mcm per year mdemu et al 2004 350mcm per year mwakalila 2005 and 979mcm per year kadigi et al 2008 more recently critchley 2015 used the remote sensing data from the landsat tm spot high resolution satellite image to identify the irrigation area developed during the period 1985 2013 in the great ruaha river basin the upstream of the mtera reservoir based on the landsat tm spot for the year 2013 critchley 2015 identified an expansion of irrigation area to about 115 400ha some previous modeling studies that applied a modeling framework integrating hydrologic and human induced water cycles include the smuwc 2001 kashaigili et al 2006 2007 wwf 2010 wrem 2013 and mow 2015 suggestions from these studies are summarized improving local irrigation efficiency is still important irrigation infrastructures need to be carefully designed economic efficiency is necessary but insufficient to determine water allocation water use trade off between human livelihood and ecosystem preservation need to be carefully reviewed and water management plan should build on the traditional informal arrangements despite the invaluable insights on the fundamental understanding of the wef nexus in the great ruaha river some research gaps still exist specifically limitations found in the previous studies are 1 used a single model either process based hydrologic model or empirical based water balance model to quantify the water available in the entire system 2 diagnose their models with a single target only i e streamflow and 3 put little emphasis on using novel and more effective tools to communicate their results to non technical practitioners the objective of this paper is to address these gaps by developing a coupled modeling framework capable of explicitly quantifying natural and human components that affect the wef nexus in the great ruaha river system calibrating the model based on the pooled calibration with multiple targets of streamflow water depth and hydropower generation and providing an interactive web based visualization tool via a javascript library data driven documents designed to facilitate the communication with decision makers about our findings our modeling effort seeks to augment our understanding of the wef nexus in the great ruaha river basin which will help us effectively assess the possible mitigation measures policy to improve flows in the rnp 2 methodology 2 1 modeling approach for water system analysis to model the wef nexus of the great ruaha river basin a coupled modeling framework has been developed to explicitly quantify natural and human components in the system the modeling approach divides the great ruaha river system into different sub systems fig 2 and uses a suite of modeling tools consisting of a process based hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning hbv hydrologic model bergström 1995 and a mass balance based water system model to simulate hydrological processes and human activities for each sub system a similar approach has been used in south asia south east asia and the us george et al 2011a george et al 2011b yang et al 2016a yang et al 2016b zhao et al 2016 the key aspects of our modeling approach are summarized as follows hydrologic regimes in the south and south east mountains are described with the hbv model the hbv model is calibrated using the genetic algorithm wang 1991 to match historical streamflow at gauges on ndembera river mbarali river and chimala river blue arrows in fig 2 the western and north western catchments are described with the same hbv model but differently set up to simulate the characteristics of ephemeral sand rivers model calibration is conducted based on one station located in the north west of kizigo river the irrigation areas orange rectangles in fig 2 and the seasonally inundated usangu plains green trapezoid in fig 2 are described via the irrigation and floodplain modules in the water system model based on empirical equations the majority of irrigated land and water are used for rice there are some irrigated vegetables but mostly for domestic purpose other crops like maize and beans also exist but these crops are primary rainfed and therefore not included in our model the irrigation water demand is calculated based on a crop water requirement model cropwat fao 1993 and non beneficial net evaporation losses in the floodplain are calibrated against observed flows at nyaluhanga for the period of 2001 2011 the ihefu permanently inundated wetland light blue ellipsoid in fig 2 is modeled as a natural reservoir in the swamp module of the water system model in which inflow outflow net evaporation losses and storage are estimated from rainfall and potential evaporation the ihefu reservoir model is calibrated against the observed water levels from 1992 to 2013 and the streamflow record at msembe ferry from 1963 to 2013 the combined system is validated by the observed flows at msembe ferry in the ruaha national park the hydropower plants at mtera and kidatu are included to simulate power production with assumed standard operation rules hydropower module in the water system model purple triangles in fig 2 the coupled modeling framework facilitates the implementation of pooled calibration wi et al 2015 in that state variables pertaining to both modeling components for hydrology and water management can be used as calibration targets in the calibration procedure we improve the models to better fit the observed wetland water depth and reservoir hydropower generation in addition to observed streamflow details of the modeling structure equations and calibration results measured with nash sutcliff efficiency nash and sutcliff 1970 are given in the supplemental materials 2 2 data collection and the field trip for the modeling purpose several different types of data were collected the historical daily streamflow data were provided by the rufiji basin water office in several different locations for the upper part of the rufiji river satellite image based crop area time series are provided by the european space agency critchley 2015 satellite image based water level data in ihefu from 1992 to 2013 calibrated and validated with water depth loggers after 2008 are provided by dr wolanski in the james cook university to build the hydrologic model for the system the monthly global precipitation climatology centre schneider et al 2014 data are temporally downscaled using the princeton global meteorological forcing dataset for land surface modeling to set up daily precipitation input for the period 1961 2008 daily temperature data are directly obtained from the princeton climate data for the purpose of validating the hydrologic model for the recent period 1999 2013 daily precipitation data from the tropical rainfall measuring mission and daily temperature data from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer are used a field trip to the study site was undertaken in mid march 2015 the purpose of this trip was to 1 gather ground truth findings by the european space agency on irrigated areas in the usangu plains 2 assess possible structural options to mitigate the impacts from zero flows in the great ruaha river upstream of msembe ferry and 3 collect streamflow and detailed irrigation related data schedule capacity yield etc for systems modeling purpose we visited six major irrigation sites madibira manienga mbarali mapogolo kapunga and kibaoni and interviewed with local farmers in each site we also visited the head offices of commercial irrigation companies in madibira and kapunga to get more details of their water distribution scheme the site visit confirmed the landsat interpretation indicating rice cultivation in various stages that the number of total hectares under irrigation upstream of the ihefu wetland is over 100 000ha other than the previous estimated as 40 50 000ha the interview with local farmers and irrigation company managers also confirmed that different crop schedules exist in each irrigation site the areas for rice irrigation are not always planted and cultivated at the same time there is a phasing of the 3 5 months crop season over a total period of 9 10 months oct july as lankford et al 2009 mentioned that modernized intakes appeared to increase the total length of the season of abstraction our site visit confirms this statement considering the expansion of irrigated area and crop season it is necessary to secure more water therefore the local farmers take turns in their planting time and the harvest for the latest planting are around jan feb and jun july respectively in our model we set up the crop season from oct to july to reflect this reality more detailed model settings about longer crop season and different irrigation requirements are given in the supplemental materials 2 3 interactive web based visualization communicating environmental research to non technical practitioners is challenging due to their differing interests and concerns it is further complicated by the growing number of relevant factors that need to be considered such as climate change and infrastructure development in this paper we introduce an intuitive way to communicate water system analysis results to practitioners using interactive web based visualization tools developed by the javascript data driven documents d3 d3 is a javascript library for manipulating documents based on data bostock et al 2011 d3 allows web designers to selectively bind input data to arbitrary document elements within the document object model and apply dynamic transformations to generate and modify content to be visualized using scalable vector graphics for demonstration purpose we introduce two commonly used types of d3 applications dynamic scatter plot matrices and dynamic parallel coordinates plots with brushing function that can filter out unwanted scenarios and be used for decision support brushing is a commonly used mechanism in visualization tools to help people explore the relationship between data and results in a different but related view li and north 2003 and it is also an effective strategy for exploring the relationship between data subsets and dimensions hajizadeh et al 2013 this intuitive human computer interaction point and click or drag and drop is a critical factor for an efficient decision making process o brien et al 2008 and antle et al 2009 in the real world water management objectives sometimes conflict with each other a scatter plot is a good way to visualize if the trade off exists between two objectives if more than two objectives need to be considered a scatter plot matrix can be used to demonstrate the one on one relationship this scatters plot matrix can visualize multiple management concerns simultaneously to help decision makers understand interactions among them kasprzyk et al 2009 however a static scatters plot matrix can be overwhelming for non technical practitioners and they might only focus on the two objectives that are most interesting to them the dynamic scatters plot matrix constructed by d3 can not only show the relationship between different management concerns but also allow users to use the brushing function to highlight decision thresholds and see the effect of their decisions on other neglected concerns the parallel coordinates plot is often used to represent the interconnection between multiple management objectives inselberg 1985 each line in this plot represents one modeling result under a specific set of conditions or scenario it is widely used in the water resources system analysis to demonstrate trade offs between multiple objectives kasprzyk et al 2009 herman et al 2014 rosenberg 2015 and hadka et al 2015 previous studies have used static parallel coordinates plots which often limited their axes to the modeling results management concerns only this is mainly due to the complexity of this figure too many axes will significantly reduce its readability the dynamic parallel coordinates plot from d3 can overcome this limitation by showing all key drivers and management concerns in one plot while using the brushing function to enhance readability through the brushing interaction users can select a range of drivers and highlight their effect on all concerns this plot can also be used backward following the concept of robust decision making lempert and collins 2007 and decision scaling brown 2010 to allow users to select a range of concerns and back trace a scenario that causes a problematic situation 3 scenario setup 3 1 management concerns there are a variety of management concerns involved due to conflicting interests within great ruaha river basin a system analysis approach is applied to simulate the various management concerns as a multi objective water allocation problem the three representative management concerns simulated in this study are 1 upstream water deficit for rice irrigation food 2 middle stream number of zero flow days at the ihefu outlet water and 3 downstream annual hydropower production at mtera and kidatu energy the irrigation water deficit was defined as the difference between the actual water applied to rice affected by water withdrawal and irrigation efficiency and potential crop water requirement this is a major concern for farmers as most of the rice production requires irrigation throughout the growing season october to july the number of zero flow days at the ihefu wetland s outlet i e ngiriama is a key ecological concern for the rnp the number of zero flow days is used as an indicator for the health of the great ruaha river a recent study done by sweco 2015 concluded that the reduced inflow to the mtera reservoir likely due to the upstream water withdrawal for irrigation is the primary reason for the low hydropower generation from mtera and kidatu reservoir for the past decade hydropower generation from mtera and kidatu is a major concern of the country s energy security 3 2 drivers and measures two drivers that affect the three management concerns described in the previous section are presented here 1 crop area changes and 2 streamflow change we also introduce two major measures that can be considered to mitigate negative impacts of the drivers 1 irrigation efficiency improvement and 2 water infrastructure development according to the satellite image based crop area data our analysis used three historical crop area expansion rates i e for the 1998 2013 trend the 2004 2013 trend and the 2008 2013 trend to project a future crop area expansion increasing crop area will add additional stresses to this water limited system detailed calculation of crop area increases is given in the supplement materials the model also tests a scenario if the crop area inside the rnp were removed this can be considered as a measure rather than a driver the upstream flow from the southern kipengere mountain area to the system is another driver that affect all management concerns changing streamflow can be seen as a proxy for different scenarios such as climate change which can result in either increase or decrease of streamflow and upstream domestic water use increases the model systematically changes the inflow from 20 to 20 compared to the baseline which explained later in the text with 10 interval and checks its impact on all management concerns we use a simple delta change method to increase or decrease the 10 day streamflow from the hbv model for the entire modeling period this is because we only focus on the total volume change impact on the downstream water uses rather than the impact of streamflow timing change future studies can further explore the impact of streamflow timing change on all management concerns through verbal communication with farmers and our own visual inspection of the channel condition during the field trip we confirmed that the current irrigation system is water constrained and the average irrigation efficiency is about 25 which is in line with the range of 20 30 from previous studies e g smuwc 2001 due to insufficient design or poor maintenance therefore we use the water system model to evaluate the impact of system wide irrigation efficiency levels i e efficiency improvements by 40 60 and 80 are considered to mitigate management concerns in this study we defined irrigation efficiency as the ratio between actual water used to satisfy crop water requirement and total water withdrawals this sensitive analysis is useful to inform decision makers about a certain level of irrigation efficiency that investment plans should try to reach during the field visit water infrastructure dams and weirs development proposals were also suggested by several stakeholders thus we made water infrastructure development as another measure proposed projects included a v notch weir or a gated weir at the outlet of ihefu wetland the v notch weir is not a control weir but minimal release can be setup for the gated weir releases of one and two cubic meters per second cms for the gated weir were tested in the model a summary of these drivers measures is given in table 1 models are run for all combinations of these drivers measures and these combinations are defined as scenarios for example the baseline scenario is current crop land current efficiency no water infrastructure current streamflow in total 400 scenarios were run 4 result 4 1 impacts of individual driver and measure the box whisker charts are used to demonstrate the effect of single driver and measure on three major management concerns with the range of uncertainty caused by others the baseline scenario all drivers and measures are current as described in section 3 2 is used as a basis and the percentage change of management concerns are shown as the length of the box fig 3 shows crop area expansion clearly has a stronger negative effect on irrigation deficits since more crop area will require more water to irrigate when inflow water supply is the same more demand irrigation will result in more deficits under the current crop area baseline the irrigation deficits have a general decreasing pattern due to the effect of measures however under the 98 13 trend for example all positive effect of these measures will be offset by crop area expansion fig 3a this means if the crop area expansion follows the most extreme pattern no measure can reduce the current irrigation deficits a similar pattern was found for the zero flow days but the negative effect of crop area expansion is relatively smaller compared to irrigation deficits this is because ihefu wetland still serves as a buffer for zero flow days hydropower will not be significantly affected when crop area is expanded the range of all boxes are between 18 and 19 this is because we can only correctly model hydropower generation at annual scale and both ihefu wetland and mtera reservoir have water storage to buffer the impact at annual scale fig 3b shows the effect of inflow change indicating fairly linear trends for all three management concerns when inflows to the system change from 20 to 20 irrigation deficits and zero flow days will systematically decrease while hydropower generation will systematically increase fig 4 shows the effect of two measures irrigation efficiency improvement and water infrastructure development increasing the irrigation efficiency systematically reduces the irrigation deficit and the number of zero flow days fig 4a this measure also reduces the uncertainty range of these boxes because irrigated demands can be satisfied with less inflow under higher efficiency for example the irrigation deficit ranges from 67 to 63 under 60 efficiency compared to the baseline efficiency which causes the irrigation deficiency to range from 44 to 146 this measure can also significantly reduce the number of zero flow days however some outliers still remain indicating that improving irrigation efficiency alone cannot guarantee the complete elimination of the zero flow days in the ihefu wetland fig 4b shows the effect of water infrastructure no effect has been found for the irrigation deficits because these proposed infrastructures are located downstream of the major crop areas also no effect has been reported on the annual hydropower generation due to the fact that these infrastructures were designed to change the timing of the flow within a year however significant effects on the number of zero flow days are observed unlike the previous measure even outliers on the box chart are located below the 0 line meaning that these infrastructures can almost guarantee the improvement of zero flow day conditions in the ihefu wetland under all other uncertainties 4 2 evaluating combination effects for policy informing we developed dynamic parallel coordinates plots using the d3 which consists of a series of parallel axes representing the different drivers and their combination effects on management concerns in the parallel coordinates plots each of the 400 scenarios is represented by a line that intersects with the driver axes a table accompanied by the plot presents values of drivers measures and the three management concerns corresponding to the individual scenario the d3 based parallel coordinates plots enable users to interact with it directly when users click on the title of one axis the individual line adopts a different color varying through blue purple and red in fig 5 a the irrigation deficits axis is selected red lines represent higher irrigation deficits and blue lines represent lower irrigation deficits once the user has selected one axis the user can see how closely another axis correlates to the selected axis by seeing if the lines have arranged themselves in a similar color pattern when they cross the second axis for example in fig 5a crop area expansion and high irrigation efficiency appear to be the most sensitive driver and measure of irrigation deficit most lines connected with crop area expansion are red and most lines connected with the efficiency levels of 60 and 80 are blue this result provides an intuitive confirmation for agricultural water management when the user clicks on the hydropower axis the pattern of red and blue lines changed fig 5b this result shows that if we focus on hydropower inflow appears to be the most sensitive driver since most red lines higher hydropower generation are associated with inflow increase double clicking on an axis changes the sorting method from ascending to descending or vice versa for example when users double click on the axes for irrigation deficits and zero flow days all three management concern axes will have their preferred management target on top fig 5c this setting becomes similar to the demonstration in kasprzyk et al 2009 and herman et al 2014 whenever lines across two management concerns have a trade off in our example we have found some lines across each other but due to the large number of scenarios it might not be convenient to capture the potential trade off therefore we rely on the brushing function of the d3 which can filter out irrelevant scenarios to further inform policy makers users can select an acceptable range i e decision or policy threshold for each management concern axis fig 6 a then the plot will only show the scenarios that fit within the indicated thresholds the corresponding table will simultaneously update with a list of the highlighted scenarios following the concept of the robust decision making or decision scaling these highlighted scenarios set up boundaries on drivers and measures to assist in negotiation between decision makers assuming the minister of agriculture states that 150 million cubic meters of water per year is acceptable irrigation deficits the minister of energy feels that an annual hydropower production of 1 3 twh per year is acceptable the director of the rnp feels that in order to reach the park s ecological goals s he will not be satisfied with more than 5 zero flow days each year fig 6a provides a clear message to all decision makers that these thresholds cannot all be met if the crop area follows the 1998 2013 or 2004 2013 increasing trend if the irrigation efficiency is not improved if no water infrastructure is built or if the inflow is at the historical level or less if all three decision makers insist their decision thresholds following the example of fig 6a funding will be needed to improve irrigation efficiency to at least 40 water infrastructure is needed at ihefu wetland and crop area expansion needs to be regulated furthermore inflow needs to increase at least 10 which is out of human control without transboundary water diversion the brushing function then provides an easy way for users to change their highlighted range as part of a negotiation or compromise for example if the director of the rnp can accept 20 zero flow days per year fig 6b s he just needs to extend the selected range and more scenarios will show up in the plot with the corresponding table under this new decision threshold the largest difference is that water infrastructures become an optional choice to satisfy all three concerns although irrigation improvement crop area expansion regulation and more inflow are still needed this example demonstrates the capability of the dynamic parallel coordinates plot and its corresponding table a live link of this plot is given at http www lehigh edu yey217 tanparallel html this plot is modified from kai chang s example https syntagmatic github io parallel coordinates examples table html 4 3 economic aspect of the wef nexus kadigi et al 2008 and mccartney et al 2007 provided useful estimations for economic analysis of water energy and ecosystem resources in the great ruaha river basin in this section we use their economic estimations to evaluate the simplified economic aspect of the wef nexus note that we do not incorporate a complex hydro economic model such as those in george et al 2011a and yang et al 2016a but assume fixed social economic values for agricultural energy and ecosystem water uses according to kadigi et al 2008 the average gross value of the crop land is 64 9 usd per ha we use this number to estimate the cost needed to remove the crop area inside the rnp the average value of consumed water was estimated as 0 04 usd per m3 in kadigi et al 2008 and we adopt this value to calculate the change of agricultural profit due to the irrigation deficits change the value of water needed for rnp and the ihefu wetland including water for fisheries beekeeping and riverine ecosystem etc is 9 7 million usd per year mccartney et al 2007 while the daily cost of 26 600 usd is used to estimate the losses resulting from zero flow days note that we do not include the economic value of livestock grazing in the ihefu wetland in our analysis since we want to emphasize the ecological aspect of rnp the electricity value of 0 0656 usd per kwh kadigi et al 2008 mccartney et al 2007 is used to calculate the profit for hydropower generation we apply these values to the modeling results and calculate the overall economic value changes relative to the baseline scenario table 2 shows the effects of the drivers and measures with minimal average and maximal values the crop area change inflow change and irrigation efficiency improvement have significant economic effect in the system except for water infrastructures this is because water infrastructures have no effect on irrigation deficits and hydropower generation which are two major sources of economic values table 2 also provides the information of necessary conditions in order to gain a system wide economic profit if we treat the average values as expected economic gains the middle one in table 2 the crop area expansion should not be larger than the trend of 2008 2013 the inflow cannot be lower than the current condition and the irrigation efficiency should be improved at least by 40 either one of these can result in positive expected economic gains finally the minimal values under all conditions are negative meaning that no single driver or measure can guarantee positive economic gains under the uncertainties table 2 can be broken down into social economic value changes resulting from agriculture hydropower and rnp we use a d3 dynamic scatter plot matrix to show these result fig 7 a shows economic value changes of these aspects in three of the nine plots those on the diagonal the x axis is the same as the y axis resulting in all 400 data points falling on a 45 line note that upper three plots and lower three plots are the same except switching between x axis and y axis in these plots users can see a positive relationship between all three value changes agriculture and hydropower have the strongest relationship agriculture vs rnp and hydropower vs rnp also have positive relationships although not as strong as agriculture vs hydropower these results mean that in this particular case the economic value of agriculture hydropower and rnp will be affected in the same way when we consider impacts of drivers or how measures can mitigate impacts of drivers in other words if economic value is used as the objective for the project no tradeoff relationship exist in this study area even with no trade off relationship shown in the figure users can still brush the plots to explore the effect of decision thresholds on each of these economic value changes as an example let s say that the minister of agriculture and the minister of energy both want at least positive economic changes in their own sectors using the brushing function the two ministers can select a rectangle on the agriculture vs hydropower plot upper center that satisfies both of their requirements fig 7b brushing this area highlights the dots representing the scenarios that meet both of their requirements the scenarios that do not meet their requirements turn gray in all nine scatter plots in this example none of the selected dots is orange this indicates that it would be difficult to achieve positive economic value in both agriculture and hydropower if the crop area expansion follows the 1998 2013 trend under the assumption that the director of the rnp also wish to maintain at least positive economic value changes the dashed line in the third row of the matrix in fig 7b the decisions made by the minister of agriculture and energy satisfy this requirement since all colored dots are located above the dashed line this tool can help facilitate negotiation and compromise among decision makers this example demonstrates the capability of dynamic scatters plot matrix a live link of this plot is given at http www lehigh edu yey217 tanscatter html this plot is modified mike bostock s example http bl ocks org mbostock 4063663 5 discussion there are several uncertainties regarding the current coupled modeling framework and results in this paper we discuss some major uncertain sources in this section to highlight the limitation of our approach and provide suggestions for future follow up studies first data uncertainty stems from four different sources precipitation and temperature data for the hbv hydrologic model input observed streamflow and water level data for the hbv and water system model calibration water sources data for each irrigation scheme and economic value for water uses in different sectors precipitation and temperature data from reanalysis outputs dceepu 2006 might not be suitable for the 10 day time step since the data were bias corrected at the monthly level the streamflow observation is questionable because the rating curve at each gauge station varies through time satellite image based water level data were only validated with water logger after 2008 actual water sources for irrigation scheme cannot be lumped at subbasin scale in reality therefore further division of irrigation scheme is necessary to better capture the actual irrigation pattern value for economic estimation per volumetric water use will affect results of economic analysis and the follow up decision making e g fig 7 this complies with the remark from mccartney et al 2007 that research intent to inform policy should not just consider monetary values second model structure uncertainty contains three different aspects the empirical equation for the floodplain module equations to describe the hydrologic processes in the ihefu wetland and the operational rules for mtera and kidatu due to the very limited data for the usangu plains the inflow outflow relationship currently used is empirical while the water balance is maintained but the storage changes inside the flood plain are ignored in the model the ihefu wetland s storage surface area water level relationship is also highly uncertain previous modeling studies have different equations kashaigili et al 2006 mow 2015 smuwc 2001 wrem 2013 wwf 2010 furthermore no standard mtera and kidatu operational rule can be followed in reality therefore the model uses empirical equations to capture the water level fluctuation and annual hydropower generation for these two reservoirs third parameter uncertainty contains two different aspects the trend of water use efficiency and parameter equifinality beven 2005 that means in open systems a given end state can be reached by many potential means the trend of water use efficiency is not currently captured in the model since only one parameter is used for the entire simulation period equifinality issue in our case means that different sets of the parameter can result in similar model performances since the system is highly non linear because of the uncertainties the results of this study are only indicative however the model performance and results concur generally with ground information and with visual inspection of the situation in the usangu plains during the field trip there may be errors in individual numerical sub results as equifinality can have caused compensatory errors but it is likely that the overall description of the system and the indicated impacts of different measures are generally correct further ground surveys are needed to improve and update the system analysis model a more detailed survey and description on the irrigation areas the exact position of intakes main canals and drainage are top priorities also a more detailed topographical survey of the ihefu wetland is necessary to understand the water storage area relation and the discharge capacity at the ngiriama weir 6 conclusion the decreasing trend of streamflows during the last decades in the great ruaha river flowing through the usangu plains and the ruaha national park rnp in southern tanzania is a typical case for water energy food nexus competition in the sub saharan africa region utilizing the recently available remote sensing data for the crop area expansion and the water level in the ihefu wetland in rnp this study develops a coupled modeling framework that explicitly quantifies natural and human components in the great ruaha river system we calibrated the coupled model based on the pooled calibration with multiple targets streamflow water depth and hydropower generation and used an interactive web based visualization tool to communicate our scientific findings with non technical practitioners the results of the system modeling show that there is no simple solution to mitigate the ephemeral character of the great ruaha river in the national park no single measure such as improved water efficiency a reasonable reduction in irrigation area or even a low head weir at wetland outlet can completely remove zero flows in the rnp building a higher weir at ngiriama will likely solve the problem but will be costly and may have significant ecological impacts since such infrastructure will yield no increased hydropower production the high costs are difficult to be justified from an economic point of view similarly a massive reduction of rice irrigation areas in the usangu plains would likely minimize the period of zero flows in the park but would not be socio economically acceptable a combination of measures each acceptable from a social and economic perspective and accepting that zero flows cannot be totally eliminated during dry years are likely to be the best way forward the combination of irrigation efficiency improvements a modest reduction of irrigation areas improved productivity through agriculture management and a low head weir at ngiriama could significantly reduce the number of days of zero flows and will result in limited if any reduction in rice crop yields these measures are all relatively cost efficient and can possibly be economically motivated by an increased hydropower production at the mtera and kidatu plants further studies are required to improve the prediction of impacts of different mitigation measures ground surveys on the irrigation areas intakes main canals and drainages points as well as topographical surveys of the ihefu wetland and the ngiriama weir would improve the reliability of the simulated effects on downstream flows the possible design of a low weir at ngiriama needs to be studied from an engineering point of view to include viable technical options in the model acknowledgements the

11600,in sub saharan africa water resources are scarce and subject to competing uses especially for agricultural production energy generation and ecosystem services these water intensive activities in the usangu plains and the ruaha national park in southern tanzania present a typical case for such water competition at the water energy food nexus to decipher the coupled human nature interactions in the great ruaha river basin and effectively communicate the results to non technical practitioners the water energy food nexus competition in the system is simulated using an advanced water system modeling approach and findings are visualized via interactive web based tools data driven document d3 that foster fuller understanding of the findings for both practitioners and stakeholders our results indicate that a combination of infrastructural and procedural measures each acceptable from a social and economic perspective and understanding that zero flows cannot be totally eliminated during dry years in the ruaha national park are likely to be the best way forward this study also reveals that the combination of improvements in irrigation efficiency cutbacks on proposed expansion of irrigated lands and a low head weir at the wetland outlet significantly reduces the number of zero flow days i e increasing ecosystem function resulting in positive effects on agricultural sector from limited if any reduction in rice crop yields these upstream measures are all relatively cost efficient and can combine to free up resources for other economic activity downstream i e more stable hydropower production keywords few nexus water competition coupled human nature system uncertainty 1 introduction water competition among different sectors in sub saharan africa is both common and inevitable since water is the key resource for food production power generation navigation and wildlife activities performed by a variety of stakeholders along the great ruaha river one major tributary of the rufiji river instigate such competition at the local water energy food wef nexus the ruaha national park rnp fig 1 the largest national park in tanzania is one of the key tourism spots in the country and the great ruaha river is the only water source for wildlife in the dry season usually between june and september the mtera and kidatu reservoir fig 1 downstream of the rnp which supply a majority of electricity for tanzania need stable streamflow to maintain their hydropower generation large scale rice irrigations located inside the usangu plain upstream of the rnp started in the early 1980s and require water for their crop production a clear water competition between irrigation upstream ecological purpose midstream and hydropower generation downstream make the water resources management difficult in that the major irrigation water use is located upstream of the hydropower facility a unique setting similar to the volta basin decreasing volumes of streamflow and a growing number of zero flow days inside the rnp during the dry season became observable two decades ago thus intensifying water competition and threatening biodiversity values and related tourism income in the rnp the government of tanzania and several international agencies like world bank international water management institute and african development bank conducted a number of studies to examine the hydro climatic condition for this region studies by smuwc 2001 lankford et al 2009 kangalawe et al 2011 and shu and villholth 2012 showed no significant long term trend in precipitation a slight downward trend in total streamflow and a relatively clear downward trend for the dry season streamflow from 1958 to 2004 especially at msembe ferry station fig 1 previous ecological studies emphasized the importance of the ihefu wetland fig 1 low flow condition in sections of the great ruaha river upstream of the ihefu wetland in the rnp is of particular interest for ecosystem preservation drying of the great ruaha river not only threatens wildlife but also promotes unusual migration of local wildlife towards the nearby farms mtahiko et al 2006 to maintain a healthy ecosystem for the entire usangu plains different environmental flow requirements were proposed mtahiko et al 2006 estimated the drinking water demand by large mammals in the national park as 17 09 million cubic meters mcm per year kihwele et al 2012 suggested that the reduced peak flow into the ihefu wetland could result in a growth of vegetated silted islands in the river channel and affect fish migration wwf 2010 estimated the long term average annual environmental flow requirement of 303 2mcm at msembe ferry several studies estimated the total irrigated land and water uses mostly for the rice irrigation in the usangu plains however their results vary considerably due to critical detailed data such as crop cycle in each plot are not available the first estimation of the total maximal irrigated area ranges are from 42 000 to 55 000ha and the annual gross irrigation requirement ranges from 557mcm to 815mcm according to smuwc 2001 some follow up studies applied the same range of crop area but estimated different irrigation requirements 576mcm per year kadigi et al 2013 810mcm per year mdemu et al 2004 350mcm per year mwakalila 2005 and 979mcm per year kadigi et al 2008 more recently critchley 2015 used the remote sensing data from the landsat tm spot high resolution satellite image to identify the irrigation area developed during the period 1985 2013 in the great ruaha river basin the upstream of the mtera reservoir based on the landsat tm spot for the year 2013 critchley 2015 identified an expansion of irrigation area to about 115 400ha some previous modeling studies that applied a modeling framework integrating hydrologic and human induced water cycles include the smuwc 2001 kashaigili et al 2006 2007 wwf 2010 wrem 2013 and mow 2015 suggestions from these studies are summarized improving local irrigation efficiency is still important irrigation infrastructures need to be carefully designed economic efficiency is necessary but insufficient to determine water allocation water use trade off between human livelihood and ecosystem preservation need to be carefully reviewed and water management plan should build on the traditional informal arrangements despite the invaluable insights on the fundamental understanding of the wef nexus in the great ruaha river some research gaps still exist specifically limitations found in the previous studies are 1 used a single model either process based hydrologic model or empirical based water balance model to quantify the water available in the entire system 2 diagnose their models with a single target only i e streamflow and 3 put little emphasis on using novel and more effective tools to communicate their results to non technical practitioners the objective of this paper is to address these gaps by developing a coupled modeling framework capable of explicitly quantifying natural and human components that affect the wef nexus in the great ruaha river system calibrating the model based on the pooled calibration with multiple targets of streamflow water depth and hydropower generation and providing an interactive web based visualization tool via a javascript library data driven documents designed to facilitate the communication with decision makers about our findings our modeling effort seeks to augment our understanding of the wef nexus in the great ruaha river basin which will help us effectively assess the possible mitigation measures policy to improve flows in the rnp 2 methodology 2 1 modeling approach for water system analysis to model the wef nexus of the great ruaha river basin a coupled modeling framework has been developed to explicitly quantify natural and human components in the system the modeling approach divides the great ruaha river system into different sub systems fig 2 and uses a suite of modeling tools consisting of a process based hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning hbv hydrologic model bergström 1995 and a mass balance based water system model to simulate hydrological processes and human activities for each sub system a similar approach has been used in south asia south east asia and the us george et al 2011a george et al 2011b yang et al 2016a yang et al 2016b zhao et al 2016 the key aspects of our modeling approach are summarized as follows hydrologic regimes in the south and south east mountains are described with the hbv model the hbv model is calibrated using the genetic algorithm wang 1991 to match historical streamflow at gauges on ndembera river mbarali river and chimala river blue arrows in fig 2 the western and north western catchments are described with the same hbv model but differently set up to simulate the characteristics of ephemeral sand rivers model calibration is conducted based on one station located in the north west of kizigo river the irrigation areas orange rectangles in fig 2 and the seasonally inundated usangu plains green trapezoid in fig 2 are described via the irrigation and floodplain modules in the water system model based on empirical equations the majority of irrigated land and water are used for rice there are some irrigated vegetables but mostly for domestic purpose other crops like maize and beans also exist but these crops are primary rainfed and therefore not included in our model the irrigation water demand is calculated based on a crop water requirement model cropwat fao 1993 and non beneficial net evaporation losses in the floodplain are calibrated against observed flows at nyaluhanga for the period of 2001 2011 the ihefu permanently inundated wetland light blue ellipsoid in fig 2 is modeled as a natural reservoir in the swamp module of the water system model in which inflow outflow net evaporation losses and storage are estimated from rainfall and potential evaporation the ihefu reservoir model is calibrated against the observed water levels from 1992 to 2013 and the streamflow record at msembe ferry from 1963 to 2013 the combined system is validated by the observed flows at msembe ferry in the ruaha national park the hydropower plants at mtera and kidatu are included to simulate power production with assumed standard operation rules hydropower module in the water system model purple triangles in fig 2 the coupled modeling framework facilitates the implementation of pooled calibration wi et al 2015 in that state variables pertaining to both modeling components for hydrology and water management can be used as calibration targets in the calibration procedure we improve the models to better fit the observed wetland water depth and reservoir hydropower generation in addition to observed streamflow details of the modeling structure equations and calibration results measured with nash sutcliff efficiency nash and sutcliff 1970 are given in the supplemental materials 2 2 data collection and the field trip for the modeling purpose several different types of data were collected the historical daily streamflow data were provided by the rufiji basin water office in several different locations for the upper part of the rufiji river satellite image based crop area time series are provided by the european space agency critchley 2015 satellite image based water level data in ihefu from 1992 to 2013 calibrated and validated with water depth loggers after 2008 are provided by dr wolanski in the james cook university to build the hydrologic model for the system the monthly global precipitation climatology centre schneider et al 2014 data are temporally downscaled using the princeton global meteorological forcing dataset for land surface modeling to set up daily precipitation input for the period 1961 2008 daily temperature data are directly obtained from the princeton climate data for the purpose of validating the hydrologic model for the recent period 1999 2013 daily precipitation data from the tropical rainfall measuring mission and daily temperature data from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer are used a field trip to the study site was undertaken in mid march 2015 the purpose of this trip was to 1 gather ground truth findings by the european space agency on irrigated areas in the usangu plains 2 assess possible structural options to mitigate the impacts from zero flows in the great ruaha river upstream of msembe ferry and 3 collect streamflow and detailed irrigation related data schedule capacity yield etc for systems modeling purpose we visited six major irrigation sites madibira manienga mbarali mapogolo kapunga and kibaoni and interviewed with local farmers in each site we also visited the head offices of commercial irrigation companies in madibira and kapunga to get more details of their water distribution scheme the site visit confirmed the landsat interpretation indicating rice cultivation in various stages that the number of total hectares under irrigation upstream of the ihefu wetland is over 100 000ha other than the previous estimated as 40 50 000ha the interview with local farmers and irrigation company managers also confirmed that different crop schedules exist in each irrigation site the areas for rice irrigation are not always planted and cultivated at the same time there is a phasing of the 3 5 months crop season over a total period of 9 10 months oct july as lankford et al 2009 mentioned that modernized intakes appeared to increase the total length of the season of abstraction our site visit confirms this statement considering the expansion of irrigated area and crop season it is necessary to secure more water therefore the local farmers take turns in their planting time and the harvest for the latest planting are around jan feb and jun july respectively in our model we set up the crop season from oct to july to reflect this reality more detailed model settings about longer crop season and different irrigation requirements are given in the supplemental materials 2 3 interactive web based visualization communicating environmental research to non technical practitioners is challenging due to their differing interests and concerns it is further complicated by the growing number of relevant factors that need to be considered such as climate change and infrastructure development in this paper we introduce an intuitive way to communicate water system analysis results to practitioners using interactive web based visualization tools developed by the javascript data driven documents d3 d3 is a javascript library for manipulating documents based on data bostock et al 2011 d3 allows web designers to selectively bind input data to arbitrary document elements within the document object model and apply dynamic transformations to generate and modify content to be visualized using scalable vector graphics for demonstration purpose we introduce two commonly used types of d3 applications dynamic scatter plot matrices and dynamic parallel coordinates plots with brushing function that can filter out unwanted scenarios and be used for decision support brushing is a commonly used mechanism in visualization tools to help people explore the relationship between data and results in a different but related view li and north 2003 and it is also an effective strategy for exploring the relationship between data subsets and dimensions hajizadeh et al 2013 this intuitive human computer interaction point and click or drag and drop is a critical factor for an efficient decision making process o brien et al 2008 and antle et al 2009 in the real world water management objectives sometimes conflict with each other a scatter plot is a good way to visualize if the trade off exists between two objectives if more than two objectives need to be considered a scatter plot matrix can be used to demonstrate the one on one relationship this scatters plot matrix can visualize multiple management concerns simultaneously to help decision makers understand interactions among them kasprzyk et al 2009 however a static scatters plot matrix can be overwhelming for non technical practitioners and they might only focus on the two objectives that are most interesting to them the dynamic scatters plot matrix constructed by d3 can not only show the relationship between different management concerns but also allow users to use the brushing function to highlight decision thresholds and see the effect of their decisions on other neglected concerns the parallel coordinates plot is often used to represent the interconnection between multiple management objectives inselberg 1985 each line in this plot represents one modeling result under a specific set of conditions or scenario it is widely used in the water resources system analysis to demonstrate trade offs between multiple objectives kasprzyk et al 2009 herman et al 2014 rosenberg 2015 and hadka et al 2015 previous studies have used static parallel coordinates plots which often limited their axes to the modeling results management concerns only this is mainly due to the complexity of this figure too many axes will significantly reduce its readability the dynamic parallel coordinates plot from d3 can overcome this limitation by showing all key drivers and management concerns in one plot while using the brushing function to enhance readability through the brushing interaction users can select a range of drivers and highlight their effect on all concerns this plot can also be used backward following the concept of robust decision making lempert and collins 2007 and decision scaling brown 2010 to allow users to select a range of concerns and back trace a scenario that causes a problematic situation 3 scenario setup 3 1 management concerns there are a variety of management concerns involved due to conflicting interests within great ruaha river basin a system analysis approach is applied to simulate the various management concerns as a multi objective water allocation problem the three representative management concerns simulated in this study are 1 upstream water deficit for rice irrigation food 2 middle stream number of zero flow days at the ihefu outlet water and 3 downstream annual hydropower production at mtera and kidatu energy the irrigation water deficit was defined as the difference between the actual water applied to rice affected by water withdrawal and irrigation efficiency and potential crop water requirement this is a major concern for farmers as most of the rice production requires irrigation throughout the growing season october to july the number of zero flow days at the ihefu wetland s outlet i e ngiriama is a key ecological concern for the rnp the number of zero flow days is used as an indicator for the health of the great ruaha river a recent study done by sweco 2015 concluded that the reduced inflow to the mtera reservoir likely due to the upstream water withdrawal for irrigation is the primary reason for the low hydropower generation from mtera and kidatu reservoir for the past decade hydropower generation from mtera and kidatu is a major concern of the country s energy security 3 2 drivers and measures two drivers that affect the three management concerns described in the previous section are presented here 1 crop area changes and 2 streamflow change we also introduce two major measures that can be considered to mitigate negative impacts of the drivers 1 irrigation efficiency improvement and 2 water infrastructure development according to the satellite image based crop area data our analysis used three historical crop area expansion rates i e for the 1998 2013 trend the 2004 2013 trend and the 2008 2013 trend to project a future crop area expansion increasing crop area will add additional stresses to this water limited system detailed calculation of crop area increases is given in the supplement materials the model also tests a scenario if the crop area inside the rnp were removed this can be considered as a measure rather than a driver the upstream flow from the southern kipengere mountain area to the system is another driver that affect all management concerns changing streamflow can be seen as a proxy for different scenarios such as climate change which can result in either increase or decrease of streamflow and upstream domestic water use increases the model systematically changes the inflow from 20 to 20 compared to the baseline which explained later in the text with 10 interval and checks its impact on all management concerns we use a simple delta change method to increase or decrease the 10 day streamflow from the hbv model for the entire modeling period this is because we only focus on the total volume change impact on the downstream water uses rather than the impact of streamflow timing change future studies can further explore the impact of streamflow timing change on all management concerns through verbal communication with farmers and our own visual inspection of the channel condition during the field trip we confirmed that the current irrigation system is water constrained and the average irrigation efficiency is about 25 which is in line with the range of 20 30 from previous studies e g smuwc 2001 due to insufficient design or poor maintenance therefore we use the water system model to evaluate the impact of system wide irrigation efficiency levels i e efficiency improvements by 40 60 and 80 are considered to mitigate management concerns in this study we defined irrigation efficiency as the ratio between actual water used to satisfy crop water requirement and total water withdrawals this sensitive analysis is useful to inform decision makers about a certain level of irrigation efficiency that investment plans should try to reach during the field visit water infrastructure dams and weirs development proposals were also suggested by several stakeholders thus we made water infrastructure development as another measure proposed projects included a v notch weir or a gated weir at the outlet of ihefu wetland the v notch weir is not a control weir but minimal release can be setup for the gated weir releases of one and two cubic meters per second cms for the gated weir were tested in the model a summary of these drivers measures is given in table 1 models are run for all combinations of these drivers measures and these combinations are defined as scenarios for example the baseline scenario is current crop land current efficiency no water infrastructure current streamflow in total 400 scenarios were run 4 result 4 1 impacts of individual driver and measure the box whisker charts are used to demonstrate the effect of single driver and measure on three major management concerns with the range of uncertainty caused by others the baseline scenario all drivers and measures are current as described in section 3 2 is used as a basis and the percentage change of management concerns are shown as the length of the box fig 3 shows crop area expansion clearly has a stronger negative effect on irrigation deficits since more crop area will require more water to irrigate when inflow water supply is the same more demand irrigation will result in more deficits under the current crop area baseline the irrigation deficits have a general decreasing pattern due to the effect of measures however under the 98 13 trend for example all positive effect of these measures will be offset by crop area expansion fig 3a this means if the crop area expansion follows the most extreme pattern no measure can reduce the current irrigation deficits a similar pattern was found for the zero flow days but the negative effect of crop area expansion is relatively smaller compared to irrigation deficits this is because ihefu wetland still serves as a buffer for zero flow days hydropower will not be significantly affected when crop area is expanded the range of all boxes are between 18 and 19 this is because we can only correctly model hydropower generation at annual scale and both ihefu wetland and mtera reservoir have water storage to buffer the impact at annual scale fig 3b shows the effect of inflow change indicating fairly linear trends for all three management concerns when inflows to the system change from 20 to 20 irrigation deficits and zero flow days will systematically decrease while hydropower generation will systematically increase fig 4 shows the effect of two measures irrigation efficiency improvement and water infrastructure development increasing the irrigation efficiency systematically reduces the irrigation deficit and the number of zero flow days fig 4a this measure also reduces the uncertainty range of these boxes because irrigated demands can be satisfied with less inflow under higher efficiency for example the irrigation deficit ranges from 67 to 63 under 60 efficiency compared to the baseline efficiency which causes the irrigation deficiency to range from 44 to 146 this measure can also significantly reduce the number of zero flow days however some outliers still remain indicating that improving irrigation efficiency alone cannot guarantee the complete elimination of the zero flow days in the ihefu wetland fig 4b shows the effect of water infrastructure no effect has been found for the irrigation deficits because these proposed infrastructures are located downstream of the major crop areas also no effect has been reported on the annual hydropower generation due to the fact that these infrastructures were designed to change the timing of the flow within a year however significant effects on the number of zero flow days are observed unlike the previous measure even outliers on the box chart are located below the 0 line meaning that these infrastructures can almost guarantee the improvement of zero flow day conditions in the ihefu wetland under all other uncertainties 4 2 evaluating combination effects for policy informing we developed dynamic parallel coordinates plots using the d3 which consists of a series of parallel axes representing the different drivers and their combination effects on management concerns in the parallel coordinates plots each of the 400 scenarios is represented by a line that intersects with the driver axes a table accompanied by the plot presents values of drivers measures and the three management concerns corresponding to the individual scenario the d3 based parallel coordinates plots enable users to interact with it directly when users click on the title of one axis the individual line adopts a different color varying through blue purple and red in fig 5 a the irrigation deficits axis is selected red lines represent higher irrigation deficits and blue lines represent lower irrigation deficits once the user has selected one axis the user can see how closely another axis correlates to the selected axis by seeing if the lines have arranged themselves in a similar color pattern when they cross the second axis for example in fig 5a crop area expansion and high irrigation efficiency appear to be the most sensitive driver and measure of irrigation deficit most lines connected with crop area expansion are red and most lines connected with the efficiency levels of 60 and 80 are blue this result provides an intuitive confirmation for agricultural water management when the user clicks on the hydropower axis the pattern of red and blue lines changed fig 5b this result shows that if we focus on hydropower inflow appears to be the most sensitive driver since most red lines higher hydropower generation are associated with inflow increase double clicking on an axis changes the sorting method from ascending to descending or vice versa for example when users double click on the axes for irrigation deficits and zero flow days all three management concern axes will have their preferred management target on top fig 5c this setting becomes similar to the demonstration in kasprzyk et al 2009 and herman et al 2014 whenever lines across two management concerns have a trade off in our example we have found some lines across each other but due to the large number of scenarios it might not be convenient to capture the potential trade off therefore we rely on the brushing function of the d3 which can filter out irrelevant scenarios to further inform policy makers users can select an acceptable range i e decision or policy threshold for each management concern axis fig 6 a then the plot will only show the scenarios that fit within the indicated thresholds the corresponding table will simultaneously update with a list of the highlighted scenarios following the concept of the robust decision making or decision scaling these highlighted scenarios set up boundaries on drivers and measures to assist in negotiation between decision makers assuming the minister of agriculture states that 150 million cubic meters of water per year is acceptable irrigation deficits the minister of energy feels that an annual hydropower production of 1 3 twh per year is acceptable the director of the rnp feels that in order to reach the park s ecological goals s he will not be satisfied with more than 5 zero flow days each year fig 6a provides a clear message to all decision makers that these thresholds cannot all be met if the crop area follows the 1998 2013 or 2004 2013 increasing trend if the irrigation efficiency is not improved if no water infrastructure is built or if the inflow is at the historical level or less if all three decision makers insist their decision thresholds following the example of fig 6a funding will be needed to improve irrigation efficiency to at least 40 water infrastructure is needed at ihefu wetland and crop area expansion needs to be regulated furthermore inflow needs to increase at least 10 which is out of human control without transboundary water diversion the brushing function then provides an easy way for users to change their highlighted range as part of a negotiation or compromise for example if the director of the rnp can accept 20 zero flow days per year fig 6b s he just needs to extend the selected range and more scenarios will show up in the plot with the corresponding table under this new decision threshold the largest difference is that water infrastructures become an optional choice to satisfy all three concerns although irrigation improvement crop area expansion regulation and more inflow are still needed this example demonstrates the capability of the dynamic parallel coordinates plot and its corresponding table a live link of this plot is given at http www lehigh edu yey217 tanparallel html this plot is modified from kai chang s example https syntagmatic github io parallel coordinates examples table html 4 3 economic aspect of the wef nexus kadigi et al 2008 and mccartney et al 2007 provided useful estimations for economic analysis of water energy and ecosystem resources in the great ruaha river basin in this section we use their economic estimations to evaluate the simplified economic aspect of the wef nexus note that we do not incorporate a complex hydro economic model such as those in george et al 2011a and yang et al 2016a but assume fixed social economic values for agricultural energy and ecosystem water uses according to kadigi et al 2008 the average gross value of the crop land is 64 9 usd per ha we use this number to estimate the cost needed to remove the crop area inside the rnp the average value of consumed water was estimated as 0 04 usd per m3 in kadigi et al 2008 and we adopt this value to calculate the change of agricultural profit due to the irrigation deficits change the value of water needed for rnp and the ihefu wetland including water for fisheries beekeeping and riverine ecosystem etc is 9 7 million usd per year mccartney et al 2007 while the daily cost of 26 600 usd is used to estimate the losses resulting from zero flow days note that we do not include the economic value of livestock grazing in the ihefu wetland in our analysis since we want to emphasize the ecological aspect of rnp the electricity value of 0 0656 usd per kwh kadigi et al 2008 mccartney et al 2007 is used to calculate the profit for hydropower generation we apply these values to the modeling results and calculate the overall economic value changes relative to the baseline scenario table 2 shows the effects of the drivers and measures with minimal average and maximal values the crop area change inflow change and irrigation efficiency improvement have significant economic effect in the system except for water infrastructures this is because water infrastructures have no effect on irrigation deficits and hydropower generation which are two major sources of economic values table 2 also provides the information of necessary conditions in order to gain a system wide economic profit if we treat the average values as expected economic gains the middle one in table 2 the crop area expansion should not be larger than the trend of 2008 2013 the inflow cannot be lower than the current condition and the irrigation efficiency should be improved at least by 40 either one of these can result in positive expected economic gains finally the minimal values under all conditions are negative meaning that no single driver or measure can guarantee positive economic gains under the uncertainties table 2 can be broken down into social economic value changes resulting from agriculture hydropower and rnp we use a d3 dynamic scatter plot matrix to show these result fig 7 a shows economic value changes of these aspects in three of the nine plots those on the diagonal the x axis is the same as the y axis resulting in all 400 data points falling on a 45 line note that upper three plots and lower three plots are the same except switching between x axis and y axis in these plots users can see a positive relationship between all three value changes agriculture and hydropower have the strongest relationship agriculture vs rnp and hydropower vs rnp also have positive relationships although not as strong as agriculture vs hydropower these results mean that in this particular case the economic value of agriculture hydropower and rnp will be affected in the same way when we consider impacts of drivers or how measures can mitigate impacts of drivers in other words if economic value is used as the objective for the project no tradeoff relationship exist in this study area even with no trade off relationship shown in the figure users can still brush the plots to explore the effect of decision thresholds on each of these economic value changes as an example let s say that the minister of agriculture and the minister of energy both want at least positive economic changes in their own sectors using the brushing function the two ministers can select a rectangle on the agriculture vs hydropower plot upper center that satisfies both of their requirements fig 7b brushing this area highlights the dots representing the scenarios that meet both of their requirements the scenarios that do not meet their requirements turn gray in all nine scatter plots in this example none of the selected dots is orange this indicates that it would be difficult to achieve positive economic value in both agriculture and hydropower if the crop area expansion follows the 1998 2013 trend under the assumption that the director of the rnp also wish to maintain at least positive economic value changes the dashed line in the third row of the matrix in fig 7b the decisions made by the minister of agriculture and energy satisfy this requirement since all colored dots are located above the dashed line this tool can help facilitate negotiation and compromise among decision makers this example demonstrates the capability of dynamic scatters plot matrix a live link of this plot is given at http www lehigh edu yey217 tanscatter html this plot is modified mike bostock s example http bl ocks org mbostock 4063663 5 discussion there are several uncertainties regarding the current coupled modeling framework and results in this paper we discuss some major uncertain sources in this section to highlight the limitation of our approach and provide suggestions for future follow up studies first data uncertainty stems from four different sources precipitation and temperature data for the hbv hydrologic model input observed streamflow and water level data for the hbv and water system model calibration water sources data for each irrigation scheme and economic value for water uses in different sectors precipitation and temperature data from reanalysis outputs dceepu 2006 might not be suitable for the 10 day time step since the data were bias corrected at the monthly level the streamflow observation is questionable because the rating curve at each gauge station varies through time satellite image based water level data were only validated with water logger after 2008 actual water sources for irrigation scheme cannot be lumped at subbasin scale in reality therefore further division of irrigation scheme is necessary to better capture the actual irrigation pattern value for economic estimation per volumetric water use will affect results of economic analysis and the follow up decision making e g fig 7 this complies with the remark from mccartney et al 2007 that research intent to inform policy should not just consider monetary values second model structure uncertainty contains three different aspects the empirical equation for the floodplain module equations to describe the hydrologic processes in the ihefu wetland and the operational rules for mtera and kidatu due to the very limited data for the usangu plains the inflow outflow relationship currently used is empirical while the water balance is maintained but the storage changes inside the flood plain are ignored in the model the ihefu wetland s storage surface area water level relationship is also highly uncertain previous modeling studies have different equations kashaigili et al 2006 mow 2015 smuwc 2001 wrem 2013 wwf 2010 furthermore no standard mtera and kidatu operational rule can be followed in reality therefore the model uses empirical equations to capture the water level fluctuation and annual hydropower generation for these two reservoirs third parameter uncertainty contains two different aspects the trend of water use efficiency and parameter equifinality beven 2005 that means in open systems a given end state can be reached by many potential means the trend of water use efficiency is not currently captured in the model since only one parameter is used for the entire simulation period equifinality issue in our case means that different sets of the parameter can result in similar model performances since the system is highly non linear because of the uncertainties the results of this study are only indicative however the model performance and results concur generally with ground information and with visual inspection of the situation in the usangu plains during the field trip there may be errors in individual numerical sub results as equifinality can have caused compensatory errors but it is likely that the overall description of the system and the indicated impacts of different measures are generally correct further ground surveys are needed to improve and update the system analysis model a more detailed survey and description on the irrigation areas the exact position of intakes main canals and drainage are top priorities also a more detailed topographical survey of the ihefu wetland is necessary to understand the water storage area relation and the discharge capacity at the ngiriama weir 6 conclusion the decreasing trend of streamflows during the last decades in the great ruaha river flowing through the usangu plains and the ruaha national park rnp in southern tanzania is a typical case for water energy food nexus competition in the sub saharan africa region utilizing the recently available remote sensing data for the crop area expansion and the water level in the ihefu wetland in rnp this study develops a coupled modeling framework that explicitly quantifies natural and human components in the great ruaha river system we calibrated the coupled model based on the pooled calibration with multiple targets streamflow water depth and hydropower generation and used an interactive web based visualization tool to communicate our scientific findings with non technical practitioners the results of the system modeling show that there is no simple solution to mitigate the ephemeral character of the great ruaha river in the national park no single measure such as improved water efficiency a reasonable reduction in irrigation area or even a low head weir at wetland outlet can completely remove zero flows in the rnp building a higher weir at ngiriama will likely solve the problem but will be costly and may have significant ecological impacts since such infrastructure will yield no increased hydropower production the high costs are difficult to be justified from an economic point of view similarly a massive reduction of rice irrigation areas in the usangu plains would likely minimize the period of zero flows in the park but would not be socio economically acceptable a combination of measures each acceptable from a social and economic perspective and accepting that zero flows cannot be totally eliminated during dry years are likely to be the best way forward the combination of irrigation efficiency improvements a modest reduction of irrigation areas improved productivity through agriculture management and a low head weir at ngiriama could significantly reduce the number of days of zero flows and will result in limited if any reduction in rice crop yields these measures are all relatively cost efficient and can possibly be economically motivated by an increased hydropower production at the mtera and kidatu plants further studies are required to improve the prediction of impacts of different mitigation measures ground surveys on the irrigation areas intakes main canals and drainages points as well as topographical surveys of the ihefu wetland and the ngiriama weir would improve the reliability of the simulated effects on downstream flows the possible design of a low weir at ngiriama needs to be studied from an engineering point of view to include viable technical options in the model acknowledgements the

11601,accurate continuous measurements of temperature t apparent electrical conductivity eca apparent dielectric permittivity εra and volumetric water content θv are extremely valuable to irrigation management and other agronomic decisions the performance of eight electromagnetic em sensors tdr315 cs655 hydraprobe2 5te ec5 cs616 field connect aquacheck were analyzed through a field study in a loam soil t eca and εra were compared in reference to overall average among all sensors and θv in reference to a neutron moisture meter nmm the reported t and eca difference among the sensors were within 1 c and 1dsm 1 respectively at 0 15 and 0 76m depths among the single sensor probes the range of depth combined 0 15 and 0 76m rmsd for factory calibration varied from 0 039m3 m 3 5te to 0 157m3 m 3 cs616 in comparison to single sensor probes rmsd of field connect at combined depths 0 30 and 0 51m was moderate 0 083m3 m 3 and rmsd of aquacheck at combined depths 0 30 and 0 61m was high 0 163m3 m 3 regression calibrations improved θv accuracy substantially beyond factory calibrations as rmsd of the evaluated sensors except field connect was below 0 025m3 m 3 using regression calibrations the betterment in θv accuracy gained by using offset calibrations was smaller and less consistent than the improvements gained by using regression calibrations the lower and upper bounds of the 95 confidence interval for mean rmsd of most sensors were below 0 02 and 0 04m3 m 3 respectively when using depth specific offset calibrations the relative success of offset calibrations for certain sensors in this study is encouraging and may signal new opportunities because much of the uncertainty in sensor reported θv for the sensors under evaluation was systematic future work should aim to develop universal calibrations or facilitate site specific calibrations keywords calibration capacitance electrical conductivity neutron permittivity soil water content 1 introduction accurate determination of soil water quantity and quality can better inform the timing and depth of irrigation applications and reduce the likelihood of excessively or insufficiently irrigating excessive irrigation increases fertilizer and irrigation pumping costs as well as generates additional nitrate leaching and greenhouse gas emissions furthermore by subjecting soil and plant canopies to frequent and prolonged wet conditions excessive irrigation can decrease harvestable yield due to greater occurrence and severity of disease anaerobic soil conditions nutrient deficiencies and inability to operate farm machinery on the opposite extreme inadequate soil water as a result of insufficient irrigation limits transpiration and photosynthesis and in turn hinders crop growth and yield potential doorenbos and kassam 1979 measurements of soil water quantity is arguably the most necessary geophysical estimate for implementing deficit irrigation in which crop water status is carefully managed to maximize grain yield with a limited water supply geerts and raes 2009 although most attention in irrigation scheduling is focused on soil water quantity soil water quality likewise deserves consideration measurements of soil salinity can guide the use of irrigation to leach salts out of the crop root zone to maintain soil salinity levels within a crop s tolerable range u s salinity laboratory and staff 1954 limited irrigation can be applied if rescue fertilizer applications are undesired or infeasible based on the detection of nutrient stressed crops rudnick and irmak 2014 observed a reduction in corn evapotranspiration et when the crops were subjected to nitrogen stress irrigation exceeding a crop s et rate can cause further reduction in nutrient availability through leaching and consequently affect grain yield and the environment repeated nondestructive measurement of soil water status is ideal because temporal trends can be determined without the potentially confounding influence of soil spatial variability neutron moisture meter nmm is the current standard to measure accurate repeated and non destructive field volumetric water content θv chanasyk and naeth 1996 and if calibrated with respect to thermogravimetric method it can be used to compare other soil water monitoring devices leib et al 2003 however the nmm is not typically an option for on farm management or collecting high spatiotemporal dense data due to the radioactive source which requires proper training licensing and safety measures when handling storing and transporting the instrument rudnick et al 2015 since electromagnetic em properties of soil vary with θv various em sensors that can be installed into the soil to provide continuous measurement of soil water quantity have been developed tested and adopted over the last several decades some of these em sensors also measure apparent electrical conductivity eca and temperature t these extra capabilities undoubtedly broaden the applicability of em sensors in both research and production scenarios for example measurement of eca can be used to monitor soil salinity rhoades et al 1976 if calibrated using saturation extract electrical conductivity ece and to monitor nitrate nitrogen no3 n concentrations in soil and water payero et al 2006 temperature is a key environmental variable for plants during the vegetative period as it affects time of emergence schneider and gupta 1985 and grain yield bollero et al 1996 however merely deploying em sensors and amassing a large dataset does not guarantee improvements in research and management predictive models revealing findings and better informed decisions require accuracy in soil water quantity and quality data despite commonalities among em sensors some studies have shown that the distinctions in measurement technology design installation method internal adjustments and factory calibration could culminate in substantial disparities in θv measurement accuracy across sensors varble and chávez 2011 chavez and evett 2012 mittelbach et al 2012 vaz et al 2013 it is imperative that these disparities among sensors are recognized to identify appropriate sensors across regions and applications and develop improved calibrations a field study was conducted to analyze the performance of eight em sensors tdr315 cs655 hydraprobe2 5te ec5 cs616 field connect and aquacheck in a loam soil of west central nebraska this field study was designed to generate new peer reviewed information on em sensors whose performance to our knowledge have scarcely been reported in the literature e g cs655 tdr315 aquacheck and field connect kisekka et al 2014 rudnick et al 2015 zeelie 2015 schwartz et al 2016 as well as supplement the body of knowledge on the performance of em sensors that have been widely studied in the literature e g hydraprobe2 5te ec5 and cs616 ojo et al 2014 2015 rüdiger et al 2010 udawatta et al 2011 varble and chávez 2011 mittelbach et al 2012 across diverse settings results of this field study may be somewhat directly transferable to similar environments useful for meta analyses in understanding sensor performance between divergent environments and laying a foundation for future research the specific objectives of the research were to 1 evaluate factory calibrations of the em sensors for t eca apparent dielectrical permittivity εra and θv and 2 compare the factory calibration for θv against two custom calibration approaches the first a conventional approach based on regression and the second an offset approach based on one known data point 2 material and methods 2 1 site soil and experiment descriptions a field experiment was conducted at the university of nebraska lincoln west central research and extension center wcrec in north platte ne 41 1 n 100 8 w and 861m above sea level during the 2016 growing season the research site is located in a semi arid climate zone with average annual precipitation and standardized alfalfa reference et ewri 2005 of 514 and 1530mm respectively hprcc 2016 ncdc 2015 the research was performed with soybean at 0 76m spacing planted on may 26 2016 during the study period which was 28 july to 5 september 2016 three significant rain events occurred 31mm on 28 july 17mm on 11 august and 9mm on 26 august textural composition organic matter content omc and bulk density ρb were determined at soil depth intervals of 0 15m from 0 08 to 0 84m table 1 a pit was dug between two rows of soybeans single sensor probes were inserted into one of the pit walls so that the prongs were oriented horizontally and located directly underneath a single row of soybeans two replicates of the following sensors 5te ec5 hydraprobe2 cs616 cs655 and tdr315 were installed at a depth of 0 15m and two replicates of the same sensors were installed at a depth of 0 76m at each depth the arrangement of the sensors along the soybean row was randomized and the sensors were 0 15m apart from each other this spacing was chosen so that every sensor was outside the measurement volumes of the other sensors the sensor outputs were recorded every hour in addition two replicates of the field connect and aquacheck probes and four replicates of nmm aluminum access tubes were installed in the crop row neighboring the aforementioned sensors all sensors were installed following manufacturer recommendations and allowed to equilibrate with the surrounding soil prior to the start of the study 2 2 description of sensors 2 2 1 tdr315 the acclima tdr315 acclima inc meridian id is a time domain reflectometer with three parallel rods serving as the waveguide the sensor head has all necessary electronics and firmware to generate an em pulse and construct a waveform to determine the propagation time of the em wave which is used to estimate εra the sensor is equipped with a thermistor to measure soil t tdr315 measures eca based on giese and tiemann method giese and tiemann 1975 like conventional tdr equipment a proprietary dielectric mixing model is used to estimate θv from εra however topp equation eq 1 topp et al 1980 was considered for determination of θv from εra reported by tdr315 as well 1 θv 4 3 10 6 εra 3 5 5 10 4 εra 2 2 92 10 2 εra 5 3 10 2 2 2 2 cs616 and cs655 the campbell scientific cs616 and cs655 campbell scientific inc logan ut are water content reflectometers with two parallel rods forming an open ended transmission line the sensors measure the two way travel time of an em pulse to determine a period average the cs616 uses a quadratic equation relating period average to calculate θv whereas the cs655 uses a factory calibrated empirical model involving voltage ratio and period average to determine εra and then estimates θv from εra using the topp equation eq 1 the cs655 sensor also measures soil t using a thermistor and eca by determining the ratio between the excitation voltage and the measured voltage the manufacturer s t adjustment was also considered for cs616 by using t measurements by cs655 2 2 3 hydraprobe2 the stevens hydraprobe2 stevens water monitoring systems inc portland or is an impedance sensor with three tines surrounding one center tine it measures real εr and imaginary εr dieletric permittivity separately from the response of a reflected standing em wave at a radio frequency of 50mhz the εr is used to estimate θv using a square root mixing model whereas εr is used to estimate eca in addition topp equation eq 1 was considered for determination of θv from εr reported by hydraprobe2 as well this sensor also measures soil t using a thermistor the default θv calibration which is the loam calibration is stated to be suitable for most medium textured soils and therefore was used in this study 2 2 4 5te and ec5 the decagon devices 5te and ec5 decagon devices inc pullman wa are a three and two pronged capacitance sensor respectively and are designed to use an oscillator running at 70mhz frequency to measure εra the 5te sensor estimates θv from εra using the topp equation eq 1 whereas the ec5 sensor uses a linear calibration equation to determine εra and θv from output voltage however topp equation eq 1 was considered for determination of θv from εra reported by ec5 as well the 5te sensor also measures soil t using a thermistor that is in thermal contact with the sensor prongs as well as eca using screws on the surface of the sensor to form a two sensor electrical array 2 2 5 multi sensor capacitance probes the multi sensor capacitance probes used in this study were the john deere field connect deere company moline il and aquacheck classic probe aquacheck ltd durbanville south africa each sensor along the probe shaft emits an em field into the soil the reported count which is proportional to the sensor circuit resonant frequency is used to calculate a scaled frequency the scaled frequency is then converted to θv field connect performs this conversion using a proprietary calibration procedure and each probe has sensors located at depths of 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 5 and 1 0m for aquacheck the conversion was not built in but the manufacturer provided six equations five soil specific and one generic the five texture specific equations were each generated from field calibrations in south africa whereas the generic equation used the pooled data from three soil types sand silt loam and clay zeelie 2015 according to the textural classification of the soil loam calibration was selected for conversion of scaled frequency to θv and generic calibration was selected as well one version of aquacheck probes was included in this study with sensors located at depths of 0 10 0 20 0 30 0 41 0 61 and 0 81m 2 2 6 neutron moisture meter the neutron moisture meter nmm used in this study was a cpn 503dr hydroprobe moisture neutron depth gauge campbell pacific nuclear international inc concord ca a nmm is comprised of a nuclear source and detector the nuclear source is lowered into an access tube at a desired depth 0 15 0 30 0 46 0 76 and 0 91m where high energy neutrons are emitted into the soil and thermalized slowed down by colliding with hydrogen atoms the thermalized low energy neutrons are counted by a helium 3 detector and are compared against a standard count to estimate θv from a linear calibration equation with slope a and intercept b 2 θ v a n e u t r o n c o u n t s t a n d a r d c o u n t b the standard count is used to monitor the performance and verify that the nmm is operating without faults a nmm is not typically sensitive to changes in t and salinity evett et al 2006 however it can be influenced by omc clay content soil texture and chemical elements hauser 1984 and therefore a site specific calibration of a nmm is recommended a site specific calibration of the cpn 503dr nmm was performed for this study ordinary least squares regression was used to fit a linear calibration equation between observed neutron count ratios and thermo gravimetrically determined θv of 21 intact soil samples ranging between 0 104 and 0 302m3 m 3 from the depths 0 15 0 30 0 46 0 61 0 76 and 0 91m the soil samples used for the calibration were collected within 2m of the investigated sensors the resulting calibration root mean squared difference rmsd evaluated with the calibration dataset was 0 007m3 m 3 and the coefficient of determination r2 was 0 99 2 3 analysis in this study temperature t apparent electrical conductivity eca apparent dielectric permittivity εra and volumetric water content θv were analyzed with emphasis on θv determined from all the single sensor and multi sensor probes among the sensors under evaluation tdr315 cs655 hydraprobe2 and 5te reported εra as well as t and eca apart from θv εra was also reported by ec5 t eca and εra reported by each sensor were compared with the average reported values for these parameters among all sensors at depths of 0 15 and 0 76m to investigate the comparability of these parameters amongst different sensors the purpose of such analyses was to determine how closely these parameters t eca and εra were reported by different sensors rather than an accuracy assessment because eca reported by 5te have been automatically normalized to 25 c decagon devices 2016 eca reported by tdr315 cs655 and hydraprobe2 were manually normalized to 25 c for consistency using eq 3 campbell scientific 2016 3 e c a 25 e c a 1 0 02 t 25 where eca 25 dsm 1 is the apparent electrical conductivity after normalization to 25 c eca dsm 1 is the apparent electrical conductivity before normalization to 25 c and t is the soil temperature at time and space of apparent electrical conductivity measurement c average mean deviation amd eq 4 of the sensor reported values of t eca and εra from the corresponding overall average of all em sensors was computed from the data pairs considered in the analysis each data pair consisted of an average sensor reported parameter t eca or εra and overall average among all sensors at a certain time amd was calculated as 4 a m d i n s i m i n where i is the index of the data pairs n is the number of data pairs si is the sensor reported value of the ith data pair and mi is the mean of all sensors of the ith data pair the field calibrated nmm was used as the reference for θv following bell et al 1987 leib et al 2003 and rudnick et al 2015 on each of 14 dates during the study period a 16 s nmm reading was collected at each of five depths 0 15 0 30 0 51 0 61 and 0 76m in each of four access tubes the reference value of θv at a given depth on a given date was obtained by averaging the four readings one from each tube at that depth on that date besides the default factory calibrations for the em sensors alternate calibrations were explored for some of the sensors the topp equation eq 1 was considered for tdr315 hydraprobe2 and ec5 sensor reported and reference θv values for each sensor were compared at two depths 0 15 and 0 76m for single sensor probes 0 30 and 0 51m for field connect 0 30 and 0 61m for aquacheck separately and combined the sensor reported θv recorded at the time closest to each nmm reading always within one hour was considered and the pair of sensor reported θv and reference θv formed a set of comparison for the analysis several statistics were calculated to summarize each set of comparisons the mean difference md eq 5 and standard deviation of difference sdd eq 6 of the sensor reported values from corresponding reference values were calculated the equations for calculating md eq 5 and amd eq 4 are similar however md compares sensor reported θv against the reference nmm average θv whereas amd compares sensor reported parameter t eca or εra against the overall average parameter t eca or εra among all sensors the root mean squared difference rmsd on the other hand was the commonly computed indicator of the absolute magnitude of the differences between sensor reported and reference values while penalizing larger differences eq 7 5 m d i n s i r i n 6 s d d i n s i r i m d 2 n 1 7 r m s d i n s i r i 2 n where i is the index of the data pairs n is the number of data pairs si is the sensor reported value of the ith data pair and ri is the reference value of the ith data pair for θv two types of custom calibrations were developed to compare with the factory calibration the first type was regression calibration of sensor reported values to reference values a linear model and a quadratic model were considered in every case to obtain a more conservative rmsd value for comparison with the factory calibration the rmsd of each model was calculated using the leave one out cross validation loocv approach instead of comparing each reference value against the model fitted using all data pairs in loocv rmsd calculations each reference value was compared against the model fitted using all data pairs except the pair to which the particular reference value belonged the model with the smaller loocv rmsd was selected loocv rmsd was reported with the best fit coefficient estimates of the selected model according to ordinary least squares with all data pairs included calculations were conducted in statistical computing language r r version 3 3 2 r foundation for statistical computing wein austria the second type of custom calibration for θv was offset calibration based on one known data pair this type of calibration would be performed by making one highly accurate e g thermo gravimetric or nmm θv measurement to determine a constant offset with which to shift all other sensor reported θv values as a simulation an offset was calculated as the difference of the sensor reported value from the corresponding reference value of one data pair and that offset was subtracted from the sensor reported values of all other data pairs the rmsd between the shifted sensor reported values and the reference values of those data pairs was calculated and the process was repeated until every data pair had been used to calculate the offset exactly once with the number of rmsd values equal to the number of data pairs a 95 confidence interval of the mean rmsd based on the student s t distribution was computed using the t test function in statistical computing language r 3 results 3 1 temperature weather and time of day caused daily soil t fluctuations with large amplitudes at the shallower depth 0 15m but were dampened and integrated into roughly weekly fluctuations with small amplitudes at the deeper soil depth 0 76m fig 1 each em sensor average was compared against the average of all em sensors the comparisons above would suggest that two of the same or different em sensors could be expected to report t values generally within 1 c of each other when subjected to the same environmental conditions therefore the investigated sensors would be able to differentiate for example soil t between coulter planting and conventional planting which has been reported to have a mean difference as low as 2 2 c griffith et al 1973 such comparability among sensors provides confidence that the sensors can be used for crop modeling and planting decisions 3 2 apparent electrical conductivity eca in general all sensors had a decreasing trend in eca over time and appeared to follow the wetting and drying cycle of the soil it was observed that following a wetting event precipitation of 17mm on 11 august there was an increase in eca fig 2 the 0 15m soil depth responded more to wetting events as compared to the 0 76m soil depth a comparison for each em sensor average eca against the average eca of all em sensors was made the range for reported eca among all sensors at both depths was within 1dsm 1 within the observed range of eca for the em sensors hydraprobe2 and cs655 reported eca were comparable to the overall average at both depths seyfried and murdock 2004 compared eca measurements by hydraprobe and by a conductivity electrode calibrated with standard solutions they found that the two sensors reported similar eca values in kcl solutions between 0 1 5dsm 1 but there was an accuracy deterioration with increasing solution eca and concentration logdson et al 2010 reported that measured ec by hydraprobe was very similar to theoretical ec for fluids and suggested that an adjustment was needed in the hydraprobe reported eca to account for dielectric relaxation in soils at 0 76m depth where the eca reported by other sensors was within the range 0 16 0 92dsm 1 the two 5te replicates were essentially nonresponsive and only reported eca between 0 00 and 0 03dsm 1 the contrasting performance of 5te sensors at both depths relative to other sensors was unlikely due to defective sensors because the differences were consistent across replicates and depths chavez and evett 2012 reported an underestimation of eca for 5te sensor by about 35 in comparison to conventional tdr however schwartz et al 2013 witnessed that eca reported by 5te sensor was very similar to eca reported by conventional tdr 3 3 apparent dielectric permittivity εra similar to the temporal trends in eca all sensors had a decreasing trend in εra over time and followed the wetting and drying cycle of the soil where εra increased following a wetting event fig 3 as expected the 0 15m soil depth responded more to wetting events as compared to the 0 76m soil depth since the near surface soil is subjected to more transient water dynamics as compared with lower soil depths according to rudnick and irmak 2014 cross comparison amongst εra reported by different em sensors was made with the average εra of all em sensors the amd within reported εra spanned across a wide range at shallower depth 6 01 12 84 and a narrow range at deeper depth 3 08 6 72 comparatively with the observed range of εra within 10 50 40 99 at 0 15m and 6 56 28 55 at 0 76m depth table 2 the hydraprobe2 sensor recorded the largest average εra difference with respect to the overall average the difference was consistent for both the replications in comparison to the overall average at two depths this remarkable difference in εra was possibly due to differences in operating measurement frequency amongst sensors seyfried and murdock 2004 synthesized the findings of multiple researchers on the differences between soil permittivity measured at around 1ghz typical for tdr and at 50mhz default for hydraprobe2 they claimed that the real εr and imaginary εr dieletric permittivity and consequently εra of soils except sands were often larger at 50mhz than at around 1ghz if this interpretation holds true it would not be appropriate to directly compare εra reported by sensors with different measurement frequencies 3 4 volumetric water content θv 3 4 1 temporal trends the study period could be characterized as a drying cycle that began with a 31mm rain on 28 july and was interrupted by a 17mm rain on 11 august and a 9mm rain on 26 august reference θv which was the average nmm θv from four access tubes ranged from 0 180 0 332m3 m 3 at 0 15m 0 173 0 260m3 m 3 at 0 30m 0 139 0 189m3 m 3 at 0 51m 0 130 0 192m3 m 3 at 0 61m and 0 131 0 214m3 m 3 at 0 76m with increasing depth the range of reference θv narrowed because deeper depths received less of infiltrated rainfall and contributed less to et as compared to shallower depths the differences between sensor reported and reference θv varied among sensors and over time fig 4 however for all evaluated sensors the factory calibrations and the considered alternate calibrations followed the general trend of reference θv all evaluated sensors nonetheless commonly overestimated θv relative to the reference using the topp equation eq 1 instead of the factory calibration improved the performance of tdr315 but not hydraprobe2 or the ec5 by switching to topp equation combined rmsd for tdr315 decreased by 0 013m3 m 3 whereas combined rmsd for hydraprobe and ec5 increased by 0 029 and 0 100m3 m 3 respectively the topp equation was developed using tdr topp et al 1980 and has been demonstrated to be applicable in many soils dane and topp 2002 thus the suitability of the topp equation for tdr315 was not surprising the likely overestimation of εra by hydraprobe2 is discussed in the previous subsection therefore applying the topp equation to εra based on hydraprobe2 measurements would tend to inflate the calculated θv matching the observations in the present study in fact overestimation of θv also occurred when vaz et al 2013 applied the topp equation to εr as measured by hydraprobe2 the influence of ambient t on cs616 has been described in the literature udawatta et al 2011 varble and chávez 2011 mittelbach et al 2012 in the present study cs616 reported θv at 0 15m using the factory calibration exhibited diurnal fluctuations in which θv appeared to decrease with decreasing soil t and increase with increasing soil t or and wraith 1999 attributed these diurnal fluctuations not to actual changes in θv but to both the volume fraction of bound water and the t effects on the permittivity of bulk water besides altering the em properties of the surrounding media t could also affect sensor electronics seyfried and grant 2007 the manufacturer s t adjustment however arguably did not improve the accuracy of cs616 reported θv in the present study when this adjustment was applied to the cs616 data at 0 15m the diurnal fluctuations was simultaneously reversed and amplified such an outcome may indicate overcompensation by the manufacturer s t adjustment which rüdiger et al 2010 noticed while the soil at the field site was a loam aquacheck reported θv was further from reference θv when using the loam calibration than when using the generic calibration loam was intermediate among the five soil textural classes for which a specific calibration was provided by the manufacturer yet the loam calibration was most unlike the other calibrations because the former computed a much higher θv when the same scaled frequency was measured as compared to the sites where the other calibrations were developed the site where the loam calibration was developed might have differed in one or more non textural soil properties that heavily impacted aquacheck response 3 4 2 factory calibration commonalities in performance statistics were found among the evaluated sensors table 3 md was positive for all evaluated sensors at all depths a result in agreement with the earlier finding that sensor reported θv was predominantly higher than reference θv except in the cases of cs655 and ec5 sdd never exceeded half of md at any depth or for combined data signifying that the deviations of sensor reported θv from reference θv for each of the other six sensors were rather consistent in direction and magnitude consequently rmsd mostly followed the patterns of md the performance statistics varied among depths md was smaller at the shallower depth and larger at the deeper depth for five sensors tdr315 5te ec5 field connect and aquacheck while the opposite was true for three sensors cs655 hydraprobe2 and cs616 except in the cases of tdr315 and ec5 sdd was similar at individual depths but larger for the combined data with rmsd ranging between 0 032 and 0 197m3 m 3 at individual depths and between 0 039 and 0 163m3 m 3 for combined data the evaluated sensors ranged between fair 0 05m3 m 3 rmsd 0 01m3 m 3 and very poor rmsd 0 1m3 m 3 on the accuracy scale of fares et al 2011 on the same scale the performance of field connect was poor 0 1m3 m 3 rmsd 0 05m3 m 3 and aquacheck was very poor rmsd 0 1m3 m 3 for combined data with the rmsd values of field connect and aquacheck as 0 083 and 0 163m3 m 3 respectively among the single sensor probes rmsd of 5te was smallest both at 0 15m and for combined data with values of 0 035 and 0 039m3 m 3 respectively whereas rmsd of cs655 was the smallest at 0 76m with a value of 0 032m3 m 3 rmsd of cs616 was the largest among the single sensor probes at both depths and combined 3 4 3 regression calibration out of the 24 regression calibration equations 5 were linear and 19 were quadratic fig 5 here polynomial order was selected by minimization of loocv rmsd and not by statistical significance tests with α 0 05 if the latter method was applied the regression calibration equations for cs616 at 0 76m and for field connect at 0 30m would be linear because the p value for the true quadratic coefficient being zero was 0 10 and 0 14 respectively for these two datasets interestingly the estimate of the intercept was greater than zero for all regression calibration equations in all linear calibration equations reference θv m sensor θv c the estimate of the linear coefficient m was positive but less than 1 hence the sensors to which these linear calibration equations were fitted were more sensitive than the reference the quadratic calibration equations on the other hand implied that sensitivity generally increased with θv within the observed θv range some of the regression calibration equations for θv were negatively sensitive under dry conditions and or highly sensitive under wet conditions at the minimum sensor value observed eight regression calibrations specify that increases in sensor reported θv would signify decreases in reference θv these calibrations are those for cs655 hydraprobe2 5te and ec5 at 0 15m field connect at 0 30m and for combined data and aquacheck at 0 61m and for combined data at the maximum sensor value observed six regression calibrations specify that one unit of increase in sensor reported θv would signify more than two units of increase in reference θv these calibrations are those for tdr315 5te and ec5 at 0 15m field connect for combined data and aquacheck at 0 30m and for combined data additional caution is therefore recommended when applying these equations with negative or high sensitivity regression calibrations led to substantial improvement in θv accuracy beyond factory calibration table 4 for example rmsd of cs616 exceeded by 0 10m3 m 3 at both depths when using factory calibration yet when using regression calibration rmsd of cs616 dropped below 0 02m3 m 3 for depth specific and combined data in general rmsd of the evaluated sensors were below 0 015m3 m 3 using depth specific regression calibrations and below 0 020m3 m 3 using combined regression calibrations the exceptions were cs655 at 0 15m and combined ec5 at 0 15m and combined and field connect at both depths and combined in these cases the two replicates of the same sensor tended to report noticeably different θv values at the same depth among all considered regression calibrations the combined regression calibration of field connect resulted in the largest rmsd of 0 026m3 m 3 3 4 4 offset calibration though the improvements in θv accuracy gained by using offset calibrations were smaller and less consistent than the improvements gained by using regression calibrations offset calibrations were nonetheless valuable for several sensors under evaluation table 4 for example rmsd of hydraprobe2 exceeded 0 10m3 m 3 at 0 15m and for combined data when using factory calibration using offset calibrations the upper bound of the confidence interval for mean rmsd of hydraprobe2 was below 0 03m3 m 3 at 0 15m and below 0 06m3 m 3 for combined data the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval for mean rmsd of most sensors were below 0 02 and 0 04m3 m 3 respectively when using depth specific offset calibrations for cs655 hydraprobe2 cs616 field connect and aquacheck using combined offset calibrations tended to result in higher rmsd than using depth specific offset calibrations the highest confidence interval for mean rmsd among all offset calibrations was 0 072 0 082m3 m 3 for cs655 with combined data an offset calibration determined the difference between sensor reported θv and reference θv for one data point and then shifted all other data points by that difference offset calibrations were therefore most beneficial if data points fitted tightly around one line whose slope was around 1 for example the distribution of all 5te data points generally matched one line with a slope of 1 so rmsd of both depth specific and combined offset calibrations were relatively low as for cs616 the distribution of 0 15m data points generally matched one line with a slope of 1 and the distribution of 0 76m data points generally matched a different line with slope of 1 the ultimate result was low rmsd for depth specific offset calibrations but high rmsd for combined offset calibrations offset calibrations could also be worse than factory calibrations if the differences from reference θv values were extremely variable among sensor reported θv values one instance was cs655 data points at 0 76m for which factory calibration rmsd was lower than the lower bound of the confidence interval for mean rmsd when using depth specific offset calibrations these data points were located near the 1 1 line at the dry end of reference θv but increased in sensor reported θv as reference θv increased since it might not be possible to know beforehand the uniformity in the differences between sensor reported and reference θv the risk of worsening sensor accuracy is unavoidable when applying an offset calibration based on one known data point therefore unless the user has confidence that changes in sensor reported θv are almost identical to changes in true θv the use of an offset calibration cannot yet be recommended further research can investigate optimal sampling timing for offset calibrations and further explore other simplified calibration procedures such as sakaki et al 2011 4 discussion overestimation of θv has been reported in the literature for most of the evaluated sensors cs655 kisekka et al 2014 michel et al 2015 hydraprobe2 ojo et al 2014 2015 5te varble and chávez 2011 ec5 ojo et al 2014 cs616 rüdiger et al 2010 udawatta et al 2011 varble and chávez 2011 mittelbach et al 2012 and field connect rudnick et al 2015 some of these studies commented that the occurrence and or magnitude of overestimation was dependent on θv udawatta et al 2011 mittelbach et al 2012 ojo et al 2014 kisekka et al 2014 rudnick et al 2015 in the present study such dependence on θv could be argued particularly at the 0 76m depth others remarked that overestimation increased with clay content rüdiger et al 2010 varble and chávez 2011 the average clay content of the present study site ranged from 17 to 25 table 1 the differences in results across depths have tended to be associated with soil textural differences in the literature mittelbach et al 2012 showed that cs616 underestimated θv in a clay loam topsoil at the depth of 0 05m but overestimated θv in the underlying loam subsoil at depths of 0 25 0 35 0 55 and 0 80m rudnick et al 2015 noted that overestimation of θv by field connect was greater at 1 00m than at 0 30m and attributed this phenomenon to the higher clay content at the deeper depth in the present study site however soil texture at 0 15 and 0 76m depths was alike table 1 rmsd values of comparable magnitudes for factory calibrations have been published for the evaluated sensors for tdr315 rmsd was 0 0324m3 m 3 in a clay loam repacked in the lab schwartz et al 2016 for hydraprobe2 rmsd was 0 048m3 m 3 in five soils repacked in the lab vaz et al 2013 0 131m3 m 3 in a clay in the field ojo et al 2014 0 018m3 m 3 in a coarse textured soil in the field and 0 052m3 m 3 in a medium textured soil in the field ojo et al 2015 for 5te rmsd was 0 028 0 037m3 m 3 in a sandy clay loam in the field varble and chávez 2011 for ec5 rmsd was 0 058m3 m 3 in clay in the field ojo et al 2014 for cs616 rmsd was 0 144m3 m 3 in five silty soils in the field rüdiger et al 2010 0 15m3 m 3 in three soils repacked in the lab udawatta et al 2011 0 034 0 289m3 m 3 in three soils repacked in the lab varble and chávez 2011 0 192 0 337m3 m 3 in a sandy clay loam in the field varble and chávez 2011 and 0 01 0 14m3 m 3 across seven depths in a medium fine textured soil in the field mittelbach et al 2012 for field connect rmsd was 0 066 0 069m3 m 3 across two depths in a medium fine textured soil in the field rudnick et al 2015 the abundance of previous evaluations on θv measurement accuracy of hydraprobe2 and cs616 generally agree on two points first obtaining rmsd values in excess of 0 05 and 0 10m3 m 3 for these two sensors respectively as did the present study would be ordinary when using factory calibrations rüdiger et al 2010 udawatta et al 2011 varble and chávez 2011 mittelbach et al 2012 ojo et al 2014 2015 second the accuracy of hydraprobe2 and cs616 factory calibrations often deteriorates with increasing clay content as shown by varble and chávez 2011 vaz et al 2013 and ojo et al 2015 but not by udawatta et al 2011 the εr measurements at 50mhz by hydraprobe2 and period measurements around 175mhz by cs616 are both affected by dielectric dispersion seyfried and murdock 2004 kelleners et al 2005 the latter is affected additionally by ec kelleners et al 2005 because both dielectric dispersion and ec are related to clay content and clay mineralogy seyfried and murdock 2004 the relationship between measured εr and true θv for hydraprobe2 and the relationship between measured period and true θv for cs616 may vary among soils in support of the results of our study some field studies have noted that rmsd in θv was smaller when using site specific regression calibrations developed in undisturbed field soil than when using factory calibrations varble and chávez 2011 nolz 2012 ojo et al 2014 2015 rudnick et al 2015 just as the accuracy of factory calibrations has been evaluated with independent data the accuracy of new regression calibrations should be evaluated by cross validation or external validation with sufficiently diverse data to include the full spectrum of conditions under which these new regression calibrations would be applied factors that may differ between calibration conditions and validation conditions would include the observed range of θv the strength of confounding interfering variables e g t and em properties and the magnitude of inter replicate variability in electronics and installation by splitting a time series of aquacheck data into an earlier portion for regression calibration and a later portion for validation rmsd across six depths was 0 005 0 019m3 m 3 during calibration but roughly doubled to 0 009 0 037m3 m 3 nolz 2012 by using a regression calibration based on 12 field connect replicates in the same field during the previous growing season rmsd in θv reported by 18 field connect replicates was reduced to 0 038m3 m 3 from 0 067m3 m 3 as obtained by using the factory calibration rudnick et al 2015 if a new regression calibration performed worse than the factory calibration in such evaluations then the benefit of the former would be in question it may be possible to manage irrigation by monitoring changes in sensor reported θv instead of exact values of sensor reported θv this approach is very similar to the offset calibration because it is based on the same assumption that sensor θv and reference θv have equal sensitivity i e with 1 unit increase in reference θv there is 1 unit increase in sensor θv but on the basis of assessing the scatterplots with 1 1 line comparing sensor θv with reference θv fig 5 we observe that slope of the relationship between sensor θv and reference θv is not consistently one instead many of these relationships are curvilinear indicating that the sensitivity of sensor θv varies with the reference θv therefore we cannot recommend at this time that the offset calibration monitoring changes in θv will always be appropriate for irrigation management we did note that some of the em sensors had slopes closer to one at certain depths further research could be conducted to analyze if the appropriateness of offset calibrations or tracking changes is an inherent property of each em sensor or is site specific or merely coincidental 4 1 implications while the differences between reference and sensor reported θv were sometimes large when using factory calibrations in this study regression calibrations of θv resulted in excellent fit nonetheless for all sensors at individual depths or for combined data this finding would suggest that much of the uncertainty in sensor reported θv for the sensors under evaluation was systematic and could be modeled the dominance of systematic error reported by the investigated sensors highlights that the development of more accurate calibrations is a principal key to improving sensor reported θv increasing the number of sensor replicates would only reduce variance due to random errors such as inter replicate variability inter cycle variability and fluctuations for a calibration to be transferable the sensor must either be highly resistant to potentially confounding factors e g t eca clay mineralogy and content or the calibration must account for these factors internally if the major factors can be identified and quantified and the effects of these factors can be well modeled perhaps sensor calibrations similar to pedo transfer functions for estimating the soil water characteristics curve can be developed an alternative to devising a universal calibration is performing site specific calibrations although conducting comprehensive regression calibrations at each field site might be impractical if a sensor is widely applied however the relative success of offset calibrations for certain sensors in this field study was encouraging and may signal new opportunities how regression and offset calibrations can be conducted practically and accurately for the purpose of irrigation management is yet to be investigated qualitative information about soil water status can be determined from the em sensors installed at different depths since the factory calibrations and the alternate calibrations followed the general trend of reference θv however scheduling irrigation by considering em sensor reported θv as the true θv might be misleading and can result in unintended consequences such as over or under irrigating for irrigation management alternate paradigms of sensor use possibly analyzing trends and relative values at one or more depths rather than relying on conversions from raw output to water content for decision making might also deserve scientific attention all these issues can be further explored in future research 5 conclusions a field study was conducted at the university of nebraska lincoln west

11601,accurate continuous measurements of temperature t apparent electrical conductivity eca apparent dielectric permittivity εra and volumetric water content θv are extremely valuable to irrigation management and other agronomic decisions the performance of eight electromagnetic em sensors tdr315 cs655 hydraprobe2 5te ec5 cs616 field connect aquacheck were analyzed through a field study in a loam soil t eca and εra were compared in reference to overall average among all sensors and θv in reference to a neutron moisture meter nmm the reported t and eca difference among the sensors were within 1 c and 1dsm 1 respectively at 0 15 and 0 76m depths among the single sensor probes the range of depth combined 0 15 and 0 76m rmsd for factory calibration varied from 0 039m3 m 3 5te to 0 157m3 m 3 cs616 in comparison to single sensor probes rmsd of field connect at combined depths 0 30 and 0 51m was moderate 0 083m3 m 3 and rmsd of aquacheck at combined depths 0 30 and 0 61m was high

of the 95 confidence interval for mean rmsd of most sensors were below 0 02 and 0 04m3 m 3 respectively when using depth specific offset calibrations the relative success of offset calibrations for certain sensors in this study is encouraging and may signal new opportunities because much of the uncertainty in sensor reported θv for the sensors under evaluation was systematic future work should aim to develop universal calibrations or facilitate site specific calibrations keywords calibration capacitance electrical conductivity neutron permittivity soil water content 1 introduction accurate determination of soil water quantity and quality can better inform the timing and depth of irrigation applications and reduce the likelihood of excessively or insufficiently irrigating excessive irrigation increases fertilizer and irrigation pumping costs as well as generates additional nitrate leaching and greenhouse gas emissions furthermore by subjecting soil and plant canopies to frequent and prolonged wet conditions excessive irrigation can decrease harvestable yield due to greater occurrence and severity of disease anaerobic soil conditions nutrient deficiencies and inability to operate farm machinery on the opposite extreme inadequate soil water as a result of insufficient irrigation limits transpiration and photosynthesis and in turn hinders crop growth and yield potential doorenbos and kassam 1979 measurements of soil water quantity is arguably the most necessary geophysical estimate for implementing deficit irrigation in which crop water status is carefully managed to maximize grain yield with a limited water supply geerts and raes 2009 although most attention in irrigation scheduling is focused on soil water quantity soil water quality likewise deserves consideration measurements of soil salinity can guide the use of irrigation to leach salts out of the crop root zone to maintain soil salinity levels within a crop s tolerable range u s salinity laboratory and staff 1954 limited irrigation can be applied if rescue fertilizer applications are undesired or infeasible based on the detection of nutrient stressed crops rudnick and irmak 2014 observed a reduction in corn evapotranspiration et when the crops were subjected to nitrogen stress irrigation exceeding a crop s et rate can cause further reduction in nutrient availability through leaching and consequently affect grain yield and the environment repeated nondestructive measurement of soil water status is ideal because temporal trends can be determined without the potentially confounding influence of soil spatial variability neutron moisture meter nmm is the current standard to measure accurate repeated and non destructive field volumetric water content θv chanasyk and naeth 1996 and if calibrated with respect to thermogravimetric method it can be used to compare other soil water monitoring devices leib et al 2003 however the nmm is not typically an option for on farm management or collecting high spatiotemporal dense data due to the radioactive source which requires proper training licensing and safety measures when handling storing and transporting the instrument rudnick et al 2015 since electromagnetic em properties of soil vary with θv various em sensors that can be installed into the soil to provide continuous measurement of soil water quantity have been developed tested and adopted over the last several decades some of these em sensors also measure apparent electrical conductivity eca and temperature t these extra capabilities undoubtedly broaden the applicability of em sensors in both research and production scenarios for example measurement of eca can be used to monitor soil salinity rhoades et al 1976 if calibrated using saturation extract electrical conductivity ece and to monitor nitrate nitrogen no3 n concentrations in soil and water payero et al 2006 temperature is a key environmental variable for plants during the vegetative period as it affects time of emergence schneider and gupta 1985 and grain yield bollero et al 1996 however merely deploying em sensors and amassing a large dataset does not guarantee improvements in research and management predictive models revealing findings and better informed decisions require accuracy in soil water quantity and quality data despite commonalities among em sensors some studies have shown that the distinctions in measurement technology design installation method internal adjustments and factory calibration could culminate in substantial disparities in θv measurement accuracy across sensors varble and chávez 2011 chavez and evett 2012 mittelbach et al 2012 vaz et al 2013 it is imperative that these disparities among sensors are recognized to identify appropriate sensors across regions and applications and develop improved calibrations a field study was conducted to analyze the performance of eight em sensors tdr315 cs655 hydraprobe2 5te ec5 cs616

scarcely been reported in the literature e g cs655 tdr315 aquacheck and field connect kisekka et al 2014 rudnick et al 2015 zeelie 2015 schwartz et al 2016 as well as supplement the body of knowledge

mittelbach et al 2012 across diverse settings results of this field study may be somewhat directly transferable to similar environments useful for meta analyses in understanding sensor performance between divergent environments and laying a foundation for future research the specific objectives of the research were to 1 evaluate factory calibrations of the em sensors for t eca apparent dielectrical permittivity εra and θv and 2 compare the factory calibration for θv against two custom calibration approaches the first a conventional approach based on regression and the second an offset approach based on one known data point 2 material and methods 2 1 site soil and experiment descriptions a field experiment was conducted at the university of nebraska lincoln west central research and extension center wcrec in north platte ne 41 1 n 100 8 w and 861m above sea level during the 2016 growing season the research site is located in a semi arid climate zone with average annual precipitation and standardized alfalfa reference et ewri 2005 of 514 and 1530mm respectively hprcc 2016 ncdc 2015 the research was performed with soybean at 0 76m spacing planted on may 26 2016 during the study period which was 28 july to 5 september 2016 three significant rain events occurred 31mm on 28 july 17mm on 11 august and 9mm on 26 august textural composition organic matter content omc and bulk density ρb were determined at soil depth intervals of 0 15m from 0 08 to 0 84m table 1 a pit was dug between two rows of soybeans single sensor probes were inserted into one of the pit walls so that the prongs were oriented horizontally and located directly underneath a single row of soybeans two replicates of the following sensors 5te ec5 hydraprobe2 cs616 cs655 and tdr315 were installed at a depth of 0 15m and two replicates of the same sensors were installed at a depth of 0 76m at each depth the arrangement of the sensors along the soybean row was randomized and the sensors were 0 15m apart from each other this spacing was chosen so that every sensor was outside the measurement volumes of the other sensors the sensor outputs were recorded every hour in addition two replicates of the field connect and aquacheck probes and four replicates of nmm aluminum access tubes were installed in the crop row neighboring the aforementioned sensors all sensors were installed following manufacturer recommendations and allowed to equilibrate with the surrounding soil prior to the start of the study 2 2 description of sensors 2 2 1 tdr315 the acclima tdr315 acclima inc meridian id is a time domain reflectometer with three parallel rods serving as the waveguide the sensor head has all necessary electronics and firmware to generate an em pulse and construct a waveform to determine the propagation time of the em wave which is used to estimate εra the sensor is equipped with a thermistor to measure soil t tdr315 measures eca based on giese and tiemann method giese and tiemann 1975 like conventional tdr equipment a proprietary dielectric mixing model is used to estimate θv from εra however topp equation eq 1 topp et al 1980 was considered for determination of θv from εra reported by tdr315 as well 1 θv 4 3 10 6 εra 3 5 5 10 4 εra 2 2 92 10 2 εra 5 3 10 2 2 2 2 cs616 and cs655 the campbell scientific cs616 and cs655 campbell scientific inc logan ut are water content reflectometers with two parallel rods forming an open ended transmission line the sensors measure the two way travel time of an em pulse to determine a period average the cs616 uses a quadratic equation relating period average to calculate θv whereas the cs655 uses a factory calibrated empirical model involving voltage ratio and period average to determine εra and then estimates θv from εra using the topp equation eq 1 the cs655 sensor also measures soil t using a thermistor and eca by determining the ratio between the excitation voltage and the measured voltage the manufacturer s t adjustment was also considered for cs616 by using t measurements by cs655 2 2 3 hydraprobe2 the stevens hydraprobe2 stevens water monitoring systems inc portland or is an impedance sensor with three tines surrounding one center tine it measures real εr and imaginary εr dieletric permittivity separately from the response of a reflected standing em wave at a radio frequency of 50mhz the εr is used to estimate θv using a square root mixing model whereas εr is used to estimate eca in addition topp equation eq 1 was considered for determination of θv from εr reported by hydraprobe2 as well this sensor also measures soil t using a thermistor the default θv calibration which is the loam calibration is stated to be suitable for most medium textured soils and therefore was used in this study 2 2 4 5te and ec5 the decagon devices 5te and ec5 decagon devices inc pullman wa are a three and two pronged capacitance sensor respectively and are designed to use an oscillator running at 70mhz frequency to measure εra the 5te sensor estimates θv from εra using the topp equation eq 1 whereas the ec5 sensor uses a linear calibration equation to determine εra and θv from output voltage however topp equation eq 1 was considered for determination of θv from εra reported by ec5 as well the 5te sensor also measures soil t using a thermistor that is in thermal contact with the sensor prongs as well as eca using screws on the surface of the sensor to form a two sensor electrical array 2 2 5 multi sensor capacitance probes the multi sensor capacitance probes used in this study were the john deere field connect deere company moline il and aquacheck classic probe aquacheck ltd durbanville south africa each sensor along the probe shaft emits an em field into the soil the reported count which is proportional to the sensor circuit resonant frequency is used to calculate a scaled frequency the scaled frequency is then converted to θv field connect performs this conversion using a proprietary calibration procedure and each probe has sensors located at depths of 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 5 and 1 0m for aquacheck the conversion was not built in but the manufacturer provided six equations five soil specific and one generic the five texture specific equations were each generated from field calibrations in south africa whereas the generic equation used the pooled data from three soil types sand silt loam and clay zeelie 2015 according to the textural classification of the soil loam calibration was selected for conversion of scaled frequency to θv and generic calibration was selected as well one version of aquacheck probes was included in this study with sensors located at depths of 0 10 0 20 0 30 0 41 0 61 and 0 81m 2 2 6 neutron moisture meter the neutron moisture meter nmm used in this study was a cpn 503dr hydroprobe moisture neutron depth gauge campbell pacific nuclear international inc concord ca a nmm is comprised of a nuclear source and detector the nuclear source is lowered into an access tube at a desired depth 0 15 0 30 0 46 0 76 and 0 91m where high energy neutrons are emitted into the soil and thermalized slowed down by colliding with hydrogen atoms the thermalized low energy neutrons are counted by a helium 3 detector and are compared against a standard count to estimate θv from a linear calibration equation with slope a and intercept b 2 θ v a n e u t r o n c o u n t s t a n d a r d c o u n t b the standard count is used to monitor the performance and verify that the nmm is operating without faults a nmm is not typically sensitive to changes in t and salinity evett et al 2006 however it can be influenced by omc clay content soil texture and chemical elements hauser 1984 and therefore a site specific calibration of a nmm is recommended a site specific calibration of the cpn 503dr nmm was performed for this study ordinary least squares regression was used to fit a linear calibration equation between observed neutron count ratios and thermo gravimetrically determined θv of 21 intact soil samples ranging between 0 104 and 0 302m3 m 3 from the depths 0 15 0 30 0 46 0 61 0 76 and 0 91m the soil samples used for the calibration were collected within 2m of the investigated sensors the resulting calibration root mean squared difference rmsd evaluated with the calibration dataset was 0 007m3 m 3 and the coefficient of determination r2 was 0 99 2 3 analysis in this study temperature t apparent electrical conductivity eca apparent dielectric permittivity εra and volumetric water content θv were analyzed with emphasis on θv determined from all the single sensor and multi sensor probes among the sensors under evaluation tdr315 cs655 hydraprobe2 and 5te reported εra as well as t and eca apart from θv εra was also reported by ec5 t eca and εra reported by each sensor were compared with the average reported values for these parameters among all sensors at depths of 0 15 and 0 76m to investigate the comparability of these parameters amongst different sensors the purpose of such analyses was to determine how closely these parameters t eca and εra were reported by different sensors rather than an accuracy assessment because eca reported by 5te have been automatically normalized to 25 c decagon devices 2016 eca reported by tdr315 cs655 and hydraprobe2 were manually normalized to 25 c for consistency using eq 3 campbell scientific 2016 3 e c a 25 e c a 1 0 02 t 25 where eca 25 dsm 1 is the apparent electrical conductivity after normalization to 25 c eca dsm 1 is the apparent electrical conductivity before normalization to 25 c and t is the soil temperature at time and space of apparent electrical conductivity measurement c average mean deviation amd eq 4 of the sensor reported values of t eca and εra from the corresponding overall average of all em sensors was computed from the data pairs considered in the analysis each data pair consisted of an average sensor reported parameter t eca or εra and overall average among all sensors at a certain time amd was calculated as 4 a m d i n s i m i n where i is the index of the data pairs n is the number of data pairs si is the sensor reported value of the ith data pair and mi is the mean of all sensors of the ith data pair the field calibrated nmm was used as the reference for θv following bell et al 1987 leib et al 2003 and rudnick et al 2015 on each of 14 dates during the study period a 16 s nmm reading was collected at each of five depths 0 15 0 30 0 51 0 61 and 0 76m in each of four access tubes the reference value of θv at a given depth on a given date was obtained by averaging the four readings one from each tube at that depth on that date besides the default factory calibrations for the em sensors alternate calibrations were explored for some of the sensors the topp equation eq 1 was considered for tdr315 hydraprobe2 and ec5 sensor reported and reference θv values for each sensor were compared at two depths 0 15 and 0 76m for single sensor probes 0 30 and 0 51m for field connect 0 30 and 0 61m for aquacheck separately and combined the sensor reported θv recorded at the time closest to each nmm reading always within one hour was considered and the pair of sensor reported θv and reference θv formed a set of comparison for the analysis several statistics were calculated to summarize each set of comparisons the mean difference md eq 5 and standard deviation of difference sdd eq 6 of the sensor reported values from corresponding reference values were calculated the equations for calculating md eq 5 and amd eq 4 are similar however md compares sensor reported θv against the reference nmm average θv whereas amd compares sensor reported parameter t eca or εra against the overall average parameter t eca or εra among all sensors the root mean squared difference rmsd on the other hand was the commonly computed indicator of the absolute magnitude of the differences between sensor reported and reference values while penalizing larger differences eq 7 5 m d i n s i r i n 6 s d d i n s i r i m d 2 n 1 7 r m s d i n s i r i 2 n where i is the index of the data pairs n is the number of data pairs si is the sensor reported value of the ith data pair and ri is the reference value of the ith data pair for θv two types of custom calibrations were developed to compare with the factory calibration the first type was regression calibration of sensor reported values to reference values a linear model and a quadratic model were considered in every case to obtain a more conservative rmsd value for comparison with the factory calibration the rmsd of each model was calculated using the leave one out cross validation loocv approach instead of comparing each reference value against the model fitted using all data pairs in loocv rmsd calculations each reference value was compared against the model fitted using all data pairs except the pair to which the particular reference value belonged the model with the smaller loocv rmsd was selected loocv rmsd was reported with the best fit coefficient estimates of the selected model according to ordinary least squares with all data pairs included calculations were conducted in statistical computing language r r version 3 3 2 r foundation for statistical computing wein austria the second type of custom calibration for θv was offset calibration based on one known data pair this type of calibration would be performed by making one highly accurate e g thermo gravimetric or nmm θv measurement to determine a constant offset with which to shift all other sensor reported θv values as a simulation an offset was calculated as the difference of the sensor reported value from the corresponding reference value of one data pair and that offset was subtracted from the sensor reported values of all other data pairs the rmsd between the shifted sensor reported values and the reference values of those data pairs was calculated and the process was repeated until every data pair had been used to calculate the offset exactly once with the number of rmsd values equal to the number of data pairs a 95 confidence interval of the mean rmsd based on the student s t distribution was computed using the t test function in statistical computing language r 3 results 3 1 temperature weather and time of day caused daily soil t fluctuations with large amplitudes at the shallower depth 0 15m but were dampened and integrated into roughly weekly fluctuations with small amplitudes at the deeper soil depth 0 76m fig 1 each em sensor average was compared against the average of all em sensors the comparisons above would suggest that two of the same or different em sensors could be expected to report t values generally within 1 c of each other when subjected to the same environmental conditions therefore the investigated sensors would be able to differentiate for example soil t between coulter planting and conventional planting which has been reported to have a mean difference as low as 2 2 c griffith et al 1973 such comparability among sensors provides confidence that the sensors can be used for crop modeling and planting decisions 3 2 apparent electrical conductivity eca in general all sensors had a decreasing trend in eca over time and appeared to follow the wetting and drying cycle of the soil it was observed that following a wetting event precipitation of 17mm on 11 august there was an increase in eca fig 2 the 0 15m soil depth responded more to wetting events as compared to the 0 76m soil depth a comparison for each em sensor average eca against the average eca of all em sensors was made the range for reported eca among all sensors at both depths was within 1dsm 1 within the observed range of eca for the em sensors hydraprobe2 and cs655 reported eca were comparable to the overall average at both depths seyfried and murdock 2004 compared eca measurements by hydraprobe and by a conductivity electrode calibrated with standard solutions they found that the two sensors reported similar eca values in kcl solutions between 0 1 5dsm 1 but there was an accuracy deterioration with increasing solution eca and concentration logdson et al 2010 reported that measured ec by hydraprobe was very similar to theoretical ec for fluids and suggested that an adjustment was needed in the hydraprobe reported eca to account for dielectric relaxation in soils at 0 76m depth where the eca reported by other sensors was within the range 0 16 0 92dsm 1 the two 5te replicates were essentially nonresponsive and only reported eca between 0 00 and 0 03dsm 1 the contrasting performance of 5te sensors at both depths relative to other sensors was unlikely due to defective sensors because the differences were consistent across replicates and depths chavez and evett 2012 reported an underestimation of eca for 5te sensor by about 35 in comparison to conventional tdr however schwartz et al 2013 witnessed that eca reported by 5te sensor was very similar to eca reported by conventional tdr 3 3 apparent dielectric permittivity εra similar to the temporal trends in eca all sensors had a decreasing trend in εra over time and followed the wetting and drying cycle of the soil where εra increased following a wetting event fig 3 as expected the 0 15m soil depth responded more to wetting events as compared to the 0 76m soil depth since the near surface soil is subjected to more transient water dynamics as compared with lower soil depths according to rudnick and irmak 2014 cross comparison amongst εra reported by different em sensors was made with the average εra of all em sensors the amd within reported εra spanned across a wide range at shallower depth 6 01 12 84 and a narrow range at deeper depth 3 08 6 72 comparatively with the observed range of εra within 10 50 40 99 at 0 15m and 6 56 28 55 at 0 76m depth table 2 the hydraprobe2 sensor recorded the largest average εra difference with respect to the overall average the difference was consistent for both the replications in comparison to the overall average at two depths this remarkable difference in εra was possibly due to differences in operating measurement frequency amongst sensors seyfried and murdock 2004 synthesized the findings of multiple researchers on the differences between soil permittivity measured at around 1ghz typical for tdr and at 50mhz default for hydraprobe2 they claimed that the real εr and imaginary εr dieletric permittivity and consequently εra of soils except sands were often larger at 50mhz than at around 1ghz if this interpretation holds true it would not be appropriate to directly compare εra reported by sensors with different measurement frequencies 3 4 volumetric water content θv 3 4 1 temporal trends the study period could be characterized as a drying cycle that began with a 31mm rain on 28 july and was interrupted by a 17mm rain on 11 august and a 9mm rain on 26 august reference θv which was the average nmm θv from four access tubes ranged from 0 180 0 332m3 m 3 at 0 15m 0 173 0 260m3 m 3 at 0 30m 0 139 0 189m3 m 3 at 0 51m 0 130 0 192m3 m 3 at 0 61m and 0 131 0 214m3 m 3 at 0 76m with increasing depth the range of reference θv narrowed because deeper depths received less of infiltrated rainfall and contributed less to et as compared to shallower depths the differences between sensor reported and reference θv varied among sensors and over time fig 4 however for all evaluated sensors the factory calibrations and the considered alternate calibrations followed the general trend of reference θv all evaluated sensors nonetheless commonly overestimated θv relative to the reference using the topp equation eq 1 instead of the factory calibration improved the performance of tdr315 but not hydraprobe2 or the ec5 by switching to topp equation combined rmsd for tdr315 decreased by 0 013m3 m 3 whereas combined rmsd for hydraprobe and ec5 increased by 0 029 and 0 100m3 m 3 respectively the topp equation was developed using tdr topp et al 1980 and has been demonstrated to be applicable in many soils dane and topp 2002 thus the suitability of the topp equation for tdr315 was not surprising the likely overestimation of εra by hydraprobe2 is discussed in the previous subsection therefore applying the topp equation to εra based on hydraprobe2 measurements would tend to inflate the calculated θv matching the observations in the present study in fact overestimation of θv also occurred when vaz et al 2013 applied the topp equation to εr as measured by hydraprobe2 the influence of ambient t on cs616 has been described in the literature udawatta et al 2011 varble and chávez 2011 mittelbach et al 2012 in the present study cs616 reported θv at 0 15m using the factory calibration exhibited diurnal fluctuations in which θv appeared to decrease with decreasing soil t and increase with increasing soil t or and wraith 1999 attributed these diurnal fluctuations not to actual changes in θv but to both the volume fraction of bound water and the t effects on the permittivity of bulk water besides altering the em properties of the surrounding media t could also affect sensor electronics seyfried and grant 2007 the manufacturer s t adjustment however arguably did not improve the accuracy of cs616 reported θv in the present study when this adjustment was applied to the cs616 data at 0 15m the diurnal fluctuations was simultaneously reversed and amplified such an outcome may indicate overcompensation by the manufacturer s t adjustment which rüdiger et al 2010 noticed while the soil at the field site was a loam aquacheck reported θv was further from reference θv when using the loam calibration than when using the generic calibration loam was intermediate among the five soil textural classes for which a specific calibration was provided by the manufacturer yet the loam calibration was most unlike the other calibrations because the former computed a much higher θv when the same scaled frequency was measured as compared to the sites where the other calibrations were developed the site where the loam calibration was developed might have differed in one or more non textural soil properties that heavily impacted aquacheck response 3 4 2 factory calibration commonalities in performance statistics were found among the evaluated sensors table 3 md was positive for all evaluated sensors at all depths a result in agreement with the earlier finding that sensor reported θv was predominantly higher than reference θv except in the cases of cs655 and ec5 sdd never exceeded half of md at any depth or for combined data signifying that the deviations of sensor reported θv from reference θv for each of the other six sensors were rather consistent in direction and magnitude consequently rmsd mostly followed the patterns of md the performance statistics varied among depths md was smaller at the shallower depth and larger at the deeper depth for five sensors tdr315 5te ec5 field connect and aquacheck while the opposite was true for three sensors cs655 hydraprobe2 and cs616 except in the cases of tdr315 and ec5 sdd was similar at individual depths but larger for the combined data with rmsd ranging between 0 032 and 0 197m3 m 3 at individual depths and between 0 039 and 0 163m3 m 3 for combined data the evaluated sensors ranged between fair 0 05m3 m 3 rmsd 0 01m3 m 3 and very poor rmsd 0 1m3 m 3 on the accuracy scale of fares et al 2011 on the same scale the performance of field connect was poor 0 1m3 m 3 rmsd 0 05m3 m 3 and aquacheck was very poor rmsd 0 1m3 m 3 for combined data with the rmsd values of field connect and aquacheck as 0 083 and 0 163m3 m 3 respectively among the single sensor probes rmsd of 5te was smallest both at 0 15m and for combined data with values of 0 035 and 0 039m3 m 3 respectively whereas rmsd of cs655 was the smallest at 0 76m with a value of 0 032m3 m 3 rmsd of cs616 was the largest among the single sensor probes at both depths and combined 3 4 3 regression calibration out of the 24 regression calibration equations 5 were linear and 19 were quadratic fig 5 here polynomial order was selected by minimization of loocv rmsd and not by statistical significance tests with α 0 05 if the latter method was applied the regression calibration equations for cs616 at 0 76m and for field connect at 0 30m would be linear because the p value for the true quadratic coefficient being zero was 0 10 and 0 14 respectively for these two datasets interestingly the estimate of the intercept was greater than zero for all regression calibration equations in all linear calibration equations reference θv m sensor θv c the estimate of the linear coefficient m was positive but less than 1 hence the sensors to which these linear calibration equations were fitted were more sensitive than the reference the quadratic calibration equations on the other hand implied that sensitivity generally increased with θv within the observed θv range some of the regression calibration equations for θv were negatively sensitive under dry conditions and or highly sensitive under wet conditions at the minimum sensor value observed eight regression calibrations specify that increases in sensor reported θv would signify decreases in reference θv these calibrations are those for cs655 hydraprobe2 5te and ec5 at 0 15m field connect at 0 30m and for combined data and aquacheck at 0 61m and for combined data at the maximum sensor value observed six regression calibrations specify that one unit of increase in sensor reported θv would signify more than two units of increase in reference θv these calibrations are those for tdr315 5te and ec5 at 0 15m field connect for combined data and aquacheck at 0 30m and for combined data additional caution is therefore recommended when applying these equations with negative or high sensitivity regression calibrations led to substantial improvement in θv accuracy beyond factory calibration table 4 for example rmsd of cs616 exceeded by 0 10m3 m 3 at both depths when using factory calibration yet when using regression calibration rmsd of cs616 dropped below 0 02m3 m 3 for depth specific and combined data in general rmsd of the evaluated sensors were below 0 015m3 m 3 using depth specific regression calibrations and below 0 020m3 m 3 using combined regression calibrations the exceptions were cs655 at 0 15m and combined ec5 at 0 15m and combined and field connect at both depths and combined in these cases the two replicates of the same sensor tended to report noticeably different θv values at the same depth among all considered regression calibrations the combined regression calibration of field connect resulted in the largest rmsd of 0 026m3 m 3 3 4 4 offset calibration though the improvements in θv accuracy gained by using offset calibrations were smaller and less consistent than the improvements gained by using regression calibrations offset calibrations were nonetheless valuable for several sensors under evaluation table 4 for example rmsd of hydraprobe2 exceeded 0 10m3 m 3 at 0 15m and for combined data when using factory calibration using offset calibrations the upper bound of the confidence interval for mean rmsd of hydraprobe2 was below 0 03m3 m 3 at 0 15m and below 0 06m3 m 3 for combined data the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval for mean rmsd of most sensors were below 0 02 and 0 04m3 m 3 respectively when using depth specific offset calibrations for cs655 hydraprobe2 cs616 field connect and aquacheck using combined offset calibrations tended to result in higher rmsd than using depth specific offset calibrations the highest confidence interval for mean rmsd among all offset calibrations was 0 072 0 082m3 m 3 for cs655 with combined data an offset calibration determined the difference between sensor reported θv and reference θv for one data point and then shifted all other data points by that difference offset calibrations were therefore most beneficial if data points fitted tightly around one line whose slope was around 1 for example the distribution of all 5te data points generally matched one line with a slope of 1 so rmsd of both depth specific and combined offset calibrations were relatively low as for cs616 the distribution of 0 15m data points generally matched one line with a slope of 1 and the distribution of 0 76m data points generally matched a different line with slope of 1 the ultimate result was low rmsd for depth specific offset calibrations but high rmsd for combined offset calibrations offset calibrations could also be worse than factory calibrations if the differences from reference θv values were extremely variable among sensor reported θv values one instance was cs655 data points at 0 76m for which factory calibration rmsd was lower than the lower bound of the confidence interval for mean rmsd when using depth specific offset calibrations these data points were located near the 1 1 line at the dry end of reference θv but increased in sensor reported θv as reference θv increased since it might not be possible to know beforehand the uniformity in the differences between sensor reported and reference θv the risk of worsening sensor accuracy is unavoidable when applying an offset calibration based on one known data point therefore unless the user has confidence that changes in sensor reported θv are almost identical to changes in true θv the use of an offset calibration cannot yet be recommended further research can investigate optimal sampling timing for offset calibrations and further explore other simplified calibration procedures such as sakaki et al 2011 4 discussion overestimation of θv has been reported in the literature for most of the evaluated sensors cs655 kisekka et al 2014 michel et al 2015 hydraprobe2 ojo et al 2014 2015 5te varble and chávez 2011 ec5 ojo et al 2014 cs616 rüdiger et al 2010 udawatta et al 2011 varble and chávez 2011 mittelbach et al 2012 and field connect rudnick et al 2015 some of these studies commented that the occurrence and or magnitude of overestimation was dependent on θv udawatta et al 2011 mittelbach et al 2012 ojo et al 2014 kisekka et al 2014 rudnick et al 2015 in the present study such dependence on θv could be argued particularly at the 0 76m depth others remarked that overestimation increased with clay content rüdiger et al 2010 varble and chávez 2011 the average clay content of the present study site ranged from 17 to 25 table 1 the differences in results across depths have tended to be associated with soil textural differences in the literature mittelbach et al 2012 showed that cs616 underestimated θv in a clay loam topsoil at the depth of 0 05m but overestimated θv in the underlying loam subsoil at depths of 0 25 0 35 0 55 and 0 80m rudnick et al 2015 noted that overestimation of θv by field connect was greater at 1 00m than at 0 30m and attributed this phenomenon to the higher clay content at the deeper depth in the present study site however soil texture at 0 15 and 0 76m depths was alike table 1 rmsd values of comparable magnitudes for factory calibrations have been published for the evaluated sensors for tdr315 rmsd was 0 0324m3 m 3 in a clay loam repacked in the lab schwartz et al 2016 for hydraprobe2 rmsd was 0 048m3 m 3 in five soils repacked in the lab vaz et al 2013 0 131m3 m 3 in a clay in the field ojo et al 2014 0 018m3 m 3 in a coarse textured soil in the field and 0 052m3 m 3 in a medium textured soil in the field ojo et al 2015 for 5te rmsd was 0 028 0 037m3 m 3 in a sandy clay loam in the field varble and chávez 2011 for ec5 rmsd was 0 058m3 m 3 in clay in the field ojo et al 2014 for cs616 rmsd was 0 144m3 m 3 in five silty soils in the field rüdiger et al 2010 0 15m3 m 3 in three soils repacked in the lab udawatta et al 2011 0 034 0 289m3 m 3 in three soils repacked in the lab varble and chávez 2011 0 192 0 337m3 m 3 in a sandy clay loam in the field varble and chávez 2011 and 0 01 0 14m3 m 3 across seven depths in a medium fine textured soil in the field mittelbach et al 2012 for field connect rmsd was 0 066 0 069m3 m 3 across two depths in a medium fine textured soil in the field rudnick et al 2015 the abundance of previous evaluations on θv measurement accuracy of hydraprobe2 and cs616 generally agree on two points first obtaining rmsd values in excess of 0 05 and 0 10m3 m 3 for these two sensors respectively as did the present study would be ordinary when using factory calibrations rüdiger et al 2010 udawatta et al 2011 varble and chávez 2011 mittelbach et al 2012 ojo et al 2014 2015 second the accuracy of hydraprobe2 and cs616 factory calibrations often deteriorates with increasing clay content as shown by varble and chávez 2011 vaz et al 2013 and ojo et al 2015 but not by udawatta et al 2011 the εr measurements at 50mhz by hydraprobe2 and period measurements around 175mhz by cs616 are both affected by dielectric dispersion seyfried and murdock 2004 kelleners et al 2005 the latter is affected additionally by ec kelleners et al 2005 because both dielectric dispersion and ec are related to clay content and clay mineralogy seyfried and murdock 2004 the relationship between measured εr and true θv for hydraprobe2 and the relationship between measured period and true θv for cs616 may vary among soils in support of the results of our study some field studies have noted that rmsd in θv was smaller when using site specific regression calibrations developed in undisturbed field soil than when using factory calibrations varble and chávez 2011 nolz 2012 ojo et al 2014 2015 rudnick et al 2015 just as the accuracy of factory calibrations has been evaluated with independent data the accuracy of new regression calibrations should be evaluated by cross validation or external validation with sufficiently diverse data to include the full spectrum of conditions under which these new regression calibrations would be applied factors that may differ between calibration conditions and validation conditions would include the observed range of θv the strength of confounding interfering variables e g t and em properties and the magnitude of inter replicate variability in electronics and installation by splitting a time series of aquacheck data into an earlier portion for regression calibration and a later portion for validation rmsd across six depths was 0 005 0 019m3 m 3 during calibration but roughly doubled to 0 009 0 037m3 m 3 nolz 2012 by using a regression calibration based on 12 field connect replicates in the same field during the previous growing season rmsd in θv reported by 18 field connect replicates was reduced to 0 038m3 m 3 from 0 067m3 m 3 as obtained by using the factory calibration rudnick et al 2015 if a new regression calibration performed worse than the factory calibration in such evaluations then the benefit of the former would be in question it may be possible to manage irrigation by monitoring changes in sensor reported θv instead of exact values of sensor reported θv this approach is very similar to the offset calibration because it is based on the same assumption that sensor θv and reference θv have equal sensitivity i e with 1 unit increase in reference θv there is 1 unit increase in sensor θv but on the basis of assessing the scatterplots with 1 1 line comparing sensor θv with reference θv fig 5 we observe that slope of the relationship between sensor θv and reference θv is not consistently one instead many of these relationships are curvilinear indicating that the sensitivity of sensor θv varies with the reference θv therefore we cannot recommend at this time that the offset calibration monitoring changes in θv will always be appropriate for irrigation management we did note that some of the em sensors had slopes closer to one at certain depths further research could be conducted to analyze if the appropriateness of offset calibrations or tracking changes is an inherent property of each em sensor or is site specific or merely coincidental 4 1 implications while the differences between reference and sensor reported θv were sometimes large when using factory calibrations in this study regression calibrations of θv resulted in excellent fit nonetheless for all sensors at individual depths or for combined data this finding would suggest that much of the uncertainty in sensor reported θv for the sensors under evaluation was systematic and could be modeled the dominance of systematic error reported by the investigated sensors highlights that the development of more accurate calibrations is a principal key to improving sensor reported θv increasing the number of sensor replicates would only reduce variance due to random errors such as inter replicate variability inter cycle variability and fluctuations for a calibration to be transferable the sensor must either be highly resistant to potentially confounding factors e g t eca clay mineralogy and content or the calibration must account for these factors internally if the major factors can be identified and quantified and the effects of these factors can be well modeled perhaps sensor calibrations similar to pedo transfer functions for estimating the soil water characteristics curve can be developed an alternative to devising a universal calibration is performing site specific calibrations although conducting comprehensive regression calibrations at each field site might be impractical if a sensor is widely applied however the relative success of offset calibrations for certain sensors in this field study was encouraging and may signal new opportunities how regression and offset calibrations can be conducted practically and accurately for the purpose of irrigation management is yet to be investigated qualitative information about soil water status can be determined from the em sensors installed at different depths since the factory calibrations and the alternate calibrations followed the general trend of reference θv however scheduling irrigation by considering em sensor reported θv as the true θv might be misleading and can result in unintended consequences such as over or under irrigating for irrigation management alternate paradigms of sensor use possibly analyzing trends and relative values at one or more depths rather than relying on conversions from raw output to water content for decision making might also deserve scientific attention all these issues can be further explored in future research 5 conclusions a field study was conducted at the university of nebraska lincoln west central research and extension center in north platte ne to evaluate the performance of eight em soil water sensors tdr315 cs655 hydraprobe2 5te ec5 cs616 field connect and aquacheck in a loam soil at two depths all t measuring sensors followed the temporal trends in t generally within 1 c of each other at both depths similarly the reported eca among all sensors at both depths was within 1dsm 1 of each other such comparability among sensors provides confidence that the sensors can be used to provide t data for crop modeling and planting decisions θv determined by the eight em sensors with factory regression and offset calibrations was compared against θv determined by the field calibrated nmm among the single sensor probes the range of depth combined 0 15 and 0 76m rmsd for factory calibration varied from 0 039m3 m 3 5te to 0 157m3 m 3 cs616 in comparison to single sensor probes rmsd of field connect at combined depths 0 30 and 0 51m was moderate 0 083m3 m 3 and rmsd of aquacheck at combined depths 0 30 and 0 61m was high 0 163m3 m 3 using regression calibrations improved θv accuracy beyond factory calibration rmsd of the evaluated sensors were below 0 026m3 m 3 using regression calibrationsfor combined depths the betterment in θv accuracy gained by using offset calibrations was smaller and less consistent than the improvements gained by using regression calibrations the relative success of offset calibrations for certain sensors in this field study is encouraging and may signal new opportunities in addition alternate models of sensor use possibly analyzing trends and relative values at one or more depths rather than relying on conversions from raw output to water content for decision making for irrigation management can be further explored in

cotton under film mulched drip irrigation in salt affected soil the objectives of this study were to test aquacrop performance and to determine the appropriate irrigation amounts for cotton under several scenarios of initial soil water content swc and soil salinity for two typical soils in a saline region of southern xinjiang of china with film mulched drip irrigation a four year irrigation

the root zone and aboveground biomass fitted well with the field observations with coefficient of determination r 2 0 77 and the index of agreement d 0 92 and slightly underestimated yield as for soil salinity the model gave a reliable simulation for less than 80 of full irrigation treatments while underestimated for over 80 of full irrigation treatments overall aquacrop can be used as a feasible tool to predict cotton growth response to water under film mulched drip irrigation in this region according to the principle of high yield and wue the simulation results showed that the appropriate irrigation amounts were recommended at 358 457mm for silty loam and 406 462mm for sandy loam in this region which can provide a reference for irrigation optimization under film mulched drip irrigation

irrigation applying crop simulation models such as cropwat smith 1992 dssat jones et al 2003 wofost van diepen et al 1989 and cropsyst stöckle et al 2003 can be helpful to simulate crop growth under various conditions for optimizing irrigation most of these models however require a large number of input parameters and advanced modeling skills for their calibration and simulation heng et al 2009 among these models aquacrop a water driven model for simulating crop water productivity developed by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations can be applied widely in space and time by normalizing a water productivity parameter for climate both evaporative demand and atmospheric co2 concentration hsiao et al 2009 steduto et al 2009 this model has fewer input parameters than other crop simulation models e g dssat and wofost previous studies have indicated that aquacrop can perform well in predictions of crop growth and productivity and can be applied to optimize irrigation strategies farahani et al 2009 have firstly parameterized and tested aquacrop on cotton with experimental data of three growing seasons collected in north syria under full and deficit irrigation levels with drip irrigation their results showed that the model gave an accurate prediction of evapotranspiration et garcía vila et al 2009 found that aquacrop could adequately estimate the cotton yield response to applied irrigation water they then obtained optimum applied irrigation using an economic optimization procedure wang et al 2013 noted that aquacrop provided a reliable performance on the biomass and yield of winter wheat growth under full and deficit conditions using five year experiment data and determined a minimum irrigation amount to achieve high wue for different hydrologic years kumar et al 2014 evaluated aquacrop performance for four wheat varieties under saline water irrigation in northern india and reported that the model could be used to predict the wheat yield with acceptable accuracy under different saline water irrigations voloudakis et al 2015 in seven areas of greece verified a good performance of aquacrop for cotton yield prediction using three year experiment data and obtained cotton yield response to climate change for these reasons aquacrop may be a suitable tool for crop productivity predictions under various conditions cotton is one of important cash crops in southern xinjiang of china where has favorable heat and sunlight conditions most cotton fields are irrigated using the pattern of film mulched drip irrigation in the case of cotton the performance of aquacrop has not been evaluated under film mulched drip irrigation in southern xinjiang especially for saline soil in this region where crop yields are often restricted by limited water resources and soil salinity the main purposes of this study were to test the performance of aquacrop for cotton growth under film mulched drip irrigation using four year field experiment data and to find the appropriate irrigation amount under different scenarios of initial soil water content swc and soil salinity in two typical soils of southern xinjiang 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description the experimental site was located at the bazhou irrigation experimental station 41 35 n 86 09 e 901m a s l in the suburbs of korla in southern xinjiang an autonomous region in northwestern china the area has a continental desert climate with an annual precipitation and maximum potential evaporation 20 cm diameter evaporation pan of approximate 58 and 2788 2mm respectively the long term seasonal april to october reference evapotranspiration eto and rainfall are 950 and 47mm respectively the average maximum and minimum temperatures during the growing season for cotton are 29 1 and 15 8 c respectively the predominant soil textures at this site are silty loam 41 4 sand 54 4 silt and 4 2 clay and sandy loam 50 2 sand 46 0 silt and 3 8 clay based on the soil taxonomy of the united states department of agriculture the average bulk density in the 1 m soil profile is 1 56gcm 3 the saturated swc θs field capacity fc permanent wilting point pwp and saturated hydraulic conductivity ks at the site are listed in table 1 the soil salt content in the field varies from 3 24 to 13 5gkg 1 from slightly to moderately saline the average depth of groundwater was about 2 6m in 2012 and 2013 since the groundwater was overused its average depth declined to 6 0m in 2015 and 2016 2 2 experimental setup the irrigation experiment was conducted in 2012 2013 2015 and 2016 growing seasons no experiment was arranged in 2014 season due to a low emergence rate caused by cold weather and strong wind the irrigation water was derived from groundwater with a salinity of 3 1dsm 1 the conventional irrigation amount in this region was 525mm based on annual water requirement for cotton we used the conventional irrigation as full irrigation the irrigation treatments during the four growing seasons were set in proportion relative to the full irrigation irel and the detailed information are listed in table 2 i as for 2012 season only four deficit irrigation treatments 525mm t1 t4 were arranged i e approximate 80 70 65 and 55 of full irrigation ii as for 2013 season five irrigation treatments t5 t9 were set covering full and deficit irrigation i e approximate 100 90 85 80 and 70 of full irrigation iii as for 2015 season five irrigation treatments t10 t14 were tested covering over 525mm full and deficit irrigation i e approximate 145 115 100 85 and 55 of full irrigation iv as for 2016 season five irrigation treatments t15 t19 were conducted covering full and deficit irrigation i e approximate 100 90 70 65 and 55 of full irrigation as for 2012 season because the full irrigation was not set the irrigation frequency followed with the local practice and the water amount per irrigation event for t2 t4 was proportionally reduced relative to that for t1 in the over and deficit irrigation treatments during 2013 2015 and 2016 seasons irrigation occurred on the same day as the fully irrigated plots but the duration of irrigation application was increased or reduced to the irel of full irrigation the detailed irrigation schedules for all treatments during the four growing seasons are displayed in fig 1 the irrigation mainly concentrated at squaring flowering and early boll stages 55 115 das it began in mid or late june and ended in late august in the four experimental years table 2 the field was irrigated 11 12 15 and 13 times in 2012 2013 2015 and 2016 growing seasons respectively the difference in the irrigation times among the four seasons was attributed to the irregular rainfall distribution during the four growing seasons the irrigation amount for each treatment was recorded by a flow meter these irrigation treatments were arranged in a randomized complete block design with two replicate plots of 7 7m adjacent plots were separated by 1m to eliminate the effect of the lateral movement of soil water following the local practice the field was drip irrigated with film mulch and the drip lines were arranged with a pattern of one film two drip lines and four rows i e four rows of cotton were irrigated using two drip lines with emitter intervals of 30cm and covered by one strip of white plastic mulch 110cm wide fig 2 the drip tape had an inside diameter of 16mm and an emitter discharge rate of 2 0lh 1 the width of the strip of bare soil between mulches was 30cm 2 3 agronomic practices cotton gossypium hirsutum l was sown after plowing on 1 may 2012 26 april 2013 22 april 2015 and 20 april 2016 at a density of 22 seeds m 2 table 2 the field was flooded in mid april each year two weeks before sowing to provide sufficient water and to leach salt from the soil for cotton emergence and seedling growth the total amount of flood irrigation was about 300mm for each year and the water was derived from the kongque river with a salinity of 0 8dsm 1 inorganic fertilizers 225kgha 1 urea with 46 4 n 375kgha 1 diammonium phosphate with 46 p2o5 and 18 n and 300kgha 1 potassium sulfate with 45 k2o were applied before sowing following local agronomic practices at squaring and flowering stages 600kgha 1 urea 98kgha 1 diammonium phosphate and 88kgha 1 potassium sulfate were applied herbicides were used before planting pesticides were applied every 5 7days from seedling to boll stages with a sprayer pump and the plants were manually topped at the end of july 2 4 data collection and calculations 2 4 1 meteorological data meteorological data for rainfall solar radiation maximum and minimum air temperatures relative humidity and wind speed at a height of 2m were collected hourly by a davis wireless vantage pro2 weather station davis instruments hayward usa installed about 30m away from the experimental field the daily eto calculated using the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 for 2012 2013 2015 and 2016 seasons are shown in fig 3 eto did not differ significantly during the four growing seasons in 2012 and 2013 seasons the rainfall mainly distributed at 40 100days after sowing das as for 2016 season two heavy rainfalls 33 3 and 42 9mm were recorded at 80 and 126 das as for 2015 season the rainfall was much lower than that in the other three seasons thus more irrigation water was required for cotton growth in 2015 2 4 2 measurement of soil water content swc and soil salinity soil samples were collected by using an auger with 5 cm diameter for measuring swc and soil salinity at 20 cm intervals from 0 to 80cm depth in the middles of the wide narrow and bare strips for calculating the average swc and soil salinity in the root zone over the four seasons the samples were collected at sowing the main growth stages seedling squaring and early and late boll stages one day before irrigation every 10 30days and harvest swc and soil salinity were additionally measured at the flowering stage in 2016 season all auger holes were refilled with soil to minimize the experimental error after each sampling the samples were weighed dried in a fan assisted oven at 105 2 c for 24h and reweighed to determine the gravimetric swc volumetric swc was calculated by multiplying gravimetric swc with average bulk density the dried samples were ground and sieved 2mm and the electrical conductivity for each sample was measured in a 1 5 soil water extract ec1 5 at 25 c using a dds 307a conductivity meter shanghai precision scientific instrument inc shanghai china the electrical conductivity of saturation extract ece was estimated using measured ec1 5 based on an empirical expression reported by slavich and petterson 1993 1 ece 2 46 3 03 θ sp ec1 5 n 344 r 2 0 993 where θsp is the gravimetric water content of saturated paste gg 1 at our experimental site the values of θsp were 0 27 and 0 23gg 1 for silty loam and sandy loam respectively 2 4 3 cotton growth measurements sowing date and das to emergence squaring flowering senescence and maturity were recorded in all four years six plants in each plot were randomly selected to monitor the maximum length and width of all green leaves every 10 15days during the growing season the leaf area was calculated by maximum leaf length width of one side of each leaf multiplied by a factor of 0 703 ran et al 2017 zhang et al 2008 which was derived from the linear regression r 2 0 943 n 38 of the calculated and measured leaf area the measured leaf area was determined by using an am 300 leaf area meter adc bioscientific ltd uk leaf area index lai was calculated by multiplying the total green leaf area per plant with actual plant density the canopy cover cc was estimated using lai based on the empirical equation reported by garcía vila et al 2009 2 cc 1 exp lai 1 3 1 exp lai 1 3 three plants from each plot were collected cut and then oven dried at 70 c to constant weights ertek and kanber 2001 yazar et al 2002 to determine the aboveground biomass at intervals of 10 30days cotton yield seeds and lint for each plot was measured at harvest by hand harvesting in an area of 6 67m2 with three replications for 2012 season crop data were less regorous than that for the other three seasons with no aboveground biomass data but detailed soil cc and yield data were available 2 5 model calibration and validation the underlying principles and main algorithms in aquacrop have been described by steduto et al 2009 and raes et al 2009 2012 in case of cotton the recommended values for the cotton parameters were provided in aquacrop manual reported by raes et al 2012 some of these parameters are not universal and need be adjusted to local conditions and the studied cultivars thus calibration and validation of the model should be necessary to evaluate the model feasibility under our experimental condition due to no aboveground biomass data in 2012 season the model was calibrated with measured data of the five irrigation treatments in 2016 season t15 t19 including full and deficit irrigation treatments and complete soil and crop data the percentage of soil cover by film mulch was set at 80 the phenological development of the cotton was obtained at our site using the averages of the four growing seasons 9 das for emergence 55 das for flowering 74 das for maximum root depth 82 das for maximum canopy 118 das for senescence and 160 das for maturity the durations of the flowering and yield formation periods were fixed at 30 and 63days respectively the input data for initial swc and soil salinity were the field measurements at sowing the other crop parameters were fine tuned based on the recommended parameters for cotton in aquacrop manual reporeted by raes et al 2012 the calibrations were run in day mode first fitting the performance of the full irrigation treatment t17 for cc and aboveground biomass and then testing soil water storage sws soil salinity and yield the crop parameters determined with t17 were repeatedly modified until the simulated and observed values sws soil salinity cc aboveground biomass and yield agreed acceptably well for all five treatments in 2016 after calibration the model was validated using the measured data sets from 2012 2013 and 2015 seasons the outputs of the model were assessed against the observed data using the coefficient of determination r 2 root mean square error rmse and the index of agreement d which were calculated as 3 r 2 i 1 n o i o s i s i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n s i s 2 2 4 rmse 1 n i 1 n s i o i 2 5 d 1 i 1 n s i o i 2 i 1 n s i o o i o 2 where o i and s i are the observed and simulated values respectively o and s are the average observed and simulated values respectively and n is the number of observations the three statistical indicators are commonly used to evaluate the performance of model r 2 represents the proportion of the variance in measured data explained by the model rmse measures the average magnitude of the difference between simulations and observations jacovides and kontoyiannis 1995 d is a measure of the degree to which the observed data are approached by the simulated data and overcomes the insensitivity of r 2 to systematic over or underestimations by the model legates and mccabe 1999 willmott 1984 when r 2 and d are close to 1 it indicates that the performance simulation performance is good it has been reported that the results from simulation are considered acceptable if r 2 0 5 or d 0 65 moriasi et al 2007 willmott 1984 as rmse approaches zero it presents a good match between the simulated and measured data 2 6 scenario simulations and analyses after validation the model was applied to predict the response of cotton productivity et yield and wue to irrigation amount and to search the appropriate irrigation amounts under various scenarios of initial swc and soil salinity in the two typical soils at this experimental site considering the soil texture and the deep groundwater at the experimental site in recent two years 2015 and 2016 the characteristics of the silty and sandy loams and a groundwater depth of 6 0m were used for the scenario simulations an analysis of 45 year meteorological data 1961 2005 for the city of korla collected by the meteorological data center of the china meteorological administration http data cma cn found no significant differences in rainfall during the growing season april to october among various hydrological years 58 2mm for wet years 42 9mm for normal years and 29 9mm for dry years the impact of rainfall variability on cotton growth was consequently not considered in the simulations the climatic data for 1982 were used as input in aquacrop for simulating the scenarios because these data were similar to the long term averages for the growing season the sowing date for cotton was assumed to be 24 april for the scenario simulations which was the average sowing date for the four experimental years based on the et of 489 554mm at the experimental site yang et al 2016 and moderately sensitive to water stress for cotton doorenbos and kassam 1979 the simulations were performed for irrigation amount of 100 600mm in 50 mm increments covering deficit full and over irrigation to better determine the response of cotton productivity to irrigation amount for simplicity a total of 15 irrigation events and same irrigation frequency every 5 7days were set for each scenario simulation irrigation started and ended at 44 and 128 das respectively with a salinity of 3 1dsm 1 consistent with that at the experimental site irrigation was withheld at seedling stage and mainly concentrated at squaring flowering and early boll stages the percentage of the soil surface wetted by drip irrigation was set at 40 considering the variability of swc and soil salinity in the field and cotton tolerance to water and salinity stress three swcs 100 85 and 75 fc and five soil salinities 1 8 12 16 and 20dsm 1 in 80 cm soil profile at sowing were set as the initial soil water and salinity conditions in the scenario simulations a total of 330 numerical simulations 11 irrigation amounts 3 initial swcs 5 initial salinities 2 soil textures were thus carried out an analysis of variance was used to investigate the differences in simulated et cotton yield and wue among the scenarios of soil texture initial swc and initial soil salinity according to the studies of zheng et al 2013 and wang et al 2014 relative yield yrel eq 9 and relative wue wuerel eq 10 were also used in our study to select the appropriate irrigation amounts related to the demand for high yield and wue under various scenarios of initial swc and soil salinity for two soils 6 wue 100 y et 7 y rel y y m 8 wue rel wue wue m where y is

3 and et is simulated evapotranspiration during the entire growing season mm 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration determining the crop parameters i e parameters for crop development and production as well as water and salinity stress was fundamental for calibrating aquacrop according to the recommended cotton parameters in the model manual reported by raes et al 2012 aquacrop was calibrated with the measured data sets from 2016 season the main crop parameters in the model are illustrated in table 3 as for parameters of canopy development cc at 90 emergence cco and at maximum development ccm were 1 21 and 95 respectively which were assumed as the averages for full irrigation during the four growing seasons coefficients for canopy growth cgc and decline cdc according to the change of cc during development and late in the season were estimated at 9 442 and 7 406 per day respectively higher than the recommended values 7 6 per day for cgc and 2 9 per day for cdc the difference is mainly due to the influence of crop cultivar the cotton root depth was fixed at 80cm from the studies of kang et al 2012 and tian et al 2016 on cotton under film mulched drip irrigation it was shallower than the root depth recommended by the model 2m which is attributed to the influences of film mulch and drip irrigation the root water exaction was set as 44mmday 1 which was derived from the study of li et al 2016 on the same site the normalized biomass water productivity wp is one of the important crop production parameters in aquacrop which is typically constant for a given crop species steduto et al 2009 specifically it is quantified as the slope of aboveground biomass versus normalized transpiration i e tr eto tr represents transpiration the calibrated wp value was adjusted from 15gm 2 the recommended value to 20gm 2 within the range of 15 20gm 2 for c3 plants recommended by the model manual the value of crop sink strength coefficient fsink was set at 60 higher than the recommended value 40 but within the range of 40 60 for cotton reported by vanuytrecht et al 2011 the value of the reduction coefficient for the products synthesized fyield was 72 slightly higher the recommended value of 70 the adjustment within limited ranges could be accepted because of difference in crop cultivar and location hsiao et al 2009 todorovic et al 2009 steduto et al 2012 the reference harvest index hio in the study was fixed at 40 to improve the simulation accuracy within the range of 25 40 suggested by the model manual as for the parameters of water stress response the values of the threshold of soil water depletion for canopy expansion stomatal conductance and canopy senescence were adjusted to 0 15 0 64 0 35 and 0 6 respectively which were lower than those suggested in the manual these adjustments are caused by shallow root distribution of cotton under film mulched drip irrigation making cotton growth sensitive to soil water in the salinity stress module of aquacrop the threshold values of ece for cotton were 8 35dsm 1 higher than that recommended by the manual 7 27dsm 1 the convex curve of the salinity stress coefficient with a shape factor of 2 5 also differed from the linear curve recommended by the manual similar to the adjustments in parameters of water stress response these differences are also attributed to the influence of film mulched drip irrigation which produced more tolerance to soil salinity for cotton growth with shallow root distribution considering the effect of soil salinity on canopy expansion stomatal closure and aboveground biomass the related shape factors of salinity stress response were first calibrated to make the simulation close to the realistic field conditions and their values are given in table 3 the results of calibration table 4 showed that the crop parameters in the model were adjusted well using the measured crop and soil data from the irrigation treatments of t15 t19 in 2016 season with r 2 0 63 and d 0 82 however the model applicability should be further validated under film mulched drip irrigation in the region of southern xinjiang 3 2 model validation 3 2 1 canopy cover cc aquacrop was validated using measured data from the irrigation treatments of t1 t14 in 2012 2013 and 2015 seasons the model satisfactorily simulated the seasonal trend in cc for all data from t1 t14 during the three validation seasons with r 2 of 0 89 rmse of 10 6 and d of 0 92 fig 4 and table 5 the model somewhat underestimated cc in t1 t4 at canopy development stage 31 51 das during 2012 season relative to the measured values fig 4 similar underestimations of simulation were also found in t11 and t13 at mid season stage 82 118 das in 2015 season these differences could be attributed to that the model did not consider the positive effect of film mulch on surface soil water salinity and temperature consequently giving more intense water and salinity stresses in the simulation than that in the measurement in addition the canopy senescence was overestimated and delayed in the simulations in 2013 season compared to the measured values perhaps because the crop coefficient for tr was a few percentage points higher than the recommended value of 1 15 in the calibrated model ahmadi et al 2015 hsiao et al 2009 so the simulations would have a better water supply than the observations similar adjustment in the crop coefficient for tr was found in the study of ran et al 2017 on aquacrop performance for maize under film mulched drip irrigation in an arid region of northwest china 3 2 2 soil water storage sws aquacrop predicted sws well in the 80 cm soil profile during the three validation growing seasons for all data of t1 t14 with r 2 of 0 74 rmse of 25 3mm and d of 0 92 fig 5 and table 6 the model also tended to slightly overestimate sws mostly in the deficit irrigation treatments of t9 t13 and t14 fig 5 the more informative depiction of variations in sws for t9 t13 and t14 are shown in fig 6 for individual 20 cm soil layer to better know the differences between the simulated and measured sws the simulated sws for the three treatments were close to the measured values for 0 20cm soil layer during the growing season except at late stage 120 145 das while the model overestimated sws in the three treatments for the other three layers except in t13 for 60 80cm layer and t14 for 60 80cm layer these overestimations in sws may also be because the crop coefficient for tr was not adjusted in the model similar differences have been found in the studies on the applications of aquacrop for maize katerji et al 2013 paredes et al 2014 cotton farahani et al 2009 hsiao et al 2009 hussein et al 2011 and canola zeleke et al 2011 paredes et al 2014 also reported that the partitioning of et needed to be modified in aquacrop based on the fao56 approach another reason for these differences may be the inaccurate simulation of root development based on the simple assumption in the model that the root depth growth is expressed as an empirical formula related to time and maximum effective root depth although the root development has taken into account the effects of water stress on root development it may not actually reflect the complex situation under film mulched drip irrigation and accurately simulate tr because of high variability of cotton root density ning et al 2015 it suggests that the calculation of root distribution in the aquacrop could add some parameters related to the root distribution such as root density or specific root length the overestimations in sws also may be associated with capillary rise from groundwater however the simulated amount of capillary rise was small data not shown mainly because the groundwater level was deeper than 2 5m during the four experimental years and sand content 40 was high in the soil at the experimental site 3 2 3 soil salinity crop growth is inevitably affected by soil salinity so accurate predictions of salinity are important for choosing a suitable irrigation strategy the performance of aquacrop on soil salinity however has not been thoroughly evaluated the model reliably simulated the average soil salinity in our 80 cm profile in the irrigation treatments of irel 80 with r 2 0 87 but underestimated ece in the irrigation treatments of irel 80 with r 2 0 32 figs 7 and 8 the underestimations are similar to the study of mohammadi et al 2016 on aquacrop application for winter wheat in eastern iran reported implying that some salt was leached from the soil profile by the irrigation water one reason for this could be inaccurate simulation in transpiration from simple root distribution calculation in the model discussed in section 3 2 2 another reason could be the simplification of soil salt transport calculation in the model which is based on some empirical functions including the parameters of ks the drainage coefficient for vertical downward salt movement and the diffusion coefficient for vertical salt diffusion as for coarse soil dominant salt movement is convection thus the drainage coefficient plays an important role on soil salinity simulation in the model under our experimental condition the coefficient is only related to ks and expressed by the empirical function of 0 0866 ks0 35 in fact salt transport is a complex process especially under film mulched drip irrigation and is controlled by many factors such as climate soil temperature and adsorption salt conservation and root water and nutrient uptake so it cannot be described well using the simply empirical functions it suggests that some parameters related to salt transport could be introduced in aquacrop to adjust soil salinity simulation such as parameters for soil adsorption and soil temperature 3 2 4 aboveground biomass and yield high r 2 0 77 and d 0 92 and low rmse 2 520tha 1 for all data from the irrigation treatments of t5 t14 demonstrated acceptable simulations in aboveground biomass fig 9 and table 7 consistent with the previous studies on aquacrop performance for cotton in southern spain garcía vila et al 2009 and northern syria farahani et al 2009 the simulated aboveground biomass however was slightly lower than the measurements after the day at ccm 88 das fig 9 in the model aboveground biomass was calculated from wp and tr so the discrepancies could be owing to the lower wp or to the lower simulated tr from an unadjusted crop coefficient for tr or underestimation of the root uptake to simulate tr well it requires exact estimation of crop coefficient from an accurate actual tr which can be determined based on water or energy balances by in situ real time monitoring water status or water flux as for cotton yield the model gave a reliable simulation in 2012 and 2013 seasons with r 2 0 85 and d 0 77 fig 10 and table 8 by comparison there was a poor simulation in 2015 season with r 2 of 0 01 and d of 0 3 mainly due to overestimations in t10 and t14 and underestimation in t13 data not shown from inaccurate simulations of swc soil salinity or hi consequently the simulations for all treatments t1 t14 during the three validation years were poor r 2 0 10 and d 0 57 however the slopes of the linear regression between the observed and simulated yield for 2012 2013 2015 and the three validation seasons were slightly lower than the ideal 1 0 by 4 3 8 6 4 3 and 6 1 respectively fig 10 implying that the model somewhat underestimated the cotton yield thus we considered the model was adequate to predict cotton yield under film mulched drip irrigation the validations for 2012 2013 and 2015 seasons under film mulched drip irrigation demonstrated that aquacrop can satisfactorily estimate cc sws and aboveground biomass as for soil salinity the model gave a good performance under irel 80 while produced low values of simulation under irel 80 as for cotton yield the model slightly underestimated it overall aquacrop can be used as a feasible tool for predicting cotton growth under film mulched drip irrigation in this arid region of southern xinjiang 3 3 scenario analysis optimizing the irrigation amount for cotton requires an understanding of the response of cotton productivity et yield and wue to irrigation amount on the other hand the response also depends on the variability in swc soil salinity and soil texture according to the water and salinity tolerance for cotton under film mulched drip irrigation and the soil texture in southern xinjiang a total of 330 numerical simulations 11 irrigation amounts 3 initial swcs 5 initial soil salinities 2 soil textures was conducted to investigate the responses of cotton productivity to irrigation amount and select appropriate irrigation amounts under various scenarios 3 3 1 response of et to irrigation amount et was strongly linearly correlated with the irrigation amounts of 500mm for both the silty and sandy loams under the various initial swcs and salinities fig 11 when et reached a maximum etm it did not increase with an additional increase in irrigation amount 500mm revealing that more irrigation water cannot be effectively used by cotton the irrigation amount for cotton should thus not exceed the etm for maximizing profits et was significantly affected by soil texture and initial swc p 0 01 table 9 it was higher in the silty loam than the sandy loam indicating that more water was provided in the silty loam because of the difference in water retention capacity araya et al 2016 moreover et increased with the increasing of initial swc as the initial soil salinity was higher than the low threshold value of ece for cotton 8dsm 1 et began to decline especially under the scenarios of low initial swc in the sandy loam which is consistent with the study of katerji et al 1998 reported that higher soil salinity produced lower et 3 3 2 response of cotton yield to irrigation amount the responses of cotton yield to irrigation amount under various conditions of initial swc and soil salinity are illustrated in fig 12 no yield data were simulated for an initial swc of 75 fc with an initial salinity of 20dsm 1 in sandy loam due to severe stresses of water and salinity fig 12f the relationship between the cotton yield and irrigation amount was also parabolic r 2 0 90 for the two soils in agreement with the previous studies of stewart and hagan 1973 and garcía vila et al 2009 yield sharply increased to a maximum near 450mm for the silty loam and 500mm for the sandy loam and then slightly decreased as irrigation amount increased demonstrating that more water or over irrigation could have an adverse impact on crop yield among the scenarios with irrigation amount of 150mm the highest yield was found in the silty loam with the initial swc of 85 fc and initial soil salinity of 20dsm 1 fig 12b suggesting that a certain salinity stress could have a positive effect on crop yield at low irrigation amounts soil texture initial swc and salinity and the interaction between texture and initial swc had significant impacts on yield p 0 05 table 9 in general the yield was higher in the silty loam than the sandy loam under the same conditions of initial soil water and salinity and irrigation amount the reason could be higher water retention in the silty loam which could provide more water and reduce water or salinity stresses for crop growth as compared with the sandy loam yield decreased as initial soil salinity increased particularly at a high initial swc or a large irrigation amount for the silty loam fig 12a c indicating that the soil salinity at sowing should be controlled to achieve the demand for high yield the results also showed that lower swc at sowing produced lower yield especially for the sandy loam revealing that proper irrigation at sowing could be required to decrease water stress for cotton growth at early stage 3 3 3 response of wue to irrigation amount wue is an important parameter for representing crop productivity it may also vary when crop is subjected to water deficits due to the variation of hi with irrigation amount garcía vila et al 2009 wue and irrigation amount for the silty and sandy loams also had parabolic relationships fig 13 wue increased sharply with the increasing of irrigation amount and reached a maximum at the irrigation amount of 300 400mm after which it decreased as irrigation amount increased indicating that a low or high irrigation amount can give a low crop productivity higher initial swc and lower initial soil salinity produced higher wue mainly because of higher yield from slighter stress 3 3 4 appropriate irrigation amount the appropriate irrigation amount could be determined based on the demand for high yield and wue yield and wue generally began to decrease slightly at the irrigation amount of 450 500 and 300 400mm respectively figs 12 and 13 so the appropriate irrigation amounts for cotton under the various scenarios of initial swc and soil salinity should mostly range from 300 to 500mm to avoid the loss of excess water and ensure high yield and wue according to the previous studies of zheng et al 2013 and wang et al 2014 simulated yield and wue were normalized by the maximum simulated yield and wue for different scenarios of initial swc and soil salinity to find the appropriate irrigation amount the responses of yrel and wuerel to irrigation amount were similar to those of yield and wue and their relationships could be also described by a quadratic function of irrigation amount an appropriate irrigation amount can consequently be determined based on the response functions of yrel and wuerel to irrigation amount for example the appropriate irrigation amount was 470mm for the scenario with an initial swc of 100 fc and an initial salinity of 1dsm 1 for silty loam fig 14 similar results for the other scenarios of initial swc and soil salinity can be also obtained from the two response functions of yrel and wuerel the appropriate irrigation amounts for the various scenarios of initial swc and soil salinity for the two soils at the experimental site are listed in table 10 the appropriate irrigation amounts for cotton ranged from 358 to 457mm for the silty loam and from 406 to 462mm for the sandy loam respectively table 10 cai et al 2002 reported that the proper irrigation amount ranged from 240 to 345mm in the shihezi region of northern xinjiang lower than those in our study the differences were likely because of different climate soil texture and quality of irrigation water our results also showed that the appropriate irrigation amounts were higher for the sandy loam than the silty loam indicating that cotton growth required more water or high irrigation frequency in sandy loam because of the lower water holding capacity et ranged from 448 7 to 579 3mm for the silty loam and from 413 4 to 527 5mm for the sandy loam under the conditions of appropriate irrigation amount close to the study of yang et al 2016 reported that et ranged from 489 to 554mm with an irrigation amount of 435 591mm for 2012 2014 at the same experimental site in addition to soil texture the appropriate irrigation amount also depended on the initial swc and soil salinity it increased with the increase in initial swc while decreased with the increase in initial soil salinity implying that the relative high irrigation amount is required under high swc and low soil salinity because of a good crop growth from slight stress according to the above results a reasonable irrigation amount could provide a reference for cotton under film mulched drip irrigation in southern xinjiang and other similar regions when the status of soil water and salinity at sowing are given within the recommended ranges of appropriate irrigation amount in the two soils i e 358 457mm for silty loam and 406 462mm for sandy loam the relatively large irrigation amount could be used under high swc and low soil salinity at sowing by comparison the relatively small irrigation amount could be used under low swc and high soil salinity at sowing as for high soil salinity at sowing the irrigation could be conducted to reduce the salinity stress at certain degree 4 conclusions the data from a four year field experiment 2012 2013 2015 and 2016 on cotton were used to evaluate the performance of aquacrop under film mulched drip irrigation in an arid region of southern xinjiang china based on the recommended parameters for cotton in aquacrop manual the 2016 data sets were used to calibrate the model and the data sets for other three years were used for the process of model validation aquacrop can satisfactorily simulate the changes in cc sws in the 80 cm soil profile and aboveground biomass with r 2 0 77 and d 0 92 whereas slightly underestimate cotton yield as for soil salinity the model performed well in the treatments of irel 80 r 2 0 87 and underestimated in the treatments of irel 80 r 2 0 32 the disagreements between simulated and measured soil salinity could be due to the simplicity in calculation of the salt movement and root distribution in the model implying that the algorithms of soil salinity distribution and root development in the model require farther modification overall aquacrop can be used as a reliable tool for predicting the cotton growth responses to water under film mulched drip irrigation in this region of southern xinjiang after validation the simulations with aquacrop were carried out under various scenarios 11 irrigation amounts 3 initial swcs 5 initial salinities 2 soil textures with film mulched drip irrigation the outputs of these simulations indicated that soil texture and initial swc had important effects on et and yield consequently affecting wue following the local cropping system and irrigation frequency the seasonal irrigation amounts were recommended at 358 457mm for the silty loam and 406 462mm for the sandy loam based on the demand for high yield and wue the irrigation amount also depended on soil water and salinity at sowing specifically within the suggested range of seasonal irrigation amount the relatively large water amount could be applied under high swc and low soil salinity at sowing and the relatively small water amount could be used under low swc and high soil salinity at sowing the recommendation could provide a reference for irrigation management on cotton under film mulched drip irrigation in southern xinjiang and other similar regions the appropriate irrigation amount however also depends on planting date water quality irrigation frequency and depth of groundwater further studies are thus needed for optimizing irrigation strategies in this region acknowledgements this

11602,aquacrop is a model of crop growth for predicting responses to various scenarios such as climates and irrigation strategies few studies however have assessed the applicability of aquacrop for cotton under film mulched drip irrigation in salt affected soil the objectives of this study were to test aquacrop performance and to determine the appropriate irrigation amounts for cotton under several scenarios of initial soil water content swc and soil salinity for two typical soils in a saline region of southern xinjiang of china with film mulched drip irrigation a four year irrigation experiment was conducted in 2012 2013 2015 and 2016 growing seasons for cotton covering full 100 over 115 and 145 of full and deficit 55 90 of full irrigation treatments based on the recommended parameters for cotton in aquacrop manual the model was calibrated using 2016 data sets and validated using the data sets from the other three years simulations of canopy cover soil water storage of the root zone and aboveground biomass fitted well with the field observations with coefficient of determination r 2 0 77 and the index of agreement d 0 92 and slightly underestimated yield as for soil salinity the model gave a reliable simulation for less than 80 of full irrigation treatments while underestimated for over 80 of full irrigation treatments overall aquacrop can be used as a feasible tool to predict cotton growth response to water under film mulched drip irrigation in this region according to the principle of high yield and wue the simulation results showed that the appropriate irrigation amounts were recommended at 358 457mm for silty loam and 406 462mm for sandy loam in this region which can provide a reference for irrigation optimization under film mulched drip irrigation in southern xinjiang and other similar regions keywords film mulched drip irrigation aquacrop model cotton growth soil water soil salinity 1 introduction film mulched drip irrigation combines the benefits of drip irrigation and film mulch to surface soil and can effectively decrease evaporation from soil ayars et al 1999 batchelor et al 1996 and prevent the risk of soil degradation by soil salinization wang et al 2011 this practice has been widely promoted in arid or semiarid regions to avoid water resources waste and improve water use efficiency wue for crops e g díaz pérez and eaton 2015 filipović et al 2016 li et al 2017 yang et al 2016 and others on the other hand excessive water tends to be applied to ensure a suitable soil water salt environment for crop growth in arid or semiarid regions due to drought and soil salinization that have strong impacts on water resources and soil quality particularly for summer crops such as cotton that have high water requirements because of the high evaporative demands during their growing seasons garcía vila et al 2009 even though using the water saving pattern of film mulched drip irrigation it could give rise to the series of problems detrimental to sustainable development of agriculture such as nutrient loss and low crop water productivity in this context developing appropriate irrigation strategies is a feasible approach to solve this problem it thus requires the knowledge of the crops responses to irrigation amount under different scenarios e g soil water and salinity and climate with film mulched drip irrigation applying crop simulation models such as cropwat smith 1992 dssat jones et al 2003 wofost van diepen et al 1989 and cropsyst stöckle et al 2003 can be helpful to simulate crop growth under various conditions for optimizing irrigation most of these models however require a large number of input parameters and advanced modeling skills for their calibration and simulation heng et al 2009 among these models aquacrop a water driven model for simulating crop water productivity developed by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations can be applied widely in space and time by normalizing a water productivity parameter for climate both evaporative demand and atmospheric co2 concentration hsiao et al 2009 steduto et al 2009 this model has fewer input parameters than other crop simulation models e g dssat and wofost previous studies have indicated that aquacrop can perform well in predictions of crop growth and productivity and can be applied to optimize irrigation strategies farahani et al 2009 have firstly parameterized and tested aquacrop on cotton with experimental data of three growing seasons collected in north syria under full and deficit irrigation levels with drip irrigation their results showed that the model gave an accurate prediction of evapotranspiration et garcía vila et al 2009 found that aquacrop could adequately estimate the cotton yield response to applied irrigation water they then obtained optimum applied irrigation using an economic optimization procedure wang et al 2013 noted that aquacrop provided a reliable performance on the biomass and yield of winter wheat growth under full and deficit conditions using five year experiment data and determined a minimum irrigation amount to achieve high wue for different hydrologic years kumar et al 2014 evaluated aquacrop performance for four wheat varieties under saline water irrigation in northern india and reported that the model could be used to predict the wheat yield with acceptable accuracy under different saline water irrigations voloudakis et al 2015 in seven areas of greece verified a good performance of aquacrop for cotton yield prediction using three year experiment data and obtained cotton yield response to climate change for these reasons aquacrop may be a suitable tool for crop productivity predictions under various conditions cotton is one of important cash crops in southern xinjiang of china where has favorable heat and sunlight conditions most cotton fields are irrigated using the pattern of film mulched drip irrigation in the case of cotton the performance of aquacrop has not been evaluated under film mulched drip irrigation in southern xinjiang especially for saline soil in this region where crop yields are often restricted by limited water resources and soil salinity the main purposes of this study were to test the performance of aquacrop for cotton growth under film mulched drip irrigation using four year field experiment data and to find the appropriate irrigation amount under different scenarios of initial soil water content swc and soil salinity in two typical soils of southern xinjiang 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description the experimental site was located at the bazhou irrigation experimental station 41 35 n 86 09 e 901m a s l in the suburbs of korla in southern xinjiang an autonomous region in northwestern china the area has a continental desert climate with an annual precipitation and maximum potential evaporation 20 cm diameter evaporation pan of approximate 58 and 2788 2mm respectively the long term seasonal april to october reference evapotranspiration eto and rainfall are 950 and 47mm respectively the average maximum and minimum temperatures during the growing season for cotton are 29 1 and 15 8 c respectively the predominant soil textures at this site are silty loam 41 4 sand 54 4 silt and 4 2 clay and sandy loam 50 2 sand 46 0 silt and 3 8 clay based on the soil taxonomy of the united states department of agriculture the average bulk density in the 1 m soil profile is 1 56gcm 3 the saturated swc θs field capacity fc permanent wilting point pwp and saturated hydraulic conductivity ks at the site are listed in table 1 the soil salt content in the field varies from 3 24 to 13 5gkg 1 from slightly to moderately saline the average depth of groundwater was about 2 6m in 2012 and 2013 since the groundwater was overused its average depth declined to 6 0m in 2015 and 2016 2 2 experimental setup the irrigation experiment was conducted in 2012 2013 2015 and 2016 growing seasons no experiment was arranged in 2014 season due to a low emergence rate caused by cold weather and strong wind the irrigation water was derived from groundwater with a salinity of 3 1dsm 1 the conventional irrigation amount in this region was 525mm based on annual water requirement for cotton we used the conventional irrigation as full irrigation the irrigation treatments during the four growing seasons were set in proportion relative to the full irrigation irel and the detailed information are listed in table 2 i as for 2012 season only four deficit irrigation treatments 525mm t1 t4 were arranged i e approximate 80 70 65 and 55 of full irrigation ii as for 2013 season five irrigation treatments t5 t9 were set covering full and deficit irrigation i e approximate 100 90 85 80 and 70 of full irrigation iii as for 2015 season five irrigation treatments t10 t14 were tested covering over 525mm full and deficit irrigation i e approximate 145 115 100 85 and 55 of full irrigation iv as for 2016 season five irrigation treatments t15 t19 were conducted covering full and deficit irrigation i e approximate 100 90 70 65 and 55 of full irrigation as for 2012 season because the full irrigation was not set the irrigation frequency followed with the local practice and the water amount per irrigation event for t2 t4 was proportionally reduced relative to that for t1 in the over and deficit irrigation treatments during 2013 2015 and 2016 seasons irrigation occurred on the same day as the fully irrigated plots but the duration of irrigation application was increased or reduced to the irel of full irrigation the detailed irrigation schedules for all treatments during the four growing seasons are displayed in fig 1 the irrigation mainly concentrated at squaring flowering and early boll stages 55 115 das it began in mid or late june and ended in late august in the four experimental years table 2 the field was irrigated 11 12 15 and 13 times in 2012 2013 2015 and 2016 growing seasons respectively the difference in the irrigation times among the four seasons was attributed to the irregular rainfall distribution during the four growing seasons the irrigation amount for each treatment was recorded by a flow meter these irrigation treatments were arranged in a randomized complete block design with two replicate plots of 7 7m adjacent plots were separated by 1m to eliminate the effect of the lateral movement of soil water following the local practice the field was drip irrigated with film mulch and the drip lines were arranged with a pattern of one film two drip lines and four rows i e four rows of cotton were irrigated using two drip lines with emitter intervals of 30cm and covered by one strip of white plastic mulch 110cm wide fig 2 the drip tape had an inside diameter of 16mm and an emitter discharge rate of 2 0lh 1 the width of the strip of bare soil between mulches was 30cm 2 3 agronomic practices cotton gossypium hirsutum l was sown after plowing on 1 may 2012 26 april 2013 22 april 2015 and 20 april 2016 at a density of 22 seeds m 2 table 2 the field was flooded in mid april each year two weeks before sowing to provide sufficient water and to leach salt from the soil for cotton emergence and seedling growth the total amount of flood irrigation was about 300mm for each year and the water was derived from the kongque river with a salinity of 0 8dsm 1 inorganic fertilizers 225kgha 1 urea with 46 4 n 375kgha 1 diammonium phosphate with 46 p2o5 and 18 n and 300kgha 1 potassium sulfate with 45 k2o were applied before sowing following local agronomic practices at squaring and flowering stages 600kgha 1 urea 98kgha 1 diammonium phosphate and 88kgha 1 potassium sulfate were applied herbicides were used before planting pesticides were applied every 5 7days from seedling to boll stages with a sprayer pump and the plants were manually topped at the end of july 2 4 data collection and calculations 2 4 1 meteorological data meteorological data for rainfall solar radiation maximum and minimum air temperatures relative humidity and wind speed at a height of 2m were collected hourly by a davis wireless vantage pro2 weather station davis instruments hayward usa installed about 30m away from the experimental field the daily eto calculated using the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 for 2012 2013 2015 and 2016 seasons are shown in fig 3 eto did not differ significantly during the four growing seasons in 2012 and 2013 seasons the rainfall mainly distributed at 40 100days after sowing das as for 2016 season two heavy rainfalls 33 3 and 42 9mm were recorded at 80 and 126 das as for 2015 season the rainfall was much lower than that in the other three seasons thus more irrigation water was required for cotton growth in 2015 2 4 2 measurement of soil water content swc and soil salinity soil samples were collected by using an auger with 5 cm diameter for measuring swc and soil salinity at 20 cm intervals from 0 to 80cm depth in the middles of the wide narrow and bare strips for calculating the average swc and soil salinity in the root zone over the four seasons the samples were collected at sowing the main growth stages seedling squaring and early and late boll stages one day before irrigation every 10 30days and harvest swc and soil salinity were additionally measured at the flowering stage in 2016 season all auger holes were refilled with soil to minimize the experimental error after each sampling the samples were weighed dried in a fan assisted oven at 105 2 c for 24h and reweighed to determine the gravimetric swc volumetric swc was calculated by multiplying gravimetric swc with average bulk density the dried samples were ground and sieved 2mm and the electrical conductivity for each sample was measured in a 1 5 soil water extract ec1 5 at 25 c using a dds 307a conductivity meter shanghai precision scientific instrument inc shanghai china the electrical conductivity of saturation extract ece was estimated using measured ec1 5 based on an empirical expression reported by slavich and petterson 1993 1 ece 2 46 3 03 θ sp ec1 5 n 344 r 2 0 993 where θsp is the gravimetric water content of saturated paste gg 1 at our experimental site the values of θsp were 0 27 and 0 23gg 1 for silty loam and sandy loam respectively 2 4 3 cotton growth measurements sowing date and das to emergence squaring flowering senescence and maturity were recorded in all four years six plants in each plot were randomly selected to monitor the maximum length and width of all green leaves every 10 15days during the growing season the leaf area was calculated by maximum leaf length width of one side of each leaf multiplied by a factor of 0 703 ran et al 2017 zhang et al 2008 which was derived from the linear regression r 2 0 943 n 38 of the calculated and measured leaf area the measured leaf area was determined by using an am 300 leaf area meter adc bioscientific ltd uk leaf area index lai was calculated by multiplying the total green leaf area per plant with actual plant density the canopy cover cc was estimated using lai based on the empirical equation reported by garcía vila et al 2009 2 cc 1 exp lai 1 3 1 exp lai 1 3 three plants from each plot were collected cut and then oven dried at 70 c to constant weights ertek and kanber 2001 yazar et al 2002 to determine the aboveground biomass at intervals of 10 30days cotton yield seeds and lint for each plot was measured at harvest by hand harvesting in an area of 6 67m2 with three replications for 2012 season crop data were less regorous than that for the other three seasons with no aboveground biomass data but detailed soil cc and yield data were available 2 5 model calibration and validation the underlying principles and main algorithms in aquacrop have been described by steduto et al 2009 and raes et al 2009 2012 in case of cotton the recommended values for the cotton parameters were provided in aquacrop manual reported by raes et al 2012 some of these parameters are not universal and need be adjusted to local conditions and the studied cultivars thus calibration and validation of the model should be necessary to evaluate the model feasibility under our experimental condition due to no aboveground biomass data in 2012 season the model was calibrated with measured data of the five irrigation treatments in 2016 season t15 t19 including full and deficit irrigation treatments and complete soil and crop data the percentage of soil cover by film mulch was set at 80 the phenological development of the cotton was obtained at our site using the averages of the four growing seasons 9 das for emergence 55 das for flowering 74 das for maximum root depth 82 das for maximum canopy 118 das for senescence and 160 das for maturity the durations of the flowering and yield formation periods were fixed at 30 and 63days respectively the input data for initial swc and soil salinity were the field measurements at sowing the other crop parameters were fine tuned based on the recommended parameters for cotton in aquacrop manual reporeted by raes et al 2012 the calibrations were run in day mode first fitting the performance of the full irrigation treatment t17 for cc and aboveground biomass and then testing soil water storage sws soil salinity and yield the crop parameters determined with t17 were repeatedly modified until the simulated and observed values sws soil salinity cc aboveground biomass and yield agreed acceptably well for all five treatments in 2016 after calibration the model was validated using the measured data sets from 2012 2013 and 2015 seasons the outputs of the model were assessed against the observed data using the coefficient of determination r 2 root mean square error rmse and the index of agreement d which were calculated as 3 r 2 i 1 n o i o s i s i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n s i s 2 2 4 rmse 1 n i 1 n s i o i 2 5 d 1 i 1 n s i o i 2 i 1 n s i o o i o 2 where o i and s i are the observed and simulated values respectively o and s are the average observed and simulated values respectively and n is the number of observations the three statistical indicators are commonly used to evaluate the performance of model r 2 represents the proportion of the variance in measured data explained by the model rmse measures the average magnitude of the difference between simulations and observations jacovides and kontoyiannis 1995 d is a measure of the degree to which the observed data are approached by the simulated data and overcomes the insensitivity of r 2 to systematic over or underestimations by the model legates and mccabe 1999 willmott 1984 when r 2 and d are close to 1 it indicates that the performance simulation performance is good it has been reported that the results from simulation are considered acceptable if r 2 0 5 or d 0 65 moriasi et al 2007 willmott 1984 as rmse approaches zero it presents a good match between the simulated and measured data 2 6 scenario simulations and analyses after validation the model was applied to predict the response of cotton productivity et yield and wue to irrigation amount and to search the appropriate irrigation amounts under various scenarios of initial swc and soil salinity in the two typical soils at this experimental site considering the soil texture and the deep groundwater at the experimental site in recent two years 2015 and 2016 the characteristics of the silty and sandy loams and a groundwater depth of 6 0m were used for the scenario simulations an analysis of 45 year meteorological data 1961 2005 for the city of korla collected by the meteorological data center of the china meteorological administration http data cma cn found no significant differences in rainfall during the growing season april to october among various hydrological years 58 2mm for wet years 42 9mm for normal years and 29 9mm for dry years the impact of rainfall variability on cotton growth was consequently not considered in the simulations the climatic data for 1982 were used as input in aquacrop for simulating the scenarios because these data were similar to the long term averages for the growing season the sowing date for cotton was assumed to be 24 april for the scenario simulations which was the average sowing date for the four experimental years based on the et of 489 554mm at the experimental site yang et al 2016 and moderately sensitive to water stress for cotton doorenbos and kassam 1979 the simulations were performed for irrigation amount of 100 600mm in 50 mm increments covering deficit full and over irrigation to better determine the response of cotton productivity to irrigation amount for simplicity a total of 15 irrigation events and same irrigation frequency every 5 7days were set for each scenario simulation irrigation started and ended at 44 and 128 das respectively with a salinity of 3 1dsm 1 consistent with that at the experimental site irrigation was withheld at seedling stage and mainly concentrated at squaring flowering and early boll stages the percentage of the soil surface wetted by drip irrigation was set at 40 considering the variability of swc and soil salinity in the field and cotton tolerance to water and salinity stress three swcs 100 85 and 75 fc and five soil salinities 1 8 12 16 and 20dsm 1 in 80 cm soil profile at sowing were set as the initial soil water and salinity conditions in the scenario simulations a total of 330 numerical simulations 11 irrigation amounts 3 initial swcs 5 initial salinities 2 soil textures were thus carried out an analysis of variance was used to investigate the differences in simulated et cotton yield and wue among the scenarios of soil texture initial swc and initial soil salinity according to the studies of zheng et al 2013 and wang et al 2014 relative yield yrel eq 9 and relative wue wuerel eq 10 were also used in our study to select the appropriate irrigation amounts related to the demand for high yield and wue under various scenarios of initial swc and soil salinity for two soils 6 wue 100 y et 7 y rel y y m 8 wue rel wue wue m where y is

3 and et is simulated evapotranspiration during the entire growing season mm 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration determining the crop parameters i e parameters for crop development and production as well as water and salinity stress was fundamental for calibrating aquacrop according to the recommended cotton parameters in the model manual reported by raes et al 2012 aquacrop was calibrated with the measured data sets from 2016 season the main crop parameters in the model are illustrated in table 3 as for parameters of canopy development cc at 90 emergence cco and at maximum development ccm were 1 21 and 95 respectively which were assumed as the averages for full irrigation during the four growing seasons coefficients for canopy growth cgc and decline cdc according to the change of cc during development and late in the season were estimated at 9 442 and 7 406 per day respectively higher than the recommended values 7 6 per day for cgc and 2 9 per day for cdc the difference is mainly due to the influence of crop cultivar the cotton root depth was fixed at 80cm from the studies of kang et al 2012 and tian et al 2016 on cotton under film mulched drip irrigation it was shallower than the root depth recommended by the model 2m which is attributed to the influences of film mulch and drip irrigation the root water exaction was set as 44mmday 1 which was derived from the study of li et al 2016 on the same site the normalized biomass water productivity wp is one of the important crop production parameters in aquacrop which is typically constant for a given crop species steduto et al 2009 specifically it is quantified as the slope of aboveground biomass versus normalized transpiration i e tr eto tr represents transpiration the calibrated wp value was adjusted from 15gm 2 the recommended value to 20gm 2 within the range of 15 20gm 2 for c3 plants recommended by the model manual the value of crop sink strength coefficient fsink was set at 60 higher than the recommended value 40 but within the range of 40 60 for cotton reported by vanuytrecht et al 2011 the value of the reduction coefficient for the products synthesized fyield was 72 slightly higher the recommended value of 70 the adjustment within limited ranges could be accepted because of difference in crop cultivar and location hsiao et al 2009 todorovic et al 2009 steduto et al 2012 the reference harvest index hio in the study was fixed at 40 to improve the simulation accuracy within the range of 25 40 suggested by the model manual as for the parameters of water stress response the values of the threshold of soil water depletion for canopy expansion stomatal conductance and canopy senescence were adjusted to 0 15 0 64 0 35 and 0 6 respectively which were lower than those suggested in the manual these adjustments are caused by shallow root distribution of cotton under film mulched drip irrigation making cotton growth sensitive to soil water in the salinity stress module of aquacrop the threshold values of ece for cotton were 8 35dsm 1 higher than that recommended by the manual 7 27dsm 1 the convex curve of the salinity stress coefficient with a shape factor of 2 5 also differed from the linear curve recommended by the manual similar to the adjustments in parameters of water stress response these differences are also attributed to the influence of film mulched drip irrigation which produced more tolerance to soil salinity for cotton growth with shallow root distribution considering the effect of soil salinity on canopy expansion stomatal closure and aboveground biomass the related shape factors of salinity stress response were first calibrated to make the simulation close to the realistic field conditions and their values are given in table 3 the results of calibration table 4 showed that the crop parameters in the model were adjusted well using the measured crop and soil data from the irrigation treatments of t15 t19 in 2016 season with r 2 0 63 and d 0 82 however the model applicability should be further validated under film mulched drip irrigation in the region of southern xinjiang 3 2 model validation 3 2 1 canopy cover cc aquacrop was validated using measured data from the irrigation treatments of t1 t14 in 2012 2013 and 2015 seasons the model satisfactorily simulated the seasonal trend in cc for all data from t1 t14 during the three validation seasons with r 2 of 0 89 rmse of 10 6 and d of 0 92 fig 4 and table 5 the model somewhat underestimated cc in t1 t4 at canopy development stage 31 51 das during 2012 season relative to the measured values fig 4 similar underestimations of simulation were also found in t11 and t13 at mid season stage 82 118 das in 2015 season these differences could be attributed to that the model did not consider the positive effect of film mulch on surface soil water salinity and temperature consequently giving more intense water and salinity stresses in the simulation than that in the measurement in addition the canopy senescence was overestimated and delayed in the simulations in 2013 season compared to the measured values perhaps because the crop coefficient for tr was a few percentage points higher than the recommended value of 1 15 in the calibrated model ahmadi et al 2015 hsiao et al 2009 so the simulations would have a better water supply than the observations similar adjustment in the crop coefficient for tr was found in the study of ran et al 2017 on aquacrop performance for maize under film mulched drip irrigation in an arid region of northwest china 3 2 2 soil water storage sws aquacrop predicted sws well in the 80 cm soil profile during the three validation growing seasons for all data of t1 t14 with r 2 of 0 74 rmse of 25 3mm and d of 0 92 fig 5 and table 6 the model also tended to slightly overestimate sws mostly in the deficit irrigation treatments of t9 t13 and t14 fig 5 the more informative depiction of variations in sws for t9 t13 and t14 are shown in fig 6 for individual 20 cm soil layer to better know the differences between the simulated and measured sws the simulated sws for the three treatments were close to the measured values for 0 20cm soil layer during the growing season except at late stage 120 145 das while the model overestimated sws in the three treatments for the other three layers except in t13 for 60 80cm layer and t14 for 60 80cm layer these overestimations in sws may also be because the crop coefficient for tr was not adjusted in the model similar differences have been found in the studies on the applications of aquacrop for maize katerji et al 2013 paredes et al 2014 cotton farahani et al 2009 hsiao et al 2009 hussein et al 2011 and canola zeleke et al 2011 paredes et al 2014 also reported that the partitioning of et needed to be modified in aquacrop based on the fao56 approach another reason for these differences may be the inaccurate simulation of root development based on the simple assumption in the model that the root depth growth is expressed as an empirical formula related to time and maximum effective root depth although the root development has taken into account the effects of water stress on root development it may not actually reflect the complex situation under film mulched drip irrigation and accurately simulate tr because of high variability of cotton root density ning et al 2015 it suggests that the calculation of root distribution in the aquacrop could add some parameters related to the root distribution such as root density or specific root length the overestimations in sws also may be associated with capillary rise from groundwater however the simulated amount of capillary rise was small data not shown mainly because the groundwater level was deeper than 2 5m during the four experimental years and sand content 40 was high in the soil at the experimental site 3 2 3 soil salinity crop growth is inevitably affected by soil salinity so accurate predictions of salinity are important for choosing a suitable irrigation strategy the performance of aquacrop on soil salinity however has not been thoroughly evaluated the model reliably simulated the average soil salinity in our 80 cm profile in the irrigation treatments of irel 80 with r 2 0 87 but underestimated ece in the irrigation treatments of irel 80 with r 2 0 32 figs 7 and 8 the underestimations are similar to the study of mohammadi et al 2016 on aquacrop application for winter wheat in eastern iran reported implying that some salt was leached from the soil profile by the irrigation water one reason for this could be inaccurate simulation in transpiration from simple root distribution calculation in the model discussed in section 3 2 2 another reason could be the simplification of soil salt transport calculation in the model which is based on some empirical functions including the parameters of ks the drainage coefficient for vertical downward salt movement and the diffusion coefficient for vertical salt diffusion as for coarse soil dominant salt movement is convection thus the drainage coefficient plays an important role on soil salinity simulation in the model under our experimental condition the coefficient is only related to ks and expressed by the empirical function of 0 0866 ks0 35 in fact salt transport is a complex process especially under film mulched drip irrigation and is controlled by many factors such as climate soil temperature and adsorption salt conservation and root water and nutrient uptake so it cannot be described well using the simply empirical functions it suggests that some parameters related to salt transport could be introduced in aquacrop to adjust soil salinity simulation such as parameters for soil adsorption and soil temperature 3 2 4 aboveground biomass and yield high r 2 0 77 and d 0 92 and low rmse 2 520tha 1 for all data from the irrigation treatments of t5 t14 demonstrated acceptable simulations in aboveground biomass fig 9 and table 7 consistent with the previous studies on aquacrop performance for cotton in southern spain garcía vila et al 2009 and northern syria farahani et al 2009 the simulated aboveground biomass however was slightly lower than the measurements after the day at ccm 88 das fig 9 in the model aboveground biomass was calculated from wp and tr so the discrepancies could be owing to the lower wp or to the lower simulated tr from an unadjusted crop coefficient for tr or underestimation of the root uptake to simulate tr well it requires exact estimation of crop coefficient from an accurate actual tr which can be determined based on water or energy balances by in situ real time monitoring water status or water flux as for cotton yield the model gave a reliable simulation in 2012 and 2013 seasons with r 2 0 85 and d 0 77 fig 10 and table 8 by comparison there was a poor simulation in 2015 season with r 2 of 0 01 and d of 0 3 mainly due to overestimations in t10 and t14 and underestimation in t13 data not shown from inaccurate simulations of swc soil salinity or hi consequently the simulations for all treatments t1 t14 during the three validation years were poor r 2 0 10 and d 0 57 however the slopes of the linear regression between the observed and simulated yield for 2012 2013 2015 and the three validation seasons were slightly lower than the ideal 1 0 by 4 3 8 6 4 3 and 6 1 respectively fig 10 implying that the model somewhat underestimated the cotton yield thus we considered the model was adequate to predict cotton yield under film mulched drip irrigation the validations for 2012 2013 and 2015 seasons under film mulched drip irrigation demonstrated that aquacrop can satisfactorily estimate cc sws and aboveground biomass as for soil salinity the model gave a good performance under irel 80 while produced low values of simulation under irel 80 as for cotton yield the model slightly underestimated it overall aquacrop can be used as a feasible tool for predicting cotton growth under film mulched drip irrigation in this arid region of southern xinjiang 3 3 scenario analysis optimizing the irrigation amount for cotton requires an understanding of the response of cotton productivity et yield and wue to irrigation amount on the other hand the response also depends on the variability in swc soil salinity and soil texture according to the water and salinity tolerance for cotton under film mulched drip irrigation and the soil texture in southern xinjiang a total of 330 numerical simulations 11 irrigation amounts 3 initial swcs 5 initial soil salinities 2 soil textures was conducted to investigate the responses of cotton productivity to irrigation amount and select appropriate irrigation amounts under various scenarios 3 3 1 response of et to irrigation amount et was strongly linearly correlated with the irrigation amounts of 500mm for both the silty and sandy loams under the various initial swcs and salinities fig 11 when et reached a maximum etm it did not increase with an additional increase in irrigation amount 500mm revealing that more irrigation water cannot be effectively used by cotton the irrigation amount for cotton should thus not exceed the etm for maximizing profits et was significantly affected by soil texture and initial swc p 0 01 table 9 it was higher in the silty loam than the sandy loam indicating that more water was provided in the silty loam because of the difference in water retention capacity araya et al 2016 moreover et increased with the increasing of initial swc as the initial soil salinity was higher than the low threshold value of ece for cotton 8dsm 1 et began to decline especially under the scenarios of low initial swc in the sandy loam which is consistent with the study of katerji et al 1998 reported that higher soil salinity produced lower et 3 3 2 response of cotton yield to irrigation amount the responses of cotton yield to irrigation amount under various conditions of initial swc and soil salinity are illustrated in fig 12 no yield data were simulated for an initial swc of 75 fc with an initial salinity of 20dsm 1 in sandy loam due to severe stresses of water and salinity fig 12f the relationship between the cotton yield and irrigation amount was also parabolic r 2 0 90 for the two soils in agreement with the previous studies of stewart and hagan 1973 and garcía vila et al 2009 yield sharply increased to a maximum near 450mm for the silty loam and 500mm for the sandy loam and then slightly decreased as irrigation amount increased demonstrating that more water or over irrigation could have an adverse impact on crop yield among the scenarios with irrigation amount of 150mm the highest yield was found in the silty loam with the initial swc of 85 fc and initial soil salinity of 20dsm 1 fig 12b suggesting that a certain salinity stress could have a positive effect on crop yield at low irrigation amounts soil texture initial swc and salinity and the interaction between texture and initial swc had significant impacts on yield p 0 05 table 9 in general the yield was higher in the silty loam than the sandy loam under the same conditions of initial soil water and salinity and irrigation amount the reason could be higher water retention in the silty loam which could provide more water and reduce water or salinity stresses for crop growth as compared with the sandy loam yield decreased as initial soil salinity increased particularly at a high initial swc or a large irrigation amount for the silty loam fig 12a c indicating that the soil salinity at sowing should be controlled to achieve the demand for high yield the results also showed that lower swc at sowing produced lower yield especially for the sandy loam revealing that proper irrigation at sowing could be required to decrease water stress for cotton growth at early stage 3 3 3 response of wue to irrigation amount wue is an important parameter for representing crop productivity it may also vary when crop is subjected to water deficits due to the variation of hi with irrigation amount garcía vila et al 2009 wue and irrigation amount for the silty and sandy loams also had parabolic relationships fig 13 wue increased sharply with the increasing of irrigation amount and reached a maximum at the irrigation amount of 300 400mm after which it decreased as irrigation amount increased indicating that a low or high irrigation amount can give a low crop productivity higher initial swc and lower initial soil salinity produced higher wue mainly because of higher yield from slighter stress 3 3 4 appropriate irrigation amount the appropriate irrigation amount could be determined based on the demand for high yield and wue yield and wue generally began to decrease slightly at the irrigation amount of 450 500 and 300 400mm respectively figs 12 and 13 so the appropriate irrigation amounts for cotton under the various scenarios of initial swc and soil salinity should mostly range from 300 to 500mm to avoid the loss of excess water and ensure high yield and wue according to the previous studies of zheng et al 2013 and wang et al 2014 simulated yield and wue were normalized by the maximum simulated yield and wue for different scenarios of initial swc and soil salinity to find the appropriate irrigation amount the responses of yrel and wuerel to irrigation amount were similar to those of yield and wue and their relationships could be also described by a quadratic function of irrigation amount an appropriate irrigation amount can consequently be determined based on the response functions of yrel and wuerel to irrigation amount for example the appropriate irrigation amount was 470mm for the scenario with an initial swc of 100 fc and an initial salinity of 1dsm 1 for silty loam fig 14 similar results for the other scenarios of initial swc and soil salinity can be also obtained from the two response functions of yrel and wuerel the appropriate irrigation amounts for the various scenarios of initial swc and soil salinity for the two soils at the experimental site are listed in table 10 the appropriate irrigation amounts for cotton ranged from 358 to 457mm for the silty loam and from 406 to 462mm for the sandy loam respectively table 10 cai et al 2002 reported that the proper irrigation amount ranged from 240 to 345mm in the shihezi region of northern xinjiang lower than those in our study the differences were likely because of different climate soil texture and quality of irrigation water our results also showed that the appropriate irrigation amounts were higher for the sandy loam than the silty loam indicating that cotton growth required more water or high irrigation frequency in sandy loam because of the lower water holding capacity et ranged from 448 7 to 579 3mm for the silty loam and from 413 4 to 527 5mm for the sandy loam under the conditions of appropriate irrigation amount close to the study of yang et al 2016 reported that et ranged from 489 to 554mm with an irrigation amount of 435 591mm for 2012 2014 at the same experimental site in addition to soil texture the appropriate irrigation amount also depended on the initial swc and soil salinity it increased with the increase in initial swc while decreased with the increase in initial soil salinity implying that the relative high irrigation amount is required under high swc and low soil salinity because of a good crop growth from slight stress according to the above results a reasonable irrigation amount could provide a reference for cotton under film mulched drip irrigation in southern xinjiang and other similar regions when the status of soil water and salinity at sowing are given within the recommended ranges of appropriate irrigation amount in the two soils i e 358 457mm for silty loam and 406 462mm for sandy loam the relatively large irrigation amount could be used under high swc and low soil salinity at sowing by comparison the relatively small irrigation amount could be used under low swc and high soil salinity at sowing as for high soil salinity at sowing the irrigation could be conducted to reduce the salinity stress at certain degree 4 conclusions the data from a four year field experiment 2012 2013 2015 and 2016 on cotton were used to evaluate the performance of aquacrop under film mulched drip irrigation in an arid region of southern xinjiang china based on the recommended parameters for cotton in aquacrop manual the 2016 data sets were used to calibrate the model and the data sets for other three years were used for the process of model validation aquacrop can satisfactorily simulate the changes in cc sws in the 80 cm soil profile and aboveground biomass with r 2 0 77 and d 0 92 whereas slightly underestimate cotton yield as for soil salinity the model performed well in the treatments of irel 80 r 2 0 87 and underestimated in the treatments of irel 80 r 2 0 32 the disagreements between simulated and measured soil salinity could be due to the simplicity in calculation of the salt movement and root distribution in the model implying that the algorithms of soil salinity distribution and root development in the model require farther modification overall aquacrop can be used as a reliable tool for predicting the cotton growth responses to water under film mulched drip irrigation in this region of southern xinjiang after validation the simulations with aquacrop were carried out under various scenarios 11 irrigation amounts 3 initial swcs 5 initial salinities 2 soil textures with film mulched drip irrigation the outputs of these simulations indicated that soil texture and initial swc had important effects on et and yield consequently affecting wue following the local cropping system and irrigation frequency the seasonal irrigation amounts were recommended at 358 457mm for the silty loam and 406 462mm for the sandy loam based on the demand for high yield and wue the irrigation amount also depended on soil water and salinity at sowing specifically within the suggested range of seasonal irrigation amount the relatively large water amount could be applied under high swc and low soil salinity at sowing and the relatively small water amount could be used under low swc and high soil salinity at sowing the recommendation could provide a reference for irrigation management on cotton under film mulched drip irrigation in southern xinjiang and other similar regions the appropriate irrigation amount however also depends on planting date water quality irrigation frequency and depth of groundwater further studies are thus needed for optimizing irrigation strategies in this region acknowledgements this

11603,in many arid regions of the world population growth groundwater depletion and uncertain supplies have caused water for agricultural production to become increasingly scarce deficit irrigation di provides a potential response to water scarcity but no consensus exists on its economic viability in this paper we develop an agro economic model that connects plant growth stage specific evapotranspiration et targets with farm profitability we use the model to determine the economic conditions under which et targets of less than 100 are optimal for profit maximizing maize farmers in colorado with 2015 input costs as maize grain prices increase beyond 0 19kg 1 di can become optimal during the late vegetative growth stage but requires a water cost greater than u s 0 21m 3 under some output price and water cost combinations di in the maturation stage also becomes optimal these results suggest that producers could respond to increasing water scarcity with deficit irrigation but only in a range of water costs that depends on output price and production costs keywords deficit irrigation crop water production function agro economic model economic viability 1 introduction for agricultural producers in arid regions of the western united states water represents a major constraining resource moore et al 1994 even as competition for scarce surface water increases goodman 2000 aquifer depletion has resulted in diminished groundwater supplies mcmahon et al 2007 mcguire 2011 and higher pumping costs konikow and kendy 2005 at the same time global climate change threatens to increase temperatures and lead to more erratic precipitation patterns thus exacerbating existing shortages and negatively impacting crop production islam et al 2012 often water is transferred from agricultural production to municipal and industrial uses in order to meet the demands of growing populations in response agricultural producers who depend on irrigation have sought solutions that optimize the value obtained from increasingly limited irrigation water producers respond to water scarcity and climate change in many ways graveline and mérel 2014 including reducing irrigated area changing the crops planted connor et al 2009 adopting new technology pfeiffer and lin 2014 adjusting input use and altering the timing of planting waongo et al 2015 these options are generally associated with a decline in farm incomes due to increased costs or a reduction in the area of irrigated land with negative implications for rural livelihoods this situation has led to a surge of interest in alternatives to reducing irrigated area or returning to rainfed conditions entirely one potential alternative to drying land includes deficit irrigation di defined as applying less water than needed to satisfy full plant evapotranspiration et requirements resulting in drought stress and yield losses geerts and raes 2009 while often promoted as a response to water scarcity no consensus exists on its economic viability which depends critically on how crop growth responds to water stress in this paper we develop an agro economic model to assess the viability of di for maize producers in colorado the model uses econometrically estimated agronomic relationships to connect producer decisions about water stress at different stages of plant growth to water demands and profitability a novel experiment from a northern colorado field site limited irrigation research farm usda ars provides data to estimate a water yield production function that allows the marginal product of water applied to differ across plant growth stages we use the agro economic model to examine the economic conditions in which di becomes optimal for a maize producer in the region this approach contributes to the agricultural economics and agronomy literatures by estimating crop et production functions that allow for different marginal productivities of et in distinct plant growth stages this assumption is more consistent with agronomic evidence on the water requirements and heat sensitivity of maize across growth stages geerts and raes 2009 following antle et al 2003 we embed an econometrically estimated physical relationship within an optimization framework that accurately captures the physical relationships between producer irrigation decisions realized et crop growth and water demands we also allow for stochastic weather in general embedding econometric estimates of physical processes within an economic optimization problem provides a useful tool for evaluating the economic viability of conservation practices 1 1 water use in the agricultural economics literature the economics literature has explored optimal responses to water scarcity using a range of methods overall evidence suggests that producers respond to water scarcity by reducing the area planted changing crops grown and by applying less water per hectare for a given crop moore et al 1994 hornbeck and keskin 2014 point out that the introduction of irrigation caused producers in the american midwest to expand the total area in production graveline and mérel 2014 investigated the impacts of reduced water availability in the beauce region of france and found that producers responded in all ways mentioned above garcía vila and fereres 2012 developed a pre season economic optimization model where a farm chooses the optimal combination of crop area and seasonal applied irrigation water aiw concluding that under moderate seasonal irrigation water restrictions the optimum aiw for maize falls somewhat below the full irrigation requirement in general economic optimization models of crop planting and watering decisions require information on the net return per hectare of a set of crops as well as the relationship between water and crop growth while calibration and optimization techniques vary optimal area and irrigation decisions depend critically on the production function that relates a measure of water to crop yields the shape of the water yield relationship helps determine the optimal responses to water scarcity several options exist for obtaining production functions used in economic models one option is to assume a fixed leontief relationship between land and water use howitt 1995 while useful in estimating crop choices the assumption of fixed water use per hectare in a given crop does not allow less water to be applied per area planted to address this limitation edwards et al 1996 used more flexible production functions such as a constant elasticity of substitution function to relate production to the use of land water and other inputs critically the importance of reducing water applied per unit land depends on the assumed substitutability of land and water others have used econometric estimation to describe the relationship between water other inputs and yield for example antle et al 2003 econometrically estimated crop supplies and input use on farms in montana these demands were then integrated into an optimization framework to predict optimal land use and input choices on specific farms graveline and mérel 2014 specified production per land area as a nonlinear function of water and estimated parameters econometrically using observed water and yield information in the region of their study finally crop simulation models have allowed economists to explore yield responses to changes in water and other input use for example foster et al 2014 used the food and agricultural organization s aquacrop model to simulate the impact of soil water content targets on yield garcía vila and fereres 2012 also used aquacrop to obtain water limited yield predictions antle et al 2003 and mérel et al 2013 used the century parton et al 1994 and daycent del grosso et al 2008 ecosystem models respectively to predict relationships between input use including water crop yield and emissions often econometrically estimated curves can be fit to simulated output to generate parameterized production functions that depend on economic decision variables while helpful in showing that producers can make decisions that decrease the water applied per area of a given crop existing economic models focus on the annual volume of water as the decision variable of the producer foster et al 2014 deviated from this by modeling irrigation as a choice of soil moisture target because planned di requires a choice of et target at the beginning of an agricultural season a rigorous assessment of optimal et targets requires a model that connects a choice of et target to water use and profit 1 2 agronomic evidence on the water yield relationship a common limitation of many economic analyses of water use is that the assumed relationships are not always consistent with predicted agronomic relationships while existing literature suggests that et and water applied over a season has a roughly linear relationship to crop yield evidence suggests that the value of water differs when applied at different points throughout the agricultural season comas et al unpublished han et al unpublished stewart et al 1977 doorenbos and kasam 1986 this could mean that di during specific growth stages could be economically optimal even if it would not be optimal for an entire agricultural season in the agronomy literature there exists a debate about the exact response of yield to water and et geerts and raes 2009 develop a framework to analyze the water production function wpf of different crops and use previous literature to test the shape of this relationship for different crops with respect to maize grown in different locations geerts and raes 2009 point out that many wpfs are linear with yield declining proportionally to water used by the crop when extrapolated to zero water use many wpfs imply a negative y intercept farre and faci 2006 payero et al 2006 igbadun et al 2006 oktem et al 2003 tolk et al 1999 in a paper for the fao steduto et al 2012 describe maize as a crop with a very sensitive response to water deficits with large yield reductions when water use is reduced the same study states that when using the aquacrop model to estimate the relationship between yield and stress maize does not adjust to low water availability as well as cotton sorghum or wheat payero et al 2008 also describe the relationship between yield and et as linear while curvature may exist between yield and water applied yet others find curvilinear relationships between et and yield and suggest this indicates that maximum yield per water consumed occurs at less than full irrigation trout and dejonge 2017 however while agronomic researchers have focused on maximizing yield per unit water consumed agricultural producers are driven by economic conditions and consider both revenues and costs associated with land use and irrigation decisions recently agronomic researchers have begun to recognize that the timing of water applied plays a key role in its contribution to yield for example steduto et al 2012 state that maize may be more tolerant to water stress before the flowering stage there is evidence that the crop can partially recover from early stage drought stress resulting in relatively small yield reductions geerts and raes 2009 include a summary of previous experimental literature advocating for the use of di for example yilmaz et al 2006 recommends moderate drought stress in the early vegetative stage and after the milky grain stage in the late reproductive stage consistent with this pandey et al 2000a b recommend limited drought stress during the early vegetative stage in contrast kirda et al 1999 recommend avoiding stress during the early vegetative and flowering stages and applying deficits in the late vegetative stage prior to flowering while many have investigated producer responses to water scarcity as well as the relationship between et and maize yields to our knowledge no research has used an agro economic model to connect a decision about growth stage specific crop et to stochastic profit earned by a profit maximizing producer this involves connecting plant growth stage specific et targets to water use and crop yields this connection is necessary to model the economic viability of deficit irrigation because et targets must be represented as an economic decision in general embedding econometric estimates of physical processes within an economic optimization problem provides a useful tool for evaluating the economic viability of conservation practices 2 materials and methods 2 1 agro economic modeling framework we develop a stochastic optimization model that allows a producer s choice of et target to be plant growth stage specific this means that at the time of planting a producer can choose a differing et target for each stage the model also incorporates the agronomic realities of how producer et targets translate into realizations of et and water volumes applied we assume that at the beginning of an agricultural growing season a producer chooses the number of hectares to plant l and plant growth stage specific et targets t s 0 1 for stages s 2 4 the proportion t s is a choice for stages s 1 3 we assume t s 1 representing full irrigation this modeling choice is made to be consistent with the experimental procedure used to parameterize the model which varied et targets during the two stages in which et is modeled as a choice growth stage definitions are provided in section 2 2 yield per hectare is a function of realized et in each of the four stages while a producer chooses an et target t s for stages 2 and 4 crop production depends on realized et which is a function of t s and weather related variables let θ s be a vector of weather variables that includes precipitation ψ s and other weather variables such as radiation wind and temperature in each growth stage throughout we use the tilde to indicate that at the time of planting a variable is stochastic in the optimization model for a summary of all model parameters and variables see appendix a table a1 given this we define annual et calculated over the growth stage as 1 e t s t s θ s e t c b s t s θ s e s e t c b s t s θ s is known as basal crop et allen et al 1998 and reports et in each growth stage for a specific plant as a function of water stress determined by the et target t s and the weather that occurs in a given growth stage e t c b s t s θ s is calculated as 2 e t c b s t s θ s k c b k s e t r s θ s e t r s is the standardized reference evapotranspiration from the american society of civil engineers asce 2005 for a generic tall crop to tailor this reference et to maize it is multiplied by the basal crop coefficient for maize k cb to account for water stress in each growth stage k c b e t r s θ s is multiplied by a stress coefficient k s t s therefore k s varies based on the et target chosen for the growth stage the relationship between k s and t s is based on the assumption that the farmer is capable of achieving a specific target and by definition the stress coefficient is the ratio between the irrigation and potential evapotranspiration e s is a scaling factor that corrects for the level of wet soil evaporation that occurs during each growth stage the variable is stage specific and is estimated in this model using experimental data e s 1 scales the basal crop et to account for the additional water requirement driven by evaporative losses we account for application losses in the model by assuming an application efficiency α s t s 0 1 so that only a fraction of irrigation water applied remains in the plant root zone and the rest is lost through deep percolation and runoff the value of α s depends on the uniformity of the water application which depends on the irrigation technology used and is a function of the target et reflecting decreases in efficiency as the target approaches 1 full irrigation this assumption is motivated by reduced precipitation losses to deep percolation when et targets are lower in addition when targeting an average of 100 et at a field level some proportion of the field likely exceeds the water needed to meet 100 et as the target falls below 100 the proportion of the field receiving excess water falls note that the quantity of water applied does not enter directly into the calculation of et at this stage of the model this occurs because we express et as a function of a chosen target and not the water required to meet this target the volume of water applied depends on the target and application efficiency but plant growth is a function of e t s t s θ s given this setup for et crop yield per hectare y can be expressed as the water production function 3 y t θ f e t 1 θ 1 e t 2 t 2 θ 2 e t 3 θ 3 e t 4 t 4 θ 4 ϵ t t 1 t 2 t 3 t 4 and θ θ 1 θ 2 θ 3 θ 4 eq 3 is estimated using experimental data the impact of weather variables contained in θ s is fully captured by e t s t s θ s and thus ε 0 σ ε 2 reflects variation in production unrelated to et in an attempt to achieve an et target the producer applies a volume of costly water to each hectare the volume of water applied depends on the weather in a given year therefore water applied per hectare over a season w t θ is equal to the sum of water required to meet et targets in each of the four growth stages considering the efficiency factor α s t s therefore 4 w t θ σ s 1 4 max e t s t s θ s α s t s ψ s 0 in other words water is applied to a hectare to make up the difference between the et target in millimeters and et supplied purely through precipitation ψ s also in millimeters since it is possible that precipitation forces et to exceed the target level but irrigation cannot be negative water applied in a given stage is the maximum of zero and the difference between e t s t s θ s α s t s and the water supplied by precipitation this approach assumes that the soil contains the same amount of stored water at the beginning and end of each stage to link et targets and water use to economics we express producer profit π as a function of land planted and stage specific et targets 5 π t l θ p l y t θ r l w t θ c l the producer faces output price p cost per unit of water r and cost per unit of land planted c note that eq 5 represents a gross measure of profit because it does not account for depreciation returns to management and other operation level fixed costs given this the objective function of the producer becomes 6 max l 0 l t 2 0 1 t 4 0 1 e π t l θ e represents the expectation operator where the expectation is taken over θ s the producer s decision is constrained by the availability of land that can be irrigated therefore we include the constraint that l l where l is the land available to be irrigated in appendix b we explore the role of risk aversion in influencing producer planting and di decisions 2 2 data and context the data used to parameterize the agro economic model described in section 2 1 come from a variety of sources first the production function is parameterized using water productivity research taking place at the usda ars limited irrigation research facility lirf near greeley colorado 40 26 n 104 38 w and 1428m asl average growing season may to september precipitation at lirf is 215mm trout and bausch 2017 the predominant soil type in this region is olney fine sandy loam prices and costs come from colorado state university csu extension for the years 2010 2015 csu crop enterprise budgets 2010 2015 and the weather data come from the colorado agricultural meteorological network coagmet http www coagmet colostate edu the experimental data used to parameterize the model varied et in the late vegetative and the maturation stages of growth so we assume the producer can choose et target of less than 100 during those plant growth stages in most years planting occurred in may the early vegetative period covered emergence to late june the late vegetative stage generally falls between late june and late july the reproductive stage was approximately late july to late august while the maturation stage was approximately late august to the end of september 2 2 1 experimental data research was carried out at lirf that varied et targets across plots to examine the relationship between et and maize yield in two data sets in one data set collected from 2008 to 2011 trout and bausch 2017 each of six treatments was assigned to 4 blocks in each of four years the treatments included et targets of 1 0 no water stress 0 85 0 75 0 70 0 55 and 0 40 full irrigation occurred prior to v7 to ensure proper formation of reproductive organs water stress was partially reduced for all treatments during the reproductive vt r2 growth stages as well in each case researchers used irrigation to achieve annual et targets as accurately as possible in this dataset the et target did not vary between plant growth stages 2 and 4 though realized et did change from stage to stage the second dataset contains produced yield data from 2012 2013 and 2015 the 2014 crop year is omitted because of weather conditions during germination that reduced plant populations below normal commercial levels for this dataset the irrigation treatment varied by crop growth stage allowing the separate identification of the impact of et targets in stages 2 and 4 in stages 2 and 4 targets independently took the value of 1 0 0 80 0 65 0 50 and 0 40 for a total of 12 treatments in all cases the et target was 1 0 in stages 1 and 3 each treatment was randomly assigned to four blocks for a total of 48 plots yield data were available by plot for all years with experimental data in 2008 2011 as well as 2015 et was determined at the treatment level and in this case we assume that et was equal across all plots within a treatment et was determined with similar methods in the 2012 and 2013 dataset for individual plots et determined at the treatment level was generally within the standard error of the average et among the four individual plots for these two years verifying that et determined at the treatment level was appropriate daily values of k cb were obtained from the usda ars water management and systems research unit finally estimates of daily soil evaporation were calculated using methods described in trout and bausch 2017 2 2 2 economic data economic data including prices and costs come from csu extension we use the estimated production costs and returns for irrigated corn in northeastern colorado csu crop enterprise budget for all available years 2010 2015 2 2 3 weather data in order to solve the stochastic optimization problem we create a distribution of annual weather using data from the coagmet weather station gly 04 on site and the nearby station lcn01 lucerne due to gaps in historical data from gly 04 we use the lucerne station to supplement and complete the dataset for a more complete historical weather record this historical data allows us to better characterize the distribution of stochastic weather variables across years lucerne provides information for the years between 1992 and 2009 when data were not available from gly 04 relevant variables available hourly include mean temperature vapor pressure solar radiation and wind speed in the experiment the start and end date for each crop growth stage varies from year to year to parameterize the model we use the lirf experiment average date for planting and the transition dates between stages are determined using the average number of growing degree days needed for maize to reach each growth stage 2 3 agro economic model parameterization model parameterization consists of combining experimental data weather data and economic data described in the previous section to place functional forms and values in five main agronomic and physical components of the model 1 the yield production function 2 reference et from hourly weather information e t r s θ s 3 k cb based on daily observed values 4 k s from stress target t s and finally 5 evaporation for each stage e s in combination this provides an estimate of et s described in eq 1 these agronomic and physical relationships are then embedded into a profit maximization problem 2 3 1 production function estimation to flexibly estimate the relationship between realized et and yield we specify a cobb douglas production function since lirf experimental data exist at the plot and year level observations are over plot i and year t therefore the relationship between observed yield and et eq 3 takes the following form 7 ln y i t β 0 β 1 l n e t 1 i t β 2 l n e t 2 i t β 3 l n e t 3 i t β 4 l n e t 4 i t ϵ i t where β 0 β 1 β 2 β 3 and β 4 are parameters to be estimated using ordinary least squares regression our econometric results table 1 demonstrate that the coefficients β 0 β 2 β 3 and β 4 are positive and statistically significant at the 1 level while β 1 is not statistically significant at a confidence level of 10 table 1 column 1 despite a lack of significance we do not omit β 1 from the predicted yield function used in the producer optimization problem also note that the magnitude of coefficients does not vary substantially when only the most recent experimental data are used for estimation column 2 includes only experimental years that have within season variation in et target though when 2015 data are omitted column 3 β 2 and β 3 are a smaller magnitude and are estimated with less precision 2015 had pest problems that affected all treatments since the possibility of pest infestation affects producer decisions our preferred specification column 1 includes data from all experiment years fig 1 presents the relationship between stage specific et and yield implied by the estimated parameters using all years of data in a 3 d plot with yield on the vertical axis and evapotranspiration in the second and fourth stages the stages in which that the farmer can choose di on the x and y axes note that as et increases in stages 2 and 4 the additional yield from increased et falls this decreasing marginal productivity is required for di to be optimal under any circumstances we now turn to the estimation of the relationships needed to estimate e t s t s θ s which is composed of basal crop et e t c b s t s θ s k c b k s e t r s θ s and evaporation e s therefore we describe the process used to obtain the three parts of e t c b s t s θ s as well as e s 2 3 2 calculation of reference et e t r s θ s we use hourly weather data and the standardized penman monteith equation to calculate reference et on an hourly basis hourly reference et is then summed by day to create daily estimates of reference et this daily variable is combined with daily estimates of k cb and summed within a growth stage to generate stage specific et 2 3 3 estimation of basal crop coefficient kcb next we estimate k cb which adjusts reference et levels to a specific crop maize k cb is defined as the ratio of the crop evapotranspiration to the reference evapotranspiration allen et al 1998 the challenge with estimating k cb is that its daily value varies over the agricultural growing season and the accumulated number of growing degree days d therefore we use data from lirf to estimate the relationship between daily k cb d and the accumulated number of growing degree days gdds for maize from full irrigation treatments from 2008 to 2013 producing a total of 1076 observations and a bell shaped function fig 2 gdd is a measure of heat accumulation used to predict plant development through the stages and the calculation used here is based on the methodology in jensen and allen 2016 using ordinary least squares regression we estimate the parameters of a polynomial including growing degree days up to the fifth power of a polynomial fitted curve fig 2 the parameters are significant at the 5 level on growing degree days to the powers 0 3 the r squared of this regression is 0 86 in the model we use the predicted value for k cb but introduce the constraint that k c b d 12 1 05 predicted daily values of k cb d are multiplied by daily reference et and summed by plant growth stage to generate stage specific estimates of k c b k s e t r s θ s the number of accumulated gdd defining the transition from one stage to the next are calculated as the average for the full irrigation treatments from 2008 to 2013 the transition from stage 1 to stage 2 occurs after 389 gdds from stage 2 3 after 792 cumulative gdds from stage 3 4 after 1089 cumulative gdds and stage 4 finishes after 1376 cumulative gdds 2 3 4 stress coefficient k s to obtain the last component of et cb s the daily value for stress coefficient k s k s d is defined as the target set for each of the four stages e g k 2 would be 0 4 for a target of 0 40 in stage two in our model and based on the experiment at lirf we allow stress to occur in the second and fourth stage while for the first and third stages there is no deficit irrigation target corresponding to k 1 k 3 1 the stress coefficient k s is then multiplied by k c b e t r s θ s to obtain estimated e t c b s t s θ s for the years 1992 2015 2 3 5 estimation of evaporation e s to calculate e t s t s θ s from e t c b s t s θ s we must estimate evaporation e s we estimate the evaporation scaling factor in each growth stage by averaging stage specific evaporation estimates from 2008 to 2011 based on this calculation the values for e s are the following 1 61233 1 0525 1 02043 and 1 09722 for stages 1 2 3 and 4 respectively these values reflect expected responses in which evaporation is high relative to et cb s in stage 1 when the plants are small low in stages 2 and 3 when et cb s is high and the soil is shaded by the crop canopy and moderate in stage 4 as the canopy begins to senesce 2 3 6 economic parameters we evaluate the economic optimality of di under a range of economic parameters in all cases we assume that available land is 52 6ha representing the area most commonly irrigated by a center pivot irrigation system the price of maize grain and per hectare costs are obtained from csu crop enterprise budgets for the years 2010 2015 csu crop enterprise budgets 2010 2015 per hectare costs include the direct costs operating preharvest operating harvest and property and ownership costs and exclude land rental payments since the opportunity cost of water for a given producer is not known we identify the range of water costs in which di becomes optimal by solving the agro economic model for costs from 0 to 0 38m 3 conditional on 2015 input cost and output price this range spans the potential opportunity costs of water seen in the region of study for example the 2011 cost and return study for irrigated corn silage csu extension 2011 suggests that the financial cost of pumping groundwater is 0 019m 3 producers likely also consider the opportunity cost of water used for irrigating in the colorado big thompson c bt regional pool lease prices reached an average of 0 076m 3 adding electricity costs to this produces a unit water cost of 0 095m 3 finally anecdotal evidence suggests that municipalities have leased water for more than 0 30m 3 after demonstrating how et targets depend on output prices and input costs we parameterize the costs and prices from estimated production costs and returns for irrigated corn in northeastern colorado for all available years 2010 2015 to explore optimal decisions under realized economic conditions in practice the price of inputs is correlated with the price of the commodity zulauf 2016 so we consider costs and price from the same year when examining the optimality of di we specify irrigation efficiency as a linear function that varies with the target to parametrize the equation we assume irrigation efficiency of 75 when fully irrigating the crop and of 100 when the target stress level is at 0 50 recall that soil evaporation losses are considered separately in the es component 2 3 7 solution method and policy scenarios to solve the stochastic problem for optimal et targets t 2 and t 4 we begin by calculating how much water the producer would have used eq 4 and how much yield the producer would have obtained eq 3 for every year between 1992 and 2015 conditional on choices for the et targets and planted area l we then calculate the profit for each year again as a function of et target and l finally we calculate expected profit by averaging profit across each historical weather year from 1992 to 2015 still conditional on a choice of t 2 t 4 and l we assume an equal probability for each year to be replicated garcía vila and fereres 2012 this historical weather distribution represents the information that a producer uses to inform beliefs about the distribution of weather realizations faced at the beginning of a planting season finally a nonlinear solver chooses t 2 t 4 and l to maximize expected profit subject to the land availability constraint 3 results the model is solved under a wide range of maize grain prices and water costs while holding per hectare costs constant to assess the conditions under which di becomes optimal we then show how the cost of water affects planting decisions and et targets holding all else equal finally we demonstrate the water cost ranges in which di becomes optimal given observed historical combinations of per hectare costs and prices for a maize producer in colorado in practice water costs could increase as irrigation districts impose fees to cover increased costs to acquire and deliver water or as energy costs increase to pump water the market value of water will also likely continue to increase as population growth in water scarce regions raises municipal and industrial willingness to pay for water there may also be an increase in environmental values of water as this occurs a producer may realize an increased opportunity cost of water used on the farm the results presented here are qualitatively robust to the choice of data to estimate production function parameters seen in table 1 since production function parameters differ slightly depending on which years are included expected profit varies but water use conditional on et target does not vary because it depends only on the difference between et targets and precipitation the precise prices and costs at which di becomes optimal vary slightly but the qualitative patterns hold across estimated production function parameters fig 3 shows the ranges of water costs and crop prices for which di et target less than 1 provides higher profits than full irrigation et target equal to 1 the grey line shows the combination of prices above which the profit from producing falls to zero profits are maximized for cost combinations above this line by not planting the crop i e fallowing the land the line slopes upward because as the crop price increases production remains profitable at higher water costs the two black lines below the grey line in fig 3 show the range of crop and water prices for which di in stage 2 or 4 becomes profitable cost combinations between the black and grey lines represent conditions for which di provides maximum profits cost combinations below the black lines represent conditions for which full irrigation maximizes profits the level of deficit irrigation reduction in et target that maximizes profit increases for a given crop price as the water price increases the grey upper boundary of the cost combinations within which di is optimal represent the maximum di minimum et target that produces positive profits fig 3 demonstrates that the minimum value of water to incentivize di increases with maize grain price with a lower minimum water cost required to implement di in plant growth stage 2 than in stage 4 the x axis of fig 3 presents the output price per kilogram holding input costs constant at 2015 levels the qualitative results hold for per hectare costs from any of the available years notice that di is never optimal at the realized 2015 price of 0 146kg 1 represented with a vertical line in fig 3 and that no crop should be grown for water costs above 0 1m3 because production plus water costs exceed crop revenue when the stage 2 di curve falls below the curve describing the water cost at which planted hectares goes to zero there exists a water cost at which di becomes optimal in stage 2 fig 3 for example for an output price above 0 19kg 1 it is optimal to implement di for all water costs above the solid black curve and below the grey curve at which planting does not occur similarly at a price above 0 25kg 1 it is optimal to implement di in both stages 2 and 4 for water costs above dashed black curve and below the grey curve a few key results emerge from fig 3 first for 2015 production costs at water costs below 0 21m 3 it is never optimal to implement di next the maize price must reach 0 19kg 1 before di can be optimal under any water cost intuitively the higher the output price the higher the minimum water cost required for di to occur in a given stage this makes sense because a higher output price means that the value marginal product of et increases for a given increase in physical yield as the value marginal product of et increases it becomes optimal to increase the target if not already at 100 finally as the maize price increases the range of water cost within which di becomes optimal increases as seen by the increased distance between the solid black and grey curves as the price increases another important result emerging from fig 3 is that there is no optimal adjustment in the quantity of land planted the planted land falls directly from the total available land to zero as the cost of water increases this occurs because of the assumption of risk neutrality and a uniform water production function for all available land see appendix b for an analysis of the impact of risk aversion on planting and di decisions while fig 3 allows output prices to vary fig 4 presents an example of how optimal et targets depend on water cost using 2012 prices it becomes apparent that in 2012 di became optimal in stage 2 with water costs between 0 292 and 0 378 m 3 when planting no longer occurs since output price and input costs can move together in practice zulauf 2016 we now examine the range of water costs in which di becomes optimal using realized price and cost data from 2010 to 2015 we assume that a producer knows both input and output prices as of planting e g through futures contracts and makes a decision about stage specific et targets given the prices and costs in each of the six years from 2010 to 2015 table 2 presents the prices and per hectare costs for each year and then notes the minimum water cost at which di would have occurred in stages 2 and 4 in 2010 2012 a high water cost could have made di optimal in stage 2 but it is never optimal in 2013 2015 this can be explained by the relatively high maize price experienced in 2010 2012 consistent with fig 3 di can only be optimal once the price exceeds a given threshold the exact threshold depends on per hectare input costs this threshold has not been passed since the maize price fell in 2013 interestingly when commodity prices spiked in 2012 if water became extremely expensive above 0 376m 3 it would have been optimal to implement di in both stage 2 and stage 4 taken together these results suggest that di can become optimal with relative high maize and water costs suggesting that it could be an optimal strategy for responding to increasingly scarce water resources 4 discussion our results suggest that if di is to be used with maize it should be done first in the late vegetative stage and only within a range of water cost the width of this range depends on the output price of maize as well as per hectare production costs di in the maturation grain filling stage requires even higher water costs the results presented here also suggest that efforts to conserve water through di require water prices that likely exceed historical levels in the us high plains in addition the output price of maize must be relatively high compared to input costs for di to be optimal at any water cost even using the lowest per hectare input costs in the years considered 2010 the minimum water cost for di is 0 19m 3with output price at 0 175kg 1 for comparison according to northern colorado water conservancy district the weighted average price paid for water in the colorado big thompson regional pool increased from 0 047m 3 in march of 2016 to 0 076m 3 in march 2017 jon altenhofen personal communication irrigation districts in the san luis valley of colorado charge the highest water fee in the state equal to just 0 06m 3 while current published water costs do not make di optimal anecdotal evidence suggests that oil and gas firms as well as municipalities are beginning to lease water at rates that could incentivize di prices paid for water are in the range of 0 04 to 0 81m 3 with maize grain prices sufficiently high this range includes water costs that would make di optimal but the wide range in observed water costs makes it challenging to predict the appropriate opportunity cost of water for a given producer long term water lease options currently promoted by the colorado water conservation board will enable contracted opportunity costs for irrigation water therefore depending on the opportunity cost of water used for irrigation some producers in the region may be able to gain by choosing et targets of less than 100 comparing water costs across the world there exist some regions of the world where water would be sufficiently scarce to make di optimal though water yield functions may differ in these regions as well for example in the southern murray darling basin in australia water prices were almost 0 15m 3in 2015 and prices in parts of israel were 0 61m 3 as of may 2017 while useful the model presented here has several shortcomings that should be considered in future work for example we assume a static model in which producers choose stage specific et targets at the time of planting in reality a producer can choose initial et targets and adjust them throughout the season based on realized weather and the ability to achieve specified targets next we have assumed a uniform water production function in reality producers often have access to land of varying yield potential when this is the case it could be optimal to remove low quality land from production before doing di on highly productive fields our model does not allow for this possibility another limitation of the model as parameterized here is that we do not allow other inputs and thus costs to vary as et targets vary for example fertilizer or seed requirements may decrease when et and yield targets are reduced reducing water applied may also increase other production costs such as weed and insect control finally we assume that the production function parameters do not vary across years in practice the relationship between et and yield in a given stage could depend on factors not modeled here future research should analyze di within a context of other water conservation options including crop selection and other management strategies such as tillage for example changing planting dates and the timing of irrigation could influence the costs and benefits associated with di also producers may choose to reduce preseason irrigation which can be an inefficient use of water rogers and lamm 1994 while we hold the crop choice fixed maize producers in practice may choose to switch to less water intensive irrigated crops as an alternative to returning to rainfed production thus future research should consider multiple crops as well as the choice of et target per crop a final avenue for future research includes the optimal allocation of a fixed but stochastic water supply 5 conclusion in this paper we develop a stochastic agro economic model of maize production in which a producer chooses plant growth stage specific et targets we examine the conditions in which a producer would optimally implement di and find that for the per hectare cost observed in 2015 di can become economically optimal for maize when maize grain prices reach 0 19kg 1 and water costs exceed 0 21m 3 we test what would have been the optimal et targets for the observed costs and prices in colorado to increasing water costs for the years 2010 2015 and observe that di would have been optimal at water costs above 0 23 0 29m 3 in 2010 2012 years with high maize grain prices the optimality of di holds within a range of water costs whose span depends on the relationship between output price and per hectare costs excluding water costs water costs beyond this range cause a producer to stop planting finally we showed that the risk neutral producer always plants all available land if it is profitable to plant at all the agro economic model developed here integrates agronomic research with economic optimization to provide a framework for evaluating the economic viability of a strategy for responding to increasingly scarce water resources while the focus of this study is on the optimality of di for maize producers the use of econometric procedures to estimate agronomic relationships can provide ex ante information to evaluate a wide range of strategies proposed by agronomists researchers policymakers and producers in a context of increasingly scarce land and water resources this approach to investigating economic viability while accounting for agronomic realities can inform policymakers and provide direction on cost effective strategies for resource conservation acknowledgements thanks to the csu water center for funding this research we also thank the usda ars water management unit for providing the experimental data used to parameterize this model appendix a appendix b risk aversion a2 1 risk aversion to account for risk aversion we specify a constant relative risk aversion utility function over profit with a wealth base of 150 000 with this value we ensure that total consumption for the household is positive even in scenarios when the farm s realized profit is negative with relative risk aversion γ the producer s utility function becomes a2 1 u π π 150 000 1 γ 1 γ γ where positive negative values indicate risk averse seeking behavior when γ 0 the agent is risk neutral and maximizes expected profit to allow for risk aversion we assume γ 2 but optimal et targets vary little with values of γ between 10 and 10 covering a range of relatively risk loving and risk averse decision makers given this the objective function of the producer becomes a2 2 max l 0 l t 2 0 1 t 4 0 1 e u π t l θ results table a2 shows that the inclusion of risk aversion in the model results in a range of water cost within which a producer would plant less than all available land instead of a decrease directly to zero as in the profit maximization model this occurs as a risk averse producer reduces land planted and expected profit in order to reduce the variance in profit as well this behavior occurs because of the strict concavity of u in the optimization model 
11603,in many arid regions of the world population growth groundwater depletion and uncertain supplies have caused water for agricultural production to become increasingly scarce deficit irrigation di provides a potential response to water scarcity but no consensus exists on its economic viability in this paper we develop an agro economic model that connects plant growth stage specific evapotranspiration et targets with farm profitability we use the model to determine the economic conditions under which et targets of less than 100 are optimal for profit maximizing maize farmers in colorado with 2015 input costs as maize grain prices increase beyond 0 19kg 1 di can become optimal during the late vegetative growth stage but requires a water cost greater than u s 0 21m 3 under some output price and water cost combinations di in the maturation stage also becomes optimal these results suggest that producers could respond to increasing water scarcity with deficit irrigation but only in a range of water costs that depends on output price and production costs keywords deficit irrigation crop water production function agro economic model economic viability 1 introduction for agricultural producers in arid regions of the western united states water represents a major constraining resource moore et al 1994 even as competition for scarce surface water increases goodman 2000 aquifer depletion has resulted in diminished groundwater supplies mcmahon et al 2007 mcguire 2011 and higher pumping costs konikow and kendy 2005 at the same time global climate change threatens to increase temperatures and lead to more erratic precipitation patterns thus exacerbating existing shortages and negatively impacting crop production islam et al 2012 often water is transferred from agricultural production to municipal and industrial uses in order to meet the demands of growing populations in response agricultural producers who depend on irrigation have sought solutions that optimize the value obtained from increasingly limited irrigation water producers respond to water scarcity and climate change in many ways graveline and mérel 2014 including reducing irrigated area changing the crops planted connor et al 2009 adopting new technology pfeiffer and lin 2014 adjusting input use and altering the timing of planting waongo et al 2015 these options are generally associated with a decline in farm incomes due to increased costs or a reduction in the area of irrigated land with negative implications for rural livelihoods this situation has led to a surge of interest in alternatives to reducing irrigated area or returning to rainfed conditions entirely one potential alternative to drying land includes deficit irrigation di defined as applying less water than needed to satisfy full plant evapotranspiration et requirements resulting in drought stress and yield losses geerts and raes 2009 while often promoted as a response to water scarcity no consensus exists on its economic viability which depends critically on how crop growth responds to water stress in this paper we develop an agro economic model to assess the viability of di for maize producers in colorado the model uses econometrically estimated agronomic relationships to connect producer decisions about water stress at different stages of plant growth to water demands and profitability a novel experiment from a northern colorado field site limited irrigation research farm usda ars provides data to estimate a water yield production function that allows the marginal product of water applied to differ across plant growth stages we use the agro economic model to examine the economic conditions in which di becomes optimal for a maize producer in the region this approach contributes to the agricultural economics and agronomy literatures by estimating crop et production functions that allow for different marginal productivities of et in distinct plant growth stages this assumption is more consistent with agronomic evidence on the water requirements and heat sensitivity of maize across growth stages geerts and raes 2009 following antle et al 2003 we embed an econometrically estimated physical relationship within an optimization framework that accurately captures the physical relationships between producer irrigation decisions realized et crop growth and water demands we also allow for stochastic weather in general embedding econometric estimates of physical processes within an economic optimization problem provides a useful tool for evaluating the economic viability of conservation practices 1 1 water use in the agricultural economics literature the economics literature has explored optimal responses to water scarcity using a range of methods overall evidence suggests that producers respond to water scarcity by reducing the area planted changing crops grown and by applying less water per hectare for a given crop moore et al 1994 hornbeck and keskin 2014 point out that the introduction of irrigation caused producers in the american midwest to expand the total area in production graveline and mérel 2014 investigated the impacts of reduced water availability in the beauce region of france and found that producers responded in all ways mentioned above garcía vila and fereres 2012 developed a pre season economic optimization model where a farm chooses the optimal combination of crop area and seasonal applied irrigation water aiw concluding that under moderate seasonal irrigation water restrictions the optimum aiw for maize falls somewhat below the full irrigation requirement in general economic optimization models of crop planting and watering decisions require information on the net return per hectare of a set of crops as well as the relationship between water and crop growth while calibration and optimization techniques vary optimal area and irrigation decisions depend critically on the production function that relates a measure of water to crop yields the shape of the water yield relationship helps determine the optimal responses to water scarcity several options exist for obtaining production functions used in economic models one option is to assume a fixed leontief relationship between land and water use howitt 1995 while useful in estimating crop choices the assumption of fixed water use per hectare in a given crop does not allow less water to be applied per area planted to address this limitation edwards et al 1996 used more flexible production functions such as a constant elasticity of substitution function to relate production to the use of land water and other inputs critically the importance of reducing water applied per unit land depends on the assumed substitutability of land and water others have used econometric estimation to describe the relationship between water other inputs and yield for example antle et al 2003 econometrically estimated crop supplies and input use on farms in montana these demands were then integrated into an optimization framework to predict optimal land use and input choices on specific farms graveline and mérel 2014 specified production per land area as a nonlinear function of water and estimated parameters econometrically using observed water and yield information in the region of their study finally crop simulation models have allowed economists to explore yield responses to changes in water and other input use for example foster et al 2014 used the food and agricultural organization s aquacrop model to simulate the impact of soil water content targets on yield garcía vila and fereres 2012 also used aquacrop to obtain water limited yield predictions antle et al 2003 and mérel et al 2013 used the century parton et al 1994 and daycent del grosso et al 2008 ecosystem models respectively to predict relationships between input use including water crop yield and emissions often econometrically estimated curves can be fit to simulated output to generate parameterized production functions that depend on economic decision variables while helpful in showing that producers can make decisions that decrease the water applied per area of a given crop existing economic models focus on the annual volume of water as the decision variable of the producer foster et al 2014 deviated from this by modeling irrigation as a choice of soil moisture target because planned di requires a choice of et target at the beginning of an agricultural season a rigorous assessment of optimal et targets requires a model that connects a choice of et target to water use and profit 1 2 agronomic evidence on the water yield relationship a common limitation of many economic analyses of water use is that the assumed relationships are not always consistent with predicted agronomic relationships while existing literature suggests that et and water applied over a season has a roughly linear relationship to crop yield evidence suggests that the value of water differs when applied at different points throughout the agricultural season comas et al unpublished han et al unpublished stewart et al 1977 doorenbos and kasam 1986 this could mean that di during specific growth stages could be economically optimal even if it would not be optimal for an entire agricultural season in the agronomy literature there exists a debate about the exact response of yield to water and et geerts and raes 2009 develop a framework to analyze the water production function wpf of different crops and use previous literature to test the shape of this relationship for different crops with respect to maize grown in different locations geerts and raes 2009 point out that many wpfs are linear with yield declining proportionally to water used by the crop when extrapolated to zero water use many wpfs imply a negative y intercept farre and faci 2006 payero et al 2006 igbadun et al 2006 oktem et al 2003 tolk et al 1999 in a paper for the fao steduto et al 2012 describe maize as a crop with a very sensitive response to water deficits with large yield reductions when water use is reduced the same study states that when using the aquacrop model to estimate the relationship between yield and stress maize does not adjust to low water availability as well as cotton sorghum or wheat payero et al 2008 also describe the relationship between yield and et as linear while curvature may exist between yield and water applied yet others find curvilinear relationships between et and yield and suggest this indicates that maximum yield per water consumed occurs at less than full irrigation trout and dejonge 2017 however while agronomic researchers have focused on maximizing yield per unit water consumed agricultural producers are driven by economic conditions and consider both revenues and costs associated with land use and irrigation decisions recently agronomic researchers have begun to recognize that the timing of water applied plays a key role in its contribution to yield for example steduto et al 2012 state that maize may be more tolerant to water stress before the flowering stage there is evidence that the crop can partially recover from early stage drought stress resulting in relatively small yield reductions geerts and raes 2009 include a summary of previous experimental literature advocating for the use of di for example yilmaz et al 2006 recommends moderate drought stress in the early vegetative stage and after the milky grain stage in the late reproductive stage consistent with this pandey et al 2000a b recommend limited drought stress during the early vegetative stage in contrast kirda et al 1999 recommend avoiding stress during the early vegetative and flowering stages and applying deficits in the late vegetative stage prior to flowering while many have investigated producer responses to water scarcity as well as the relationship between et and maize yields to our knowledge no research has used an agro economic model to connect a decision about growth stage specific crop et to stochastic profit earned by a profit maximizing producer this involves connecting plant growth stage specific et targets to water use and crop yields this connection is necessary to model the economic viability of deficit irrigation because et targets must be represented as an economic decision in general embedding econometric estimates of physical processes within an economic optimization problem provides a useful tool for evaluating the economic viability of conservation practices 2 materials and methods 2 1 agro economic modeling framework we develop a stochastic optimization model that allows a producer s choice of et target to be plant growth stage specific this means that at the time of planting a producer can choose a differing et target for each stage the model also incorporates the agronomic realities of how producer et targets translate into realizations of et and water volumes applied we assume that at the beginning of an agricultural growing season a producer chooses the number of hectares to plant l and plant growth stage specific et targets t s 0 1 for stages s 2 4 the proportion t s is a choice for stages s 1 3 we assume t s 1 representing full irrigation this modeling choice is made to be consistent with the experimental procedure used to parameterize the model which varied et targets during the two stages in which et is modeled as a choice growth stage definitions are provided in section 2 2 yield per hectare is a function of realized et in each of the four stages while a producer chooses an et target t s for stages 2 and 4 crop production depends on realized et which is a function of t s and weather related variables let θ s be a vector of weather variables that includes precipitation ψ s and other weather variables such as radiation wind and temperature in each growth stage throughout we use the tilde to indicate that at the time of planting a variable is stochastic in the optimization model for a summary of all model parameters and variables see appendix a table a1 given this we define annual et calculated over the growth stage as 1 e t s t s θ s e t c b s t s θ s e s e t c b s t s θ s is known as basal crop et allen et al 1998 and reports et in each growth stage for a specific plant as a function of water stress determined by the et target t s and the weather that occurs in a given growth stage e t c b s t s θ s is calculated as 2 e t c b s t s θ s k c b k s e t r s θ s e t r s is the standardized reference evapotranspiration from the american society of civil engineers asce 2005 for a generic tall crop to tailor this reference et to maize it is multiplied by the basal crop coefficient for maize k cb to account for water stress in each growth stage k c b e t r s θ s is multiplied by a stress coefficient k s t s therefore k s varies based on the et target chosen for the growth stage the relationship between k s and t s is based on the assumption that the farmer is capable of achieving a specific target and by definition the stress coefficient is the ratio between the irrigation and potential evapotranspiration e s is a scaling factor that corrects for the level of wet soil evaporation that occurs during each growth stage the variable is stage specific and is estimated in this model using experimental data e s 1 scales the basal crop et to account for the additional water requirement driven by evaporative losses we account for application losses in the model by assuming an application efficiency α s t s 0 1 so that only a fraction of irrigation water applied remains in the plant root zone and the rest is lost through deep percolation and runoff the value of α s depends on the uniformity of the water application which depends on the irrigation technology used and is a function of the target et reflecting decreases in efficiency as the target approaches 1 full irrigation this assumption is motivated by reduced precipitation losses to deep percolation when et targets are lower in addition when targeting an average of 100 et at a field level some proportion of the field likely exceeds the water needed to meet 100 et as the target falls below 100 the proportion of the field receiving excess water falls note that the quantity of water applied does not enter directly into the calculation of et at this stage of the model this occurs because we express et as a function of a chosen target and not the water required to meet this target the volume of water applied depends on the target and application efficiency but plant growth is a function of e t s t s θ s given this setup for et crop yield per hectare y can be expressed as the water production function 3 y t θ f e t 1 θ 1 e t 2 t 2 θ 2 e t 3 θ 3 e t 4 t 4 θ 4 ϵ t t 1 t 2 t 3 t 4 and θ θ 1 θ 2 θ 3 θ 4 eq 3 is estimated using experimental data the impact of weather variables contained in θ s is fully captured by e t s t s θ s and thus ε 0 σ ε 2 reflects variation in production unrelated to et in an attempt to achieve an et target the producer applies a volume of costly water to each hectare the volume of water applied depends on the weather in a given year therefore water applied per hectare over a season w t θ is equal to the sum of water required to meet et targets in each of the four growth stages considering the efficiency factor α s t s therefore 4 w t θ σ s 1 4 max e t s t s θ s α s t s ψ s 0 in other words water is applied to a hectare to make up the difference between the et target in millimeters and et supplied purely through precipitation ψ s also in millimeters since it is possible that precipitation forces et to exceed the target level but irrigation cannot be negative water applied in a given stage is the maximum of zero and the difference between e t s t s θ s α s t s and the water supplied by precipitation this approach assumes that the soil contains the same amount of stored water at the beginning and end of each stage to link et targets and water use to economics we express producer profit π as a function of land planted and stage specific et targets 5 π t l θ p l y t θ r l w t θ c l the producer faces output price p cost per unit of water r and cost per unit of land planted c note that eq 5 represents a gross measure of profit because it does not account for depreciation returns to management and other operation level fixed costs given this the objective function of the producer becomes 6 max l 0 l t 2 0 1 t 4 0 1 e π t l θ e represents the expectation operator where the expectation is taken over θ s the producer s decision is constrained by the availability of land that can be irrigated therefore we include the constraint that l l where l is the land available to be irrigated in appendix b we explore the role of risk aversion in influencing producer planting and di decisions 2 2 data and context the data used to parameterize the agro economic model described in section 2 1 come from a variety of sources first the production function is parameterized using water productivity research taking place at the usda ars limited irrigation research facility lirf near greeley colorado 40 26 n 104 38 w and 1428m asl average growing season may to september precipitation at lirf is 215mm trout and bausch 2017 the predominant soil type in this region is olney fine sandy loam prices and costs come from colorado state university csu extension for the years 2010 2015 csu crop enterprise budgets 2010 2015 and the weather data come from the colorado agricultural meteorological network coagmet http www coagmet colostate edu the experimental data used to parameterize the model varied et in the late vegetative and the maturation stages of growth so we assume the producer can choose et target of less than 100 during those plant growth stages in most years planting occurred in may the early vegetative period covered emergence to late june the late vegetative stage generally falls between late june and late july the reproductive stage was approximately late july to late august while the maturation stage was approximately late august to the end of september 2 2 1 experimental data research was carried out at lirf that varied et targets across plots to examine the relationship between et and maize yield in two data sets in one data set collected from 2008 to 2011 trout and bausch 2017 each of six treatments was assigned to 4 blocks in each of four years the treatments included et targets of 1 0 no water stress 0 85 0 75 0 70 0 55 and 0 40 full irrigation occurred prior to v7 to ensure proper formation of reproductive organs water stress was partially reduced for all treatments during the reproductive vt r2 growth stages as well in each case researchers used irrigation to achieve annual et targets as accurately as possible in this dataset the et target did not vary between plant growth stages 2 and 4 though realized et did change from stage to stage the second dataset contains produced yield data from 2012 2013 and 2015 the 2014 crop year is omitted because of weather conditions during germination that reduced plant populations below normal commercial levels for this dataset the irrigation treatment varied by crop growth stage allowing the separate identification of the impact of et targets in stages 2 and 4 in stages 2 and 4 targets independently took the value of 1 0 0 80 0 65 0 50 and 0 40 for a total of 12 treatments in all cases the et target was 1 0 in stages 1 and 3 each treatment was randomly assigned to four blocks for a total of 48 plots yield data were available by plot for all years with experimental data in 2008 2011 as well as 2015 et was determined at the treatment level and in this case we assume that et was equal across all plots within a treatment et was determined with similar methods in the 2012 and 2013 dataset for individual plots et determined at the treatment level was generally within the standard error of the average et among the four individual plots for these two years verifying that et determined at the treatment level was appropriate daily values of k cb were obtained from the usda ars water management and systems research unit finally estimates of daily soil evaporation were calculated using methods described in trout and bausch 2017 2 2 2 economic data economic data including prices and costs come from csu extension we use the estimated production costs and returns for irrigated corn in northeastern colorado csu crop enterprise budget for all available years 2010 2015 2 2 3 weather data in order to solve the stochastic optimization problem we create a distribution of annual weather using data from the coagmet weather station gly 04 on site and the nearby station lcn01 lucerne due to gaps in historical data from gly 04 we use the lucerne station to supplement and complete the dataset for a more complete historical weather record this historical data allows us to better characterize the distribution of stochastic weather variables across years lucerne provides information for the years between 1992 and 2009 when data were not available from gly 04 relevant variables available hourly include mean temperature vapor pressure solar radiation and wind speed in the experiment the start and end date for each crop growth stage varies from year to year to parameterize the model we use the lirf experiment average date for planting and the transition dates between stages are determined using the average number of growing degree days needed for maize to reach each growth stage 2 3 agro economic model parameterization model parameterization consists of combining experimental data weather data and economic data described in the previous section to place functional forms and values in five main agronomic and physical components of the model 1 the yield production function 2 reference et from hourly weather information e t r s θ s 3 k cb based on daily observed values 4 k s from stress target t s and finally 5 evaporation for each stage e s in combination this provides an estimate of et s described in eq 1 these agronomic and physical relationships are then embedded into a profit maximization problem 2 3 1 production function estimation to flexibly estimate the relationship between realized et and yield we specify a cobb douglas production function since lirf experimental data exist at the plot and year level observations are over plot i and year t therefore the relationship between observed yield and et eq 3 takes the following form 7 ln y i t β 0 β 1 l n e t 1 i t β 2 l n e t 2 i t β 3 l n e t 3 i t β 4 l n e t 4 i t ϵ i t where β 0 β 1 β 2 β 3 and β 4 are parameters to be estimated using ordinary least squares regression our econometric results table 1 demonstrate that the coefficients β 0 β 2 β 3 and β 4 are positive and statistically significant at the 1 level while β 1 is not statistically significant at a confidence level of 10 table 1 column 1 despite a lack of significance we do not omit β 1 from the predicted yield function used in the producer optimization problem also note that the magnitude of coefficients does not vary substantially when only the most recent experimental data are used for estimation column 2 includes only experimental years that have within season variation in et target though when 2015 data are omitted column 3 β 2 and β 3 are a smaller magnitude and are estimated with less precision 2015 had pest problems that affected all treatments since the possibility of pest infestation affects producer decisions our preferred specification column 1 includes data from all experiment years fig 1 presents the relationship between stage specific et and yield implied by the estimated parameters using all years of data in a 3 d plot with yield on the vertical axis and evapotranspiration in the second and fourth stages the stages in which that the farmer can choose di on the x and y axes note that as et increases in stages 2 and 4 the additional yield from increased et falls this decreasing marginal productivity is required for di to be optimal under any circumstances we now turn to the estimation of the relationships needed to estimate e t s t s θ s which is composed of basal crop et e t c b s t s θ s k c b k s e t r s θ s and evaporation e s therefore we describe the process used to obtain the three parts of e t c b s t s θ s as well as e s 2 3 2 calculation of reference et e t r s θ s we use hourly weather data and the standardized penman monteith equation to calculate reference et on an hourly basis hourly reference et is then summed by day to create daily estimates of reference et this daily variable is combined with daily estimates of k cb and summed within a growth stage to generate stage specific et 2 3 3 estimation of basal crop coefficient kcb next we estimate k cb which adjusts reference et levels to a specific crop maize k cb is defined as the ratio of the crop evapotranspiration to the reference evapotranspiration allen et al 1998 the challenge with estimating k cb is that its daily value varies over the agricultural growing season and the accumulated number of growing degree days d therefore we use data from lirf to estimate the relationship between daily k cb d and the accumulated number of growing degree days gdds for maize from full irrigation treatments from 2008 to 2013 producing a total of 1076 observations and a bell shaped function fig 2 gdd is a measure of heat accumulation used to predict plant development through the stages and the calculation used here is based on the methodology in jensen and allen 2016 using ordinary least squares regression we estimate the parameters of a polynomial including growing degree days up to the fifth power of a polynomial fitted curve fig 2 the parameters are significant at the 5 level on growing degree days to the powers 0 3 the r squared of this regression is 0 86 in the model we use the predicted value for k cb but introduce the constraint that k c b d 12 1 05 predicted daily values of k cb d are multiplied by daily reference et and summed by plant growth stage to generate stage specific estimates of k c b k s e t r s θ s the number of accumulated gdd defining the transition from one stage to the next are calculated as the average for the full irrigation treatments from 2008 to 2013 the transition from stage 1 to stage 2 occurs after 389 gdds from stage 2 3 after 792 cumulative gdds from stage 3 4 after 1089 cumulative gdds and stage 4 finishes after 1376 cumulative gdds 2 3 4 stress coefficient k s to obtain the last component of et cb s the daily value for stress coefficient k s k s d is defined as the target set for each of the four stages e g k 2 would be 0 4 for a target of 0 40 in stage two in our model and based on the experiment at lirf we allow stress to occur in the second and fourth stage while for the first and third stages there is no deficit irrigation target corresponding to k 1 k 3 1 the stress coefficient k s is then multiplied by k c b e t r s θ s to obtain estimated e t c b s t s θ s for the years 1992 2015 2 3 5 estimation of evaporation e s to calculate e t s t s θ s from e t c b s t s θ s we must estimate evaporation e s we estimate the evaporation scaling factor in each growth stage by averaging stage specific evaporation estimates from 2008 to 2011 based on this calculation the values for e s are the following 1 61233 1 0525 1 02043 and 1 09722 for stages 1 2 3 and 4 respectively these values reflect expected responses in which evaporation is high relative to et cb s in stage 1 when the plants are small low in stages 2 and 3 when et cb s is high and the soil is shaded by the crop canopy and moderate in stage 4 as the canopy begins to senesce 2 3 6 economic parameters we evaluate the economic optimality of di under a range of economic parameters in all cases we assume that available land is 52 6ha representing the area most commonly irrigated by a center pivot irrigation system the price of maize grain and per hectare costs are obtained from csu crop enterprise budgets for the years 2010 2015 csu crop enterprise budgets 2010 2015 per hectare costs include the direct costs operating preharvest operating harvest and property and ownership costs and exclude land rental payments since the opportunity cost of water for a given producer is not known we identify the range of water costs in which di becomes optimal by solving the agro economic model for costs from 0 to 0 38m 3 conditional on 2015 input cost and output price this range spans the potential opportunity costs of water seen in the region of study for example the 2011 cost and return study for irrigated corn silage csu extension 2011 suggests that the financial cost of pumping groundwater is 0 019m 3 producers likely also consider the opportunity cost of water used for irrigating in the colorado big thompson c bt regional pool lease prices reached an average of 0 076m 3 adding electricity costs to this produces a unit water cost of 0 095m 3 finally anecdotal evidence suggests that municipalities have leased water for more than 0 30m 3 after demonstrating how et targets depend on output prices and input costs we parameterize the costs and prices from estimated production costs and returns for irrigated corn in northeastern colorado for all available years 2010 2015 to explore optimal decisions under realized economic conditions in practice the price of inputs is correlated with the price of the commodity zulauf 2016 so we consider costs and price from the same year when examining the optimality of di we specify irrigation efficiency as a linear function that varies with the target to parametrize the equation we assume irrigation efficiency of 75 when fully irrigating the crop and of 100 when the target stress level is at 0 50 recall that soil evaporation losses are considered separately in the es component 2 3 7 solution method and policy scenarios to solve the stochastic problem for optimal et targets t 2 and t 4 we begin by calculating how much water the producer would have used eq 4 and how much yield the producer would have obtained eq 3 for every year between 1992 and 2015 conditional on choices for the et targets and planted area l we then calculate the profit for each year again as a function of et target and l finally we calculate expected profit by averaging profit across each historical weather year from 1992 to 2015 still conditional on a choice of t 2 t 4 and l we assume an equal probability for each year to be replicated garcía vila and fereres 2012 this historical weather distribution represents the information that a producer uses to inform beliefs about the distribution of weather realizations faced at the beginning of a planting season finally a nonlinear solver chooses t 2 t 4 and l to maximize expected profit subject to the land availability constraint 3 results the model is solved under a wide range of maize grain prices and water costs while holding per hectare costs constant to assess the conditions under which di becomes optimal we then show how the cost of water affects planting decisions and et targets holding all else equal finally we demonstrate the water cost ranges in which di becomes optimal given observed historical combinations of per hectare costs and prices for a maize producer in colorado in practice water costs could increase as irrigation districts impose fees to cover increased costs to acquire and deliver water or as energy costs increase to pump water the market value of water will also likely continue to increase as population growth in water scarce regions raises municipal and industrial willingness to pay for water there may also be an increase in environmental values of water as this occurs a producer may realize an increased opportunity cost of water used on the farm the results presented here are qualitatively robust to the choice of data to estimate production function parameters seen in table 1 since production function parameters differ slightly depending on which years are included expected profit varies but water use conditional on et target does not vary because it depends only on the difference between et targets and precipitation the precise prices and costs at which di becomes optimal vary slightly but the qualitative patterns hold across estimated production function parameters fig 3 shows the ranges of water costs and crop prices for which di et target less than 1 provides higher profits than full irrigation et target equal to 1 the grey line shows the combination of prices above which the profit from producing falls to zero profits are maximized for cost combinations above this line by not planting the crop i e fallowing the land the line slopes upward because as the crop price increases production remains profitable at higher water costs the two black lines below the grey line in fig 3 show the range of crop and water prices for which di in stage 2 or 4 becomes profitable cost combinations between the black and grey lines represent conditions for which di provides maximum profits cost combinations below the black lines represent conditions for which full irrigation maximizes profits the level of deficit irrigation reduction in et target that maximizes profit increases for a given crop price as the water price increases the grey upper boundary of the cost combinations within which di is optimal represent the maximum di minimum et target that produces positive profits fig 3 demonstrates that the minimum value of water to incentivize di increases with maize grain price with a lower minimum water cost required to implement di in plant growth stage 2 than in stage 4 the x axis of fig 3 presents the output price per kilogram holding input costs constant at 2015 levels the qualitative results hold for per hectare costs from any of the available years notice that di is never optimal at the realized 2015 price of 0 146kg 1 represented with a vertical line in fig 3 and that no crop should be grown for water costs above 0 1m3 because production plus water costs exceed crop revenue when the stage 2 di curve falls below the curve describing the water cost at which planted hectares goes to zero there exists a water cost at which di becomes optimal in stage 2 fig 3 for example for an output price above 0 19kg 1 it is optimal to implement di for all water costs above the solid black curve and below the grey curve at which planting does not occur similarly at a price above 0 25kg 1 it is optimal to implement di in both stages 2 and 4 for water costs above dashed black curve and below the grey curve a few key results emerge from fig 3 first for 2015 production costs at water costs below 0 21m 3 it is never optimal to implement di next the maize price must reach 0 19kg 1 before di can be optimal under any water cost intuitively the higher the output price the higher the minimum water cost required for di to occur in a given stage this makes sense because a higher output price means that the value marginal product of et increases for a given increase in physical yield as the value marginal product of et increases it becomes optimal to increase the target if not already at 100 finally as the maize price increases the range of water cost within which di becomes optimal increases as seen by the increased distance between the solid black and grey curves as the price increases another important result emerging from fig 3 is that there is no optimal adjustment in the quantity of land planted the planted land falls directly from the total available land to zero as the cost of water increases this occurs because of the assumption of risk neutrality and a uniform water production function for all available land see appendix b for an analysis of the impact of risk aversion on planting and di decisions while fig 3 allows output prices to vary fig 4 presents an example of how optimal et targets depend on water cost using 2012 prices it becomes apparent that in 2012 di became optimal in stage 2 with water costs between 0 292 and 0 378 m 3 when planting no longer occurs since output price and input costs can move together in practice zulauf 2016 we now examine the range of water costs in which di becomes optimal using realized price and cost data from 2010 to 2015 we assume that a producer knows both input and output prices as of planting e g through futures contracts and makes a decision about stage specific et targets given the prices and costs in each of the six years from 2010 to 2015 table 2 presents the prices and per hectare costs for each year and then notes the minimum water cost at which di would have occurred in stages 2 and 4 in 2010 2012 a high water cost could have made di optimal in stage 2 but it is never optimal in 2013 2015 this can be explained by the relatively high maize price experienced in 2010 2012 consistent with fig 3 di can only be optimal once the price exceeds a given threshold the exact threshold depends on per hectare input costs this threshold has not been passed since the maize price fell in 2013 interestingly when commodity prices spiked in 2012 if water became extremely expensive above 0 376m 3 it would have been optimal to implement di in both stage 2 and stage 4 taken together these results suggest that di can become optimal with relative high maize and water costs suggesting that it could be an optimal strategy for responding to increasingly scarce water resources 4 discussion our results suggest that if di is to be used with maize it should be done first in the late vegetative stage and only within a range of water cost the width of this range depends on the output price of maize as well as per hectare production costs di in the maturation grain filling stage requires even higher water costs the results presented here also suggest that efforts to conserve water through di require water prices that likely exceed historical levels in the us high plains in addition the output price of maize must be relatively high compared to input costs for di to be optimal at any water cost even using the lowest per hectare input costs in the years considered 2010 the minimum water cost for di is 0 19m 3with output price at 0 175kg 1 for comparison according to northern colorado water conservancy district the weighted average price paid for water in the colorado big thompson regional pool increased from 0 047m 3 in march of 2016 to 0 076m 3 in march 2017 jon altenhofen personal communication irrigation districts in the san luis valley of colorado charge the highest water fee in the state equal to just 0 06m 3 while current published water costs do not make di optimal anecdotal evidence suggests that oil and gas firms as well as municipalities are beginning to lease water at rates that could incentivize di prices paid for water are in the range of 0 04 to 0 81m 3 with maize grain prices sufficiently high this range includes water costs that would make di optimal but the wide range in observed water costs makes it challenging to predict the appropriate opportunity cost of water for a given producer long term water lease options currently promoted by the colorado water conservation board will enable contracted opportunity costs for irrigation water therefore depending on the opportunity cost of water used for irrigation some producers in the region may be able to gain by choosing et targets of less than 100 comparing water costs across the world there exist some regions of the world where water would be sufficiently scarce to make di optimal though water yield functions may differ in these regions as well for example in the southern murray darling basin in australia water prices were almost 0 15m 3in 2015 and prices in parts of israel were 0 61m 3 as of may 2017 while useful the model presented here has several shortcomings that should be considered in future work for example we assume a static model in which producers choose stage specific et targets at the time of planting in reality a producer can choose initial et targets and adjust them throughout the season based on realized weather and the ability to achieve specified targets next we have assumed a uniform water production function in reality producers often have access to land of varying yield potential when this is the case it could be optimal to remove low quality land from production before doing di on highly productive fields our model does not allow for this possibility another limitation of the model as parameterized here is that we do not allow other inputs and thus costs to vary as et targets vary for example fertilizer or seed requirements may decrease when et and yield targets are reduced reducing water applied may also increase other production costs such as weed and insect control finally we assume that the production function parameters do not vary across years in practice the relationship between et and yield in a given stage could depend on factors not modeled here future research should analyze di within a context of other water conservation options including crop selection and other management strategies such as tillage for example changing planting dates and the timing of irrigation could influence the costs and benefits associated with di also producers may choose to reduce preseason irrigation which can be an inefficient use of water rogers and lamm 1994 while we hold the crop choice fixed maize producers in practice may choose to switch to less water intensive irrigated crops as an alternative to returning to rainfed production thus future research should consider multiple crops as well as the choice of et target per crop a final avenue for future research includes the optimal allocation of a fixed but stochastic water supply 5 conclusion in this paper we develop a stochastic agro economic model of maize production in which a producer chooses plant growth stage specific et targets we examine the conditions in which a producer would optimally implement di and find that for the per hectare cost observed in 2015 di can become economically optimal for maize when maize grain prices reach 0 19kg 1 and water costs exceed 0 21m 3 we test what would have been the optimal et targets for the observed costs and prices in colorado to increasing water costs for the years 2010 2015 and observe that di would have been optimal at water costs above 0 23 0 29m 3 in 2010 2012 years with high maize grain prices the optimality of di holds within a range of water costs whose span depends on the relationship between output price and per hectare costs excluding water costs water costs beyond this range cause a producer to stop planting finally we showed that the risk neutral producer always plants all available land if it is profitable to plant at all the agro economic model developed here integrates agronomic research with economic optimization to provide a framework for evaluating the economic viability of a strategy for responding to increasingly scarce water resources while the focus of this study is on the optimality of di for maize producers the use of econometric procedures to estimate agronomic relationships can provide ex ante information to evaluate a wide range of strategies proposed by agronomists researchers policymakers and producers in a context of increasingly scarce land and water resources this approach to investigating economic viability while accounting for agronomic realities can inform policymakers and provide direction on cost effective strategies for resource conservation acknowledgements thanks to the csu water center for funding this research we also thank the usda ars water management unit for providing the experimental data used to parameterize this model appendix a appendix b risk aversion a2 1 risk aversion to account for risk aversion we specify a constant relative risk aversion utility function over profit with a wealth base of 150 000 with this value we ensure that total consumption for the household is positive even in scenarios when the farm s realized profit is negative with relative risk aversion γ the producer s utility function becomes a2 1 u π π 150 000 1 γ 1 γ γ where positive negative values indicate risk averse seeking behavior when γ 0 the agent is risk neutral and maximizes expected profit to allow for risk aversion we assume γ 2 but optimal et targets vary little with values of γ between 10 and 10 covering a range of relatively risk loving and risk averse decision makers given this the objective function of the producer becomes a2 2 max l 0 l t 2 0 1 t 4 0 1 e u π t l θ results table a2 shows that the inclusion of risk aversion in the model results in a range of water cost within which a producer would plant less than all available land instead of a decrease directly to zero as in the profit maximization model this occurs as a risk averse producer reduces land planted and expected profit in order to reduce the variance in profit as well this behavior occurs because of the strict concavity of u in the optimization model 
11604,modelling cotton production at the farm scale provides insight into the importance of water management options in adapting to climate change especially given the renewed focus of government policies on irrigation water access and allocations using an irrigated cotton farm in southern queensland as a case study we investigated two possible adaptation strategies in response to changes in water resources from projected climate change csiro mk3 5 a1fi scenario the modelled farm produced irrigated cotton wheat maize and non irrigated sorghum the adaptation strategy 1 allowed the substitution of current baseline production system with a system of less intensive cotton 2m row spacing and a maximum of 2 in crop irrigations instead of 4 whereas strategy 2 allowed for the production option of dryland cotton in the rotation and implied as much 2m row spacing cotton planting as possible depending on the other cropping rules regardless of the state of water storages these two strategies were examined using a bio economic farm enterprise model by evaluating the effects of projected changes in yield water use and farm profitability gross margin gm which resulted from

model of cotton production on the darling downs region of southern queensland in order to increase our understanding of the effect of climate change and water policy on yields and gross margins and to develop plausible adaptation strategies previous approaches power and cacho 2014 power et al 2011 have used bio economic models to simulate grain cotton enterprises on the darling downs the novelty of our approach was to compare the adaptation strategies suggested after consultation with the collaborating farmer rather than focussing on identifying optimal farm management strategies 2 materials and methods we developed different scenarios incorporating national water policy and farm business practices on a typical cotton production system in the darling downs region of southern queensland fig 1 projected changes in rainfall temperature and co2 are reflected in modelled crop growth and yield under future climate scenarios adaptation strategies will be required to manage reduced in crop rainfall and irrigation water availability plausible strategies were identified in consultation with cotton producers and are discussed in detail in the following sections 2 1 the farm level assessment model apsim s multi field capability was used to develop a farm level model farm management such as crop sowing rules that determines what crop to sow in which field or the movement of water to irrigate crops was implemented by a computer scripting language de voil et al 2009 within apsim by using sowing rules the farm model will respond to the different climatic conditions of either historical or projected climates if the sowing rules determine that no crop be planted then the field is in fallow in such case a weed model de voil et al 2009 which responds to climate conditions and cropping intensity is used to estimate fallow costs due to weed management fertiliser rates at sowing were determined by the crop nitrogen requirements and were obtained by the collaborating farmer a daily net balance of the soil nitrogen was modelled by apsim s nitrogen module soiln probert et al 1998 this resulted in fertiliser amounts and corresponding costs which varied with seasonal conditions cropping histories and intensity the timing and amount of irrigation applied to a crop was determined by the difference between crop demand and soil water supply when extractable soil water falls below a critical value water is pumped from a water source such as a storage or bore to the field and the crop is irrigated in some cases when the level of the storage is sufficiently high water can gravitate out and pumps are not operated the level of the storage below which water had to be pumped was obtained from the farmer during the interviews the on farm water sources were modelled via instances of apsim s watersupply module gaydon and lisson 2005 and were configured to be bores with annual allocation ml and two open storages which were subject to daily water losses due to seepage and evaporation and were topped up from intercepted rainfall off farm overland flow and on farm field runoff the calculation of captured on farm runoff into farm storages

pumping of return tail water t and water harvesting costs wh wh is a variable cost and is calculated for each cropping enterprise in a year by apportioning the pumping costs to harvest the overland flow based on the amount of applied irrigation to each crop for the year 2 2 the case study farm as described by power and cacho 2014 the case study farm was 446 5ha irrigated grain cotton enterprise situated on the eastern darling downs queensland fig 1 it comprised 12 fields which a previous soil classification dalgliesh and foale 2005 has described as a black vertosol mywybilla apsoil database no 900 the details of the farm fields are listed in table 1 each field was irrigated from captured on farm runoff collected into one of two on farm water storages the timing and choice of either cotton maize wheat or sorghum crop to sow in each field was determined by evaluating the rules listed in table 2 with cotton given a priority the stored water listed in the sowing rules could be either bound to a parcel of land as soil water or unbound water for irrigation that was stored in either on farm open water storages or as un used bore allocation these rules were used to allocate farm area to be planted to each crop as a function of stored water at the time of sowing and were not an indication of the required water to grow a successful crop table 3 lists the agronomic parameters for each crop sorghum was not irrigated and therefore there was no irrigation threshold for more details about the implementation of farm management see power and cacho 2014 the case study farm employed furrow irrigation was implemented in the model pumping 25 more water than was required to fill the soil profile from the storage transmission losses due to drainage and evaporation were incurred at a rate of 10 of the amount pumped from the storage to the field and for the return of tail water these percentages and additional pump capacities were supplied by the collaborating farmer corresponding pump operating times were calculated pumping costs due to operation and maintenance of pumps also incurred irrigation water was supplied by two on farm storages labelled east and west table 1 with a combined capacity of 800 ml and each supply irrigation water to fixed farm fields with combined areas of 230 and 216 5ha for the west and east storages respectively the farm had a number of bores with an annual allocation of 200 ml per year with 100 carryover i e 100 of any unused allocation can be carried over to the following year table 4 lists the model parameterisation of each source of irrigation water detailed prices and variable costs for each cropping enterprise and farm pumping costs were elicited from the farmer and are available in the supplementary tables s1 s5 these economic values were maintained at present values so that the effect of climate change on farm profitability could be more easily identified 2 3 climate projections the crop and farm simulation models require daily meteorological data we used the dalby post office meteorological recording site bureau of meteorology site number 041023 latitude 27 18 s longitude 151 26 e to represent the dalby district of the darling downs in southern queensland historical weather data maximum and minimum temperatures solar radiation and rainfall for 1960 2010 were sourced from the silo historical dataset http www longpaddock qld gov au silo jeffrey et al 2001 future climate change scenarios were based on the csiro mk3 5 general circulation model simulation using the a1fi sres emissions scenario ipcc 2000 this is the highest emission scenario it is described as the business as usual emissions pathway that is future emissions occur at historical rates with no mitigation strategies implemented it is most similar to the representative concentration pathway 8 5 as used in the fifth assessment report as shown by fuss et al 2014 this emission scenario matches the observed emissions maximum and minimum temperature solar radiation rainfall data for 2030 and 2050 were obtained from the silo consistent climate change scenarios ccs database https www longpaddock qld gov au climateprojections dsiti 2015 ccs projections data for 2030 or 2050 were 30 year period data centred on that year a summary of the csiro mk3 5 rainfall scenarios is presented in fig 2 the bore allocation was reduced by 14 to 172 ml year for years 2030 and 2050 to simulate possible reductions that might occur the mdb plan mdba 2011 offers a wide range of estimates for possible reductions in water allocation for the condamine catchment we therefore selected a scenario which was neither negligible nor extreme applying the same allocation for 2050 as for 2030 is a conservative position but the policy horizon is too far to make any further assumptions there will however be a changed climate in 2050 compared to 2030 and so that change will be reflected in the farm management decisions 2 4 adaptation options two possible adaption strategies were identified by the case study farmer as the most likely he would use to cope with the impacts of changes in climate and water allocation the fundamental requirement was to ensure that cotton was kept as part of the cropping mix since there was a high level of expertise invested in both experience and equipment resulting in high levels of inertia in crop selection decisions and because of the relative high profitability of cotton the two strategies represented different spacing between rows and different irrigation amounts strategy 1 allowed the substitution of some of the baseline production system with a system of less intensive cotton planted at 2m row spacing instead of 1m with a maximum of two in crop irrigations instead of four and with the same planting rules except the availability of 2 ml ha stored water instead of the previous 4 ml ha table 2 strategy 2 allowed for the production option of dryland cotton planted on a 2m row spacing the second strategy implied that as much 2m row spacing cotton was planted as possible depending on the other cropping rules regardless of the state of the storages the baseline scenario was the current production system tables 2 and 3 and was run with current climate 1960 2010 3 results 3 1 crop yields the simulations of the grain cotton enterprise showed that without any adaptation to climate change such as changes to planting or irrigation strategies the median cotton yield t ha increased slightly in the 2050s fig 3 however the area of cotton that could be planted decreased by 19 in the 2030s and 35 in the 2050s table 5 if strategy 1 was pursued fig 4 a 2m rows and partial irrigation there was a decrease in yield of 12 1 in 2030 and 4 4 in 2050 compared to the baseline case under strategy 1 the area of cotton planted at 1m row spacing was reduced in 2030 by 21 2 from 73 0ha to 57 5ha and by 19 2 to 59ha by 2050 however the overall area of cotton could be increased by 36 and 38 in 2030 and 2050 respectively because of the inclusion of irrigated cotton planted at 2m with strategy 2 fig 4b the area of 1m planted cotton was reduced by 45 in 2030 and 2050 but the total area of cotton increased by 90 from the baseline in 2030 and 67 in 2050 table 5 because of the inclusion of dryland cotton furthermore the proportion of low yields i e 5bales ha increased over the same periods under strategy 2 if such low yields were to occur in consecutive years such as during a prolonged drought then the losses incurred by the farm might be significant yields from the 2m row spacing increased by a similar margin to the solid planting largely due to co2 fertilisation williams et al 2015 however there was an increase in the year to year variation in cotton yields compared to continuous solid planting of cotton because of the increased reliance on in crop rainfall median yields were similar between the strategies but the inter annual variability of yield increased under strategy 2 figs 4a and 4b 3 2 water use and availability the total irrigation applied to the simulated cotton crop under the present climate was 257 ml under the climate change scenario utilised the amount of water harvested and water applied was greater for strategy 2 table 6 even though there was less rainfall this is due to the increase in cropping area creating greater demand for irrigation and hence an increase in the capacity to harvest water the increase in applied irrigation water resulted in reduced production per ml there was 14 less water available in 2030 and 2050 which reduced input costs although there was a decline in 2030 and 2050and on one occasion the storage was exhausted an excess water available without adaptation could be observed fig 5 the adaptation strategies made greater use of stored water and hence had lower harvest levels but rarely to less than 20 of capacity this could well be an effective strategy for producers who are risk takers the reduction in rainfall did not have a simple linear relationship with the amount of runoff harvested into water storages when storages were run down there was a greater capacity to harvest run off and conversely a reduction in harvested runoff without adaptation although this outcome did not change significantly for the two adaptation strategies fig 6 this suggests that the model used to capture runoff was quite conservative 3 3 gross margins farm financial variables were calculated as total gross margin farm level crop gross margin and crop gross margin per ha without adaptation the total gross margin was reduced by 27 from 253 701 to 186 431 in 2030 and 43 from 253 701 to 144 688 by 2050 table 7 the losses were largely due to the reduction in irrigated crops even though sorghum showed a 22 23 increase in crop gross margin adaptation strategy 1 resulted in an 8 8 increase in the total gross margin by 2030 but a 15 8 decrease by 2050 i e a 7 8 decrease compared to the present however with dryland cotton in the rotation adaptation strategy 2 there was an increased farm gross margin of 49 by 2030 and 12 by 2050 table 7 gross margins for cotton grown on 2m rows were greater than when grown with 1m rows because the latter has a greater irrigation requirement and higher costs in terms of establishment however if cotton on 2m rows was grown to the exclusion of cotton grown on 1m rows then overall production was reduced farm level gross margins increased in 2030 and 2050 because the area of cotton planted increased under both adaptation strategies table 5 4 discussion this study took farm level crop modelling a step further by integrating the production of cotton with decisions that have to be made about the allocation of limited resources the main limitation considered in this study was the use of water given likely future access and volume restrictions due to climate change and national government water policies water security is essential for cotton producers to be able to plan invest in and irrigates or water stock mushtaq 2016 many farmers especially cotton producers have invested considerable sums of money in new irrigation systems and on farm technologies to cope with changes to the water availability and to enhance water use efficiencies yet they are struggling to cope with the uncertainties surrounding water policies that can influence future water allocations and water supplies kiem 2013 wei et al 2011 understanding crop level responses using apsim at the paddock level can provide a great deal of information about the likely response in terms of yield however farms tend to be more complex with a range of crops markets and resource limitations to consider the modular nature of a farm level apsim provides a way to consider other planting strategies and crops it also helps as a set of rules can be developed to simulate the decisions made at the farm scale this can be set against historical or future climates and can be used to consider the implications of government water policies developed at a higher level in addition to considering the changes in rainfall that are likely to occur in 2030 and 2050 we also considered in our study the policy implications of the murray darling basin plan mdba 2012 this is an evolving suite of policy and legislation and specific decisions of the future can be easily included in the framework at some point in the future in general the study region is projected to receive less rainfall and consequently reduced inflow to the rivers and on farm storages therefore the amount of irrigation water available would reduce and restrict the area of land that can be irrigated specifically we used a modest 14 reduction in bore allocation coupled with reduced overland flow due to decreased rainfall adaptation to climate change and reduced water allocation was introduced into the simulation by considering opportunities for partial irrigation and dryland planting of cotton at wider row spacing a mechanism was included by which cotton was preferentially retained in the mix of crops because an enterprise that is built around cotton is likely to remain so unless very strong forces act upon it the other crops wheat maize and sorghum retained with the present agronomic conditions and water requirements williams et al 2015 showed that initially cotton responds favourably to changes in climate variables and co2 fertilisation with an increase in yield of 5 9 by 2030 however the cotton yield decreased by 3 6 by 2050 when the climate become unfavourable for crop growth and it was no longer offset by co2 fertilisation regardless of the uncertainty in rainfall projections it is likely that water stress will increase due to the rising temperatures and decrease in water balance this will lead to an increasing focus on water use efficiency water access and soil water management this study demonstrated that without adaptation overall farm gross margins would decrease due to the combination of climate change and government policies reducing irrigation water availability the two adaptation scenarios explored here demonstrated that it is possible to have a productive farm enterprise in the future in the darling downs and that current cropping regimes could be adjusted the long term gross margin is indicative of the capacity of the system to cope with change individual farm level studies would need to be done on a case by case basis to investigate the profitability of specific farms one of the benefits of farming in a region historically prone to significant annual and seasonal climate variability is that producers have relatively high levels of diversification this may well enable them to consider adaptation options with greater ease compared with farmers who have not had to incorporate strategies to overcome climate variability if suitable adaptation techniques can be utilised then the impact of the loss of water through both climate change and water policy can be reduced cotton appears to be relatively adaptable to drought because its production is relatively flexible loch et al 2013 prosser 2011 however the industry already practices a high degree of water efficiency and therefore the best adaptation strategy may be through planting strategies such as 2m cotton with partial irrigation rather than substantially changing the way the crop is irrigated the adverse impacts of climate change and reduced water allocation can be partially offset with appropriate adaptation applied to cotton production a more complete investigation could be undertaken whereby the whole farm enterprise is optimised however this was outside the scope of this study since we were primarily interested in demonstrating the utility of the approach when considering possible adaptation strategies there are benefits to utilising both biophysical models and expert knowledge to enhance our understanding of the impacts of climate change and government policies on crop production and the most effective ways to adapt there are many studies that link climate with cotton and agricultural outcomes such as yields and farm profits this study has used a theoretical model incorporating plant growth theory in a simulation model to estimate links between climate water availability and cotton yields this complex and dynamic approach addresses physiological processes that are not easily estimated in regression frameworks however there are caveats that need to be acknowledged including model complexity uncertainty about some of the processes and the large number of parameters in addition the model sensitivity will vary depending on the specific future climate scenario selected different general circulation models produce different future climate scenarios although the pattern of change from 2030 to 2050 is likely to be constant acknowledgements this study acknowledges the funding received from the drought and climate adaptation dcap

11604,modelling cotton production at the farm scale provides insight into the importance of water management options in adapting to climate change especially given the renewed focus of government policies on irrigation water access and allocations using an irrigated cotton farm in southern queensland as a case study we investigated two possible adaptation strategies in response to changes in water resources from projected climate change csiro mk3 5 a1fi scenario the modelled farm produced irrigated cotton wheat maize and non irrigated sorghum the adaptation strategy 1 allowed the substitution of current baseline production system with a system of less intensive cotton 2m row spacing and a maximum of 2 in crop irrigations instead of 4 whereas strategy 2 allowed for the production option of dryland cotton in the rotation and implied as much 2m row spacing cotton planting as possible depending on the other cropping rules regardless of the state of water storages these two strategies were examined using a bio economic farm enterprise model by evaluating the effects of projected changes in yield water use and farm profitability gross margin gm which resulted from

assessment model apsim s multi field capability was used to develop a farm level model farm management such as crop sowing rules that determines what crop to sow in which field or the movement of water to irrigate crops was implemented by a computer scripting language de voil et al 2009 within apsim by using sowing rules the farm model will respond to the different climatic conditions of either historical or projected climates if the sowing rules determine that no crop be planted then the field is in fallow in such case a weed model de voil et al 2009 which responds to climate conditions and cropping intensity is used to estimate fallow costs due to weed management fertiliser rates at sowing were determined by the crop nitrogen requirements and were obtained by the collaborating farmer a daily net balance of the soil nitrogen was modelled by apsim s nitrogen module soiln probert et al 1998 this resulted in fertiliser amounts and corresponding costs which varied with seasonal conditions cropping histories and intensity the timing and amount of irrigation applied to a crop was determined by the difference between crop demand and soil water supply when extractable soil water falls below a critical value water is pumped from a water source such as a storage or bore to the field and the crop is irrigated in some cases when the level of the storage is sufficiently high water can gravitate out and pumps are not operated the level of the storage below which water had to be pumped was obtained from the farmer during the interviews the on farm water sources were modelled via instances of apsim s watersupply module gaydon and lisson 2005 and were configured to be bores with annual allocation ml and two open storages which were subject to daily water losses due to seepage and evaporation and were topped up from intercepted rainfall off farm overland flow and on farm field runoff the calculation of captured on farm runoff into farm storages is given by 1 r m l min w s m l t l i 1 n r i a i 100 where rml is the total farm runoff ml calculated daily wsml is the available capacity in ml of the farm water storage of interest tl is the transmission loss from moving water from the fields into storages and is due to evaporation and drainage in channels ri is the runoff mm from field i and modelled by apsim s soil water module soilwat probert et al 1998 and ai is the area ha of field i the model s economic output annual total farm gross margin gmfarm was calculated by assigning an economic value to every modelled event such as crop sowing and harvests weed events and operation of farm pumps crop prices and variable costs were obtained during interviews with the collaborating farmer and represented what the farmer would expect over the long term and hence excluded any recent movements the annual total farm gross margin is calculated as follow 2 g m f a r m i 1 12 g m f i e l d i where gmfarm is the aggregate gross margin

pumping of return tail water t and water harvesting costs wh wh is a variable cost and is calculated for each cropping enterprise in a year by apportioning the pumping costs to harvest the overland flow based on the amount of applied irrigation to each crop for the year 2 2 the case study farm as described by power and cacho 2014 the case study farm was 446 5ha irrigated grain cotton enterprise situated on the eastern darling downs queensland fig 1 it comprised 12 fields which a previous soil classification dalgliesh and foale 2005 has described as a black vertosol mywybilla apsoil database no 900 the details of the farm fields are listed in table 1 each field was irrigated from captured on farm runoff collected into one of two on farm water storages the timing and choice of either cotton maize wheat or sorghum crop to sow in each field was determined by evaluating the rules listed in table 2 with cotton given a priority the stored water listed in the sowing rules could be either bound to a parcel of land as soil water or unbound water for irrigation that was stored in either on farm open water storages or as un used bore allocation these rules were used to allocate farm area to be planted to each crop as a function of stored water at the time of sowing and were not an indication of the required water to grow a successful crop table 3 lists the agronomic parameters for each crop sorghum was not irrigated and therefore there was no irrigation threshold for more details about the implementation of farm management see power and cacho 2014 the case study farm employed furrow irrigation was implemented in the model pumping 25 more water than was required to fill the soil profile from the storage transmission losses due to drainage and evaporation were incurred at a rate of 10 of the amount pumped from the storage to the field and for the return of tail water these percentages and additional pump capacities were supplied by the collaborating farmer corresponding pump operating times were calculated pumping costs due to operation and maintenance of pumps also incurred irrigation water was supplied by two on farm storages labelled east and west table 1 with a combined capacity of 800 ml and each supply irrigation water to fixed farm fields with combined areas of 230 and 216 5ha for the west and east storages respectively the farm had a number of bores with an annual allocation of 200 ml per year with 100 carryover i e 100 of any unused allocation can be carried over to the following year table 4 lists the model parameterisation of each source of irrigation water detailed prices and variable costs for each cropping enterprise and farm pumping costs were elicited from the farmer and are available in the supplementary tables s1 s5 these economic values were maintained at present values so that the effect of climate change on farm profitability could be more easily identified 2 3 climate projections the crop and farm simulation models require daily meteorological data we used the dalby post office meteorological recording site bureau of meteorology site number 041023 latitude 27 18 s longitude 151 26 e to represent the dalby district of the darling downs in southern queensland historical weather data maximum and minimum temperatures solar radiation and rainfall for 1960 2010 were sourced from the silo historical dataset http www longpaddock qld gov au silo jeffrey et al 2001 future climate change scenarios were based on the csiro mk3 5 general circulation model simulation using the a1fi sres emissions scenario ipcc 2000 this is the highest emission scenario it is described as the business as usual emissions pathway that is future emissions occur at historical rates with no mitigation strategies implemented it is most similar to the representative concentration pathway 8 5 as used in the fifth assessment report as shown by fuss et al 2014 this emission scenario matches the observed emissions maximum and minimum temperature solar radiation rainfall data for 2030 and 2050 were obtained from the silo consistent climate change scenarios ccs database https www longpaddock qld gov au climateprojections dsiti 2015 ccs projections data for 2030 or 2050 were 30 year period data centred on that year a summary of the csiro mk3 5 rainfall scenarios is presented in fig 2 the bore allocation was reduced by 14 to 172 ml year for years 2030 and 2050 to simulate possible reductions that might occur the mdb plan mdba 2011 offers a wide range of estimates for possible reductions in water allocation for the condamine catchment we therefore selected a scenario which was neither negligible nor extreme applying the same allocation for 2050 as for 2030 is a conservative position but the policy horizon is too far to make any further assumptions there will however be a changed climate in 2050 compared to 2030 and so that change will be reflected in the farm management decisions 2 4 adaptation options two possible adaption strategies were identified by the case study farmer as the most likely he would use to cope with the impacts of changes in climate and water allocation the fundamental requirement was to ensure that cotton was kept as part of the cropping mix since there was a high level of expertise invested in both experience and equipment resulting in high levels of inertia in crop selection decisions and because of the relative high profitability of cotton the two strategies represented different spacing between rows and different irrigation amounts strategy 1 allowed the substitution of some of the baseline production system with a system of less intensive cotton planted at 2m row spacing instead of 1m with a maximum of two in crop irrigations instead of four and with the same planting rules except the availability of 2 ml ha stored water instead of the previous 4 ml ha table 2 strategy 2 allowed for the production option of dryland cotton planted on a 2m row spacing the second strategy implied that as much 2m row spacing cotton was planted as possible depending on the other cropping rules regardless of the state of the storages the baseline scenario was the current production system tables 2 and 3 and was run with current climate 1960 2010 3 results 3 1 crop yields the simulations of the grain cotton enterprise showed that without any adaptation to climate change such as changes to planting or irrigation strategies the median cotton yield t ha increased slightly in the 2050s fig 3 however the area of cotton that could be planted decreased by 19 in the 2030s and 35 in the 2050s table 5 if strategy 1 was pursued fig 4 a 2m rows and partial irrigation there was a decrease in yield of 12 1 in 2030 and 4 4 in 2050 compared to the baseline case under strategy 1 the area of cotton planted at 1m row spacing was reduced in 2030 by 21 2 from 73 0ha to 57 5ha and by 19 2 to 59ha by 2050 however the overall area of cotton could be increased by 36 and 38 in 2030 and 2050 respectively because of the inclusion of irrigated cotton planted at 2m with strategy 2 fig 4b the area of 1m planted cotton was reduced by 45 in 2030 and 2050 but the total area of cotton increased by 90 from the baseline in 2030 and 67 in 2050 table 5 because of the inclusion of dryland cotton furthermore the proportion of low yields i e 5bales ha increased over the same periods under strategy 2 if such low yields were to occur in consecutive years such as during a prolonged drought then the losses incurred by the farm might be significant yields from the 2m row spacing increased by a similar margin to the solid planting largely due to co2 fertilisation williams et al 2015 however there was an increase in the year to year variation in cotton yields compared to continuous solid planting of cotton because of the increased reliance on in crop rainfall median yields were similar between the strategies but the inter annual variability of yield increased under strategy 2 figs 4a and 4b 3 2 water use and availability the total irrigation applied to the simulated cotton crop under the present climate was 257 ml under the climate change scenario utilised the amount of water harvested and water applied was greater for strategy 2 table 6 even though there was less rainfall this is due to the increase in cropping area creating greater demand for irrigation and hence an increase in the capacity to harvest water the increase in applied irrigation water resulted in reduced production per ml there was 14 less water available in 2030 and 2050 which reduced input costs although there was a decline in 2030 and 2050and on one occasion the storage was exhausted an excess water available without adaptation could be observed fig 5 the adaptation strategies made greater use of stored water and hence had lower harvest levels but rarely to less than 20 of capacity this could well be an effective strategy for producers who are risk takers the reduction in rainfall did not have a simple linear relationship with the amount of runoff harvested into water storages when storages were run down there was a greater capacity to harvest run off and conversely a reduction in harvested runoff without adaptation although this outcome did not change significantly for the two adaptation strategies fig 6 this suggests that the model used to capture runoff was quite conservative 3 3 gross margins farm financial variables were calculated as total gross margin farm level crop gross margin and crop gross margin per ha without adaptation the total gross margin was reduced by 27 from 253 701 to 186 431 in 2030 and 43 from 253 701 to 144 688 by 2050 table 7 the losses were largely due to the reduction in irrigated crops even though sorghum showed a 22 23 increase in crop gross margin adaptation strategy 1 resulted in an 8 8 increase in the total gross margin by 2030 but a 15 8 decrease by 2050 i e a 7 8 decrease compared to the present however with dryland cotton in the rotation adaptation strategy 2 there was an increased farm gross margin of 49 by 2030 and 12 by 2050 table 7 gross margins for cotton grown on 2m rows were greater than when grown with 1m rows because the latter has a greater irrigation requirement and higher costs in terms of establishment however if cotton on 2m rows was grown to the exclusion of cotton grown on 1m rows then overall production was reduced farm level gross margins increased in 2030 and 2050 because the area of cotton planted increased under both adaptation strategies table 5 4 discussion this study took farm level crop modelling a step further by integrating the production of cotton with decisions that have to be made about the allocation of limited resources the main limitation considered in this study was the use of water given likely future access and volume restrictions due to climate change and national government water policies water security is essential for cotton producers to be able to plan invest in and irrigates or water stock mushtaq 2016 many farmers especially cotton producers have invested considerable sums of money in new irrigation systems and on farm technologies to cope with changes to the water availability and to enhance water use efficiencies yet they are struggling to cope with the uncertainties surrounding water policies that can influence future water allocations and water supplies kiem 2013 wei et al 2011 understanding crop level responses using apsim at the paddock level can provide a great deal of information about the likely response in terms of yield however farms tend to be more complex with a range of crops markets and resource limitations to consider the modular nature of a farm level apsim provides a way to consider other planting strategies and crops it also helps as a set of rules can be developed to simulate the decisions made at the farm scale this can be set against historical or future climates and can be used to consider the implications of government water policies developed at a higher level in addition to considering the changes in rainfall that are likely to occur in 2030 and 2050 we also considered in our study the policy implications of the murray darling basin plan mdba 2012 this is an evolving suite of policy and legislation and specific decisions of the future can be easily included in the framework at some point in the future in general the study region is projected to receive less rainfall and consequently reduced inflow to the rivers and on farm storages therefore the amount of irrigation water available would reduce and restrict the area of land that can be irrigated specifically we used a modest 14 reduction in bore allocation coupled with reduced overland flow due to decreased rainfall adaptation to climate change and reduced water allocation was introduced into the simulation by considering opportunities for partial irrigation and dryland planting of cotton at wider row spacing a mechanism was included by which cotton was preferentially retained in the mix of crops because an enterprise that is built around cotton is likely to remain so unless very strong forces act upon it the other crops wheat maize and sorghum retained with the present agronomic conditions and water requirements williams et al 2015 showed that initially cotton responds favourably to changes in climate variables and co2 fertilisation with an increase in yield of 5 9 by 2030 however the cotton yield decreased by 3 6 by 2050 when the climate become unfavourable for crop growth and it was no longer offset by co2 fertilisation regardless of the uncertainty in rainfall projections it is likely that water stress will increase due to the rising temperatures and decrease in water balance this will lead to an increasing focus on water use efficiency water access and soil water management this study demonstrated that without adaptation overall farm gross margins would decrease due to the combination of climate change and government policies reducing irrigation water availability the two adaptation scenarios explored here demonstrated that it is possible to have a productive farm enterprise in the future in the darling downs and that current cropping regimes could be adjusted the long term gross margin is indicative of the capacity of the system to cope with change individual farm level studies would need to be done on a case by case basis to investigate the profitability of specific farms one of the benefits of farming in a region historically prone to significant annual and seasonal climate variability is that producers have relatively high levels of diversification this may well enable them to consider adaptation options with greater ease compared with farmers who have not had to incorporate strategies to overcome climate variability if suitable adaptation techniques can be utilised then the impact of the loss of water through both climate change and water policy can be reduced cotton appears to be relatively adaptable to drought because its production is relatively flexible loch et al 2013 prosser 2011 however the industry already practices a high degree of water efficiency and therefore the best adaptation strategy may be through planting strategies such as 2m cotton with partial irrigation rather than substantially changing the way the crop is irrigated the adverse impacts of climate change and reduced water allocation can be partially offset with appropriate adaptation applied to cotton production a more complete investigation could be undertaken whereby the whole farm enterprise is optimised however this was outside the scope of this study since we were primarily interested in demonstrating the utility of the approach when considering possible adaptation strategies there are benefits to utilising both biophysical models and expert knowledge to enhance our understanding of the impacts of climate change and government policies on crop production and the most effective ways to adapt there are many studies that link climate with cotton and agricultural outcomes such as yields and farm profits this study has used a theoretical model incorporating plant growth theory in a simulation model to estimate links between climate water availability and cotton yields this complex and dynamic approach addresses physiological processes that are not easily estimated in regression frameworks however there are caveats that need to be acknowledged including model complexity uncertainty about some of the processes and the large number of parameters in addition the model sensitivity will vary depending on the specific future climate scenario selected different general circulation models produce different future climate scenarios although the pattern of change from 2030 to 2050 is likely to be constant acknowledgements this study acknowledges the funding received from the drought and climate adaptation dcap
