17930,a large number of plastic products potentially become smaller particles including nanoplastics under multiple actions in the environment the interactions between nanoplastic particles and constituents in the environment such as minerals would greatly affect the transport fate and toxic effects of nanoplastics in this study the interactions of polystyrene nanoplastic psnp with four typical minerals including goethite magnetite kaolinite and montmorillonite in aqueous phase were investigated the stability of psnp colloidal suspension decreased in the presence of the positively charged goethite or magnetite while it was not affected by the negatively charged montmorillonite and kaolinite suggesting that there was a strong electrostatic attraction between psnp and the two iron oxides incubation of psnp with other three metal oxides with different surface charges mno2 al2o3 and sio2 confirmed the importance of electrostatic interaction in the stability of psnp suspension the transmission electron microscopy tem analysis and batch adsorption experiments indicated that psnp was effectively adsorbed on goethite or magnetite due to the strong electrostatic attraction between them the fourier transform infrared spectra ftir and two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos analyses indicated that there was strong hydrogen bonding between the oh γ feooh of goethite and psnp contributing to the higher adsorption of psnp on goethite than magnetite these findings shed light on the interactions of psnp with mineral surfaces and potential fate of psnp

environmental processes of nps are raising concerns due to the their potentially greater mobility higher exposure and toxicities to organisms liu et al 2019a therefore it is very important to evaluate the environmental behaviors and ecological risks of nps the interactions of nps with the components in the environment may greatly affect the transport effects and fates of nps alimi et al 2018 as an important components of soils and sediments minerals are widely present in water with large surface areas and many functional groups han et al 2008 previous studies demonstrated that minerals played vital roles in the transport and fate of quite a few contaminants including organic pollutants and heavy metals li et al 2019 qin et al 2018 zhu et al 2012 recent studies demonstrated that soil minerals greatly affected the stability and transport of biochar liu et al 2018 graphene oxide go zhao et al 2015 and even some bacteria yan et al 2016 and electrostatic forces played key roles in the aggregation and transport of these materials like go and biochar nps are carbon containing polymers with many surface functional groups which make nps negatively charged a recent study suggested that plastic particles interacted with iron oxides to affect their migration and deposition behaviors in porous media li et al 2019 because of the large surface area to volume ratio and rich functional groups such as so3h nh2 ch3 cc coo mao et al 2020b wang et al 2018 on the surface nps could interact with a variety of pollutants and serve as a transport vehicle in environmental matrix for contaminants such as persistent organic pollutants hirai et al 2011 heavy metals guo et al 2020 holmes et al 2012 and contaminants with emerging concerns ng and obbard 2006 it is hypothesized that the functional groups of nps may also interact with minerals in the environment traditional one dimensional fourier transform infrared spectra ftir have been widely used to characterize the interfacial interactions between adsorbent and substrates yin et al 2018 however it fails to clarify the order in which the different functional groups change during the interaction abdulla et al 2010 two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos is based on the response of a set of ftir spectra to certain external disturbances such as oxidant concentration temperature and ph and reveals sequence change of different functional groups zhou et al 2017 recently 2d ftir cos analysis has been successfully applied to investigate the interaction mechanisms of metals and nanomaterials chen et al 2014b with various substrates such as macromolecules yu et al 2012 the change of functional groups in the adsorption process of nps and minerals could be understood more clearly by using 2d ftir cos the main objective of this study is to explore the interactions between nps and minerals in the environment due to the wide application of polystyrene plastics polystyrene nanoplastic psnp was selected as the model of nps alimi et al 2018 the interactions between psnp and several typical minerals kaolinite montmorillonite magnetite goethite which are widely present in the environment and have different surface charges were systematically investigated using batch adsorption experiments ftir 2d cos scanning electron microscopy sem and other characterization methods were applied to reveal the intrinsic interaction mechanisms between them the results provide a reference for further research on migration transformation and degradation of nps 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials steep magnetite sigma aldrich goethite sigma aldrich kaolinite fluka and montmorillonite fluka in 0 5 m cacl2 and nacl solution for 12 h respectively to prepare na and ca saturated minerals repeat the steeping process four times and then wash the minerals with distilled di water until no cl was detected with agno3 solution wang and xing 2005 zhang et al 2012 the ca and na saturated minerals were recorded as kao ca mon ca goe ca mag ca and kao na mon na goe na mag na respectively these na and ca saturated minerals were used to avoid the possible effects of mixed exchangeable cations e g ca2 k and na on the interaction between minerals and psnp all the mineral samples were freeze dried ground and sifted through a 0 15 mm screen the suspension of psnp 20 mg l was obtained by diluting the standard psnp solution purchased from thermo 10000 mg l with di water sonicated for 30 min 20 khz kq 300de shumei and then stored in 4 c refrigerator the concentration of psnp in the suspension was measured by fluorescence spectrophotometer rf 6000 shimadzu japan and the concentration of psnp was calculated using a standard curve with 6 points fig s1 2 2 uv vis absorbance of minerals in the presence of psnp the absorbance of the minerals was measured using a uv vis spectrophotometer genesys 10s uv vis at the wavelength of 800 nm the psnp suspension 20 mg l was sonicated for 5 min 20 khz kq 300de shumei before use subsequently 20 mg of minerals mag ca mag na goe ca goe na kao ca kao na mon ca or mon na were added to a 20 ml vial containing 10 ml of psnp suspension or di water the mixture was shaken in the dark for 2 days 150 rpm 25 c and then set still for 5 h the supernatant 4 ml was carefully removed to measure the absorbance 2 3 adsorption of psnp on the minerals in a preliminary study the minerals were incubated with the psnp suspension and the mixture was centrifuged the minerals could be effectively separated from the suspensions of psnp by centrifuging 3000 rpm 30 min while the psnp suspension after centrifugation remained very stable after sonication 5 min 20 khz this suggested that centrifugation was effective for the separation of minerals in the dispersed psnp suspensions thus the interaction between psnp and minerals might be considered as an adsorption process of psnp on minerals for a typical adsorption experiment add 20 mg of minerals mag ca mag na goe ca goe na kao ca kao na mon ca or mon na to a 20 ml vial containing 10 ml of psnp suspensions 0 10 mg l psnp was sonicated in di water for 5 min 20 khz at 25 c to obtain the psnp suspensions all the vials were shaken in the dark 25 c for 12 h to achieve equilibrium and then centrifuged 3000 rpm 30 min to get rid of the minerals from the psnp suspension after centrifugation remove the supernatant 5 ml carefully to detect the psnp concentration at 468 nm of ex and 508 nm of em using a fluorescence spectrophotometer rf 6000 shimadzu japan the details about the adsorption of psnp on goethite and magnetite and adsorption models are provided in the supporting information si in order to further study the impacts of mineral characters e g size chemical compositions and surface charge on the interactions between psnp and minerals three other mineral particles al2o3 40 50 nm alfa aesar co mno2 50 60 nm acros organics co and sio2 1 5 μm fisher co which are also widely present in natural environment were used as adsorbents all the minerals were cleaned with di water before use the zeta potentials of the three particles as a function of the ph of the suspension the pzcs point of zero charges of the three particles were measured 2 4 release of fe3 from goethite and magnetite and its impact on psnp aggregation the fe ions dissolved from magnetite and goethite at different ph were studied briefly add 10 ml of di water to a vial containing 20 mg of magnetite mag na or goethite goe na the solution ph was adjusted with hno3 and koh to 3 0 11 0 after shaking 150 rpm 2 days the suspension was centrifuged 3000 rpm 30 min and then passed through a teflon filter membrane 0 22 μm the concentration of fe ions in the filtrate was measured utilizing inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms icaprq thermo fisher the effect of fe3 ions on psnp aggregation and sedimentation was studied by comparing with na and ca2 in the freshly prepared psnp suspensions a certain volume of a specific chloride salt solution was introduced to achieve a final psnp concentration of 20 mg l the final concentrations of na ca2 and fe3 in the suspensions were 0 100 0 50 0 and 0 1 80 mm respectively adjust the psnp suspensions in the presence of ca2 and na to ph 4 0 and the psnp suspensions in the presence of fe3 to 3 0 to avoid fe3 precipitation hydrodynamic diameter of psnp was measured using a nano laser particle size analyzer zen3600 malvern instruments limited uk after 2 days of shaking psnp with or without na ca2 and fe3 was centrifuged 3000 rpm 20 min then analyze the psnp concentration in the supernatants according to the above method the critical coagulation concentrations ccc of psnp under different electrolyte solutions na ca2 and fe3 were measured using dynamic light scattering dls the details are provided in si 2 5 ftir and 2d cos analysis ftir vetex70 bruker was used to characterize psnp psnp goethite and psnp magnetite complexes to detect the origins of the ir peaks of the samples 2d cos analysis was carried out with 2dshige software shigeaki morita japan the detailed information about 2d cos analysis is provided in the si 2 6

escalab 250xi was used to characterize the change of surface chemical compositions of psnp 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of psnp the morphology of psnp was characterized by sem and the results are displayed in fig 1 a which shows that psnp was in spherical shape with smooth surfaces and an average particle size of 50 nm ftir spectra was performed to analyze the structural and functional groups of psnp fig 1b illustrates that the multiple absorption bands with high intensities were mostly in the region of 2000 1000 cm 1 and 3500 2700 cm 1 peaks at 1666 and 1375 cm 1 were ascribed to the co stretching vibration and c oh tensile zbyszewski et al 2014 respectively those at 1453 1493 and 1601 cm 1 were designated to the aromatic c h structure of psnp kaczmarek et al 2008 and the strong peaks at 1716 cm 1 and 1050 cm 1 are due to the presence of o co and o c o structure liu et al 2019a the chemical compositions of psnp were examined by xps and the results are presented in fig 1c the psnp had five characteristic peaks at 284 27 285 47 286 27 289 67 and 291 67 ev which were attributed to aliphatic c h aromatic c h c o co and o co liu et al 2019b respectively the results are consistent with the ftir data the zeta potentials zp of psnp at different solution phs are illustrated in fig 1d the zp of psnp decreased from 5 mv to 35 mv as the ph increased from 2 0 to 11 0 suggesting that the psnp was negatively charged at phs 2 0 11 0 of all tested solution the colloidal stability experiments indicated that the psnp suspension was very stable in a 10 day duration fig 1e and f 3 2 electrostatic interactions between psnp and the minerals to investigate the interaction of psnp with minerals psnp was incubated with the four minerals individually for 12 h and the suspensions were centrifuged fig 2 a shows the remaining concentration of psnp in the suspensions after incubation with different minerals mag ca mag na goe ca goe na kao ca kao na mon ca or mon na the concentration of psnp in the suspensions of kaolinite and montmorillonite did not change distinctly suggesting that there was negligible interaction between psnp and these two minerals however the psnp concentration decreased by 40 80 as it was incubated with goethite and magnetite suggesting that there were strong interactions between psnp and goethite or magnetite compared with magnetite more psnp was adsorbed by goethite which might be ascribed to a higher surface area for goethite compared to magnetite table s1 in order to more directly understand the interaction characteristics between psnp and the two iron oxides sem and tem were employed to investigate the solids of psnp goethite and psnp magnetite obtained by centrifugation fig 3 the sem and tem images show that goethite was in a nanorod shape while magnetite showed octahedral and diamond shaped dodecahedron structure as psnp was incubated with them the smaller sized psnp was adsorbed on the surface of larger sized goethite or magnetite previous study also reported the adsorption between organics and iron oxides chen et al 2014a the above results suggested that the strong electrostatic attraction might be the dominant force driving psnp to adsorb on the iron oxides to clarify the interactions between psnp and the four minerals the absorbance of the mineral at 800 nm od800 was measured fig 2b when the two modified goethite and magnetite goe ca goe na mag ca and mag na were added to the psnp suspension the od800 of goethite or magnetite was obviously higher than the corresponding value in pure water p 0 05 further indicating that there were strong interactions between psnp and goethite or magnetite in contrast the od800 values of kao na kao ca mon na and mon ca did not change distinctly when incubated with psnp suggesting that the interaction between psnp and montmorillonite or kaolinite was negligible the zp values of the four minerals at different solution phs are displayed in fig s3 in the tested solution phs 2 0 11 0 kaolinite kao na kao ca and montmorillonite mon na mon ca were all negatively charged figs s3a and b however the pzcs of magnetite mag na mag ca and goethite goe na goe ca were around 7 0 7 5 and 8 0 9 0 which are in agreement with the literatures yang et al 2018 zhao et al 2015 goethite had a higher pzc than magnetite indicating a more positively charged surface of goethite the results further certified that the adsorption of psnp on magnetite and goethite were mainly driven by the strong electrostatic attraction between them while the electrostatic repulsion prohibited them from attaching each other to further investigate the electrostatic interaction between psnp and the iron oxides the impact of ph on the attachment was investigated and the results are shown in fig 2c the attachment of psnp with goethite goe na goe ca was significantly stronger than magnetite mag na mag ca the attachment between psnp and the two iron oxides decreased as the ph increased from acidic to alkaline conditions and negligible attachment was observed at ph 9 0 11 0 the zp values of the two iron oxides decreased as the ph increased figs s3c and d similarly the zp of psnp also decreased fig 1d thus the electrostatic attraction between psnp and the two iron oxides decreased as the solution ph increased depressing the attachment between them in order to further verify the important role of electrostatic interaction three other materials with different surface charges namely mno2 al2o3 and sio2 particles were also tested for comparison fig 2d the sio2 particles were negatively charged in the ph range of 2 0 11 0 fig s4 al2o3 had a pzc value of 9 5 and was positively charged at ph 3 0 7 0 and 9 0 fig 2d mno2 had a pzc of 4 5 thus was positively charged at ph 3 0 while negatively charged at 7 0 and 9 0 correspondingly no attachment of psnp was observed for sio2 particles at all the tested ph values fig 2d which was similar to that between psnp and negatively charged kaolinite montmorillonite fig 2a for the positively charged al2o3 remarkable attachment was observed at ph 3 0 7 0 and 9 0 which was in consistent with the situation of the two iron oxides for mno2 particles attachment was only observed at ph 3 0 at which it was positively charged all these results fortified that electrostatic interaction played predominant roles in the stability of psnp in aquatic environment considering that magnetite and goethite particles might release fe e g fe3 fe oh 2 fe oh ions which destabilized the psnp suspension the dissolution of goethite and magnetite particles at ph 3 0 11 0 was measured fig s5 the released fe ions from goethite were in the range of 0 014 0 265 mg l while those released from magnetite particles were in the range of 0 053 0 236 mg l at the tested ph range of 3 0 11 0 the hydrodynamic diameters of psnp in the presence of fe ions were determined fig 4 a on the basis of the hypothesis that the psnp aggregates were spherical the results indicated that large aggregates of psnp would form at 0 005 mm fe3 which is equivalent to 0 28 mg l fig 4b this implies that the released iron ions from goethite and magnetite at the tested experimental conditions did not distinctly induce psnp aggregation in addition compared to fe3 ions the effects of ca2 and na ions were also studied fig 4a and b the ccc of fe3 ca2 and na ions were about 0 005 0 2 and 10 mm respectively the cccs ratios of fe3 na and ca2 na are 3 6 92 and 2 5 64 respectively which were basically in accordance with the schulze hardy rule z 6 rouster et al 2017 these results implied that fe3 was more likely to destabilize psnp than na and ca2 3 3 adsorption isotherms of psnp on goethite and magnetite the adsorption kinetics of psnp on goethite and magnetite are described in fig s2a and the results indicated that the adsorption reached equilibrium in 3 h therefore 12 h was selected to investigate the adsorption isotherms of psnp by the two minerals adsorption isotherms and related fitting parameters of henry freundlich and langmuir models are presented in fig 5 a and table s3 langmuir isotherm has been used to adsorb several organic or inorganic pollutants on the surface of iron oxides watson 2018 langmuir model fit well for the adsorption of psnp on both goethite and magnetite with a high coefficient of determination r 2 0 987 indicating that the adsorption of psnp on goethite and magnetite was nonlinear which was similar to the adsorption of glyphosate on goethite and magnetite yang et al 2018 langmuir model describes a single molecular layer adsorption process which means that adsorption of the psnp pellets on the surface of the iron oxides was a similar covering process for freundlich model the fitting correlation coefficient was greater than 0 928 suggesting the freundlich model might also explain the adsorption trend of psnp on the iron oxide minerals to a certain extent the parameter n was 1 suggesting that the high energy sites were firstly occupied followed by the lower energy sites peruchi et al 2015 the k f values of goethite and magnetite were 49 7 and 12 6 mg kg 1 mg l 1 n respectively indicating that goethite had a greater adsorption ability of psnp than magnetite as shown in fig 5b the adsorption of psnp on goethite after normalized by surface area was still higher than magnetite indicating that other factors might contribute to the adsorption of psnp on iron oxides several previous studies demonstrated that the adsorption of several contaminants on goethite was normally higher than other iron oxides because the hydrogen bonding between the adsorbate and the oh groups on the surface of the iron oxide was critical watson 2018 for instance the bonding between 4 n nonylphenol and hematite or goethite was due to the overlap of the phenol ring of the 4 n nonylphenol with oh on the surface of hematite and goethite watson 2018 the oh groups on the surface of iron oxides may be involved in the interactions between them and psnp schwertmann et al 2000 there were more oh groups on the surface of goethite than magnetite which might be responsible for the higher adsorption of psnp on its surface hanoch et al 2006 watson 2018 3 4 ftir spectra and 2d cos maps of psnp adsorbed on goethite and magnetite in order to further clarify whether the functional groups on the surface of iron oxides played a role in the adsorption process we conducted ftir analysis on the minerals at different time points during the adsorption of psnp on both iron oxides and the results are illustrated in fig 6 a and b the absorption peaks of goethite are produced by the vibration of fe o and fe oh fig 6a the peak at 631 cm 1 was assigned to the fe o stretching vibration of goethite šarić et al 1998 consistent with previous studies the peaks at 887 cm 1 fe oh and 793 cm 1 fe oh are respectively caused by inward and outward bending vibration of goethite 001 side cambier 1986 the spectral peak at 1655 cm 1 could be attributed to the bending vibration of h o h and that in this area is caused by the o h group and the absorbed water in the sample wei and nan 2011 the fe oh stretching vibration was observed at 3111 cm 1 cambier 1986 the above five vibrations were constant during the adsorption process compared to goethite without psnp the band at 1060 cm 1 oh γ feooh schwertmann and cornell 2007 disappeared distinctly after adsorption this phenomenon suggests that oh γ feooh might play an important role in the adsorption of psnp on goethite due to formation of hydrogen bonding the band at 571 cm 1 was due to fe o šarić et al 1998 but this peak was weak fig 6b as for magnetite there was an absorption band at about 1045 cm 1 which is characteristic of oh γ feooh habibi 2014 the characteristic absorption peak at 1624 cm 1 corresponds to the bending vibration of oh in fe oh 2 fe oh 3 or feooh schwertmann and cornell 2007 additionally the bands at 2924 and 3422 cm 1 might be ascribed to the oh stretching vibration of magnetite while that at 2924 cm 1 depends on the morphology of the magnetite particles and that at 3422 cm 1 corresponds to the adsorbed water on magnetite schwertmann and cornell 2007 in general the intensities of the above bonds did not change distinctly during the incubation of psnp with magnetite implying that the hydrogen bonding between them was marginal the results may explain the higher adsorption of psnp on goethite than magnetite in order to better understand the change order of functional groups of psnp adsorbed on goethite with different adsorption durations 2d cos was applied to analyze the ftir data all autopeaks along the diagonal were positive in the synchronous maps fig 6c the cross peaks in the synchronous maps show the frequency band with coupling or correlation origin and the positive sign indicates that the band intensity changes in the same direction while the negative sign indicates the opposite change the results reveal that the main peaks of ftir change simultaneously during the adsorption process six major autopeaks were identified at 631 793 887 1060 1655 3111 cm 1 along the diagonal of goethite when psnp was adsorbed on the goethite the peaks at 1060 cm 1 involving in oh γ feooh had the highest intensity followed by the peaks at 887 and 793 cm 1 fe oh while the band at 3111 cm 1 had the lowest intensity all the cross peaks in the synchronous maps of goethite were positive table s4 indicating that almost all the functional groups had synchronous changes i e the intensity of band decreases during the adsorption according to the rules of noda 2018 the asynchronous correlation spectrum could reveal the changing order of chemical bonds in adsorption process asynchronous mapping is asymmetric relative to the diagonal so automatic peaks are not displayed in fig 6d there were significant differences in the sign of cross peaks of goethite which revealed the reaction sequences of the functional groups the sign of cross peaks in the asynchronous map table s4 represented the sequence of interactions between psnp and goethite as follows oh γ feooh 1060 cm 1 fe oh inward bending vibration 887 cm 1 fe oh outward bending vibration 793 cm 1 fe o stretching vibration 631 cm 1 fe oh stretching vibration 3111 cm 1 h o h bending vibration 1655 cm 1 the sequence further revealed that hydrogen bonding between oh γ feooh of goethite was critical in the adsorption of psnp on goethite which was consistent with the results above 4 conclusions nps have attracted increasing attention due to their potentially greater mobility higher exposure and toxicities to organisms but their interaction with minerals in the environment remains unclear this study improved our understanding on the interactions between nps and several typical minerals kaolinite montmorillonite magnetite goethite which are widely present in the environment and have different surface charges the results showed that the electrostatic attraction played a predominant role in the interactions between psnp and minerals note that psnp did not interact with the negatively charged minerals such as kaolinite and montmorillonite on account of electrostatic repulsion considering that the adsorption capacity between nps and negatively charged minerals is weaker than that between positively charged minerals special attention should be paid to the surface charge when evaluating the behaviors and fates of nps in the environment besides the surface functional groups such as the oh γ feooh in goethite also made vital contribution for the interaction between nps and minerals since iron oxides are widely present in the environment while other metal oxides with positively charges such as al2o3 are widely present in wastewater treatment plants the strong electrostatic attraction between nps and minerals could result in the deposition of nps particles which would highly impact their fates in the wastewater treatment plants and in natural aquatic environment as well as sediments and soils the advantage of this study lies in the combination of ftir spectra and 2d cos to study the adsorption mechanisms between nps and minerals however this article only studied the interactions between the highly charged psnp and minerals many other plastic nanoparticles might bear less charges in addition the plastic particles might be present in the environment in different sizes all these factors might affect the interactions of plastic particles and minerals and should be taken into consideration it should be noted that the natural environment is complex and the influences of other factors such as natural organic matters ionic strength on the environmental transport of nps should be studied in future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

typical minerals including goethite magnetite kaolinite and montmorillonite in aqueous phase were investigated the stability of psnp colloidal suspension decreased in the presence of the positively charged goethite or magnetite while it was not affected by the negatively charged montmorillonite and kaolinite suggesting that there was a strong electrostatic attraction between psnp and the two iron oxides incubation of psnp with other three metal oxides with different surface charges mno2 al2o3 and sio2 confirmed the importance of electrostatic interaction in the stability of psnp suspension the transmission electron microscopy tem analysis and batch adsorption experiments indicated that psnp was effectively adsorbed on goethite or magnetite due to the strong electrostatic attraction between them the fourier transform infrared spectra ftir and two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos analyses indicated that there was strong hydrogen bonding between the oh γ feooh of goethite and psnp contributing to the higher adsorption of psnp on goethite than magnetite these findings shed light on the interactions of psnp with mineral surfaces and potential fate of psnp

main objective of this study is to explore the interactions between nps and minerals in the environment due to the wide application of polystyrene plastics polystyrene nanoplastic psnp was selected as the model of nps alimi et al 2018 the interactions between psnp and several typical minerals kaolinite montmorillonite magnetite goethite which are widely present in the environment and have different surface charges were systematically investigated using batch adsorption experiments ftir 2d cos scanning electron microscopy sem and other characterization methods were applied to reveal the intrinsic interaction mechanisms between them the results provide a reference for further research on migration transformation and degradation of nps 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials steep magnetite sigma aldrich goethite sigma aldrich kaolinite fluka and montmorillonite fluka in 0 5 m cacl2 and nacl solution for 12 h respectively to prepare na and ca saturated minerals repeat the steeping process four times and then wash the minerals with distilled di water until no cl was detected with agno3 solution wang and xing 2005 zhang et al 2012 the ca and na saturated minerals were recorded as kao ca mon ca goe ca mag ca and kao na mon na goe na mag na respectively these na and ca saturated minerals were used to avoid the possible effects of mixed exchangeable cations e g ca2 k and na on the interaction between minerals and psnp all the mineral samples were freeze dried ground and sifted through a 0 15 mm screen the suspension of psnp 20 mg l was obtained by diluting the standard psnp solution purchased from thermo 10000 mg l with di water sonicated for 30 min 20 khz kq 300de shumei and then stored in 4 c refrigerator the concentration of psnp in the suspension was measured by fluorescence spectrophotometer rf 6000 shimadzu japan and the concentration of psnp was calculated using a standard curve with 6 points fig s1 2 2 uv vis absorbance of minerals in the presence of psnp the absorbance of the minerals was measured using a uv vis spectrophotometer genesys 10s uv vis at the wavelength of 800 nm the psnp suspension 20 mg l was sonicated for 5 min 20 khz kq 300de shumei before use subsequently 20 mg of minerals mag ca mag na goe ca goe na kao ca kao na mon ca or mon na were added to a 20 ml vial containing 10 ml of psnp suspension or di water the mixture was shaken in the dark for 2 days 150 rpm 25 c and then set still for 5 h the supernatant 4 ml was carefully removed to measure the absorbance 2 3 adsorption of psnp on the minerals in a preliminary study the minerals were incubated with the psnp suspension and the mixture was centrifuged the minerals could be effectively separated from the suspensions of psnp by centrifuging 3000 rpm 30 min while the psnp suspension after centrifugation remained very stable after sonication 5 min 20 khz this suggested that centrifugation was effective for the separation of minerals in the dispersed psnp suspensions thus the interaction between psnp and minerals might be considered as an adsorption process of psnp on minerals for a typical adsorption experiment add 20 mg of minerals mag ca mag na goe ca goe na kao ca kao na mon ca or mon na to a 20 ml vial containing 10 ml of psnp suspensions 0 10 mg l psnp was sonicated in di water for 5 min 20 khz at 25 c to obtain the psnp suspensions all the vials were shaken in the dark 25 c for 12 h to achieve equilibrium and then centrifuged 3000 rpm 30 min to get rid of the minerals from the psnp suspension after centrifugation remove the supernatant 5 ml carefully to detect the psnp concentration at 468 nm of ex and 508 nm of em using a fluorescence spectrophotometer rf 6000 shimadzu japan the details about the adsorption of psnp on goethite and magnetite and adsorption models are provided in the supporting information si in order to further study the impacts of mineral characters e g size chemical compositions and surface charge on the interactions between psnp and minerals three other mineral particles al2o3 40 50 nm alfa aesar co mno2 50 60 nm acros organics co and sio2 1 5 μm fisher co which are also widely present in natural environment were used as adsorbents all the minerals were cleaned with di water before use the zeta potentials of the three particles as a function of the ph of the suspension the pzcs point of zero charges of the three particles were measured 2 4 release of fe3 from goethite and magnetite and its impact on psnp aggregation the fe ions dissolved from magnetite and goethite at different ph were studied briefly add 10 ml of di water to a vial containing 20 mg of magnetite mag na or goethite goe na the solution ph was adjusted with hno3 and koh to 3 0 11 0 after shaking 150 rpm 2 days the suspension was centrifuged 3000 rpm 30 min and then passed through a teflon filter membrane 0 22 μm the concentration of fe ions in the filtrate was measured utilizing inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms icaprq thermo fisher the effect of fe3 ions on psnp aggregation and sedimentation was studied by comparing with na and ca2 in the freshly prepared psnp suspensions a certain volume of a specific chloride salt solution was introduced to achieve a final psnp concentration of 20 mg l the final concentrations of na ca2 and fe3 in the suspensions were 0 100 0 50 0 and 0 1 80 mm respectively adjust the psnp suspensions in the presence of ca2 and na to ph 4 0 and the psnp suspensions in the presence of fe3 to 3 0 to avoid fe3 precipitation hydrodynamic diameter of psnp was measured using a nano laser particle size analyzer zen3600 malvern instruments limited uk after 2 days of shaking psnp with or without na ca2 and fe3 was centrifuged 3000 rpm 20 min then analyze the psnp concentration in the supernatants according to the above method the critical coagulation concentrations ccc of psnp under different electrolyte solutions na ca2 and fe3 were measured using dynamic light scattering dls the details are provided in si 2 5 ftir and 2d cos analysis ftir vetex70 bruker was used to characterize psnp psnp goethite and psnp magnetite complexes to detect the origins of the ir peaks of the samples 2d cos analysis was carried out with 2dshige software shigeaki morita japan the detailed information about 2d cos analysis is provided in the si 2 6 characterization of psnp and the minerals for both psnp and the minerals the surface areas were determined by n2 adsorption desorption isotherms using an autosorb 1 quantachrome usa morphologies and

zeta potentials of the particles as a function of solution phs using a nano laser particle size analyzer zen3600 malvern instruments limited uk x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps thermo fisher escalab 250xi was used to characterize the change of surface chemical compositions of psnp 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of psnp the morphology of psnp was characterized by sem and the results are displayed in fig 1 a which shows that psnp was in spherical shape with smooth surfaces and an average particle size of 50 nm ftir spectra was performed to analyze the structural and functional groups of psnp fig 1b illustrates that the multiple absorption bands with high intensities were mostly in the region of 2000 1000 cm 1 and 3500 2700 cm 1 peaks at 1666 and 1375 cm 1 were ascribed to the co stretching vibration and c oh tensile zbyszewski et al 2014 respectively those at 1453 1493 and 1601 cm 1 were designated to the aromatic c h structure of psnp kaczmarek et al 2008 and the strong peaks at 1716 cm 1 and 1050 cm 1 are due to the presence of o co and o c o structure liu et al 2019a the chemical compositions of psnp were examined by xps and the results are presented in fig 1c the psnp had five characteristic peaks at 284 27 285 47 286 27 289 67 and 291 67 ev which were attributed to aliphatic c h aromatic c h c o co and o co liu et al 2019b respectively the results are consistent with the ftir data the zeta potentials zp of psnp at different solution phs are illustrated in fig 1d the zp of psnp decreased from 5 mv to 35 mv as the ph increased from 2 0 to 11 0 suggesting that the psnp was negatively charged at phs 2 0 11 0 of all tested solution the colloidal stability experiments indicated that the psnp suspension was very stable in a 10 day duration fig 1e and f 3 2 electrostatic interactions between psnp and the minerals to investigate the interaction of psnp with minerals psnp was incubated with the four minerals individually for 12 h and the suspensions were centrifuged fig 2 a shows the remaining concentration of psnp in the suspensions after incubation with different minerals mag ca mag na goe ca goe na kao ca kao na mon ca or mon na the concentration of psnp in the suspensions of kaolinite and montmorillonite did not change distinctly suggesting that there was negligible interaction between psnp and these two minerals however the psnp concentration decreased by 40 80 as it was incubated with goethite and magnetite suggesting that there were strong interactions between psnp and goethite or magnetite compared with magnetite more psnp was adsorbed by goethite which might be ascribed to a higher surface area for goethite compared to magnetite table s1 in order to more directly understand the interaction characteristics between psnp and the two iron oxides sem and tem were employed to investigate the solids of psnp goethite and psnp magnetite obtained by centrifugation fig 3 the sem and tem images show that goethite was in a nanorod shape while magnetite showed octahedral and diamond shaped dodecahedron structure as psnp was incubated with them the smaller sized psnp was adsorbed on the surface of larger sized goethite or magnetite previous study also reported the adsorption between organics and iron oxides chen et al 2014a the above results suggested that the strong electrostatic attraction might be the dominant force driving psnp to adsorb on the iron oxides to clarify the interactions between psnp and the four minerals the absorbance of the mineral at 800 nm od800 was measured fig 2b when the two modified goethite and magnetite goe ca goe na mag ca and mag na were added to the psnp suspension the od800 of goethite or magnetite was obviously higher than the corresponding value in pure water p 0 05 further indicating that there were strong interactions between psnp and goethite or magnetite in contrast the od800 values of kao na kao ca mon na and mon ca did not change distinctly when incubated with psnp suggesting that the interaction between psnp and montmorillonite or kaolinite was negligible the zp values of the four minerals at different solution phs are displayed in fig s3 in the tested solution phs 2 0 11 0 kaolinite kao na kao ca and montmorillonite mon na mon ca were all negatively charged figs s3a and b however the pzcs of magnetite mag na mag ca and goethite goe na goe ca were around 7 0 7 5 and 8 0 9 0 which are in agreement with the literatures yang et al 2018 zhao et al 2015 goethite had a higher pzc than magnetite indicating a more positively charged surface of goethite the results further certified that the adsorption of psnp on magnetite and goethite were mainly driven by the strong electrostatic attraction between them while the electrostatic repulsion prohibited them from attaching each other to further investigate the electrostatic interaction between psnp and the iron oxides the impact of ph on the attachment was investigated and the results are shown in fig 2c the attachment of psnp with goethite goe na goe ca was significantly stronger than magnetite mag na mag ca the attachment between psnp and the two iron oxides decreased as the ph increased from acidic to alkaline conditions and negligible attachment was observed at ph 9 0 11 0 the zp values of the two iron oxides decreased as the ph increased figs s3c and d similarly the zp of psnp also decreased fig 1d thus the electrostatic attraction between psnp and the two iron oxides decreased as the solution ph increased depressing the attachment between them in order to further verify the important role of electrostatic interaction three other materials with different surface charges namely mno2 al2o3 and sio2 particles were also tested for comparison fig 2d the sio2 particles were negatively charged in the ph range of 2 0 11 0 fig s4 al2o3 had a pzc value of 9 5 and was positively charged at ph 3 0 7 0 and 9 0 fig 2d mno2 had a pzc of 4 5 thus was positively charged at ph 3 0 while negatively charged at 7 0 and 9 0 correspondingly no attachment of psnp was observed for sio2 particles at all the tested ph values fig 2d which was similar to that between psnp and negatively charged kaolinite montmorillonite fig 2a for the positively charged al2o3 remarkable attachment was observed at ph 3 0 7 0 and 9 0 which was in consistent with the situation of the two iron oxides for mno2 particles attachment was only observed at ph 3 0 at which it was positively charged all these results fortified that electrostatic interaction played predominant roles in the stability of psnp in aquatic environment considering that magnetite and goethite particles might release fe e g fe3 fe oh 2 fe oh ions which destabilized the psnp suspension the dissolution of goethite and magnetite particles at ph 3 0 11 0 was measured fig s5 the released fe ions from goethite were in the range of 0 014 0 265 mg l while those released from magnetite particles were in the range of 0 053 0 236 mg l at the tested ph range of 3 0 11 0 the hydrodynamic diameters of psnp in the presence of fe ions were determined fig 4 a on the basis of the hypothesis that the psnp aggregates were spherical the results indicated that large aggregates of psnp would form at 0 005 mm fe3 which is equivalent to 0 28 mg l fig 4b this implies that the released iron ions from goethite and magnetite at the tested experimental conditions did not distinctly induce psnp aggregation in addition compared to fe3 ions the effects of ca2 and na ions were also studied fig 4a and b the ccc of fe3 ca2 and na ions were about 0 005 0 2 and 10 mm respectively the cccs ratios of fe3 na and ca2 na are 3 6 92 and 2 5 64 respectively which were basically in accordance with the schulze hardy rule z 6 rouster et al 2017 these results implied that fe3 was more likely to destabilize psnp than na and ca2 3 3 adsorption isotherms of psnp on goethite and magnetite the adsorption kinetics of psnp on goethite and magnetite are described in fig s2a and the results indicated that the adsorption reached equilibrium in 3 h therefore 12 h was selected to investigate the adsorption isotherms of psnp by the two minerals adsorption isotherms and related fitting parameters of henry freundlich and langmuir models are presented in fig 5 a and table s3 langmuir isotherm has been used to adsorb several organic or inorganic pollutants on the surface of iron oxides watson 2018 langmuir model fit well for the adsorption of psnp on both goethite and magnetite with a high coefficient of determination r 2 0 987 indicating that the adsorption of psnp on goethite and magnetite was nonlinear which was similar to the adsorption of glyphosate on goethite and magnetite yang et al 2018 langmuir model describes a single molecular layer adsorption process which means that adsorption of the psnp pellets on the surface of the iron oxides was a similar covering process for freundlich model the fitting correlation coefficient was greater than 0 928 suggesting the freundlich model might also explain the adsorption trend of psnp on the iron oxide minerals to a certain extent the parameter n was 1 suggesting that the high energy sites were firstly occupied followed by the lower energy sites peruchi et al 2015 the k f values of goethite and magnetite were 49 7 and 12 6 mg kg 1 mg l 1 n respectively indicating that goethite had a greater adsorption ability of psnp than magnetite as shown in fig 5b the adsorption of psnp on goethite after normalized by surface area was still higher than magnetite indicating that other factors might contribute to the adsorption of psnp on iron oxides several previous studies demonstrated that the adsorption of several contaminants on goethite was normally higher than other iron oxides because the hydrogen bonding between the adsorbate and the oh groups on the surface of the iron oxide was critical watson 2018 for instance the bonding between 4 n nonylphenol and hematite or goethite was due to the overlap of the phenol ring of the 4 n nonylphenol with oh on the surface of hematite and goethite watson 2018 the oh groups on the surface of iron oxides may be involved in the interactions between them and psnp schwertmann et al 2000 there were more oh groups on the surface of goethite than magnetite which might be responsible for the higher adsorption of psnp on its surface hanoch et al 2006 watson 2018 3 4 ftir spectra and 2d cos maps of psnp adsorbed on goethite and magnetite in order to further clarify whether the functional groups on the surface of iron oxides played a role in the adsorption process we conducted ftir analysis on the minerals at different time points during the adsorption of psnp on both iron oxides and the results are illustrated in fig 6 a and b the absorption peaks of goethite are produced by the vibration of fe o and fe oh fig 6a the peak at 631 cm 1 was assigned to the fe o stretching vibration of goethite šarić et al 1998 consistent with previous studies the peaks at 887 cm 1 fe oh and 793 cm 1 fe oh are respectively caused by inward and outward bending vibration of goethite 001 side cambier 1986 the spectral peak at 1655 cm 1 could be attributed to the bending vibration of h o h and that in this area is caused by the o h group and the absorbed water in the sample wei and nan 2011 the fe oh stretching vibration was observed at 3111 cm 1 cambier 1986 the above five vibrations were constant during the adsorption process compared to goethite without psnp the band at 1060 cm 1 oh γ feooh schwertmann and cornell 2007 disappeared distinctly after adsorption this phenomenon suggests that oh γ feooh might play an important role in the adsorption of psnp on goethite due to formation of hydrogen bonding the band at 571 cm 1 was due to fe o šarić et al 1998 but this peak was weak fig 6b as for magnetite there was an absorption band at about 1045 cm 1 which is characteristic of oh γ feooh habibi 2014 the characteristic absorption peak at 1624 cm 1 corresponds to the bending vibration of oh in fe oh 2 fe oh 3 or feooh schwertmann and cornell 2007 additionally the bands at 2924 and 3422 cm 1 might be ascribed to the oh stretching vibration of magnetite while that at 2924 cm 1 depends on the morphology of the magnetite particles and that at 3422 cm 1 corresponds to the adsorbed water on magnetite schwertmann and cornell 2007 in general the intensities of the above bonds did not change distinctly during the incubation of psnp with magnetite implying that the hydrogen bonding between them was marginal the results may explain the higher adsorption of psnp on goethite than magnetite in order to better understand the change order of functional groups of psnp adsorbed on goethite with different adsorption durations 2d cos was applied to analyze the ftir data all autopeaks along the diagonal were positive in the synchronous maps fig 6c the cross peaks in the synchronous maps show the frequency band with coupling or correlation origin and the positive sign indicates that the band intensity changes in the same direction while the negative sign indicates the opposite change the results reveal that the main peaks of ftir change simultaneously during the adsorption process six major autopeaks were identified at 631 793 887 1060 1655 3111 cm 1 along the diagonal of goethite when psnp was adsorbed on the goethite the peaks at 1060 cm 1 involving in oh γ feooh had the highest intensity followed by the peaks at 887 and 793 cm 1 fe oh while the band at 3111 cm 1 had the lowest intensity all the cross peaks in the synchronous maps of goethite were positive table s4 indicating that almost all the functional groups had synchronous changes i e the intensity of band decreases during the adsorption according to the rules of noda 2018 the asynchronous correlation spectrum could reveal the changing order of chemical bonds in adsorption process asynchronous mapping is asymmetric relative to the diagonal so automatic peaks are not displayed in fig 6d there were significant differences in the sign of cross peaks of goethite which revealed the reaction sequences of the functional groups the sign of cross peaks in the asynchronous map table s4 represented the sequence of interactions between psnp and goethite as follows oh γ feooh 1060 cm 1 fe oh inward bending vibration 887 cm 1 fe oh outward bending vibration 793 cm 1 fe o stretching vibration 631 cm 1 fe oh stretching vibration 3111 cm 1 h o h bending vibration 1655 cm 1 the sequence further revealed that hydrogen bonding between oh γ feooh of goethite was critical in the adsorption of psnp on goethite which was consistent with the results above 4 conclusions nps have attracted increasing attention due to their potentially greater mobility higher exposure and toxicities to organisms but their interaction with minerals in the environment remains unclear this study improved our understanding on the interactions between nps and several typical minerals kaolinite montmorillonite magnetite goethite which are widely present in the environment and have different surface charges the results showed that the electrostatic attraction played a predominant role in the interactions between psnp and minerals note that psnp did not interact with the negatively charged minerals such as kaolinite and montmorillonite on account of electrostatic repulsion considering that the adsorption capacity between nps and negatively charged minerals is weaker than that between positively charged minerals special attention should be paid to the surface charge when evaluating the behaviors and fates of nps in the environment besides the surface functional groups such as the oh γ feooh in goethite also made vital contribution for the interaction between nps and minerals since iron oxides are widely present in the environment while other metal oxides with positively charges such as al2o3 are widely present in wastewater treatment plants the strong electrostatic attraction between nps and minerals could result in the deposition of nps particles which would highly impact their fates in the wastewater treatment plants and in natural aquatic environment as well as sediments and soils the advantage of this study lies in the combination of ftir spectra and 2d cos to study the adsorption mechanisms between nps and minerals however this article only studied the interactions between the highly charged psnp and minerals many other plastic nanoparticles might bear less charges in addition the plastic particles might be present in the environment in different sizes all these factors might affect the interactions of plastic particles and minerals and should be taken into consideration it should be noted that the natural environment is complex and the influences of other factors such as natural organic matters ionic strength on the environmental transport of nps should be studied in future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

17931,this paper aims to elucidate the role of extracellular polymeric substances eps in regulating anion and cation concentrations and toxicity towards microorganisms in anaerobic granular sludges adapted to low 0 22 m of na and high salinity 0 87 m of na the ion exchange properties of eps were studied with a novel approach where eps were entangled with an inert binder pvdf hfp to form a membrane and characterized in an electrodialysis cell with a mixture of nacl and kcl salts the eps membrane was shown to act as a cation exchange membrane cem with a current efficiency of 80 meaning that eps do not behave as ideal cem surprisingly the membrane had selectivity for transport of k compared to na with a separation factor s k na of 1 3 these properties were compared to a layer prepared from a model compound of eps alginate and a commercial cem the alginate layer had a similar current efficiency 80 but even higher s k na of 1 9 while the commercial cem did not show selectivity towards k or na but exhibited the highest current efficiency of 92 the selectivity of eps and alginate towards k transport has interesting potential applications for ion separation from water streams and should be further investigated the anion repelling and cation binding properties of eps in hydrated and dehydrated granules were further confirmed with microscopy sem edx epifluorescence and ion chromatography icp oes ic techniques results of specific methanogenic activity sma tests conducted with 0 22 and 0 87 m na adapted granular sludges and with various monovalent salts suggested that ions which are preferentially transported by eps are also more toxic towards methanogenic cells graphical abstract image 1 keywords ion selectivity ion transport anaerobic granular sludge eps methanogenic activity 1 introduction in anaerobic wastewater treatment systems high monovalent salt concentrations are considered to negatively affect microbial activity especially of the methanogenic population rinzema et al 1988 vyrides et al 2010 fang et al 2011 de vrieze et al 2016 it was only recently shown that anaerobic granules adapted to approximately 0 35 m na can increase in size gagliano et al 2017 and can even be formed from dispersed biomass sudmalis et al 2018a at na concentrations as high as 0 87 m while maintaining high methanogenic activity for successful high rate anaerobic reactor operation this high methanogenic activity could in part be explained by production of osmolytes by the dominant methanogens allowing to balance the osmotic pressure between the microbial cells and the bulk liquid sudmalis et al 2018b the toxic effect of highly saline environments on anaerobic microbial consortia has mainly been attributed to cations rather than anions mccarty and mckinney 1961 kugelman and mccarty 1965 lin and chen 1999 karri et al 2006 lefebvre et al 2007 altaş 2009 fang et al 2011 and has been explained by various mechanisms i

that produce reactive oxygen species and by interference with membrane transport processes harrison et al 2007 chen et al 2014 in anaerobic granular sludge microorganisms are entangled in a matrix of extracellular polymeric substances eps forming a dense spherical biofilm structure zhou et al 2006 seviour et al 2012 extracellular polymeric substances generally have a net negative charge liu and fang 2003 ajao et al 2018 which enables them to adsorb multivalent heavy metals toner et al 2005 comte et al 2006b comte et al 2008 d abzac et al 2013 li and yu 2014 dobrowolski et al 2017 sorption of monovalent cations by eps of pure cultures of marine bacteria has also been shown while the eps of halomonas sp were shown to poorly adsorb monovalent cations gutierrez et al 2012 the eps of pseudoalteromonas have a high affinity towards k sorption gutierrez et al 2008 due to ability of cation sorption eps can alleviate toxicity of low concentrations mg l range of metals towards microorganisms teitzel and parsek 2003 harrison et al 2007 flemming and wingender 2010 wang et al 2013 by binding and coordination reactions between the metals and the negatively charged functional groups of eps which prevents their diffusion into the deeper parts of the biofilm teitzel and parsek 2003 horn and morgenroth 2006 hu et al 2007 a recent microscopy study of our group has shown that mannose rich eps surrounding methanogenic cells in high salinity adapted granular sludge adsorb high concentrations of sodium gagliano et al 2018 these results suggest that even at high salinity eps may have a protective role against monovalent cations such as na by hindering their diffusion into microbial cells gagliano et al 2018 at high concentrations 0 2 m cl has been reported to cause toxicity to aerobic acidophilic microorganisms because the flux of cl into microbial cells alters the intracellular ph suzuki et al 1999 in general anions are typically reported to be less toxic for anaerobic microorganisms than cations however no attempts to explain this lower toxicity seem to have been reported in principle anions and cations both contribute to osmotic pressure in water smith et al 2016 and therefore microorganisms should have a strategy to cope with high concentrations of either of them theoretically the negative charge of eps should prevent or hinder the transport of anions to microbial cells thereby lowering their toxicity towards the microorganisms present in porous biofilm structures such as sludge granules however this ability of eps to partially repel anions has not been experimentally demonstrated thus far only few studies focused on the transport rather than sorption of monovalent ions e g k na cl in eps layers in one study siegrist and gujer 1985 experimentally determined the diffusion coefficients of br and na in a heterogeneous biofilm and found that these values were smaller compared to their diffusion coefficients in water additionally the diffusion coefficient of br in biofilm was slightly higher compared to na in another study horn and morgenroth 2006 studied the diffusion of nacl and nano3 in biofilms but the transport of individual ionic species could not be distinguished because conductivity rather than individual ion concentrations was measured in the current study the distribution of monovalent ions k na and cl was investigated in microbial granules adapted to 0 87 m and 0 22 m of na initial results indicated that cl is repelled from the granular sludge by eps surrounding the microorganisms to verify this the ion exchange nature of eps was investigated this was done with a novel approach where eps extracted from anaerobic granular sludge were used to fabricate eps layers eps membranes and these were tested in an electrodialysis cell for transport of k na and cl finally to study if the ions with the highest transport rate would also more negatively affect methanogenic activity the effect of different concentrations of na and k towards specific methanogenic activity sma of 0 87 m and 0 22 m na adapted granular sludge was determined 2 materials and methods 2 1 source of anaerobic granular sludge anaerobic granular sludge was obtained from laboratory scale upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactors the reactors were operated at na concentrations of 0 22 r5 and 0 87 r20 m as described in sudmalis et al 2018a 2 2 ion distribution and concentration within salt adapted granular sludge 2 2 1 scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy sem edx samples of granules for sem edx analysis were prepared with a modified procedure described in ismail et al 2010 the modifications included dehydration with graded series 10 30 50 70 and two times 100 of ethanol instead of acetone and sputter coating with tungsten instead of platinum tungsten was chosen for sputter coating due to its lower grain size compared to platinum and therefore possibility for imaging at higher magnifications bell et al 1987 echlin 2009 the granules were imaged at an acceleration voltage of 10 kv and a beam current of 0 4 na at room temperature in a field emission scanning electron microscope magellan 400 fei company oregon usa equipped with energy dispersive x ray detector the images were processed using aztec software oxford instruments 2 2 2 ion concentration in hydrated granular sludge approximately 20 g of sludge samples for determination of ion concentrations in hydrated granular sludge were taken directly from r5 and r20 through a sampling port located 7 5 cm from the bottom of the reactor columns with a total column height of 65 cm for ionic composition measurements of hydrated granular sludge the sludge was first separated from the liquid phase by centrifugation at 10000 xg and 4 c for 15 min further the sludge samples were carefully homogenised with a spatula and two samples approximately 0 5 g each of homogenised solids were taken for microwave digestion ethos 1 advanced microwave digestion labstation milestone s r l italy with 10 ml of 65 hno3 for analysis emsure iso digested samples were brought up to 50 ml with mili q water and further diluted for analysis as a blank for ionic composition of solids mili q was treated in the same way as the samples the supernatant after centrifugation was filtered through 0 2 μm cellulose acetate membrane filter vwr syringe filters and diluted with mili q for further analysis the filtered supernatant from this point forward will be referred to as the bulk liquid throughout the manuscript measurements of bulk liquid were made in one replicate to confirm the expected bulk liquid concentrations of ions differences between measurements and expected values were below 2 in all cases additionally to elucidate the cation exchange properties of eps in sludge granules the distribution of cl na and k in granules of r20 upon granular sludge exposure to equimolar k 0 87 m concentration was investigated to do this 1 g of r20 granular sludge was immersed in 1l of a modified nahco3 and nacl replaced with khco3 and kcl respectively nutrient medium of r20 sudmalis et al 2018a for 24 h before analysis of ionic composition with sample preparation as described above a period of 24 h for ion exchange was chosen to ensure that an equilibrium between the sludge granules and the modified nutrient medium is reached as a control r20 granular sludge was also exposed to its original medium containing 0 87 m of na sudmalis et al 2018a analysis of na and k was carried out by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes varian australia as described in gagliano et al 2018 chloride content was measured on dionex ics 2100 ion chromatography system breda the netherlands equipped with a dionex ionpac as19 column 4 250 mm and data were processed with chromeleon 6 80 sr13 software the results are presented on weight bases mmolion gmedium and mmolion gwet sludge to prevent introduction of errors due to differences in the density of the medium and the granular sludge 2 3 ion exchange properties of eps 2 3 1 extraction and purification of eps extracellular polymeric substances eps were extracted from granular sludge adapted to 0 87 m of na r20 by using an alkaline extraction method as reported by felz et al 2016 in short 3 g of granular sludge wet weight were put into a 0 5 w v na2co3 solution heated to 80 c and stirred at 400 rpm for 35 min after extraction the cell debris and insoluble fraction of the extract were separated by centrifugation at 4000 xg and 4 c for 20 min finally the eps solution was dialysed snakeskin 3 5k mwco against milli q for 24 h to obtain purified eps in a dry state the eps solution was further lyophilised at 84 c and 0 001 mbar 2 3 2 fabrication of alginate gel layers alg membranes extracellular polymeric substances are a mixture of proteins polysaccharides nucleic acids amyloids lipids and glycoproteins with proteins and polysaccharides often being the main constituents of eps seviour et al 2019 amongst all of these constituents alginate and alginate alike molecules anionic polysaccharides are frequently reported to be found in pure cultures of microbial cells as well as in microbial aggregates körstgens et al 2001 lin et al 2009 2010 flemming and wingender 2010 therefore alginate layers were prepared as a control for comparison of their ion exchange properties with layers prepared by using the eps extracted from granular sludge the alginate gel layers alg membranes were casted with an external gelation method adapted from li et al 2015 in following steps i dissolving the polymer in 10 ml milli q ii degassing the solution for 24 h at 4 c iii casting the solution on a petri dish id 5 7 cm and drying at 40 c in a levelled oven iv crosslinking the casted layers in a 2 w v calcium chloride solution with 30 v v of ethanol for casting a mixture of 0 4 g of sodium alginate sa and 0 004 g of guar gum gg as a plasticiser were used resulting in 0 016 g sa cm2 the resulting membrane was washed with demi water and equilibrated in a solution with 10 mm nacl and 10 mm kcl for 8 h before ion selectivity tests 2 3 3 fabrication of layers with eps eps membranes first a polymeric solution was prepared by dissolving poly vinylidene fluoride co hexafluoropropene pvdf hfp in dimethyl acetamide dmac in a ratio 1 9 5 w v for 3 h at 80 c then a weighed amount of eps was dispersed in the polymeric solution and the materials were blended in a ball mill for 4 h the resulting mixture contained 70 30 wt ratio of pvdf hfp to eps the mixture was cast onto a glass plate at 50 c until complete evaporation of the solvent the resulting layer eps membrane was washed with demi water and equilibrated in a solution with 10 mm nacl and 10 mm kcl for 8 h before ion selectivity tests the content of eps in the eps membrane was approximately 0 0027 g eps cm2 of dry membrane this was calculated from the total area of the membrane by assuming a uniform eps distribution 2 3 4 confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm for visualisation of eps distribution in the polymeric binder pvdf hfp to visualize the eps distribution in the eps membranes the membranes were first equilibrated in a buffer solution 10 mm kcl and 10 mm nacl overnight for the staining of the protein fraction of eps the eps membranes were placed in pbs 1x and sypro ruby invitrogen molecular probes usa for 1 h in the dark finally the membranes were washed with the buffer solution and immediately observed under clsm to guarantee that sypro ruby does not stain pvdf hfp a pure pvdf hfp membrane was processed in the same way as eps membranes before the clsm analysis autofluorescence of pvdf hfp was tested as described in appendix 1 microscopy analysis was performed with an inverted axioobserver zeiss lsm 880 clsm carl zeiss germany with a 40 1 3 oil dic m27 plan apochromat objective lens autofluorescence of pvdf hfp in the membranes was visualised with 488 nm excitation wavelength at a maximum emission of 510 nm sypro ruby signal was visualised with 458 nm excitation wavelength at a maximum emission of 656 nm the argon laser was set to 1 power for both excitation wavelengths a series of z axis images 212 5 μm 212 5 μm x 70 μm were generated by optical sectioning with a slice thickness of 1 μm maximum projection intensity and orthogonal 3d reconstruction were generated with zen blue software zen imaging software zeiss germany the choice of emission wavelengths and the dye for eps protein staining is explained in detail in appendix 1 2 3 5 electrochemical characterization and ion selectivity performance of the layers as ion exchange membranes was evaluated in a six compartment electrodialysis cell as shown in fig 1 different membranes separated the compartments inside the cell i the membrane under investigation placed in between compartments a and b this membrane was either eps membrane alg membrane or a commercial membrane neosepta cmx astom corporation tokyo japan used as a comparison ii commercial ion exchange membranes i e neosepta amx and cmx which separated the other compartments characterization of the membranes was done with a solution containing a mixture of two different monovalent cations i e k and na as chloride salts allowing for direct comparison of monovalent ion transport through the membranes in multi ion solutions before each experiment all membranes were equilibrated in a mixed cation solution 10 mm nacl 10 mm kcl for 8 h which allows any weakly adsorbed ion to diffuse to the bulk solution and the exchange of some na for k compartments a b and c were filled with a solution containing 10 mm nacl and 10 mm kcl whereas compartments d were filled with 0 1 m na2so4 solution compartments a and b were filled with 130 ml solutions that were continuously stirred for compartments c and d 1l solutions were circulated at a flow rate of 170 ml min to keep the ion concentrations constant throughout the experiment a current density of 10 a m2 was applied to the cell for 1 h samples from compartments a and b were taken over time and ion concentration was measured by ion chromatography an increase in chloride concentration was calculated from compartment a whereas increases in sodium and potassium concentration were calculated from compartment b ion selectivity s in the membranes is based on the concentration changes between potassium and sodium and is given by eq 1 s k na δ c k δ c na and eq 2 δ c c t c initial where t c initial and c t are the sampling time the initial concentration and the concentration at time t measured in compartment b respectively the ability of the membrane to allow the transport of only one type of ion cations or anions the permselectivity was characterized as current efficiency η eq 3 η i i 2 c t i c initial i v cell f i t where subscript i refers to cation species in solution i e potassium and sodium v cell is the volume of liquid in compartment b l f is faraday s constant 96485 c mol i is the applied current a and t is time s the current efficiency gives an indication on how selectively ions are transported across the membrane sadrzadeh and mohammadi 2009 i e it indicates if the ionic current is mainly transported by potassium and sodium cation exchange membrane or the membranes also allow the transport of chloride 2 4 effect of anions and cations on specific methanogenic activity to study the effect of monovalent anions and cations on specific methanogenic activity sma of salt adapted granular sludge batch experiments in 118 ml serum bottles at a working volume of 50 ml 120 rpm mixing speed and 35 c were performed the vss concentration was set to 1 g l and the cod vss ratio was 4 1 w w sodium acetate was used as the electron donor and carbon source the sma was calculated through measurements of pressure build up curves with a pressure meter equipped with an absolute pressure probe gmh3151 greisinger electronic germany the biogas composition at the end of experiments was measured as described in steinbusch et al 2008 unless stated otherwise the experiments were performed in triplicate all results were corrected for the atmospheric pressure and pressure build up in blank experiments without added acetate the first set of experiments was performed to study the sma of granular sludge adapted to 0 22 r5 and 0 87 r20 m of na when exposed to equimolar concentration of cations by addition of nabr kcl and kbr the second set of experiments was performed to study the sma of r5 granular sludge upon exposure to hyper salinity shocks i e an abrupt increase of salinity by spiking a nutrient medium with increased ion concentration of nacl nabr kcl and kbr the final cation concentration in these experiments was 0 43 m bromide salts were tested nabr and kbr to investigate if different anions at very high salinity would also have a substantial effect on sma as is frequently reported for cations kugelman and mccarty 1965 lefebvre et al 2007 fang et al 2011 all experiments contained 0 08 m of na originating from inocula and sodium acetate as a carbon source this was taken into account when calculating the desired concentration of cations in the experiments the nutrient medium was the same as reported earlier sudmalis et al 2018b nacl nabr kcl and kbr salt amounts were calculated to reach the desired cation concentration for each experiment 3 results 3 1 equilibrium of sodium chloride and potassium in granules at different salinities the measured ion concentrations fig 2 and distributions fig 4 in the anaerobic salt adapted granular sludges show high affinity of eps towards cations compared to anions fig 2 a b show the na and cl concentrations in the bulk liquid and in granular sludges of r5 and r20 respectively sodium concentration in the granular sludge was 0 24 0 004 0 24 m and 0 71 0 01 0 71 m mmol gwet sludge in r5 and r20 respectively the na concentration in r5 granular sludge was 9 higher compared to the bulk liquid whereas in r20 it was 17 lower compared to the bulk liquid the cl concentration was 0 11 0 002 0 11 m and 0 52 0 001 0 52 m mmol gwet sludge in r5 and r20 respectively fig 2 a b these concentrations correspond to a 31 2 and 35 8 lower cl concentration compared to the bulk liquid in r5 and r20 respectively thus apparently eps of granular sludge acclimated to 0 22 and 0 87 m of na preferentially repel anions such as cl probably due to anionic nature of eps as will be discussed in more detail in section 4 1 potassium concentration in the r20 granular sludge before changing the medium was 0 05 mmol gwet sludge 0 02 g gsludge vs fig 3 this corresponds to a 28 fold increase compared to the growth medium such a high concentration of k can be found within methanogenic cells upon exposure to high osmotic stress even after accumulation of osmolytes within the microbial cells sowers and gunsalus 1995 when placing the r20 granules previously exposed to 0 87 m na in a nutrient medium with k 0 87 m the cl concentration in the granular sludge did not change fig 3 however na had almost completely been displaced with k within 24 h fig 3 this indicates a cation exchange nature of eps in the anaerobic granular sludge after the medium change the k concentration within the granular sludge reached a concentration of 0 81 0 04 mmol gwet sludge 0 32 g gsludge vs which is higher compared to the na concentration of 0 73 0 002 mmol gwet sludge in the control sample this shows a higher eps sorption capacity of k in granular sludge compared to na at a given molarity scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy sem edx of sliced microbial granules adapted to 0 87 m of na showed a uniform distribution of na ions throughout the granules fig 4 a confirming the ionic composition results in fig 2 in contrast to the ion chromatography results fig 2 cl could not be detected in the granules with sem edx imaging fig 4 b this could be a result of cl ions removal together with water from the pores of the granular sludge during the dehydration steps of the sem samples preparation see materials and methods this removal of cl coupled with na retention in the granules suggests that na was bound to the eps whereas chloride was mainly present in the water phase of the granule pores as will be further discussed in section 4 2 the binding of na to eps was further verified via fluorescent corona red na staining on r5 and r20 hydrated granules appendix 4 microscopy analysis confirmed the presence of na in the eps matrix surrounding granules fig s4 while the quantification of the corona red signal emission of r5 and r20 granules cells appendix 4 showed that the average intracellular na concentration was in the range 55 66 mm in both granules these results confirmed the binding properties of such eps towards na 3 2 the ion exchange properties of eps membrane and alg membrane the clsm analysis showed that binding of eps with pvdf hfp was successful fig 5 a c with a uniform distribution of eps in red stained with sypro ruby as a thin layer on the surface of the pvdf hfp in green such a distribution is likely due to the hydrophobic nature of pvdf hfp which could only interact with the hydrophobic moieties of otherwise largely hydrophilic eps and did not allow for penetration of eps in the depth of the membrane the negative control staining fig 5 b d confirmed that sypro ruby does not bind to pvdf hfp membranes and that the signal in fig 5 a c indeed originated from sypro ruby bound to proteinaceous fraction of eps after successful preparation of the membranes as shown in fig 5 a c their selectivity towards transport of k na and cl was tested in an electrodialysis cell fig 6 i ii and iii show changes in k and na concentration in compartment b and of cl concentration in compartment a for the alg membrane eps membrane and the commercial membrane respectively cations were preferentially transported across the membranes whereas cl ions were partially repelled in addition a preferential transport of k over na across the alg and eps membrane was measured fig 6 i ii the rate of change in ion concentration determined by the slopes of the curves m value shows that in the alg membrane the k transport was 11 higher and na transport was 23 lower than in the eps membrane the resulting potassium selectivity s k na 1 is depicted in fig 6 iv and was higher for the alg membrane compared to eps membrane with the commercial ion exchange membrane there was no markedly difference in the transport between k and na fig 6 iii iv in fig 6 iv the current efficiency shows how much of the current was transported by cations despite the non ideal cation selectivity of the bio membranes the current efficiency was relatively high 79 for the alg membrane and 83 for the eps membrane the commercial membrane gave the highest current efficiency of 92 3 3 effect of anions and cations on specific methanogenic activity fig 7 a shows that exposure of 0 22 m na adapted granular sludge to equimolar concentration of kcl and kbr salts resulted in a decrease of methanogenic activity by 25 3 and 11 7 respectively when compared to the reference at 0 22 m of na doubling the ion concentration to 0 43 m of kcl and kbr resulted in sma decrease by 49 2 and 44 1 respectively the negative effect of na salts on the sma of granular sludge at increased molarity of 0 43 m was considerably less pronounced compared to k salts fig 7 a the sma decreased by 19 9 and 11 1 with nacl and nabr salts respectively it seems that in general br salts had a slightly smaller negative effect on sma compared to cl salts fig 7 a however the results obtained with nabr at 0 22 m fig 7 a did not follow the overall trend therefore additional experiments are needed in the future to confirm this finally the 0 87 m na adapted granular sludge could retain its methanogenic activity when exposed to equimolar concentration of nabr fig 7 b nabr had no clear negative effect on the sma whereas 0 87 m of k salts resulted in complete loss of methanogenic activity overall the results of the sma tests clearly show that at equimolar concentrations of monovalent salts the methanogenic activity of salt nacl adapted granular sludge was more influenced by changing the cations na to k than by changing the anions cl to br 4 discussion 4 1 cation exchange membrane properties of eps and potassium selectivity in one of our previous studies mannose rich eps of anaerobic granular sludge adapted to high salinity was shown to bind na gagliano et al 2018 the current results further demonstrate that the eps matrix of granules grown at 0 22 r5 and 0 87 m of na r20 is indeed able to retain high na concentrations figs 2 and 4 and fig s4 even though the sodium concentration in granules of r20 was lower compared to the bulk liquid fig 2 it is worth noticing that the granules in r5 contained considerably less na approx 3 times compared to r20 granules sorption behaviour of eps can be characterized by freundlich and or langmuir sorption isotherms as reported by dobrowolski et al 2017 thus such differences can be explained by the fact that in r20 potentially the maximum eps na sorption capacity was reached while it was not the case in r5 granules it is also not excluded that these maximum sorption capacities differ in r5 and r20 because it is known that as a response to a high salinity the chemical composition of eps in anaerobic sludges changes in time vyrides and stuckey 2009 in fact we have recently shown that the eps glycoconjugate composition of granules grown under the same conditions as r5 is different compared to those grown under conditions as in r20 gagliano et al 2018 it is not clear whether the na sorption capacity of r5 and r20 granules was similar from the start however experiments in continuously operated uasb reactors where the influent of r5 was exchanged with r20 for a period of two weeks showed that the new ion equilibria became very similar i e na and cl concentration in r5 granules became very comparable to r20 granules and vice versa appendix 5 this is an interesting result because it shows that anaerobic granules grown under very different salt conditions reach very similar cation and anion equilibria upon exposure to new environmental conditions when these eps were extracted from r20 granules and entangled in a layer with an inert binder pvdf hfp these layers behaved as cation exchange membranes cem i e partially repelled anions such as cl and selectively transported cations such as k and na fig 6 i ii this is probably the result of the abundant presence of different negatively charged functional groups such as carboxylic phenolic and phosphoric groups in eps d abzac et al 2013 the same cem ability was shown also for the alg membranes most likely because of abundance of negatively charged carbonyl groups at neutral ph in alginate nestle and kimmich 1996 lee and mooney 2012 the eps and alg membranes were not fully cation selective fig 6 since the transport of cations na and k represented 80 of the total ionic current fig 6 iv thus 20 of the ionic current can be attributed to transport of cl such non ideal cation exchange nature of eps would be desirable from a microbial perspective because ideal behaviour would prevent diffusion of important substrates such as phosphate or acetate to the microbial cells from a physical chemical perspective some transport of anions such as cl through eps membranes and alginate membranes is expected due to their hydrogel nature hydrogels are known for their hydrophilic structure and hence high sensitivity to water high water uptake leading to swelling or even dissolution lee and mooney 2012 ahmed 2015 the swelling in the membranes can create non selective paths channels for ion k na and cl passage this is due to decrease of charge density caused by swelling in a membrane with a fixed amount of charges such decreased charge density may lead to decreased ion functional group interactions optical coherence tomography oct analysis appendix 2 showed that a hydrated pvdf hfp membrane was 50 μm thick while addition of 10 w w eps increased the membrane thickness by 89 μm clearly showing that swelling of eps indeed took place surprisingly the eps and particularly the alg membrane were more selective to k than to na fig 6 iv such selectivity was not measured in the commercial membrane fig 6 iv and is known to be difficult to achieve with commercial membranes in general luo et al 2018 it is not clear which eps and alginate properties resulted in such a selectivity the low transport of na compared to k across the membranes may be related to several factors such as i steric effects due to the higher hydrated size of na 3 58 å than k 3 31 å nightingale 1959 ii strong interactions e g adsorption between na and the functional groups in the membranes mubita et al 2020 and iii the initial na k ratio in the membranes these factors certainly should be further looked into it should also be noted that while the overall cation exchange properties of eps repulsion of anions and transport of cations were unlikely to be significantly altered due to the harsh alkaline extraction method used in this study comparison of e g figs 2 and 6 it is known that different extraction methods can result in e g different metal binding ability capacity of heavy metals comte et al 2006a d abzac et al 2010 thus in future studies the eps membranes should be prepared with eps extracted with various extraction methods because transport properties of individual cations may also be potentially affected depending on the extraction procedure used the current efficiency of alg membrane was very similar to that of the eps membrane fig 6 iv measurements of charge density show a markedly difference between alginate and eps appendix 3 in principle membranes with high charge density favour the conductivity of counter ions geise et al 2013 alginate had a charge density of 7 0 meq g and eps a charge density of 2 5 meq g as measured for free dissolved polymers in solution these values may be significantly different in the membranes themselves due to charge shielding in alg membranes the crosslinking with calcium ions may have led to a reduction of charged functional groups available for ion exchange in the eps membranes some functional groups may have been completely embedded in the matrix of the supporting polymers pdvf hfp therefore in future studies the real charge densities in the membranes themselves should be assessed for example by acid base titration hosseini et al 2012 4 2 methanogenic activity inhibition by various ions the methanogenic activity of 0 87 m na adapted granular sludge was completely inhibited when this sludge was exposed to equimolar concentrations of k fig 7 b also exposure of 0 22 m na adapted granular sludge to 0 22 m of k led to a 25 decrease in methanogenic activity the decrease of sma was smaller 19 9 when exposing the same granular sludge to 0 43 m na fig 7 a kugelman and mccarty 1965 showed that k had a stronger negative effect on methanogenic activity than na using low salinity adapted sludge and equimolar concentrations of sodium and potassium bicarbonate our results extend this finding with cl salts and high salinity adapted sludge and demonstrate that anions at equimolar concentrations have little influence on the sma fig 7 the mechanism of a potential br or cl toxicity on methanogens is not known possibly anion toxicity is masked by the ability of eps to repel these anions as was shown in this study figs 2 figure 3 fig 6 this masking would occur if granular structure could be viewed upon as a cation exchange membrane fig 8 appendix 3 the concentration of ions in membranes is determined by the concentration of fixed charged functional groups in it and meets the requirement of electroneutrality according to the following equation galama et al 2013 eq 4 c c o u n t e r i o n c c o i o n x 0 where c counter ion is the concentration of the ion with the charge opposite to the functional groups of the membrane cations in the case of eps c co ion is the concentration of ions with the same charge as the functional groups of a membrane anions in the case of eps and x is the concentration of charged functional groups negative for eps due to the fixed negative charges of eps with a concentration x the concentration of negatively charged co ions in the porous granular structure can potentially be reduced while positively charged counterions are allowed to accumulate fig 8 the extent to which the amount of co ions is reduced in the granular structure compared to the bulk liquid depends on x due to the fixation of the charged functional groups in eps and their interaction with cations the osmotic pressure experienced by the microbial cells can be reduced this was partially proven in this study by evaluating the na content of methanogenic cells after fluorescent staining appendix 4 which was much lower than the surrounding medium 66 mm intracellular versus 0 87 m extracellularly this hypothesis can potentially be further tested with eps deficient mutants of methanogens in toxicity experiments and by comparing their sensitivity to different anions with eps covered methanogens such an approach has been used by wang et al 2013 to study the role of eps in osmo protection upon exposure of klebsiella pneumoniae to 100 mm of cacl2 this showed that in eps deficient microbial cells the turgor pressure decreased upon exposure to salt whereas in cells covered with eps the turgor pressure remained unaffected this suggests that eps helps to counteract the osmotic pressure experienced by microbial cells in high salinity environments the mechanism by which high k concentrations inhibit methanogenic activity is not exactly known toxicity studies with high concentrations of metallic cations and other types of microorganisms demonstrated interference with membrane transport processes either by competitively inhibiting membrane transporter proteins or by affecting the membrane potential harrison et al 2007 acetoclastic methanogens couple na transport across the cytoplasmic membrane with the transfer of the methyl group from tetrahydrosarcinapterin h4spt to coenzyme m hs com this precedes the final reduction step for methane production from acetate welte and deppenmeier 2014 also acetoclastic methanogens make use of both proton and na gradients across the cell membrane for atp synthesis welte and deppenmeier 2014 abrupt exposure of the microorganisms to high concentrations of k could potentially interfere with these processes prolonged periods more than a month of exposure can result in adaptation of methanogens to k concentrations of up to 0 19 m chen and cheng 2007 however further increases of k concentration in completely stirred continuously operated tank reactor resulted in decreasing methanogenic activity similar to results of batch experiments in this study chen and cheng 2007 this suggests that adaptation of methanogens to high k concentration is more difficult than adaptation to na albeit the lower na toxicity compared to k may be related to decreased ability of eps to bind k as shown in this study such direct interpretation should still be performed with care firstly as discussed in section 4 1 the eps properties to transport or bind cations may change as a result of the extraction method applied secondly the ion selectivity can be different for sorption compared to transport epsztein et al 2019 in principle this means that the higher k over na sorption capacity of granules shown in fig 3 should not be directly translated to ion transport properties of unextracted eps thirdly microbial cell membranes contain a high ubiquity of ion transporters martin et al 1999 and these are expected to also play an important role in regulating the ion exchange between the surrounding environment and the cytoplasm of microbial cells finally microbial cells can accumulate compatible solutes to balance osmotic pressure between the cells and the surrounding environment martin et al 2000 roberts 2005 sudmalis et al 2018b thus the eps as shown in fig 8 can only be viewed as one out of several protective mechanisms 4 3 can the eps membranes be applied for separation of sodium and potassium in practice separation of two monovalent cations is a serious challenge even for the most advanced electro membrane processes such as electrodialysis this is because these ions possess similar physicochemical properties e g hydrated size most state of the art ion exchange membranes lack selectivity for one specific ion luo et al 2018 with the mimicked bio membranes alg and eps membranes as prepared in this study a relatively high selectivity towards potassium over sodium s k na 1 was observed particularly for the alg membrane such selectivity was absent in a commercial cation exchange membrane fig 6 iv however the membranes prepared in this study cannot be considered for commercial application at this stage due to their limited stability approximately 48 h exposure of membranes to water leads to visible eps detachment from the pvdf eps membrane and to water leakage in the alg membrane data not shown in the eps membrane this is likely due to weak adhesion between eps hydrophilic with hydrophobic moieties and pvdf hydrophobic whereas in the alg membrane this is likely due to ca2 exchange with na leading to disintegration of 3d structure of the gel lee and mooney 2012 future studies need to focus on the eps and sodium alginate properties that dictate the selective transport of k over na which may help to develop analogous synthetic membranes such investigations should include fractionation of eps extracts in their constituents and also preparation of membranes with eps model constituents other than alginate e g proteins and glycoproteins to elucidate how these affect the membrane transport properties 5 concluding remarks and outlook to date only few studies have focused on transport of cations and anions through eps layers of microbial biofilms probably due to a lack of relatively simple methods in this study an electrochemical method with use of eps based membranes was shown to be effective in characterizing selectivity of eps towards transport of monovalent ions an unexpected result of this study was the selective transport of k over na through eps layers in an electrochemical cell despite the fact that the membranes as prepared in this study are of insufficient stability for commercial applications the underlying mechanism for such selectivity should still be further investigated a mechanistic understanding of k selectivity in eps layers could potentially lead to development of commercial membranes to treat e g green house water finally while in literature eps are sometimes mentioned as a potential protective barrier for microorganisms against high salinity mechanistic explanations on how exactly eps would be protective are scarcely reported the cation exchange nature of eps together with the ionic composition measurements of granular sludge in which considerably smaller amounts of cl were measured compared to the bulk liquid suggest that eps of the granules function as a protective barrier against anions in addition the cation interaction with the negatively charged functional groups of eps could further alleviate salt toxicity by lowering the osmotic pressure sensed by the microorganisms the suggested mechanism should be further explored declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

17931,this paper aims to elucidate the role of extracellular polymeric substances eps in regulating anion and cation concentrations and toxicity towards microorganisms in anaerobic granular sludges adapted to low 0 22 m of na and high salinity 0 87 m of na the ion exchange properties of eps were studied with a novel approach where eps were entangled with an inert binder pvdf hfp to form a membrane and characterized in an electrodialysis cell with a mixture of nacl and kcl salts the eps membrane was shown to act as a cation exchange membrane cem with a current efficiency of 80 meaning that eps do not behave as ideal cem surprisingly the membrane had selectivity for transport of k compared to na with a separation factor s k na of 1 3 these properties were compared to a layer prepared from a model compound of eps alginate and a commercial cem the alginate layer had a similar current efficiency 80 but even higher s k na of 1 9 while the commercial cem did not show selectivity towards k or na but exhibited the highest current efficiency of 92 the selectivity of eps and alginate towards k transport has interesting potential applications for ion separation from water streams and should be further investigated the anion repelling and cation binding properties of eps in hydrated and dehydrated granules were further confirmed with microscopy sem edx epifluorescence and ion chromatography icp oes ic techniques results of specific methanogenic activity sma tests conducted with 0 22 and 0 87 m na adapted granular sludges and with various monovalent salts suggested that ions which are preferentially transported by eps are also more toxic towards methanogenic cells graphical abstract image 1 keywords ion selectivity ion transport anaerobic

increase in size gagliano et al 2017 and can even be formed from dispersed biomass sudmalis et al 2018a at na concentrations as high as 0 87 m while maintaining high methanogenic activity for successful high rate anaerobic reactor operation this high methanogenic activity could in part be explained by production of osmolytes by the dominant methanogens allowing to balance the osmotic pressure between the microbial cells and the bulk liquid sudmalis et al 2018b the toxic effect of highly saline environments on anaerobic microbial consortia has mainly been attributed to cations

that produce reactive oxygen species and by interference with membrane transport processes harrison et al 2007 chen et al 2014 in anaerobic granular sludge microorganisms are entangled in a matrix of extracellular polymeric substances eps forming a dense spherical biofilm structure zhou et al 2006 seviour et al 2012 extracellular polymeric substances generally have a net negative charge liu and fang 2003 ajao et al 2018 which enables them to adsorb multivalent heavy metals toner et al 2005 comte et al 2006b comte et al 2008 d abzac et al 2013 li and yu 2014 dobrowolski et al 2017 sorption of monovalent cations by eps of pure cultures of marine bacteria has also been shown while the eps of halomonas sp were shown to poorly adsorb monovalent cations gutierrez et al 2012 the eps of pseudoalteromonas have a high affinity towards k sorption gutierrez et al 2008 due to ability of cation sorption eps can alleviate toxicity of low concentrations mg l range of metals towards microorganisms teitzel and parsek 2003 harrison et al 2007 flemming and wingender 2010 wang et al 2013 by binding and coordination reactions between the metals and the negatively charged functional groups of eps which prevents their diffusion into the deeper parts of the biofilm teitzel and parsek 2003 horn and morgenroth 2006 hu et al 2007 a recent microscopy study of our group has shown that mannose rich eps surrounding methanogenic cells in high salinity adapted granular sludge adsorb high concentrations of sodium gagliano et al 2018 these results suggest that even at high salinity eps may have a protective role against monovalent cations such as na by hindering their diffusion into microbial cells gagliano et al 2018 at high concentrations 0 2 m cl has been reported to cause toxicity to aerobic acidophilic microorganisms because the flux of cl into microbial cells alters the intracellular ph suzuki et al 1999 in general anions are typically reported to be less toxic for anaerobic microorganisms than cations however no attempts to explain this lower toxicity seem to have been reported in principle anions and cations both contribute to osmotic pressure in water smith et al 2016 and therefore microorganisms should have a strategy to cope with high concentrations of either of them theoretically the negative charge of eps should prevent or hinder the transport of anions to microbial cells thereby lowering their toxicity towards the microorganisms present in porous biofilm structures such as sludge granules however this ability of eps to partially repel anions has not been experimentally demonstrated thus far only few studies focused on the transport rather than sorption of monovalent ions e g k na cl in eps layers in one study siegrist and gujer 1985 experimentally determined the diffusion coefficients of br and na in a heterogeneous biofilm and found that these values were smaller compared to their diffusion coefficients in water additionally the diffusion coefficient of br in biofilm was slightly higher compared to na in another study horn and morgenroth 2006 studied the diffusion of nacl and nano3 in biofilms but the transport of individual ionic species could not be distinguished because conductivity rather than individual ion concentrations was measured in the current study the distribution of monovalent ions k na and cl was investigated in microbial granules adapted to 0 87 m and 0 22 m of na initial results indicated that cl is repelled from the granular sludge by eps surrounding the microorganisms to verify this the ion exchange nature of eps was investigated this was done with a novel approach where eps extracted from anaerobic granular sludge were used to fabricate eps layers eps membranes and these were tested in an electrodialysis cell for transport of k na and cl finally to study if the ions with the highest transport rate would also more negatively affect methanogenic activity the effect of different concentrations of na and k towards specific methanogenic activity sma of 0 87 m and 0 22 m na adapted granular sludge was determined 2 materials and methods 2 1 source of anaerobic granular sludge anaerobic granular sludge was obtained from laboratory scale upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactors the reactors were operated at na concentrations of 0 22 r5 and 0 87 r20 m as described in sudmalis et al 2018a 2 2 ion distribution and concentration within salt adapted granular sludge 2 2 1 scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy sem edx samples of granules for sem edx analysis were prepared with a modified procedure described in ismail et al 2010 the modifications included dehydration with graded series 10 30 50 70 and two times 100 of ethanol instead of acetone and sputter coating with tungsten instead of platinum tungsten was chosen for sputter coating due to its lower grain size compared to platinum and therefore possibility for imaging at higher magnifications bell et al 1987 echlin 2009 the granules were imaged at an acceleration voltage of 10 kv and a beam current of 0 4 na at room temperature in a field emission scanning electron microscope magellan 400 fei company oregon usa equipped with energy dispersive x ray detector the images were processed using aztec software oxford instruments 2 2 2 ion concentration in hydrated granular sludge approximately 20 g of sludge samples for determination of ion concentrations in hydrated granular sludge were taken directly from r5 and r20 through a sampling port located 7 5 cm from the bottom of the reactor columns with a total column height of 65 cm for ionic composition measurements of hydrated granular sludge the sludge was first separated from the liquid phase by centrifugation at 10000 xg and 4 c for 15 min further the sludge samples were carefully homogenised with a spatula and two samples approximately 0 5 g each of homogenised solids were taken for microwave digestion ethos 1 advanced microwave digestion labstation milestone s r l italy with 10 ml of 65 hno3 for analysis emsure iso digested samples were brought up to 50 ml with mili q water and further diluted for analysis as a blank for ionic composition of solids mili q was treated in the same way as the samples the supernatant after centrifugation was filtered through 0 2 μm cellulose acetate membrane filter vwr syringe filters and diluted with mili q for further analysis the filtered supernatant from this point forward will be referred to as the bulk liquid throughout the manuscript measurements of bulk liquid were made in one replicate to confirm the expected bulk liquid concentrations of ions differences between measurements and expected values were below 2 in all cases additionally to elucidate the cation exchange properties of eps in sludge granules the distribution of cl na and k in granules of r20 upon granular sludge exposure to equimolar k 0 87 m concentration was investigated to do this 1 g of r20 granular sludge was immersed in 1l of a modified nahco3 and nacl replaced with khco3 and kcl respectively nutrient medium of r20 sudmalis et al 2018a for 24 h before analysis of ionic composition with sample preparation as described above a period of 24 h for ion exchange was chosen to ensure that an equilibrium between the sludge granules and the modified nutrient medium is reached as a control r20 granular sludge was also exposed to its original medium containing 0 87 m of na sudmalis et al 2018a analysis of na and k was carried out by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy icp oes varian australia as described in gagliano et al 2018 chloride content was measured on dionex ics 2100 ion chromatography system breda the netherlands equipped with a dionex ionpac as19 column 4 250 mm and data were processed with chromeleon 6 80 sr13 software the results are presented on weight bases mmolion gmedium and mmolion gwet sludge to prevent introduction of errors due to differences in the density of the medium and the granular sludge 2 3 ion exchange properties of eps 2 3 1 extraction and purification of eps extracellular polymeric substances eps were extracted from granular sludge adapted to 0 87 m of na r20 by using an alkaline extraction method as reported by felz et al 2016 in short 3 g of granular sludge wet weight were put into a 0 5 w v na2co3 solution heated to 80 c and stirred at 400 rpm for 35 min after extraction the cell debris and insoluble fraction of the extract were separated by centrifugation at 4000 xg and 4 c for 20 min finally the eps solution was dialysed snakeskin 3 5k mwco against milli q for 24 h to obtain purified eps in a dry state the eps solution was further lyophilised at 84 c and 0 001 mbar 2 3 2 fabrication of alginate gel layers alg membranes extracellular polymeric substances are a mixture of proteins polysaccharides nucleic acids amyloids lipids and glycoproteins with proteins and polysaccharides often being the main constituents of eps seviour et al 2019 amongst all of these constituents alginate and alginate alike molecules anionic polysaccharides are frequently reported to be found in pure cultures of microbial cells as well as in microbial aggregates körstgens et al 2001 lin et al 2009 2010 flemming and wingender 2010 therefore alginate layers were prepared as a control for comparison of their ion exchange properties with layers prepared by using the eps extracted from granular sludge the alginate gel layers alg membranes were casted with an external gelation method adapted from li et al 2015 in following steps i dissolving the polymer in 10 ml milli q ii degassing the solution for 24 h at 4 c iii casting the solution on a petri dish id 5 7 cm and drying at 40 c in a levelled oven iv crosslinking the casted layers in a 2 w v calcium chloride solution with 30 v v of ethanol for casting a mixture of 0 4 g of sodium alginate sa and 0 004 g of guar gum gg as a plasticiser were used resulting in 0 016 g sa cm2 the resulting membrane was washed with demi water and equilibrated in a solution with 10 mm nacl and 10 mm kcl for 8 h before ion selectivity tests 2 3 3 fabrication of layers with eps eps membranes first a polymeric solution was prepared by dissolving poly vinylidene fluoride co hexafluoropropene pvdf hfp in dimethyl acetamide dmac in a ratio 1 9 5 w v for 3 h at 80 c then a weighed amount of eps was dispersed in the polymeric solution and the materials were blended in a ball mill for 4 h the resulting mixture contained 70 30 wt ratio of pvdf hfp to eps the mixture was cast onto a glass plate at 50 c until complete evaporation of the solvent the resulting layer eps membrane was washed with demi water and equilibrated in a solution with 10 mm nacl and 10 mm kcl for 8 h before ion selectivity tests the content of eps in the eps membrane was approximately 0 0027 g eps cm2 of dry membrane this was calculated from the total area of the membrane by assuming a uniform eps distribution 2 3 4 confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm for visualisation of eps distribution in the polymeric binder pvdf hfp to visualize the eps distribution in the eps membranes the membranes were first equilibrated in a buffer solution 10 mm kcl and 10 mm nacl overnight for the staining of the protein fraction of eps the eps membranes were placed in pbs 1x and sypro ruby invitrogen molecular probes usa for 1 h in the dark finally the membranes were washed with the buffer solution and immediately observed under clsm to guarantee that sypro ruby does not stain pvdf hfp a pure pvdf hfp membrane was processed in the same way as eps membranes before the clsm analysis autofluorescence of pvdf hfp was tested as described in appendix 1 microscopy analysis was performed with an inverted axioobserver zeiss lsm 880 clsm carl zeiss germany with a 40 1 3 oil dic m27 plan apochromat objective lens autofluorescence of pvdf hfp in the membranes was visualised with 488 nm excitation wavelength at a maximum emission of 510 nm sypro ruby signal was visualised with 458 nm excitation wavelength at a maximum emission of 656 nm the argon laser was set to 1 power for both excitation wavelengths a series of z axis images 212 5 μm 212 5 μm x 70 μm were generated by optical sectioning with a slice thickness of 1 μm maximum projection intensity and orthogonal 3d reconstruction were generated with zen blue software zen imaging software zeiss germany the choice of emission wavelengths and the dye for eps protein staining is explained in detail in appendix 1 2 3 5 electrochemical characterization and ion selectivity performance of the layers as ion exchange membranes was evaluated in a six compartment electrodialysis cell as shown in fig 1 different membranes separated the compartments inside the cell i the membrane under investigation placed in between compartments a and b this membrane was either eps membrane alg membrane or a commercial membrane neosepta cmx astom corporation tokyo japan used as a comparison ii commercial ion exchange membranes i e neosepta amx and cmx which separated the other compartments characterization of the membranes was done with a solution containing a mixture of two different monovalent cations i e k and na as chloride salts allowing for direct comparison of monovalent ion transport through the membranes in multi ion solutions before each experiment all membranes were equilibrated in a mixed cation solution 10 mm nacl 10 mm kcl for 8 h which allows any weakly adsorbed ion to diffuse to the bulk solution and the exchange of some na for k compartments a b and c were filled with a solution containing 10 mm nacl and 10 mm kcl whereas compartments d were filled with 0 1 m na2so4 solution compartments a and b were filled with 130 ml solutions that were continuously stirred for compartments c and d 1l solutions were circulated at a flow rate of 170 ml min to keep the ion concentrations constant throughout the experiment a current density of 10 a m2 was applied to the cell for 1 h samples from compartments a and b were taken over time and ion concentration was measured by ion chromatography an increase in chloride concentration was calculated from compartment a whereas increases in sodium and potassium concentration were calculated from compartment b ion selectivity s in the membranes is based on the concentration changes between potassium and sodium and is given by eq 1 s k na δ c k δ c na and eq 2 δ c c t c initial where t c initial and c t are the sampling time the initial concentration and the concentration at time t measured in compartment b respectively the ability of the membrane to allow the transport of only one type of ion cations or anions the permselectivity was characterized as current efficiency η eq 3 η i i 2 c t i c initial i v cell f i t where subscript i refers to cation species in solution i e potassium and sodium v cell is the volume of liquid in compartment b l f is faraday s constant 96485 c mol i is the applied current a and t is time s the current efficiency gives an indication on how selectively ions are transported across the membrane sadrzadeh and mohammadi 2009 i e it indicates if the ionic current is mainly transported by potassium and sodium cation exchange membrane or the membranes also allow the transport of chloride 2 4 effect of anions and cations on specific methanogenic activity to study the effect of monovalent anions and cations on specific methanogenic activity sma of salt adapted granular sludge batch experiments in 118 ml serum bottles at a working volume of 50 ml 120 rpm mixing speed and 35 c were performed the vss concentration was set to 1 g l and the cod vss ratio was 4 1 w w sodium acetate was used as the electron donor and carbon source the sma was calculated through measurements of pressure build up curves with a pressure meter equipped with an absolute pressure probe gmh3151 greisinger electronic germany the biogas composition at the end of experiments was measured as described in steinbusch et al 2008 unless stated otherwise the experiments were performed in triplicate all results were corrected for the atmospheric pressure and pressure build up in blank experiments without added acetate the first set of experiments was performed to study the sma of granular sludge adapted to 0 22 r5 and 0 87 r20 m of na when exposed to equimolar concentration of cations by addition of nabr kcl and kbr the second set of experiments was performed to study the sma of r5 granular sludge upon exposure to hyper salinity shocks i e an abrupt increase of salinity by spiking a nutrient medium with increased ion concentration of nacl nabr kcl and kbr the final cation concentration in these experiments was 0 43 m bromide salts were tested nabr and kbr to investigate if different anions at very high salinity would also have a substantial effect on sma as is frequently reported for cations kugelman and mccarty 1965 lefebvre et al 2007 fang et al 2011 all experiments contained 0 08 m of na originating from inocula and sodium acetate as a carbon source this was taken into account when calculating the desired concentration of cations in the experiments the nutrient medium was the same as reported earlier sudmalis et al 2018b nacl nabr kcl and kbr salt amounts were calculated to reach the desired cation concentration for each experiment 3 results 3 1 equilibrium of sodium chloride and potassium in granules at different salinities the measured ion concentrations fig 2 and distributions fig 4 in the anaerobic salt adapted granular sludges show high affinity of eps towards cations compared to anions fig 2 a b show the na and cl concentrations in the bulk liquid and in granular sludges of r5 and r20 respectively sodium concentration in the granular sludge was 0 24 0 004 0 24 m and 0 71 0 01 0 71 m mmol gwet sludge in r5 and r20 respectively the na concentration in r5 granular sludge was 9 higher compared to the bulk liquid whereas in r20 it was 17 lower compared to the bulk liquid the cl concentration was 0 11 0 002 0 11 m and 0 52 0 001 0 52 m mmol gwet sludge in r5 and r20 respectively fig 2 a b these concentrations correspond to a 31 2 and 35 8 lower cl concentration compared to the bulk liquid in r5 and r20 respectively thus apparently eps of granular sludge acclimated to 0 22 and 0 87 m of na preferentially repel anions such as cl probably due to anionic nature of eps as will be discussed in more detail in section 4 1 potassium concentration in the r20 granular sludge before changing the medium was 0 05 mmol gwet sludge 0 02 g gsludge vs fig 3 this corresponds to a 28 fold increase compared to the growth medium such a high concentration of k can be found within methanogenic cells upon exposure to high osmotic stress even after accumulation of osmolytes within the microbial cells sowers and gunsalus 1995 when placing the r20 granules previously exposed to 0 87 m na in a nutrient medium with k 0 87 m the cl concentration in the granular sludge did not change fig 3 however na had almost completely been displaced with k within 24 h fig 3 this indicates a cation exchange nature of eps in the anaerobic granular sludge after the medium change the k concentration within the granular sludge reached a concentration of 0 81 0 04 mmol gwet sludge 0 32 g gsludge vs which is higher compared to the na concentration of 0 73 0 002 mmol gwet sludge in the control sample this shows a higher eps sorption capacity of k in granular sludge compared to na at a given molarity scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy sem edx of sliced microbial granules adapted to 0 87 m of na showed a uniform distribution of na ions throughout the granules fig 4 a confirming the ionic composition results in fig 2 in contrast to the ion chromatography results fig 2 cl could not be detected in the granules with sem edx imaging fig 4 b this could be a result of cl ions removal together with water from the pores of the granular sludge during the dehydration steps of the sem samples preparation see materials and methods this removal of cl coupled with na retention in the granules suggests that na was bound to the eps whereas chloride was mainly present in the water phase of the granule pores as will be further discussed in section 4 2 the binding of na to eps was further verified via fluorescent corona red na staining on r5 and r20 hydrated granules appendix 4 microscopy analysis confirmed the presence of na in the eps matrix surrounding granules fig s4 while the quantification of the corona red signal emission of r5 and r20 granules cells appendix 4 showed that the average intracellular na concentration was in the range 55 66 mm in both granules these results confirmed the binding properties of such eps towards na 3 2 the ion exchange properties of eps membrane and alg membrane the clsm analysis showed that binding of eps with pvdf hfp was successful fig 5 a c with a uniform distribution of eps in red stained with sypro ruby as a thin layer on the surface of the pvdf hfp in green such a distribution is likely due to the hydrophobic nature of pvdf hfp which could only interact with the hydrophobic moieties of otherwise largely hydrophilic eps and did not allow for penetration of eps in the depth of the membrane the negative control staining fig 5 b d confirmed that sypro ruby does not bind to pvdf hfp membranes and that the signal in fig 5 a c indeed originated from sypro ruby bound to proteinaceous fraction of eps after successful preparation of the membranes as shown in fig 5 a c their selectivity towards transport of k na and cl was tested in an electrodialysis cell fig 6 i ii and iii show changes in k and na concentration in compartment b and of cl concentration in compartment a for the alg membrane eps membrane and the commercial membrane respectively cations were preferentially transported across the membranes whereas cl ions were partially repelled in addition a preferential transport of k over na across the alg and eps membrane was measured fig 6 i ii the rate of change in ion concentration determined by the slopes of the curves m value shows that in the alg membrane the k transport was 11 higher and na transport was 23 lower than in the eps membrane the resulting potassium selectivity s k na 1 is depicted in fig 6 iv and was higher for the alg membrane compared to eps membrane with the commercial ion exchange membrane there was no markedly difference in the transport between k and na fig 6 iii iv in fig 6 iv the current efficiency shows how much of the current was transported by cations despite the non ideal cation selectivity of the bio membranes the current efficiency was relatively high 79 for the alg membrane and 83 for the eps membrane the commercial membrane gave the highest current efficiency of 92 3 3 effect of anions and cations on specific methanogenic activity fig 7 a shows that exposure of 0 22 m na adapted granular sludge to equimolar concentration of kcl and kbr salts resulted in a decrease of methanogenic activity by 25 3 and 11 7 respectively when compared to the reference at 0 22 m of na doubling the ion concentration to 0 43 m of kcl and kbr resulted in sma decrease by 49 2 and 44 1 respectively the negative effect of na salts on the sma of granular sludge at increased molarity of 0 43 m was considerably less pronounced compared to k salts fig 7 a the sma decreased by 19 9 and 11 1 with nacl and nabr salts respectively it seems that in general br salts had a slightly smaller negative effect on sma compared to cl salts fig 7 a however the results obtained with nabr at 0 22 m fig 7 a did not follow the overall trend therefore additional experiments are needed in the future to confirm this finally the 0 87 m na adapted granular sludge could retain its methanogenic activity when exposed to equimolar concentration of nabr fig 7 b nabr had no clear negative effect on the sma whereas 0 87 m of k salts resulted in complete loss of methanogenic activity overall the results of the sma tests clearly show that at equimolar concentrations of monovalent salts the methanogenic activity of salt nacl adapted granular sludge was more influenced by changing the cations na to k than by changing the anions cl to br 4 discussion 4 1 cation exchange membrane properties of eps and potassium selectivity in one of our previous studies mannose rich eps of anaerobic granular sludge adapted to high salinity was shown to bind na gagliano et al 2018 the current results further demonstrate that the eps matrix of granules grown at 0 22 r5 and 0 87 m of na r20 is indeed able to retain high na concentrations figs 2 and 4 and fig s4 even though the sodium concentration in granules of r20 was lower compared to the bulk liquid fig 2 it is worth noticing that the granules in r5 contained considerably less na approx 3 times compared to r20 granules sorption behaviour of eps can be characterized by freundlich and or langmuir sorption isotherms as reported by dobrowolski et al 2017 thus such differences can be explained by the fact that in r20 potentially the maximum eps na sorption capacity was reached while it was not the case in r5 granules it is also not excluded that these maximum sorption capacities differ in r5 and r20 because it is known that as a response to a high salinity the chemical composition of eps in anaerobic sludges changes in time vyrides and stuckey 2009 in fact we have recently shown that the eps glycoconjugate composition of granules grown under the same conditions as r5 is different compared to those grown under conditions as in r20 gagliano et al 2018 it is not clear whether the na sorption capacity of r5 and r20 granules was similar from the start however experiments in continuously operated uasb reactors where the influent of r5 was exchanged with r20 for a period of two weeks showed that the new ion equilibria became very similar i e na and cl concentration in r5 granules became very comparable to r20 granules and vice versa appendix 5 this is an interesting result because it shows that anaerobic granules grown under very different salt conditions reach very similar cation and anion equilibria upon exposure to new environmental conditions when these eps were extracted from r20 granules and entangled in a layer with an inert binder pvdf hfp these layers behaved as cation exchange membranes cem i e partially repelled anions such as cl and selectively transported cations such as k and na fig 6 i ii this is probably the result of the abundant presence of different negatively charged functional groups such as carboxylic phenolic and phosphoric groups in eps d abzac et al 2013 the same cem ability was shown also for the alg membranes most likely because of abundance of negatively charged carbonyl groups at neutral ph in alginate nestle and kimmich 1996 lee and mooney 2012 the eps and alg membranes were not fully cation selective fig 6 since the transport of cations na and k represented 80 of the total ionic current fig 6 iv thus 20 of the ionic current can be attributed to transport of cl such non ideal cation exchange nature of eps would be desirable from a microbial perspective because ideal behaviour would prevent diffusion of important substrates such as phosphate or acetate to the microbial cells from a physical chemical perspective some transport of anions such as cl through eps membranes and alginate membranes is expected due to their hydrogel nature hydrogels are known for their hydrophilic structure and hence high sensitivity to water high water uptake leading to swelling or even dissolution lee and mooney 2012 ahmed 2015 the swelling in the membranes can create non selective paths channels for ion k na and cl passage this is due to decrease of charge density caused by swelling in a membrane with a fixed amount of charges such decreased charge density may lead to decreased ion functional group interactions optical coherence tomography oct analysis appendix 2 showed that a hydrated pvdf hfp membrane was 50 μm thick while addition of 10 w w eps increased the membrane thickness by 89 μm clearly showing that swelling of eps indeed took place surprisingly the eps and particularly the alg membrane were more selective to k than to na fig 6 iv such selectivity was not measured in the commercial membrane fig 6 iv and is known to be difficult to achieve with commercial membranes in general luo et al 2018 it is not clear which eps and alginate properties resulted in such a selectivity the low transport of na compared to k across the membranes may be related to several factors such as i steric effects due to the higher hydrated size of na 3 58 å than k 3 31 å nightingale 1959 ii strong interactions e g adsorption between na and the functional groups in the membranes mubita et al 2020 and iii the initial na k ratio in the membranes these factors certainly should be further looked into it should also be noted that while the overall cation exchange properties of eps repulsion of anions and transport of cations were unlikely to be significantly altered due to the harsh alkaline extraction method used in this study comparison of e g figs 2 and 6 it is known that different extraction methods can result in e g different metal binding ability capacity of heavy metals comte et al 2006a d abzac et al 2010 thus in future studies the eps membranes should be prepared with eps extracted with various extraction methods because transport properties of individual cations may also be potentially affected depending on the extraction procedure used the current efficiency of alg membrane was very similar to that of the eps membrane fig 6 iv measurements of charge density show a markedly difference between alginate and eps appendix 3 in principle membranes with high charge density favour the conductivity of counter ions geise et al 2013 alginate had a charge density of 7 0 meq g and eps a charge density of 2 5 meq g as measured for free dissolved polymers in solution these values may be significantly different in the membranes themselves due to charge shielding in alg membranes the crosslinking with calcium ions may have led to a reduction of charged functional groups available for ion exchange in the eps membranes some functional groups may have been completely embedded in the matrix of the supporting polymers pdvf hfp therefore in future studies the real charge densities in the membranes themselves should be assessed for example by acid base titration hosseini et al 2012 4 2 methanogenic activity inhibition by various ions the methanogenic activity of 0 87 m na adapted granular sludge was completely inhibited when this sludge was exposed to equimolar concentrations of k fig 7 b also exposure of 0 22 m na adapted granular sludge to 0 22 m of k led to a 25 decrease in methanogenic activity the decrease of sma was smaller 19 9 when exposing the same granular sludge to 0 43 m na fig 7 a kugelman and mccarty 1965 showed that k had a stronger negative effect on methanogenic activity than na using low salinity adapted sludge and equimolar concentrations of sodium and potassium bicarbonate our results extend this finding with cl salts and high salinity adapted sludge and demonstrate that anions at equimolar concentrations have little influence on the sma fig 7 the mechanism of a potential br or cl toxicity on methanogens is not known possibly anion toxicity is masked by the ability of eps to repel these anions as was shown in this study figs 2 figure 3 fig 6 this masking would occur if granular structure could be viewed upon as a cation exchange membrane fig 8 appendix 3 the concentration of ions in membranes is determined by the concentration of fixed charged functional groups in it and meets the requirement of electroneutrality according to the following equation galama et al 2013 eq 4 c c o u n t e r i o n c c o i o n x 0 where c counter ion is the concentration of the ion with the charge opposite to the functional groups of the membrane cations in the case of eps c co ion is the concentration of ions with the same charge as the functional groups of a membrane anions in the case of eps and x is the concentration of charged functional groups negative for eps due to the fixed negative charges of eps with a concentration x the concentration of negatively charged co ions in the porous granular structure can potentially be reduced while positively charged counterions are allowed to accumulate fig 8 the extent to which the amount of co ions is reduced in the granular structure compared to the bulk liquid depends on x due to the fixation of the charged functional groups in eps and their interaction with cations the osmotic pressure experienced by the microbial cells can be reduced this was partially proven in this study by evaluating the na content of methanogenic cells after fluorescent staining appendix 4 which was much lower than the surrounding medium 66 mm intracellular versus 0 87 m extracellularly this hypothesis can potentially be further tested with eps deficient mutants of methanogens in toxicity experiments and by comparing their sensitivity to different anions with eps covered methanogens such an approach has been used by wang et al 2013 to study the role of eps in osmo protection upon exposure of klebsiella pneumoniae to 100 mm of cacl2 this showed that in eps deficient microbial cells the turgor pressure decreased upon exposure to salt whereas in cells covered with eps the turgor pressure remained unaffected this suggests that eps helps to counteract the osmotic pressure experienced by microbial cells in high salinity environments the mechanism by which high k concentrations inhibit methanogenic activity is not exactly known toxicity studies with high concentrations of metallic cations and other types of microorganisms demonstrated interference with membrane transport processes either by competitively inhibiting membrane transporter proteins or by affecting the membrane potential harrison et al 2007 acetoclastic methanogens couple na transport across the cytoplasmic membrane with the transfer of the methyl group from tetrahydrosarcinapterin h4spt to coenzyme m hs com this precedes the final reduction step for methane production from acetate welte and deppenmeier 2014 also acetoclastic methanogens make use of both proton and na gradients across the cell membrane for atp synthesis welte and deppenmeier 2014 abrupt exposure of the microorganisms to high concentrations of k could potentially interfere with these processes prolonged periods more than a month of exposure can result in adaptation of methanogens to k concentrations of up to 0 19 m chen and cheng 2007 however further increases of k concentration in completely stirred continuously operated tank reactor resulted in decreasing methanogenic activity similar to results of batch experiments in this study chen and cheng 2007 this suggests that adaptation of methanogens to high k concentration is more difficult than adaptation to na albeit the lower na toxicity compared to k may be related to decreased ability of eps to bind k as shown in this study such direct interpretation should still be performed with care firstly as discussed in section 4 1 the eps properties to transport or bind cations may change as a result of the extraction method applied secondly the ion selectivity can be different for sorption compared to transport epsztein et al 2019 in principle this means that the higher k over na sorption capacity of granules shown in fig 3 should not be directly translated to ion transport properties of unextracted eps thirdly microbial cell membranes contain a high ubiquity of ion transporters martin et al 1999 and these are expected to also play an important role in regulating the ion exchange between the surrounding environment and the cytoplasm of microbial cells finally microbial cells can accumulate compatible solutes to balance osmotic pressure between the cells and the surrounding environment martin et al 2000 roberts 2005 sudmalis et al 2018b thus the eps as shown in fig 8 can only be viewed as one out of several protective mechanisms 4 3 can the eps membranes be applied for separation of sodium and potassium in practice separation of two monovalent cations is a serious challenge even for the most advanced electro membrane processes such as electrodialysis this is because these ions possess similar physicochemical properties e g hydrated size most state of the art ion exchange membranes lack selectivity for one specific ion luo et al 2018 with the mimicked bio membranes alg and eps membranes as prepared in this study a relatively high selectivity towards potassium over sodium s k na 1 was observed particularly for the alg membrane such selectivity was absent in a commercial cation exchange membrane fig 6 iv however the membranes prepared in this study cannot be considered for commercial application at this stage due to their limited stability approximately 48 h exposure of membranes to water leads to visible eps detachment from the pvdf eps membrane and to water leakage in the alg membrane data not shown in the eps membrane this is likely due to weak adhesion between eps hydrophilic with hydrophobic moieties and pvdf hydrophobic whereas in the alg membrane this is likely due to ca2 exchange with na leading to disintegration of 3d structure of the gel lee and mooney 2012 future studies need to focus on the eps and sodium alginate properties that dictate the selective transport of k over na which may help to develop analogous synthetic membranes such investigations should include fractionation of eps extracts in their constituents and also preparation of membranes with eps model constituents other than alginate e g proteins and glycoproteins to elucidate how these affect the membrane transport properties 5 concluding remarks and outlook to date only few studies have focused on transport of cations and anions through eps layers of microbial biofilms probably due to a lack of relatively simple methods in this study an electrochemical method with use of eps based membranes was shown to be effective in characterizing selectivity of eps towards transport of monovalent ions an unexpected result of this study was the selective transport of k over na through eps layers in an electrochemical cell despite the fact that the membranes as prepared in this study are of insufficient stability for commercial applications the underlying mechanism for such selectivity should still be further investigated a mechanistic understanding of k selectivity in eps layers could potentially lead to development of commercial membranes to treat e g green house water finally while in literature eps are sometimes mentioned as a potential protective barrier for microorganisms against high salinity mechanistic explanations on how exactly eps would be protective are scarcely reported the cation exchange nature of eps together with the ionic composition measurements of granular sludge in which considerably smaller amounts of cl were measured compared to the bulk liquid suggest that eps of the granules function as a protective barrier against anions in addition the cation interaction with the negatively charged functional groups of eps could further alleviate salt toxicity by lowering the osmotic pressure sensed by the microorganisms the suggested mechanism should be further explored declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

17932,although submarine groundwater discharge sgd comprises an insignificant proportion of the global hydrologic cycle it contributes significantly to chemical fluxes into the coastal waters due to concentrated constituents in coastal groundwater large nutrient loadings derived from sgd can lead to a series of environmental and ecological problems such as algal blooms resulting in water discoloration severe dissolved oxygen depletion and eventually beach closures and massive fish kills previous studies have demonstrated the relationship between algal blooms and sgd obtained from direct measurement with seepage meters or from geo tracer i e radon and radium based models these traditional methods are time consuming laborious and point monitoring and can hardly achieve a high spatiotemporal resolution sgd estimation which is vital in revealing the effects of sgd to algal blooms over a long period alternatively remote sensing methods for high spatiotemporal resolution sgd localization and quantification are applicable and effective the temperature difference or anomaly between groundwater and coastal water extracted from satellite thermal images can be used as the indicator to localize and detect sgd especially its fresh component or fresh sgd in this study multi year 2005 2011 and 2018 radon samples in tolo harbour were used to train regression models between in situ radon rn activity and the temperature anomaly by landsat satellite thermal images the models were used to estimate two decade variations of fresh sgd in tolo harbour the synergistic analysis between the time series of fresh sgd derived from regression models and high spatiotemporal resolution ecological metrics chlorophyll a algal cell counts and e coli leads to the findings that the increase of the fresh sgd associated with high nutrient concentrations is witnessed 10 20 days before the observations of algal bloom events this study makes the first attempt to demonstrate the strong relation between the sgd and algal blooms over a vicennial span and also provides a cost effective and robust technique to estimate sgd on a bay scale graphical abstract image 1 keywords submarine groundwater discharge radon remote sensing algal blooms e coli 1 introduction 1 1 overview submarine groundwater discharge sgd is defined as the seaward flow of water across the sea and land interface it includes the fresh sgd fsgd originated from terrestrial recharge and a recirculated component originated from the sea taniguchi 2002 burnett et al 2003 jiao and post 2019 the massive nutrient loadings associated with sgd are a major source in the ocean hwang et al 2005a lee et al 2012 luo and jiao 2016 in addition to the riverine loadings benthic diffusions and atmospheric dry wet depositions wai et al 2010 kim and kim 2011 rodellas et al 2015 trezzi et al 2016 previous studies have revealed that groundwater borne nutrients are of significance for coastal ecological systems johannes 1980 lapointe 1997 paytan et al 2006 swarzenski et al 2007 lee et al 2009 smith and swarzenski 2012 liu et al 2018 on the one hand the groundwater borne nutrients are essential chemicals that support the primary production and growth of coral reefs in oceans on the other hand excessive nutrient loading potentially leads to some ecological and environmental problems such as eutrophication algal blooms and degradation of coral reefs laroche et al 1997 lee and arega 1999 hwang et al 2005a 2005b lee and kim 2007 lee et al 2010 algal blooms or red tides as a global ecological concern can cause water discoloration and severe dissolved oxygen depletion a large proportion of red tides induced by k brevis kill fish by excreting neurotoxins algal blooms or red tides occur frequently in hong kong and present formidable challenges to coastal safety a total of 944 algal blooms have been reported from 1975 to 2018 in hong kong by agriculture fisheries and conservation department afcd phytoplankton or algae plays a vital role in the coastal ecosystems which are strongly affected by the freshwater inputs such as fsgd adolf et al 2019 some studies have identified the linkage between the groundwater borne nutrients and algal blooms hu et al 2006 lee et al 2010 lecher et al 2015 luo and jiao 2016 adolf et al 2019 the sgd estimates in these studies are within a short time span and these traditional methods based on the direct measurements by seepage meters or tracer techniques such as radon and radium are time consuming and laborious in addition to the aforementioned sgd effect on algal blooms coastal groundwater has been proven elsewhere to be the sources of fecal indicator bacteria fib which is the sum of total coliform tc fecal coliform fc and enterococcus ent fib is highly influential to the public health and fishery management boehm et al 2003 2004 2009 knee et al 2008 page et al 2012 yau et al 2014 some governments such as america and hong kong select the escherichia coli e coli one subgroup of fc as the bacteria indicator for public health of coastal water quality due to the significant correlation with swimming associated illness such as skin and gastrointestinal illnesses cheung et al 1990 and coastal fishery management markošová and jeẑek 1994 in hong kong e coli is monitored and detected monthly in stream beach and harbour waters by environment protection department epd since 1986 1 2 remote sensing for sgd estimation different from traditional methods remote sensing approach for sgd detection and quantification are more applicable and effective in long term monitoring the temperature differences between the discharged terrestrial groundwater and coastal seawater can indicate the sgd rates dale and miller 2007 the fresh groundwater is less dense than seawater so sgd especially for fsgd will be buoyant on the surface layer of seawater in general thermal remote sensing of sea surface temperature sst only reveals and delineates the temperatures at skin level water column 0 1 mm below the water surface handcock et al 2006 the sgd estimation from temperature differences hence represents mainly fsgd although some previous studies directly linked the temperature gradients to total sgd rates remote sensing methods have been successfully applied to delineate the interactions between the groundwater discharge and surface waters in different aquatic systems i e lakes and coastal waters shaban et al 2005 tcherepanov et al 2005 wilson and rocha 2012 2016 mallast et al 2013 2014 to date the remote sensing platforms mainly include satellites and airborne platforms the airborne platforms can easily mount the high spatial resolution thermal sensors with a frequent temporal deployment therefore most previous studies predominantly acquire and analyze the thermal infrared tir images collected from aerial surveys however airborne platforms are difficult to take tir images with a large spatial coverage such as estuaries or coasts in contrast satellites can provide longer continuous services and observations for sufficiently large spatial coverage while the limitation is the spatial and temporal resolutions for most satellite sensors are coarse compared to the airborne ones there have been still some encouraging results from the usgs series of landsat satellites which provide thermal images with a 60 m spatial resolution that then can be rebuilt to 30 m resolution bobba et al 1992 firstly used landsat 1 thermal images from march to july in 1974 to investigate the seasonal variations of groundwater discharge in southern ontario canada tcherepanov et al 2005 combined landsat tm thermal images under different weather conditions from 1989 to 2002 with ground based observations on lake temperatures to identify lacustrine groundwater discharge their study assigned lake zones with consistently cold temperatures to be potential groundwater zones shaban et al 2005 adopted both landsat and aerial images to localize sgd sites and submarine springs in north lebanon wang et al 2008 localized the groundwater discharge points in the delaware s inland bays using two landsat 7 emt tir images january 2000 and february 2002 and then investigated the ecological effects related to the groundwater discharge mallast et al 2013 also employed landsat 7 emt tir images within 2000 2011 to visualize the sgd sites and study the temporal variations of sgd along the entire dead sea coasts further attempts have been made by researchers to quantitatively plumb the groundwater discharge using coupled remote sensing and geotracer models radon rn is an ideal tracer to evaluate surface water and groundwater interactions burnett and dulaiova 2003 the rn activity in groundwater is generally several orders of magnitude higher than rn in surface waters exhibiting a sharp activity gradient at the surface groundwater interface schmidt et al 2009 therefore some recent studies started to associate the temperature anomaly ta derived from landsat images to rn wilson and rocha 2012 carried out a regional scale assessment of sgd locations in ireland using a total of 6 landsat 7 emt tir images collected in summer seasons may to august from 1999 to 2010 in their study 35 potential sgd sites were detected through tir images and verified with rn wilson and rocha 2016 further quantitatively studied the relationship between ta caused by groundwater discharge and rn activity in lough mask lake using 4 landsat 7 emt tir images in summer seasons may to july from 1999 to 2010 they found an anti correlation between the ta and rn activities with a correlation coefficient r2 ranging from 0 34 to 0 56 however there have been still limited studies to investigate the inter annual variability of groundwater discharge with high spatiotemporal landsat images and trained with sufficient rn samples over different years this paper presents a coupled remote sensing 222rn tracer model to estimate the variations of fsgd from 1998 to 2017 in tolo harbour and to explore the relationships between fsgd and some ecological metrics such as the algal blooms and fib based on a two decade dataset it is believed that the cost effective and robust remote sensing technique complements traditional methods to estimate sgd and investigate further its ecological significance of sgd 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area tolo harbour a land locked tidal estuary in the northeastern part of hong kong is extended around 20 km from southwest to northeast and it connects to mirs bay with a narrow tolo channel with a width less than 1 5 km choi and lee 2004 tolo harbour has a surface area of 50 km2 with a total catchment area of 160 km2 and a shoreline of 82 km lee et al 2012 luo et al 2014 based on different water flushing times tolo harbour can be divided into 7 segments fig 1 jirka and lee 1994 the mean sea level is 1 45 m above principal datum mpd and the average tidal range is 1 06 m data from hong kong observatory hko the water depths of tolo harbour range from 2 m to 8 m dong 2010 six main rivers and streams namely lam tsuen lt river shan liu sl stream shing mum sm river tai po tp river tai po kau tpk stream and tung tze tt stream empty into the inner harbour fig 1 the rocks around the harbor are comprised of middle jurassic lower cretaceous volcanic rocks devonian sedimentary rocks middle jurassic lower cretaceous plutonic rocks small scale quaternary deposits and reclaimed lands a series of faults trending northeast and northwest were generated the largest fault is the lai chi kok tolo channel fault which belongs to a fault zone extending across sha tin valley to tolo channel tse and jiao 2008 2 2 satellite thermal image acquisition a total of 159 landsat thermal images landsat 5tm landsat 7 etm and landsat 8 oli which are largely clouds free over 3rd 4th and 5th segments in tolo harbour were obtained from the usgs earth explorer website http earthexplorer usgs gov from 1998 to 2017 the spatial resolution of landsat thermal images was all rebuilt to 30 m the imagery was acquired at the local time 10 30 h these thermal images were used to retrieve the sst and ta maps to localize and assess the fsgd to the harbour three landsat clear sky images captured closest to three field trip dates respectively on 5 march 2005 3 july 2011 and 7 august 2018 were used for the generation of regression models with ground truthing rn samples hence the time windows between the imaged time and in situ field data time for each sampling event were 0 8 and 17 days respectively much longer time window in 2018 was ascribed to extensive cloud cover induced by the typhoon mangkhut around the field trip period 2 3 sst mapping all landsat thermal images were processed to generate sst map using the environment for visualizing images envi the methodology for retrieval of surface temperature from landsat 5 tm band 6 data landsat 7 etm band 6 data and landsat 8 oli band 10 11 data is presented in details in previous studies and official released handbooks by nasa thomas et al 2002 barsi et al 2003 wilson and rocha 2012 2016 landsat project science office 2003 2019 briefly first the raw thermal data dn is converted to top of atmosphere toa radiance value which is a mixed radiance of three different types of energy emitted radiance from the earth surface upwelling radiance from the atmosphere and downwelling radiance from the air then the atmospheric correction is undertaken for the toa radiance to determine the surface water radiance l λt using equation 1 with the atmospheric correction parameters extracted from an online website tool by nasa 1 l λ t l λ t o a l λ u p τ ε 1 ε 1 l λ d o w n where l λt represents the surface radiance of a blackbody target of kinetic temperature t w μm sr m2 l λtoa is toa recorded by the sensor w μm sr m2 l λup and l λdown are the upwelling and downwelling radiance w μm sr m2 respectively ε is the atmospheric transmission τ is the water emissivity constant of 0 989 snyder et al 1998 srivastava et al 2009 wilson and rocha 2012 wilson and rocha 2016 finally the surface temperature t ss can be converted from the atmospherically corrected surface water radiance with equation 2 2 t s s k 2 ln k 1 l λ t 1 where t ss is the surface sea temperature k k 1 w μm sr m2 and k 2 k are thermal conversion constants as listed in the process manual released by landsat project science office after the sst retrieval of all satellite thermal images a validation was carried out between the retrieved temperatures with the surface coastal temperature data collected from hko 2 4 ta mapping the temperature difference between surface seawater and groundwater can be regarded as one of the indicators to localize the sgd especially for its fresh component for hong kong coastal waters the temperature of groundwater is normally higher than the surface coastal waters in winter while lower in summer for a better discussion the ta calculation is adapted from wilson and rocha 2012 wilson and rocha 2016 to avoid the negative ta over different seasons 3 t a t i p t where ta represents temperature anomaly c which is the absolute value of the temperature difference between the sst of each pixel t ip extracted from the processed satellite images and the concurrent average sst t recorded by hko 2 5 rn measurement and analysis three field trips were respectively carried out on 5 march 2005 11 july 2011 and 24 august 2018 rn samples were taken from seawater river and stream water and groundwater rn samples of seawater and river water were measured by rad7 big bottle system and rn samples in groundwater were measured by rad h2o lee and kim 2007 all rn samples were analyzed within 3 days after the sampling to avoid significant decay loss finally a total of 35 rn samples were obtained from surface seawater in the three study areas of the 3rd 4th and 5th segments fig 1 2 6 time series data ten parameters of water quality hydrometeorology and red tide metrics from 1998 to 2017 were retrieved from several hong kong government departments the coastal nutrient data were compiled from records of epd marine stations tm3 tm5 and tm7 fig 1 and records from three fish culture zones fcz by afcd the algal cell counts chlorophyll a concentrations and red tide records were also collected from afcd coastal and riverine e coli concentrations and runoff data were extracted from epd groundwater e coli concentrations were extracted from civil engineering and development department cedd the water quality parameters were measured based on international standard methods epd 2019 hydrometeorological data including daily seawater temperature rainfall evapotranspiration and precipitation were retrieved from hong kong observatory hko specifically daily rainfall data were obtained from 6 auto recorded weather stations installed within the tolo harbour water control zones daily evapotranspiration and seawater temperature data were collected from the station installed at king s park which is about 10 km from tolo harbour 3 results 3 1 sst and ta mapping table 1 shows the satellite derived information of three landsat thermal images respectively captured on 5 march 2005 3 july 2011 and 7 august 2018 as this study involved different seasons the satellite derived averaged sst minimum values ranged from 12 3 c to 24 3 c sst maximum values were between 15 6 c and 30 6 c fig s1 shows relationship between sst retrieved from satellite images and hko data 1 m below water surface for three segments the sst results were further validated by quantitative correlation analysis as shown in fig 2 the cold water plumes presented adjacent to the shorelines in summer i e july and august and warm water plumes shown in march with cold weather ta ranged from 0 04 c march to 4 2 c august as a reference the average groundwater temperatures near tolo harbour fig 1 were recorded by cedd during 1993 and 1996 in the range of 13 8 c and 28 5 c 3 2 steady state rn mass balance model rn activities of the harbour water open seawater river and coastal groundwater in 2005 2011 can be found in luo and jiao 2016 and data for 2018 are shown in table s1 notably the activity of rn in harbour water is much lower than those from river and groundwater and the averaged radon activity in surface harbour water in 2005 25 8 6 5 dpm l 1 was higher than 2011 and 2018 19 7 4 7 dpm l 1 11 2 2 0 dpm l 1 respectively rn is mainly sourced from total sgd porewater diffusion and surface runoff and lost by radioactive decay tidal flushing and atmospheric evasion tse and jiao 2008 kim and kim 2011 the total sgd in 2005 and 2011 was 11 8 cm d in 2005 and 7 3 cm d in 2011 respectively based on the radon mass balance model of previous study in tolo harbour luo and jiao 2016 the total sgd in 2018 is quantified using equation 4 4 d r n d t a q s g d q r i v e r q s e d i λ r n q a t m i e x λ m i x 0 where a is the rn activity in the groundwater end member which is 233 9 10 1 dpm l 1 n 4 q river is riverine contribution to harbour water rn inventory and is calculated to be 178 5 9 6 dpm d 1 m 2 by multiplying the averaged rn activity in river water 132 4 7 1 dpm l 1 n 3 with the 10 year averaged runoff 67413 96 m3 d 1 q sed dpm d 1 m 2

q atm dpm d 1 m 2 is the rn atmospheric evasion loss i ex dpm m 2 is the rn inventory excess between open seawater and embayment water λ mix is the tidal mixing rate or the reciprocal of harbour water residence time 0 105 d 1 jirka and lee 1994 in the mass balance model q sed can be calculated by equations 5 8 5 q s e d λ r n d s 0 5 a c e 6 d s d m θ 2 7 θ 2 1 ln φ 2 8 log d m 980 t w 1 59 where c e is the rn activity in the embayment 11 2 2 0 dpm l 1 n 24 d s is the radon molecular diffusion coefficient in wet bulk sediment and for a given solute d s can be estimated by d m which is the radon molecular diffusion coefficient in pure water as described in equation 6 schulz 2006 lee et al 2012 in equation 6 θ is the tortuosity of seabed sediments which is a function of sediment porosity ϕ as shown in equation 7 boudreau 1996 in this study ϕ is adopted as 0 35 d m is a function of water temperature which is deployed as 303 06 k therefore the q sed is estimated to be 613 0 22 4 dpm d 1 m 2 i is calculated by multiplying rn activity in the embayment with the mean depth of harbour water 12 m leading to an estimation of 24261 2 4235 4 dpm d 1 m 2 q atm can be calculated by equation 9 9 q a

s solubility coefficient with a value of 0 22 in 25 c and c atm represents the rn activity in the ambient air c atm is adopted as 0 47 0 35 dpm l 1 luo et al 2011 the rn atmospheric evasion loss q atm is then calculated to be 2412 0 40 8 dpm d 1 m 2 with the rn activity in the harbour water and open seawater to be 11 2 2 0 dpm l 1 n 24 and 4 6 1 2 dpm l 1 n 5 respectively i ex is estimated to be 79320 8760 dpm m 2 based on estimation of each sink and source item in equation 4 the total sgd for 2018 is calculated to be 14 6 cm d by rn mass model 3 3 water balance model in this study water balance model is applied to estimate fsgd in tolo harbour as expressed in equation 10 10 q f p r q r e δ s where q f is the fsgd flux p r is the precipitation q r is the runoff discharge e is the evapotranspiration and δs is the change flux in storage of groundwater the unit is set to m3 yr 1 for each component in this study the fsgd of 2005 2011 and 2018 were calculated by water balance model the values of precipitation p r and evapotranspiration e were adopted from 10 year averaged data from hko δs can be negligible under a consideration of a constant groundwater storage over a long period each component of water balance model is listed in the table s2 finally q f is estimated to be 2 18 108 m3 yr 1 1 84 108 m3 yr 1 and 1 88 108 m3 yr 1 for 2005 2011 and 2018 respectively the estimated fsgd in tolo harbour is comparable with results of luo et al 2014 0 77 2 00 108 m3yr 1 in 2011 using radium mass balance model and liu et al 2018 5 03 5 99 107 m3 yr 1 in 2016 by darcy s law 3 4 rn activity regression model a total of 35 coastal rn samples collected from the 3rd 4th and 5th segment in 2005 2011 and 2018 table s3 were respectively used for rn activity regression models in this study two kinds of regression models are employed for different segments 1 type a regression model between ta and total sgd and 2 type b regression model between ta and fsgd hereby the rn activity is selected as the proxy of sgd and fsgd for type a model the ta is directly associated with the in situ rn activity for each sampling site for type b model the percentage of fsgd accounting for total sgd is adopted as the correction coefficient to calculate the rn activity derived from fsgd in the three sampling years the correction coefficients are respectively 10 1 13 8 and 7 0 for 2005 2011 and 2018 based on the water balance model table s2 for both types a strong positive linear correlation between the absolute value of ta and rn activity can be found table 2 fig 3 revealing that the rn activity enrichment represents an enhanced change in surface water temperature as shown in table 2 the coefficient of determination r2 for both models are within a range of 0 41 0 80 p 0 05 which implies the regression model are reliable and exploitable r2 for type b regression model is better than type a in all three segments which implies the surface water temperature changes are predominantly controlled by fsgd the slope of k for each segment fig 3 is likely associated with the water depths the k represents the total amount of groundwater discharge for per unit change of surface water temperature for the high slope k 5 40 in the 3rd segment the averaged water depth is highest nearly 8 m while the averaged water depths for 4th and 5th segments are 2 4 m with the k of 1 08 and 1 16 respectively dong 2010 moreover the performance of type b regression models is much improved compared to the results of wilson and rocha 2016 who were the first to discuss the relationship between rn activity and temperature anomaly thus type b models are further deployed in this study to generate two decade variations of fsgd based on which their ecological effects can be explored fig 4 presents the estimated rn activities derived from fsgd referred to as fsgd 222rn activity hereafter using type b models for each segment on march 5 2005 4 discussion 4 1 analysis of landsat thermal images among the total 159 suitable clear sky landsat thermal images 158 images are found applicable for 3rd and 4th segments and 157 images for 5th segment due to the partial cloud cover the numbers of monthly clear sky landsat thermal images from 1998 to 2017 are shown in fig 5 which suggests that the spring season march to may has limited clear sky thermal images as over 70 days of this period are covered by heavy clouds however this period witnesses highest algal bloom outbreaks cheng et al 2020 4 2 two decade variations of fsgd 222rn activity the regression models of fsgd 222rn activity were applied to all clear sky landsat thermal images in the three segments the monthly averaged fsgd 222rn activity of each segment was used in the following discussions fig 6 shows the relationships between the fsgd 222rn activity with monthly rainfall the seasonal variations of the fsgd 222rn activity can be observed with identifiable patterns for three segments during may june and september october the fsgd 222rn activity is much larger than the other months and the highest fsgd 222rn activity is shown in september moreover a time lag between the fsgd and total rainfall or the fsgd and the difference between rainfall and evapotranspiration fig s2 can be observed for dry seasons likely due to the gentle rainfall during the period while for rain seasons the phenomena of the time lag is complex likely due to the frequent and extreme rainfall the inter annual variability of sgd especially fsgd is highly subject to rainfall and evapotranspiration wilson 2005 destouni et al 2008 anderson and emanuel 2010 spatially the fsgd 222rn activity in the 3rd segment is nearly 3 times higher than the other two segments even for low fsgd 222rn activity period from november to march this phenomenon is most likely ascribed to much high catchment recharge areas for 3rd segment compared to that of the other two 4 3 ecological effects associated with fsgd 222rn activity 4 3 1 fsgd 222rn activity algal cell counts and chlorophyll a algal cell counts and chlorophyll a concentration are the indicators of algal blooms and highly related to nutrient concentrations fsgd can serve as one major nutrient source to coastal areas mounting profound effects on the ecological system in situ data of algal cell counts chlorophyll a and coastal nutrients i e the dissolved inorganic nitrogen din from 1998 to 2017 are summarized in table s4 and fig 7 shows the two decade dynamics of three ecological metrics the algal cell counts log value chlorophyll a concentrations log value and e coli concentrations log value with the fsgd 222rn activity from 1998 to 2017 in the three segments the algal cell counts and chlorophyll a concentration distributions were well coincident with fsgd 222rn activity highest concentrations in the 3rd segment compared to the other two segments the sampling frequency for three ecological metrics ranges from weekly to seasonally for the sake of paring with the monthly fsgd 222rn activity results three ecological metrics data were monthly bin averaged for the convenience of discussion it is noted that the concurrent changes of algal cell counts and fsgd 222rn activity present in all segments from the two decade time span the effects of a long time gap between the in situ data and satellite image time can result in significant errors during analysis and to reduce the uncertainties the time lag of paired data fsgd 222rn activity versus algal cell counts chlorophyll a and e coli in this study was set to be within 1 days le et al 2013 fig 8 shows the correlation between the algal cell counts log value and the fsgd 222rn activity in different segments a positive relationship was observed between the fsgd 222rn activity and algal cell counts for each segment fig 8 a c however the correlation between algal cell counts and fsgd 222rn activity combining all three segments was unidentifiable fig 8 d this is probably ascribed to the fact that different dominant algae species among the segments have different priorities in consuming the nutrients derived from fsgd wong and wong 2004 it is also likely that different algal species might response differently to nutrient species for examples diatom is mainly controlled by no3 liang et al 2020 fig 9 shows the relationship between the chlorophyll a concentrations and the fsgd 222rn activity in the three segments the same results can be observed that chlorophyll a is positively correlated with fsgd however the fsgd 222rn activity is weakly correlated with chlorophyll a concentrations compared to its correlation with algal cell counts this difference is stemmed from 1 the uncertainty for chlorophyll a detection and measurement is relatively high compared with that of algal cell counts and 2 the current time lag 1 days may not be suitable for chlorophyll a as it is highly sensitive and variable over time by integrating the chlorophyll a concentration data in three segments fig 9 d its correlation with fsgd 222rn activity slightly increases the main reason is that the pigment has no apparent differences among different algae species detailed information on correlation analysis is shown in table s5 4 3 2 fsgd and algal blooms in hong kong 944 red tide incidents were reported during 1975 2018 35 of the red tides occurred in tolo harbour afcd 2019 as aforementioned previous studies have indicated that groundwater borne nutrients likely contribute the red tide outbreaks however these studies are limited by few year records and hence their conclusions based on these limited data may not be convincing this study avoids these insufficiencies in plumbing the relation between fsgd and algal blooms over a long time period generally water temperate wind speed solar radiation stability of water column and sufficient nutrient supply all favor the blooming of red tides and peak nutrients will be normally observed 1 2 weeks ahead of the outbreaks and significantly depleted during the period of blooming lee et al 2003 therefore for the sake of investigating the impacts of fsgd derived din on the red tide outbreaks the paired din and fsgd 222rn activity of 10 20 days prior to the algal blooms are employed for the discussion in the 3rd segment among 44 algal blooms in the past 20 years there are 11 algal blooms with paired din versus fsgd 222rn activity records good positive correlation with a r2 of 0 78 p 0 05 was obtained between them fig 10 a similarly for 4th and 5th segments good relations with a r2 of 0 69 p 0 05 and 0 76 p 0 05 were respectively observed based on 12 of 35 algal blooms for 4th segment and 12 out of 22 algal blooms for 5th segment in the study period fig 10 b c compiling all the applicable paired din versus fsgd 222rn activity a good positive correlation r2 0 77 p 0 05 fig 10 d was also obtained between them fsgd 222rn activity has significantly high correlation with din compared with that between fsgd 222rn activity and algal cell counts r2 0 16 and that between fsgd 222rn activity chlorophyll a concentrations r2 0 39 the causative factor for these different correlations is that fsgd usually mounts direct effects on din concentrations but influences the dynamics of chlorophyll a and algal cell counts indirectly 4 3 3 fsgd versus e coli as aforementioned e coli is a crucial bacteria indicator for water quality widely used in swimming associated illness study and coastal fishery management markošová and jeẑek 1994 based on the government annual grading system epd 2019 levels of e coli 25 cfu 100 ml 25 180 cfu 100 ml 181 610 cfu 100 ml and 610 cfu 100 ml are assigned to good fair poor and very poor levels respectively accordingly e coli concentrations in surface sea water of the three segments are yielded and listed in table s4 the e coli concentration in the 3rd segment is highest in consistence with the highest chlorophyll a and algal blooms outbreaks this suggests the water quality and ecological condition are worst in 3rd segment as a result of combining effects of anthropogenic activities such as fishing farm domestic and industrial sewage release natural processes of sgd hydroclimatological dynamics and physical ocean fluctuations hu et al 2006 fig 11 shows the fsgd 222rn activity in relation to the coastal surface water e coli concentrations in this study the minimum threshold for e coli concentration of 25 cfu 100 ml fair to very poor levels was adopted below which the environmental effects of e coli are negligible the time lag of paired e coli versus fsgd 222rn data is also set to be within 1 days a positive linear correlation with r2 of 0 36 0 84 p 0 05 suggests that the high fsgd most likely leads to the increase of e coli concentration fig 11 this result could be ascribed to two reasons 1 high nutrient loadings i e din will be derived from increased fgsd as described in section 4 3 2 fig 10 favoring the persistence and growth of e coli in tolo harbour and 2 coastal groundwater can be regarded as a potential e coli source the second speculation can be validated by the field observation of groundwater e coli fig 12 exhibits the monthly monitoring of e coli concentration during 1993 and 1996 from the observation well at the lam tsuen river fig 1 which is adjacent to the epd monitoring station of tm3 therefore the data of coastal e coli concentration in tm3 are compared with that from observation well based on 4 year field data most of e coli concentration in groundwater is more than 2 times higher than that in ambient seawater fig 12 implying that the groundwater served as the source of e coli in the tolo harbour further studies are needed to quantitatively and qualitatively depict the influences of sgd on e coli dynamics in the coastal waters 4 4 conceptual model to this end a conceptual model is proposed to characterize the response of ecological metrics to hydroclimatological factors via fsgd using remote sensing approach as shown in fig 13 the variability of sgd especially its fresh component fsgd is highly subject to the combining effects of the dynamics of precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff precipitation exhibits positive effects with sgd and fsgd while evapotranspiration is negatively correlated with sgd and fsgd the variability of fsgd further leads to the fluctuation of groundwater borne nutrient in the harbour altering the trophic states and regulating the temporal distributions of these ecological metrics remote sensing approach can be used to extract the data of precipitation evapotranspiration and fsgd contributing to the extensive studies of the mechanism of fsgd dynamics the deployment of combined remote sensing approaches and traditional geo tracer approaches provides new methods for coastal hydrogeological studies 4 5 limitations and prospective this study is limited by the following aspects 1 the model training was carried out by limited rn samples over both spatial and temporal scales 2 the 30 m resolution of landsat thermal images is still too coarse to match with the sampling resolution 3 the time window between the satellite thermal images and in situ ground truthing data ranges from 0 to 17 days which is sort of large to pair with ground truthing data even given limited rn samples for model training this study still presents an exploitable regression model for fsgd estimation under the sampling time interval of 6 7 years over different seasons suggesting that remote sensing satellite thermal image is an acceptable approach for sgd estimation and the model is exploitable in the future intensive rn water sampling will be conducted for the model validation rn samples will be also collected at the same time with thermal images of satellite to avoid the influence of long time gap in addition to the satellite sensors more advanced remote sensing technology and platforms such as airborne and unmanned aerial vehicles will be employed in further studies 5 conclusions this study makes the first attempt to illustrate the applicability of using remote sensing approach to quantitatively map the fsgd variations over a decade time span seasonal oscillation of fsgd over a long time period in tolo harbour hong kong is obtained specifically the fsgd is much higher at wet seasons and peaked in september the segment with high frequency of algal blooms and high e coli concentrations is generally consistent with a high fsgd in the past 20 years it is considered that the fsgd could favor algal blooms and increase e coli concentrations by delivering sufficient nutrient into the coastal waters based on a long term observation fsgd and nutrient concentration approached highest levels about 10 20 days prior to each algal bloom the results of this study shed lights on the fishery management water security and sustainability of coastal ecosystem in tolo harbor and elsewhere declaration of competing interest the authors

17932,although submarine groundwater discharge sgd comprises an insignificant proportion of the global hydrologic cycle it contributes significantly to chemical fluxes into the coastal waters due to concentrated constituents in coastal groundwater large nutrient loadings derived from sgd can lead to a series of environmental and ecological problems such as algal blooms resulting in water discoloration severe dissolved oxygen depletion and eventually beach closures and massive fish kills previous studies have demonstrated the relationship between algal blooms and sgd obtained from direct measurement with seepage meters or from geo tracer i e radon and radium based models these traditional methods are time consuming laborious and point monitoring and can hardly achieve a high spatiotemporal resolution sgd estimation which is vital in revealing the effects of sgd to algal blooms over a long period alternatively remote sensing methods for high spatiotemporal resolution sgd localization and quantification are applicable and effective the temperature difference or anomaly between groundwater and coastal water extracted from satellite thermal images can be used as the indicator to localize and detect sgd especially its fresh component or fresh sgd in this study multi year 2005 2011 and 2018 radon samples in tolo harbour were used to train regression models between in situ radon rn activity and the temperature anomaly by landsat satellite thermal images the models were used to estimate two decade variations of fresh sgd in tolo harbour the synergistic analysis between the time series of fresh sgd derived from regression models and high spatiotemporal resolution ecological metrics chlorophyll a algal cell counts and e coli leads to the findings that the increase of the fresh sgd associated with high nutrient concentrations is witnessed 10 20 days before the observations of algal bloom events this study makes the first attempt to demonstrate the strong relation between the sgd and algal blooms over a vicennial span and also provides a cost effective and robust technique to estimate sgd on a bay scale graphical abstract image 1 keywords submarine groundwater discharge radon remote sensing algal blooms e coli 1 introduction 1 1 overview submarine groundwater discharge sgd is defined as the seaward flow of water across the sea and land interface it includes the fresh sgd fsgd originated from terrestrial recharge and a recirculated component originated from the sea taniguchi 2002 burnett et al 2003 jiao and post 2019 the massive nutrient loadings associated with sgd are a major source in the ocean hwang et al 2005a lee et al 2012 luo and jiao 2016 in addition to the riverine loadings benthic diffusions and atmospheric dry wet depositions wai et al 2010 kim and kim 2011 rodellas et al 2015 trezzi et al 2016 previous studies have revealed that groundwater borne nutrients are of significance for coastal ecological systems johannes 1980 lapointe 1997 paytan et al 2006 swarzenski et al 2007 lee et al 2009 smith and swarzenski 2012 liu et al 2018 on the one hand the groundwater borne nutrients are essential chemicals that support the primary production and growth of coral reefs in oceans on the other hand excessive nutrient loading potentially leads to some ecological and environmental problems such as eutrophication algal blooms and degradation of coral reefs laroche et al 1997 lee and arega 1999 hwang et al 2005a 2005b lee and kim 2007 lee et al 2010 algal blooms or red tides as a global ecological concern can cause water discoloration and severe dissolved oxygen depletion a large proportion of red tides induced by k brevis kill fish by excreting neurotoxins algal blooms or red tides occur frequently in hong kong and present formidable challenges to coastal safety a total of 944 algal blooms have been reported from 1975 to 2018 in hong kong by agriculture fisheries and conservation department afcd phytoplankton or algae plays a vital role in the coastal ecosystems which are strongly affected by the freshwater inputs such as fsgd adolf et al 2019 some studies have identified the linkage between the groundwater borne nutrients and algal blooms hu et al 2006 lee et al 2010 lecher et al 2015 luo and jiao 2016 adolf et al 2019 the sgd estimates in these studies are within a short time span and these traditional methods based on the direct measurements by seepage meters or tracer techniques such as radon and radium are time consuming and laborious in addition to the aforementioned sgd effect on algal blooms coastal groundwater has been proven elsewhere to be the sources of fecal indicator bacteria fib which is the sum of total coliform tc fecal coliform fc and enterococcus ent fib is highly influential to the public health and fishery management boehm et al 2003 2004 2009 knee et al 2008 page et al 2012 yau et al 2014 some governments such as america and hong kong select the escherichia coli e coli one subgroup of fc as the bacteria indicator for public health of coastal water quality due to the significant correlation with swimming associated illness such as skin and gastrointestinal illnesses cheung et al 1990 and coastal fishery management markošová and jeẑek 1994 in hong kong e coli is monitored and detected monthly in stream beach and harbour waters by environment protection department epd since 1986 1 2 remote sensing for sgd estimation different from traditional methods remote sensing approach for sgd detection and quantification are more applicable and effective in long term monitoring the temperature differences between the discharged terrestrial groundwater and coastal seawater can indicate the sgd rates dale and miller 2007 the fresh groundwater is less dense than seawater so sgd especially for fsgd will be buoyant on the surface layer of seawater in general thermal remote sensing of sea surface temperature sst only reveals and delineates the temperatures at skin level water column 0 1 mm below the water surface handcock et al 2006 the sgd estimation from temperature differences hence represents mainly fsgd although some previous studies directly linked the temperature gradients to total sgd rates remote sensing methods have been successfully applied to delineate the interactions between the groundwater discharge and surface waters in different aquatic systems i e lakes and coastal waters shaban et al 2005 tcherepanov et al 2005 wilson and rocha 2012 2016 mallast et al 2013 2014 to date the remote sensing platforms mainly include satellites and airborne platforms the airborne platforms can easily mount the high spatial resolution thermal sensors with a frequent temporal deployment therefore most previous studies predominantly acquire and analyze the thermal infrared tir images collected from aerial surveys however airborne platforms are difficult to take tir images with a large spatial coverage such as estuaries or coasts in contrast satellites can provide longer continuous services and observations for sufficiently large spatial coverage while the limitation is the spatial and temporal resolutions for most satellite sensors are coarse compared to the airborne ones there have been still some encouraging results from the usgs series of landsat satellites which provide thermal images with a 60 m spatial resolution that then can be rebuilt to 30 m resolution bobba et al 1992 firstly used landsat 1 thermal images from march to july in 1974 to investigate the seasonal variations of groundwater discharge in southern ontario canada tcherepanov et al 2005 combined landsat tm thermal images under different weather conditions from 1989 to 2002 with ground based observations on lake temperatures to identify lacustrine groundwater discharge their study assigned lake zones with consistently cold temperatures to be potential groundwater zones shaban et al 2005 adopted both landsat and aerial images to localize sgd sites and submarine springs in north lebanon wang et al 2008 localized the groundwater discharge points in the delaware s inland bays using two landsat 7 emt tir images january 2000 and february 2002 and then investigated the ecological effects related to the groundwater discharge mallast et al 2013 also employed landsat 7 emt tir images within 2000 2011 to visualize the sgd sites and study the temporal variations of sgd along the entire dead sea coasts further attempts have been made by researchers to quantitatively plumb the groundwater discharge using coupled remote sensing and geotracer models radon rn is an ideal tracer to evaluate surface water and groundwater interactions burnett and dulaiova 2003 the rn activity in groundwater is generally several orders of magnitude higher than rn in surface waters exhibiting a sharp activity gradient at the surface groundwater interface schmidt et al 2009 therefore some recent studies started to associate the temperature anomaly ta derived from landsat images to rn wilson and rocha 2012 carried out a regional scale assessment of sgd locations in ireland using a total of 6 landsat 7 emt tir images collected in summer seasons may to august from 1999 to 2010 in their study 35 potential sgd sites were detected through tir images and verified with rn wilson and rocha 2016 further quantitatively studied the relationship between ta caused by groundwater discharge and rn activity in lough mask lake using 4 landsat 7 emt tir images in summer seasons may to july from 1999 to 2010 they found an anti correlation between the ta and rn activities with a correlation coefficient r2 ranging from 0 34 to 0 56 however there have been still limited studies to investigate the inter annual variability of groundwater discharge with high spatiotemporal landsat images and trained with sufficient rn samples over different years this paper presents a coupled remote sensing 222rn tracer model to estimate the variations of fsgd from 1998 to 2017 in tolo harbour and to explore the relationships between fsgd and some ecological metrics such as the algal blooms and fib based on a two decade dataset it is believed that the cost effective and robust remote sensing technique complements traditional methods to estimate sgd and investigate further its ecological significance of sgd 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area tolo harbour a land locked tidal estuary in the northeastern part of hong kong is extended around 20 km from southwest to northeast and it connects to mirs bay with a narrow tolo channel with a width less than 1 5 km choi and lee 2004 tolo harbour has a surface area of 50 km2 with a total catchment area of 160 km2 and a shoreline of 82 km lee et al 2012 luo et al 2014 based on different water flushing times tolo harbour can be divided into 7 segments fig 1 jirka and lee 1994 the mean sea level is 1 45 m above principal datum mpd and the average tidal range is 1 06 m data from hong kong observatory hko the water depths of tolo harbour range from 2 m to 8 m dong 2010 six main rivers and streams namely lam tsuen lt river shan liu sl stream shing mum sm river tai po tp river tai po kau tpk stream and tung tze tt stream empty into the inner harbour fig 1 the rocks around the harbor are comprised of middle jurassic lower cretaceous volcanic rocks devonian sedimentary rocks middle jurassic lower cretaceous plutonic rocks small scale quaternary deposits and reclaimed lands a series of faults trending northeast and northwest were generated the largest fault is the lai chi kok tolo channel fault which belongs to a fault zone extending across sha tin valley to tolo channel tse and jiao 2008 2 2 satellite thermal image acquisition a total of 159 landsat thermal images landsat 5tm landsat 7 etm and landsat 8 oli which are largely clouds free over 3rd 4th and 5th segments in tolo harbour were obtained from the usgs earth explorer website http earthexplorer usgs gov from 1998 to 2017 the spatial resolution of landsat thermal images was all rebuilt to 30 m the imagery was acquired at the local time 10 30 h these thermal images were used to retrieve the sst and ta maps to localize and assess the fsgd to the harbour three landsat clear sky images captured closest to three field trip dates respectively on 5 march 2005 3 july 2011 and 7 august 2018 were used for the generation of regression models with ground truthing rn samples hence the time windows between the imaged time and in situ field data time for each sampling event were 0 8 and 17 days respectively much longer time window in 2018 was ascribed to extensive cloud cover induced by the typhoon mangkhut around the field trip period 2 3 sst mapping all landsat thermal images were processed to generate sst map using the environment for visualizing images envi the methodology for retrieval of surface temperature from landsat 5 tm band 6 data landsat 7 etm band 6 data and landsat 8 oli band 10 11 data is presented in details in previous studies and official released handbooks by nasa thomas et al 2002 barsi et al 2003 wilson and rocha 2012 2016 landsat project science office 2003 2019 briefly first the raw thermal data dn is converted to top of atmosphere toa radiance value which is a mixed radiance of three different types of energy emitted radiance from the earth surface upwelling radiance from the atmosphere and downwelling radiance from the air then the atmospheric correction is undertaken for the toa radiance to determine the surface water radiance l λt using equation 1 with the atmospheric correction parameters extracted from an online website tool by nasa 1 l λ t l λ t o a l λ u p τ ε 1 ε 1 l λ d o w n where l λt represents the surface radiance of a blackbody target of kinetic temperature t w μm sr m2 l λtoa is toa recorded by the sensor w μm sr m2 l λup and l λdown are the upwelling and downwelling radiance w μm sr m2 respectively ε is the atmospheric transmission τ is the water emissivity constant of 0 989 snyder et al 1998 srivastava et al 2009 wilson and rocha 2012 wilson and rocha 2016 finally the surface temperature t ss can be converted from the atmospherically corrected surface water radiance with equation 2 2 t s s k 2 ln k 1 l λ t 1 where t ss is the surface sea temperature k k 1 w μm sr m2 and k 2 k are thermal conversion constants as listed in the process manual released by landsat project science office after the sst retrieval of all satellite thermal images a validation was carried out between the retrieved temperatures with the surface coastal temperature data collected from hko 2 4 ta mapping the temperature difference between surface seawater and groundwater can be regarded as one of the indicators to localize the sgd especially for its fresh component for hong kong coastal waters the temperature of groundwater is normally higher than the surface coastal waters in winter while lower in summer for a better discussion the ta calculation is adapted from wilson and rocha 2012 wilson and rocha 2016 to avoid the negative ta over different seasons 3 t a t i p t where ta represents temperature anomaly c which is the absolute value of the temperature difference between the sst of each pixel t ip extracted from the processed satellite images and the concurrent average sst t recorded by hko 2 5 rn measurement and analysis three field trips were respectively carried out on 5 march 2005 11 july 2011 and 24 august 2018 rn samples were taken from seawater river and stream water and groundwater rn samples of seawater and river water were measured by rad7 big bottle system and rn samples in groundwater were measured by rad h2o lee and kim 2007 all rn samples were analyzed within 3 days after the sampling to avoid significant decay loss finally a total of 35 rn samples were obtained from surface seawater in the three study areas of the 3rd 4th and 5th segments fig 1 2 6 time series data ten parameters of water quality hydrometeorology and red tide metrics from 1998 to 2017 were retrieved from several hong kong government departments the coastal nutrient data were compiled from records of epd marine stations tm3 tm5 and tm7 fig 1 and records from three fish culture zones fcz by afcd the algal cell counts chlorophyll a concentrations and red tide records were also collected from afcd coastal and riverine e coli concentrations and runoff data were extracted from epd groundwater e coli concentrations were extracted from civil engineering and development department cedd the water quality parameters were measured based on international standard methods epd 2019 hydrometeorological data including daily seawater temperature rainfall evapotranspiration and precipitation were retrieved from hong kong observatory hko specifically daily rainfall data were obtained from 6 auto recorded weather stations installed within the tolo harbour water control zones daily evapotranspiration and seawater temperature data were collected from the station installed at king s park which is about 10 km from tolo harbour 3 results 3 1 sst and ta mapping table 1 shows the satellite derived information of three landsat thermal images respectively captured on 5 march 2005 3 july 2011 and 7 august 2018 as this study involved different seasons the satellite derived averaged sst minimum values ranged from 12 3 c to 24 3 c sst maximum values were between 15 6 c and 30 6 c fig s1 shows relationship between sst retrieved from satellite images and hko data 1 m below water surface for three segments the sst results were further validated by quantitative correlation analysis as shown in fig 2 the cold water plumes presented adjacent to the shorelines in summer i e july and august and warm water plumes shown in march with cold weather ta ranged from 0 04 c march to 4 2 c august as a reference the average groundwater temperatures near tolo harbour fig 1 were recorded by cedd during 1993 and 1996 in the range of 13 8 c and 28 5 c 3 2 steady state rn mass balance model rn activities of the harbour water open seawater river and coastal groundwater in 2005 2011 can be found in luo and jiao 2016 and data for 2018 are shown in table s1 notably the activity of rn in harbour water is much lower than those from river and groundwater and the averaged radon activity in surface harbour water in 2005 25 8 6 5 dpm l 1 was higher than 2011 and 2018 19 7 4 7 dpm l 1 11 2 2 0 dpm l 1 respectively rn is mainly sourced from total sgd porewater diffusion and surface runoff and lost by radioactive decay tidal flushing and atmospheric evasion tse and jiao 2008 kim and kim 2011 the total sgd in 2005 and 2011 was 11 8 cm d in 2005 and 7 3 cm d in 2011 respectively based on the radon mass balance model of previous study in tolo harbour luo and jiao 2016 the total sgd in 2018 is quantified using equation 4 4 d r n d t a q s g d q r i v e r q s e d i λ r n q a t m i e x λ m i x 0 where a is the rn activity in the groundwater end member which is 233 9 10 1 dpm l 1 n 4 q river is riverine contribution to harbour water rn inventory and is calculated to be 178 5 9 6 dpm d 1 m 2 by multiplying the averaged rn activity in river water 132 4 7 1 dpm l 1 n 3 with the 10 year averaged runoff 67413 96 m3 d 1 q sed dpm d 1 m 2

q atm dpm d 1 m 2 is the rn atmospheric evasion loss i ex dpm m 2 is the rn inventory excess between open seawater and embayment water λ mix is the tidal mixing rate or the reciprocal of harbour water residence time 0 105 d 1 jirka and lee 1994 in the mass balance model q sed can be calculated by equations 5 8 5 q s e d λ r n d s 0 5 a c e 6 d s d m θ 2 7 θ 2 1 ln φ 2 8 log d m 980 t w 1 59 where c e is the rn activity in the embayment 11 2 2 0 dpm l 1 n 24 d s is the radon molecular diffusion coefficient in wet bulk sediment and for a given solute d s can be estimated by d m which is the radon molecular diffusion coefficient in pure water as described in equation 6 schulz 2006 lee et al 2012 in equation 6 θ is the tortuosity of seabed sediments which is a function of sediment porosity ϕ as shown in equation 7 boudreau 1996 in this study ϕ is adopted as 0 35 d m is a function of water temperature which is deployed as 303 06 k therefore the q sed is estimated to be 613 0 22 4 dpm d 1 m 2 i is calculated by multiplying rn activity in the embayment with the mean depth of harbour water 12 m leading to an estimation of 24261 2 4235 4 dpm d 1 m 2 q atm can be calculated by equation 9 9 q a

s solubility coefficient with a value of 0 22 in 25 c and c atm represents the rn activity in the ambient air c atm is adopted as 0 47 0 35 dpm l 1 luo et al 2011 the rn atmospheric evasion loss q atm is then calculated to be 2412 0 40 8 dpm d 1 m 2 with the rn activity in the harbour water and open seawater to be 11 2 2 0 dpm l 1 n 24 and 4 6 1 2 dpm l 1 n 5 respectively i ex is estimated to be 79320 8760 dpm m 2 based on estimation of each sink and source item in equation 4 the total sgd for 2018 is calculated to be 14 6 cm d by rn mass model 3 3 water balance model in this study water balance model is applied to estimate fsgd in tolo harbour as expressed in equation 10 10 q f p r q r e δ s where q f is the fsgd flux p r is the precipitation q r is the runoff discharge e is the evapotranspiration and δs is the change flux in storage of groundwater the unit is set to m3 yr 1 for each component in this study the fsgd of 2005 2011 and 2018 were calculated by water balance model the values of precipitation p r and evapotranspiration e were adopted from 10 year averaged data from hko δs can be negligible under a consideration of a constant groundwater storage over a long period each component of water balance model is listed in the table s2 finally q f is estimated to be 2 18 108 m3 yr 1 1 84 108 m3 yr 1 and 1 88 108 m3 yr 1 for 2005 2011 and 2018 respectively the estimated fsgd in tolo harbour is comparable with results of luo et al 2014 0 77 2 00 108 m3yr 1 in 2011 using radium mass balance model and liu et al 2018 5 03 5 99 107 m3 yr 1 in 2016 by darcy s law 3 4 rn activity regression model a total of 35 coastal rn samples collected from the 3rd 4th and 5th segment in 2005 2011 and 2018 table s3 were respectively used for rn activity regression models in this study two kinds of regression models are employed for different segments 1 type a regression model between ta and total sgd and 2 type b regression model between ta and fsgd hereby the rn activity is selected as the proxy of sgd and fsgd for type a model the ta is directly associated with the in situ rn activity for each sampling site for type b model the percentage of fsgd accounting for total sgd is adopted as the correction coefficient to calculate the rn activity derived from fsgd in the three sampling years the correction coefficients are respectively 10 1 13 8 and 7 0 for 2005 2011 and 2018 based on the water balance model table s2 for both types a strong positive linear correlation between the absolute value of ta and rn activity can be found table 2 fig 3 revealing that the rn activity enrichment represents an enhanced change in surface water temperature as shown in table 2 the coefficient of determination r2 for both models are within a range of 0 41 0 80 p 0 05 which implies the regression model are reliable and exploitable r2 for type b regression model is better than type a in all three segments which implies the surface water temperature changes are predominantly controlled by fsgd the slope of k for each segment fig 3 is likely associated with the water depths the k represents the total amount of groundwater discharge for per unit change of surface water temperature for the high slope k 5 40 in the 3rd segment the averaged water depth is highest nearly 8 m while the averaged water depths for 4th and 5th segments are 2 4 m with the k of 1 08 and 1 16 respectively dong 2010 moreover the performance of type b regression models is much improved compared to the results of wilson and rocha 2016 who were the first to discuss the relationship between rn activity and temperature anomaly thus type b models are further deployed in this study to generate two decade variations of fsgd based on which their ecological effects can be explored fig 4 presents the estimated rn activities derived from fsgd referred to as fsgd 222rn activity hereafter using type b models for each segment on march 5 2005 4 discussion 4 1 analysis of landsat thermal images among the total 159 suitable clear sky landsat thermal images 158 images are found applicable for 3rd and 4th segments and 157 images for 5th segment due to the partial cloud cover the numbers of monthly clear sky landsat thermal images from 1998 to 2017 are shown in fig 5 which suggests that the spring season march to may has limited clear sky thermal images as over 70 days of this period are covered by heavy clouds however this period witnesses highest algal bloom outbreaks cheng et al 2020 4 2 two decade variations of fsgd 222rn activity the regression models of fsgd 222rn activity were applied to all clear sky landsat thermal images in the three segments the monthly averaged fsgd 222rn activity of each segment was used in the following discussions fig 6 shows the relationships between the fsgd 222rn activity with monthly rainfall the seasonal variations of the fsgd 222rn activity can be observed with identifiable patterns for three segments during may june and september october the fsgd 222rn activity is much larger than the other months and the highest fsgd 222rn activity is shown in september moreover a time lag between the fsgd and total rainfall or the fsgd and the difference between rainfall and evapotranspiration fig s2 can be observed for dry seasons likely due to the gentle rainfall during the period while for rain seasons the phenomena of the time lag is complex likely due to the frequent and extreme rainfall the inter annual variability of sgd especially fsgd is highly subject to rainfall and evapotranspiration wilson 2005 destouni et al 2008 anderson and emanuel 2010 spatially the fsgd 222rn activity in the 3rd segment is nearly 3 times higher than the other two segments even for low fsgd 222rn activity period from november to march this phenomenon is most likely ascribed to much high catchment recharge areas for 3rd segment compared to that of the other two 4 3 ecological effects associated with fsgd 222rn activity 4 3 1 fsgd 222rn activity algal cell counts and chlorophyll a algal cell counts and chlorophyll a concentration are the indicators of algal blooms and highly related to nutrient concentrations fsgd can serve as one major nutrient source to coastal areas mounting profound effects on the ecological system in situ data of algal cell counts chlorophyll a and coastal nutrients i e the dissolved inorganic nitrogen din from 1998 to 2017 are summarized in table s4 and fig 7 shows the two decade dynamics of three ecological metrics the algal cell counts log value chlorophyll a concentrations log value and e coli concentrations log value with the fsgd 222rn activity from 1998 to 2017 in the three segments the algal cell counts and chlorophyll a concentration distributions were well coincident with fsgd 222rn activity highest concentrations in the 3rd segment compared to the other two segments the sampling frequency for three ecological metrics ranges from weekly to seasonally for the sake of paring with the monthly fsgd 222rn activity results three ecological metrics data were monthly bin averaged for the convenience of discussion it is noted that the concurrent changes of algal cell counts and fsgd 222rn activity present in all segments from the two decade time span the effects of a long time gap between the in situ data and satellite image time can result in significant errors during analysis and to reduce the uncertainties the time lag of paired data fsgd 222rn activity versus algal cell counts chlorophyll a and e coli in this study was set to be within 1 days le et al 2013 fig 8 shows the correlation between the algal cell counts log value and the fsgd 222rn activity in different segments a positive relationship was observed between the fsgd 222rn activity and algal cell counts for each segment fig 8 a c however the correlation between algal cell counts and fsgd 222rn activity combining all three segments was unidentifiable fig 8 d this is probably ascribed to the fact that different dominant algae species among the segments have different priorities in consuming the nutrients derived from fsgd wong and wong 2004 it is also likely that different algal species might response differently to nutrient species for examples diatom is mainly controlled by no3 liang et al 2020 fig 9 shows the relationship between the chlorophyll a concentrations and the fsgd 222rn activity in the three segments the same results can be observed that chlorophyll a is positively correlated with fsgd however the fsgd 222rn activity is weakly correlated with chlorophyll a concentrations compared to its correlation with algal cell counts this difference is stemmed from 1 the uncertainty for chlorophyll a detection and measurement is relatively high compared with that of algal cell counts and 2 the current time lag 1 days may not be suitable for chlorophyll a as it is highly sensitive and variable over time by integrating the chlorophyll a concentration data in three segments fig 9 d its correlation with fsgd 222rn activity slightly increases the main reason is that the pigment has no apparent differences among different algae species detailed information on correlation analysis is shown in table s5 4 3 2 fsgd and algal blooms in hong kong 944 red tide incidents were reported during 1975 2018 35 of the red tides occurred in tolo harbour afcd 2019 as aforementioned previous studies have indicated that groundwater borne nutrients likely contribute the red tide outbreaks however these studies are limited by few year records and hence their conclusions based on these limited data may not be convincing this study avoids these insufficiencies in plumbing the relation between fsgd and algal blooms over a long time period generally water temperate wind speed solar radiation stability of water column and sufficient nutrient supply all favor the blooming of red tides and peak nutrients will be normally observed 1 2 weeks ahead of the outbreaks and significantly depleted during the period of blooming lee et al 2003 therefore for the sake of investigating the impacts of fsgd derived din on the red tide outbreaks the paired din and fsgd 222rn activity of 10 20 days prior to the algal blooms are employed for the discussion in the 3rd segment among 44 algal blooms in the past 20 years there are 11 algal blooms with paired din versus fsgd 222rn activity records good positive correlation with a r2 of 0 78 p 0 05 was obtained between them fig 10 a similarly for 4th and 5th segments good relations with a r2 of 0 69 p 0 05 and 0 76 p 0 05 were respectively observed based on 12 of 35 algal blooms for 4th segment and 12 out of 22 algal blooms for 5th segment in the study period fig 10 b c compiling all the applicable paired din versus fsgd 222rn activity a good positive correlation r2 0 77 p 0 05 fig 10 d was also obtained between them fsgd 222rn activity has significantly high correlation with din compared with that between fsgd 222rn activity and algal cell counts r2 0 16 and that between fsgd 222rn activity chlorophyll a concentrations r2 0 39 the causative factor for these different correlations is that fsgd usually mounts direct effects on din concentrations but influences the dynamics of chlorophyll a and algal cell counts indirectly 4 3 3 fsgd versus e coli as aforementioned e coli is a crucial bacteria indicator for water quality widely used in swimming associated illness study and coastal fishery management markošová and jeẑek 1994 based on the government annual grading system epd 2019 levels of e coli 25 cfu 100 ml 25 180 cfu 100 ml 181 610 cfu 100 ml and 610 cfu 100 ml are assigned to good fair poor and very poor levels respectively accordingly e coli concentrations in surface sea water of the three segments are yielded and listed in table s4 the e coli concentration in the 3rd segment is highest in consistence with the highest chlorophyll a and algal blooms outbreaks this suggests the water quality and ecological condition are worst in 3rd segment as a result of combining effects of anthropogenic activities such as fishing farm domestic and industrial sewage release natural processes of sgd hydroclimatological dynamics and physical ocean fluctuations hu et al 2006 fig 11 shows the fsgd 222rn activity in relation to the coastal surface water e coli concentrations in this study the minimum threshold for e coli concentration of 25 cfu 100 ml fair to very poor levels was adopted below which the environmental effects of e coli are negligible the time lag of paired e coli versus fsgd 222rn data is also set to be within 1 days a positive linear correlation with r2 of 0 36 0 84 p 0 05 suggests that the high fsgd most likely leads to the increase of e coli concentration fig 11 this result could be ascribed to two reasons 1 high nutrient loadings i e din will be derived from increased fgsd as described in section 4 3 2 fig 10 favoring the persistence and growth of e coli in tolo harbour and 2 coastal groundwater can be regarded as a potential e coli source the second speculation can be validated by the field observation of groundwater e coli fig 12 exhibits the monthly monitoring of e coli concentration during 1993 and 1996 from the observation well at the lam tsuen river fig 1 which is adjacent to the epd monitoring station of tm3 therefore the data of coastal e coli concentration in tm3 are compared with that from observation well based on 4 year field data most of e coli concentration in groundwater is more than 2 times higher than that in ambient seawater fig 12 implying that the groundwater served as the source of e coli in the tolo harbour further studies are needed to quantitatively and qualitatively depict the influences of sgd on e coli dynamics in the coastal waters 4 4 conceptual model to this end a conceptual model is proposed to characterize the response of ecological metrics to hydroclimatological factors via fsgd using remote sensing approach as shown in fig 13 the variability of sgd especially its fresh component fsgd is highly subject to the combining effects of the dynamics of precipitation evapotranspiration and runoff precipitation exhibits positive effects with sgd and fsgd while evapotranspiration is negatively correlated with sgd and fsgd the variability of fsgd further leads to the fluctuation of groundwater borne nutrient in the harbour altering the trophic states and regulating the temporal distributions of these ecological metrics remote sensing approach can be used to extract the data of precipitation evapotranspiration and fsgd contributing to the extensive studies of the mechanism of fsgd dynamics the deployment of combined remote sensing approaches and traditional geo tracer approaches provides new methods for coastal hydrogeological studies 4 5 limitations and prospective this study is limited by the following aspects 1 the model training was carried out by limited rn samples over both spatial and temporal scales 2 the 30 m resolution of landsat thermal images is still too coarse to match with the sampling resolution 3 the time window between the satellite thermal images and in situ ground truthing data ranges from 0 to 17 days which is sort of large to pair with ground truthing data even given limited rn samples for model training this study still presents an exploitable regression model for fsgd estimation under the sampling time interval of 6 7 years over different seasons suggesting that remote sensing satellite thermal image is an acceptable approach for sgd estimation and the model is exploitable in the future intensive rn water sampling will be conducted for the model validation rn samples will be also collected at the same time with thermal images of satellite to avoid the influence of long time gap in addition to the satellite sensors more advanced remote sensing technology and platforms such as airborne and unmanned aerial vehicles will be employed in further studies 5 conclusions this study makes the first attempt to illustrate the applicability of using remote sensing approach to quantitatively map the fsgd variations over a decade time span seasonal oscillation of fsgd over a long time period in tolo harbour hong kong is obtained specifically the fsgd is much higher at wet seasons and peaked in september the segment with high frequency of algal blooms and high e coli concentrations is generally consistent with a high fsgd in the past 20 years it is considered that the fsgd could favor algal blooms and increase e coli concentrations by delivering sufficient nutrient into the coastal waters based on a long term observation fsgd and nutrient concentration approached highest levels about 10 20 days prior to each algal bloom the results of this study shed lights on the fishery management water security and sustainability of coastal ecosystem in tolo harbor and elsewhere declaration of competing interest the authors

17933,solar driven interfacial water evaporation which gets rid of the limitation of saline waters enables to supply potable water in the worldwide especially in remote areas where only solar energy and water are available this technique has also exhibited great potential applications in fields such as seawater desalination steam sterilization and fuel production however the evaporation efficiency decreases during continuous operation in saline water due to the blockage of the solar absorber resulting from crystalline salt deposition therefore it is still a great challenge to design a stable and efficient solar driven interfacial saline water evaporator herein a variety of structural designs and engineering strategies for salt removal of evaporators in the latest years were reviewed we classified these strategies as remaining unsaturated evaporation of saline water preventing salt ions from contacting the solar absorber dissolving and or migrating back of crystalline salts and keeping salt crystallization away from evaporation area finally the current challenges and future research opportunities were discussed the purpose of this review was 1 to provide ideas to solve the problem of the reduced efficiency causing by salt deposition during saline water evaporation and 2 to promote the application of solar driven interfacial saline water evaporation technology by providing the latest achievements in structural designs for salt removal graphical abstract image 1 keywords photo thermal conversion interfacial saline water evaporation clean water production salt removal design concepts 1 introduction saline water utilization is an important way to solve the shortage of water availability for living in the worldwide and is also the critical complement and strategic reserve of water resources in coastal areas such being the importance for sustainable human development saline water desalination has become a long term development strategy in many countries although there are already dozens of desalination methods the recovery rate of clean water is still unsatisfactory even worse the emission of pollutants generated by burning fossil fuels has potential threats to the offshore ecosystem and marine environment zhang et al 2016 therefore scientists have made great efforts to produce potable water by adopting green technologies and proposed some novel desalination devices with high feasibility ali et al 2018 fang et al 2019 khan et al 2018 zhu et al 2019a among them solar driven water evaporation swe technology which combines the two most abundant resources on the earth i e solar energy and water was regarded as one of the most attractive and easy to implement desalination technologies tao et al 2018 however the solar absorber in the traditional evaporator is placed at the bottom of the bulk water there is a large spatial distance between the solar absorption and evaporation surfaces the evaporator suffers from low evaporation surface temperature associating with unsatisfied efficiency owing to the separated solar absorption and steam generation gives rise to considerable and inevitable heat loss from heat localization to evaporation surfaces raza et al 2018 tao et al 2018 wang et al 2016b in the past few years researchers have tried to manufacture novel solar materials and structures to directly absorb solar energy to produce portable water with faster evaporation rate as well as higher efficiency for this purpose solar driven nanoparticle suspension evaporation ni et al 2015 and solar driven interfacial water evaporation siwe ghasemi et al 2014 technologies have been successively developed the former transfers the photo thermal conversion process from the bottom to the volume of the bulk water resulting in a significantly improvement in water evaporation efficiency amjad et al 2017 jin et al 2016 wang et al 2017c however to fully tap into the potential of the volumetric heating effect of the nanofluid evaporator carbon based nanoparticles with strong light absorption capacity over the entire spectral wavelength of solar energy are usually adopted dao and choi 2018 liu et al 2018b tao et al 2018 wang et al 2016a zeiny et al 2018 this swe device is not only high in material cost but also limited by some critical problems such as agglomeration and sedimentation of nanoparticles low recyclability and secondary pollution of bulk water esfe et al 2019 kazemi et al 2020 li et al 2017a qi et al 2019 qi et al 2020 the siwe technology has achieved efficient heat localization on the evaporator surface thanks to the continuous development of new and low cost energy materials hu et al 2017 liu et al 2017b xu et al 2017 xue et al 2017a by selectively heating surface water and generating local high temperature it has successfully achieved water evaporation efficiency of more than 80 under one sun illumination gong et al 2019 ito et al 2015 zhang et al 2017a making it an ideal way to replace the traditional swe technology superior pure water evaporation efficiency has been achieved by improving the optical performancetogether with the structure of the water transport pathway of the solar absorber however the attention to evaporation performance of saline water such as seawater waste water and sewage is rather limited chen et al 2018 yang et al 2018b c yi et al 2017 resulting in a considerable gap between the current technical level and practical applications the primary challenge faced by the solar driven interfacial saline water evaporation sise system is the deposition of crystalline salts in the solar absorber including the crystallization of solvable salts exceeding saturation concentration and accumulation of a small amount of dissolvable salts song et al 2018b zhu et al 2019 the deposited salts in the solar absorber not only alter the transport channel of capillary water but also reduce the light capture ability of the evaporation surface and hence leading to the imbalance of water supply and demand as well as reducing the evaporation efficiency of saline water liu et al 2017c zhou et al 2016b therefore the salt accumulation in evaporators is a serious barrier to the development of efficient and stable sise devices herein we review the state of the art research and development in salt removal from the sise evaporators different solutions have been proposed by different groups but there has yet to be a unified review discussing the general strategies for this purpose the latest achievements on the design of efficient solar absorber materials and structures from principle to implementation were reviewed we classified these strategies as remaining unsaturated evaporation of saline water preventing salt ions from contacting the solar absorber dissolving and or migrating back of crystalline salts and keeping salt crystallization away from evaporation area moreover the challenges and perspectives for developing high performance sise devices were also discussed the purpose of this review is to provide the latest achievements on the design of efficient solar absorber materials and structures for solving the problem of low efficiency causing by salt deposition during saline water evaporation as well as for promoting the application of sise technology 2 synopsis of the early developments and applications sise is a neotype portable water production technique when siwe is well developed fig 1 shows the schematic diagram of sise under irradiation of sunlight the temperature of the solar absorber at the water air interface rises rapidly after absorbing solar energy transferring heat to the adsorbed water the local high temperature formed in the evaporator accelerates the evaporation of water producing potable clean water through condensation concurrently the solute concentration on the surface of the solar absorber increases under the combined action of advection and diffusion therefore salts crystallize on the surface of solar absorber due to the accumulation of solute concentration advection dominated exceeding the solubility limit during continuous evaporation in a typical sise device the solar absorber is the most important component which captures sunlight converts radiant energy to thermal energy and drives water evaporation from all kinds of source water at a thin thickness apart from the surface of solar absorber it can also provide channels for vapor transportation as shown in fig 1 starting from these ideas many effective methods to improve evaporation efficiency were found in the last several years e g chang et al 2016 chen et al 2019b huang et al 2017 huang et al 2018 li et al 2018a liu et al 2015a tian et al 2015 wang et al 2017b zhao et al 2015 specially ghasemi et al 2014 firstly concentrated the absorbed solar energy within the surface layer of bulk water through a floating membrane they uniformly deposited exfoliated graphene in foam carbon which is of floatability the porous structure of foam carbon has very good wettability enabling to quickly wicking bulk water to the evaporator surface through capillary action because this material has good absorption for sunlight it can maintain the low temperature of bulk water under antivacuum condition as a result the thermal efficiency reached 85 under 10 suns illumination ghasemi et al 2014 this is one of the groundbreaking configurations that set off revolution in the field of interfacial water evaporation some review articles on this topic may refer to chen et al 2019a deng et al 2017 elsheikh et al 2019 gao et al 2019a li et al 2019d liu et al 2017a raza et al 2018 tao et al 2018 wang et al 2019f wu et al 2019b zhang et al 2018b 2019a zhou et al 2019a and zhu et al 2019a it can be concluded from the above literatures that the material property and structure of solar absorber are the breakthrough points to ensure efficient photo thermal evaporation 2 1 solar absorber materials the material of solar absorber determines the ability of the evaporator to absorb solar energy chen et al 2018 wang et al 2020 which is the prerequisite for improving evaporation efficiency li et al 2018b gao et al 2019a xue et al 2017b commonly used solar absorber materials include metal nanoparticles with plasmon resonance effect and black carbon based materials with wide spectral absorption range bae et al 2015 realized polarization independent and ultra wide spectral absorption by using flexible black gold film and adiabatic plasma nano focusing method zhu s group successfully achieved the preparation of black plasmon absorber zhou et al 2016a solved optical loss problem of the solar absorber zhou et al 2016b and designed a three dimensional 3d hollow cone shaped solar absorber with reduced incident angle dependence li et al 2017b inspired by the perspiration process of human skin liu et al 2015b and wang et al 2014 assembled gold nanoparticle based membranes at the air water interface to produce a reusable and efficient evaporator on the other hand comparing graphene based solar absorbers with different structures fu et al 2017 ito et al 2015 zhang et al 2017a it is found that the solar absorber containing porous network architecture has stronger capillary action endowing the evaporator with a better water supply capacity as reported by zhang et al 2020a the interlayer distance of monolayer graphene can be sufficiently tuned via lighting control thus promoting the selective interaction between ions and nanosheets they offered a new insight for the design of novel graphene based nanostructures to realizes super water flux and high separation performance without sacrifice in salt ions rejection higgins et al 2018 and wilson et al 2019 made use of carbonized cotton and carbon fiber and gong et al 2019 employed carbon sponge to obtain evaporation efficiency of more than 80 under standard solar irradiance they have developed recyclable expandable and inexpensive high efficiency solar absorbers to mimic the transpiration of plants liu et al 2018a and zhu et al 2017 manufactured high performance evaporators making up of various kinds of wood taking advantages of their natural channels and good heat and mass transmission besides metal nanoparticles and carbon based materials inorganic semiconductors and polymeric materials have also attracted great interests from scholars worldwide the recent progress in each of these classes has been reviewed in detail by chen et al 2019a dao et al 2020 elsheikh et al 2019 gao et al 2019a li et al 2019d pang et al 2020 wu et al 2019b zhao et al 2020 etc herein we pay special attention to the mos2 based materials which were rarely mentioned but are also of great importance nano sized mos2 is considered as one of the most promising solar desalination materials owing to its excellent solar absorbing performance easy compound processing and earth abundant reserves serving as a two dimentional 2d transition metal dichalcogenide it has been widely used to collect solar energy for hydrogen production disinfection and power generation in addition the internal pores and defects endow the mos2 nanosheets with ion selectivity thiruraman et al 2018 therefore controlling the surface morphology and porosity of mos2 nanosheets may be helpful to build a high efficiency sise device according to the report of yang et al 2018a the mos2 nanosheets and single walled nanotube composite membrane with a thickness of only 120 nm exhibited a light absorbing capacity exceeding 82 in the whole solar spectrum range which accounted for its impressively high evaporation efficiency of 92 under 5 suns illumination more importantly the superior mechanical strength of the hybrid film enables to maintain stable water permeability and high salt resistance the chemical exfoliating mos2 is another efficient scalable and low toxicity solar absorbing material making it a promising candidate for sise ghim et al 2018 recently zhang et al 2020b fabricated 3d dimpled mos2 membranes dmms with open macroporous networks showing that the 2h dmm generates high heat localization compared to 1t dmm after multiple illumination and regeneration cycles 2h dmm presented high salt rejection performance what s more the mos2 based solar absorbers of guo et al 2018 2020 achieved evaporation efficiency exceeding 90 likewise a high evaporation efficiency of 96 2 at 2 5 suns illumination were achieved by employing a bilayer membrane wang et al 2020 in this design the top layer was formed via embedding nanoscale mos2 onto framework of porous polyurethane sponge while the bottom layer was originated from polyurethane sponge with the hydrophilic pda coating note that the potential application of mos2 as a solar absorber for sise has not been fully determined at least the solar evaporation rate should be increased to make mos2 based evaporators more competitive with other advanced configurations that already show evaporation rate beyond theoretical limit 2 2 structural engineering in addition to the applications of multifunctional materials evaporators with desirable structures have also been manufactured concurrently making the solar to water efficiency exceeding 90 li et al 2018c ma et al 2019 qiao et al 2019 wang et al 2019c wu et al 2019c zhu et al 2019b to minimize the light reflection and diffused heat loss wang et al 2018 designed a cone shaped 3d structure which has the absorbance over 99 and a photo thermal conversion efficiency up to 93 8 under 2 suns illumination zhao et al 2018 developed a hierarchically nanostructured gels hngs based on polyvinyl alcohol pva and polypyrrole ppy as shown in fig 2 a under solar illumination the ppy in the molecular grid of the generator was heated which was beneficial to the evaporation of confined water in the polymer network see 1 in fig 2b evaporation enthalpy of confined water in molecular grid decreased the evaporated water can be quickly recovered through branched water diffusion see 2 in fig 2b and pumping see 3 in fig 2b based on microchannels and internal gaps the evaporation rate reached 3 2 kg m 2 h 1 with good stability and durability under one sun illumination coincidentally the superabsorbent hydrogel with pva and chitosan as hydration framework and ppy as solar absorber further increased the evaporation rate up to 3 6 kg m 2 h 1 zhou et al 2019b shi et al 2018a fabricated a 3d cylindrical cup shaped structure of mixed metal oxides the 3d structure achieved a high energy efficiency of 100 under one sun illumination due to multiple reflections of incident light as well as the negligible heat loss within the absorber the diffuse reflection fig 2c and thermal radiation fig 2d test results of a 2d disk structure and a 3d cup structure showed that the cup wall can effectively recover diffuse reflection light and thermal radiation it is generally believed that solar radiation limits evaporation rate assuming that the energy transfer efficiency of the solar to steam is 100 however li et al 2018c proved that the evaporation rate could far exceeding this limit through careful structural design and direct energy collection from the environment they argued that if the temperature of the evaporator was lower than the ambient temperature energy could be obtained from the environment and the evaporation rate could be greatly increased far higher than the theoretical limit since evaporative cooling can reduce the temperature of the side surface to be lower than the ambient temperature by adopting a carefully designed steam generator the net energy gain of the environment was realized by reducing the energy loss of the top surface and maximizing the energy gain of the side surface under the condition of different incident light intensities note that the interest of transforming the absorber structure from a traditional planar device to a macroscopic 3d structure to obtain solar steam efficiency close to or even greater than the theoretical limit has never waned hong et al 2018 kim et al 2018a song et al 2018a zhang et al 2018a which provided a new approach to improve the performance of sise devices 2 3 applications of sise for energy production natural water evaporation is a promising source of renewable energy however the availability and reliability of this resource and its impact on water resources have yet to be explored for a long time cavusoglu et al 2017 evaluated the energy that can be collected during the natural evaporation process on the surface of natural waters finding that the power density generated by this process was three times that of modern wind power if effective measures were taken to combine water evaporation with electrical production the shortages of clean water and electricity in remote areas can be synchronously solved neumann et al 2016 zhu et al 2019a the novel technique of using the energy released by water evaporation to generate electricity has been widely concerned for example ma et al 2013 developed a polymer film actuator that exchanged water with the environment to cause expansion contraction of membrane by combining rigid matrix and dynamic polymerization network the generator assembled by the actuator and piezoelectric element could continuously output alternating current of 0 3 hz with a peak voltage of 1 0v chen et al 2015 reported an evaporation driven engine that relied on water to generate electricity and collect steam to drive the light source when the engine was placed at the air water interface gao et al 2016a designed a nano generator driven by water vapor under low speed airflow to realize self maintenance of temperature oscillation characteristics without the use of mechanical or electronic auxiliary devices ding et al 2017 and xue et al 2017b found that due to the interaction between water molecules and the solar absorber together with the hydrodynamic force provided by water evaporation in the solar absorber water evaporation could generate a continuous voltage of up to 1 v in the centimeter scale carbon based solar absorber confined channel note that the devices they designed could not collect clean water simultaneously resulting in a huge waste of energy in order to solve this problem zhu et al 2018a combined solar distillation and power generation using ultra light nitrogen rich carbon sponge to pump water achieving effective in situ photo thermal evaporation the generated steam could also induce electrical output demonstrating the synergistic photo thermal utilization capability of sise and cogeneration it should be noted that the sise technology not only showed potentials in power production but also can provide energy for photo catalysis devices gao et al 2016b shi et al 2018 shi et al 2020 water purification geng et al 2019 han et al 2019 qin et al 2019 qiu et al 2019 high temperature steam production chang et al 2019 wang et al 2019d steam sterilization loeb et al 2019 xu et al 2019 zhang et al 2017b crude oil recovery sun et al 2020 chemical fuel production zhu et al 2019a wearable electronic equipment li et al 2019b thermochemical batteries shen et al 2019 etc since these application scenarios beyond the scope of this review they will not be discussed in detail here 3 evaluations of sise performance 3 1 evaporation efficiency in a typical evaporation process the initial evaporation capacity gradually increased owing to more incident photons were collected and converted into thermal energy providing latent heat enthalpy for the phase change of water however after a specific transient and initial period the evaporation rate remained stable indicating that a thermal balance was reached between absorption evaporation and heat loss the evaporation efficiency was defined as the ratio of energy consumed by water gasification to incident light intensity ghasemi et al 2014 jiang et al 2016 ni et al 2016 1 η m h lv q 100 where m is the evaporation rate of water under steady state conditions q is the power density at the surface of the evaporator and h lv is the sum of enthalpy for liquid vapor phase change including sensible and latent heat enthalpy 2 h lv λ lv c p δ t where λ lv c p and δt are latent heat of vaporization specific heat capacity and temperature rise of water respectively it should be noted that due to the lack of standardized measurement techniques and unified evaluation methods for the evaporation efficiency it is still difficult and unreliable to directly compare the reported performance of different sise devices chen et al 2019a li et al 2019c 3 2 heat losses the heat consumption at the steady state conditions can be subdivided into six categories hu et al 2017 li et al 2016 2018a xu et al 2017 yang et al 2018a i e 1 phase change enthalpy for steam generation 2 convection 3 radiation and 4 reflection losses from the top surface of evaporator to the surroundings 5 conduction loss to bulk water through the solar absorber and 6 convection loss to the surroundings from the lateral and bottom surfaces as schematically shown in fig 1 the ratio of solar energy to latent heat enthalpy and the consumption of steam generation were equal to the evaporation efficiency at steady state conditions caused by illumination only convection loss was calculated by newton s law of cooling 3 q conv h a ts t ts t f where h is the convective heat transfer coefficient of air in natural convection a ts is the top surface area while t ts and t f are the temperatures of the top surface and the ambient respectively radiation loss was calculated using the stefan boltzmann law 4 q rad ε a ts σ t ts 4 t f 4 where ε is the emissivity of the solar absorber and σ is the stefan boltzmann constant the reflection loss was equal to the reflectance of the solar absorber which was often measured using a high precision ultraviolet visible near infrared spectrophotometer the conduction loss to bulk water was calculated based on the temperature gradient of the bulk water and the fourier s law 5 q cond k a ts δ t δ where k is the thermal conductivity of the water and δ t δ is the temperature gradient for permeating the bulk water the convection heat loss from the lateral and bottom surfaces to the surroundings should be the difference between the incident energy and the total amount for the above five categories of energy consumptions 3 3 physical parameters eq 1 shows that the evaporation efficiency of sise device is related to evaporation rate phase change enthalpy and incident power density according to eq 2 the phase change enthalpy is a function of the latent heat of vaporization specific heat capacity together with temperature rise of water herein the measurement methods of these physical parameters in sise field are summarized evaporation rate the evaporation rate was defined as the productivity of solar drive steam per unit time and area at the steady state conditions compared with evaporation efficiency it can evaluate the performance of evaporator more accurate and comparable in a typical experiment a precision electronic balance was generally adopted to monitor the mass loss of bulk water i e evaporation capacity during evaporation the curve of mass loss per unit area as a function of time changed almost linearly after a certain period of illumination and the slope of this straight line was regarded as the evaporation rate phase change enthalpy the phase change enthalpy was the sum of sensible and latent enthalpy the latent enthalpy and specific heat capacity were usually taken from the physical properties of water at a given temperature and pressure ghasemi et al 2014 li et al 2018a however this oversimplified approach is not suitable to determine parameters of water in molecular meshes which have a reduced vaporization enthalpy therefore differential scanning calorimetric dsc measurements were conducted to determine the vaporization energy of water and water in the solar absorber the specific heat capacity was calculated by comparing the heat flow of measured solar absorber with that of the standard sample zhao et al 2018 zhou et al 2019b additionally temperature measurement was applied to not only analyze the thermal characteristics and energy transmission during evaporation but also to evaluate the potential applications of steam zhou et al 2019a in sise system the thermocouple and infrared thermal imaging techniques were generally employed to measure temperatures of the vapor bulk water and solar absorber compared with the thermocouple method the non invasive thermal imaging technique was used more widely might be its advantages in interference free high spatio temporal resolution and visualization of temperature distribution li et al 2019 power density whether the power density of the incident light is effectively measured is one of the decisive factors for the accurate evaluation of evaporation performance for this purpose optical power meter and standard solar cell were usually employed to calibrate the power density the optical power meter adopts thermopile technique which has wider spectral response range and thus has a higher accuracy the standard solar cell i e silicon cell however has narrower spectral response wavelength if the light irradiates the solar cell for a long time the physical accumulation of excess energy which cannot activate the electrons causes the temperature rise of cell li et al 2019a resulting in the measured value being smaller than the actual power density 4 greatest challenge crystalline salt deposition to improve evaporation capacity concentrators have to be used to improve solar irradiance this is because solar thermal distillation depends on the saturated vapor pressure of water which has an exponential relationship with temperature so that the output of purified water is exponentially related to light intensity dongare et al 2019 although significant progress has been made in material and structural developments as described in section 2 the deposition of salts during continuous operation hinders the maintenance and or enhancement of sise performance therefore the sise technology is still not ready for practical application especially because it lacks long term stability 4 1 mechanism of crystalline salt deposition sise is affected by many factors such as the water supply capacity of the solar absorber composition of the saline water interfacial performance and environmental conditions tao et al 2018 zhong et al 2019 essentially the advection diffusion transport of salt ions together with the evaporation efficiency of saline water determines the salt concentration on the evaporator surface as shown in fig 1 under solar illumination saline water containing salt ions is transported to the evaporation surface through advection to compensate for the evaporated water as a result both the ion concentration of the evaporation surface and the salinity gradient between the evaporation surface and the bulk water are increased on the other hand once the concentration gradient is formed the diffusive force drives salt ions to migrate from the surface of solar absorber to bulk water derluyn et al 2019 toksoz and yilmaz 2020 reducing the salt concentration on the evaporation surface therefore the nucleation position of salt crystals depends on the dynamic balance between advection of salt ions on the surface of the solar absorber and spontaneous diffusion of salts from high to low concentration areas note that when the concentration of salt increases continuously resulting in crystallization of salts on the active evaporation surface of solar absorbers reducing the evaporation efficiency caused by the increasing in reflection even worse the crystallized salts block the water supply pathway finnerty et al 2017 ren et al 2017 yang et al 2018a at night the formed salts gradually dissolve back and or diffuse into brine water which is contained in the microchannels of the solar absorber xu et al 2019b if the diameter of the micro channel in the solar absorber is large water can be quickly transported during relatively long operation in contrast if the solar absorber is mainly composed of nanochannels the channels will be blocked after several hours of operation zhu et al 2018b ito et al 2015 have reported that the micrometer sized pore channels are more appropriate for capillary action of water compared to the nanochannels this is because the nanosized pore channels may increase viscous resistance of water inhibiting the transportation of water to evaporative area note that this viewpoint has been generally accepted for example zhang et al 2020a revealed the effective access and diffusion of various ions and molecules in microchannels based on this mechanism in addition for solar absorber with microchannels the water fills the pores by capillary forces theoretically for a capillary channel a smaller pore size leads to a higher capillary pressure as a consequence there is a continuous progression from multi layer adsorption to capillary condensation in which the smaller pores may be more likely to be filled with water on the other hand although capillary fore can provide high water flux there is an inherent trade off between capillary pressure and flow resistance the former is inversely proportional while the latter is positively correlated to pore diameter therefore the capillary force is inversely proportional to flow resistance this trade off is more prominent in sise device because the thickness of the capillary force layer must be thick enough to minimize conductive heat loss at this point a thick insulation layer was generally used to separate the solar absorber and saline water ni et al 2018 resulting in the evaporation rate being far lower than the theoretically achievable zeng et al 2019 4 2 destructiveness of deposited salts the vapor transport is related to the pressure difference between the saturated vapor near the evaporation surface and the far field vapor there are two general mechanisms of solute concentration affecting water evaporation in porous media a to reduce vapor pressure by increasing solution osmotic pressure and b to reduce the vapor diffusion coefficient due to mechanical blockage of water pathways by crystalline salts mendez et al 2018 jambhekar et al 2015 therefore it can be inferred that the continuous salt accumulation will suppress vapor transportation deposition of salt crystals is directly manifested as the evaporation efficiency in saline water is much lower than that in clean water although the solar absorbers can absorb all incident solar energy wang et al 2017a 2017d zhang et al 2018c zhu et al 2018b for example kou et al 2019 developed low cost recyclable cotton carbon nanotube fabrics based on a simple dyeing process these cotton fabrics had good hydrophilicity flexibility and high absorbance 95 7 the evaporator except for the surface of polystyrene foam was insulated with cotton carbon nanotube fabric this configuration showed a seawater evaporation rate up to 1 59 kg m 2 h 1 when operating in saline water nacl 17 5 however solid salts were observed on the cotton fabric surface after running for 8 h more than 85 of the evaporation surface was covered resulting in the evaporation rate dropping to 0 54 kg m 2 h 1 a bench scale setup was built to evaluate the steam generation performance of the synthetic graphene oxide go leaf finnerty et al 2017 as shown in fig 3 a the configuration generated steam at a rate of 2 kg m 2 h 1 with an energy efficiency of 78 for fresh water however in highly concentrated saline water with concentrations of 7 and 15 the evaporator was covered by thick salt crust sheltering from the sunlight for several hours resulting in serious reduction in evaporation rate 0 71 and 0 5 kg m 2 h 1 respectively even vertically arranged carbon nanotube array that was close to black body absorption was employed as the solar absorber the evaporation efficiency in seawater was only 30 yin et al 2017 likewise a careful design of plasmonic wood coupling both the plasmonic effect of metal nanoparticles and the waveguide effect of microchannels in the wood matrix has been successfully realized zhu et al 2018b as shown in fig 3b the composite materialabsorbed 99 of the incident sunlight which achieved a solar energy conversion efficiency of 85 without recession after continuous operation at 10 suns illumination over 6 days the adversity showing the evaporation efficiency under one sun illumination was only 69 although salt formation on the surface of the plasmonic wood was not obvious by integrating a paper based reduced go composite prgo film on a silicon based porous insulation layer hydrophilic prgo membranes laterally pumped water from the periphery to the central evaporation area instead of vertically supplying water wang et al 2017d as shown in fig 3c this novel evaporation structure design fully eliminated the downward conduction heat loss from the evaporator to the bulk water although steady state evaporation efficiency of the sise system reached up to 89 7 when placing the evaporator on nacl solution with a concentration of only 3 5 the evaporation efficiency dropped to 76 recently hu et al proposed a janus evaporator with a low tortuous pore structure based on a sio2 cellulose nanofiber carbon nanotube hybrid network solar absorber hu et al 2019 the salt accumulation caused by water evaporation was limited to the hydrophobic hydrophilic interface and can be rapidly excreted through channels with low curvature fig 3d this structure offered evaporation rates of 1 25 kg m 2 h 1 in pure water and 1 09 kg m 2 h 1 in nacl solution with a concentration of 3 5 nonetheless the evaporator continuously desalinated for 100 h at one sun illumination with an evaporation efficiency exceeding 80 in addition the specially manufactured conical biomimetic 3d structure of wu et al 2020 showed an evaporation rate of 2 24 kg m 2 h 1 when operating at a nacl concentration of 25 which may be the highest record so far but still 15 lower than that at pure water 2 63 kg m 2 h 1 it should be noted that since only one kind of salt nacl was added to the simulated saline water this efficiency is bound to be further reduced in the real saline water abney et al 2017 kim et al 2018b loganathan et al 2017 which is a complex mixture of solid and liquid particles of organic and inorganic substances as mentioned above for most sise devices in the past salts may block the pathways for water supply and steam escape during evaporation and even further accumulated on the surface receiving light the salt covered surface would sacrifice the light collection capacity and prevent water pumping and steam transmission eventually deteriorating the evaporation performance and limiting the long term operation of the equipment in addition saline water conditions usually corroded the structure of the membrane morelos gomez et al 2017 which was rarely studied therefore it is necessary to pay attention to the stability and durability of the absorber for purpose of adopting these solar evaporation structures to generate steam competitively 5 advanced design concepts of salt removal conventional methods for addressing salt plugging problems include backwashing and physical removal however these approaches will interrupt continuous production resulting in increased operation cost and decreased productivity new photo thermal materials with antifouling performance and solar desalination systems with salt tolerance are urgently needed but have been challenging material structures for efficient economical and large scale desalination of saturated saline water should to exhibit the following characteristics simultaneously strong absorption of incident light buoyancy of the liquid vapor surface low thermal conductivity for heat localization at the liquid vapor interface anti clogging characteristics to prevent salt accumulation on the surface durability and flexibility for easy implementation and long lifetime guo et al 2019 liu et al 2019a in addition a complete salt removal sise devices should be planned with double functions 1 maintain a low ionic concentration in the heat localization area in which crystalline salts cannot be generated 2 timely transport the formed crystal substances to prevent salts accumulation in the solar absorber the former can be achieved by providing sufficient water supply and or preventing the accumulation of saline ions in solar absorber in the latter case salts have already formed so the deposited salts must be dissolved migrated back or collected basing on these concerns in this review the recent strategies for salt elimination from the sise devices are subdivided into remaining unsaturated evaporation of saline water preventing salt ions from contacting the solar absorber dissolving and or migrating back of crystalline salts and keeping salt crystallization away from evaporation area as schematically shown in fig 4 evaporation rate of sise devices based on different design concepts from the selected typical publications are listed in table 1 the up to date researches and developments in the above aspects will be summarized and discussed in detail in this section note that the now available evaporator designs often contain more than one of the above strategies to prevent salt accumulation as possible and we considered only the closest one for their classification 5 1 maintain a low ionic concentration in the heat localization area 5 1 1 remain unsaturated evaporation of saline water the crystallization in sise process belongs to evaporative crystallization which occurs only at the conditions of appropriate molar concentration of substances temperature and static evaporator therefore by comprehensively controlling these crystallization conditions unsaturated evaporation of saline water can be realized and salt precipitation can be prevented effectively note that the efficient sise devices should also have high solar energy absorption fast water transportation efficient solar steam evaporation and good thermal insulation song et al 2018b proposed a hierarchical silicon copper membrane composed of nanoscale hybrid materials with effective salt tolerance inspired by natural lotus leaves as shown in fig 5 a after the salt induced wetting property was changed the porous membrane showed a super hydrophobic light receiving surface and a super hydrophilic root like surface it is noteworthy that the porous membranes exhibited large contact surfaces omnidirectional light decay pathways effective salt removal capability and abundant hierarchical water supply and steam generation channels resulting in efficient and long term stable desalination performance without the accumulation of salts in saline water compared with other evaporators finnerty et al 2017 hu et al 2019 kou et al 2019 ren et al 2017 wang et al 2017a 2017d yin et al 2017 zhang et al 2018c zhu et al 2018b it is surprising that the evaporation efficiency was increased from 50 2 to 55 1 after 120 days of normal saline circulation fig 5b more interestingly even after 310 days of ultra long durability test in saline water the formation of a salt induced robust super hydrophilic interface layer on the pumping structure endowed the evaporator with a 7 8 improvement in evaporation efficiency fig 5b further research showed that the hierarchical structure served as an ion selective membrane to allow na to pass through while inhibiting cl from being destroyed during operation it should be noted that due to the limitation of the permeability of ion selective membrane crystalline salt deposition may also occur when operating on high salinity waters in this case the space between capillary surfaces may be shorten leading to significant increase of viscous resistance and also inhibiting saline water transportation liu et al 2019b synthesized black gold nanoparticles in situ on a magneto rheometer and formed sponges containing nanoparticles by in situ reduction at room temperature the melamine resin sponge pillars pumped the solution from the bottom to the top providing the water supply when the evaporation surface was separated from the bulk saline water which reduced heat transfer to bulk water during evaporation on the other hand the concentrated solution in both the sponge and dilute bulk solution could be moved and exchanged through the melamine resin sponge pillars to support self driven salt tolerance fig 5c the evaporation rate and efficiency were not significantly reduced and no solid salt was deposited after evaporation for 1 h even if the concentration was as high as 20 in addition after 11 h of evaporation the solar absorptivity decreased by less than 0 1 surprisingly the evaporation efficiency exceeded 90 in high salinity water this structure fundamentally avoided the formation of solid salts by using the self driving salt tolerance mechanism because this mechanism worked through the properties of solution and material it provided a general strategy for designing solar evaporators without salt deposition defects apart from the evaporation efficiency the cost of the evaporator cannot be ignored the use of low cost materials and manufacturing methods together with facile device regeneration to avoid salt accumulation are crucial to the development of sise technology trees are one of the richest raw materials on earth and play an important role in the ecosystem because the interface between carbonized wood and natural wood segments has perfect microstructure matching it is conducive to effective water supply andsalts removal a high efficiency solar steam device entirely made of natural wood was reported by zhu et al 2017 the original natural wood was cut along the transverse direction and the top surface was carbonized to form a unique double layer structure because the relatively slow evaporation rate hindered the ability of salt to reach its crystallization concentration at a low light intensity no salt was deposited under one sun illumination note that salt deposition was only apparent when the solar intensity was 5 suns but did not significantly reduce the steam generation performance similarly huang et al 2019 designed a ppy wood structure by in situ polymerization of pyrrole monomers into a 3d porous wood matrix salt accumulation was not obvious under one sun illumination when the nacl concentration was 3 5 however with the increase of salinity by 10 20 and saturation the ppy wood evaporator failed to maintain the balance with the original pore structure facing faster salt accumulation larger channels and higher hydraulic conductivity were required to maintain the function of salt discharge channels he et al 2019 proved that bimodal porous structure based on carbonized wood can be used as an efficient and stable solar steam generator for desalting high salt brine in the process of solar desalination the salinity of saline water in narrow tubules increased due to the rapid evaporation of water although the tracheid was too narrow to be fully replenished with saline water the high concentration saline water gradually diffused to the peripheral vascular channels through pits nano pores and ray parenchyma cells the nearby vessel passages helped to avoid salt crystals from forming on the evaporator surface because they increased the ability to exchange salt with bulk saline water fig 5d moreover many ray cells that periodically penetrated the micro channels contributed to the lateral transportation of saline water through diffusion or advection these inherent microstructures could effectively avoid the accumulation of salts during a long term solar steam generation process as a result no accumulation of any salt on the surface of the bimodal evaporator was observed after continuous operation for 7 h at 6 suns in the control experiment severe salt accumulation was observed on the surface of the polydimethylsiloxane wood structure when the large vessel passage of wood was blocked by polydimethylsiloxane and the tracheid was completely opened for saline water transportation which confirmed the importance of bimodal porous microstructure for long term efficient and anti accumulation solar desalination overall the tree inspired design provided a cheap and scalable solar energy collection and steam generation technology that can provide clean water in worldwide especially in rural or remote areas where water is not only scarce but also limited by water extraction materials and equipment chen et al 2018 liu et al 2018a wang et al 2017d 2019b e 5 1 2 prevent salt ions from contacting the solar absorber physically the phenomenon of salt crystallization will not occur if the free salt ions are limited outside the heat localization area or the ion concentration in this area is unsaturated this idea has been realized by floating a bilayer structure with hydrophobic upper layer and hydrophilic lower layer such as janus membrane on the surface of saline water natural moisture free hydrophobic surface is an effective way to prevent saline water infiltration however since most of the water is blocked the evaporation rate of the fully hydrophobic structure is significantly lower than that of the hydrophilic structure yang et al 2018b designed a hydrophilic hydrophobic bilayer nanopores structure which was consists of a hydrophobic salt tolerant hierarchical structure layer composed of a well defined array of cu2snse3 or cu2znse4 nano layers and a hydrophilic filtering membrane for continuous water supply and steam generation xu et al 2018 reported a flexible janus thin film evaporator with a polymethyl methacrylate pmma layer coated with hydrophobic carbon black cb on the top surface and a hydrophilic polyacrylonitrile pan layer on the bottom as shown in fig 6 a in this design salt can only deposit at the bottom of the hydrophilic layer and directly contacted and dissolved in the hydrophilic layer with bulk water owing to the insulation effect of hydrophobic pmma layer it was certain that janus structure avoided salt crystallization on the surface of the solar absorber and made solar desalination rather stable likewise gao et al 2019b manufactured a self floating janus solar absorber fig 6b which enabled to realize the sustainable collection of clean water by evaporation in this configuration candle soot was selectively deposited on one side of the cotton fabric while avoiding deposition on the opposite side the hierarchically porous structure on the coating side as well as the difference in wetting properties between the two sides endowed the possibility for water and steam to be well transported through the janus membrane under solar irradiation cooper et al 2018 adopted a solar absorber to transfer the non contact radiation to water and employed low intensity solar flux to generate steam in the non contact structure water worked as its own heat absorber making the equipment very strong vibrational absorption and free from pollution this device ran well for producing potable water from polluted and high salinity saline water without the risk of pollution or blockage similar design strategies can also be referred to the reports by zeng et al 2019 and zhang et al 2019 the above mentioned devices can be simply manufactured and operated well in saline water which provided reliable strategies for efficient saline water desalination special equipment and elaborate fabrication were not required for the manufacture of these evaporators they were expected to be the portable sise devices for the janus membranes however the structures need to be thin to avoid crystallizing at the hydrophilic hydrophobic interface resulting in insufficient heat localization and large conductive heat loss this is mainly because the thermal insulation layer separated the evaporation interface from the cold saline water below which salt removal was required inadequate repulsion led to structural blockage and eventually deteriorated the optical and core arranging performance of the structure in addition the assembled steam collection system restrained the steam flow conditions from those of open evaporation inhibiting evaporation and water collection rates moreover the stacking property of janus membrane limited the interlayer spacing to nanoscale hindering water diffusion from bulk water to the surface thus reducing evaporation rate zhang et al 2019 taken these shortcomings into consideration ni et al 2018 reported a salt resistant solar distiller by using a multilayer solar evaporator structure which was composed of a black cellulose fabric for solar absorption a composite white fabric wick and polystyrene foam insulation fig 6c f the white fabric was porous and hydrophilic allowing it to wick water to the upper solar evaporation structure while diffusing the concentrated salt back into the bulk water fig 6d the evaporation structure fig 6e was designed to collect the generated steam with the help of a condensation cover fig 6f therefore the evaporator showed long term stability when operating on nacl solution with a concentration of 3 5 and no salt deposition was found after continuous operation for 30 h under one sun illumination moreover the evaporation structure was placed on nacl simulated saline water while 40 g of solid nacl was directly added to the evaporation surface which was sufficient to saturate the entire wick structure incredibly the salts were completely dissolved within 1 h and steam was subsequently generated although a large amount of salt was placed on the top surface their research indicated that the evaporation structure not only can inhibit the formation of nacl in the process of solar evaporation for several consecutive days but also enabled to dissolve and inhibit salt deposition even under constant light conditions 5 2 prevent salts accumulation in the solar absorber 5 2 1 dissolve and or migrate back crystalline salts when neither of the above methods can completely eliminate the migration of anion cation withwater to the evaporation surface salt crystallization will inevitably occur during evaporation in this case the evaporators which are capable of rapidly dissolving crystalline salt and or supporting salt crystals falling back to the bulk water can be employed it has been reported that the seamless connection between nitrogen doped hydrophilic graphene nanoparticles n fgps and hydrophobic self assembled graphene foam associating with the self cleaning property of n fgp structure by redissolving the captured salt in the water channel can realize long term stable and continuous operation in real seawater for more than 240 h without degradation in evaporation efficiency wu et al 2019a recently wang et al 2019a designed an evaporator based on a blank hollow spacer fabric bhsf filled with chitosan and coated with rgo on its surface due to the unique hollow structure of bhsf the aligned large channel array 2 mm provided additional low bending pathways which in turn resulted in faster salt exchange between the aligned channel array and the bulk solution it promoted the concentrated solution to be transferred back to the bulk solution through the solar absorber therefore almost no solid salt existed on the surface of evaporator after operating for 60 min at one sun irradiation zhang et al 2019b proposed a self desalting solar evaporation system which was composed of rgo cotton fabric on vertically oriented porous polyacrylonitrile foam voppf as shown in fig 7 a results proved that there was no salt accumulation when desalting on simulated saline water 3 5 nacl for 12 h it was the hydrophilicity of cotton fabric the floatability of voppf on water and continuous pumping of water that promoted the re dissolution of salts and hindered its accumulation on the photo thermal layer during evaporation in the device designed by mohammadásajadi and hiáwang 2017 the material structure had a porous polymer skeleton with embedded graphite sheets and carbon fibers the geometry of the pores in this structure and the anti clogging coating prevented the accumulation of any salt importantly the poly 3 4 ethylenedioxythiophene poly styrenesulfonate on the surface of the evaporator had the characteristics of antifouling and preventing salts from adhering to the surface under the irradiation of one sun for more than 20 h the pores in this structure were still completely open as mentioned in section 5 1 the natural water circulation system simulating photosynthesis and transpiration of trees enabled to effectively improve the salt removal capacity of sise system which was considered as a promising strategy to solve the problem of global water shortage however there are still challenges in terms of relatively low delivery rate short delivery distance and unsatisfactory extraction efficiency therefore it is also an important direction pursued by researchers to develop sise system with high efficiency demineralization capability by adopting the biomimetic evaporators kuang et al 2019 designed a self excited solar evaporator with good antifouling performance by using a reasonably designed artificial channel array on a natural wood substrate as shown in fig 7b under the action of solar evaporation due to different hydraulic conductivity a salt concentration gradient was formed between millimeter level drilling channels with lower salt concentration and fine natural wood channels with higher salt concentration the concentration gradient allowed salt exchange between natural rivers to pass through the pits resulting in a miniaturized wooden channel for salt dilution the drilled channel with high hydraulic conductivity has the function of salt discharge which could quickly exchange salt with bulk solution and achieved real time self regeneration of evaporator this is because the movement of crystalline salts to bulk saline water is a spontaneous process driven by the chemical potential difference of different salt concentrations the dynamic factors of salt diffusion in the evaporator were also determined by the intrinsic properties of the membrane structure according to fick s law if the self cleaning process of salt pollution was considered as the diffusion of ions in porous media the structure of the automatic cleaning material must have high porosity and interconnected porosity to increase the diffusion coefficient of salt ions and migrate back to bulk water recently a water lily inspired hierarchical structure consists of a top solar absorber and a bottom bracket was designed by xu et al 2019a as shown in fig 7c and d unlike the previous studies water could not enter the absorber but formed a thin layer of water film between the top hydrophobic absorber and the bottom supporter fig 7e the absorbed solar energy was concentrated in this thin layer of water for evaporation when water evaporated salt solute drained down along the one dimensional channel with water solar evaporation was stable even when high concentration saline water was treated because the thin layer water used for solar evaporation was formed under the absorber instead of inside it fig 7e 5 2 2 keep salt crystallization away from evaporation area the solar evaporators reported in the references of ni et al 2018 and xu et al 2018 floated directly on saline water with a salt concentration of 3 5 and salts can be dissolved back into the bulk water without the problem of salt accumulation however this was equivalent to directly discharging salt back to the bulk saline water which still had environmental impact problems moreover high concentration of salt diffused back into the stock solution instead of being collected wasting the opportunity to obtain valuable mineral resources therefore proper management of salt crystallization during solar evaporation is an active demand for continuous steam production and simultaneous salt harvesting to address this issue shi et al 2018b developed a 3d cup shaped solar evaporator and zero liquid discharge high efficiency desalination was realized through solar distillation fig 8 a by reasonably separating the light absorption surface from the salting out surface the light absorption of the 3d solar evaporator was no longer affected by the salt shell layer like the traditional 2d solar evaporator fig 8b after 24 h exposure under one sun illumination an interesting observation was that although the growth and precipitation of salt crystals were very significant in all cases the inner cup wall was always clean without any salt coverage fig 8c moreover it can be operated at a very high salt concentration of 25 without significant water evaporation rate decay persisting 120 h this new design concept of solar energy evaporator provided a promising technology especially for the treatment of high salinity water to realize green zero liquid discharge seawater desalination and high salinity industrial wastewater treatment in seawater desalination plants additionally this design can realize the effective collection of crystalline salts during sise process if this is required it should be noted that if the purpose of the device is to produce salts rather than clean water salt blocking may be beneficial pramanik et al 2016 salmón et al 2018 recently the stable and continuous saline water evaporation was successfully realized through spatially isolating salt crystals from the saline water evaporation surface with the help of self harvesting feature of the salts xia et al 2019 as shown in fig 8d and e saline water was first delivered from the bulk solution to the center of the evaporator by cotton thread subsequently the saline water was transported from the center to the edge through filter paper due to its super hydrophilicity and well developed capillary channels in the process of solution transportation the local heating of solar absorber caused the water to evaporate continuously therefore concentration of nacl gradually increased when the saline water approaching the edge resulting in salt crystallization at the edge of the evaporator fig 8f it was easy to harvest the remaining salt crystallizes at the edge of the evaporator owing to that they would fall off under the action of gravity for the first time the authors achieved continuous steam production and solid salts harvesting without additional treatment the sise configuration designed by xu et al 2020 based on the identical principles showed a solar water conversion efficiency of over 40 together with a higher production efficiency of nacl than that of traditional salt farm technology when producing potable water from brine 10 w w wu et al 2020 printed a conical biomimetic 3d evaporator that achieved gradient distribution of interfacial water film through hierarchical water pathways the surface of the device exhibited position dependent water thickness and temperature gradient along the sidewall leading to the thermocapillary force inside the liquid film and the capability to capture energy from the surroundings when the evaporator was continuous operated in nacl solution with a concentration up to 25 salts would crystallize on apex of the evaporator as shown in fig 8g it should be noted that the evaporation rate did not decrease significantly 15 this is because that there was a layer of liquid film between the crystallized salt and the evaporator together with the existence of channels inside the crystalline salts fig 8h a configuration composed of a batch of biomimetic 3d evaporators was continuously exposed to sunlight in a closed system for 10 days with 9 h every day to test its durability as shown in fig 8i the stability and reproducibility of the specially manufactured evaporator was verified moreover the accumulated salts at the vertex of the evaporator can be easily removed and collected 6 conclusions and outlook as an emerging technology sise only uses the abundant solar energy and saline water to produce potable water which is one of the most important technologies to solve the problem of global water shortage however the deposition of crystalline salts during operation will inevitably reduce evaporation efficiency and even lead to shutdown of the equipment this paper comprehensively sorted out the latest researches and developments in salt removal from the sise devices the crystalline salts can be effectively avoided or reduced by remaining unsaturated evaporation of saline water preventing salt ions from contacting the solar absorber dissolving and or migrating back of crystalline salts and keeping salt crystallization away from evaporation area note that the lack of experimental experience in operating sise devices in complex environments and the unclear microscopic mechanisms affecting the water and or vapor transport in evaporators have resulted in a big gap between the current technical level and actual applications the following issues for suggestions would provide reference for the further development of this technology 1 salt blockage is the critical problem in the long term sise process especially for high salinity water sources a device that can address this issue is crucial to the development of sise technology and significant progress has been made this problem may be satisfactorily addressed by simultaneously employing low cost materials and inexpensive manufacturing methods using simple device regeneration to avoid salt accumulation and structural integrity of saline water extraction devices moreover surface wettability and pore structure modification have been proved to be effective to reduce clogging but also reduce evaporation efficiency therefore salt blockage is still a fundamental challenge inherent in all solar absorbers in direct contact with the saline water surface that need to be further studied 2 the real saline water conditions have the convection cooling effect of waves and currents which is rarely studied in the literatures in most previous solar evaporation experiments static water was added to the beaker thus adding extra heat insulation an extensible sise device not only has excellent salt resistance ability but also has the characteristics of strong spectral absorptivity low reflectivity self floating low thermal conductivity porosity and adaptability in complex environments it is still challenging to integrate these characteristics into an evaporator therefore it is necessary to find out the basic properties of evaporator and the influence of external meteorological environment on evaporation performance in addition attentions should also be payed to the critical thermophysical properties during saline water evaporation to comprehensively analyze the interaction between hydrodynamics and heat and mass transfer within and nearby the evaporators 3 the wettability is a critical characteristic affecting saline water evaporation which determines the transmission capability of capillary water in the solar absorber the absorption of incident light and the floatability of the device in the past the design principle was to improve the wettability of the solar absorber as possible by increasing the capillary water transport capacity of the solar absorber ignoring the heat loss caused by excessive wetting of the evaporation surface it is suggested that the problems of excessive and insufficient wetting of the evaporation surface of the solar absorber should be synergistically considered a subtle balance between the water supply and evaporation rates during saline water evaporation might be realized by adjusting the geometric structure of the solar absorber in combination with the experimental study of sise and the numerical simulation of heat and mass transfer of the solar absorber 4 the deposition of crystalline salts on the surface of solar absorbers is not only a great challenge for the development of sise technique but also a common scientific problem in multidisciplinary fields such as energy geology and hydrology understanding the physical process and mechanisms of salt evolution on the surface of solar absorber during sise are solid foundations for solving the problem of crystalline salt deposition recent researches have shown that the solute transport characteristics and interfacial evaporation behaviors are the key mechanisms affecting the morphologic evolution of crystalline salts due to the small temporal and spatial scales of sise evolution process the experimental study of solute transport mechanism is very complicated and thus the quantitative analysis of pore scale solute continuity dynamics involved in this physical process was rarely reported therefore it is necessary to deeply study the physical processes and mechanisms of morphologic evolution of crystalline salts on the surface of solar absorber basing on the advection diffusion theory and evaporation behaviors declaration of competing

17933,solar driven interfacial water evaporation which gets rid of the limitation of saline waters enables to supply potable water in the worldwide especially in remote areas where only solar energy and water are available this technique has also exhibited great potential applications in fields such as seawater desalination steam sterilization and fuel production however the evaporation efficiency decreases during continuous operation in saline water due to the blockage of the solar absorber resulting from crystalline salt deposition therefore it is still a great challenge to design a stable and efficient solar driven interfacial saline water evaporator herein a variety of structural designs and engineering strategies for salt removal of evaporators in the latest years were reviewed we classified these strategies as remaining unsaturated evaporation of saline water preventing salt ions from contacting the solar absorber dissolving and or migrating back of crystalline salts and keeping salt crystallization away from evaporation area finally the current challenges and future research opportunities were discussed the purpose of this review was 1 to provide ideas to solve the problem of the reduced efficiency causing by salt deposition during saline water evaporation and 2 to promote the application of solar driven interfacial saline water evaporation technology by providing the latest achievements in structural designs for salt removal graphical abstract image 1 keywords photo thermal conversion interfacial saline water evaporation clean water production salt removal design concepts 1 introduction saline water utilization is an important way to solve the shortage of water availability for living in the worldwide and is also the critical complement and strategic reserve of water resources in coastal areas such being the importance for sustainable human development saline water desalination has become a long term development strategy in many countries although there are already dozens of desalination methods the recovery rate of clean water is still unsatisfactory even worse the emission of pollutants generated by burning fossil fuels has potential threats to the offshore ecosystem and marine environment zhang et al 2016 therefore scientists have made great efforts to produce potable water by adopting green technologies and proposed some novel desalination devices with high feasibility ali et al 2018 fang et al 2019 khan et al 2018 zhu et al 2019a among them solar driven water evaporation swe technology which combines the two most abundant resources on the earth i e solar energy and water was regarded as one of the most attractive and easy to implement desalination technologies tao et al 2018 however the solar absorber in the traditional evaporator is placed at the bottom of the bulk water there is a large spatial distance between the solar absorption and evaporation surfaces the evaporator suffers from low evaporation surface temperature associating with unsatisfied efficiency owing to the separated solar absorption and steam generation gives rise to considerable and inevitable heat loss from heat localization to evaporation surfaces raza et al 2018 tao et al 2018 wang et al 2016b in the past few years researchers have tried to manufacture novel solar materials and structures to directly absorb solar energy to produce portable water with faster evaporation rate as well as higher efficiency for this purpose solar driven nanoparticle suspension evaporation ni et al 2015 and solar driven interfacial water evaporation siwe ghasemi et al 2014 technologies have been successively developed the former transfers the photo thermal conversion process from the bottom to the volume of the bulk water resulting in a significantly improvement in water evaporation efficiency amjad et al 2017 jin et al 2016 wang et al 2017c however to fully tap into the potential of the volumetric heating effect of the nanofluid evaporator carbon based nanoparticles with strong light absorption capacity over the entire spectral wavelength of solar energy are usually adopted dao and choi 2018 liu et al 2018b tao et al 2018 wang et al 2016a zeiny et al 2018 this swe device is not only high in material cost but also limited by some critical problems such as agglomeration and sedimentation of nanoparticles low recyclability and secondary pollution of bulk water esfe et al 2019 kazemi et al 2020 li et al 2017a qi et al 2019 qi et al 2020 the siwe technology has achieved efficient heat localization on the evaporator surface thanks to the continuous development of new and low cost energy materials hu et al 2017 liu et al 2017b xu et al 2017 xue et al 2017a by selectively heating surface water and generating local high temperature it has successfully achieved water evaporation efficiency of more than 80 under one sun illumination gong et al 2019 ito et al 2015 zhang et al 2017a making it an ideal way to replace the traditional swe technology superior pure water evaporation efficiency has been achieved by improving the optical performancetogether with the structure of the water transport pathway of the solar absorber however the attention to evaporation performance of saline water such as seawater waste water and sewage is rather limited chen et al 2018 yang et al 2018b c yi et al 2017 resulting in a considerable gap between the current technical level and practical applications the primary challenge faced by the solar driven interfacial saline water evaporation sise system is the deposition of crystalline salts in the solar absorber including the crystallization of solvable salts exceeding saturation concentration and accumulation of a small amount of dissolvable salts song et al 2018b zhu et al 2019 the deposited salts in the solar absorber not only alter the transport channel of capillary water but also reduce the light capture ability of the evaporation surface and hence leading to the imbalance of water supply and demand as well as reducing the evaporation efficiency of saline water liu et al 2017c zhou et al 2016b therefore the salt accumulation in evaporators is a serious barrier to the development of efficient and stable sise devices herein we review the state of the art research and development in salt removal from the sise evaporators different solutions have been proposed by different groups but there has yet to be a unified review discussing the general strategies for this purpose the latest achievements on the design of efficient solar absorber materials and structures from principle to implementation were reviewed we classified these strategies as remaining unsaturated evaporation of saline water preventing salt ions from contacting the solar absorber dissolving and or migrating back of crystalline salts and keeping salt crystallization away from evaporation area moreover the challenges and perspectives for developing high performance sise devices were also discussed the purpose of this review is to provide the latest achievements on the design of efficient solar absorber materials and structures for solving the problem of low efficiency causing by salt deposition during saline water evaporation as well as for promoting the application of sise technology 2 synopsis of the early developments and applications sise is a neotype portable water production technique when siwe is well developed fig 1 shows the schematic diagram of sise under irradiation of sunlight the temperature of the solar absorber at the water air interface rises rapidly after absorbing solar energy transferring heat to the adsorbed water the local high temperature formed in the evaporator accelerates the evaporation of water producing potable clean water through condensation concurrently the solute concentration on the surface of the solar absorber increases under the combined action of advection and diffusion therefore salts crystallize on the surface of solar absorber due to the accumulation of solute concentration advection dominated exceeding the solubility limit during continuous evaporation in a typical sise device the solar absorber is the most important component which captures sunlight converts radiant energy to thermal energy and drives water evaporation from all kinds of source water at a thin thickness apart from the surface of solar absorber it can also provide channels for vapor transportation as shown in fig 1 starting from these ideas many effective methods to improve evaporation efficiency were found in the last several years e g chang et al 2016 chen et al 2019b huang et al 2017 huang et al 2018 li et al 2018a liu et al 2015a tian et al 2015 wang et al 2017b zhao et al 2015 specially ghasemi et al 2014 firstly concentrated the absorbed solar energy within the surface layer of bulk water through a floating membrane they uniformly deposited exfoliated graphene in foam carbon which is of floatability the porous structure of foam carbon has very good wettability enabling to quickly wicking bulk water to the evaporator surface through capillary action because this material has good absorption for sunlight it can maintain the low temperature of bulk water under antivacuum condition as a result the thermal efficiency reached 85 under 10 suns illumination ghasemi et al 2014 this is one of the groundbreaking configurations that set off revolution in the field of interfacial water evaporation some review articles on this topic may refer to chen et al 2019a deng et al 2017 elsheikh et al 2019 gao et al 2019a li et al 2019d liu et al 2017a raza et al 2018 tao et al 2018 wang et al 2019f wu et al 2019b zhang et al 2018b 2019a zhou et al 2019a and zhu et al 2019a it can be concluded from the above literatures that the material property and structure of solar absorber are the breakthrough points to ensure efficient photo thermal evaporation 2 1 solar absorber materials the material of solar absorber determines the ability of the evaporator to absorb solar energy chen et al 2018 wang et al 2020 which is the prerequisite for improving evaporation efficiency li et al 2018b gao et al 2019a xue et al 2017b commonly used solar absorber materials include metal nanoparticles with plasmon resonance effect and black carbon based materials with wide spectral absorption range bae et al 2015 realized polarization independent and ultra wide spectral absorption by using flexible black gold film and adiabatic plasma nano focusing method zhu s group successfully achieved the preparation of black plasmon absorber zhou et al 2016a solved optical loss problem of the solar absorber zhou et al 2016b and designed a three dimensional 3d hollow cone shaped solar absorber with reduced incident angle dependence li et al 2017b inspired by the perspiration process of human skin liu et al 2015b and wang et al 2014 assembled gold nanoparticle based membranes at the air water interface to produce a reusable and efficient evaporator on the other hand comparing graphene based solar absorbers with different structures fu et al 2017 ito et al 2015 zhang et al 2017a it is found that the solar absorber containing porous network architecture has stronger capillary action endowing the evaporator with a better water supply capacity as reported by zhang et al 2020a the interlayer distance of monolayer graphene can be sufficiently tuned via lighting control thus promoting the selective interaction between ions and nanosheets they offered a new insight for the design of novel graphene based nanostructures to realizes super water flux and high separation performance without sacrifice in salt ions rejection higgins et al 2018 and wilson et al 2019 made use of carbonized cotton and carbon fiber and gong et al 2019 employed carbon sponge to obtain evaporation efficiency of more than 80 under standard solar irradiance they have developed recyclable expandable and inexpensive high efficiency solar absorbers to mimic the transpiration of plants liu et al 2018a and zhu et al 2017 manufactured high performance evaporators making up of various kinds of wood taking advantages of their natural channels and good heat and mass transmission besides metal nanoparticles and carbon based materials inorganic semiconductors and polymeric materials have also attracted great interests from scholars worldwide the recent progress in each of these classes has been reviewed in detail by chen et al 2019a dao et al 2020 elsheikh et al 2019 gao et al 2019a li et al 2019d pang et al 2020 wu et al 2019b zhao et al 2020 etc herein we pay special attention to the mos2 based materials which were rarely mentioned but are also of great importance nano sized mos2 is considered as one of the most promising solar desalination materials owing to its excellent solar absorbing performance easy compound processing and earth abundant reserves serving as a two dimentional 2d transition metal dichalcogenide it has been widely used to collect solar energy for hydrogen production disinfection and power generation in addition the internal pores and defects endow the mos2 nanosheets with ion selectivity thiruraman et al 2018 therefore controlling the surface morphology and porosity of mos2 nanosheets may be helpful to build a high efficiency sise device according to the report of yang et al 2018a the mos2 nanosheets and single walled nanotube composite membrane with a thickness of only 120 nm exhibited a light absorbing capacity exceeding 82 in the whole solar spectrum range which accounted for its impressively high evaporation efficiency of 92 under 5 suns illumination more importantly the superior mechanical strength of the hybrid film enables to maintain stable water permeability and high salt resistance the chemical exfoliating mos2 is another efficient scalable and low toxicity solar absorbing material making it a promising candidate for sise ghim et al 2018 recently zhang et al 2020b fabricated 3d dimpled mos2 membranes dmms with open macroporous networks showing that the 2h dmm generates high heat localization compared to 1t dmm after multiple illumination and regeneration cycles 2h dmm presented high salt rejection performance what s more the mos2 based solar absorbers of guo et al 2018 2020 achieved evaporation efficiency exceeding 90 likewise a high evaporation efficiency of 96 2 at 2 5 suns illumination were achieved by employing a bilayer membrane wang et al 2020 in this design the top layer was formed via embedding nanoscale mos2 onto framework of porous polyurethane sponge while the bottom layer was originated from polyurethane sponge with the hydrophilic pda coating note that the potential application of mos2 as a solar absorber for sise has not been fully determined at least the solar evaporation rate should be increased to make mos2 based evaporators more competitive with other advanced configurations that already show evaporation rate beyond theoretical limit 2 2 structural engineering in addition to the applications of multifunctional materials evaporators with desirable structures have also been manufactured concurrently making the solar to water efficiency exceeding 90 li et al 2018c ma et al 2019 qiao et al 2019 wang et al 2019c wu et al 2019c zhu et al 2019b to minimize the light reflection and diffused heat loss wang et al 2018 designed a cone shaped 3d structure which has the absorbance over 99 and a photo thermal conversion efficiency up to 93 8 under 2 suns illumination zhao et al 2018 developed a hierarchically nanostructured gels hngs based on polyvinyl alcohol pva and polypyrrole ppy as shown in fig 2 a under solar illumination the ppy in the molecular grid of the generator was heated which was beneficial to the evaporation of confined water in the polymer network see 1 in fig 2b evaporation enthalpy of confined water in molecular grid decreased the evaporated water can be quickly recovered through branched water diffusion see 2 in fig 2b and pumping see 3 in fig 2b based on microchannels and internal gaps the evaporation rate reached 3 2 kg m 2 h 1 with good stability and durability under one sun illumination coincidentally the superabsorbent hydrogel with pva and chitosan as hydration framework and ppy as solar absorber further increased the evaporation rate up to 3 6 kg m 2 h 1 zhou et al 2019b shi et al 2018a fabricated a 3d cylindrical cup shaped structure of mixed metal oxides the 3d structure achieved a high energy efficiency of 100 under one sun illumination due to multiple reflections of incident light as well as the negligible heat loss within the absorber the diffuse reflection fig 2c and thermal radiation fig 2d test results of a 2d disk structure and a 3d cup structure showed that the cup wall can effectively recover diffuse reflection light and thermal radiation it is generally believed that solar radiation limits evaporation rate assuming that the energy transfer efficiency of the solar to steam is 100 however li et al 2018c proved that the evaporation rate could far exceeding this limit through careful structural design and direct energy collection from the environment they argued that if the temperature of the evaporator was lower than the ambient temperature energy could be obtained from the environment and the evaporation rate could be greatly increased far higher than the theoretical limit since evaporative cooling can reduce the temperature of the side surface to be lower than the ambient temperature by adopting a carefully designed steam generator the net energy gain of the environment was realized by reducing the energy loss of the top surface and maximizing the energy gain of the side surface under the condition of different incident light intensities note that the interest of transforming the absorber structure from a traditional planar device to a macroscopic 3d structure to obtain solar steam efficiency close to or even greater than the theoretical limit has never waned hong et al 2018 kim et al 2018a song et al 2018a zhang et al 2018a which provided a new approach to improve the performance of sise devices 2 3 applications of sise for energy production natural water evaporation is a promising source of renewable energy however the availability and reliability of this resource and its impact on water resources have yet to be explored for a long time cavusoglu et al 2017 evaluated the energy that can be collected during the natural evaporation process on the surface of natural waters finding that the power density generated by this process was three times that of modern wind power if effective measures were taken to combine water evaporation with electrical production the shortages of clean water and electricity in remote areas can be synchronously solved neumann et al 2016 zhu et al 2019a the novel technique of using the energy released by water evaporation to generate electricity has been widely concerned for example ma et al 2013 developed a polymer film actuator that exchanged water with the environment to cause expansion contraction of membrane by combining rigid matrix and dynamic polymerization network the generator assembled by the actuator and piezoelectric element could continuously output alternating current of 0 3 hz with a peak voltage of 1 0v chen et al 2015 reported an evaporation driven engine that relied on water to generate electricity and collect steam to drive the light source when the engine was placed at the air water interface gao et al 2016a designed a nano generator driven by water vapor under low speed airflow to realize self maintenance of temperature oscillation characteristics without the use of mechanical or electronic auxiliary devices ding et al 2017 and xue et al 2017b found that due to the interaction between water molecules and the solar absorber together with the hydrodynamic force provided by water evaporation in the solar absorber water evaporation could generate a continuous voltage of up to 1 v in the centimeter scale carbon based solar absorber confined channel note that the devices they designed could not collect clean water simultaneously resulting in a huge waste of energy in order to solve this problem zhu et al 2018a combined solar distillation and power generation using ultra light nitrogen rich carbon sponge to pump water achieving effective in situ photo thermal evaporation the generated steam could also induce electrical output demonstrating the synergistic photo thermal utilization capability of sise and cogeneration it should be noted that the sise technology not only showed potentials in power production but also can provide energy for photo catalysis devices gao et al 2016b shi et al 2018 shi et al 2020 water purification geng et al 2019 han et al 2019 qin et al 2019 qiu et al 2019 high temperature steam production chang et al 2019 wang et al 2019d steam sterilization loeb et al 2019 xu et al 2019 zhang et al 2017b crude oil recovery sun et al 2020 chemical fuel production zhu et al 2019a wearable electronic equipment li et al 2019b thermochemical batteries shen et al 2019 etc since these application scenarios beyond the scope of this review they will not be discussed in detail here 3 evaluations of sise performance 3 1 evaporation efficiency in a typical evaporation process the initial evaporation capacity gradually increased owing to more incident photons were collected and converted into thermal energy providing latent heat enthalpy for the phase change of water however after a specific transient and initial period the evaporation rate remained stable indicating that a thermal balance was reached between absorption evaporation and heat loss the evaporation efficiency was defined as the ratio of energy consumed by water gasification to incident light intensity ghasemi et al 2014 jiang et al 2016 ni et al 2016 1 η m h lv q 100 where m is the evaporation rate of water under steady state conditions q is the power density at the surface of the evaporator and h lv is the sum of enthalpy for liquid vapor phase change including sensible and latent heat enthalpy 2 h lv λ lv c p δ t where λ lv c p and δt are latent heat of vaporization specific heat capacity and temperature rise of water respectively it should be noted that due to the lack of standardized measurement techniques and unified evaluation methods for the evaporation efficiency it is still difficult and unreliable to directly compare the reported performance of different sise devices chen et al 2019a li et al 2019c 3 2 heat losses the heat consumption at the steady state conditions can be subdivided into six categories hu et al 2017 li et al 2016 2018a xu et al 2017 yang et al 2018a i e 1 phase change enthalpy for steam generation 2 convection 3 radiation and 4 reflection losses from the top surface of evaporator to the surroundings 5 conduction loss to bulk water through the solar absorber and 6 convection loss to the surroundings from the lateral and bottom surfaces as schematically shown in fig 1 the ratio of solar energy to latent heat enthalpy and the consumption of steam generation were equal to the evaporation efficiency at steady state conditions caused by illumination only convection loss was calculated by newton s law of cooling 3 q conv h a ts t ts t f where h is the convective heat transfer coefficient of air in natural convection a ts is the top surface area while t ts and t f are the temperatures of the top surface and the ambient respectively radiation loss was calculated using the stefan boltzmann law 4 q rad ε a ts σ t ts 4 t f 4 where ε is the emissivity of the solar absorber and σ is the stefan boltzmann constant the reflection loss was equal to the reflectance of the solar absorber which was often measured using a high precision ultraviolet visible near infrared spectrophotometer the conduction loss to bulk water was calculated based on the temperature gradient of the bulk water and the fourier s law 5 q cond k a ts δ t δ where k is the thermal conductivity of the water and δ t δ is the temperature gradient for permeating the bulk water the convection heat loss from the lateral and bottom surfaces to the surroundings should be the difference between the incident energy and the total amount for the above five categories of energy consumptions 3 3 physical parameters eq 1 shows that the evaporation efficiency of sise device is related to evaporation rate phase change enthalpy and incident power density according to eq 2 the phase change enthalpy is a function of the latent heat of vaporization specific heat capacity together with temperature rise of water herein the measurement methods of these physical parameters in sise field are summarized evaporation rate the evaporation rate was defined as the productivity of solar drive steam per unit time and area at the steady state conditions compared with evaporation efficiency it can evaluate the performance of evaporator more accurate and comparable in a typical experiment a precision electronic balance was generally adopted to monitor the mass loss of bulk water i e evaporation capacity during evaporation the curve of mass loss per unit area as a function of time changed almost linearly after a certain period of illumination and the slope of this straight line was regarded as the evaporation rate phase change enthalpy the phase change enthalpy was the sum of sensible and latent enthalpy the latent enthalpy and specific heat capacity were usually taken from the physical properties of water at a given temperature and pressure ghasemi et al 2014 li et al 2018a however this oversimplified approach is not suitable to determine parameters of water in molecular meshes which have a reduced vaporization enthalpy therefore differential scanning calorimetric dsc measurements were conducted to determine the vaporization energy of water and water in the solar absorber the specific heat capacity was calculated by comparing the heat flow of measured solar absorber with that of the standard sample zhao et al 2018 zhou et al 2019b additionally temperature measurement was applied to not only analyze the thermal characteristics and energy transmission during evaporation but also to evaluate the potential applications of steam zhou et al 2019a in sise system the thermocouple and infrared thermal imaging techniques were generally employed to measure temperatures of the vapor bulk water and solar absorber compared with the thermocouple method the non invasive thermal imaging technique was used more widely might be its advantages in interference free high spatio temporal resolution and visualization of temperature distribution li et al 2019 power density whether the power density of the incident light is effectively measured is one of the decisive factors for the accurate evaluation of evaporation performance for this purpose optical power meter and standard solar cell were usually employed to calibrate the power density the optical power meter adopts thermopile technique which has wider spectral response range and thus has a higher accuracy the standard solar cell i e silicon cell however has narrower spectral response wavelength if the light irradiates the solar cell for a long time the physical accumulation of excess energy which cannot activate the electrons causes the temperature rise of cell li et al 2019a resulting in the measured value being smaller than the actual power density 4 greatest challenge crystalline salt deposition to improve evaporation capacity concentrators have to be used to improve solar irradiance this is because solar thermal distillation depends on the saturated vapor pressure of water which has an exponential relationship with temperature so that the output of purified water is exponentially related to light intensity dongare et al 2019 although significant progress has been made in material and structural developments as described in section 2 the deposition of salts during continuous operation hinders the maintenance and or enhancement of sise performance therefore the sise technology is still not ready for practical application especially because it lacks long term stability 4 1 mechanism of crystalline salt deposition sise is affected by many factors such as the water supply capacity of the solar absorber composition of the saline water interfacial performance and environmental conditions tao et al 2018 zhong et al 2019 essentially the advection diffusion transport of salt ions together with the evaporation efficiency of saline water determines the salt concentration on the evaporator surface as shown in fig 1 under solar illumination saline water containing salt ions is transported to the evaporation surface through advection to compensate for the evaporated water as a result both the ion concentration of the evaporation surface and the salinity gradient between the evaporation surface and the bulk water are increased on the other hand once the concentration gradient is formed the diffusive force drives salt ions to migrate from the surface of solar absorber to bulk water derluyn et al 2019 toksoz and yilmaz 2020 reducing the salt concentration on the evaporation surface therefore the nucleation position of salt crystals depends on the dynamic balance between advection of salt ions on the surface of the solar absorber and spontaneous diffusion of salts from high to low concentration areas note that when the concentration of salt increases continuously resulting in crystallization of salts on the active evaporation surface of solar absorbers reducing the evaporation efficiency caused by the increasing in reflection even worse the crystallized salts block the water supply pathway finnerty et al 2017 ren et al 2017 yang et al 2018a at night the formed salts gradually dissolve back and or diffuse into brine water which is contained in the microchannels of the solar absorber xu et al 2019b if the diameter of the micro channel in the solar absorber is large water can be quickly transported during relatively long operation in contrast if the solar absorber is mainly composed of nanochannels the channels will be blocked after several hours of operation zhu et al 2018b ito et al 2015 have reported that the micrometer sized pore channels are more appropriate for capillary action of water compared to the nanochannels this is because the nanosized pore channels may increase viscous resistance of water inhibiting the transportation of water to evaporative area note that this viewpoint has been generally accepted for example zhang et al 2020a revealed the effective access and diffusion of various ions and molecules in microchannels based on this mechanism in addition for solar absorber with microchannels the water fills the pores by capillary forces theoretically for a capillary channel a smaller pore size leads to a higher capillary pressure as a consequence there is a continuous progression from multi layer adsorption to capillary condensation in which the smaller pores may be more likely to be filled with water on the other hand although capillary fore can provide high water flux there is an inherent trade off between capillary pressure and flow resistance the former is inversely proportional while the latter is positively correlated to pore diameter therefore the capillary force is inversely proportional to flow resistance this trade off is more prominent in sise device because the thickness of the capillary force layer must be thick enough to minimize conductive heat loss at this point a thick insulation layer was generally used to separate the solar absorber and saline water ni et al 2018 resulting in the evaporation rate being far lower than the theoretically achievable zeng et al 2019 4 2 destructiveness of deposited salts the vapor transport is related to the pressure difference between the saturated vapor near the evaporation surface and the far field vapor there are two general mechanisms of solute concentration affecting water evaporation in porous media a to reduce vapor pressure by increasing solution osmotic pressure and b to reduce the vapor diffusion coefficient due to mechanical blockage of water pathways by crystalline salts mendez et al 2018 jambhekar et al 2015 therefore it can be inferred that the continuous salt accumulation will suppress vapor transportation deposition of salt crystals is directly manifested as the evaporation efficiency in saline water is much lower than that in clean water although the solar absorbers can absorb all incident solar energy wang et al 2017a 2017d zhang et al 2018c zhu et al 2018b for example kou et al 2019 developed low cost recyclable cotton carbon nanotube fabrics based on a simple dyeing process these cotton fabrics had good hydrophilicity flexibility and high absorbance 95 7 the evaporator except for the surface of polystyrene foam was insulated with cotton carbon nanotube fabric this configuration showed a seawater evaporation rate up to 1 59 kg m 2 h 1 when operating in saline water nacl 17 5 however solid salts were observed on the cotton fabric surface after running for 8 h more than 85 of the evaporation surface was covered resulting in the evaporation rate dropping to 0 54 kg m 2 h 1 a bench scale setup was built to evaluate the steam generation performance of the synthetic graphene oxide go leaf finnerty et al 2017 as shown in fig 3 a the configuration generated steam at a rate of 2 kg m 2 h 1 with an energy efficiency of 78 for fresh water however in highly concentrated saline water with concentrations of 7 and 15 the evaporator was covered by thick salt crust sheltering from the sunlight for several hours resulting in serious reduction in evaporation rate 0 71 and 0 5 kg m 2 h 1 respectively even vertically arranged carbon nanotube array that was close to black body absorption was employed as the solar absorber the evaporation efficiency in seawater was only 30 yin et al 2017 likewise a careful design of plasmonic wood coupling both the plasmonic effect of metal nanoparticles and the waveguide effect of microchannels in the wood matrix has been successfully realized zhu et al 2018b as shown in fig 3b the composite materialabsorbed 99 of the incident sunlight which achieved a solar energy conversion efficiency of 85 without recession after continuous operation at 10 suns illumination over 6 days the adversity showing the evaporation efficiency under one sun illumination was only 69 although salt formation on the surface of the plasmonic wood was not obvious by integrating a paper based reduced go composite prgo film on a silicon based porous insulation layer hydrophilic prgo membranes laterally pumped water from the periphery to the central evaporation area instead of vertically supplying water wang et al 2017d as shown in fig 3c this novel evaporation structure design fully eliminated the downward conduction heat loss from the evaporator to the bulk water although steady state evaporation efficiency of the sise system reached up to 89 7 when placing the evaporator on nacl solution with a concentration of only 3 5 the evaporation efficiency dropped to 76 recently hu et al proposed a janus evaporator with a low tortuous pore structure based on a sio2 cellulose nanofiber carbon nanotube hybrid network solar absorber hu et al 2019 the salt accumulation caused by water evaporation was limited to the hydrophobic hydrophilic interface and can be rapidly excreted through channels with low curvature fig 3d this structure offered evaporation rates of 1 25 kg m 2 h 1 in pure water and 1 09 kg m 2 h 1 in nacl solution with a concentration of 3 5 nonetheless the evaporator continuously desalinated for 100 h at one sun illumination with an evaporation efficiency exceeding 80 in addition the specially manufactured conical biomimetic 3d structure of wu et al 2020 showed an evaporation rate of 2 24 kg m 2 h 1 when operating at a nacl concentration of 25 which may be the highest record so far but still 15 lower than that at pure water 2 63 kg m 2 h 1 it should be noted that since only one kind of salt nacl was added to the simulated saline water this efficiency is bound to be further reduced in the real saline water abney et al 2017 kim et al 2018b loganathan et al 2017 which is a complex mixture of solid and liquid particles of organic and inorganic substances as mentioned above for most sise devices in the past salts may block the pathways for water supply and steam escape during evaporation and even further accumulated on the surface receiving light the salt covered surface would sacrifice the light collection capacity and prevent water pumping and steam transmission eventually deteriorating the evaporation performance and limiting the long term operation of the equipment in addition saline water conditions usually corroded the structure of the membrane morelos gomez et al 2017 which was rarely studied therefore it is necessary to pay attention to the stability and durability of the absorber for purpose of adopting these solar evaporation structures to generate steam competitively 5 advanced design concepts of salt removal conventional methods for addressing salt plugging problems include backwashing and physical removal however these approaches will interrupt continuous production resulting in increased operation cost and decreased productivity new photo thermal materials with antifouling performance and solar desalination systems with salt tolerance are urgently needed but have been challenging material structures for efficient economical and large scale desalination of saturated saline water should to exhibit the following characteristics simultaneously strong absorption of incident light buoyancy of the liquid vapor surface low thermal conductivity for heat localization at the liquid vapor interface anti clogging characteristics to prevent salt accumulation on the surface durability and flexibility for easy implementation and long lifetime guo et al 2019 liu et al 2019a in addition a complete salt removal sise devices should be planned with double functions 1 maintain a low ionic concentration in the heat localization area in which crystalline salts cannot be generated 2 timely transport the formed crystal substances to prevent salts accumulation in the solar absorber the former can be achieved by providing sufficient water supply and or preventing the accumulation of saline ions in solar absorber in the latter case salts have already formed so the deposited salts must be dissolved migrated back or collected basing on these concerns in this review the recent strategies for salt elimination from the sise devices are subdivided into remaining unsaturated evaporation of saline water preventing salt ions from contacting the solar absorber dissolving and or migrating back of crystalline salts and keeping salt crystallization away from evaporation area as schematically shown in fig 4 evaporation rate of sise devices based on different design concepts from the selected typical publications are listed in table 1 the up to date researches and developments in the above aspects will be summarized and discussed in detail in this section note that the now available evaporator designs often contain more than one of the above strategies to prevent salt accumulation as possible and we considered only the closest one for their classification 5 1 maintain a low ionic concentration in the heat localization area 5 1 1 remain unsaturated evaporation of saline water the crystallization in sise process belongs to evaporative crystallization which occurs only at the conditions of appropriate molar concentration of substances temperature and static evaporator therefore by comprehensively controlling these crystallization conditions unsaturated evaporation of saline water can be realized and salt precipitation can be prevented effectively note that the efficient sise devices should also have high solar energy absorption fast water transportation efficient solar steam evaporation and good thermal insulation song et al 2018b proposed a hierarchical silicon copper membrane composed of nanoscale hybrid materials with effective salt tolerance inspired by natural lotus leaves as shown in fig 5 a after the salt induced wetting property was changed the porous membrane showed a super hydrophobic light receiving surface and a super hydrophilic root like surface it is noteworthy that the porous membranes exhibited large contact surfaces omnidirectional light decay pathways effective salt removal capability and abundant hierarchical water supply and steam generation channels resulting in efficient and long term stable desalination performance without the accumulation of salts in saline water compared with other evaporators finnerty et al 2017 hu et al 2019 kou et al 2019 ren et al 2017 wang et al 2017a 2017d yin et al 2017 zhang et al 2018c zhu et al 2018b it is surprising that the evaporation efficiency was increased from 50 2 to 55 1 after 120 days of normal saline circulation fig 5b more interestingly even after 310 days of ultra long durability test in saline water the formation of a salt induced robust super hydrophilic interface layer on the pumping structure endowed the evaporator with a 7 8 improvement in evaporation efficiency fig 5b further research showed that the hierarchical structure served as an ion selective membrane to allow na to pass through while inhibiting cl from being destroyed during operation it should be noted that due to the limitation of the permeability of ion selective membrane crystalline salt deposition may also occur when operating on high salinity waters in this case the space between capillary surfaces may be shorten leading to significant increase of viscous resistance and also inhibiting saline water transportation liu et al 2019b synthesized black gold nanoparticles in situ on a magneto rheometer and formed sponges containing nanoparticles by in situ reduction at room temperature the melamine resin sponge pillars pumped the solution from the bottom to the top providing the water supply when the evaporation surface was separated from the bulk saline water which reduced heat transfer to bulk water during evaporation on the other hand the concentrated solution in both the sponge and dilute bulk solution could be moved and exchanged through the melamine resin sponge pillars to support self driven salt tolerance fig 5c the evaporation rate and efficiency were not significantly reduced and no solid salt was deposited after evaporation for 1 h even if the concentration was as high as 20 in addition after 11 h of evaporation the solar absorptivity decreased by less than 0 1 surprisingly the evaporation efficiency exceeded 90 in high salinity water this structure fundamentally avoided the formation of solid salts by using the self driving salt tolerance mechanism because this mechanism worked through the properties of solution and material it provided a general strategy for designing solar evaporators without salt deposition defects apart from the evaporation efficiency the cost of the evaporator cannot be ignored the use of low cost materials and manufacturing methods together with facile device regeneration to avoid salt accumulation are crucial to the development of sise technology trees are one of the richest raw materials on earth and play an important role in the ecosystem because the interface between carbonized wood and natural wood segments has perfect microstructure matching it is conducive to effective water supply andsalts removal a high efficiency solar steam device entirely made of natural wood was reported by zhu et al 2017 the original natural wood was cut along the transverse direction and the top surface was carbonized to form a unique double layer structure because the relatively slow evaporation rate hindered the ability of salt to reach its crystallization concentration at a low light intensity no salt was deposited under one sun illumination note that salt deposition was only apparent when the solar intensity was 5 suns but did not significantly reduce the steam generation performance similarly huang et al 2019 designed a ppy wood structure by in situ polymerization of pyrrole monomers into a 3d porous wood matrix salt accumulation was not obvious under one sun illumination when the nacl concentration was 3 5 however with the increase of salinity by 10 20 and saturation the ppy wood evaporator failed to maintain the balance with the original pore structure facing faster salt accumulation larger channels and higher hydraulic conductivity were required to maintain the function of salt discharge channels he et al 2019 proved that bimodal porous structure based on carbonized wood can be used as an efficient and stable solar steam generator for desalting high salt brine in the process of solar desalination the salinity of saline water in narrow tubules increased due to the rapid evaporation of water although the tracheid was too narrow to be fully replenished with saline water the high concentration saline water gradually diffused to the peripheral vascular channels through pits nano pores and ray parenchyma cells the nearby vessel passages helped to avoid salt crystals from forming on the evaporator surface because they increased the ability to exchange salt with bulk saline water fig 5d moreover many ray cells that periodically penetrated the micro channels contributed to the lateral transportation of saline water through diffusion or advection these inherent microstructures could effectively avoid the accumulation of salts during a long term solar steam generation process as a result no accumulation of any salt on the surface of the bimodal evaporator was observed after continuous operation for 7 h at 6 suns in the control experiment severe salt accumulation was observed on the surface of the polydimethylsiloxane wood structure when the large vessel passage of wood was blocked by polydimethylsiloxane and the tracheid was completely opened for saline water transportation which confirmed the importance of bimodal porous microstructure for long term efficient and anti accumulation solar desalination overall the tree inspired design provided a cheap and scalable solar energy collection and steam generation technology that can provide clean water in worldwide especially in rural or remote areas where water is not only scarce but also limited by water extraction materials and equipment chen et al 2018 liu et al 2018a wang et al 2017d 2019b e 5 1 2 prevent salt ions from contacting the solar absorber physically the phenomenon of salt crystallization will not occur if the free salt ions are limited outside the heat localization area or the ion concentration in this area is unsaturated this idea has been realized by floating a bilayer structure with hydrophobic upper layer and hydrophilic lower layer such as janus membrane on the surface of saline water natural moisture free hydrophobic surface is an effective way to prevent saline water infiltration however since most of the water is blocked the evaporation rate of the fully hydrophobic structure is significantly lower than that of the hydrophilic structure yang et al 2018b designed a hydrophilic hydrophobic bilayer nanopores structure which was consists of a hydrophobic salt tolerant hierarchical structure layer composed of a well defined array of cu2snse3 or cu2znse4 nano layers and a hydrophilic filtering membrane for continuous water supply and steam generation xu et al 2018 reported a flexible janus thin film evaporator with a polymethyl methacrylate pmma layer coated with hydrophobic carbon black cb on the top surface and a hydrophilic polyacrylonitrile pan layer on the bottom as shown in fig 6 a in this design salt can only deposit at the bottom of the hydrophilic layer and directly contacted and dissolved in the hydrophilic layer with bulk water owing to the insulation effect of hydrophobic pmma layer it was certain that janus structure avoided salt crystallization on the surface of the solar absorber and made solar desalination rather stable likewise gao et al 2019b manufactured a self floating janus solar absorber fig 6b which enabled to realize the sustainable collection of clean water by evaporation in this configuration candle soot was selectively deposited on one side of the cotton fabric while avoiding deposition on the opposite side the hierarchically porous structure on the coating side as well as the difference in wetting properties between the two sides endowed the possibility for water and steam to be well transported through the janus membrane under solar irradiation cooper et al 2018 adopted a solar absorber to transfer the non contact radiation to water and employed low intensity solar flux to generate steam in the non contact structure water worked as its own heat absorber making the equipment very strong vibrational absorption and free from pollution this device ran well for producing potable water from polluted and high salinity saline water without the risk of pollution or blockage similar design strategies can also be referred to the reports by zeng et al 2019 and zhang et al 2019 the above mentioned devices can be simply manufactured and operated well in saline water which provided reliable strategies for efficient saline water desalination special equipment and elaborate fabrication were not required for the manufacture of these evaporators they were expected to be the portable sise devices for the janus membranes however the structures need to be thin to avoid crystallizing at the hydrophilic hydrophobic interface resulting in insufficient heat localization and large conductive heat loss this is mainly because the thermal insulation layer separated the evaporation interface from the cold saline water below which salt removal was required inadequate repulsion led to structural blockage and eventually deteriorated the optical and core arranging performance of the structure in addition the assembled steam collection system restrained the steam flow conditions from those of open evaporation inhibiting evaporation and water collection rates moreover the stacking property of janus membrane limited the interlayer spacing to nanoscale hindering water diffusion from bulk water to the surface thus reducing evaporation rate zhang et al 2019 taken these shortcomings into consideration ni et al 2018 reported a salt resistant solar distiller by using a multilayer solar evaporator structure which was composed of a black cellulose fabric for solar absorption a composite white fabric wick and polystyrene foam insulation fig 6c f the white fabric was porous and hydrophilic allowing it to wick water to the upper solar evaporation structure while diffusing the concentrated salt back into the bulk water fig 6d the evaporation structure fig 6e was designed to collect the generated steam with the help of a condensation cover fig 6f therefore the evaporator showed long term stability when operating on nacl solution with a concentration of 3 5 and no salt deposition was found after continuous operation for 30 h under one sun illumination moreover the evaporation structure was placed on nacl simulated saline water while 40 g of solid nacl was directly added to the evaporation surface which was sufficient to saturate the entire wick structure incredibly the salts were completely dissolved within 1 h and steam was subsequently generated although a large amount of salt was placed on the top surface their research indicated that the evaporation structure not only can inhibit the formation of nacl in the process of solar evaporation for several consecutive days but also enabled to dissolve and inhibit salt deposition even under constant light conditions 5 2 prevent salts accumulation in the solar absorber 5 2 1 dissolve and or migrate back crystalline salts when neither of the above methods can completely eliminate the migration of anion cation withwater to the evaporation surface salt crystallization will inevitably occur during evaporation in this case the evaporators which are capable of rapidly dissolving crystalline salt and or supporting salt crystals falling back to the bulk water can be employed it has been reported that the seamless connection between nitrogen doped hydrophilic graphene nanoparticles n fgps and hydrophobic self assembled graphene foam associating with the self cleaning property of n fgp structure by redissolving the captured salt in the water channel can realize long term stable and continuous operation in real seawater for more than 240 h without degradation in evaporation efficiency wu et al 2019a recently wang et al 2019a designed an evaporator based on a blank hollow spacer fabric bhsf filled with chitosan and coated with rgo on its surface due to the unique hollow structure of bhsf the aligned large channel array 2 mm provided additional low bending pathways which in turn resulted in faster salt exchange between the aligned channel array and the bulk solution it promoted the concentrated solution to be transferred back to the bulk solution through the solar absorber therefore almost no solid salt existed on the surface of evaporator after operating for 60 min at one sun irradiation zhang et al 2019b proposed a self desalting solar evaporation system which was composed of rgo cotton fabric on vertically oriented porous polyacrylonitrile foam voppf as shown in fig 7 a results proved that there was no salt accumulation when desalting on simulated saline water 3 5 nacl for 12 h it was the hydrophilicity of cotton fabric the floatability of voppf on water and continuous pumping of water that promoted the re dissolution of salts and hindered its accumulation on the photo thermal layer during evaporation in the device designed by mohammadásajadi and hiáwang 2017 the material structure had a porous polymer skeleton with embedded graphite sheets and carbon fibers the geometry of the pores in this structure and the anti clogging coating prevented the accumulation of any salt importantly the poly 3 4 ethylenedioxythiophene poly styrenesulfonate on the surface of the evaporator had the characteristics of antifouling and preventing salts from adhering to the surface under the irradiation of one sun for more than 20 h the pores in this structure were still completely open as mentioned in section 5 1 the natural water circulation system simulating photosynthesis and transpiration of trees enabled to effectively improve the salt removal capacity of sise system which was considered as a promising strategy to solve the problem of global water shortage however there are still challenges in terms of relatively low delivery rate short delivery distance and unsatisfactory extraction efficiency therefore it is also an important direction pursued by researchers to develop sise system with high efficiency demineralization capability by adopting the biomimetic evaporators kuang et al 2019 designed a self excited solar evaporator with good antifouling performance by using a reasonably designed artificial channel array on a natural wood substrate as shown in fig 7b under the action of solar evaporation due to different hydraulic conductivity a salt concentration gradient was formed between millimeter level drilling channels with lower salt concentration and fine natural wood channels with higher salt concentration the concentration gradient allowed salt exchange between natural rivers to pass through the pits resulting in a miniaturized wooden channel for salt dilution the drilled channel with high hydraulic conductivity has the function of salt discharge which could quickly exchange salt with bulk solution and achieved real time self regeneration of evaporator this is because the movement of crystalline salts to bulk saline water is a spontaneous process driven by the chemical potential difference of different salt concentrations the dynamic factors of salt diffusion in the evaporator were also determined by the intrinsic properties of the membrane structure according to fick s law if the self cleaning process of salt pollution was considered as the diffusion of ions in porous media the structure of the automatic cleaning material must have high porosity and interconnected porosity to increase the diffusion coefficient of salt ions and migrate back to bulk water recently a water lily inspired hierarchical structure consists of a top solar absorber and a bottom bracket was designed by xu et al 2019a as shown in fig 7c and d unlike the previous studies water could not enter the absorber but formed a thin layer of water film between the top hydrophobic absorber and the bottom supporter fig 7e the absorbed solar energy was concentrated in this thin layer of water for evaporation when water evaporated salt solute drained down along the one dimensional channel with water solar evaporation was stable even when high concentration saline water was treated because the thin layer water used for solar evaporation was formed under the absorber instead of inside it fig 7e 5 2 2 keep salt crystallization away from evaporation area the solar evaporators reported in the references of ni et al 2018 and xu et al 2018 floated directly on saline water with a salt concentration of 3 5 and salts can be dissolved back into the bulk water without the problem of salt accumulation however this was equivalent to directly discharging salt back to the bulk saline water which still had environmental impact problems moreover high concentration of salt diffused back into the stock solution instead of being collected wasting the opportunity to obtain valuable mineral resources therefore proper management of salt crystallization during solar evaporation is an active demand for continuous steam production and simultaneous salt harvesting to address this issue shi et al 2018b developed a 3d cup shaped solar evaporator and zero liquid discharge high efficiency desalination was realized through solar distillation fig 8 a by reasonably separating the light absorption surface from the salting out surface the light absorption of the 3d solar evaporator was no longer affected by the salt shell layer like the traditional 2d solar evaporator fig 8b after 24 h exposure under one sun illumination an interesting observation was that although the growth and precipitation of salt crystals were very significant in all cases the inner cup wall was always clean without any salt coverage fig 8c moreover it can be operated at a very high salt concentration of 25 without significant water evaporation rate decay persisting 120 h this new design concept of solar energy evaporator provided a promising technology especially for the treatment of high salinity water to realize green zero liquid discharge seawater desalination and high salinity industrial wastewater treatment in seawater desalination plants additionally this design can realize the effective collection of crystalline salts during sise process if this is required it should be noted that if the purpose of the device is to produce salts rather than clean water salt blocking may be beneficial pramanik et al 2016 salmón et al 2018 recently the stable and continuous saline water evaporation was successfully realized through spatially isolating salt crystals from the saline water evaporation surface with the help of self harvesting feature of the salts xia et al 2019 as shown in fig 8d and e saline water was first delivered from the bulk solution to the center of the evaporator by cotton thread subsequently the saline water was transported from the center to the edge through filter paper due to its super hydrophilicity and well developed capillary channels in the process of solution transportation the local heating of solar absorber caused the water to evaporate continuously therefore concentration of nacl gradually increased when the saline water approaching the edge resulting in salt crystallization at the edge of the evaporator fig 8f it was easy to harvest the remaining salt crystallizes at the edge of the evaporator owing to that they would fall off under the action of gravity for the first time the authors achieved continuous steam production and solid salts harvesting without additional treatment the sise configuration designed by xu et al 2020 based on the identical principles showed a solar water conversion efficiency of over 40 together with a higher production efficiency of nacl than that of traditional salt farm technology when producing potable water from brine 10 w w wu et al 2020 printed a conical biomimetic 3d evaporator that achieved gradient distribution of interfacial water film through hierarchical water pathways the surface of the device exhibited position dependent water thickness and temperature gradient along the sidewall leading to the thermocapillary force inside the liquid film and the capability to capture energy from the surroundings when the evaporator was continuous operated in nacl solution with a concentration up to 25 salts would crystallize on apex of the evaporator as shown in fig 8g it should be noted that the evaporation rate did not decrease significantly 15 this is because that there was a layer of liquid film between the crystallized salt and the evaporator together with the existence of channels inside the crystalline salts fig 8h a configuration composed of a batch of biomimetic 3d evaporators was continuously exposed to sunlight in a closed system for 10 days with 9 h every day to test its durability as shown in fig 8i the stability and reproducibility of the specially manufactured evaporator was verified moreover the accumulated salts at the vertex of the evaporator can be easily removed and collected 6 conclusions and outlook as an emerging technology sise only uses the abundant solar energy and saline water to produce potable water which is one of the most important technologies to solve the problem of global water shortage however the deposition of crystalline salts during operation will inevitably reduce evaporation efficiency and even lead to shutdown of the equipment this paper comprehensively sorted out the latest researches and developments in salt removal from the sise devices the crystalline salts can be effectively avoided or reduced by remaining unsaturated evaporation of saline water preventing salt ions from contacting the solar absorber dissolving and or migrating back of crystalline salts and keeping salt crystallization away from evaporation area note that the lack of experimental experience in operating sise devices in complex environments and the unclear microscopic mechanisms affecting the water and or vapor transport in evaporators have resulted in a big gap between the current technical level and actual applications the following issues for suggestions would provide reference for the further development of this technology 1 salt blockage is the critical problem in the long term sise process especially for high salinity water sources a device that can address this issue is crucial to the development of sise technology and significant progress has been made this problem may be satisfactorily addressed by simultaneously employing low cost materials and inexpensive manufacturing methods using simple device regeneration to avoid salt accumulation and structural integrity of saline water extraction devices moreover surface wettability and pore structure modification have been proved to be effective to reduce clogging but also reduce evaporation efficiency therefore salt blockage is still a fundamental challenge inherent in all solar absorbers in direct contact with the saline water surface that need to be further studied 2 the real saline water conditions have the convection cooling effect of waves and currents which is rarely studied in the literatures in most previous solar evaporation experiments static water was added to the beaker thus adding extra heat insulation an extensible sise device not only has excellent salt resistance ability but also has the characteristics of strong spectral absorptivity low reflectivity self floating low thermal conductivity porosity and adaptability in complex environments it is still challenging to integrate these characteristics into an evaporator therefore it is necessary to find out the basic properties of evaporator and the influence of external meteorological environment on evaporation performance in addition attentions should also be payed to the critical thermophysical properties during saline water evaporation to comprehensively analyze the interaction between hydrodynamics and heat and mass transfer within and nearby the evaporators 3 the wettability is a critical characteristic affecting saline water evaporation which determines the transmission capability of capillary water in the solar absorber the absorption of incident light and the floatability of the device in the past the design principle was to improve the wettability of the solar absorber as possible by increasing the capillary water transport capacity of the solar absorber ignoring the heat loss caused by excessive wetting of the evaporation surface it is suggested that the problems of excessive and insufficient wetting of the evaporation surface of the solar absorber should be synergistically considered a subtle balance between the water supply and evaporation rates during saline water evaporation might be realized by adjusting the geometric structure of the solar absorber in combination with the experimental study of sise and the numerical simulation of heat and mass transfer of the solar absorber 4 the deposition of crystalline salts on the surface of solar absorbers is not only a great challenge for the development of sise technique but also a common scientific problem in multidisciplinary fields such as energy geology and hydrology understanding the physical process and mechanisms of salt evolution on the surface of solar absorber during sise are solid foundations for solving the problem of crystalline salt deposition recent researches have shown that the solute transport characteristics and interfacial evaporation behaviors are the key mechanisms affecting the morphologic evolution of crystalline salts due to the small temporal and spatial scales of sise evolution process the experimental study of solute transport mechanism is very complicated and thus the quantitative analysis of pore scale solute continuity dynamics involved in this physical process was rarely reported therefore it is necessary to deeply study the physical processes and mechanisms of morphologic evolution of crystalline salts on the surface of solar absorber basing on the advection diffusion theory and evaporation behaviors declaration of competing

17934,today s wastewater utilities are facing the dilemma of balancing pathological threats of bacteria and viruses in their effluent against health threats associated with the byproducts of disinfection a possible solution to this dilemma is to adopt secondary treatment technologies capable of concurrent pathogen reduction minimizing the demand for external disinfectants towards this end bacterial and viral reductions possible in algal wastewater treatment wwt systems are highlighted here and compared with those in conventional activated sludge as systems and membrane bioreactor mbr systems high log reduction values lrv of e coli 5 and fecal coliform 7 have been achieved without any external disinfectants in the classical photoautotrophic algal wwt systems and in an emerging mixotrophic algal wwt system lrvs of e coli fecal coliform and somatic coliphages in the mixotrophic system are higher than those in as systems and comparable to those in mbrs but lrvs of f specific coliphages enterovirus and norovirus gi are greater in mbrs than in the mixotrophic and as systems the low energy algal wwt systems providing high inherent reductions of bacteria and viruses can serve as affordable alternatives to the capital and energy intensive as and mbr systems for greener wwt meeting several of the united nation s sustainable development goals graphical abstract image 1 keywords e coli reduction fecal coliform reduction virus reduction inactivation factors galdieria sulphuraria 1 current practice of urban wastewater treatment wwt publicly owned treatment works potws are mandated to reduce the physical chemical and pathological contaminants in urban wastewaters to statutory discharge standards to fulfill this mandate potws have relied on multiple processes each requiring its own hydraulic residence time hrt in a dedicated reactor metcalf et al 2013 although these processes have served well in meeting discharge standards and protecting public health and receiving water quality their energy and resource footprints and life cycle impacts have now been a concern jenssen et al 2007 potential for formation of harmful byproducts during effluent disinfection is now recognized as an additional concern krasner et al 2009 recognizing the above concerns professional societies and regulatory agencies have recommended the development of improved or alternate wwt technologies that are greener sustainable and affordable asce 2017 us epa 2014 in response several research groups have been proposing enhancements to existing wwt processes and or developing alternate wwt technologies mccarty et al 2011 among the emerging alternate technologies algal based systems have been found to have lower life cycle impacts than the capital and energy intensive conventional technologies garfí et al 2017 2 algal based systems for sustainable wwt ability of algal based systems in meeting the discharge standards for biochemical oxygen demand bod ammoniacal nitrogen n and phosphates p with lower energy input has been well documented li et al 2011 their ability to simultaneously reduce pathogen indicators has also been documented craggs et al 2004 however field data on bacteria virus reductions in algal wwt systems are dispersed in journals of different topics and disciplines and have not been appraised and recognized ansa et al 2015 for example a recent life cycle assessment lca comparing high rate algal ponds hrap with the traditional activated sludge as systems did not include their pathogen inactivation capability arashiro et al 2018 2 1 classical algal processes for wwt algal wwt systems such as the hraps that utilize the symbiosis of photoautotrophic algae and heterotrophic bacteria have evolved since the 1950s and are in wide use today in hraps this mutualistic symbiosis affords single step removal of bod n and p conserving the aeration energy consumed in the as process for bod removal and in the subsequent nitrification denitrification nd process for n removal since aeration accounts for 25 40 of the energy budget of potws gu et al 2017 algal wwt systems can significantly reduce the cost of utility service and its carbon footprint recent lcas of conventional as systems constructed wetlands and hraps have shown that the as systems ranked worst with 2 5 times higher environmental impacts than the other two garfí et al 2017 another lca by arashiro et al 2018 comparing hraps with as systems concluded that hraps might increase the sustainability and cost effectiveness of wwt especially in small communities in warm regions when coupled with biofertilizer production although these lcas had not credited the hraps with their pathogen inactivation capabilities their findings affirm the advantages of algal based wwt systems 2 2 emergent mixotrophic algal process for wwt an alternate algal wastewater treatment a wwt system exploiting an extremophilic mixotrophic culture galdieria sulphuraria has been recently demonstrated at a pilot scale henkanatte gedera et al 2015 differing from the classical hraps in several aspects this a wwt system offers many advantages including higher biomass growth rates comparable or better volumetric removal rates of bod n and p higher lipid accumulation beneficial in biofuel recovery from the resulting biomass and metabolic flexibility in utilizing organic carbon and or sunlight for growth nirmalakhandan et al 2019 acidic culture condition in the a wwt system ph 2 5 4 0 is beneficial in resisting invasion and contamination reducing volatile loss of ammonia n yielding higher biomass production and possible downstream recovery and pathogen inactivation viability of algal wwt systems and their life cycle advantages over the as systems have been well documented from the perspective of bod n and p removal their additional benefit in simultaneous reduction of bacteria and viruses is assessed here against reported data on as systems and membrane bioreactors mbrs it is acknowledged that direct rigorous comparisons among literature reports may not be conclusive due to the wide variance and inconsistencies in the metadata underlying the reported results nevertheless generalized comparisons could be beneficial in assessing and pursuing the potential of the algal pathway as a sustainable one for concurrent reductions of bod n p and bacteria and viruses 3 reduction of escherichia coli e coli a wwt system vs hraps since the us national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes has set e coli as the indicator of potential fecal contamination most studies have limited their reporting to e coli measures several have assessed e coli reductions in algal systems fed with raw and partially treated wastewaters buchanan 2014 fig 1 a shows a bubble plot of hrt as a function of influent and effluent e coli concentrations in 14 phototrophic systems measured as cfu 100 ml and that in the mixotrophic a wwt system measured as gene copies ml most hraps could achieve 1 3 log reduction of e coli at hrt of 2 5 days irrespective of design configuration or feed water quality buchanan 2014 craggs et al 2004 2003 young et al 2016 the unusually high log reduction value lrv of 9 at an hrt of 4 days in an experimental batch hrap fed with the effluent of a biological wwt plant sebastian and nair 1984 is attributed to the high operating ph of 11 1 in contrast ph in all the other studies in fig 1 a ranged from 7 0 to 9 5 data for the mixotrophic a wwt system obtained from a nucleic acid based method qpcr method corresponds to 5 44 log reduction of e coli gene copy number in 5 days this method quantifies gene copies using sequence specific primers and probes but fails to distinguish between viable and non viable cells law et al 2014 therefore influent culturable e coli count in the case of a wwt will be lower and its lrv will probably be 5 44 logs while recognizing that results of culture based methods and of qpcr methods may not be directly comparable the ability of the a wwt system in eliminating e coli gene copies is noteworthy as it indicates complete removal of viable and non viable cells 4 reduction of fecal coliforms a wwt system vs hraps while e coli is a specific indicator of fecal contamination fecal coliform has been commonly used instead due to the rapid and simple detection method us epa and the world health organization have recommended fecal coliform based guidelines for using treated water for beneficial reuse bastian and dan 2012 fig 1 b shows hrt as a function of influent and effluent fecal coliform concentrations in 17 phototrophic systems and the mixotrophic a wwt system hraps could achieve 1 3 7 log reduction of fecal coliforms doma et al 2016 el hamouri 2009 el hamouri et al 1994 several studies have discussed fecal coliform removal capabilities of phototropic systems fed with anaerobically treated wastewater el shafai et al 2007 el hamouri 2009 van der steen et al 2000 demonstrated that algal and duckweed integrated systems are more effective in reducing fecal coliforms at a smaller footprint lrvs for e coli 5 44 and fecal coliforms 7 15 recorded in the mixotrophic system are higher than those in phototrophic systems fig 1 a and b in the case of fecal coliform hrt in the a wwt system was under one day lrv 7 while that in the hraps ranged 3 28 days average lrv 3 higher lrvs translate to lower final disinfectant demand and hence lower potential for formation of disinfection byproducts dbps petterson and stenström 2015 shorter hrts translate to smaller footprints and hence lower initial costs 5 factors causing bacteria and virus reduction in algal based wwt 5 1 bacteria reduction high innate inactivation recorded in algal wwt systems has been attributed to the following cultivation conditions extended exposure to sunlight high dissolved oxygen do extreme ph elevated temperature attachment to biomass and sedimentation starvation and presence of algal biomass and or algal toxins ansa et al 2015 irrespective of the type of reactor or the mode of operation most of these factors are known to act synergistically sunlight is the dominant inactivation factor in algal systems interacting with ph do and sensitizers craggs et al 2004 alkaline ph conditions ph 9 in phototrophic algal systems sebastian and nair 1984 ph variations under light and dark resulting from photosynthesis and respiration and limitation of carbon source van der steen et al 2000 also can contribute to bacterial inactivation in contrast inactivation in the acidic ph 2 5 4 mixotrophic a wwt system has been shown to be due to the synergistic effect of low ph direct and indirect inactivation by sunlight high do 5 1 7 8 mg l and above ambient temperatures 45 c munasinghe arachchige et al 2019 5 2 virus reduction sunlight do and sensitizers have been found to inactivate ms2 coliphages in waste stabilization ponds kohn and nelson 2006 physical removal by attachment onto larger biomass and subsequent sedimentation can also reduce viruses in pond systems verbyla and mihelcic 2015 sunlight mediated inactivation denaturation of proteins and nucleic acids due to extreme temperatures and ph conditions can also contribute to virus reduction in algal wwt systems while natural organic matter and do can enhance sunlight mediated virus inactivation kohn and nelson 2006 verbyla and mihelcic 2015 predation of viruses by species at higher trophic levels can also cause virus reduction verbyla and mihelcic 2015 6 comparison of a wwt system with existing systems 6 1 a wwt vs as systems

et al 2020 fig 2 a compares typical ranges of lrvs of e coli and coliphages reported for secondary treatment processes st1 bastian and dan 2012 st2 flapper et al 2012 against those reported by delanka pedige et al 2019 for the pilot scale a wwt system mt and the parallel secondary system st3 higher lrv in st3 compared to st1 and st2 is probably due to the tf preceding the as system this comparison implies higher bacterial reduction in the a wwt system than in the traditional secondary process beneficial in reducing downstream disinfectant demand and potential for dbp formation fig 2 b shows typical lrvs for e coli as a function of chlorine demand quantified as c t mg min l in clean water data source petterson and stenström 2015 while recognizing that chlorine demand in treated wastewater may be greater than that in clean water fig 2 a and b are integrated here to illustrate that the a wwt system has the potential to significantly reduce the final chlorine demand relative to the traditional secondary process for instance considering the data reported in us epa bastian and dan 2012 st1 in fig 2 a and flapper et al 2012 st2 in fig 2 a the secondary process can provide inactivation equivalent to c t of 0 03 mg min l whereas the a wwt system can provide inactivation equivalent to c t of 4 mg min l these inactivation results along with previous reports on the capability of the a wwt system in single step removal of bod n and p to their respective discharge standards henkanatte gedera et al 2015 tchinda et al 2019 endorse the notion that the a wwt system can potentially be a greener and more cost effective alternative to the current wwt systems 6 2 a wwt vs mbr systems in mbrs ultrafiltration and microfiltration membranes are integrated with the as

produced for indirect or direct potable reuse with minimal downstream disinfection 7 outlook pathogen reduction during secondary treatment can be due to physical removal or inactivation in as systems bacteria and viruses are physically removed by gravity settling adsorption or entrapment into biological flocs and in mbrs mainly by size exclusion bastian and dan 2012 pepper et al 2006 as such waste biomass in as and mbr systems are prone to bacterial and viral contamination necessitating follow up treatment to prevent health and ecological risks of their use as fertilizers or soil amendment pepper et al 2006 in the a wwt system extreme culture conditions contributed synergistically to pathogen inactivation while physical removal via adsorption onto algal biomass was negligible munasinghe arachchige et al 2019 munasinghe arachchige et al 2019 as such minimal or no disinfection would be required for downstream use of biomass generated in the a wwt system based on previous reports and the above evaluations the a wwt system can be potentially more affordable due to lower disinfectant demand and lower hrts than hraps the energy input to the a wwt system is expected to be significantly lower than in the as based systems due to the saving in aeration energy on going studies have estimated the energy input to the pilot scale a wwt system for mixing as 0 6 kwh m3 and that for the parallel full scale as system as 1 2 kwh m3 reduced fossil fuel usage and greenhouse gas emissions resulting from lower energy demand avoidance of n2o emissions associated with the nd step avoidance of atmospheric release of ammonia and lower potential for dbp formation can position the a wwt system as a greener alternative to the current systems 8 conclusions algal systems have an innate capability to inactivate bacteria and viruses in municipal wastewater compared to the classical phototrophic algal wastewater treatment systems the emergent mixotrophic system can provide similar or better inactivation but in shorter hydraulic residence times the emergent mixotrophic algal system affords higher log removals of bacterial and viral indicators than the activated sludge based systems higher bacteria and virus inactivation in the mixotrophic wastewater treatment system can translate to lower disinfection demand and minimize the potential for the formation of

17934,today s wastewater utilities are facing the dilemma of balancing pathological threats of bacteria and viruses in their effluent against health threats associated with the byproducts of disinfection a possible solution to this dilemma is to adopt secondary treatment technologies capable of concurrent pathogen reduction minimizing the demand for external disinfectants towards this end bacterial and viral reductions possible in algal wastewater treatment wwt systems are highlighted here and compared with those in conventional activated sludge as systems and membrane bioreactor mbr systems high log reduction values lrv of e coli 5 and fecal coliform 7 have been achieved without any external disinfectants in the classical photoautotrophic algal wwt systems and in an emerging mixotrophic algal wwt system lrvs of e coli fecal coliform and somatic coliphages in the mixotrophic system are higher than those in as systems and comparable to those in mbrs but lrvs of f specific coliphages enterovirus and norovirus gi are greater in mbrs than in the mixotrophic and as systems the low energy algal wwt systems providing high inherent reductions of bacteria and viruses can serve as affordable alternatives to the capital and energy intensive as and mbr systems for greener wwt meeting several of the united nation s sustainable development goals graphical abstract image 1 keywords e coli reduction fecal coliform reduction virus reduction inactivation factors galdieria sulphuraria 1 current practice of urban wastewater treatment wwt publicly owned treatment works potws are mandated to reduce the physical chemical and pathological contaminants in urban wastewaters to statutory discharge standards to fulfill this mandate potws have relied on multiple processes each requiring its own hydraulic residence time hrt in a dedicated reactor metcalf et al 2013 although these processes have served well in meeting discharge standards and protecting public health and receiving water quality their energy and resource footprints and life cycle impacts have now been a concern jenssen et al 2007 potential for formation of harmful byproducts during effluent disinfection is now recognized as an additional concern krasner et al 2009 recognizing the above concerns professional societies and regulatory agencies have recommended the development of improved or alternate wwt technologies that are greener sustainable and affordable asce 2017 us epa 2014 in response several research groups have been proposing enhancements to existing wwt processes and or developing alternate wwt technologies mccarty et al 2011 among the emerging alternate technologies algal based systems have been found to have lower life cycle impacts than the capital and energy intensive conventional technologies garfí et al 2017 2 algal based systems for sustainable wwt ability of algal based systems in meeting the discharge standards for biochemical oxygen demand bod ammoniacal nitrogen n and phosphates p with lower energy input has been well documented li et al 2011 their ability to simultaneously reduce pathogen indicators has also been documented craggs et al 2004 however field data on bacteria virus reductions in algal wwt systems are dispersed in journals of different topics and disciplines and have not been appraised and recognized ansa et al 2015 for example a recent life cycle assessment lca comparing high rate algal ponds hrap with the traditional activated sludge as systems did not include their pathogen inactivation capability arashiro et al 2018 2 1 classical algal processes for wwt algal wwt systems such as the hraps that utilize the symbiosis of photoautotrophic algae and heterotrophic bacteria have evolved since the 1950s and are in wide use today in hraps this mutualistic symbiosis affords single step removal of bod n and p conserving the aeration energy consumed in the as process for bod removal and in the subsequent nitrification denitrification nd process for n removal since aeration accounts for 25 40 of the energy budget of potws gu et al 2017 algal wwt systems can significantly reduce the cost of utility service and its carbon footprint recent lcas of conventional as systems constructed wetlands and hraps have shown that the as systems ranked worst with 2 5 times higher environmental impacts than the other two garfí et al 2017 another lca by arashiro et al 2018 comparing hraps with as systems concluded that hraps might increase the sustainability and cost effectiveness of wwt especially in small communities in warm regions when coupled with biofertilizer production although these lcas had not credited the hraps with their pathogen inactivation capabilities their findings affirm the advantages of algal based wwt systems 2 2 emergent mixotrophic algal process for wwt an alternate algal wastewater treatment a wwt system exploiting an extremophilic mixotrophic culture galdieria sulphuraria has been recently demonstrated at a pilot scale henkanatte gedera et al 2015 differing from the classical hraps in several aspects this a wwt system offers many advantages including higher biomass growth rates comparable or better volumetric removal rates of bod n and p higher lipid accumulation beneficial in biofuel recovery from the resulting biomass and metabolic flexibility in utilizing organic carbon and or sunlight for growth nirmalakhandan et al 2019 acidic culture condition in the a wwt system ph 2 5 4 0 is beneficial in resisting invasion and contamination reducing volatile loss of ammonia n yielding higher biomass production and possible downstream recovery and pathogen inactivation viability of algal wwt systems and their life cycle advantages over the as systems have been well documented from the perspective of bod n and p removal their additional benefit in simultaneous reduction of bacteria and viruses is assessed here against reported data on as systems and membrane bioreactors mbrs it is acknowledged that direct rigorous comparisons among literature reports may not be conclusive due to the wide variance and inconsistencies in the metadata underlying the reported results nevertheless generalized comparisons could be beneficial in assessing and pursuing the potential of the algal pathway as a sustainable one for concurrent reductions of bod n p and bacteria and viruses 3 reduction of escherichia coli e coli a wwt system vs hraps since the us national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes has set e coli as the indicator of potential fecal contamination most studies have limited their reporting to e coli measures several have assessed e coli reductions in algal systems fed with raw and partially treated wastewaters buchanan 2014 fig 1 a shows a bubble plot of hrt as a function of influent and effluent e coli concentrations in 14 phototrophic systems measured as cfu 100 ml and that in the mixotrophic a wwt system measured as gene copies ml most hraps could achieve 1 3 log reduction of e coli at hrt of 2 5 days irrespective of design configuration or feed water quality buchanan 2014 craggs et al 2004 2003 young et al 2016 the unusually high log reduction value lrv of 9 at an hrt of 4 days in an experimental batch hrap fed with the effluent of a biological wwt plant sebastian and nair 1984 is attributed to the high operating ph of 11 1 in contrast ph in all the other studies in fig 1 a ranged from 7 0 to 9 5 data for the mixotrophic a wwt system obtained from a nucleic acid based method qpcr method corresponds to 5 44 log reduction of e coli gene copy number in 5 days this method quantifies gene copies using sequence specific primers and probes but fails to distinguish between viable and non viable cells law et al 2014 therefore influent culturable e coli count in the case of a wwt will be lower and its lrv will probably be 5 44 logs while recognizing that results of culture based methods and of qpcr methods may not be directly comparable the ability of the a wwt system in eliminating e coli gene copies is noteworthy as it indicates complete removal of viable and non viable cells 4 reduction of fecal coliforms a wwt system vs hraps while e coli is a specific indicator of fecal contamination fecal coliform has been commonly used instead due to the rapid and simple detection method us epa and the world health organization have recommended fecal coliform based guidelines for using treated water for beneficial reuse bastian and dan 2012 fig 1 b shows hrt as a function of influent and effluent fecal coliform concentrations in 17 phototrophic systems and the mixotrophic a wwt system hraps could achieve 1 3 7 log reduction of fecal coliforms doma et al 2016 el hamouri 2009 el hamouri et al 1994 several studies have discussed fecal coliform removal capabilities of phototropic systems fed with anaerobically treated wastewater el shafai et al 2007 el hamouri 2009 van der steen et al 2000 demonstrated that algal and duckweed integrated systems are more effective in reducing fecal coliforms at a smaller footprint lrvs for e coli 5 44 and fecal coliforms 7 15 recorded in the mixotrophic system are higher than those in phototrophic systems fig 1 a and b in the case of fecal coliform hrt in the a wwt system was under one day lrv 7 while that in the hraps ranged 3 28 days average lrv 3 higher lrvs translate to lower final disinfectant demand and hence lower potential for formation of disinfection byproducts dbps petterson and stenström 2015 shorter hrts translate to smaller footprints and hence lower initial costs 5 factors causing bacteria and virus reduction in algal based wwt 5 1 bacteria reduction high innate inactivation recorded in algal wwt systems has been attributed to the following cultivation conditions extended exposure to sunlight high dissolved oxygen do extreme ph elevated temperature attachment to biomass and sedimentation starvation and presence of algal biomass and or algal toxins ansa et al 2015 irrespective of the type of reactor or the mode of operation most of these factors are known to act synergistically sunlight is the dominant inactivation factor in algal systems interacting with ph do and sensitizers craggs et al 2004 alkaline ph conditions ph 9 in phototrophic algal systems sebastian and nair 1984 ph variations under light and dark resulting from photosynthesis and respiration and limitation of carbon source van der steen et al 2000 also can contribute to bacterial inactivation in contrast inactivation in the acidic ph 2 5 4 mixotrophic a wwt system has been shown to be due to the synergistic effect of low ph direct and indirect inactivation by sunlight high do 5 1 7 8 mg l and above ambient temperatures 45 c munasinghe arachchige et al 2019 5 2 virus reduction sunlight do and sensitizers have been found to inactivate ms2 coliphages in waste stabilization ponds kohn and nelson 2006 physical removal by attachment onto larger biomass and subsequent sedimentation can also reduce viruses in pond systems verbyla and mihelcic 2015 sunlight mediated inactivation denaturation of proteins and nucleic acids due to extreme temperatures and ph conditions can also contribute to virus reduction in algal wwt systems while natural organic matter and do can enhance sunlight mediated virus inactivation kohn and nelson 2006 verbyla and mihelcic 2015 predation of viruses by species at higher trophic levels can also cause virus reduction verbyla and mihelcic 2015 6 comparison of a wwt system with existing systems 6 1 a wwt vs as systems
