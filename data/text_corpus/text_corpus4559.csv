22795,nonlinearities inherent in the dynamic system lead the motion response of moored floating structure to be non gaussian processes and the short term motion response prediction based on rayleigh distribution therefore becomes inaccurate this paper proposes a probability density function pdf termed as the hybrid rayleigh and weibull distribution hrw to accurately characterize the probability distribution of motion amplitude of moored floating structures in the hrw model the rayleigh distribution is adopted to depict wave frequency wf motion amplitude and the weibull distribution is employed to describe low frequency lf motion amplitude since the probability contribution of wf and lf motion amplitude in total motion amplitude depends on the occurrence frequency of wf and lf motion amplitude a weighting factor related to the mean up crossing rate of wf and lf motion response is introduced in the hrw model to combine the rayleigh and weibull distribution the proposed hrw model can consider the statistical interference effects of wf and lf motion and has an advantage of characterizing wf and lf motion amplitude simultaneously to verify the effectiveness of the proposed hrw model a case study for a moored semi submersible was conducted numerical calculation results indicate that the proposed hrw model not only yields accurate short term motion response prediction but also has robustness under severe sea states keywords moored floating structure probability distribution rayleigh distribution weibull distribution short term response prediction 1 introduction the motion response and mooring line tension are important parameters for floating structure mooring system design liu and bergdahl 1999 however due to the existence of second order nonlinear wave force and coupling effect between floating vessel and the mooring system the prediction of integrated motion response of the floating structure has to consider responses in two distinct frequency regimes namely wave frequency wf and low frequency lf at the system resonances naess 1989 low 2010 since the second order wave force is a non gaussian process and the floating structure coupled with mooring system is also a nonlinear system the wf and lf motion response are both non gaussian processes chang et al 2017 lim and kim 2018 and this calls for nonstandard methods to accurately predict the short term motion response of moored floating structures to estimate the short term motion response of a moored floating structure there are two kinds of approaches available namely the time domain method and the frequency domain method low 2010 in the time domain method the wf and lf motion responses can be simulated simultaneously and the influence of system s nonlinearity and non gaussian excitation on motion response can be taken into consideration adequately via the coupled dynamic analysis song and wang 2019 the short term motion response which is referred as 1 n th highest expected motion amplitude can be evaluated from the motion response series in a straight forward manner kato et al 1990 the motion responses obtained from the time domain method is more accurate than those of frequency domain nevertheless the time domain dynamic analysis requires high computational cost not only because the short term variability contributed from random waves asking for multiple realizations to acquire statistical convergence low and huang 2017 but also for the simulation duration should last long enough to acquire sufficient information concerning the extreme statistics low 2010 especially for the long term response prediction a large number of short term sea states involves into the coupled dynamic analysis to get the rigorous results and hence the computational burden increases significantly to reduce the computational effort of time domain method naess et al 2007 proposed an extrapolation method based on the monto carlo simulation to curtail the requisite quantity of simulation data sagrilo et al 2011 further developed a straight forward approach which can take the statistical uncertainly associated with the simulation length into consideration to determine the short term motion response based on a single time series recently low and huang 2017 presented an efficient method to estimate the long term motion response via time domain simulation in which a subset simulation was adopted to tackle the short term variability and the important sampling technology was used to suppress the sampling variability arising from long term uncertainty although several methods have been developed to improve the efficiency of time domain method the time domain method is still very time consuming for the frequency domain method the motion response process is considered as a stationary and ergodic random process and the probability distribution of the motion amplitude can be fitted by a specific pdf the short term motion response can be easily estimated from the pdf of motion amplitude it is known that the probability distribution of the amplitude associated with a narrow banded gaussian random process follows rayleigh distribution bendat and piersol 2000 ross 2000 however due to the existence of second order wave force and mooring system the motion response of a moored floating structure is a non gaussian process low and langley 2008 and the short term motion response determined from rayleigh distribution therefore becomes inaccurate and conservative park et al 2014 kato et al 1990 pointed out that the probability distribution of wf motion amplitude can be approximated by the rayleigh distribution while the probability distribution of lf motion amplitude can be represented by the generalized laguerre polynomials of which the first term was gamma function with three parameters the short term motion response can be estimated separately from the rayleigh distribution and laguerre polynomials in prior and then further be combined together with an empirical rule as the design code suggested by ship classification societies api 2005 dnvgl 2008 furthermore it should be mentioned that the peaks and valleys of wf and lf motion response almost do not occur simultaneously and a linear combination of the wf and lf motion response is too conservative grime and langley 2008 to combine the wf and lf motion response reasonably naess 1989 proposed a modified square root of sum of squares srss combination formula which can consider the correlation between wf and lf motion response to estimate the short term motion response but the correlation factor of the srss formula was quite difficult to determine naess 1994 utilized the tail behavior of motion response s pdfs to obtain the correlation factor with and without considering the interference of wf and lf motion response and kinoshit and takase 1995 employed the experimental results to determine the correlation factor actually the wf and lf motion response are not mutually independent and the short term motion response estimated from the combination formulae may deviate from the real ones the short term motion response is recommended to be evaluated based on the pdf of total motion amplitude directly to get more accurate results however there appears to be fewer studies on the pdf of total motion amplitude naess et al 2007 investigated the statistics of total motion responses based on a nonlinear motion equation but this subject is still unsolved owing to its complex nonlinearities it has been confirmed that the frequency domain method is a powerful tool to predict the short term motion response but there is not yet a pdf that can accurately depict the probability distribution of total motion amplitude of a moored floating structure the primary objective of this paper is to develop a new pdf model to accurately characterize the total motion amplitude which can improve the short term motion response prediction of moored floating structures the newly developed pdf model named the hybrid rayleigh and weibull distribution hrw is a combination way of the rayleigh and weibull distribution in the new hrw model the rayleigh distribution is utilized to depict wf motion amplitude while the two parameter weibull distribution is employed to represent lf motion amplitude because the probability distribution of wf and lf motion amplitude in total motion amplitude depends on the occurrence frequency of wf and lf motion amplitude a weighting factor related to the mean up crossing rate of wf and lf motion response which is identical to the occurrence frequency of wf and lf motion amplitude is introduced to combine the rayleigh and weibull distribution since the statistical interference effects of wf and lf motion have been considered the hrw model can accurately characterize the wf and lf motion amplitude simultaneously and the short term motion response evaluated from this model can yield an accurate result in addition the hrw model can be applicable to different moored floating structures since no approximation needed to this end the reminder of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the preliminaries of short term motion response prediction are reviewed briefly details of the proposed hrw model are presented in section 3 in section 4 the numerical model and the environmental conditions are introduced and the probability distribution of motion amplitude as well as the short term motion response of a moored semi are evaluated and compared in section 5 finally the conclusions drawn from this work are summarized in section 6 2 preliminaries of short term motion response prediction this section is devoted to reviewing the preliminaries of short term motion response prediction including the gaussian distribution rayleigh distribution and the procedure of short term motion response prediction 2 1 gaussian distribution the short term random wave elevation is usually regarded as a stationary gaussian process with a zero mean and the pdf of the random wave elevation can be fitted by the gaussian distribution which is parameterized in terms of mean value μ and standard deviation σ of the random process the pdf of a gaussian distribution can be given as 1 p x 1 2 π σ e x p x μ 2 2 σ 2 where x is the variable of wave elevation in probability theory and statistics the shape and the asymmetry of a probability distribution is usually characterized by the parameters of kurtosis k and skewness s and they have the following expression 2 k x μ 4 σ 4 e x μ 4 e x μ 2 2 3 s x μ 3 σ 3 e x μ 3 e x μ 2 3 2 where μ 3 and μ 4 are the third and fourth central moments of random process respectively for gaussian process the kurtosis and skewness are identical to 3 0 and 0 0 respectively the process whose kurtosis is not equal to 3 0 or skewness is not identical to 0 0 is referred as a non gaussian process and the deviation level of the non gaussian process from a gaussian law can be revealed by the kurtosis and skewness 2 2 rayleigh distribution generally the pdf of the amplitude associated with a narrow banded gaussian random process follows the rayleigh distribution and its pdf can be expressed as eq 4 bendat and piersol 2000 ross 2000 4 p y y σ 2 e x p y 2 2 σ 2 where y is the amplitude variable σ is the standard deviation of the random process 2 3 weibull distribution the long term distribution of motion response or stress range of the offshore structure is usually assumed to follow the two parameter weibull distribution the pdf of weibull distribution can be given as wang 2010 castellares and lemonte 2015 5 p y a b y b 1 exp a y b where y is the amplitude variable a and b are respectively the scale and shape parameters and they can be determined from the mean value μ and standard deviation value σ of the statistics as expressed in eq 6 6 μ a 1 b γ 1 1 b σ 2 a 2 b γ 1 2 b γ 2 1 1 b 2 4 short term motion response prediction in frequency domain the short term motion response which is usually referred as the 1 n th highest expected motion amplitude can be evaluated from the following formula kato s et al 1990 7 y 1 n y 1 n 100 y p y d y y 1 n 100 p y d y n y 1 n 100 y p y d y where p y is the pdf of motion amplitude y 1 n 100 is the motion amplitude with the exceedance probability of 1 n 100 and it can be determined based on eq 8 8 y 1 n 100 p y d y 1 n 100 if p y is fitted by the rayleigh distribution there exists analytical solution for y 1 n 100 and yields 9 y 1 n 100 2 σ 2 ln n 100 if p y follows other kind of probability distribution y 1 n 100 can be determined numerically the standard deviation σ used to parameterize the pdf of motion amplitude can be determined from the motion response spectrum s x ω and it can be given as 10 σ m 0 0 ω 0 s x ω d ω in time domain the motion amplitude can be firstly extracted from the motion response process via the zero up crossing algorithm and then are sorted in a descending order the 1 n th highest expected motion amplitude y 1 n s is equal to the mean value of the first 1 n th of motion amplitude and yields 11 y 1 n s n n i 1 n n y s i where n is the number of motion amplitude extracted from the motion response process and y s i is the i th motion amplitude in the motion amplitude series 3 the novel hybrid rayleigh and weibull distribution as illustrated in fig 1 one special feature in moored floating structures is the co existence of the first order wf motion and the second order lf resonant response the lf motion response is usually of large amplitude motion with the resonance period in order of minutes the standard deviation of total motion response σ w f l f is much larger than that of wf motion response σ w f due to the existence of lf motion response and the large standard deviation makes the maximum of rayleigh distribution shifting to larger motion amplitude as illustrated in fig 2 the rayleigh distribution parameterized with the standard deviation of wf motion response σ w f seems agree well with the histogram of wf motion amplitude see fig 2 a but it significantly underestimates the probability of lf motion amplitude see fig 2 b however the rayleigh distribution parameterized with the standard deviation of total motion response σ w f l f not only significantly underestimates the probability of wf motion amplitude but also overestimates the probability of lf motion amplitude remarkably see fig 2 b therefore the rayleigh distribution with the standard deviation of wf or total motion response cannot accurately characterize the total motion amplitude of moored floating structures it is known that the rayleigh distribution parameterized with the standard deviation of wf motion response σ w f can fit the wf motion amplitude reasonably see figs 1 b and fig 2 a in addition one finds that the weibull distribution characterized with the standard deviation of lf motion response σ l f can depict the lf motion amplitude accurately see fig 1 d therefore a combination of rayleigh and weibull distribution can be used to describe the total motion amplitude reasonably it should be kept in mind that the wf and lf motion response are not mutually independent kato et al 1990 and the statistical interference effects of wf and lf motion response should be taken into consideration in the combination formula it should be noted that the mean period of lf motion response is much larger than that of wf motion response therefore the occurrence frequency of lf motion amplitude is much smaller than that of wf motion amplitude within a certain duration and hence the probability of lf motion amplitude is much smaller than that of wf motion amplitude as illustrated in fig 2 this indicates that the probability contribution of the wf and lf motion amplitude in total motion amplitude depends on the occurrence frequency of wf and lf motion amplitude generally the occurrence frequency of wf and lf motion amplitude is identical to the mean up crossing frequency of wf and lf motion response therefore the occurrence frequency of wf and lf motion amplitude within a duration t can be given as 12 n w f v 0 w f t 13 n l f v 0 l f t where v 0 w f and v 0 l f are the mean up crossing rate of wf and lf motion response respectively they can be determined based on the spectral moments of motion response and yield 14 v 0 w f 1 2 π m 2 w f m 0 w f 15 v 0 l f 1 2 π m 2 l f m 0 l f where m 0 w f and m 2 w f are the zeroth and second order spectral moments of wf motion response respectively m 0 l f and m 2 l f are the zeroth and second order spectral moments of lf motion response respectively the occurrence frequency of total motion amplitude within a duration t can be obtained by summing the occurrence frequency of wf and lf motion amplitude and it can be given as 16 n l f w f n l f n w f v 0 l f v 0 w f t the probability contribution of wf and lf motion amplitude in total motion amplitude can be characterized by the ratio of occurrence frequency of wf and lf motion amplitude to the occurrence frequency of total motion amplitude and yield 17 r w f v 0 w f v 0 w f v 0 l f 18 r l f v 0 l f v 0 w f v 0 l f where r w f and r l f are the probability contributions of wf and lf motion amplitude in total motion amplitude respectively the statistical interference of wf and lf motion amplitude is closely related to the probability contribution of wf and lf motion amplitude in total motion amplitude and it can be characterized with the occurrence frequency of wf and lf motion amplitude in this paper a weighting factor related to the mean up crossing rate of wf and lf motion response is introduced to consider the statistical interference of wf and lf motion response and it can be given as 19 w v 0 w f v 0 w f v 0 l f then the rayleigh and weibull distribution which are respectively adopted to characterize the wf and lf motion amplitudes can be combined together with the weighting factor to depict the total motion amplitude the combination distribution proposed in this paper is named as hybrid rayleigh and weibull distribution hrw and the pdf of the hrw model has the following formulae 20 p y w y σ w f 2 exp y 2 2 σ w f 2 1 w a b y b 1 exp a y b 21 a 1 2 σ l f 2 b 2 0 where w is the weighting factor which can be determined from the spectral moments of wf and lf motion response directly σ w f and σ l f are the standard deviation of wf and lf motion response respectively a and b are the scale and shape parameters of weibull distribution it should be mentioned that the weighting factor will approach to 1 0 as the lf motion response becomes trivial and the hrw model will turn into the rayleigh distribution in addition the rayleigh and weibull distribution are both continuous probability distribution for nonnegative valued continuous variables the weighting factor adopted to combine the rayleigh and weibull distribution is a constant value for a certain moored floating structure and input sea state there is no break point nor jump point in the pdf of the proposed hrw model for motion amplitude variable y and hence the pdf of the proposed hrw model is a continuous function for the motion amplitude variable y furthermore the cumulative distribution function cdf of the proposed hrw model can be obtained by linearly summing the cdf of rayleigh and weibull distribution and yields 22 f y w 1 exp y 2 2 σ w f 2 1 w 1 exp a y b the cdf of the proposed hrw model is also a continuous function for motion amplitude variable y since the statistical interference effects of wf and lf motion response have been incorporated into the hrw model it is capable of accurately characterizing the wf and lf motion amplitude simultaneously furthermore the hrw model may be applicable to different moored floating structures as no approximation needed 4 numerical model and environmental condition 4 1 numerical model in this study a floating semi coupled with mooring system is demonstrated in the numerical example to fully investigate the validity of the proposed hrw model as illustrated in fig 3 a the semi features four large individual columns and two large pontoons the total length of the semi is 114 07 m and the breadth is 79 m the operation draft of semi is about 18 m and the total displacement is about 52 275 metric tons the main particulars of the semi are summarized in table 1 the semi is assumed to work at sea with depth of 1000 m and positioned with 12 chain wire rope chain lines grouped in four bundles each with three mooring lines the centerlines of the mooring groups are 90 apart and the separation angle between the mooring lines in each bundle is 5 as presented in fig 3 b table 2 provides the main particulars of the mooring lines the coupled dynamic analysis is performed in the commercial software sesam the heading is defined as counter clockwise starting from the positive x axis and the random wave propagates along x axis the simulation duration is 3 h with time step of 0 1 s 4 2 environmental condition to fully investigate the effectiveness of the proposed hrw model three different sea states namely benign moderate and harsh sea state are adopted the wave parameters of these three sea states including the significant wave height h s and the mean up crossing period t z are listed in table 3 in this study the jonswap spectrum is adopted to characterize the energy distribution of input sea state dnvgl 2014 and the energy distributions of these three sea states are presented in fig 4 5 results and discussion the particular concern of mooring system design is the motion response and mooring line tension of the floating system the motion response of a moored semi in surge sway and yaw degree of freedoms dofs is the combination of wf and lf motion response due to the resonance of the system and the motion amplitude in these dofs is much larger than that in heave roll and pitch dofs in addition the semi and mooring system adopted in this study is symmetrical about both the x and y axis and the motion response in surge direction under the head seas is similar to the motion response in sway direction under the beam sea the aim of this study is to investigate the probability distribution of the motion response with bimodal and non gaussian characteristics and the attention is focused on the surge motion response under heading seas in this section the non gaussian characteristics of the motion response processes are firstly investigated and the pdf as well as the exceedance probability of motion amplitude is further estimated and compared finally the 1 10 th and 1 3 th highest expected motion amplitude evaluated from four different kinds of methods are compared and analyzed 5 1 non gaussian characteristics of the motion response processes to fully investigate the non gaussian characteristics of motion response processes the total motion response of the moored semi is decomposed into the wf and lf components via the filter algorithm adopted in the sesam software dnvgl software 2010 in the numerical study the water depth is set to 1000 m and the input sea states are the benign moderate and harsh sea states respectively the pdfs of wf lf and total motion response processes associated with different input sea states are illustrated in fig 5 where fig 5 a c fig 5 d f and fig 5 g i are the pdfs of wf lf and total motion response processes respectively in these figures the blue bars are the histogram estimated from the motion response processes and the solid lines represent the gaussian distribution parameterized with the standard deviation of motion response process it is observed that the pdfs of wl and lf motion response processes show similar characteristics for different input sea states although the wf and lf motion amplitude increases significantly as the input sea states increases see abscissa axis of fig 5 from fig 5 a c one can find that the pdf of wf motion response process is generally symmetrical about its mean value and the gaussian distribution agrees well with the statistical results when the motion response lies in 3 σ 3 σ however from the subfigure of fig 5 a c one can also find that the gaussian distribution is much smaller than the statistical results in the tail of the pdf different from the pdf of wf motion the pdf of lf motion response process is obviously a skewed distribution and the pdf drops to zero quickly for the negative motion response process while it has a long tail for the positive motion response process the rayleigh distribution which is used to depict the amplitude s probability distribution with symmetrical characteristic will underestimate the probability of valleys of lf motion response significantly while it will overestimate the probability of peaks of lf motion response remarkably the kurtosis and skewness of the wf motion response processes under the benign moderate and harsh sea states are 3 723 3 767 3 492 and 0 105 0 100 0 007 respectively while the kurtosis and skewness of the lf motion response processes associated with the benign moderate and harsh sea states are 5 013 4 429 4 431 and 1 151 1 005 1 076 respectively referring to eqs 2 and 3 the wf motion response can be regarded as a weak non gaussian process while the lf motion response can be referred as a strong non gaussian process in such case the total motion response which is the summation of wf and lf motion response is also a non gaussian process the kurtosis and skewness of the total motion response under benign moderate and harsh sea states are 4 971 4 394 3 782 and 1 134 0 990 0 706 which is slightly smaller than that of lf motion response but much larger than that of wf motion response furthermore another noteworthy observation is that the pdf of total motion response process under harsh sea state is closer to the gaussian distribution compared to the results associated with benign and moderate sea states which is different from the conventional cognition it should be noted that the contribution ratio of wf motion response to total motion response varies with the input sea states the standard deviation of the total and lf motion response associated with benign moderate and harsh sea states are 0 790 m 2 560 m 5 417 m and 0 087 m 0 229 m and 2 599 m respectively using the parameter γ m 0 w f m 0 w f l f m 0 w f and m 0 w f l f are the zeroth order spectral moments of wf and total motion response and they are identical to the square of corresponding standard deviation to quantify the contribution of wf motion response to total motion response the parameter γ associated with benign moderate and harsh sea state are identical to 0 012 0 014 and 0 230 respectively therefore the contribution of wf motion response to total motion response under the harsh sea state is much larger than that associated with benign and moderate sea states in addition the pdf of wf motion response can be approximately estimated by gaussian distribution reasonably and hence the pdf of total motion response under harsh sea state is closer to the gaussian distribution 5 2 probability distribution of the motion amplitude the short term motion response of a moored semi can be evaluated from the pdf and exceedance probability of motion amplitude due to the existence of lf motion response the rayleigh distribution which is usually adopted to depict the wf motion amplitude cannot accurately characterize the total motion amplitude to fully investigate the pdf of total motion amplitude and also to validate the effectiveness of the proposed hrw model the moored semi is assumed to work at sea with water depth of 1000 m and the dynamic analysis of the moored semi under benign moderate and harsh sea states are conducted the power spectrum density psd of floater s wf and lf motion response for different input sea states is presented in fig 6 to quantify the bandwidth of psd the bandwidth parameters λ w f m 0 w f m 2 w f m 1 w f 2 1 and λ l f m 0 l f m 2 l f m 1 l f 2 1 of wf and lf motion response recommended by longuet higgins 1957 are evaluated and provided in the figure according to the results of longuet higgins s research the spectrum with bandwidth parameter smaller than 0 5 can be referred as the narrow banded spectrum from the figure one can find that the bandwidth parameters of floater s wf and lf motion response psd under different input sea states are all less than 0 5 and hence the wf and lf motion response of the floater can be regarded as the narrow banded response processes the pdfs of total motion amplitude associated with different input sea states are summarized in fig 7 for clearly illustrating the discrepancies of probability distribution represented by the pdfs and the statistical results the up panels of the figures are presented with linear coordinate see fig 7 a c while the low panels of the figures are presented with logarithmic coordinate see fig 7 d f it should be mentioned that the value in the figure represented by the linear and logarithmic coordinate is identical there are four features worthy of attention in this figure first the motion amplitude increases significantly as the input sea state increases see the abscissa axis of fig 7 this indicates that the input sea state has significant influence on the motion amplitude second the probability of small motion amplitude which mainly comes from wf motion response is much larger than that of large motion amplitude which mainly contributed from lf motion response and the pdf of total motion amplitude has a long tail as illustrated in fig 7 a c the reason is that the probability contribution of wf and lf motion amplitude in total motion amplitude depends on the occurrence frequency of wf and lf motion amplitude generally the mean period of wf motion response is about 5s 20s while the mean period of lf motion response is usually larger than 60s for a simulation duration t the occurrence frequency of wf motion amplitude is much larger than that of lf motion amplitude and hence the probability of small motion amplitude is much larger than that of large motion amplitude third the rayleigh and weibull distribution show poor agreement with the statistical results and both of them underestimate the probabilities of small motion amplitude and overestimate the probabilities of large motion amplitude significantly this is because the rayleigh distribution which can fit the wf motion amplitude reasonably is parameterized in terms of the standard deviation of motion response and it will reach to its maximum when the amplitude variable is identical to the standard deviation the standard deviation of total motion response is much larger than that of wf motion response due to the resonant response of lf motion and the large standard deviation makes the maximum of rayleigh distribution shifting to larger motion amplitude see fig 2 therefore the probability of small motion amplitude which mainly comes from wf motion response is significantly underestimated by rayleigh distribution in addition the probability of large motion amplitude contributed from lf motion response is very small due to the large resonance period of lf motion response and the probability of large motion amplitude will be overestimated by rayleigh distribution since the rayleigh distribution is a special form of weibull distribution the weibull distribution has the similar variation trend with the rayleigh distribution it should be mentioned that the small motion amplitude is closely related to the fatigue damage of mooring line and underestimation the probability of small motion amplitude may result in a non conservative fatigue assessment while the large motion amplitude is directly related to the extreme motion response and the overestimation the probability of large motion amplitude may lead to the conservative extreme motion prediction the most important feature is that the proposed hrw model is in reasonable agreement with the statistical results this indicates that the rayleigh distribution characterized with standard deviation of wf motion response σ w f can accurately depict the wf motion amplitude and the weibull distribution characterized with the standard deviation of lf motion response σ l f can approximately describe the lf motion amplitude although some discrepancies between the proposed hrw model and the statistical results have been observed the proposed hrw model yields the most accurate and slightly conservative prediction of the probability of total motion amplitude among these three pdfs in contrast with the single rayleigh and weibull distributions the proposed hrw model can accurately characterize the probability of wf and lf motion amplitude simultaneously furthermore the proposed hrw model can remain considerable accuracy for different input sea states this indicates that the proposed hrw model is robust to the input sea states and it may be applicable to different moored floating structures 5 3 exceedance probability of the motion amplitude to predict the short term motion response the exceedance probability distribution of motion amplitude is required lim et al 2017 the exceedance probability of motion amplitude is the probability of motion amplitude exceeding a certain level and it can be evaluated based on the pdf of motion amplitude in this study the exceedance probability of motion amplitude associated with benign moderate and harsh sea states are analyzed and the results are illustrated in fig 8 similar to fig 7 the up panels of the figures are presented with linear ordinate see fig 8 a c and the low panels of the figures are presented with logarithmic ordinate see fig 8 e f the value in the figure represented by the linear and logarithmic coordinate is identical from fig 8 one can find that the exceedance probabilities of motion amplitude show similar characteristics for benign and moderate sea states but it shows different characteristics for harsh sea state it is observed that the tail of exceedance probability of motion amplitude under harsh sea state is much shorter than that associated with benign and moderate sea states from section 5 1 one can find that the contribution of lf motion response to total motion response under harsh sea state is much smaller than that under benign and moderate sea states therefore the probability of large motion amplitude contributed from lf motion response becomes smaller and hence the tail of exceedance probability becomes shorter in addition the exceedance probability associated with rayleigh and weibull distribution show poor agreement with the statistical results for a specific exceedance probability level the motion amplitude determined from weibull distribution is much larger than that resulted from rayleigh distribution and they are both larger than the statistical results it is noteworthy that the exceedance probability of motion amplitude associated with the proposed hrw model is almost identical to the statistical results and this is despite the discrepancies observed between the probability of motion amplitude resulted from hrw model and the statistical results one can deduce that the short term motion response evaluated based on the proposed hrw model may be very close to the real ones 5 4 short term motion response prediction to further validate the effectiveness of the proposed hrw model the short term motion responses including the 1 10 th and 1 3 th highest expected motion amplitude are evaluated and compared in this study there are four different methods adopted to estimate the short term motion response the first one is the method adopted in sesam software in this method motion response spectrum used to determine the parameter of motion amplitude s pdf is obtained based on the motion transfer function mtf together with the input wave spectrum and the short term motion response is evaluated based on the rayleigh distribution this method is referred as mtf based method in this study it should be mentioned that the motion response spectrum obtained based on mtf and wave spectrum cannot capture the resonance and nonlinearity characteristics of the floating system and short term motion response determined from this method may deviate from the real ones significantly the second and third methods are the rayleigh distribution based method and the hrw model based method in these methods the motion response spectrum is obtained from motion response process directly and the short term motion responses are evaluated based on the rayleigh distribution and the hrw model respectively the fourth method is the time domain method where the short term motion response is directly evaluated from motion response process according to eq 11 and the results determined from this method is referred as statistical results in this study the short term motion responses evaluated from the mtf based method rayleigh distribution based method and hrw model based method are referred as the predicted results to clearly illustrate the discrepancies of short term motion response between the predicted and statistical results the predicted results are normalized to the statistical results and the percentage deviation of predicted and statistical results are also given d i f f y 1 n p y 1 n s y 1 n s 100 y 1 n p and y 1 n s are prediction and statistical results respectively it is worth noting that the prediction method will overestimate the short term motion response if the percentage deviation is larger than zero while the prediction method will underestimate the short term motion response if the percentage deviation is smaller than zero the 1 10 th and 1 3 th highest expected motion amplitude of the moored semi and the percentage deviation are illustrated in fig 9 in the figure the predicted results are represented by the bars with different colors while the statistical results are denoted by the dash lines from the figure one can find that the 1 10 th and 1 3 th highest expected motion amplitudes evaluated from these four methods show similar characteristics for different input sea states for the 1 10 th highest expected motion amplitudes case the motion amplitudes evaluated from mtf based method is much smaller than the statistical results which is determined from the motion response processes directly the reason is that the mtf based method uses the mtf and input wave spectrum to characterize the motion response spectrum which cannot capture the resonance characteristics of the system and the standard deviation determined from the motion response spectrum is much smaller than the real one in addition the mtf based method utilized rayleigh distribution to depict total motion amplitude the probability of large motion amplitude is underestimated significantly compared with the statistical results see fig 2 and hence the 1 10 th highest expected motion amplitudes which is closely related to the probability of large motion amplitude is significantly underestimated the underestimation level can reach to 75 for benign and moderate sea states and it reduces to 17 for harsh sea state on the contrary the motion amplitudes determined from rayleigh distribution based method is much larger than the statistical results this is because the rayleigh distribution parameterized with the standard deviation of total motion response assigns smaller probability to small motion amplitude and assigns larger probability to large motion amplitude see fig 7 so the 1 10 th highest expected motion amplitudes which is closely related to probability of large motion amplitude will be overestimated significantly the overestimation level is about 140 and 110 for benign and moderate sea states and it reduces to 79 for harsh sea state in addition it should be noted that the percentage deviation of mtf based method and rayleigh distribution based method are both decreases as the input sea states increases the reason is that the contribution of wf motion response to total motion response increases as the input sea state increases and the pdf of total motion amplitude is closer to the rayleigh distribution therefore the 1 10 th highest expected motion amplitudes evaluated based on rayleigh distribution is closer to the statistical results in contrast with the results of mtf based method and rayleigh distribution based method motion amplitudes evaluated based on the proposed hrw model is very closer to but slightly larger than the statistical results the largest difference percentage between the predicted results and the statistics results is not larger than 7 for all the studied cases this indicates that the proposed hrw model is not only accurate but also has robustness to input sea states it should be mentioned that the statistical results determined from the motion response process contains uncertainty due to the limited simulation duration and some large amplitude motion may not occur in the limited simulation duration see the histogram of motion amplitude presented in fig 7 therefore the difference deviation of the predicted results and the statistical results will become smaller after considering the statistical uncertainly associated with simulation length for the 1 3 th highest expected motion amplitude case the mtf based method significantly underestimates the motion amplitude compared to the statistical results and the underestimation level decreases as the input sea state increases while the rayleigh distribution based method overestimates the motion amplitude remarkably and the largest percentage deviation of predicted results and statistical result is about 343 one can also find that the proposed hrw model can yield significantly accurate but slightly conservative predicted results and the largest overestimation level is not larger than 10 for all the studied cases after a careful comparison between 1 10 th and 1 3 th highest expected motion amplitudes one can find that the percentage deviation of the 1 3 th highest expected motion amplitude between statistical results and the predicted results evaluated from mtf based method is about 20 smaller than that of the 1 10 th highest expected motion amplitude while the percentage deviation of the 1 3 th highest expected motion amplitude between the statistical results and the predicted results estimated from rayleigh distribution based method is about 200 larger than that associated with the 1 10 th highest expected motion amplitude however the percentage deviation of 1 3 st highest expected motion amplitude between the statistical results and the predicted results evaluated from the proposed hrw model is very close to that associated with the 1 10 th highest expected motion amplitude this means that the proposed hrw model can maintain its accuracy for short term motion response prediction with different exceedance probability referring to the comparison results one can find that the proposed hrw model can accurately characterize the wf and lf motion amplitude simultaneously and it yields accurate and slightly conservative short term motion response prediction in addition the proposed hrw model has robustness under severe sea states it may be a powerful tool in the preliminary design of mooring system 6 conclusions in this paper a novel pdf named as hybrid rayleigh and weibull distribution hrw is proposed to accurately characterize the probability distribution of motion amplitude which can be used to improve the short term motion response prediction of moored floating structures the proposed hrw model utilizes the rayleigh distribution to depict the wf motion amplitude while employs the two parameter weibull distribution to approximate the lf motion amplitude a key feature of the proposed hrw model is that a weighting factor related to the mean up crossing rate of wf and lf motion response is introduced to weight the probability contribution of wf and lf motion amplitude in total motion amplitude in contrast with the widely used pdfs the proposed hrw model can consider the statistical interference effects of wf and lf motion response and it is capable of characterizing the wf and lf motion amplitude simultaneously the effectiveness of the proposed hrw model has been numerically verified via a semi coupled with mooring system according to the study of this paper some conclusion can be drawn as follows 1 both the rayleigh and weibull distribution underestimate the probability of small motion amplitude significantly and overestimate the probability of large motion amplitude remarkably the short term motion response evaluated from the rayleigh distribution based method is much larger than the statistical results 2 the proposed hrw model is in reasonable agreement with the histogram of motion amplitude and it can yield accurate and slightly conservative short term motion response prediction in addition the proposed hrw model is robust to input sea states and it can be a powerful tool for mooring system design in preliminary design stage acknowledgements the authors acknowledge the support by the national science fund for distinguished

22795,nonlinearities inherent in the dynamic system lead the motion response of moored floating structure to be non gaussian processes and the short term motion response prediction based on rayleigh distribution therefore becomes inaccurate this paper proposes a probability density function pdf termed as the hybrid rayleigh and weibull distribution hrw to accurately characterize the probability distribution of motion amplitude of moored floating structures in the hrw model the rayleigh distribution is adopted to depict wave frequency wf motion amplitude and the weibull distribution is employed to describe low frequency lf motion amplitude since the probability contribution of wf and lf motion amplitude in total motion amplitude depends on the occurrence frequency of wf and lf motion amplitude a weighting factor related to the mean up crossing rate of wf and lf motion response is introduced in the hrw model to combine the rayleigh and weibull distribution the proposed hrw model can consider the statistical interference effects of wf and lf motion and has an advantage of characterizing wf and lf motion amplitude simultaneously to verify the effectiveness of the proposed hrw model a case study for a moored semi submersible was conducted numerical calculation results indicate that the proposed hrw model not only yields accurate short term motion response prediction but also has robustness under severe sea states keywords moored floating structure probability distribution rayleigh distribution weibull distribution short term response prediction 1 introduction the motion response and mooring line tension are important parameters for floating structure mooring system design liu and bergdahl 1999 however due to the existence of second order nonlinear wave force and coupling effect between floating vessel and the mooring system the prediction of integrated motion response of the floating structure has to consider responses in two distinct frequency regimes namely wave frequency wf and low frequency lf at the system resonances naess 1989 low 2010 since the second order wave force is a non gaussian process and the floating structure coupled with mooring system is also a nonlinear system the wf and lf motion response are both non gaussian processes chang et al 2017 lim and kim 2018 and this calls for nonstandard methods to accurately predict the short term motion response of moored floating structures to estimate the short term motion response of a moored floating structure there are two kinds of approaches available namely the time domain method and the frequency domain method low 2010 in the time domain method the wf and lf motion responses can be simulated simultaneously and the influence of system s nonlinearity and non gaussian excitation on motion response can be taken into consideration adequately via the coupled dynamic analysis song and wang 2019 the short term motion response which is referred as 1 n th highest expected motion amplitude can be evaluated from the motion response series in a straight forward manner kato et al 1990 the motion responses obtained from the time domain method is more accurate than those of frequency domain nevertheless the time domain dynamic analysis requires high computational cost not only because the short term variability contributed from random waves asking for multiple realizations to acquire statistical convergence low and huang 2017 but also for the simulation duration should last long enough to acquire sufficient information concerning the extreme statistics low 2010 especially for the long term response prediction a large number of short term sea states involves into the coupled dynamic analysis to get the rigorous results and hence the computational burden increases significantly to reduce the computational effort of time domain method naess et al 2007 proposed an extrapolation method based on the monto carlo simulation to curtail the requisite quantity of simulation data sagrilo et al 2011 further developed a straight forward approach which can take the statistical uncertainly associated with the simulation length into consideration to determine the short term motion response based on a single time series recently low and huang 2017 presented an efficient method to estimate the long term motion response via time domain simulation in which a subset simulation was adopted to tackle the short term variability and the important sampling technology was used to suppress the sampling variability arising from long term uncertainty although several methods have been developed to improve the efficiency of time domain method the time domain method is still very time consuming for the frequency domain method the motion response process is considered as a stationary and ergodic random process and the probability distribution of the motion amplitude can be fitted by a specific pdf the short term motion response can be easily estimated from the pdf of motion amplitude it is known that the probability distribution of the amplitude associated with a narrow banded gaussian random process follows rayleigh distribution bendat and piersol 2000 ross 2000 however due to the existence of second order wave force and mooring system the motion response of a moored floating structure is a non gaussian process low and langley 2008 and the short term motion response determined from rayleigh distribution therefore becomes inaccurate and conservative park et al 2014 kato et al 1990 pointed out that the probability distribution of wf motion amplitude can be approximated by the rayleigh distribution while the probability distribution of lf motion amplitude can be represented by the generalized laguerre polynomials of which the first term was gamma function with three parameters the short term motion response can be estimated separately from the rayleigh distribution and laguerre polynomials in prior and then further be combined together with an empirical rule as the design code suggested by ship classification societies api 2005 dnvgl 2008 furthermore it should be mentioned that the peaks and valleys of wf and lf motion response almost do not occur simultaneously and a linear combination of the wf and lf motion response is too conservative grime and langley 2008 to combine the wf and lf motion response reasonably naess 1989 proposed a modified square root of sum of squares srss combination formula which can consider the correlation between wf and lf motion response to estimate the short term motion response but the correlation factor of the srss formula was quite difficult to determine naess 1994 utilized the tail behavior of motion response s pdfs to obtain the correlation factor with and without considering the interference of wf and lf motion response and kinoshit and takase 1995 employed the experimental results to determine the correlation factor actually the wf and lf motion response are not mutually independent and the short term motion response estimated from the combination formulae may deviate from the real ones the short term motion response is recommended to be evaluated based on the pdf of total motion amplitude directly to get more accurate results however there appears to be fewer studies on the pdf of total motion amplitude naess et al 2007 investigated the statistics of total motion responses based on a nonlinear motion equation but this subject is still unsolved owing to its complex nonlinearities it has been confirmed that the frequency domain method is a powerful tool to predict the short term motion response but there is not yet a pdf that can accurately depict the probability distribution of total motion amplitude of a moored floating structure the primary objective of this paper is to develop a new pdf model to accurately characterize the total motion amplitude which can improve the short term motion response prediction of moored floating structures the newly developed pdf model named the hybrid rayleigh and weibull distribution hrw is a combination way of the rayleigh and weibull distribution in the new hrw model the rayleigh distribution is utilized to depict wf motion amplitude while the two parameter weibull distribution is employed to represent lf motion amplitude because the probability distribution of wf and lf motion amplitude in total motion amplitude depends on the occurrence frequency of wf and lf motion amplitude a weighting factor related to the mean up crossing rate of wf and lf motion response which is identical to the occurrence frequency of wf and lf motion amplitude is introduced to combine the rayleigh and weibull distribution since the statistical interference effects of wf and lf motion have been considered the hrw model can accurately characterize the wf and lf motion amplitude simultaneously and the short term motion response evaluated from this model can yield an accurate result in addition the hrw model can be applicable to different moored floating structures since no approximation needed to this end the reminder of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the preliminaries of short term motion response prediction are reviewed briefly details of the proposed hrw model are presented in section 3 in section 4 the numerical model and the environmental conditions are introduced and the probability distribution of motion amplitude as well as the short term motion response of a moored semi are evaluated and compared in section 5 finally the conclusions drawn from this work are summarized in section 6 2 preliminaries of short term motion response prediction this section is devoted to reviewing the preliminaries of short term motion response prediction including the gaussian distribution rayleigh distribution and the procedure of short term motion response prediction 2 1 gaussian distribution the short term random wave elevation is usually regarded as a stationary gaussian process with a zero mean and the pdf of the random wave elevation can be fitted by the gaussian distribution which is parameterized in terms of mean value μ and standard deviation σ of the random process the pdf of a gaussian distribution can be given as 1 p x 1 2 π σ e x p x μ 2 2 σ 2 where x is the variable of wave elevation in probability theory and statistics the shape and the asymmetry of a probability distribution is usually characterized by the parameters of kurtosis k and skewness s and they have the following expression 2 k x μ 4 σ 4 e x μ 4 e x μ 2 2 3 s x μ 3 σ 3 e x μ 3 e x μ 2 3 2 where μ 3 and μ 4 are the third and fourth central moments of random process respectively for gaussian process the kurtosis and skewness are identical to 3 0 and 0 0 respectively the process whose kurtosis is not equal to 3 0 or skewness is not identical to 0 0 is referred as a non gaussian process and the deviation level of the non gaussian process from a gaussian law can be revealed by the kurtosis and skewness 2 2 rayleigh distribution generally the pdf of the amplitude associated with a narrow banded gaussian random process follows the rayleigh distribution and its pdf can be expressed as eq 4 bendat and piersol 2000 ross 2000 4 p y y σ 2 e x p y 2 2 σ 2 where y is the amplitude variable σ is the standard deviation of the random process 2 3 weibull distribution the long term distribution of motion response or stress range of the offshore structure is usually assumed to follow the two parameter weibull distribution the pdf of weibull distribution can be given as wang 2010 castellares and lemonte 2015 5 p y a b y b 1 exp a y b where y is the amplitude variable a and b are respectively the scale and shape parameters and they can be determined from the mean value μ and standard deviation value σ of the statistics as expressed in eq 6 6 μ a 1 b γ 1 1 b σ 2 a 2 b γ 1 2 b γ 2 1 1 b 2 4 short term motion response prediction in frequency domain the short term motion response which is usually referred as the 1 n th highest expected motion amplitude can be evaluated from the following formula kato s et al 1990 7 y 1 n y 1 n 100 y p y d y y 1 n 100 p y d y n y 1 n 100 y p y d y where p y is the pdf of motion amplitude y 1 n 100 is the motion amplitude with the exceedance probability of 1 n 100 and it can be determined based on eq 8 8 y 1 n 100 p y d y 1 n 100 if p y is fitted by the rayleigh distribution there exists analytical solution for y 1 n 100 and yields 9 y 1 n 100 2 σ 2 ln n 100 if p y follows other kind of probability distribution y 1 n 100 can be determined numerically the standard deviation σ used to parameterize the pdf of motion amplitude can be determined from the motion response spectrum s x ω and it can be given as 10 σ m 0 0 ω 0 s x ω d ω in time domain the motion amplitude can be firstly extracted from the motion response process via the zero up crossing algorithm and then are sorted in a descending order the 1 n th highest expected motion amplitude y 1 n s is equal to the mean value of the first 1 n th of motion amplitude and yields 11 y 1 n s n n i 1 n n y s i where n is the number of motion amplitude extracted from the motion response process and y s i is the i th motion amplitude in the motion amplitude series 3 the novel hybrid rayleigh and weibull distribution as illustrated in fig 1 one special feature in moored floating structures is the co existence of the first order wf motion and the second order lf resonant response the lf motion response is usually of large amplitude motion with the resonance period in order of minutes the standard deviation of total motion response σ w f l f is much larger than that of wf motion response σ w f due to the existence of lf motion response and the large standard deviation makes the maximum of rayleigh distribution shifting to larger motion amplitude as illustrated in fig 2 the rayleigh distribution parameterized with the standard deviation of wf motion response σ w f seems agree well with the histogram of wf motion amplitude see fig 2 a but it significantly underestimates the probability of lf motion amplitude see fig 2 b however the rayleigh distribution parameterized with the standard deviation of total motion response σ w f l f not only significantly underestimates the probability of wf motion amplitude but also overestimates the probability of lf motion amplitude remarkably see fig 2 b therefore the rayleigh distribution with the standard deviation of wf or total motion response cannot accurately characterize the total motion amplitude of moored floating structures it is known that the rayleigh distribution parameterized with the standard deviation of wf motion response σ w f can fit the wf motion amplitude reasonably see figs 1 b and fig 2 a in addition one finds that the weibull distribution characterized with the standard deviation of lf motion response σ l f can depict the lf motion amplitude accurately see fig 1 d therefore a combination of rayleigh and weibull distribution can be used to describe the total motion amplitude reasonably it should be kept in mind that the wf and lf motion response are not mutually independent kato et al 1990 and the statistical interference effects of wf and lf motion response should be taken into consideration in the combination formula it should be noted that the mean period of lf motion response is much larger than that of wf motion response therefore the occurrence frequency of lf motion amplitude is much smaller than that of wf motion amplitude within a certain duration and hence the probability of lf motion amplitude is much smaller than that of wf motion amplitude as illustrated in fig 2 this indicates that the probability contribution of the wf and lf motion amplitude in total motion amplitude depends on the occurrence frequency of wf and lf motion amplitude generally the occurrence frequency of wf and lf motion amplitude is identical to the mean up crossing frequency of wf and lf motion response therefore the occurrence frequency of wf and lf motion amplitude within a duration t can be given as 12 n w f v 0 w f t 13 n l f v 0 l f t where v 0 w f and v 0 l f are the mean up crossing rate of wf and lf motion response respectively they can be determined based on the spectral moments of motion response and yield 14 v 0 w f 1 2 π m 2 w f m 0 w f 15 v 0 l f 1 2 π m 2 l f m 0 l f where m 0 w f and m 2 w f are the zeroth and second order spectral moments of wf motion response respectively m 0 l f and m 2 l f are the zeroth and second order spectral moments of lf motion response respectively the occurrence frequency of total motion amplitude within a duration t can be obtained by summing the occurrence frequency of wf and lf motion amplitude and it can be given as 16 n l f w f n l f n w f v 0 l f v 0 w f t the probability contribution of wf and lf motion amplitude in total motion amplitude can be characterized by the ratio of occurrence frequency of wf and lf motion amplitude to the occurrence frequency of total motion amplitude and yield 17 r w f v 0 w f v 0 w f v 0 l f 18 r l f v 0 l f v 0 w f v 0 l f where r w f and r l f are the probability contributions of wf and lf motion amplitude in total motion amplitude respectively the statistical interference of wf and lf motion amplitude is closely related to the probability contribution of wf and lf motion amplitude in total motion amplitude and it can be characterized with the occurrence frequency of wf and lf motion amplitude in this paper a weighting factor related to the mean up crossing rate of wf and lf motion response is introduced to consider the statistical interference of wf and lf motion response and it can be given as 19 w v 0 w f v 0 w f v 0 l f then the rayleigh and weibull distribution which are respectively adopted to characterize the wf and lf motion amplitudes can be combined together with the weighting factor to depict the total motion amplitude the combination distribution proposed in this paper is named as hybrid rayleigh and weibull distribution hrw and the pdf of the hrw model has the following formulae 20 p y w y σ w f 2 exp y 2 2 σ w f 2 1 w a b y b 1 exp a y b 21 a 1 2 σ l f 2 b 2 0 where w is the weighting factor which can be determined from the spectral moments of wf and lf motion response directly σ w f and σ l f are the standard deviation of wf and lf motion response respectively a and b are the scale and shape parameters of weibull distribution it should be mentioned that the weighting factor will approach to 1 0 as the lf motion response becomes trivial and the hrw model will turn into the rayleigh distribution in addition the rayleigh and weibull distribution are both continuous probability distribution for nonnegative valued continuous variables the weighting factor adopted to combine the rayleigh and weibull distribution is a constant value for a certain moored floating structure and input sea state there is no break point nor jump point in the pdf of the proposed hrw model for motion amplitude variable y and hence the pdf of the proposed hrw model is a continuous function for the motion amplitude variable y furthermore the cumulative distribution function cdf of the proposed hrw model can be obtained by linearly summing the cdf of rayleigh and weibull distribution and yields 22 f y w 1 exp y 2 2 σ w f 2 1 w 1 exp a y b the cdf of the proposed hrw model is also a continuous function for motion amplitude variable y since the statistical interference effects of wf and lf motion response have been incorporated into the hrw model it is capable of accurately characterizing the wf and lf motion amplitude simultaneously furthermore the hrw model may be applicable to different moored floating structures as no approximation needed 4 numerical model and environmental condition 4 1 numerical model in this study a floating semi coupled with mooring system is demonstrated in the numerical example to fully investigate the validity of the proposed hrw model as illustrated in fig 3 a the semi features four large individual columns and two large pontoons the total length of the semi is 114 07 m and the breadth is 79 m the operation draft of semi is about 18 m and the total displacement is about 52 275 metric tons the main particulars of the semi are summarized in table 1 the semi is assumed to work at sea with depth of 1000 m and positioned with 12 chain wire rope chain lines grouped in four bundles each with three mooring lines the centerlines of the mooring groups are 90 apart and the separation angle between the mooring lines in each bundle is 5 as presented in fig 3 b table 2 provides the main particulars of the mooring lines the coupled dynamic analysis is performed in the commercial software sesam the heading is defined as counter clockwise starting from the positive x axis and the random wave propagates along x axis the simulation duration is 3 h with time step of 0 1 s 4 2 environmental condition to fully investigate the effectiveness of the proposed hrw model three different sea states namely benign moderate and harsh sea state are adopted the wave parameters of these three sea states including the significant wave height h s and the mean up crossing period t z are listed in table 3 in this study the jonswap spectrum is adopted to characterize the energy distribution of input sea state dnvgl 2014 and the energy distributions of these three sea states are presented in fig 4 5 results and discussion the particular concern of mooring system design is the motion response and mooring line tension of the floating system the motion response of a moored semi in surge sway and yaw degree of freedoms dofs is the combination of wf and lf motion response due to the resonance of the system and the motion amplitude in these dofs is much larger than that in heave roll and pitch dofs in addition the semi and mooring system adopted in this study is symmetrical about both the x and y axis and the motion response in surge direction under the head seas is similar to the motion response in sway direction under the beam sea the aim of this study is to investigate the probability distribution of the motion response with bimodal and non gaussian characteristics and the attention is focused on the surge motion response under heading seas in this section the non gaussian characteristics of the motion response processes are firstly investigated and the pdf as well as the exceedance probability of motion amplitude is further estimated and compared finally the 1 10 th and 1 3 th highest expected motion amplitude evaluated from four different kinds of methods are compared and analyzed 5 1 non gaussian characteristics of the motion response processes to fully investigate the non gaussian characteristics of motion response processes the total motion response of the moored semi is decomposed into the wf and lf components via the filter algorithm adopted in the sesam software dnvgl software 2010 in the numerical study the water depth is set to 1000 m and the input sea states are the benign moderate and harsh sea states respectively the pdfs of wf lf and total motion response processes associated with different input sea states are illustrated in fig 5 where fig 5 a c fig 5 d f and fig 5 g i are the pdfs of wf lf and total motion response processes respectively in these figures the blue bars are the histogram estimated from the motion response processes and the solid lines represent the gaussian distribution parameterized with the standard deviation of motion response process it is observed that the pdfs of wl and lf motion response processes show similar characteristics for different input sea states although the wf and lf motion amplitude increases significantly as the input sea states increases see abscissa axis of fig 5 from fig 5 a c one can find that the pdf of wf motion response process is generally symmetrical about its mean value and the gaussian distribution agrees well with the statistical results when the motion response lies in 3 σ 3 σ however from the subfigure of fig 5 a c one can also find that the gaussian distribution is much smaller than the statistical results in the tail of the pdf different from the pdf of wf motion the pdf of lf motion response process is obviously a skewed distribution and the pdf drops to zero quickly for the negative motion response process while it has a long tail for the positive motion response process the rayleigh distribution which is used to depict the amplitude s probability distribution with symmetrical characteristic will underestimate the probability of valleys of lf motion response significantly while it will overestimate the probability of peaks of lf motion response remarkably the kurtosis and skewness of the wf motion response processes under the benign moderate and harsh sea states are 3 723 3 767 3 492 and 0 105 0 100 0 007 respectively while the kurtosis and skewness of the lf motion response processes associated with the benign moderate and harsh sea states are 5 013 4 429 4 431 and 1 151 1 005 1 076 respectively referring to eqs 2 and 3 the wf motion response can be regarded as a weak non gaussian process while the lf motion response can be referred as a strong non gaussian process in such case the total motion response which is the summation of wf and lf motion response is also a non gaussian process the kurtosis and skewness of the total motion response under benign moderate and harsh sea states are 4 971 4 394 3 782 and 1 134 0 990 0 706 which is slightly smaller than that of lf motion response but much larger than that of wf motion response furthermore another noteworthy observation is that the pdf of total motion response process under harsh sea state is closer to the gaussian distribution compared to the results associated with benign and moderate sea states which is different from the conventional cognition it should be noted that the contribution ratio of wf motion response to total motion response varies with the input sea states the standard deviation of the total and lf motion response associated with benign moderate and harsh sea states are 0 790 m 2 560 m 5 417 m and 0 087 m 0 229 m and 2 599 m respectively using the parameter γ m 0 w f m 0 w f l f m 0 w f and m 0 w f l f are the zeroth order spectral moments of wf and total motion response and they are identical to the square of corresponding standard deviation to quantify the contribution of wf motion response to total motion response the parameter γ associated with benign moderate and harsh sea state are identical to 0 012 0 014 and 0 230 respectively therefore the contribution of wf motion response to total motion response under the harsh sea state is much larger than that associated with benign and moderate sea states in addition the pdf of wf motion response can be approximately estimated by gaussian distribution reasonably and hence the pdf of total motion response under harsh sea state is closer to the gaussian distribution 5 2 probability distribution of the motion amplitude the short term motion response of a moored semi can be evaluated from the pdf and exceedance probability of motion amplitude due to the existence of lf motion response the rayleigh distribution which is usually adopted to depict the wf motion amplitude cannot accurately characterize the total motion amplitude to fully investigate the pdf of total motion amplitude and also to validate the effectiveness of the proposed hrw model the moored semi is assumed to work at sea with water depth of 1000 m and the dynamic analysis of the moored semi under benign moderate and harsh sea states are conducted the power spectrum density psd of floater s wf and lf motion response for different input sea states is presented in fig 6 to quantify the bandwidth of psd the bandwidth parameters λ w f m 0 w f m 2 w f m 1 w f 2 1 and λ l f m 0 l f m 2 l f m 1 l f 2 1 of wf and lf motion response recommended by longuet higgins 1957 are evaluated and provided in the figure according to the results of longuet higgins s research the spectrum with bandwidth parameter smaller than 0 5 can be referred as the narrow banded spectrum from the figure one can find that the bandwidth parameters of floater s wf and lf motion response psd under different input sea states are all less than 0 5 and hence the wf and lf motion response of the floater can be regarded as the narrow banded response processes the pdfs of total motion amplitude associated with different input sea states are summarized in fig 7 for clearly illustrating the discrepancies of probability distribution represented by the pdfs and the statistical results the up panels of the figures are presented with linear coordinate see fig 7 a c while the low panels of the figures are presented with logarithmic coordinate see fig 7 d f it should be mentioned that the value in the figure represented by the linear and logarithmic coordinate is identical there are four features worthy of attention in this figure first the motion amplitude increases significantly as the input sea state increases see the abscissa axis of fig 7 this indicates that the input sea state has significant influence on the motion amplitude second the probability of small motion amplitude which mainly comes from wf motion response is much larger than that of large motion amplitude which mainly contributed from lf motion response and the pdf of total motion amplitude has a long tail as illustrated in fig 7 a c the reason is that the probability contribution of wf and lf motion amplitude in total motion amplitude depends on the occurrence frequency of wf and lf motion amplitude generally the mean period of wf motion response is about 5s 20s while the mean period of lf motion response is usually larger than 60s for a simulation duration t the occurrence frequency of wf motion amplitude is much larger than that of lf motion amplitude and hence the probability of small motion amplitude is much larger than that of large motion amplitude third the rayleigh and weibull distribution show poor agreement with the statistical results and both of them underestimate the probabilities of small motion amplitude and overestimate the probabilities of large motion amplitude significantly this is because the rayleigh distribution which can fit the wf motion amplitude reasonably is parameterized in terms of the standard deviation of motion response and it will reach to its maximum when the amplitude variable is identical to the standard deviation the standard deviation of total motion response is much larger than that of wf motion response due to the resonant response of lf motion and the large standard deviation makes the maximum of rayleigh distribution shifting to larger motion amplitude see fig 2 therefore the probability of small motion amplitude which mainly comes from wf motion response is significantly underestimated by rayleigh distribution in addition the probability of large motion amplitude contributed from lf motion response is very small due to the large resonance period of lf motion response and the probability of large motion amplitude will be overestimated by rayleigh distribution since the rayleigh distribution is a special form of weibull distribution the weibull distribution has the similar variation trend with the rayleigh distribution it should be mentioned that the small motion amplitude is closely related to the fatigue damage of mooring line and underestimation the probability of small motion amplitude may result in a non conservative fatigue assessment while the large motion amplitude is directly related to the extreme motion response and the overestimation the probability of large motion amplitude may lead to the conservative extreme motion prediction the most important feature is that the proposed hrw model is in reasonable agreement with the statistical results this indicates that the rayleigh distribution characterized with standard deviation of wf motion response σ w f can accurately depict the wf motion amplitude and the weibull distribution characterized with the standard deviation of lf motion response σ l f can approximately describe the lf motion amplitude although some discrepancies between the proposed hrw model and the statistical results have been observed the proposed hrw model yields the most accurate and slightly conservative prediction of the probability of total motion amplitude among these three pdfs in contrast with the single rayleigh and weibull distributions the proposed hrw model can accurately characterize the probability of wf and lf motion amplitude simultaneously furthermore the proposed hrw model can remain considerable accuracy for different input sea states this indicates that the proposed hrw model is robust to the input sea states and it may be applicable to different moored floating structures 5 3 exceedance probability of the motion amplitude to predict the short term motion response the exceedance probability distribution of motion amplitude is required lim et al 2017 the exceedance probability of motion amplitude is the probability of motion amplitude exceeding a certain level and it can be evaluated based on the pdf of motion amplitude in this study the exceedance probability of motion amplitude associated with benign moderate and harsh sea states are analyzed and the results are illustrated in fig 8 similar to fig 7 the up panels of the figures are presented with linear ordinate see fig 8 a c and the low panels of the figures are presented with logarithmic ordinate see fig 8 e f the value in the figure represented by the linear and logarithmic coordinate is identical from fig 8 one can find that the exceedance probabilities of motion amplitude show similar characteristics for benign and moderate sea states but it shows different characteristics for harsh sea state it is observed that the tail of exceedance probability of motion amplitude under harsh sea state is much shorter than that associated with benign and moderate sea states from section 5 1 one can find that the contribution of lf motion response to total motion response under harsh sea state is much smaller than that under benign and moderate sea states therefore the probability of large motion amplitude contributed from lf motion response becomes smaller and hence the tail of exceedance probability becomes shorter in addition the exceedance probability associated with rayleigh and weibull distribution show poor agreement with the statistical results for a specific exceedance probability level the motion amplitude determined from weibull distribution is much larger than that resulted from rayleigh distribution and they are both larger than the statistical results it is noteworthy that the exceedance probability of motion amplitude associated with the proposed hrw model is almost identical to the statistical results and this is despite the discrepancies observed between the probability of motion amplitude resulted from hrw model and the statistical results one can deduce that the short term motion response evaluated based on the proposed hrw model may be very close to the real ones 5 4 short term motion response prediction to further validate the effectiveness of the proposed hrw model the short term motion responses including the 1 10 th and 1 3 th highest expected motion amplitude are evaluated and compared in this study there are four different methods adopted to estimate the short term motion response the first one is the method adopted in sesam software in this method motion response spectrum used to determine the parameter of motion amplitude s pdf is obtained based on the motion transfer function mtf together with the input wave spectrum and the short term motion response is evaluated based on the rayleigh distribution this method is referred as mtf based method in this study it should be mentioned that the motion response spectrum obtained based on mtf and wave spectrum cannot capture the resonance and nonlinearity characteristics of the floating system and short term motion response determined from this method may deviate from the real ones significantly the second and third methods are the rayleigh distribution based method and the hrw model based method in these methods the motion response spectrum is obtained from motion response process directly and the short term motion responses are evaluated based on the rayleigh distribution and the hrw model respectively the fourth method is the time domain method where the short term motion response is directly evaluated from motion response process according to eq 11 and the results determined from this method is referred as statistical results in this study the short term motion responses evaluated from the mtf based method rayleigh distribution based method and hrw model based method are referred as the predicted results to clearly illustrate the discrepancies of short term motion response between the predicted and statistical results the predicted results are normalized to the statistical results and the percentage deviation of predicted and statistical results are also given d i f f y 1 n p y 1 n s y 1 n s 100 y 1 n p and y 1 n s are prediction and statistical results respectively it is worth noting that the prediction method will overestimate the short term motion response if the percentage deviation is larger than zero while the prediction method will underestimate the short term motion response if the percentage deviation is smaller than zero the 1 10 th and 1 3 th highest expected motion amplitude of the moored semi and the percentage deviation are illustrated in fig 9 in the figure the predicted results are represented by the bars with different colors while the statistical results are denoted by the dash lines from the figure one can find that the 1 10 th and 1 3 th highest expected motion amplitudes evaluated from these four methods show similar characteristics for different input sea states for the 1 10 th highest expected motion amplitudes case the motion amplitudes evaluated from mtf based method is much smaller than the statistical results which is determined from the motion response processes directly the reason is that the mtf based method uses the mtf and input wave spectrum to characterize the motion response spectrum which cannot capture the resonance characteristics of the system and the standard deviation determined from the motion response spectrum is much smaller than the real one in addition the mtf based method utilized rayleigh distribution to depict total motion amplitude the probability of large motion amplitude is underestimated significantly compared with the statistical results see fig 2 and hence the 1 10 th highest expected motion amplitudes which is closely related to the probability of large motion amplitude is significantly underestimated the underestimation level can reach to 75 for benign and moderate sea states and it reduces to 17 for harsh sea state on the contrary the motion amplitudes determined from rayleigh distribution based method is much larger than the statistical results this is because the rayleigh distribution parameterized with the standard deviation of total motion response assigns smaller probability to small motion amplitude and assigns larger probability to large motion amplitude see fig 7 so the 1 10 th highest expected motion amplitudes which is closely related to probability of large motion amplitude will be overestimated significantly the overestimation level is about 140 and 110 for benign and moderate sea states and it reduces to 79 for harsh sea state in addition it should be noted that the percentage deviation of mtf based method and rayleigh distribution based method are both decreases as the input sea states increases the reason is that the contribution of wf motion response to total motion response increases as the input sea state increases and the pdf of total motion amplitude is closer to the rayleigh distribution therefore the 1 10 th highest expected motion amplitudes evaluated based on rayleigh distribution is closer to the statistical results in contrast with the results of mtf based method and rayleigh distribution based method motion amplitudes evaluated based on the proposed hrw model is very closer to but slightly larger than the statistical results the largest difference percentage between the predicted results and the statistics results is not larger than 7 for all the studied cases this indicates that the proposed hrw model is not only accurate but also has robustness to input sea states it should be mentioned that the statistical results determined from the motion response process contains uncertainty due to the limited simulation duration and some large amplitude motion may not occur in the limited simulation duration see the histogram of motion amplitude presented in fig 7 therefore the difference deviation of the predicted results and the statistical results will become smaller after considering the statistical uncertainly associated with simulation length for the 1 3 th highest expected motion amplitude case the mtf based method significantly underestimates the motion amplitude compared to the statistical results and the underestimation level decreases as the input sea state increases while the rayleigh distribution based method overestimates the motion amplitude remarkably and the largest percentage deviation of predicted results and statistical result is about 343 one can also find that the proposed hrw model can yield significantly accurate but slightly conservative predicted results and the largest overestimation level is not larger than 10 for all the studied cases after a careful comparison between 1 10 th and 1 3 th highest expected motion amplitudes one can find that the percentage deviation of the 1 3 th highest expected motion amplitude between statistical results and the predicted results evaluated from mtf based method is about 20 smaller than that of the 1 10 th highest expected motion amplitude while the percentage deviation of the 1 3 th highest expected motion amplitude between the statistical results and the predicted results estimated from rayleigh distribution based method is about 200 larger than that associated with the 1 10 th highest expected motion amplitude however the percentage deviation of 1 3 st highest expected motion amplitude between the statistical results and the predicted results evaluated from the proposed hrw model is very close to that associated with the 1 10 th highest expected motion amplitude this means that the proposed hrw model can maintain its accuracy for short term motion response prediction with different exceedance probability referring to the comparison results one can find that the proposed hrw model can accurately characterize the wf and lf motion amplitude simultaneously and it yields accurate and slightly conservative short term motion response prediction in addition the proposed hrw model has robustness under severe sea states it may be a powerful tool in the preliminary design of mooring system 6 conclusions in this paper a novel pdf named as hybrid rayleigh and weibull distribution hrw is proposed to accurately characterize the probability distribution of motion amplitude which can be used to improve the short term motion response prediction of moored floating structures the proposed hrw model utilizes the rayleigh distribution to depict the wf motion amplitude while employs the two parameter weibull distribution to approximate the lf motion amplitude a key feature of the proposed hrw model is that a weighting factor related to the mean up crossing rate of wf and lf motion response is introduced to weight the probability contribution of wf and lf motion amplitude in total motion amplitude in contrast with the widely used pdfs the proposed hrw model can consider the statistical interference effects of wf and lf motion response and it is capable of characterizing the wf and lf motion amplitude simultaneously the effectiveness of the proposed hrw model has been numerically verified via a semi coupled with mooring system according to the study of this paper some conclusion can be drawn as follows 1 both the rayleigh and weibull distribution underestimate the probability of small motion amplitude significantly and overestimate the probability of large motion amplitude remarkably the short term motion response evaluated from the rayleigh distribution based method is much larger than the statistical results 2 the proposed hrw model is in reasonable agreement with the histogram of motion amplitude and it can yield accurate and slightly conservative short term motion response prediction in addition the proposed hrw model is robust to input sea states and it can be a powerful tool for mooring system design in preliminary design stage acknowledgements the authors acknowledge the support by the national science fund for distinguished

22796,in high flow velocity areas like those suitable for tidal applications turbulence intensity is high and flow variations may have a major impact on tidal turbines behaviour large boils that can be observed at the sea surface are emitted from the sea floor and may interact with the tidal turbines these boils have then to be characterized the reynolds number based on the rugosity height and the mean flow velocity is rather high in this context r e 2 5 10 7 for that purpose experiments are carried out in a flume tank with r e as high as achievable in froude similitude in the tank r e 2 5 10 5 and f r 0 23 in order to study coherent flow structures emitted behind seabed obstacles the obstacle is here a canonical square wall mounted cylinder chosen to be representative of specific in situ bathymetric variations using piv and ldv measurements the flow past the cylinder is investigated using a pod filter large coherent structures are identified and their trajectories are analysed by means of a lamb oseen profile approximation properties of these structures are determined the formation mechanism of such structures is discussed in this paper and their behaviour is characterized it is assumed that vortices periodically shed from the obstacle interact and generate hairpin structures keywords turbulence experimental trials wall mounted cylinder piv ldv pod lamb oseen 1 introduction industrial projects have started to emerge in tidal energy harvesting there is a strong tidal potential in europe and over 25 of the european potential is located in french waters edf 2010 the area of interest is the alderney race that presents currents up to u i n s i t u 5 m s in situ strong velocity variations exist myers and bahaj 2005 such variations are causing a high turbulence rate in the water column some turbulent events can sometimes rise up to the surface and erupt to create a boil turbulence can have a major impact on the tidal turbines behaviour on their production duràn medina et al 2017 and on the structural fatigue mycek et al 2014 before trying to reproduce complex bathymetric structures we chose to introduce the topic by studying elementary obstacles representative of real life condition i e with an aspect ratio a r width height of the magnitude of the mean bathymetry variations encountered between france and alderney surveys performed in this area give access to the bathymetry see fig 1 showing an average depth variation of h i n s i t u 5 m some bathymetry variations have been represented using elementary elements like a wall mounted cube and an inclined floor representing smooth depth variations ikhennicheu et al 2018a the wake past a wall mounted cube has been described and results show that the addition of an inclined floor downstream of the cube impulses turbulent structures higher than the simple floor translation however the floor inclination does not have an impact on the nature of turbulent structures emitted from the obstacle wake the aspect ratio impact on the wake development has been investigated in ikhennicheu et al 2018b showing that for an aspect ratio 7 times superior the recirculation length triples the matter of interest of this work is the development of the wake and the analysis of turbulent structures past large a r obstacles the case of a r is a classical example of a 2d obstacle in the literature among the firsts to ever characterize the flow past a 2d block rib castro 1979 characterized its wake in a flow at r e 1 5 10 4 more recently liu et al 2008 carried out experiments on a rib in a turbulent flow for r e 1 3 10 4 they give a detailed explanation of the intermittency aspect of the reattachment of the recirculation region they also found that at x h 15 75 in the obstacle wake the streamwise velocity is not fully recovered illustrating the wake extension past larger a r obstacles indeed at this location behind a 3d wall mounted cube hearst et al 2016 the wake of the obstacle is fully dissipated finally the experimental works of wang et al 2009 offer a topology of the fluid past a rib at r e 2 2 10 4 detailed investigations on the turbulent organisation past a vertical cylinder can be found in the studies of sattari et al 2012 although different mechanisms are expected for a horizontal cylinder these studies on 2d ribs are completed by numerical works such as the one of panigrahi and acharya 2004 who simulated a turbulent flow at r e 1 4 10 4 on 2d square ribs for obstacles with high a r the two ends of the horseshoe vortex are farther apart and have smaller influence on the middle region of the wake unlike for small a r obstacles where they interact and cause the 3d behaviour of the wake intermediate a r were experimentally studied by martinuzzi and tropea 1993 they found that for a r 6 the recirculation region downstream of the cube switches from a 3d aspect to a nominally 2d aspect the main differences between 2d and 3d square obstacles are extensively described by schofield and logan 1990 few of the studies exposed in this bibliographic review present cases with r e 10 5 it is generally assumed that for r e 4 10 4 the flow achieves a certain reynolds number independency as found by castro and robins 1977 however that conclusion has been questioned in lim et al 2007 where it is explained that for vortex dominated flows the mean flow is likely to be re dependant the reynolds number based on h i n s i t u and u i n s i t u is substantially high r e i n s i t u h i n s i t u u i n s i t u ν 2 5 10 7 with ν the kinematic viscosity of water hence there is a necessity to extend the existing database for marine energy application through high reynolds number experiments few studies are lead on the far field of wide wall mounted obstacles in a high reynolds number flow and especially with a focus on the turbulent structures that are emitted from the wake large turbulent events can have a major impact on turbines mycek et al 2014 hence the need to investigate them in many cases in the literature coherent turbulent structures can be observed past an obstacle or in a turbulent boundary layer one of the most extensive analysis of structures emitted from turbulent boundary layers is the work of adrian et al 2000 they detailed the creation detection and transport of hairpin structures in the flow for wide square plates the numerical study of diabil et al 2017 for r e 6 5 10 3 shows that kelvin helmholtz vortices are shed from the upstream face of the obstacle periodically shed vortices create corotating pairs that lead to vortex pairing as described by the annual review of leweke et al 2016 their analysis uses a lamb oseen model for vortex profile fitting as will be done here müller and gyr 1987 demonstrate that these vortices interact or merge to create hairpin structures these hairpins are sometimes called kolk vortices in other studies best 2005b such structures are very energetic and can rise up to the surface to form a large boil best 2005a volino et al 2009 studied coherent structures created over a rough bottom they show that their size varies with the upstream flow conditions however the rising angle is conserved sabatino and rossmann 2016 proposed tomographic piv measurements of hairpin vortex developing in laminar boundary layers they illustrate how hairpin vortices regenerate with the creation of secondary hairpin vortices this kind of turbulent structures shall be characterized in order to predict their trajectory and frequency as well as the incoming velocity profile on tidal turbines in this paper coherent structures developing from the wake of a wall mounted cylinder representative of seabed element is studied the experimental set up is first presented and test cases are detailed then the characterization of the wake past the cylinder is carried out from experimental results in and out of the symmetry plane vortices are studied and a method to detect their centre and track their position is proposed a lamb oseen vortex approximation is proposed for the determination of the vortex properties a temporal analysis is added to the turbulent structures analysis finally a discussion on the turbulent organisation formed in the obstacle wake is proposed 2 experimental set up the tests are carried out in the wave and current circulating flume tank of ifremer located in boulogne sur mer france presented in fig 2 a the test section is 18 m long 4 m wide 2 m high in this work the three instantaneous velocity components are denoted u v w along the x y z directions respectively fig 2 b each instantaneous velocity component is separated into a mean value and a fluctuating part according to the reynolds decomposition u u u where an overbar indicates the time average the incoming flow u v w is assumed to be steady and constant by means of a grid and a honeycomb that acts as a flow straightener placed at the inlet of the working section see fig 2 b a turbulent intensity of i 1 5 is achieved for a flow velocity of 1 m s turbulence intensity i in the incoming flow is defined as follows 1 i 100 1 3 u 2 v 2 w 2 u 2 v 2 w 2 the wall mounted cylinder is chosen to be representative of real life conditions as there is no obstacle upstream of the cylinder the upstream flow is a simple boundary layer developing over the tank floor hence the experimental set up represents a bump considerably higher than its neighbours to consider turbulent events interaction with the free surface experiments shall be achieved in froude similitude see table 1 where f r u g d with g the gravity and d the tank depth furthermore reynolds number must be as high as achievable to be closer to real conditions the obstacle of interest in this study is a wall mounted cylinder of aspect ratio a r width height 6 represented in fig 3 this element represents a key bathymetric element in the area of interest at a 1 20 scale see table 1 in the following study non dimensional lengths are used for all parameters indexed by x x h y y h z z h and δ δ h with h the cylinder height h 0 25 m at the obstacle position the boundary layer height δ is calculated as δ 95 z u 0 95 u it yields δ 1 3 to characterize the flow two laser velocimetry techniques are used ldv laser doppler velocimetry and piv particle image velocimetry see fig 3 beforehand the tank is seeded with 10 μ m diameter silver coated glass micro particles for the piv measurements a nd yag laser gemini like is used power is 200 m j per probe and wavelength is 532 m m the laser is synchronized with a camera flowsens eo 2m 1600 pix 1200 pix that makes double images with a time step of 1600 μ s a particle is detected on 3 to 5 pixels cross correlation peak intensity is between 0 3 and 0 8 and peak detectability ratio of the tallest correlation peak and the second tallest correlation peak adrian and westerweel 2011 is 8 in average piv acquisitions are made for 150 s hence 2250 double images are taken with a 15 h z acquisition frequency the data are post processed with the software dynamic studio the displacement of particles is calculated using a cross correlation on 32 pix 32 pix interrogation windows with 50 overlap meinhart et al 1993 outliers are replaced with the universal outlier detection westerweel and scarano 2005 depending on the plane from 1 to 13 of the total vectors number are substituted single pass method is used as in our case multi pass adaptive piv leads to errors generating artefacts rather than improving resolution piv measurements are carried out at various transverse positions y 0 y 1 and y 2 denoted y 0 y 1 and y 2 respectively summarized in table 2 and represented in fig 4 b fig 4 a shows the 13 measurement planes carried out for each transverse position in the tank using a wide angle lens for a large surface detection only vertical piv measurement planes can be achieved hence only 2d measurements of u w will be performed in this study the experimental set up allows measurements for z 0 5 7 fig 5 illustrates the post processing steps applied in the plane y 0 from the raw image to the universal outlier detection uod the cross correlation cc results are obtained with a mask applied on the cylinder the ldv measurements are made using a 2d dantec fiberflow system the probe is positioned horizontally for u v measurements at various streamwise positions along the z axis with ldv measurements the acquisition frequency is not constant it depends on the number of particles passing through the measurement volume then a re sampling is done in the post processing based on previous works performed in the tank duràn medina et al 2015 the re sampling is done using the mean sample rate of the measurement set considered at a specific streamwise position f e varies from 70 to 270 h z depending on the turbulent agitation various sources of experimental errors can be identified positions fixed using the human eyes are considered to have a maximum error of 0 5 c m and 0 5 it is the case for the obstacle and the lasers positioning particles motion follows the basset boussinesq oseen equation for silver covered glass particle the response of particle is of 0 14 m m s the laser sheet induces a magnification that causes an error of 0 3 adrian and westerweel 2011 measurements standard deviation goes up to 0 1 calibration is achieved by the ldv manufacturer additionally the vibration of the ldv probe due to vortex induced vibrations can induce an error up to 0 5 c m piv calibration is precise at 1 m m the pixel size is added to the errors for piv measurements hence the errors on the results are of 2 and 2 6 for ldv and piv respectively a comparison is made in fig 6 between piv and ldv measurements in the symmetry plane showing a good coherency 3 characterization of the wake past the wall mounted cylinder average velocity maps of u and w in planes y 0 y 1 and y 2 are presented in fig 7 in these figures the classical behaviour of the flow past a wall mounted element can be observed the flow separates at the leading edges of the cylinder into the outer steady region and the recirculation area downstream of the cylinder a shear layer develops in between and then the flow reattaches the recirculation length downstream of the obstacle is evaluated for the 3 planes l y 0 6 l y 1 5 5 and l y 2 4 5 as expected the apparition of 3d effects mainly impacts planes for y y 1 the l reduction between y 0 and y 1 is 8 and l reduction increases to 18 between y 1 and y 2 in martinuzzi and tropea 1993 at a similar r e and a r a recirculation length of l 5 7 has been measured in the symmetry plane which is close to our results maps of the average vertical velocity w out of the symmetry plane indicate that the flow passing over the obstacle is similar in the 3 planes for x 2 however downstream of the cylinder the flow is considerably redirected towards the floor for position y 2 with a large and intense w 0 zone in y 0 the flow shows an area of w 0 beginning at x 6 from the floor up to z 1 the wake is impulsed towards the surface fig 8 a and b show that in y 0 the transverse component v is relatively unaffected by the cylinder wake the velocity fluctuations at z 2 indicate a large shear stress area for u and w that does not affect v at z 2 for instance values are u u 0 64 0 2 v u 0 003 0 04 and w u 0 05 0 16 in order to better understand the development of the wake past the cylinder average reynolds shear stress τ u w u w maps are plotted in fig 9 some areas suffer from the poor lightning and data in these area are not fully converged however it appears that the shear layer reduces faster for y 1 compared to y 0 although the global orientation is similar in field y 2 the shear layer length reduces by half and is reoriented towards the floor here the shear layer length is estimated as the length corresponding to the position at which τ u w u 2 0 02 this effect is also visible when comparing w maps in fig 7 in x 7 the shear layer starts disappearing for y 2 but persists for the other two planes 4 turbulent structures dynamics during the experiments performed for this study large boils are observed at the tank free surface as illustrated in fig 10 taken 8 m past the obstacle such events originate in the shear layer past the cylinder and rise up to the surface located at 2 m from the bottom these events are highly energetic with a 1 m diameter it is the same kind of vortices that can be observed at the sea surface in the alderney race these events evolving in the water column and carrying high velocity variations might have a strong impact on tidal turbines their investigation is detailed in this section in order to be able to quantify their effect on the flow impacting a potential turbine in this part pod proper orthogonal decomposition is used as a filter on piv measurement results in order to highlight the highest energetic structures and leave aside the non coherent turbulent part then based on the extracted energetic flow structures a centre detection algorithm is implemented on pod filtered data in order to characterize the dynamic of turbulent events present in the flow structures properties are also investigated using a lamb oseen vortex approximation 4 1 pod filter and vortex properties 4 1 1 pod filter pod is an efficient and optimal mathematical tool to extract energetic coherent structures embedded in a turbulent flow it was first introduced by lumley 1967 the snapshot version of pod sirovich 1987 is used in the present work details of the implementation of the pod technique applied to piv database can be found in druault et al 2005 2012 following previous works ikhennicheu et al 2018a a vectorial pod is performed in this study in order to determine the number of pod modes n p o d used to filter the large turbulent structures the effect of pod filter on the fluctuating velocity field is investigated in fig 11 during the passing of a vortex in plane b see fig 4 this specific vortex is selected because its centre position is in the middle of the plane and because there is no other vortex close by in the raw field without filter a vortex appears but its centre is difficult to properly position with n p o d 20 the pod filter is efficient although some turbulent noise is still present and that could hinter the centre detection with n p o d 10 rotating velocity is weaker since it is less energetic hence the required pod modes number lies between 10 and 20 which corresponds to between 69 and 76 of the total kinetic energy level arbitrary it is chosen to take in the following 70 of the total kinetic energy for each measurement plane for plane b it corresponds to 13 modes 4 1 2 vortex properties a centre detection algorithm inspired by the method proposed by graftieaux et al 2001 and adapted for piv measurements by druault et al 2005 is here considered in each point m the tangential fluctuating velocity v θ is evaluated for the 2 8 16 neighbours as represented in fig 12 if every v θ around m has the same sign a vortex centre is detected a sensibility analysis allowed to fix 16 vortices to achieve a good centre detection to have trajectories long enough for statistic analysis this study is restricted to trajectories detected on at least 7 temporally consecutive detected points corresponding to a minimal detection time of 7 δ t 0 47 s the centre detected with the algorithm is indicated with a red dot in fig 13 the full trajectory obtained is represented in fig 14 following previous studies hamed et al 2017 leweke et al 2016 the head of vortices supposed to be hairpin vortices detected in 2d piv planes can be modelled thanks to a simplified lamb oseen vortex model following moriconi 2009 such vortex is defined by equation 2 2 v θ r γ 2 π r 1 e x p r 2 r c 2 with γ the circulation and r the radius r c is the vortex core size see fig 15 b dimensionless values are used r c r c h and γ γ h u only vortices that are in the middle of the plane can be properly fitted since a sufficient quantity of data points is necessary a vortex passing in the middle of plane b is chosen its tangential velocity v θ is plotted with r r h 2 2 and θ 0 i e z constant as illustrated in fig 15 a it is then fitted by a lamb oseen profile in fig 15 b the lamb oseen model is designed for circular symmetrical vortices due to a ratio between the size of the vortex and the height of the measurement plane close to 1 it is not possible to perform a lamb oseen vortex approximation for θ 0 to θ 90 for all vortices to make sure the approximation is valid in every direction it is only possible for some vortices that are located at mid height of the plane fig 16 shows two cases of vortices for which the approximation is performed for θ 0 and θ 90 most of the vortices are symmetrical similar to the one on fig 16 a however some vortices present an elliptical form which results in the non identical profiles presented on fig 16 b more precisions on the specific case of elliptical vortices will be given later in the paper 4 2 analysis of the turbulent structures the algorithm is applied to every piv measurement plane all the trajectories are gathered in fig 17 a for the plane y 0 the top of the shear layer is determined from fig 9 where τ u w 0 02 this figure shows that vortices are generated in the beginning of the shear layer and are then emitted in the flow close to the obstacle first piv planes x 4 it is expected that trajectories detected are kelvin helmholtz vortices higher in the water column and further in the flow detected vortices are expected to resemble hairpin vortices trajectories are also presented in plane y 1 in fig 17 b results are similar to those obtained for y 0 while in y 2 no vortiex is detected it is assumed that the same wide 3d structure is detected on both 2d planes y 0 and y 1 as sections of a larger 3d structure even if vortices detected in one plane are not linked with vortices detected in the contiguous plane the 3d shape of the vortices is then contained in a 2 h 3 h 2 h volume x y z directions the planes a b and c contain the most vortices they are also the most representative of the vortex behaviour since they are located just above the shear layer where turbulent structures are emitted fig 18 illustrates the trajectories detected for planes a b and c on plane a trajectories are impulsed from the shear layer and oriented towards the surface with an angle of 9 all trajectories are localized in the low part of the plane then for planes b and c trajectories appear more horizontal and more scattered they are being dispersed and carried out by the flow it is worth noticing that some trajectories in plane b in bold in fig 18 b are particularly oriented towards the surface it is assumed that these are the trajectories of vortices that might erupt at the surface a linear interpolation is achieved on every trajectory in order to study the rising angle γ of each vortex in average the mean rising angle γ is found between 6 to 10 it is substantially higher than the average rising angle of the shear layer which is around 4 see fig 9 a there is a strong dispersion of γ due to the large range of trajectory angles however the average rising angle reduces when x increases the discrepancy of rising angle results in fig 17 might be caused by 3d effects in the wake or by the unsteady interaction of emitted vortices with one another as explained by müller and gyr 1987 the boil represented in fig 10 corresponds to a rarely occurred event with an angle of 14 which is in the higher range of vortex trajectories this indicates that some trajectories are particularly impulsed towards the surface compared to others the low rising angle trajectories cannot be observed in the present set up since they would erupt downstream of the working section end where the boil picture represented in fig 10 is taken the approximation of the vortex fluctuating tangential velocity with a lamb oseen profile is applied to vortices located in the middle of the measurement plane in order to have enough data points for profile fitting the superposition of fitted profiles for plane c is plotted in fig 19 this shows that the vortex profiles are generally symmetrical about their vertical axis v θ varies between 0 21 0 25 velocity profiles are slightly non symmetrical about their horizontal axis v θ is larger upstream of the vortex centre where its value is positive it is connected to the rising trajectory towards the free surface the radius r c and the circulation γ obtained with the lamb oseen vortex approximation are presented in table 3 for plane y 0 the number of vortices that present enough data points for profile fitting is indicated compared to the total number of trajectories detected in the measurement plane standard deviation is around 25 on r c but higher on γ nevertheless global behaviour can be drawn from these results γ decreases when x increases and r c does not variate significantly vortices that are emitted from the shear layer weaken due to dissipation effect in average vortices have a diameter of 0 30 m h in the symmetry plane in the sense of the lamb oseen vortex approximation however the vortices fluctuations themselves are present as long as v θ 0 and in that perspective the diameter of the vortex velocity perturbations is of the order of 1 m the lamb oseen modelling is also applied to y 1 vortices and averaged results are presented in table 3 results are within the same range as in plane y 0 especially when accounting for the standard deviations the same global behaviour is observed γ reduces when x increases and the radius r c does not variate significantly nevertheless both metrics are inferior to those in the symmetry plane it means that weak 3d effects exist although they cannot be more thoroughly investigated with the available database structures are then larger and more energetic in the symmetry plane it appears to be consistent with hairpin vortices centred around the symmetry plane most of the vortices whose trajectories are described in fig 18 have a low rising angle trajectory γ 5 3 with circular form as shown in fig 20 the rising velocity v v t x v z u is evaluated here at v v t x 0 3 otherwise some of the trajectories are more oriented towards the surface with a higher rising angle on fig 18 b trajectories with the highest rising angle are highlighted it appears that these trajectories present a common behaviour while rising up the vortex shifts from a circular to an elliptical form circulation around it becomes more intense the vortex dynamic of the yellow trajectory in bold in fig 18 b is illustrated in fig 21 for this example the rising velocity is v v t x 0 8 more than 2 times the horizontal case with a rising angle of 16 2 three times superior for the nine selected events rising up averaged results give a radius of 0 64 0 08 and a circulation of 1 7 0 3 in the previous section lamb oseen vortex approximation gave in average r c 0 68 0 2 and γ 1 4 0 4 for all trajectories in plane b these results confirm the previous observations indeed as the vortex becomes elliptical its horizontal radius r c reduces hence high rising angle vortices are more energetic and their shape changes as they extend towards the surface rising up in the water column 4 3 temporal analysis using ldv measurements a spectral analysis is performed in the symmetry plane y 0 acquisitions last 6 min and frequency varies for each streamwise position x the lowest average acquisition frequency for each altitude is taken f e x 7 84 h z and f e x 11 75 h z using f e ldv signals are re sampled signals are then cut into blocks of 1024 points and a fast fourier transform is applied on every block power spectrum densities are then plotted versus the strouhal number s t f h u in fig 22 a and b in the near field altitudes are chosen to represent the flow above under and at the shear layer position three different flow behaviours are detected first below z 3 x 7 for and below z 3 6 for x 11 the energetic content is high since those points are located in the shear layer furthermore a sharp peak is detected for s t 0 062 second there is a transitional part in between where spectrum do not show any peak and third above z 3 4 for x 7 and above z 3 6 for x 11 the energetic content is lower and the peak is detected for a higher frequency of s t 0 072 the higher peak s t 0 072 is close to the literature for dunes cases in omidyeganeh and piomelli 2011 it corresponds to the vortex shedding periodic events indicated by the lower peak s t 0 062 happening underneath the shed vortices in the shear layer do not impact the higher altitudes of the water column therefore every event occurring in the top part of the water column must originate from vortices shed from the shear layer the same result was found by omidyeganeh and piomelli 2011 that carried out les simulation on dunes fig 22 c shows the presence of a peak in the far field close to the surface that measurement point is the only one available for x 11 the peak is around s t 0 072 confirming that the events detected above the shear layer are still present at the same frequency close to the surface and they will presumably erupt at the free surface the peak intensity is lower than the peak close to the obstacle indicating a lower energetic content in fig 23 a map of instantaneous u w obtained from piv measurements for z versus t is plotted for a chosen streamwise position at x 11 a vortex passing is detected with a high u w 0 peak followed by u w 0 with amplitude superior to 0 02 at mid height z 3 periodic vortex passing is observed it matches the frequency found in fig 22 for vortex shedding the constant shedding of vortices is visible until z 3 5 which is the boundary of the shear layer some events are more energetic than others and are still persistent above z 4 at t 40 s for instance these highly turbulent events that rise higher are more energetic than others on figs 23 and 24 two zones are highlighted in red a zone that presents highly turbulent events rising higher than the average turbulent events they are still visible on the signals at z 4 in green a zone where vortices do not show higher than z 3 5 instantaneous u w signals are plotted in fig 24 at the same streamwise position x 11 and for two altitudes z 3 and z 4 for the 150 s of the piv acquisition this figure illustrates what is explained in the previous section at z 3 vortex shedding induces a periodic fluctuating velocity variation it occurs at the frequency detected in the spectrum in fig 22 b at a higher position z 4 although the frequency is still visible on the spectrum it does not show on the signals with the used scale some intense events are detected these are the very energetic events that rise higher than the shear layer and they will be assimilated to hairpin structures in the next section 4 4 discussion on detected vortices looking at previous results there seems to be two kinds of structures coexisting in the cylinder wake the presence of the obstacle in a flow promotes the creation of a shear layer and as in a mixing layer kelvin helmholtz instabilities are generated from the velocity difference between the outer flow and the recirculation region underneath these vortices are detected on the edges of the shear layer close to the obstacle which is consistent with kelvin helmholtz instabilities the shedding frequency is detected in the spectral analysis then as demonstrated in müller and gyr 1987 leweke et al 2016 these events can merge pair up or interact to form hairpin structures it is indeed illustrated by the works of diabil et al 2017 and by chaurasia and thompson 2011 both working on the flow past large plates hairpin structures are then more persistent and energetic with a higher rising angle and they are ejected towards the free surface structures transverse extension is around 2 h 0 5 m and the resulting boils are around 1 m wide it implies that hairpin structures generate boils wider than their width when erupting at the surface best 2005a temporal analysis validates the assumption that these structures are hairpin boil generating vortices created from kelvin helmholtz vortices interactions in the separated shear layer as detailed by müller and gyr 1987 this assumption opposes to hairpin vortices generated underneath the shear layer from near wall bursts or reattachment flapping conjectures kiya and sasaki 1985 kadota and nezu 1999 such explanations are consistent with vortices detected in the piv measurement planes being 2d sections of a larger 3d event furthermore these events are only visible past large a r obstacles indeed in previous works ikhennicheu et al 2018a it is shown that in the case of low a r obstacles such as a wall mounted cube kelvin helmholtz vortices do not form structures able to rise up to the free surface it is also explained by diabil et al 2017 in their numerical study on large and low a r plates 5 conclusion and perspectives in this study the flow past a wide wall mounted square cylinder of aspect ratio a r 6 is studied from piv measurements the wake past the obstacle is characterized key elements of the wake past the obstacle are identified recirculation length in the symmetry plane is l 6 it then reduces by 8 in y 1 and 18 in y 2 average reynolds shear stress maps illustrate the shear layer behaviour its position is very similar between y 0 and y 1 whereas in y 2 it is redirected towards the floor the flow behaviour is similar between y 0 and y 1 and shows significant differences for y 2 with the apparition of side effects at the free surface of the tank 1 m wide boils can be observed these events originate in the cylinder wake and rise up to the surface in order to understand these structures behaviour piv measurements are filtered using proper orthogonal decomposition based on existing methods a centre detection algorithm is applied it allows to elucidate vortices trajectories no vortex is large or energetic enough to be detected in field y 2 authors conclude that the transverse extend of the vortex lies between y 0 and y 1 hence from 2 h to 4 h 0 5 m to 1 m in average the rising angle of vortices is 8 which is higher than the shear layer rising angle of 4 velocity profiles are fitted with a lamb oseen profile showing that the vortices radius stays similar with x r c 0 69 in y 0 however circulation reduces with x it is an effect of vortices dissipation it is then showed that some vortices are impulsed towards the surface they show a stronger circulation a larger rising velocity and their shape shifts from a circular to an elliptical form finally a temporal analysis validates that some events rise higher in the water column than others in the discussion authors suggest that two phenomena coexist kelvin helmholtz instabilities develop downstream of the obstacle in the shear layer close to the obstacle then these events merge pair up or interact to form hairpin structures ejected towards the free surface to form large boils such boils that exist at sea can have a major impact on turbines and must be considered in calculations for loads on tidal turbines the problem investigated here is also under development from a numerical perspective mercier et al 2017 after validation numerical analysis will offer a 3d understanding of the turbulent phenomenon occurring in the cylinder wake acknowledgment this work benefits from a french state grant managed by the national research

22796,in high flow velocity areas like those suitable for tidal applications turbulence intensity is high and flow variations may have a major impact on tidal turbines behaviour large boils that can be observed at the sea surface are emitted from the sea floor and may interact with the tidal turbines these boils have then to be characterized the reynolds number based on the rugosity height and the mean flow velocity is rather high in this context r e 2 5 10 7 for that purpose experiments are carried out in a flume tank with r e as high as achievable in froude similitude in the tank r e 2 5 10 5 and f r 0 23 in order to study coherent flow structures emitted behind seabed obstacles the obstacle is here a canonical square wall mounted cylinder chosen to be representative of specific in situ bathymetric variations using piv and ldv measurements the flow past the cylinder is investigated using a pod filter large coherent structures are identified and their trajectories are analysed by means of a lamb oseen profile approximation properties of these structures are determined the formation mechanism of such structures is discussed in this paper and their behaviour is characterized it is assumed that vortices periodically shed from the obstacle interact and generate hairpin structures keywords turbulence experimental trials wall mounted cylinder piv ldv pod lamb oseen 1 introduction industrial projects have started to emerge in tidal energy harvesting there is a strong tidal potential in europe and over 25 of the european potential is located in french waters edf 2010 the area of interest is the alderney race that presents currents up to u i n s i t u 5 m s in situ strong velocity variations exist myers and bahaj 2005 such variations are causing a high turbulence rate in the water column some turbulent events can sometimes rise up to the surface and erupt to create a boil turbulence can have a major impact on the tidal turbines behaviour on their production duràn medina et al 2017 and on the structural fatigue mycek et al 2014 before trying to reproduce complex bathymetric structures we chose to introduce the topic by studying elementary obstacles representative of real life condition i e with an aspect ratio a r width height of the magnitude of the mean bathymetry variations encountered between france and alderney surveys performed in this area give access to the bathymetry see fig 1 showing an average depth variation of h i n s i t u 5 m some bathymetry variations have been represented using elementary elements like a wall mounted cube and an inclined floor representing smooth depth variations ikhennicheu et al 2018a the wake past a wall mounted cube has been described and results show that the addition of an inclined floor downstream of the cube impulses turbulent structures higher than the simple floor translation however the floor inclination does not have an impact on the nature of turbulent structures emitted from the obstacle wake the aspect ratio impact on the wake development has been investigated in ikhennicheu et al 2018b showing that for an aspect ratio 7 times superior the recirculation length triples the matter of interest of this work is the development of the wake and the analysis of turbulent structures past large a r obstacles the case of a r is a classical example of a 2d obstacle in the literature among the firsts to ever characterize the flow past a 2d block rib castro 1979 characterized its wake in a flow at r e 1 5 10 4 more recently liu et al 2008 carried out experiments on a rib in a turbulent flow for r e 1 3 10 4 they give a detailed explanation of the intermittency aspect of the reattachment of the recirculation region they also found that at x h 15 75 in the obstacle wake the streamwise velocity is not fully recovered illustrating the wake extension past larger a r obstacles indeed at this location behind a 3d wall mounted cube hearst et al 2016 the wake of the obstacle is fully dissipated finally the experimental works of wang et al 2009 offer a topology of the fluid past a rib at r e 2 2 10 4 detailed investigations on the turbulent organisation past a vertical cylinder can be found in the studies of sattari et al 2012 although different mechanisms are expected for a horizontal cylinder these studies on 2d ribs are completed by numerical works such as the one of panigrahi and acharya 2004 who simulated a turbulent flow at r e 1 4 10 4 on 2d square ribs for obstacles with high a r the two ends of the horseshoe vortex are farther apart and have smaller influence on the middle region of the wake unlike for small a r obstacles where they interact and cause the 3d behaviour of the wake intermediate a r were experimentally studied by martinuzzi and tropea 1993 they found that for a r 6 the recirculation region downstream of the cube switches from a 3d aspect to a nominally 2d aspect the main differences between 2d and 3d square obstacles are extensively described by schofield and logan 1990 few of the studies exposed in this bibliographic review present cases with r e 10 5 it is generally assumed that for r e 4 10 4 the flow achieves a certain reynolds number independency as found by castro and robins 1977 however that conclusion has been questioned in lim et al 2007 where it is explained that for vortex dominated flows the mean flow is likely to be re dependant the reynolds number based on h i n s i t u and u i n s i t u is substantially high r e i n s i t u h i n s i t u u i n s i t u ν 2 5 10 7 with ν the kinematic viscosity of water hence there is a necessity to extend the existing database for marine energy application through high reynolds number experiments few studies are lead on the far field of wide wall mounted obstacles in a high reynolds number flow and especially with a focus on the turbulent structures that are emitted from the wake large turbulent events can have a major impact on turbines mycek et al 2014 hence the need to investigate them in many cases in the literature coherent turbulent structures can be observed past an obstacle or in a turbulent boundary layer one of the most extensive analysis of structures emitted from turbulent boundary layers is the work of adrian et al 2000 they detailed the creation detection and transport of hairpin structures in the flow for wide square plates the numerical study of diabil et al 2017 for r e 6 5 10 3 shows that kelvin helmholtz vortices are shed from the upstream face of the obstacle periodically shed vortices create corotating pairs that lead to vortex pairing as described by the annual review of leweke et al 2016 their analysis uses a lamb oseen model for vortex profile fitting as will be done here müller and gyr 1987 demonstrate that these vortices interact or merge to create hairpin structures these hairpins are sometimes called kolk vortices in other studies best 2005b such structures are very energetic and can rise up to the surface to form a large boil best 2005a volino et al 2009 studied coherent structures created over a rough bottom they show that their size varies with the upstream flow conditions however the rising angle is conserved sabatino and rossmann 2016 proposed tomographic piv measurements of hairpin vortex developing in laminar boundary layers they illustrate how hairpin vortices regenerate with the creation of secondary hairpin vortices this kind of turbulent structures shall be characterized in order to predict their trajectory and frequency as well as the incoming velocity profile on tidal turbines in this paper coherent structures developing from the wake of a wall mounted cylinder representative of seabed element is studied the experimental set up is first presented and test cases are detailed then the characterization of the wake past the cylinder is carried out from experimental results in and out of the symmetry plane vortices are studied and a method to detect their centre and track their position is proposed a lamb oseen vortex approximation is proposed for the determination of the vortex properties a temporal analysis is added to the turbulent structures analysis finally a discussion on the turbulent organisation formed in the obstacle wake is proposed 2 experimental set up the tests are carried out in the wave and current circulating flume tank of ifremer located in boulogne sur mer france presented in fig 2 a the test section is 18 m long 4 m wide 2 m high in this work the three instantaneous velocity components are denoted u v w along the x y z directions respectively fig 2 b each instantaneous velocity component is separated into a mean value and a fluctuating part according to the reynolds decomposition u u u where an overbar indicates the time average the incoming flow u v w is assumed to be steady and constant by means of a grid and a honeycomb that acts as a flow straightener placed at the inlet of the working section see fig 2 b a turbulent intensity of i 1 5 is achieved for a flow velocity of 1 m s turbulence intensity i in the incoming flow is defined as follows 1 i 100 1 3 u 2 v 2 w 2 u 2 v 2 w 2 the wall mounted cylinder is chosen to be representative of real life conditions as there is no obstacle upstream of the cylinder the upstream flow is a simple boundary layer developing over the tank floor hence the experimental set up represents a bump considerably higher than its neighbours to consider turbulent events interaction with the free surface experiments shall be achieved in froude similitude see table 1 where f r u g d with g the gravity and d the tank depth furthermore reynolds number must be as high as achievable to be closer to real conditions the obstacle of interest in this study is a wall mounted cylinder of aspect ratio a r width height 6 represented in fig 3 this element represents a key bathymetric element in the area of interest at a 1 20 scale see table 1 in the following study non dimensional lengths are used for all parameters indexed by x x h y y h z z h and δ δ h with h the cylinder height h 0 25 m at the obstacle position the boundary layer height δ is calculated as δ 95 z u 0 95 u it yields δ 1 3 to characterize the flow two laser velocimetry techniques are used ldv laser doppler velocimetry and piv particle image velocimetry see fig 3 beforehand the tank is seeded with 10 μ m diameter silver coated glass micro particles for the piv measurements a nd yag laser gemini like is used power is 200 m j per probe and wavelength is 532 m m the laser is synchronized with a camera flowsens eo 2m 1600 pix 1200 pix that makes double images with a time step of 1600 μ s a particle is detected on 3 to 5 pixels cross correlation peak intensity is between 0 3 and 0 8 and peak detectability ratio of the tallest correlation peak and the second tallest correlation peak adrian and westerweel 2011 is 8 in average piv acquisitions are made for 150 s hence 2250 double images are taken with a 15 h z acquisition frequency the data are post processed with the software dynamic studio the displacement of particles is calculated using a cross correlation on 32 pix 32 pix interrogation windows with 50 overlap meinhart et al 1993 outliers are replaced with the universal outlier detection westerweel and scarano 2005 depending on the plane from 1 to 13 of the total vectors number are substituted single pass method is used as in our case multi pass adaptive piv leads to errors generating artefacts rather than improving resolution piv measurements are carried out at various transverse positions y 0 y 1 and y 2 denoted y 0 y 1 and y 2 respectively summarized in table 2 and represented in fig 4 b fig 4 a shows the 13 measurement planes carried out for each transverse position in the tank using a wide angle lens for a large surface detection only vertical piv measurement planes can be achieved hence only 2d measurements of u w will be performed in this study the experimental set up allows measurements for z 0 5 7 fig 5 illustrates the post processing steps applied in the plane y 0 from the raw image to the universal outlier detection uod the cross correlation cc results are obtained with a mask applied on the cylinder the ldv measurements are made using a 2d dantec fiberflow system the probe is positioned horizontally for u v measurements at various streamwise positions along the z axis with ldv measurements the acquisition frequency is not constant it depends on the number of particles passing through the measurement volume then a re sampling is done in the post processing based on previous works performed in the tank duràn medina et al 2015 the re sampling is done using the mean sample rate of the measurement set considered at a specific streamwise position f e varies from 70 to 270 h z depending on the turbulent agitation various sources of experimental errors can be identified positions fixed using the human eyes are considered to have a maximum error of 0 5 c m and 0 5 it is the case for the obstacle and the lasers positioning particles motion follows the basset boussinesq oseen equation for silver covered glass particle the response of particle is of 0 14 m m s the laser sheet induces a magnification that causes an error of 0 3 adrian and westerweel 2011 measurements standard deviation goes up to 0 1 calibration is achieved by the ldv manufacturer additionally the vibration of the ldv probe due to vortex induced vibrations can induce an error up to 0 5 c m piv calibration is precise at 1 m m the pixel size is added to the errors for piv measurements hence the errors on the results are of 2 and 2 6 for ldv and piv respectively a comparison is made in fig 6 between piv and ldv measurements in the symmetry plane showing a good coherency 3 characterization of the wake past the wall mounted cylinder average velocity maps of u and w in planes y 0 y 1 and y 2 are presented in fig 7 in these figures the classical behaviour of the flow past a wall mounted element can be observed the flow separates at the leading edges of the cylinder into the outer steady region and the recirculation area downstream of the cylinder a shear layer develops in between and then the flow reattaches the recirculation length downstream of the obstacle is evaluated for the 3 planes l y 0 6 l y 1 5 5 and l y 2 4 5 as expected the apparition of 3d effects mainly impacts planes for y y 1 the l reduction between y 0 and y 1 is 8 and l reduction increases to 18 between y 1 and y 2 in martinuzzi and tropea 1993 at a similar r e and a r a recirculation length of l 5 7 has been measured in the symmetry plane which is close to our results maps of the average vertical velocity w out of the symmetry plane indicate that the flow passing over the obstacle is similar in the 3 planes for x 2 however downstream of the cylinder the flow is considerably redirected towards the floor for position y 2 with a large and intense w 0 zone in y 0 the flow shows an area of w 0 beginning at x 6 from the floor up to z 1 the wake is impulsed towards the surface fig 8 a and b show that in y 0 the transverse component v is relatively unaffected by the cylinder wake the velocity fluctuations at z 2 indicate a large shear stress area for u and w that does not affect v at z 2 for instance values are u u 0 64 0 2 v u 0 003 0 04 and w u 0 05 0 16 in order to better understand the development of the wake past the cylinder average reynolds shear stress τ u w u w maps are plotted in fig 9 some areas suffer from the poor lightning and data in these area are not fully converged however it appears that the shear layer reduces faster for y 1 compared to y 0 although the global orientation is similar in field y 2 the shear layer length reduces by half and is reoriented towards the floor here the shear layer length is estimated as the length corresponding to the position at which τ u w u 2 0 02 this effect is also visible when comparing w maps in fig 7 in x 7 the shear layer starts disappearing for y 2 but persists for the other two planes 4 turbulent structures dynamics during the experiments performed for this study large boils are observed at the tank free surface as illustrated in fig 10 taken 8 m past the obstacle such events originate in the shear layer past the cylinder and rise up to the surface located at 2 m from the bottom these events are highly energetic with a 1 m diameter it is the same kind of vortices that can be observed at the sea surface in the alderney race these events evolving in the water column and carrying high velocity variations might have a strong impact on tidal turbines their investigation is detailed in this section in order to be able to quantify their effect on the flow impacting a potential turbine in this part pod proper orthogonal decomposition is used as a filter on piv measurement results in order to highlight the highest energetic structures and leave aside the non coherent turbulent part then based on the extracted energetic flow structures a centre detection algorithm is implemented on pod filtered data in order to characterize the dynamic of turbulent events present in the flow structures properties are also investigated using a lamb oseen vortex approximation 4 1 pod filter and vortex properties 4 1 1 pod filter pod is an efficient and optimal mathematical tool to extract energetic coherent structures embedded in a turbulent flow it was first introduced by lumley 1967 the snapshot version of pod sirovich 1987 is used in the present work details of the implementation of the pod technique applied to piv database can be found in druault et al 2005 2012 following previous works ikhennicheu et al 2018a a vectorial pod is performed in this study in order to determine the number of pod modes n p o d used to filter the large turbulent structures the effect of pod filter on the fluctuating velocity field is investigated in fig 11 during the passing of a vortex in plane b see fig 4 this specific vortex is selected because its centre position is in the middle of the plane and because there is no other vortex close by in the raw field without filter a vortex appears but its centre is difficult to properly position with n p o d 20 the pod filter is efficient although some turbulent noise is still present and that could hinter the centre detection with n p o d 10 rotating velocity is weaker since it is less energetic hence the required pod modes number lies between 10 and 20 which corresponds to between 69 and 76 of the total kinetic energy level arbitrary it is chosen to take in the following 70 of the total kinetic energy for each measurement plane for plane b it corresponds to 13 modes 4 1 2 vortex properties a centre detection algorithm inspired by the method proposed by graftieaux et al 2001 and adapted for piv measurements by druault et al 2005 is here considered in each point m the tangential fluctuating velocity v θ is evaluated for the 2 8 16 neighbours as represented in fig 12 if every v θ around m has the same sign a vortex centre is detected a sensibility analysis allowed to fix 16 vortices to achieve a good centre detection to have trajectories long enough for statistic analysis this study is restricted to trajectories detected on at least 7 temporally consecutive detected points corresponding to a minimal detection time of 7 δ t 0 47 s the centre detected with the algorithm is indicated with a red dot in fig 13 the full trajectory obtained is represented in fig 14 following previous studies hamed et al 2017 leweke et al 2016 the head of vortices supposed to be hairpin vortices detected in 2d piv planes can be modelled thanks to a simplified lamb oseen vortex model following moriconi 2009 such vortex is defined by equation 2 2 v θ r γ 2 π r 1 e x p r 2 r c 2 with γ the circulation and r the radius r c is the vortex core size see fig 15 b dimensionless values are used r c r c h and γ γ h u only vortices that are in the middle of the plane can be properly fitted since a sufficient quantity of data points is necessary a vortex passing in the middle of plane b is chosen its tangential velocity v θ is plotted with r r h 2 2 and θ 0 i e z constant as illustrated in fig 15 a it is then fitted by a lamb oseen profile in fig 15 b the lamb oseen model is designed for circular symmetrical vortices due to a ratio between the size of the vortex and the height of the measurement plane close to 1 it is not possible to perform a lamb oseen vortex approximation for θ 0 to θ 90 for all vortices to make sure the approximation is valid in every direction it is only possible for some vortices that are located at mid height of the plane fig 16 shows two cases of vortices for which the approximation is performed for θ 0 and θ 90 most of the vortices are symmetrical similar to the one on fig 16 a however some vortices present an elliptical form which results in the non identical profiles presented on fig 16 b more precisions on the specific case of elliptical vortices will be given later in the paper 4 2 analysis of the turbulent structures the algorithm is applied to every piv measurement plane all the trajectories are gathered in fig 17 a for the plane y 0 the top of the shear layer is determined from fig 9 where τ u w 0 02 this figure shows that vortices are generated in the beginning of the shear layer and are then emitted in the flow close to the obstacle first piv planes x 4 it is expected that trajectories detected are kelvin helmholtz vortices higher in the water column and further in the flow detected vortices are expected to resemble hairpin vortices trajectories are also presented in plane y 1 in fig 17 b results are similar to those obtained for y 0 while in y 2 no vortiex is detected it is assumed that the same wide 3d structure is detected on both 2d planes y 0 and y 1 as sections of a larger 3d structure even if vortices detected in one plane are not linked with vortices detected in the contiguous plane the 3d shape of the vortices is then contained in a 2 h 3 h 2 h volume x y z directions the planes a b and c contain the most vortices they are also the most representative of the vortex behaviour since they are located just above the shear layer where turbulent structures are emitted fig 18 illustrates the trajectories detected for planes a b and c on plane a trajectories are impulsed from the shear layer and oriented towards the surface with an angle of 9 all trajectories are localized in the low part of the plane then for planes b and c trajectories appear more horizontal and more scattered they are being dispersed and carried out by the flow it is worth noticing that some trajectories in plane b in bold in fig 18 b are particularly oriented towards the surface it is assumed that these are the trajectories of vortices that might erupt at the surface a linear interpolation is achieved on every trajectory in order to study the rising angle γ of each vortex in average the mean rising angle γ is found between 6 to 10 it is substantially higher than the average rising angle of the shear layer which is around 4 see fig 9 a there is a strong dispersion of γ due to the large range of trajectory angles however the average rising angle reduces when x increases the discrepancy of rising angle results in fig 17 might be caused by 3d effects in the wake or by the unsteady interaction of emitted vortices with one another as explained by müller and gyr 1987 the boil represented in fig 10 corresponds to a rarely occurred event with an angle of 14 which is in the higher range of vortex trajectories this indicates that some trajectories are particularly impulsed towards the surface compared to others the low rising angle trajectories cannot be observed in the present set up since they would erupt downstream of the working section end where the boil picture represented in fig 10 is taken the approximation of the vortex fluctuating tangential velocity with a lamb oseen profile is applied to vortices located in the middle of the measurement plane in order to have enough data points for profile fitting the superposition of fitted profiles for plane c is plotted in fig 19 this shows that the vortex profiles are generally symmetrical about their vertical axis v θ varies between 0 21 0 25 velocity profiles are slightly non symmetrical about their horizontal axis v θ is larger upstream of the vortex centre where its value is positive it is connected to the rising trajectory towards the free surface the radius r c and the circulation γ obtained with the lamb oseen vortex approximation are presented in table 3 for plane y 0 the number of vortices that present enough data points for profile fitting is indicated compared to the total number of trajectories detected in the measurement plane standard deviation is around 25 on r c but higher on γ nevertheless global behaviour can be drawn from these results γ decreases when x increases and r c does not variate significantly vortices that are emitted from the shear layer weaken due to dissipation effect in average vortices have a diameter of 0 30 m h in the symmetry plane in the sense of the lamb oseen vortex approximation however the vortices fluctuations themselves are present as long as v θ 0 and in that perspective the diameter of the vortex velocity perturbations is of the order of 1 m the lamb oseen modelling is also applied to y 1 vortices and averaged results are presented in table 3 results are within the same range as in plane y 0 especially when accounting for the standard deviations the same global behaviour is observed γ reduces when x increases and the radius r c does not variate significantly nevertheless both metrics are inferior to those in the symmetry plane it means that weak 3d effects exist although they cannot be more thoroughly investigated with the available database structures are then larger and more energetic in the symmetry plane it appears to be consistent with hairpin vortices centred around the symmetry plane most of the vortices whose trajectories are described in fig 18 have a low rising angle trajectory γ 5 3 with circular form as shown in fig 20 the rising velocity v v t x v z u is evaluated here at v v t x 0 3 otherwise some of the trajectories are more oriented towards the surface with a higher rising angle on fig 18 b trajectories with the highest rising angle are highlighted it appears that these trajectories present a common behaviour while rising up the vortex shifts from a circular to an elliptical form circulation around it becomes more intense the vortex dynamic of the yellow trajectory in bold in fig 18 b is illustrated in fig 21 for this example the rising velocity is v v t x 0 8 more than 2 times the horizontal case with a rising angle of 16 2 three times superior for the nine selected events rising up averaged results give a radius of 0 64 0 08 and a circulation of 1 7 0 3 in the previous section lamb oseen vortex approximation gave in average r c 0 68 0 2 and γ 1 4 0 4 for all trajectories in plane b these results confirm the previous observations indeed as the vortex becomes elliptical its horizontal radius r c reduces hence high rising angle vortices are more energetic and their shape changes as they extend towards the surface rising up in the water column 4 3 temporal analysis using ldv measurements a spectral analysis is performed in the symmetry plane y 0 acquisitions last 6 min and frequency varies for each streamwise position x the lowest average acquisition frequency for each altitude is taken f e x 7 84 h z and f e x 11 75 h z using f e ldv signals are re sampled signals are then cut into blocks of 1024 points and a fast fourier transform is applied on every block power spectrum densities are then plotted versus the strouhal number s t f h u in fig 22 a and b in the near field altitudes are chosen to represent the flow above under and at the shear layer position three different flow behaviours are detected first below z 3 x 7 for and below z 3 6 for x 11 the energetic content is high since those points are located in the shear layer furthermore a sharp peak is detected for s t 0 062 second there is a transitional part in between where spectrum do not show any peak and third above z 3 4 for x 7 and above z 3 6 for x 11 the energetic content is lower and the peak is detected for a higher frequency of s t 0 072 the higher peak s t 0 072 is close to the literature for dunes cases in omidyeganeh and piomelli 2011 it corresponds to the vortex shedding periodic events indicated by the lower peak s t 0 062 happening underneath the shed vortices in the shear layer do not impact the higher altitudes of the water column therefore every event occurring in the top part of the water column must originate from vortices shed from the shear layer the same result was found by omidyeganeh and piomelli 2011 that carried out les simulation on dunes fig 22 c shows the presence of a peak in the far field close to the surface that measurement point is the only one available for x 11 the peak is around s t 0 072 confirming that the events detected above the shear layer are still present at the same frequency close to the surface and they will presumably erupt at the free surface the peak intensity is lower than the peak close to the obstacle indicating a lower energetic content in fig 23 a map of instantaneous u w obtained from piv measurements for z versus t is plotted for a chosen streamwise position at x 11 a vortex passing is detected with a high u w 0 peak followed by u w 0 with amplitude superior to 0 02 at mid height z 3 periodic vortex passing is observed it matches the frequency found in fig 22 for vortex shedding the constant shedding of vortices is visible until z 3 5 which is the boundary of the shear layer some events are more energetic than others and are still persistent above z 4 at t 40 s for instance these highly turbulent events that rise higher are more energetic than others on figs 23 and 24 two zones are highlighted in red a zone that presents highly turbulent events rising higher than the average turbulent events they are still visible on the signals at z 4 in green a zone where vortices do not show higher than z 3 5 instantaneous u w signals are plotted in fig 24 at the same streamwise position x 11 and for two altitudes z 3 and z 4 for the 150 s of the piv acquisition this figure illustrates what is explained in the previous section at z 3 vortex shedding induces a periodic fluctuating velocity variation it occurs at the frequency detected in the spectrum in fig 22 b at a higher position z 4 although the frequency is still visible on the spectrum it does not show on the signals with the used scale some intense events are detected these are the very energetic events that rise higher than the shear layer and they will be assimilated to hairpin structures in the next section 4 4 discussion on detected vortices looking at previous results there seems to be two kinds of structures coexisting in the cylinder wake the presence of the obstacle in a flow promotes the creation of a shear layer and as in a mixing layer kelvin helmholtz instabilities are generated from the velocity difference between the outer flow and the recirculation region underneath these vortices are detected on the edges of the shear layer close to the obstacle which is consistent with kelvin helmholtz instabilities the shedding frequency is detected in the spectral analysis then as demonstrated in müller and gyr 1987 leweke et al 2016 these events can merge pair up or interact to form hairpin structures it is indeed illustrated by the works of diabil et al 2017 and by chaurasia and thompson 2011 both working on the flow past large plates hairpin structures are then more persistent and energetic with a higher rising angle and they are ejected towards the free surface structures transverse extension is around 2 h 0 5 m and the resulting boils are around 1 m wide it implies that hairpin structures generate boils wider than their width when erupting at the surface best 2005a temporal analysis validates the assumption that these structures are hairpin boil generating vortices created from kelvin helmholtz vortices interactions in the separated shear layer as detailed by müller and gyr 1987 this assumption opposes to hairpin vortices generated underneath the shear layer from near wall bursts or reattachment flapping conjectures kiya and sasaki 1985 kadota and nezu 1999 such explanations are consistent with vortices detected in the piv measurement planes being 2d sections of a larger 3d event furthermore these events are only visible past large a r obstacles indeed in previous works ikhennicheu et al 2018a it is shown that in the case of low a r obstacles such as a wall mounted cube kelvin helmholtz vortices do not form structures able to rise up to the free surface it is also explained by diabil et al 2017 in their numerical study on large and low a r plates 5 conclusion and perspectives in this study the flow past a wide wall mounted square cylinder of aspect ratio a r 6 is studied from piv measurements the wake past the obstacle is characterized key elements of the wake past the obstacle are identified recirculation length in the symmetry plane is l 6 it then reduces by 8 in y 1 and 18 in y 2 average reynolds shear stress maps illustrate the shear layer behaviour its position is very similar between y 0 and y 1 whereas in y 2 it is redirected towards the floor the flow behaviour is similar between y 0 and y 1 and shows significant differences for y 2 with the apparition of side effects at the free surface of the tank 1 m wide boils can be observed these events originate in the cylinder wake and rise up to the surface in order to understand these structures behaviour piv measurements are filtered using proper orthogonal decomposition based on existing methods a centre detection algorithm is applied it allows to elucidate vortices trajectories no vortex is large or energetic enough to be detected in field y 2 authors conclude that the transverse extend of the vortex lies between y 0 and y 1 hence from 2 h to 4 h 0 5 m to 1 m in average the rising angle of vortices is 8 which is higher than the shear layer rising angle of 4 velocity profiles are fitted with a lamb oseen profile showing that the vortices radius stays similar with x r c 0 69 in y 0 however circulation reduces with x it is an effect of vortices dissipation it is then showed that some vortices are impulsed towards the surface they show a stronger circulation a larger rising velocity and their shape shifts from a circular to an elliptical form finally a temporal analysis validates that some events rise higher in the water column than others in the discussion authors suggest that two phenomena coexist kelvin helmholtz instabilities develop downstream of the obstacle in the shear layer close to the obstacle then these events merge pair up or interact to form hairpin structures ejected towards the free surface to form large boils such boils that exist at sea can have a major impact on turbines and must be considered in calculations for loads on tidal turbines the problem investigated here is also under development from a numerical perspective mercier et al 2017 after validation

22797,water lubricated stern tube bearings are widely used to support the propeller shaft in marine applications the material of the stern tube bearing is usually rubber or polymer since water creates the lubricating film at the shaft bearing interface the friction coefficient on the bearing in the boundary and mixed lubricating area where the friction induced vibration frequently occurs is usually higher than that of oil furthermore the friction coefficient is reduced as the speed of the shaft revolution increases within the regime in which static friction is dominant in this case the shaft bearing system can become unstable due to the stick slip motion of the shaft bearing system and self excited vibration can occur in this study the shaft bearing system is described using a two degrees of freedom model and a stability analysis is performed in accordance with system parameters such as normal load damping on the bearing and the natural frequency of the shaft system related to the stick slip motion at the shaft bearing interface in addition stick slip nonlinear friction induced vibration is reproduced with a test unit that can simulate stick slip nonlinear friction induced vibrationof the propulsion shaft of the ship we attempt to how the stick slip vibration is identified using signal processing of the test unit acceleration keywords friction induced vibration stern tube bearing stick slip 1 introduction generally a ship propulsion shaft is supported by a water lubricant stern tube bearing in marine applications the stern tube bearing is usually made of polymer and rubber when the speed of the shaft is sufficiently high a well developed lubricant film can be established however when the speed is low and the load at the bearing is high the lubricating film could break down this failure of the lubricating film usually occurs when the coefficient curve of speed versus friction has a negative slope under these conditions a stick slip process can occur between the propulsion shaft and stern tube bearing when this kind of stick slip process occurs the propulsion shaft becomes unstable and nonlinear friction induced vibration can occur therefore many studies have been conducted regarding nonlinear friction induced vibration at the water lubricant stern tube bearing simpson and ibrahim 1996 made a mechanical model of the stern tube bearing and the shaft with a two dof degree of freedom nonlinear system and approximated it to linear system using taylor series expansion they estimated that the self excited nonlinear vibration caused by the instability of the system on the shaft bearing interface could occur when the stick slip nonlinear motion occurred zhang et al 2014a 2014b investigated the stability and dynamics of a propeller shaft system that induced a nonlinear friction force on the shaft bearing contact interface they modeled the shaft bearing system with two dof which means that the shaft considered only rotating and bearing forces suggesting stable conditions of the shaft bearing system that do not cause stick slip vibrations with respect to the shaft rotating speed bhushan 1980 investigated the stick slip induced noise in a water lubricating rubber bearing through laboratory experiments he created a facility that could measure the chattering and squealing sounds of the water lubricating rubber bearing under varying conditions of normal load on the bearing shaft speed roughness of the bearing surface and solid lubricating as a result he defined the occurrence regime of chattering and squealing noises at the bearing surface under various conditions peng et al 2012 measured the friction coefficient of a water lubricated rubber stern tube bearing in a test facility varying the temperature and pressure of water in the clearance between the shaft and the bearing he found that the dynamic friction coefficient and the squealing noise occurrence regime varied according to the temperature and pressure of water in the clearance albers and herbst 1998 defined the characteristics of the chattering noise in the clutch disc and found that it could be caused by self induced as well as pressure induced chattering he found that the self induced chattering was caused by a friction coefficient change with regard to the slip speed which is highly related to the stick slip motion in the shaft bearing interface furthermore pressure induced chattering is the result of an outside impulse source with periodic excitation because stick slip vibration can cause a wearing problem for the rubber and composite bearing the nonlinear friction induced vibration with respect to the wearing has been studied hirani and verma 2009 zhimin et al 2015 wang et al 2017 in the present study the mechanism of nonlinear stick slip friction induced vibration is investigated with a two dof simple rotating model moreover stick slip nonlinear vibration is reproduced using a test unit that can simulate the vibration of the propulsion shaft rotating on the water lubricating bearing in addition an experimental diagnosis of the stick slip friction induced vibration is suggested using envelop analysis through experiments with this test unit 2 theory since it is very difficult to describe the exact motion of the real propulsion shaft suffering to the stick slip motion an approximated simple model is commonly used to explain the mechanism of the stick slip nonlinear friction induced vibration 1 3 therefore assuming that the propulsion shaft and water lubricating stern tube bearing can be simply modeled with two dof as shown in fig 1 the equation of its motion can be derived as shown in eq 1 1 i θ c t θ k t θ f r 0 μ d n r 0 m q c q k q f μ d n where i is the mass of inertia of the shaft θ is the angular displacement of the bearing c t is the torsional damping of the shaft k t is the torsional stiffness of the shaft m is the mass of the bearing c is the damping of the bearing k is the stiffness of the bearing f is the friction force r 0 is the radius of the shaft μ d is the friction coefficient of the shaft bearing interface and n is the normal load acting on the bearing surface in eq 1 the friction coefficient on the interface of bearing and shaft varies according to the shaft rotating speed as shown in fig 2 when the shaft speed versus the friction coefficient curve has a negative slope the friction force can make the total damping coefficient of the shaft and bearing negative and the vibration displacements of the system cannot be converged therefore self excited vibration can seriously occur because the shaft bearing system becomes unstable the friction coefficient can be represented by eq 2 simpson and ibrahim 1996 when the shaft speed versus friction coefficient curve has a negative slope as shown in fig 2 2 μ d x μ 0 μ 1 μ 0 e a x here μ 1 and μ 0 are the static and dynamic coefficients of friction respectively and a is a constant defining θ and q are defined as the angular and linear displacements of the shaft and bearing respectively when the vibration disappears under steady state conditions they can be respectively represented by eqs 3

vibrating conditions of bearing and shaft f s is the friction force under steady state conditions without vibration of bearing and shaft when the slope of the shaft speed and friction coefficient curve is negative the right hand term can be represented using eq 2 as shown in eq 7 7 f f d f s μ 0 μ 1 μ 0 e a r 0 ω r θ q n μ 0 μ 1 μ 0 e a r 0 ω n n μ 1 μ 0 e a r 0 ω e a r θ q 1 a e a r θ q 1 w h

shown in eq 11 11 f a a q r 0 θ therefore the equations of motion in eq 6 can be rewritten as shown in eqs 12 and 13 12 θ 2 ζ t ω t r 0 2 a a i θ r 0 a a i t q ω t 2 θ 0 q 2 ζ ω n a a m q r 0 a a i θ

1 2 3 4 in eq 20 when the real part of the eigen value a 1 a 2 is positive the displacements of the shaft and bearing θ q diverge over time and as self excited friction induced vibration occurs due to stick slip motion at the shaft bearing interface therefore the real parts of all solutions should be negative in order to prohibit self excited friction induced vibration which means that c1 c4 in eqs 16 19 should be positive based on these criteria the difference between the static and the dynamic friction coefficient should be satisfied with eqs 21 23 in order to maintain a stable state when

introduced in which the vibration estimated to be caused by stick slip motion between shaft and bearing occurs at the water lubricated stern tube bearing of a ship fig 3 shows the propulsion shaft systems described in this section within which the stick slip friction induced vibration in the water lubricated stern tube bearing occurred during the ship trial test in the propulsion shaft of the ship fig 3 the chatter sound occurred at particular rpm ranges of the propulsion shaft n rpm in order to find out whether this chatter sound was caused by stick slip friction induced vibration accelerometers pcb type 352c03 were installed at the hull near the stern tube bearing and an envelope analysis was conducted for these signals envelop analysis is widely used to determine whether some high frequency broadband noise is modulated with a specific frequency or not for diagnosis of bearing faults gear faults propeller cavitation etc in the bearing the friction force vibrates in the high and broadband frequency ranges furthermore it modulates with the shaft rotating frequency and its harmonics therefore when the envelop analysis is performed for the noise and vibration signal in the bearing housing or an adjacent structure under a normal friction state the peak signal frequencies of the envelop spectrum are revealed at the rotating frequency and its harmonics in ship applications the noise and vibration in the bearing housing or adjacent structures caused by friction can also by modulated by the propeller blade passing frequency this happens because the alternating trust load acts eccentrically with respect to the shaft rotating center and creates an alternating bending moment and its resultant normal load on the bearing surface as referred to in the previous section the system can be unstable when the slope of the friction coefficient versus the speed curve is negative and the stick slip motion can occur in the shaft bearing interface when the stick slip nonlinear vibration occurs this high and broadband noise and vibration on the bearing housing or its adjacent structure is modulated with particular natural frequencies of the bearing system as well as the shaft rotating frequency and its harmonics therefore a normal friction problem and a stick slip nonlinear vibration problem can be distinguished by whether the envelop spectrum on the bearing housing or its adjacent structure has its peak at the natural frequency and its harmonics the analytic signal of the envelop analysis is obtained from eq 24 and the enveloped signal is the amplitude of the analytic signal as shown in eq 25 10 24 h ˆ t h t j h t 25 h ˆ t h t 2 h t 2 0 5 where h t is the time signal of the raw data and h t is the hilbert transform of h t as shown in eq 26 26 h t h h t 1 π h t d t τ t when the fft analysis is performed with the envelop signal of eq 25 the modulated frequency can be identified in order to measure the acceleration on the bearing housing and ship structure for the shaft system in fig 3 the bruel kjaer type 3560bdata acquisition system was used when the envelop analysis was performed for the measured accelerations the band pass filter was set to 6 4 3 2 khz fig 4 shows the time signal of the acceleration on the hull adjacent to the stern tube bearing at n 40 and n rpm of the propulsion shaft in fig 4 a it can be seen that the acceleration is stable over time when the rotating speed is n 40 rpm however when it increases to n rpm it remains stable at first but after 25s it increases and changes irregularly over time as shown in fig 4 b fig 5 shows the contour diagram of fft spectra for acceleration versus time in fig 4 for the military security the value of the x axis is not shown when the shaft rpm is n 40 rpm only small peaks at shaft rotational frequency and the second harmonic of the br blade passing frequency exist in the contour diagram of fft spectra as shown in fig 5 a when the shaft s rpm increases to n rpm the acceleration at the particular natural frequency of the bearing f n hz and its harmonics as well as the br were dominant as shown in fig 5 b in addition the high frequency broadband vibration increases to over 500 hz as shown in fig 5 c in fig 5 the vibration at the br in the fft spectrum could be estimated to occur from the vibratory normal load at the bearing surface caused by the alternating bending moment induced by an off centered trust force of the propeller due to the eccentric axial wake distribution meanwhile accelerations at f n hz and its harmonics may not be estimated to be caused by the external force but by self excited vibration from stick slip nonlinear friction induced vibration in order to verify this hypothesis an envelope analysis of the hull s acceleration at n and n 40 rpm is performed with a bruel kjaer pulse envelop module as shown in fig 6 in order to evaluate whether this extreme vibration and the chatter noise of the propulsion shaft system was caused by stick slip friction induced vibration or not here the value of the x axis is not shown for the military security in fig 6 a the envelop spectrum peaks at the pole passing frequency f s hz of the electric motor and its harmonics appear without peaks at br and the natural frequency of the bearing the peak signal at the pole passing frequency of the electric motor and its harmonics is revealed in the envelop spectrum because the vibration of the second harmonics of the inverter switching frequency 9 khz is strong at this rpm and it is modulated with the pole passing frequency of the electric motor and its harmonics even though some peaks are revealed in envelop spectrum there is no vibration issue at n 40 rpm when increasing the shaft rpm to n the peak components at the natural frequency of the bearing f n hz and its harmonics are revealed through the envelop spectrum it can be known that the friction induced vibration with high and broadband frequency is modulated with the natural frequency of the bearing and its harmonics since acceleration signals at natural frequencies of the bearing shaft system are revealed well when the stick slip nonlinear friction induced noise occurs it can be strongly estimated that the extreme vibration and chatter noise in the shaft system for the practical case described in this section is caused by stick slip nonlinear friction induced vibration in order to verify more accurately that the practical vibration problem described in this section was caused by stick slip nonlinear vibration a test unit that can simulate the stick slip friction induced vibration on the water lubricated bearing was developed in order to reproduce the practical stick slip vibration problem discussed in this section 4 verification of the vibration occurring mechanism from stick slip in this section the experiment to reproduce stick slip nonlinear friction induced vibration occurring at the interface between shaft and water lubricated bearing is described the test unit to simulate the propulsion shaft applying a water lubricated bearing is manufactured and the test results using this test unit are investigated with theoretical results with respect to the stick slip nonlinear friction induced vibration in addition the test procedure is suggested to define whether the vibration of the shaft bearing system is caused by stick slip motion or not using an envelope analysis for the acceleration on the ship structure 4 1 test unit in order to simulate the stick slip nonlinear friction induced vibration that occurs in the water lubricated bearing of propulsion shaft for a ship a test unit was manufactured fig 7 and the detailed specifications are shown in table 1 as shown in fig 7 the water pump supplies lubricating water to the bearing in a water tank the normal force subjected to the bearing can be controlled by the lever installed under the foundation jig supporting the bearing this force can be measured by the load cell installed between the lever and foundation jig 4 2 stick slip producing regime in the regime where the friction coefficient is reduced with increasing shaft speed on the stribeck curve fig 2 stick slip nonlinear friction vibration can occur in this regime the occurrence of stick slip vibration is closely related to the friction coefficient of the bearing therefore the friction coefficient of a typical water lubricated bearing manufactured by thordon with xl material is measured according to the shaft speed normal load pressure of the water temperature and diametric clearance the bearing tested is shown in fig 8 the inner diameter of the bearing is 60 mm and its minimum diametric clearance is 0 3 mm according to the manufacturer s recommendation in their user manual in this study the bearing is manufactured such that the diametric clearances are 0 3 0 5 and 0 7 mm respectively in the test the friction coefficient can be estimated by eqs 27 and 28 27 t n t 0 μ d t f n 28 μ d t t n t 0 f n here μ d t is the friction coefficient of the bearing at time t t 0 is the torque of the shaft when the bearing is not installed t n is the torque of the shaft when the bearing is installed f n is the normal force applied on the bearing in eqs 27 28 the torque can be measured with the shear strain gauge mm model cea 06 250us 350 and telemetry system binsfeld model tt 10k lp installed on the shaft measured friction coefficients for the bearing with 0 3 0 5 and 0 7 mm clearances are shown in fig 9 when the normal load applied on the bearing is 600 n in fig 9 the friction coefficient is gradually decreased as the speed increases up to 800 rpm but there is no significant change over 800 rpm in the regime where the friction coefficient is decreased as the speed increases stick slip nonlinear friction induced vibration can occur considering that the diameter of the shaft is 60 mm the linear velocity on the bearing surface at 800 rpm is calculated to be 2 5 m s this speed can be regarded as the maximum speed at which stick slip vibration can occur compared with previous studies performed by y zhimin et al 2015 the maximum speed at which stick slip vibration can occur is similar in fig 9 the friction coefficient under 400 rpm for the bearing with a 0 3 mm clearance is higher than that for the bearings with 0 5 and 0 7 mm clearances therefore it can be determined that stick slip vibration may occur more easily when the clearance is 0 3 mm than when the clearance is 0 5 or 0 7 mm fig 10 shows the friction coefficient variations with respect to increasing temperature as measured with the bearings with 0 3 and 0 7 mm clearances respectively when the normal force on the bearing is 400 n in fig 10 the friction coefficient of the bearing with a 0 7 mm clearance does not varied sufficiently when the temperature of the lubricating water is increased from 27 to 47 1 c however the friction coefficient of the bearing with a 0 3 mm clearance increased sufficiently when the temperature of the lubricating water increased from 25 to 43 2 c from the test results it can be estimated that the thermal expansion caused by the friction on the bearing may make the clearance smaller than the minimum clearance suggested by the manufacturer when the clearance of the bearing was 0 3 mm therefore it can be estimated that the minimum limit of the bearing clearance suggested by manufacturer may be somewhat disadvantageous with respect to the stick slip friction induced vibration fig 11 shows the variation of the friction force as increasing pressure of the lubricating water from 0 1 to 0 45 mpa when the normal force on the bearing is 400 n and the rotating speed of the shaft is 400 rpm in fig 11 it can be found that the friction force increase with increasing water pressure when the pressure is applied to the lubricant fluid the velocity of the fluid flow on bottom side in the clearance is faster than that on the top side considering bernoulli s theory the pressure on the bottom side should be lower than that on the top side consequently the net force caused by fluid pressure applies on the bearing in the bottom direction therefore when the fluid pressure increased the net normal and friction force on the bearing also increased considering that submarines are sailing at deep water with high static pressure the stick slip nonlinear vibration appears to be more likely to occur in submarines rather than in surface ships because the friction force also increases as the pressure increases 4 3 stability evaluation in order to evaluate the stability of the test unit a theoretical analysis was performed with mechanical properties of the test unit as shown in table 2 here the mass of the bearing system is regarded to be the mass of the test unit 500 kgf and the mass moment of the inertia of the shaft is calculated with the shaft diameter 60 mm length 500 mm installed in the test unit since the damping ratio cannot be defined accurately it is assumed that the damping ratio of the shaft is 0 005 and that of the bearing is 0 005 0 05 the result for the stability of the system from the theoretical analysis is shown in fig 12 in fig 12 a it can be seen that the test unit becomes unstable when the speed of the shaft is lower than 100 rpm and the normal force on the bearing is 500 n under these conditions when the normal load increased to 1000 n and 2000n the speed limit at which the system becomes unstable increases to 250 rpm and 550 rpm respectively in fig 12 b when the natural frequency of the shaft system increases from 12 5 hz to 400 hz while the normal load on the bearing is fixed at 2000n it can be seen that the speed limit where the system is unstable is reduced from 550 rpm to 80 rpm fig 12 c shows the variation of the speed limit where the system is unstable according to the damping ratio of the bearing when the damping ratio is increased from 0 005 to 0 05 the speed limit where the system is unstable is reduced from 550 to 250 rpm when the normal force on the bearing is 2000n when the motion of the test unit becomes unstable the vibratory displacement of the system diverged and self excited vibration occurred at natural frequencies and harmonics for the shaft bearing system in order to verify the results of the stability analysis experimentally the characteristics of the vibration on the test unit are evaluated under the various condition at which the stick slip can occur 4 4 test results accelerations were measured on the motor base with 3 axis accelerometer pcb type 356a02 as shown in fig 13 in order to verify that the shaft bearing system of the test unit becomes unstable at the regime defined theoretically in the previous section here the accelerations are measured in longitudinal x axis lateral y axis and vertical direction z axis when the shaft speed is changed from 50 to 800 rpm fig 14 shows the time signal of acceleration in vertical direction on the motor base at 100 rpm and 800 rpm since the patterns of the measured acceleration are similar regardless of the direction of measurement the measured acceleration in the vertical direction is only shown in this section when the shaft speed is 100 rpm time signals of acceleration increase abnormally according to the time when the normal force is increased to 2000n as shown in fig 14 a however when the shaft speed is 800 rpm time signals of acceleration do not vary with time when the normal force is increased to 2000n as shown in fig 14 b these patterns of the signals are similar to those of the signals for the particular ship described in section 3 fig 4 fig 15 shows the contour diagram of the fft spectra of the acceleration on the motor base when the normal force on the bearing is increased from 0 to 2000n then maintained at 2000n in fig 15 there is no dominant acceleration signal except at the rotational frequency and its harmonics when the normal force on the bearing is 0 n however when the normal force is applied up to 2000n peak acceleration signals at the frequencies estimated to be the natural frequencies of the test unit are revealed regardless of shaft speed fig 15 when the shaft speed is in the range of 50 200 rpm under these conditions the acceleration components at the rotational frequency and its harmonics do not appear clearly because the revolution speed of the shaft is sufficiently changed by the friction force variation when the shaft speed increased to 800 rpm in fig 15 it can be seen that the variation of the acceleration in the fft spectrum is not large even though the normal force is increased up to 2000n when the impact test is performed and the frequency response function is investigated natural frequencies of the test unit can be known as shown in fig 16 here it can be known that frequencies of the peak values in fig 15 when the shaft rpm is 50 400 rpm are well coincident with natural frequencies measured in fig 16 considering that the peak component at the natural frequency of the shaft bearing system and its harmonics in the fft spectra reveal well when the stick slip nonlinear vibration occurs it can be estimated that stick slip nonlinear friction induced vibration occurs when the speed of the shaft is lower than 400 rpm as described in the previous section when stick slip friction induced vibration occurs vibration components caused by the friction occur in the broadband high frequency range in fft spectra and they are modulated by natural frequencies of the system as well as rotational and harmonic frequencies in order to find out whether the friction induced vibration is modulated by natural frequencies of the test unit or not envelop analysis is performed with the acceleration on the motor base under various operating conditions of the test unit prior to performing envelop analysis the bandpass filter should be selected and applied to the raw signal here the frequency band of the bandpass filter should include an increasing frequency range given the occurrence of friction induced vibration fig 17 is the fft spectrum of the acceleration on the motor mount of the test unit when the normal force is not applied on the bearing and when a 2000n force is applied on the bearing here the bearing clearance is 0 3 mm as shown in fig 17 the acceleration at the frequency range centered at 6 khz increases significantly when the normal force is applied on the bearing therefore this frequency range is considered to be the frequency band that is most affected by the friction induced vibration consequently the frequency band of the band pass filter for the envelop analysis is set to 6 3 2 khz fig 18 shows the contour diagram of the envelop spectra of the acceleration on the motor base in the vertical direction fig 16 after applying the bandpass filter selected from fig 17 in fig 18 the patterns of the envelop spectrum when the shaft speed is lower than 200 rpm are different than those at 400 rpm when the shaft speed is lower than 200 rpm and the normal force applied is 2000n peaks in the envelop spectrum at the natural frequencies of the test unit as well as their harmonics are significant when the shaft speed is lower than 200 rpm the peaks at the shaft rotational frequency and its harmonics do not seem obvious but it seems to spread these phenomena are typical characteristics of stick slip motion however when the shaft speed increases to 800 rpm only the peaks at the shaft rotational frequency and its harmonics are obvious and no peaks are seen at the natural frequencies of the test unit in addition there is no variation in the envelop spectra when a normal load of 2000n is applied therefore it can be noted that there is no stick slip motion at 800 rpm considering the stability analysis described in fig 12 c in the previous section it can be asserted that the test results agree with the theoretical stability analysis when fig 18 a c are compared to fig 6 b it can be seen that the shape and pattern of the envelop spectra of the test unit in which stick slip friction induced vibration occurs are similar to that of the practical case described in section 3 fig 19 shows the envelop spectrum of the acceleration on the motor base in the vertical direction when the shaft rotating speed is 100 rpm and the temperature of the lubricating water is changed to 35 c warm initially the temperature of water is 25 c cold and during this time the envelop spectrum is as shown in fig 18 b in fig 19 the normal force is increased gradually from 0 to 2000n then the normal force is maintained at 2000n as in fig 18 as described in section 4 2 the friction coefficient of the bearing with a 0 3 mm clearance is increased at low rpm when the temperature of the lubricating water increases when the friction coefficient increases the possibility of stick slip motion also increases however as shown in fig 19 peaks at natural frequencies and their harmonics as well as those at shaft rotating frequencies and their harmonics in the envelop spectrum are reduced when the temperature of the lubricating water increases despite this increase in the friction coefficient with respect to increasing temperature the damping of the bearing may also increase with respect to increasing temperature therefore it can be estimated from fig 19 that the slick slip nonlinear friction induced vibration is reduced when the temperature of the lubricating water of the bearing is increased due to increased damping of the bearing in addition envelop analysis was performed as shown in fig 20 for the acceleration on the motor base in the vertical direction when the shaft rotating speed was 100 rpm and the normal force was 2000n according to applying a rigid mount on the motor this test was performed in order to determine the variation of stick slip friction induced vibration according to increasing natural frequencies of the shaft bearing system when comparing fig 18 b to fig 20 similar to the results from theoretical analysis performed in section 4 3 almost all peeks in the envelop spectrum disappear when the natural frequency of the test unit increases from rigid mount installation for the motor therefore it can be estimated that the stick slip friction induced vibration can be avoided by increasing natural frequencies of the bearing shaft system when the shaft is misaligned the normal force on a certain bearing can be increased in this case slick slip friction induced vibration can occur at the shaft speed range where the friction coefficient is decreased according to increasing shaft rpm in this case the stick slip friction induced vibration can disappear by improving the alignment conditions of the shaft considering that the stick slip nonlinear friction induced vibration problem described in section 3 was dissipated by changing the rubber coupling it can be estimated that the stick slip friction induced vibration disappeared given the variation of the alignment conditions of the shaft similar to the results in fig 20 through the vibration test results with test units that simulate the propulsion shaft system of the naval vessel it can be confidently estimated that the vibration problem described in section 3 was caused by stick slip friction induced vibration in addition the theoretical investigation of stick slip friction induced vibration according to the variation of normal force bearing damping and natural frequencies can be reproduced by experiments and the evaluation method of friction induced vibration is proposed whether the peaks in natural frequencies of the test unit and its harmonics are present in the envelop spectrum or not 5 conclusion chattering noise caused by stick slip nonlinear friction induced vibration at the water lubricated stern tube bearing frequently occurs in ship applications in this study the mechanism of stick slip motion in a shaft bearing interface is suggested by a rotating model with two dof furthermore through reproducing a real case of stick slip nonlinear friction induced vibration with the test unit that simulates the vibration of the propulsion shaft of a naval vessel following conclusions can be obtained a stick slip nonlinear vibration can occur at the unstable condition in which the real part of the eigen value becomes positive and this condition can occur when the friction coefficient is decreased with respect to increasing shaft rotating speed b when the revolution speed of the test unit is lower than 800 rpm the lubricating condition becomes boundary and mixed lubricating condition as shown in fig 2 therefore it can be known that the shaft speed range where the stick slip friction vibration can occur is under 800 rpm for the test unit c when the normal force is increased on the bearing for the test unit stick slip nonlinear friction induced vibration can occur more easily and it is well coincident with estimation results by theoretical model d when the natural frequencies of the bearing and its supporting structure of the test unit by increasing stiffness of it the stick slip nonlinear friction induced vibration can be decreased and it is well coincident with estimation results by theoretical model e when the damping of the bearing increases the stick slip nonlinear friction induced vibration is reduced and it is well coincident with estimation results by theoretical model f comparing the envelop spectrum of the acceleration measured in the real case described in section 3 2 to that at the test unit which reproduces the stick slip friction induced vibration it can be seen that the pattern of the envelop spectrum as well as fft spectrum are very similar to each other it can be concluded that the vibration problems in the real cases described in section 3 2 are caused by stick slip nonlinear vibration in addition through experiments with the test unit that simulate stick slip friction induced vibration for a water lubricated bearing the characteristics of the vibration signal of the propulsion shaft system can be identified according to the system conditions as follows a normal friction induced vibration under stable conditions accelerations at the high and broadband frequency range can be detected in the fft spectrum on the bearing and shaft system in the envelop spectrum of the acceleration on the bearing and shaft system there are no peaks except for some components related to the shaft rotating frequency acceleration signals at the shaft rotating frequency and its harmonics on the fft and envelop spectrums are obvious b abnormal friction induced vibration under unstable conditions accelerations at the natural frequency of the propulsion shaft system and its harmonics as well as accelerations at high and broadband frequency range can be detected in the fft spectrum of the bearing and shaft system in the envelop spectrum of the acceleration on the bearing and shaft system peak signals at the natural frequencies of the propulsion shaft system and its harmonics can be detected acceleration signals at the shaft rotating frequency and its harmonics on the fft and envelop spectrums do not reveal obvious peaks but rather spread out signals since the vibratory torque from the friction force is varied by stick slip motion acknowledgment this research was performed in the defense agency for technology and quality and dtaq verified that it did not contain any information related to military security 
22797,water lubricated stern tube bearings are widely used to support the propeller shaft in marine applications the material of the stern tube bearing is usually rubber or polymer since water creates the lubricating film at the shaft bearing interface the friction coefficient on the bearing in the boundary and mixed lubricating area where the friction induced vibration frequently occurs is usually higher than that of oil furthermore the friction coefficient is reduced as the speed of the shaft revolution increases within the regime in which static friction is dominant in this case the shaft bearing system can become unstable due to the stick slip motion of the shaft bearing system and self excited vibration can occur in this study the shaft bearing system is described using a two degrees of freedom model and a stability analysis is performed in accordance with system parameters such as normal load damping on the bearing and the natural frequency of the shaft system related to the stick slip motion at the shaft bearing interface in addition stick slip nonlinear friction induced vibration is reproduced with a test unit that can simulate stick slip nonlinear friction induced vibrationof the propulsion shaft of the ship we attempt to how the stick slip vibration is identified using signal processing of the test unit acceleration keywords friction induced vibration stern tube bearing stick slip 1 introduction generally a ship propulsion shaft is supported by a water lubricant stern tube bearing in marine applications the stern tube bearing is usually made of polymer and rubber when the speed of the shaft is sufficiently high a well developed lubricant film can be established however when the speed is low and the load at the bearing is high the lubricating film could break down this failure of the lubricating film usually occurs when the coefficient curve of speed versus friction has a negative slope under these conditions a stick slip process can occur between the propulsion shaft and stern tube bearing when this kind of stick slip process occurs the propulsion shaft becomes unstable and nonlinear friction induced vibration can occur therefore many studies have been conducted regarding nonlinear friction induced vibration at the water lubricant stern tube bearing simpson and ibrahim 1996 made a mechanical model of the stern tube bearing and the shaft with a two dof degree of freedom nonlinear system and approximated it to linear system using taylor series expansion they estimated that the self excited nonlinear vibration caused by the instability of the system on the shaft bearing interface could occur when the stick slip nonlinear motion occurred zhang et al 2014a 2014b investigated the stability and dynamics of a propeller shaft system that induced a nonlinear friction force on the shaft bearing contact interface they modeled the shaft bearing system with two dof which means that the shaft considered only rotating and bearing forces suggesting stable conditions of the shaft bearing system that do not cause stick slip vibrations with respect to the shaft rotating speed bhushan 1980 investigated the stick slip induced noise in a water lubricating rubber bearing through laboratory experiments he created a facility that could measure the chattering and squealing sounds of the water lubricating rubber bearing under varying conditions of normal load on the bearing shaft speed roughness of the bearing surface and solid lubricating as a result he defined the occurrence regime of chattering and squealing noises at the bearing surface under various conditions peng et al 2012 measured the friction coefficient of a water lubricated rubber stern tube bearing in a test facility varying the temperature and pressure of water in the clearance between the shaft and the bearing he found that the dynamic friction coefficient and the squealing noise occurrence regime varied according to the temperature and pressure of water in the clearance albers and herbst 1998 defined the characteristics of the chattering noise in the clutch disc and found that it could be caused by self induced as well as pressure induced chattering he found that the self induced chattering was caused by a friction coefficient change with regard to the slip speed which is highly related to the stick slip motion in the shaft bearing interface furthermore pressure induced chattering is the result of an outside impulse source with periodic excitation because stick slip vibration can cause a wearing problem for the rubber and composite bearing the nonlinear friction induced vibration with respect to the wearing has been studied hirani and verma 2009 zhimin et al 2015 wang et al 2017 in the present study the mechanism of nonlinear stick slip friction induced vibration is investigated with a two dof simple rotating model moreover stick slip nonlinear vibration is reproduced using a test unit that can simulate the vibration of the propulsion shaft rotating on the water lubricating bearing in addition an experimental diagnosis of the stick slip friction induced vibration is suggested using envelop analysis through experiments with this test unit 2 theory since it is very difficult to describe the exact motion of the real propulsion shaft suffering to the stick slip motion an approximated simple model is commonly used to explain the mechanism of the stick slip nonlinear friction induced vibration 1 3 therefore assuming that the propulsion shaft and water lubricating stern tube bearing can be simply modeled with two dof as shown in fig 1 the equation of its motion can be derived as shown in eq 1 1 i θ c t θ k t θ f r 0 μ d n r 0 m q c q k q f μ d n where i is the mass of inertia of the shaft θ is the angular displacement of the bearing c t is the torsional damping of the shaft k t is the torsional stiffness of the shaft m is the mass of the bearing c is the damping of the bearing k is the stiffness of the bearing f is the friction force r 0 is the radius of the shaft μ d is the friction coefficient of the shaft bearing interface and n is the normal load acting on the bearing surface in eq 1 the friction coefficient on the interface of bearing and shaft varies according to the shaft rotating speed as shown in fig 2 when the shaft speed versus the friction coefficient curve has a negative slope the friction force can make the total damping coefficient of the shaft and bearing negative and the vibration displacements of the system cannot be converged therefore self excited vibration can seriously occur because the shaft bearing system becomes unstable the friction coefficient can be represented by eq 2 simpson and ibrahim 1996 when the shaft speed versus friction coefficient curve has a negative slope as shown in fig 2 2 μ d x μ 0 μ 1 μ 0 e a x here μ 1 and μ 0 are the static and dynamic coefficients of friction respectively and a is a constant defining θ and q are defined as the angular and linear displacements of the shaft and bearing respectively when the vibration disappears under steady state conditions they can be respectively represented by eqs 3

vibrating conditions of bearing and shaft f s is the friction force under steady state conditions without vibration of bearing and shaft when the slope of the shaft speed and friction coefficient

shown in eq 11 11 f a a q r 0 θ therefore the equations of motion in eq 6 can be rewritten as shown in eqs 12 and 13 12 θ 2 ζ t ω t r 0 2 a a i θ r 0 a a i t q ω t 2 θ 0 q 2 ζ ω n a a m q r 0 a a i θ

1 2 3 4 in eq 20 when the real part of the eigen value a 1 a 2 is positive the displacements of the shaft and bearing θ q diverge over time and as self excited friction induced vibration occurs due to stick slip motion at the shaft bearing interface therefore the real parts of all solutions should be negative in order to prohibit self excited friction induced vibration which means that c1 c4 in eqs 16 19 should be positive based on these criteria the difference between the static and the dynamic friction coefficient should be satisfied with eqs 21 23 in order to maintain a stable state when

introduced in which the vibration estimated to be caused by stick slip motion between shaft and bearing occurs at the water lubricated stern tube bearing of a ship fig 3 shows the propulsion shaft systems described in this section within which the stick slip friction induced vibration in the water lubricated stern tube bearing occurred during the ship trial test in the propulsion shaft of the ship fig 3 the chatter sound occurred at particular rpm ranges of the propulsion shaft n rpm in order to find out whether this chatter sound was caused by stick slip friction induced vibration accelerometers pcb type 352c03 were installed at the hull near the stern tube bearing and an envelope analysis was conducted for these signals envelop analysis is widely used to determine whether some high frequency broadband noise is modulated with a specific frequency or not for diagnosis of bearing faults gear faults propeller cavitation etc in the bearing the friction force vibrates in the high and broadband frequency ranges furthermore it modulates with the shaft rotating frequency and its harmonics therefore when the envelop analysis is performed for the noise and vibration signal in the bearing housing or an adjacent structure under a normal friction state the peak signal frequencies of the envelop spectrum are revealed at the rotating frequency and its harmonics in ship applications the noise and vibration in the bearing housing or adjacent structures caused by friction can also by modulated by the propeller blade passing frequency this happens because the alternating trust load acts eccentrically with respect to the shaft rotating center and creates an alternating bending moment and its resultant normal load on the bearing surface as referred to in the previous section the system can be unstable when the slope of the friction coefficient versus the speed curve is negative and the stick slip motion can occur in the shaft bearing interface when the stick slip nonlinear vibration occurs this high and broadband noise and vibration on the bearing housing or its adjacent structure is modulated with particular natural frequencies of the bearing system as well as the shaft rotating frequency and its harmonics therefore a normal friction problem and a stick slip nonlinear vibration problem can be distinguished by whether the envelop spectrum on the bearing housing or its adjacent structure has its peak at the natural frequency and its harmonics the analytic signal of the envelop analysis is obtained from eq 24 and the enveloped signal is the amplitude of the analytic signal as shown in eq 25 10 24 h ˆ t h t j h t 25 h ˆ t h t 2 h t 2 0 5 where h t is the time signal of the raw data and h t is the hilbert transform of h t as shown in eq 26 26 h t h h t 1 π h t d t τ t when the fft analysis is performed with the envelop signal of eq 25 the modulated frequency can be identified in order to measure the acceleration on the bearing housing and ship structure for the shaft system in fig 3 the bruel kjaer type 3560bdata acquisition system was used when the envelop analysis was performed for the measured accelerations the band pass filter was set to 6 4 3 2 khz fig 4 shows the time signal of the acceleration on the hull adjacent to the stern tube bearing at n 40 and n rpm of the propulsion shaft in fig 4 a it can be seen that the acceleration is stable over time when the rotating speed is n 40 rpm however when it increases to n rpm it remains stable at first but after 25s it increases and changes irregularly over time as shown in fig 4 b fig 5 shows the contour diagram of fft spectra for acceleration versus time in fig 4 for the military security the value of the x axis is not shown when the shaft rpm is n 40 rpm only small peaks at shaft rotational frequency and the second harmonic of the br blade passing frequency exist in the contour diagram of fft spectra as shown in fig 5 a when the shaft s rpm increases to n rpm the acceleration at the particular natural frequency of the bearing f n hz and its harmonics as well as the br were dominant as shown in fig 5 b in addition the high frequency broadband vibration increases to over 500 hz as shown in fig 5 c in fig 5 the vibration at the br in the fft spectrum could be estimated to occur from the vibratory normal load at the bearing surface caused by the alternating bending moment induced by an off centered trust force of the propeller due to the eccentric axial wake distribution meanwhile accelerations at f n hz and its harmonics may not be estimated to be caused by the external force but by self excited vibration from stick slip nonlinear friction induced vibration in order to verify this hypothesis an envelope analysis of the hull s acceleration at n and n 40 rpm is performed with a bruel kjaer pulse envelop module as shown in fig 6 in order to evaluate whether this extreme vibration and the chatter noise of the propulsion shaft system was caused by stick slip friction induced vibration or not here the value of the x axis is not shown for the military security in fig 6 a the envelop spectrum peaks at the pole passing frequency f s hz of the electric motor and its harmonics appear without peaks at br and the natural frequency of the bearing the peak signal at the pole passing frequency of the electric motor and its harmonics is revealed in the envelop spectrum because the vibration of the second harmonics of the inverter switching frequency 9 khz is strong at this rpm and it is modulated with the pole passing frequency of the electric motor and its harmonics even though some peaks are revealed in envelop spectrum there is no vibration issue at n 40 rpm when increasing the shaft rpm to n the peak components at the natural frequency of the bearing f n hz and its harmonics are revealed through the envelop spectrum it can be known that the friction induced vibration with high and broadband frequency is modulated with the natural frequency of the bearing and its harmonics since acceleration signals at natural frequencies of the bearing shaft system are revealed well when the stick slip nonlinear friction induced noise occurs it can be strongly estimated that the extreme vibration and chatter noise in the shaft system for the practical case described in this section is caused by stick slip nonlinear friction induced vibration in order to verify more accurately that the practical vibration problem described in this section was caused by stick slip nonlinear vibration a test unit that can simulate the stick slip friction induced vibration on the water lubricated bearing was developed in order to reproduce the practical stick slip vibration problem discussed in this section 4 verification of the vibration occurring mechanism from stick slip in this section the experiment to reproduce stick slip nonlinear friction induced vibration occurring at the interface between shaft and water lubricated bearing is described the test unit to simulate the propulsion shaft applying a water lubricated bearing is manufactured and the test results using this test unit are investigated with theoretical results with respect to the stick slip nonlinear friction induced vibration in addition the test procedure is suggested to define whether the vibration of the shaft bearing system is caused by stick slip motion or not using an envelope analysis for the acceleration on the ship structure 4 1 test unit in order to simulate the stick slip nonlinear friction induced vibration that occurs in the water lubricated bearing of propulsion shaft for a ship a test unit was manufactured fig 7 and the detailed specifications are shown in table 1 as shown in fig 7 the water pump supplies lubricating water to the bearing in a water tank the normal force subjected to the bearing can be controlled by the lever installed under the foundation jig supporting the bearing this force can be measured by the load cell installed between the lever and foundation jig 4 2 stick slip producing regime in the regime where the friction coefficient is reduced with increasing shaft speed on the stribeck curve fig 2 stick slip nonlinear friction vibration can occur in this regime the occurrence of stick slip vibration is closely related to the friction coefficient of the bearing therefore the friction coefficient of a typical water lubricated bearing manufactured by thordon with xl material is measured according to the shaft speed normal load pressure of the water temperature and diametric clearance the bearing tested is shown in fig 8 the inner diameter of the bearing is 60 mm and its minimum diametric clearance is 0 3 mm according to the manufacturer s recommendation in their user manual in this study the bearing is manufactured such that the diametric clearances are 0 3 0 5 and 0 7 mm respectively in the test the friction coefficient can be estimated by eqs 27 and 28 27 t n t 0 μ d t f n 28 μ d t t n t 0 f n here μ d t is the friction coefficient of the bearing at time t t 0 is the torque of the shaft when the bearing is not installed t n is the torque of the shaft when the bearing is installed f n is the normal force applied on the bearing in eqs 27 28 the torque can be measured with the shear strain gauge mm model cea 06 250us 350 and telemetry system binsfeld model tt 10k lp installed on the shaft measured friction coefficients for the bearing with 0 3 0 5 and 0 7 mm clearances are shown in fig 9 when the normal load applied on the bearing is 600 n in fig 9 the friction coefficient is gradually decreased as the speed increases up to 800 rpm but there is no significant change over 800 rpm in the regime where the friction coefficient is decreased as the speed increases stick slip nonlinear friction induced vibration can occur considering that the diameter of the shaft is 60 mm the linear velocity on the bearing surface at 800 rpm is calculated to be 2 5 m s this speed can be regarded as the maximum speed at which stick slip vibration can occur compared with previous studies performed by y zhimin et al 2015 the maximum speed at which stick slip vibration can occur is similar in fig 9 the friction coefficient under 400 rpm for the bearing with a 0 3 mm clearance is higher than that for the bearings with 0 5 and 0 7 mm clearances therefore it can be determined that stick slip vibration may occur more easily when the clearance is 0 3 mm than when the clearance is 0 5 or 0 7 mm fig 10 shows the friction coefficient variations with respect to increasing temperature as measured with the bearings with 0 3 and 0 7 mm clearances respectively when the normal force on the bearing is 400 n in fig 10 the friction coefficient of the bearing with a 0 7 mm clearance does not varied sufficiently when the temperature of the lubricating water is increased from 27 to 47 1 c however the friction coefficient of the bearing with a 0 3 mm clearance increased sufficiently when the temperature of the lubricating water increased from 25 to 43 2 c from the test results it can be estimated that the thermal expansion caused by the friction on the bearing may make the clearance smaller than the minimum clearance suggested by the manufacturer when the clearance of the bearing was 0 3 mm therefore it can be estimated that the minimum limit of the bearing clearance suggested by manufacturer may be somewhat disadvantageous with respect to the stick slip friction induced vibration fig 11 shows the variation of the friction force as increasing pressure of the lubricating water from 0 1 to 0 45 mpa when the normal force on the bearing is 400 n and the rotating speed of the shaft is 400 rpm in fig 11 it can be found that the friction force increase with increasing water pressure when the pressure is applied to the lubricant fluid the velocity of the fluid flow on bottom side in the clearance is faster than that on the top side considering bernoulli s theory the pressure on the bottom side should be lower than that on the top side consequently the net force caused by fluid pressure applies on the bearing in the bottom direction therefore when the fluid pressure increased the net normal and friction force on the bearing also increased considering that submarines are sailing at deep water with high static pressure the stick slip nonlinear vibration appears to be more likely to occur in submarines rather than in surface ships because the friction force also increases as the pressure increases 4 3 stability evaluation in order to evaluate the stability of the test unit a theoretical analysis was performed with mechanical properties of the test unit as shown in table 2 here the mass of the bearing system is regarded to be the mass of the test unit 500 kgf and the mass moment of the inertia of the shaft is calculated with the shaft diameter 60 mm length 500 mm installed in the test unit since the damping ratio cannot be defined accurately it is assumed that the damping ratio of the shaft is 0 005 and that of the bearing is 0 005 0 05 the result for the stability of the system from the theoretical analysis is shown in fig 12 in fig 12 a it can be seen that the test unit becomes unstable when the speed of the shaft is lower than 100 rpm and the normal force on the bearing is 500 n under these conditions when the normal load increased to 1000 n and 2000n the speed limit at which the system becomes unstable increases to 250 rpm and 550 rpm respectively in fig 12 b when the natural frequency of the shaft system increases from 12 5 hz to 400 hz while the normal load on the bearing is fixed at 2000n it can be seen that the speed limit where the system is unstable is reduced from 550 rpm to 80 rpm fig 12 c shows the variation of the speed limit where the system is unstable according to the damping ratio of the bearing when the damping ratio is increased from 0 005 to 0 05 the speed limit where the system is unstable is reduced from 550 to 250 rpm when the normal force on the bearing is 2000n when the motion of the test unit becomes unstable the vibratory displacement of the system diverged and self excited vibration occurred at natural frequencies and harmonics for the shaft bearing system in order to verify the results of the stability analysis experimentally the characteristics of the vibration on the test unit are evaluated under the various condition at which the stick slip can occur 4 4 test results accelerations were measured on the motor base with 3 axis accelerometer pcb type 356a02 as shown in fig 13 in order to verify that the shaft bearing system of the test unit becomes unstable at the regime defined theoretically in the previous section here the accelerations are measured in longitudinal x axis lateral y axis and vertical direction z axis when the shaft speed is changed from 50 to 800 rpm fig 14 shows the time signal of acceleration in vertical direction on the motor base at 100 rpm and 800 rpm since the patterns of the measured acceleration are similar regardless of the direction of measurement the measured acceleration in the vertical direction is only shown in this section when the shaft speed is 100 rpm time signals of acceleration increase abnormally according to the time when the normal force is increased to 2000n as shown in fig 14 a however when the shaft speed is 800 rpm time signals of acceleration do not vary with time when the normal force is increased to 2000n as shown in fig 14 b these patterns of the signals are similar to those of the signals for the particular ship described in section 3 fig 4 fig 15 shows the contour diagram of the fft spectra of the acceleration on the motor base when the normal force on the bearing is increased from 0 to 2000n then maintained at 2000n in fig 15 there is no dominant acceleration signal except at the rotational frequency and its harmonics when the normal force on the bearing is 0 n however when the normal force is applied up to 2000n peak acceleration signals at the frequencies estimated to be the natural frequencies of the test unit are revealed regardless of shaft speed fig 15 when the shaft speed is in the range of 50 200 rpm under these conditions the acceleration components at the rotational frequency and its harmonics do not appear clearly because the revolution speed of the shaft is sufficiently changed by the friction force variation when the shaft speed increased to 800 rpm in fig 15 it can be seen that the variation of the acceleration in the fft spectrum is not large even though the normal force is increased up to 2000n when the impact test is performed and the frequency response function is investigated natural frequencies of the test unit can be known as shown in fig 16 here it can be known that frequencies of the peak values in fig 15 when the shaft rpm is 50 400 rpm are well coincident with natural frequencies measured in fig 16 considering that the peak component at the natural frequency of the shaft bearing system and its harmonics in the fft spectra reveal well when the stick slip nonlinear vibration occurs it can be estimated that stick slip nonlinear friction induced vibration occurs when the speed of the shaft is lower than 400 rpm as described in the previous section when stick slip friction induced vibration occurs vibration components caused by the friction occur in the broadband high frequency range in fft spectra and they are modulated by natural frequencies of the system as well as rotational and harmonic frequencies in order to find out whether the friction induced vibration is modulated by natural frequencies of the test unit or not envelop analysis is performed with the acceleration on the motor base under various operating conditions of the test unit prior to performing envelop analysis the bandpass filter should be selected and applied to the raw signal here the frequency band of the bandpass filter should include an increasing frequency range given the occurrence of friction induced vibration fig 17 is the fft spectrum of the acceleration on the motor mount of the test unit when the normal force is not applied on the bearing and when a 2000n force is applied on the bearing here the bearing clearance is 0 3 mm as shown in fig 17 the acceleration at the frequency range centered at 6 khz increases significantly when the normal force is applied on the bearing therefore this frequency range is considered to be the frequency band that is most affected by the friction induced vibration consequently the frequency band of the band pass filter for the envelop analysis is set to 6 3 2 khz fig 18 shows the contour diagram of the envelop spectra of the acceleration on the motor base in the vertical direction fig 16 after applying the bandpass filter selected from fig 17 in fig 18 the patterns of the envelop spectrum when the shaft speed is lower than 200 rpm are different than those at 400 rpm when the shaft speed is lower than 200 rpm and the normal force applied is 2000n peaks in the envelop spectrum at the natural frequencies of the test unit as well as their harmonics are significant when the shaft speed is lower than 200 rpm the peaks at the shaft rotational frequency and its harmonics do not seem obvious but it seems to spread these phenomena are typical characteristics of stick slip motion however when the shaft speed increases to 800 rpm only the peaks at the shaft rotational frequency and its harmonics are obvious and no peaks are seen at the natural frequencies of the test unit in addition there is no variation in the envelop spectra when a normal load of 2000n is applied therefore it can be noted that there is no stick slip motion at 800 rpm considering the stability analysis described in fig 12 c in the previous section it can be asserted that the test results agree with the theoretical stability analysis when fig 18 a c are compared to fig 6 b it can be seen that the shape and pattern of the envelop spectra of the test unit in which stick slip friction induced vibration occurs are similar to that of the practical case described in section 3 fig 19 shows the envelop spectrum of the acceleration on the motor base in the vertical direction when the shaft rotating speed is 100 rpm and the temperature of the lubricating water is changed to 35 c warm initially the temperature of water is 25 c cold and during this time the envelop spectrum is as shown in fig 18 b in fig 19 the normal force is increased gradually from 0 to 2000n then the normal force is maintained at 2000n as in fig 18 as described in section 4 2 the friction coefficient of the bearing with a 0 3 mm clearance is increased at low rpm when the temperature of the lubricating water increases when the friction coefficient increases the possibility of stick slip motion also increases however as shown in fig 19 peaks at natural frequencies and their harmonics as well as those at shaft rotating frequencies and their harmonics in the envelop spectrum are reduced when the temperature of the lubricating water increases despite this increase in the friction coefficient with respect to increasing temperature the damping of the bearing may also increase with respect to increasing temperature therefore it can be estimated from fig 19 that the slick slip nonlinear friction induced vibration is reduced when the temperature of the lubricating water of the bearing is increased due to increased damping of the bearing in addition envelop analysis was performed as shown in fig 20 for the acceleration on the motor base in the vertical direction when the shaft rotating speed was 100 rpm and the normal force was 2000n according to applying a rigid mount on the motor this test was performed in order to determine the variation of stick slip friction induced vibration according to increasing natural frequencies of the shaft bearing system when comparing fig 18 b to fig 20 similar to the results from theoretical analysis performed in section 4 3 almost all peeks in the envelop spectrum disappear when the natural frequency of the test unit increases from rigid mount installation for the motor therefore it can be estimated that the stick slip friction induced vibration can be avoided by increasing natural frequencies of the bearing shaft system when the shaft is misaligned the normal force on a certain bearing can be increased in this case slick slip friction induced vibration can occur at the shaft speed range where the friction coefficient is decreased according to increasing shaft rpm in this case the stick slip friction induced vibration can disappear by improving the alignment conditions of the shaft considering that the stick slip nonlinear friction induced vibration problem described in section 3 was dissipated by changing the rubber coupling it can be estimated that the stick slip friction induced vibration disappeared given the variation of the alignment conditions of the shaft similar to the results in fig 20 through the vibration test results with test units that simulate the propulsion shaft system of the naval vessel it can be confidently estimated that the vibration problem described in section 3 was caused by stick slip friction induced vibration in addition the theoretical investigation of stick slip friction induced vibration according to the variation of normal force bearing damping and natural frequencies can be reproduced by experiments and the evaluation method of friction induced vibration is proposed whether the peaks in natural frequencies of the test unit and its harmonics are present in the envelop spectrum or not 5 conclusion chattering noise caused by stick slip nonlinear friction induced vibration at the water lubricated stern tube bearing frequently occurs in ship applications in this study the mechanism of stick slip motion in a shaft bearing interface is suggested by a rotating model with two dof furthermore through reproducing a real case of stick slip nonlinear friction induced vibration with the test unit that simulates the vibration of the propulsion shaft of a naval vessel following conclusions can be obtained a stick slip nonlinear vibration can occur at the unstable condition in which the real part of the eigen value becomes positive and this condition can occur when the friction coefficient is decreased with respect to increasing shaft rotating speed b when the revolution speed of the test unit is lower than 800 rpm the lubricating condition becomes boundary and mixed lubricating condition as shown in fig 2 therefore it can be known that the shaft speed range where the stick slip friction vibration can occur is under 800 rpm for the test unit c when the normal force is increased on the bearing for the test unit stick slip nonlinear friction induced vibration can occur more easily and it is well coincident with estimation results by theoretical model d when the natural frequencies of the bearing and its supporting structure of the test unit by increasing stiffness of it the stick slip nonlinear friction induced vibration can be decreased and it is well coincident with estimation results by theoretical model e when the damping of the bearing increases the stick slip nonlinear friction induced vibration is reduced and it is well coincident with estimation results by theoretical model f comparing the envelop spectrum of the acceleration measured in the real case described in section 3 2 to that at the test unit which reproduces the stick slip friction induced vibration it can be seen that the pattern of the envelop spectrum as well as fft spectrum are very similar to each other it can be concluded that the vibration problems in the real cases described in section 3 2 are caused by stick slip nonlinear vibration in addition through experiments with the test unit that simulate stick slip friction induced vibration for a water lubricated bearing the characteristics of the vibration signal of the propulsion shaft system can be identified according to the system conditions as follows a normal friction induced vibration under stable conditions accelerations at the high and broadband frequency range can be detected in the fft spectrum on the bearing and shaft system in the envelop spectrum of the acceleration on the bearing and shaft system there are no peaks except for some components related to the shaft rotating frequency acceleration signals at the shaft rotating frequency and its harmonics on the fft and envelop spectrums are obvious b abnormal friction induced vibration under unstable conditions accelerations at the natural frequency of the propulsion shaft system and its harmonics as well as accelerations at high and broadband frequency range can be detected in the fft spectrum of the bearing and shaft system in the envelop spectrum of the acceleration on the bearing and shaft system peak signals at the natural frequencies of the propulsion shaft system and its harmonics can be detected acceleration signals at the shaft rotating frequency and its harmonics on the fft and envelop spectrums do not reveal obvious peaks but rather spread out signals since the vibratory torque from the friction force is varied by stick slip motion acknowledgment this research was performed in the defense agency for technology and quality and dtaq verified that it did not contain any information related to military security 
22798,unmanned system has become more and more popular as it can adapt to diverse environments and has prospective applications especially the coordination among heterogeneous vehicles is capable of completing complicated tasks which is often beyond the ability of homogeneous vehicles in this paper the underwater target strike mission is concentrated and the mission is completed by the coordination between a uaav and an auv uaav and auv are deployed in this mission because uaav has strong search ability in air and can communicate with auv directly after it dives into water firstly to decompose the problem the mission is divided into two phases i e single flying of uaav and underwater coordination between uaav and auv in the coordinated path planning model the motion of vehicles the constraints in different media and the optimization index in each phase are all formulated into mathematical forms based on the particle swarm optimization pso algorithm the collocation points are used to determine the locations of control variables those points can reduce the computation load and improve the solution quality and they are distributed by height and moment according to the forms of constraints in each phase besides the strategy of addressing infeasible solutions is generated to guarantee the normal operation of pso based algorithm simulation results demonstrate that the proposed two phase coordinated path planning method can generate coordinated paths and the obtained results is very close to the optimal solution in theory compared to the whole method the two phase method can better deal with the complicated constraints in each phase keywords unmanned system unmanned aerial aquatic vehicle autonomous underwater vehicle coordinated path planning particle swarm optimization algorithm 1 introduction unmanned system is now becoming more common as it can complete complicated missions without human intervention unmanned system is made up by a certain number of vehicles and can be applied in detection surveillance and strike mission wang and liu 2012 the system is usually consisted of unmanned aerial vehicles uavs unmanned ground vehicles ugvs unmanned surface vehicles usvs and autonomous underwater vehicles auvs according to the types of vehicles the unmanned system can be classified into two categories i e homogeneous system and heterogeneous system in a homogeneous system the vehicles are with the same type and they execute specific tasks in a single environment for example uavs execute transportation task in air quintero et al 2016 and usvs conduct rescue task on the water surface kim et al 2017 however as there are more and more complicated tasks crossing multiple areas homogeneous system may be incapable of finishing such tasks compared to homogeneous system heterogeneous system contains different types of vehicles which enable it to cope with the cooperative tasks crossing multiple areas such as air sea surveillance air ground target track and communications relay minaeian et al 2016 murphy et al 2008 in this paper the underwater target strike mission is focused on and a uaav and an auv are equipped to complete the mission cooperatively uaav is a new type of aircraft that can navigate both in the air and underwater and the introduction of uuav extends the scope of mission and makes the task completed more efficiently yang et al 2015 in existing literature coordination in homogeneous system and heterogeneous system are both studied in homogeneous system coordination among uavs is the main concern and the task assignment and coordinated path planning problem are widely studied task assignment is a combinatorial optimization problem and uavs are usually assigned more than one task during the whole process in ref luitpold 2018 a group of uavs are required to arrive at the destinations simultaneously or sequentially with specified time delays and the goal is to minimize the total mission time to deal with the problem the algorithm for simultaneous arrival was presented firstly to calculate the shortest flight paths between all pairs of uavs and targets then an optimal assignment and a critical path are found by solving a linear bottleneck assignment problem and the other paths are prolonged to the length of the critical path by insertion in ref ma et al 2018 the coordinated motion planning problem for a team of micro aerial vehicles with high density is paid attention to the problem was solved by the proposed decentralized motion planning method in high level planning a prioritized algorithm was combined and in low level trajectory generation and vehicle control the coordination strategy was based on barrier functions other studies regarding homogeneous coordination are among ugvs or auvs the coordinated path planning problem for carrier aircraft taxiing on flight deck is essentially a ugvs coordination problem and a distributed planning architecture with multiple levels is proposed in ref wu et al 2018 under this planning architecture realistic constraints are modeled and a distributed path planning algorithm based on the asynchronous planning strategy is developed to avoid the conflict during taxi as for auvs the underwater target tracking problem is focused on considering the tracking control problem for unknown autonomous marine vehicles amvs with uncertainties and disturbances a novel data driven adaptive tracking controller is designed based on the established equivalent data model of the amv and the stability analysis for the closed loop amv system is also presented weng et al 2018 the performance of coordination algorithm also has impact on the operation of auvs system in ref xing et al 2017 the convergence analysis on multi auv system with leader follower architecture is conducted a graph theory model based on second order consensus protocol is introduced the contributions on enhancing the convergence rate are discussed especially for the influences of control gains network topology and topologies imposed on the proposed collaborative navigation algorithm coordination in heterogeneous system is often seen between uav and other types of vehicle there are strong complementarities between uav and ugv and the advantages are summarized as follows chen et al 2015 minaeian et al 2015 firstly ugv can be deployed to accurately locate ground targets to make up for the weakness of sensors located on uav limited by operating airspeed and altitude secondly uav can be regarded as communication relay as it is less blocked by obstacles than that among ugvs finally ugv have larger payload capability and longer voyage than uav in a transportation task in ref li et al 2016 a uav is used to obtain a ground image from aerial vision which is beneficial for constructing the ground map and improving the recognition accuracy of obstacles then a hybrid path planning algorithm combining global path planning with local rolling optimization is proposed to optimize the planned path the coordination between uav and usv is similar to that between uav and ugv and the uav usv system has been applied in sea rescue and marine pollution clearance murphy et al 2010 in ref ramirez et al 2011 a coordinated system for rescuing people at sea was proposed taking advantage of the high speed and sensing capability of a searching uav and the computer power and load capability of a rescuing usv in ref jung et al 2017 an algal bloom removal robotic system is proposed auv is responsible for removing the algal bloom and to improve the work efficiency a uav is utilized to detect algal blooms with an image based detection algorithm uav and auv are deployed for underwater exploration task as they work in different media they can not communicate with each other once the auv is tasked faria et al 2014 to deal with the constraints in communication three strategies i e periodic coordination shortest route coordination and probabilistic coordination are proposed in ref sujit and saripalli 2013 and the goal is to maximize the explored area while minimizing the idle time of uav and auv comparisons are conducted to analyze the characteristic of each strategy another typical heterogeneous system is composed of auv and usv which is applied in disaster assessment and sea rescue bingham et al 2008 for the underwater target strike mission discussed in this paper both homogeneous and heterogeneous system can deal with this problem but there are still some weak points when auvs are deployed to execute this task they lack of global search ability and it may cost a lot of time searching the target li et al 2017 as for the uav auv system communication from air to underwater and from underwater to air is forbidden because the gps signal is easy to be detected which makes auv unsafe barbarino et al 2011 to solve the above problems a uaav auv system is developed in this system uaav can search the underwater target in air and send the information to auv after the uaav has dived into water thus both improving the work efficiency and ensuring the safety of vehicles a new coordinated path planning model for a uaav and an auv is proposed in this paper and an effective particle swarm optimization pso based algorithm is also developed to solve the established model the main contributions of this work can be concluded as follows 1 the coordinated path planning problem for a uaav and an auv in an underwater target strike mission is described the mission is divided into two phases i e single flying of uaav and underwater coordination between uaav and auv the superiority of the two phase division is verified by comparing with treating the task as a whole process 2 the coordinated path planning model is established in this model the maneuverability of uaav in different media is taken into account and the constraints on communication safe distance and coordinated strike are all included besides the optimization indexes considering different goals of each phase are proposed 3 the pso based algorithm is developed in this algorithm chebyshev polynomials are introduced to combine with pso algorithm the locations of control variables optimized in pso algorithm are determined by chebyshev collocation points those points are distributed according to the form of constraints in each phase which matches well with the established model with this algorithm the solution which is very close to the theoretical optimal one can be obtained 2 description of the underwater target strike mission the underwater target strike mission specified in this paper is defined as follows uaav initially flies in air with high speed to search for the underwater target quickly and auv keeps static before receiving any command once uaav has discovered the underwater target it will dive into water and communicate with auv the position information of underwater target will be sent to auv then uaav and auv compute the coordinated paths head for the target and hit it simultaneously according to the above description the mission can be divided into two phases as shown in fig 1 uaav carrying the position information of underwater target dives into water to communicate with auv in this phase uaav flies without considering the position of underwater target when uaav is underwater and gets in touch with auv this phase ends 2 underwater coordination between uaav and auv after the position information of underwater target has been sent to auv uaav and auv navigate coordinately to hit the target simultaneously they hit the target from different directions because it can maximize the damage and gain the possibility of success the advantages of dividing the mission into two phases can be concluded as follows 1 in the whole mission there are various constraints in different media it is difficult to obtain feasible paths for vehicles all at once satisfying all of constraints therefore decentralization is a good way to address the constraints separately 2 as uaav navigates both in air and underwater the goals of navigating in different media may not the same a unified optimization index can not reflect the real objective of each phase and has a bad influence on the efficiency of completing the mission 3 mathematical model of coordinated path planning for a uaav and an auv the underwater target strike mission has been divided into two phases in this section the motion and maneuverability of uaav and auv in different media are depicted firstly then the constraints in each phase are set to ensure the success of communication the safety of vehicles and the success of strike mission finally optimization indexes reflecting the demand of each phase are proposed to make the goals clear 3 1 kinetic model and the maneuverability of vehicles in a path planning problem the vehicle is usually treated as a particle and a particle motion model including the particle dynamic model and the particle kinetic model is used even in some literature only the particle kinetic model is considered shen et al 2016 this is because compared to control module path planning module is an outer loop to provide the command signal which requires a fast computation speed for a rigid body the motion model is a set of nonlinear differential equations with variable coefficients it will cost much time to solve such complicated equations and it is the duty of control system to deal with the problem in a coordinated path planning problem only the kinetic model of vehicles are taken into account in existing studies to save more time for computing on coordination cui et al 2017 zhu et al 2013 besides uaav is a new type of vehicle and a completed dynamic model for a submersible uaav has not been reported so far and only wind and water tunnel testing are conducted to obtain the dynamic characteristics siddall et al 2017 in view of the above reasons the particle kinetic models of uaav and auv are used in this study in the ground frame the sea level is defined as the plane xoy and the axis oz is vertically downward to obey the right hand rule the particle kinetic model of uaav and auv under the kinetic frame is presented as follows 1 x v c o s θ c o s φ y v c o s θ s i n φ z v s i n θ θ q φ r v a where x y z and v are the position and velocity of vehicle θ and φ are the pitch angle and the yaw angle and q and r are the angular rates correspondingly a is the acceleration of vehicle note that a subscript u or a can be added to the above variables to denote the states of uaav and auv respectively in eq 1 the control variable is defined as u q r a t and the state variable is x x y z v θ φ t the motion of vehicle can be calculated according to eq 1 after the value of control variable is determined maneuverability is an important index to reflect the ability of changing velocity height and motion direction for a vehicle the constraints on the maneuverability of vehicle must be met or the obtained path is unfeasible here the constraints on q r and a are listed below 2 q u q u m a x a r u r u m a x a a u a u m a x a z u 0 3 q u q u m a x w r u r u m a x w a u a u m a x w z u 0 4 q a q a m a x r a r a m a x a a a a m a x eqs 2 and 3 are the constraints considering the maneuverability of uaav in different media and eq 4 contains the constraints of control variables for auv 3 2 constraints in each phase of strike mission in the coordinated path planning model the state of uaav and auv must obey specific constraints to ensure the safety of vehicles and the success of strike mission those constraints can be concluded as follows 1 constrains for single flying of uaav when uaav flies its velocity is limited within a certain range according to different media because of its flight performance which is determined by vehicle design and flight environment especially the velocity near the water surface must be small enough to alleviate the disturbance because a big impact may have a bad influence on the motion stability of uaav lock et al 2010 the constraints on velocity of uaav in different media and near the water surface can be presented in eqs 5 and 6 5 0 v u v u m a x a z u 0 0 v u v u m a x w z u 0 6 v u v u c r i z u z u c r i where v u m a x a and v u m a x w and the maximum velocity in air and water respectively and v u c r i and z u c r i are the maximum permitting velocity near the water surface and the critical distance from uaav to the water surface as the communication between uaav and auv is made underwater to ensure the safety uaav must be underwater and within the communication range of auv at the end of this phase this constraint can be expressed in eq 7 7 z u t f 1 0 x u t f 1 x a t f 1 2 y u t f 1 y a t f 1 2 z u t f 1 z a t f 1 2 d c o m where t f 1 is the ending moment of phase 1 and d c o m is the maximum underwater communication distance 2 constraints for underwater coordination after uaav dives into water and sends the information regarding the target position to auv they go ahead for hitting the target cooperatively in this phase as the vehicles navigate underwater the influence of underwater terrain and submerged debris must be taken into account to ensure the navigation safety the boundary of space that the submerged debris occupies is defined as f i x d y d z d 0 i 1 p where p is the number of debris f i is the function describing the boundary of debris and x d y d z d is a point on the boundary of debris besides the height of underwater mountain can be denoted as z m h x y where z m is the height corresponding to a point x y in xoy plane and h is the function describing the underwater terrain with the above descriptions on submerged debris and underwater terrain the following constraints must be met to realize the mission goal 8 t u 2 t a 2 t f 2 9 z u t 0 z a t 0 t f 1 t t f 2 10 0 v a v a m a x 11 f i x u t y u t z u t 0 f i x a t y a t z a t 0 t f 1 t t f 2 12 h x u t y u t z u t h x a t y a t z a t t f 1 t t f 2 13 x u t x a t 2 y u t y a t 2 z u t z a t 2 d s a f e t f 1 t t f 2 14 θ u t f 2 θ a t f 2 θ m i n o r φ u t f 2 φ a t f 2 φ m i n eq 8 means the navigation time of uaav and auv must be the same to hit the target simultaneously and t f 2 is the ending moment of phase 2 eqs 9 and 10 guarantee that uaav and auv are always underwater in this phase and the velocity of auv is within a certain range according to its navigation performance the constraints of submerged debris and underwater terrain are expressed in eqs 11 and 12 respectively and note that the positive direction of axis oz is downward eq 13 denotes that the distance between uaav and auv must be greater than a minimal value expressed as d s a f e to avoid collision at last uaav and auv must hit the target from different directions to make the greatest damage this constraint is formulated into eq 14 3 3 optimization indexes of coordinated path planning the constraints of coordinated path planning problem are all expressed in their mathematical forms in chapter 3 2 the number and complexity of constraints will have an influence on the solution quality i e the value of optimization index the mathematical model with fewer constraints has a higher probability to result in good solutions besides complicated constraints which are hard to be satisfied will lead to the decrease of feasible solutions as stated earlier there are two phases in the underwater target strike mission in phase 1 only uaav is in motion and the goal is to reach the water and communicate with auv within the shortest time in phase 2 uaav and auv navigate cooperatively to complete the strike mission and they must hit the target simultaneously with the minimum terminal position error the goal of each phase can be expressed in eqs 15 and 16 respectively 15 j 1 t f 1 j 2 max x u t f 2 x t a r 2 y u t f 2 y t a r 2 z u t f 2 z t a r 2 16 x a t f 2 x t a r 2 y a t f 2 y t a r 2 z a t f 2 z t a r 2 where x t a r y t a r z t a r is the position of underwater target sometimes it can not be measured accurately and an effective method is needed to predict the real position of target which can reduce the value of optimization index in eq 16 the above separate optimization indexes reflect the real goal in each phase and avoid the inappropriate description of demand by using a unified optimization index 4 coordinated path planning based on pso algorithm to obtain the paths of uaav and auv a coordinated path planning algorithm must be developed considering the characteristic of the established model firstly the distributions of control variables in each phase are determined to make the constraints being satisfied easier and improve the solution quality then pso algorithm is applied to determine the values of control variables at chebyshev points and the strategy of dealing with the solutions violating the constraints is generated finally the procedures of coordinated path planning are presented to provide a clear explanation on solving this problem 4 1 operations on the control variables according to the kinetic model of vehicle u q r a t is the control variable in each phase actually it will cost much time if the value of control variable at every sampling moment is optimized which will reduce the efficiency of algorithm to balance the computation load and efficiency collocation points are set in each phase of mission the values of control variables at sampling points can be calculated by linear interpolation considering the characteristic of each phase the distribution modes of control variable are not the same 1 distribution of collocation points in phase 1 the height between the initial height of uaav denoted as z u t 0 and the water surface is discretized as a certain number of chebyshev points and they are the locations where the control variables are optimized the locations of chebyshev points are calculated by the following formula fahroo and ross 2000 17 z m cos n m π n m 0 1 2 n where the number of collocation points is n 1 and the two endpoints i e z u t 0 and 0 are also included z m is the height of the mth collocation point the chebyshev points are dense at both ends and sparse in the middle this feature is just suitable for meeting the terminal constraints easily that there are more control variables to be operated at the end of phase as z m 1 1 in eq 17 a conversion is needed to make the value of z m fall into the interval z u t 0 0 18 h m 0 z u t 0 2 z m 0 z u t 0 2 where h m m 0 1 n are the real height of collocation points and the values of control variables at other heights denoted as h o are obtained by linear interpolation as expressed in eq 19 19 q u h o q u h m 1 q u h m h m 1 h m h o h m q u h m r u h o r u h m 1 r u h m h m 1 h m h o h m r u h m a u h o a u h m 1 a u h m h m 1 h m h o h m a u h m h m h 0 h m 1 as it is presented in the path planning model phase 1 will end when uaav is underwater and gets in touch with the static auv the ending moment also the optimization index of phase 1 j 1 t f 1 is determined by the terminal state of uaav 2 distribution of collocation points in phase 2 in this phase the navigation time for uaav and auv is t f 2 t f 2 is free and is also regarded as a control variable to be optimized as the initial positions of uaav and auv are different it is inappropriate to discretize the collocation points by height considering that the navigation time for uaav and auv is the same it is better to distribute the chebyshev points according to different moments which makes it convenient to know the states of vehicles at any moment the formula of generating the collocation points and calculating the values of control variables are the same with those from eq 17 to eq 19 by comparison the distribution modes of collocation points are different in phase 1 and phase 2 and both modes are reasonable according to the characteristic of each phase in phase 1 it is easier to judge the height of uaav by discretizing the collocation points by height this is important because many constraints in phase 1 are set by different heights such as the constraints in eqs 2 3 5 and 6 in phase 2 both uaav and auv are underwater and the constraints in this phase are set by different moments in conclusion to make the coordinated path planning algorithm more effective the distribution mode of collocation points should be in accordance with the form of constraints 4 2 generation of feasible coordinated paths integrating pso algorithm pso is a well known swarm based optimization algorithm and has been widely applied in path planning in this problem the formulas of updating solutions in pso algorithm are used and the strategy of dealing with unfeasible solutions is designed in many previous studies each particle in pso algorithm is a collection of discrete points which presents a possible path of vehicle in this problem as the kinetic model is considered each particle represents a set of control variables and the corresponding path can be obtained by solving the kinetic equations for each particle the dimensions equal to the number of collocation points denoted as d 1 and d 2 in phase 1 and 2 respectively the scale of particle swarm i e the number of initial solutions is set as n in each phase the formulas of updating solutions are presented below 20 δ u i t ω δ u i t 1 c 1 r a n d 1 u i b t u i t c 2 r a n d 2 u g b t u i t 21 u i t 1 u i t δ u i t where u i t is the control vector of the ith particle in the tth iteration and u i b t and u g b t are the control vectors corresponding to the individual best solution and the global best solution ω is the inertia weight c 1 and c 2 are acceleration constraints and rand1 and rand2 are random number obeyed uniform distribution in interval 0 1 one times of iteration is finished after the solutions are updated according to the formulas in eqs 20 and 21 note that if any control variable in u i t 1 goes out of range it will be set to the closest threshold to ensure the normal operation of algorithm for each u i t 1 it is put into the kinetic model of vehicle to obtain the states of uaav and auv and the duration of phase 1 and the terminal state of phase 2 can be used to calculate the fitness value according to eq 15 or eq 16 respectively if the state of vehicle violates any constraint the fitness value of u i t 1 will be set to a large value to denote that the solution is infeasible and must be abandoned 4 3 procedures of solving the coordinated path planning problem the procedures of pso based algorithm solving the coordinated path planning problem for uaav and auv are shown in fig 2 in fig 2 t1 and t2 are the current iteration number in phase 1 and 2 respectively and iter is the maximum iteration times the steps in phase 1 and 2 are roughly the same compared to phase 1 there are more control variables in phase 2 the control variables are q u r u and a u in phase 1 and are q u r u a u q u r u a u and t f 2 in phase 2 and the constraints in this phase are more complicated the final optimal coordinated paths will be outputted when the maximum iterations is reached and the corresponding states of uaav and auv can be obtained by solving the kinetic model note that when using the pso algorithm in phase 1 and phase 2 there are two random numbers in eq 20 which will cause some uncertainties for example a greater value of rand1 makes the new solution refer more to the individual best solution while the global best solution is paid more attention when rand2 is larger 5 simulation studies to investigate the rationality of the established model for the underwater strike mission of uaav and auv and the validity of the proposed pso based coordinated path planning algorithm simulations under different situations are conducted in the first scenario a static underwater target is considered and the strike mission begins after the target is detected by uaav the paths of vehicles in each phase are generated by the proposed two phase method and the optimality of solution is analyzed based on the setting in the first scenario a moving underwater target with known path is taken into account in the second scenario two methods i e the two phase method and the whole method in this method the task is treated as a single process which is often used in uavs coordination problems are both applied to solve the problem and comparison is made a moving target with unknown path is considered in the third scenario and kalman filtering is used to predict its position in this scenario two methods are also used to obtain the results and comparison is conducted again note that in these simulations the time interval between two adjacent sampling moments is set to δ t 1s and the initial positions of uaav and auv are set as 2000 500 200 and 1000 100 20 respectively all the results are obtained by running the programs on a desktop with intel core i7 3370 3 40 ghz the parameters in pso algorithm are referred to ref shi and eberhart 1998 in both phases the scale of the swarm is set to 100 the number of collocation points is 20 and the maximum iteration time is 100 other initial conditions regarding the state of vehicles and constraints are presented in table 1 5 1 coordinated path planning for hitting a static underwater target in the first phase auv is static underwater and there is no coordination between uaav and auv the static target is defined as a sphere with the radius of 5m and the position of mass center is set to 0 0 30 after uaav has communicated with auv they go head for the target cooperatively the 3 d coordinated paths for uaav and auv in each phase is presented in fig 3 in fig 3 after the target is detected uaav dives into water and hits the underwater target with auv to make a better understanding of the results the states and control variables of uaav and auv in each phase are presented from fig 4 fig 5 and fig 6 it can be seen from fig 4 that it costs 18s for uaav to finish the first phase t f 1 18 s it dives into water at the end of this phase z u t f 1 2 46 m and the final distance between uaav and auv is 46 08m which meets the constraint in eq 7 besides when uaav is diving into water the velocity drops to 27 32 m s and satisfies the constraint in eqs 5 and 6 in the second phase uaav and auv are always underwater and the distance between uaav and auv the minimum value is 10 002m and appears at the ending moment is always great than d s a f e which ensures the safety of vehicles the velocities of uaav and auv are smaller than the maximum values and the values of control variables are within their ranges in both phases to check the position error and the direction of reaching the target the terminal states of uaav and auv are listed in table 2 the symbol means that there is no ideal value for this state and the item difference means the gap between uaav and auv in the corresponding state in table 2 both uaav and auv can hit the target and they hit the target from different direction i e the constraint in eq 14 is satisfied the above results demonstrate that uaav and auv can hit the underwater target simultaneously and their paths can meet all of the constraints proposed in the mathematical model to further verify the validity of pso based algorithm the convergence curves for each phase are presented as shown in fig 7 the fitness values in the two phases have different scales so they are presented separately in phase 1 the fitness value decreases from 106 to 18 and becomes convergent after about 40 times of iterations in phase 2 the fitness value can converge within about 50 times of iteration and final fitness value is 5 02 note that the convergence rate of pso algorithm in phase 2 is slower than that in phase 1 this is because the motion duration of uaav is the optimization index in phase 1 which only can be selected from some discrete values in this problem compared to the optimization index in phase 2 it is more likely for the limited number of discrete values to be stable with fewer times of iterations besides the accuracy of solution can be judged by comparing with the optimal solution and the optimal solution can be estimated by the following method according to the constraint in eq 13 the distance between uaav and auv must be greater than d s a f e d s a f e is set to 10m in this scenario as there is a rule that any two sides of a triangle is greater than the third one the distance between the vehicle and the target must be greater than 5m for uaav or auv therefore the theoretical optimal solution is greater than 5 which is very close to the final fitness value 5 02 obtained with the pso based algorithm the above results demonstrate that the pso based algorithm is effective in generating the optimal coordinated paths for uaav and auv and the solution can meet all of the constraints proposed in the path planning model 5 2 coordinated path planning considering the moving underwater target in the first scenario the static underwater target is considered while in some cases the target will move which makes the ideal terminal positions of uaav and auv change in this scenario the target moves with the velocity of v x v y v z 5 4 3 m s and other settings are the same with those in the first scenario two methods are used to obtain the coordinated paths for uaav and auv and the 3 d paths are shown in fig 8 in fig 8 with the proposed two phase method uaav and auv can cooperatively hit the target again but uaav and auv deviate from the target greatly with the whole method to further investigate the reasons for the failure of the whole method the detailed information regarding the states of uaav and auv are presented in fig 9 and fig 10 in figs 9 and 10 in both methods the vehicles can satisfy all of the constraints in the mathematical model and the terminal states of vehicles with different methods are listed in table 3 the symbol and the item difference have the same meanings with those in table 2 with the proposed two phase method uaav and auv can hit the target cooperatively while the vehicles can not finish this task under the whole method the convergence curves of fitness value are shown in fig 11 in fig 11 only the fitness value of phase 2 is presented in the two phase method this is because the optimization index of phase 1 is to dive into water and communicate with auv and the state of underwater target will not have an influence on the results in phase 1 for this reason only the convergence curve in phase 2 is drawn with the whole method the fitness value keeps to be 1000 for about 40 times of iteration and the final fitness value is 531 16 as there are too many constraints to be satisfied simultaneously in the whole method all of spare solutions in pso algorithm are not feasible before 40 times of iteration the fitness value is set to a larger value 1000 to express the infeasibility of the corresponding solution and the final fitness value is far from satisfaction compared to the whole method the proposed two phase method decomposes the complicated constraints into two parts i e constraints in the air and underwater and each part of constraints are dealt with respectively with the pso based algorithm which makes it easier to obtain satisfactory solution the final fitness value is 5 007 in the two phase method which is very close to the optimal solution again the above results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed two phase method solving the coordinated path planning problem 5 3 coordinated path planning based on predicting the position of underwater target sometimes the noise and sensor failure may affect the precision of measurement which will result in some error from the real position of target in ref karimi et al 2014 and selvaraj et al 2017 actuator saturation with time varying delay and external disturbances are considered in the design of controller and a fault tolerant sliding mode controller and a model predictive control mpc based fault tolerant controller are developed to apply in a class of takagi sugeno fuzzy systems and air breathing hypersonic vehicles respectively in the third scenario the motion of underwater target is unknown in advance and kalman filter approach is used to predict the position of target integrating the motion equations of target the target moves with the velocity of v x v y v z 3 4 5 m s but only its current position can be measured with some error with those settings the two phase method and the whole method are used again to generate paths for uaav and auv and the fitness values are shown in fig 12 with the whole method the fitness value always keeps to be 1000 during the iterative process which means none of solutions in pso based algorithm can meet all the constraints the fitness value becomes convergent after about 50 times of iteration with the two phase method and the final fitness value is 5 003 as there is no feasible solution with the whole method only the 3 d paths generated by the two phase method are given in fig 13 to further investigate how the solutions with the whole method fail to meet the constraints an analysis is conducted among the 100 solutions after 100 times of iteration the detailed information on violation of constraints is concluded in table 4 in table 4 nearly all the solutions violate the constraint that uaav must be underwater and get in touch with the static auv which is the conversion point between phase 1 and phase 2 in the two phase method this statistics results just demonstrate the rationality of dividing the whole process into two phases thus reducing the probability of infeasible solutions significantly other constraints such as the small velocity of uaav near the water surface the distance between uaav and auv and different directions to damage the target also have an influence on the solution quality to some extent to verify the effectiveness of the kalman filter in predicting the location of moving target the final predicted position of target and the terminal state of vehicles with the two phase method are listed in table 5 there is no information on the direction of target as only the position of target is concerned the position of target can be predicted with high accuracy by the kalman filter which ensures that uaav and auv can hit the target precisely in summary in all of three scenarios uaav and auv can finish the underwater target strike mission cooperatively and coordinated paths satisfying various constraints can be generated by the proposed two phase method the pso based algorithm has fast convergence rate and the obtained results are very close to the theoretical optimal solution compare to the whole method the two phase method can better address the constrains in different media and decrease the probability of infeasible solutions which provide good conditions to result in high quality solutions 6 conclusion the coordinated path planning problem for a uaav and an auv is studied in this paper literature investigation shows that the unmanned system containing heterogeneous vehicles is not given sufficient consideration compared to the coordination among uavs usvs or auvs the coordination between uaav and auv has advantages in search and communication in the underwater target strike mission the mission is divided into two phases and the complicated constraints in different media can be decomposed into each phase which reduces the difficulty of solving this problem when establishing the mathematical model of the coordinated path planning problem the kinetic model of vehicles is considered and the constraints are classified into two categories that is regarding the vehicles and regarding the strike mission besides considering different goals in each phase the optimization index aims to reduce the motion duration of uaav and minimize the terminal position error respectively to solve the established coordinated path planning model a pso based algorithm is developed to generate the optimal paths in each phase collocation points are set to reduce the computation load of search and improve the solution quality according to the form of constraints in each phase the collocation points are distributed by height and moment in the two phases also the strategy of dealing with infeasible solutions is formulated which ensures the normal operation of the whole algorithm in the simulation studies both the static and moving underwater target are considered and the superiority of the two phase method are verified by comparing with the theoretical optimal solution and the whole method the two phase method can better address the complicated constraints and result in high quality solution that is very close to the theoretical optimal solution in the future more complicated motion model of vehicle will be established and an improved kalman filter zhao et al 2019 jiang et al 2018 is also expected to better address the noise and failure of sensors besides other applications of the uuav auv system need to be discovered to expand its military and civil use 
22798,unmanned system has become more and more popular as it can adapt to diverse environments and has prospective applications especially the coordination among heterogeneous vehicles is capable of completing complicated tasks which is often beyond the ability of homogeneous vehicles in this paper the underwater target strike mission is concentrated and the mission is completed by the coordination between a uaav and an auv uaav and auv are deployed in this mission because uaav has strong search ability in air and can communicate with auv directly after it dives into water firstly to decompose the problem the mission is divided into two phases i e single flying of uaav and underwater coordination between uaav and auv in the coordinated path planning model the motion of vehicles the constraints in different media and the optimization index in each phase are all formulated into mathematical forms based on the particle swarm optimization pso algorithm the collocation points are used to determine the locations of control variables those points can reduce the computation load and improve the solution quality and they are distributed by height and moment according to the forms of constraints in each phase besides the strategy of addressing infeasible solutions is generated to guarantee the normal operation of pso based algorithm simulation results demonstrate that the proposed two phase coordinated path planning method can generate coordinated paths and the obtained results is very close to the optimal solution in theory compared to the whole method the two phase method can better deal with the complicated constraints in each phase keywords unmanned system unmanned aerial aquatic vehicle autonomous underwater vehicle coordinated path planning particle swarm optimization algorithm 1 introduction unmanned system is now becoming more common as it can complete complicated missions without human intervention unmanned system is made up by a certain number of vehicles and can be applied in detection surveillance and strike mission wang and liu 2012 the system is usually consisted of unmanned aerial vehicles uavs unmanned ground vehicles ugvs unmanned surface vehicles usvs and autonomous underwater vehicles auvs according to the types of vehicles the unmanned system can be classified into two categories i e homogeneous system and heterogeneous system in a homogeneous system the vehicles are with the same type and they execute specific tasks in a single environment for example uavs execute transportation task in air quintero et al 2016 and usvs conduct rescue task on the water surface kim et al 2017 however as there are more and more complicated tasks crossing multiple areas homogeneous system may be incapable of finishing such tasks compared to homogeneous system heterogeneous system contains different types of vehicles which enable it to cope with the cooperative tasks crossing multiple areas such as air sea surveillance air ground target track and communications relay minaeian et al 2016 murphy et al 2008 in this paper the underwater target strike mission is focused on and a uaav and an auv are equipped to complete the mission cooperatively uaav is a new type of aircraft that can navigate both in the air and underwater and the introduction of uuav extends the scope of mission and makes the task completed more efficiently yang et al 2015 in existing literature coordination in homogeneous system and heterogeneous system are both studied in homogeneous system coordination among uavs is the main concern and the task assignment and coordinated path planning problem are widely studied task assignment is a combinatorial optimization problem and uavs are usually assigned more than one task during the whole process in ref luitpold 2018 a group of uavs are required to arrive at the destinations simultaneously or sequentially with specified time delays and the goal is to minimize the total mission time to deal with the problem the algorithm for simultaneous arrival was presented firstly to calculate the shortest flight paths between all pairs of uavs and targets then an optimal assignment and a critical path are found by solving a linear bottleneck assignment problem and the other paths are prolonged to the length of the critical path by insertion in ref ma et al 2018 the coordinated motion planning problem for a team of micro aerial vehicles with high density is paid attention to the problem was solved by the proposed decentralized motion planning method in high level planning a prioritized algorithm was combined and in low level trajectory generation and vehicle control the coordination strategy was based on barrier functions other studies regarding homogeneous coordination are among ugvs or auvs the coordinated path planning problem for carrier aircraft taxiing on flight deck is essentially a ugvs coordination problem and a distributed planning architecture with multiple levels is proposed in ref wu et al 2018 under this planning architecture realistic constraints are modeled and a distributed path planning algorithm based on the asynchronous planning strategy is developed to avoid the conflict during taxi as for auvs the underwater target tracking problem is focused on considering the tracking control problem for unknown autonomous marine vehicles amvs with uncertainties and disturbances a novel data driven adaptive tracking controller is designed based on the established equivalent data model of the amv and the stability analysis for the closed loop amv system is also presented weng et al 2018 the performance of coordination algorithm also has impact on the operation of auvs system in ref xing et al 2017 the convergence analysis on multi auv system with leader follower architecture is conducted a graph theory model based on second order consensus protocol is introduced the contributions on enhancing the convergence rate are discussed especially for the influences of control gains network topology and topologies imposed on the proposed collaborative navigation algorithm coordination in heterogeneous system is often seen between uav and other types of vehicle there are strong complementarities between uav and ugv and the advantages are summarized as follows chen et al 2015 minaeian et al 2015 firstly ugv can be deployed to accurately locate ground targets to make up for the weakness of sensors located on uav limited by operating airspeed and altitude secondly uav can be regarded as communication relay as it is less blocked by obstacles than that among ugvs finally ugv have larger payload capability and longer voyage than uav in a transportation task in ref li et al 2016 a uav is used to obtain a ground image from aerial vision which is beneficial for constructing the ground map and improving the recognition accuracy of obstacles then a hybrid path planning algorithm combining global path planning with local rolling optimization is proposed to optimize the planned path the coordination between uav and usv is similar to that between uav and ugv and the uav usv system has been applied in sea rescue and marine pollution clearance murphy et al 2010 in ref ramirez et al 2011 a coordinated system for rescuing people at sea was proposed taking advantage of the high speed and sensing capability of a searching uav and the computer power and load capability of a rescuing usv in ref jung et al 2017 an algal bloom removal robotic system is proposed auv is responsible for removing the algal bloom and to improve the work efficiency a uav is utilized to detect algal blooms with an image based detection algorithm uav and auv are deployed for underwater exploration task as they work in different media they can not communicate with each other once the auv is tasked faria et al 2014 to deal with the constraints in communication three strategies i e periodic coordination shortest route coordination and probabilistic coordination are proposed in ref sujit and saripalli 2013 and the goal is to maximize the explored area while minimizing the idle time of uav and auv comparisons are conducted to analyze the characteristic of each strategy another typical heterogeneous system is composed of auv and usv which is applied in disaster assessment and sea rescue bingham et al 2008 for the underwater target strike mission discussed in this paper both homogeneous and heterogeneous system can deal with this problem but there are still some weak points when auvs are deployed to execute this task they lack of global search ability and it may cost a lot of time searching the target li et al 2017 as for the uav auv system communication from air to underwater and from underwater to air is forbidden because the gps signal is easy to be detected which makes auv unsafe barbarino et al 2011 to solve the above problems a uaav auv system is developed in this system uaav can search the underwater target in air and send the information to auv after the uaav has dived into water thus both improving the work efficiency and ensuring the safety of vehicles a new coordinated path planning model for a uaav and an auv is proposed in this paper and an effective particle swarm optimization pso based algorithm is also developed to solve the established model the main contributions of this work can be concluded as follows 1 the coordinated path planning problem for a uaav and an auv in an underwater target strike mission is described the mission is divided into two phases i e single flying of uaav and underwater coordination between uaav and auv the superiority of the two phase division is verified by comparing with treating the task as a whole process 2 the coordinated path planning model is established in this model the maneuverability of uaav in different media is taken into account and the constraints on communication safe distance and coordinated strike are all included besides the optimization indexes considering different goals of each phase are proposed 3 the pso based algorithm is developed in this algorithm chebyshev polynomials are introduced to combine with pso algorithm the locations of control variables optimized in pso algorithm are determined by chebyshev collocation points those points are distributed according to the form of constraints in each phase which matches well with the established model with this algorithm the solution which is very close to the theoretical optimal one can be obtained 2 description of the underwater target strike mission the underwater target strike mission specified in this paper is defined as follows uaav initially flies in air with high speed to search for the underwater target quickly and auv keeps static before receiving any command once uaav has discovered the underwater target it will dive into water and communicate with auv the position information of underwater target will be sent to auv then uaav and auv compute the coordinated paths head for the target and hit it simultaneously according to the above description the mission can be divided into two phases as shown in fig 1 uaav carrying the position information of underwater target dives into water to communicate with auv in this phase uaav flies without considering the position of underwater target when uaav is underwater and gets in touch with auv this phase ends 2 underwater coordination between uaav and auv after the position information of underwater target has been sent to auv uaav and auv navigate coordinately to hit the target simultaneously they hit the target from different directions because it can maximize the damage and gain the possibility of success the advantages of dividing the mission into two phases can be concluded as follows 1 in the whole mission there are various constraints in different media it is difficult to obtain feasible paths for vehicles all at once satisfying all of constraints therefore decentralization is a good way to address the constraints separately 2 as uaav navigates both in air and underwater the goals of navigating in different media may not the same a unified optimization index can not reflect the real objective of each phase and has a bad influence on the efficiency of completing the mission 3 mathematical model of coordinated path planning for a uaav and an auv the underwater target strike mission has been divided into two phases in this section the motion and maneuverability of uaav and auv in different media are depicted firstly then the constraints in each phase are set to ensure the success of communication the safety of vehicles and the success of strike mission finally optimization indexes reflecting the demand of each phase are proposed to make the goals clear 3 1 kinetic model and the maneuverability of vehicles in a path planning problem the vehicle is usually treated as a particle and a particle motion model including the particle dynamic model and the particle kinetic model is used even in some literature only the particle kinetic model is considered shen et al 2016 this is because compared to control module path planning module is an outer loop to provide the command signal which requires a fast computation speed for a rigid body the motion model is a set of nonlinear differential equations with variable coefficients it will cost much time to solve such complicated equations and it is the duty of control system to deal with the problem in a coordinated path planning problem only the kinetic model of vehicles are taken into account in existing studies to save more time for computing on coordination cui et al 2017 zhu et al 2013 besides uaav is a new type of vehicle and a completed dynamic model for a submersible uaav has not been reported so far and only wind and water tunnel testing are conducted to obtain the dynamic characteristics siddall et al 2017 in view of the above reasons the particle kinetic models of uaav and auv are used in this study in the ground frame the sea level is defined as the plane xoy and the axis oz is vertically downward to obey the right hand rule the particle kinetic model of uaav and auv under the kinetic frame is presented as follows 1 x v c o s θ c o s φ y v c o s θ s i n φ z v s i n θ θ q φ r v a where x y z and v are the position and velocity of vehicle θ and φ are the pitch angle and the yaw angle and q and r are the angular rates correspondingly a is the acceleration of vehicle note that a subscript u or a can be added to the above variables to denote the states of uaav and auv respectively in eq 1 the control variable is defined as u q r a t and the state variable is x x y z v θ φ t the motion of vehicle can be calculated according to eq 1 after the value of control variable is determined maneuverability is an important index to reflect the ability of changing velocity height and motion direction for a vehicle the constraints on the maneuverability of vehicle must be met or the obtained path is unfeasible here the constraints on q r and a are listed below 2 q u q u m a x a r u r u m a x a a u a u m a x a z u 0 3 q u q u m a x w r u r u m a x w a u a u m a x w z u 0 4 q a q a m a x r a r a m a x a a a a m a x eqs 2 and 3 are the constraints considering the maneuverability of uaav in different media and eq 4 contains the constraints of control variables for auv 3 2 constraints in each phase of strike mission in the coordinated path planning model the state of uaav and auv must obey specific constraints to ensure the safety of vehicles and the success of strike mission those constraints can be concluded as follows 1 constrains for single flying of uaav when uaav flies its velocity is limited within a certain range according to different media because of its flight performance which is determined by vehicle design and flight environment especially the velocity near the water surface must be small enough to alleviate the disturbance because a big impact may have a bad influence on the motion stability of uaav lock et al 2010 the constraints on velocity of uaav in different media and near the water surface can be presented in eqs 5 and 6 5 0 v u v u m a x a z u 0 0 v u v u m a x w z u 0 6 v u v u c r i z u z u c r i where v u m a x a and v u m a x w and the maximum velocity in air and water respectively and v u c r i and z u c r i are the maximum permitting velocity near the water surface and the critical distance from uaav to the water surface as the communication between uaav and auv is made underwater to ensure the safety uaav must be underwater and within the communication range of auv at the end of this phase this constraint can be expressed in eq 7 7 z u t f 1 0 x u t f 1 x a t f 1 2 y u t f 1 y a t f 1 2 z u t f 1 z a t f 1 2 d c o m where t f 1 is the ending moment of phase 1 and d c o m is the maximum underwater communication distance 2 constraints for underwater coordination after uaav dives into water and sends the information regarding the target position to auv they go ahead for hitting the target cooperatively in this phase as the vehicles navigate underwater the influence of underwater terrain and submerged debris must be taken into account to ensure the navigation safety the boundary of space that the submerged debris occupies is defined as f i x d y d z d 0 i 1 p where p is the number of debris f i is the function describing the boundary of debris and x d y d z d is a point on the boundary of debris besides the height of underwater mountain can be denoted as z m h x y where z m is the height corresponding to a point x y in xoy plane and h is the function describing the underwater terrain with the above descriptions on submerged debris and underwater terrain the following constraints must be met to realize the mission goal 8 t u 2 t a 2 t f 2 9 z u t 0 z a t 0 t f 1 t t f 2 10 0 v a v a m a x 11 f i x u t y u t z u t 0 f i x a t y a t z a t 0 t f 1 t t f 2 12 h x u t y u t z u t h x a t y a t z a t t f 1 t t f 2 13 x u t x a t 2 y u t y a t 2 z u t z a t 2 d s a f e t f 1 t t f 2 14 θ u t f 2 θ a t f 2 θ m i n o r φ u t f 2 φ a t f 2 φ m i n eq 8 means the navigation time of uaav and auv must be the same to hit the target simultaneously and t f 2 is the ending moment of phase 2 eqs 9 and 10 guarantee that uaav and auv are always underwater in this phase and the velocity of auv is within a certain range according to its navigation performance the constraints of submerged debris and underwater terrain are expressed in eqs 11 and 12 respectively and note that the positive direction of axis oz is downward eq 13 denotes that the distance between uaav and auv must be greater than a minimal value expressed as d s a f e to avoid collision at last uaav and auv must hit the target from different directions to make the greatest damage this constraint is formulated into eq 14 3 3 optimization indexes of coordinated path planning the constraints of coordinated path planning problem are all expressed in their mathematical forms in chapter 3 2 the number and complexity of constraints will have an influence on the solution quality i e the value of optimization index the mathematical model with fewer constraints has a higher probability to result in good solutions besides complicated constraints which are hard to be satisfied will lead to the decrease of feasible solutions as stated earlier there are two phases in the underwater target strike mission in phase 1 only uaav is in motion and the goal is to reach the water and communicate with auv within the shortest time in phase 2 uaav and auv navigate cooperatively to complete the strike mission and they must hit the target simultaneously with the minimum terminal position error the goal of each phase can be expressed in eqs 15 and 16 respectively 15 j 1 t f 1 j 2 max x u t f 2 x t a r 2 y u t f 2 y t a r 2 z u t f 2 z t a r 2 16 x a t f 2 x t a r 2 y a t f 2 y t a r 2 z a t f 2 z t a r 2 where x t a r y t a r z t a r is the position of underwater target sometimes it can not be measured accurately and an effective method is needed to predict the real position of target which can reduce the value of optimization index in eq 16 the above separate optimization indexes reflect the real goal in each phase and avoid the inappropriate description of demand by using a unified optimization index 4 coordinated path planning based on pso algorithm to obtain the paths of uaav and auv a coordinated path planning algorithm must be developed considering the characteristic of the established model firstly the distributions of control variables in each phase are determined to make the constraints being satisfied easier and improve the solution quality then pso algorithm is applied to determine the values of control variables at chebyshev points and the strategy of dealing with the solutions violating the constraints is generated finally the procedures of coordinated path planning are presented to provide a clear explanation on solving this problem 4 1 operations on the control variables according to the kinetic model of vehicle u q r a t is the control variable in each phase actually it will cost much time if the value of control variable at every sampling moment is optimized which will reduce the efficiency of algorithm to balance the computation load and efficiency collocation points are set in each phase of mission the values of control variables at sampling points can be calculated by linear interpolation considering the characteristic of each phase the distribution modes of control variable are not the same 1 distribution of collocation points in phase 1 the height between the initial height of uaav denoted as z u t 0 and the water surface is discretized as a certain number of chebyshev points and they are the locations where the control variables are optimized the locations of chebyshev points are calculated by the following formula fahroo and ross 2000 17 z m cos n m π n m 0 1 2 n where the number of collocation points is n 1 and the two endpoints i e z u t 0 and 0 are also included z m is the height of the mth collocation point the chebyshev points are dense at both ends and sparse in the middle this feature is just suitable for meeting the terminal constraints easily that there are more control variables to be operated at the end of phase as z m 1 1 in eq 17 a conversion is needed to make the value of z m fall into the interval z u t 0 0 18 h m 0 z u t 0 2 z m 0 z u t 0 2 where h m m 0 1 n are the real height of collocation points and the values of control variables at other heights denoted as h o are obtained by linear interpolation as expressed in eq 19 19 q u h o q u h m 1 q u h m h m 1 h m h o h m q u h m r u h o r u h m 1 r u h m h m 1 h m h o h m r u h m a u h o a u h m 1 a u h m h m 1 h m h o h m a u h m h m h 0 h m 1 as it is presented in the path planning model phase 1 will end when uaav is underwater and gets in touch with the static auv the ending moment also the optimization index of phase 1 j 1 t f 1 is determined by the terminal state of uaav 2 distribution of collocation points in phase 2 in this phase the navigation time for uaav and auv is t f 2 t f 2 is free and is also regarded as a control variable to be optimized as the initial positions of uaav and auv are different it is inappropriate to discretize the collocation points by height considering that the navigation time for uaav and auv is the same it is better to distribute the chebyshev points according to different moments which makes it convenient to know the states of vehicles at any moment the formula of generating the collocation points and calculating the values of control variables are the same with those from eq 17 to eq 19 by comparison the distribution modes of collocation points are different in phase 1 and phase 2 and both modes are reasonable according to the characteristic of each phase in phase 1 it is easier to judge the height of uaav by discretizing the collocation points by height this is important because many constraints in phase 1 are set by different heights such as the constraints in eqs 2 3 5 and 6 in phase 2 both uaav and auv are underwater and the constraints in this phase are set by different moments in conclusion to make the coordinated path planning algorithm more effective the distribution mode of collocation points should be in accordance with the form of constraints 4 2 generation of feasible coordinated paths integrating pso algorithm pso is a well known swarm based optimization algorithm and has been widely applied in path planning in this problem the formulas of updating solutions in pso algorithm are used and the strategy of dealing with unfeasible solutions is designed in many previous studies each particle in pso algorithm is a collection of discrete points which presents a possible path of vehicle in this problem as the kinetic model is considered each particle represents a set of control variables and the corresponding path can be obtained by solving the kinetic equations for each particle the dimensions equal to the number of collocation points denoted as d 1 and d 2 in phase 1 and 2 respectively the scale of particle swarm i e the number of initial solutions is set as n in each phase the formulas of updating solutions are presented below 20 δ u i t ω δ u i t 1 c 1 r a n d 1 u i b t u i t c 2 r a n d 2 u g b t u i t 21 u i t 1 u i t δ u i t where u i t is the control vector of the ith particle in the tth iteration and u i b t and u g b t are the control vectors corresponding to the individual best solution and the global best solution ω is the inertia weight c 1 and c 2 are acceleration constraints and rand1 and rand2 are random number obeyed uniform distribution in interval 0 1 one times of iteration is finished after the solutions are updated according to the formulas in eqs 20 and 21 note that if any control variable in u i t 1 goes out of range it will be set to the closest threshold to ensure the normal operation of algorithm for each u i t 1 it is put into the kinetic model of vehicle to obtain the states of uaav and auv and the duration of phase 1 and the terminal state of phase 2 can be used to calculate the fitness value according to eq 15 or eq 16 respectively if the state of vehicle violates any constraint the fitness value of u i t 1 will be set to a large value to denote that the solution is infeasible and must be abandoned 4 3 procedures of solving the coordinated path planning problem the procedures of pso based algorithm solving the coordinated path planning problem for uaav and auv are shown in fig 2 in fig 2 t1 and t2 are the current iteration number in phase 1 and 2 respectively and iter is the maximum iteration times the steps in phase 1 and 2 are roughly the same compared to phase 1 there are more control variables in phase 2 the control variables are q u r u and a u in phase 1 and are q u r u a u q u r u a u and t f 2 in phase 2 and the constraints in this phase are more complicated the final optimal coordinated paths will be outputted when the maximum iterations is reached and the corresponding states of uaav and auv can be obtained by solving the kinetic model note that when using the pso algorithm in phase 1 and phase 2 there are two random numbers in eq 20 which will cause some uncertainties for example a greater value of rand1 makes the new solution refer more to the individual best solution while the global best solution is paid more attention when rand2 is larger 5 simulation studies to investigate the rationality of the established model for the underwater strike mission of uaav and auv and the validity of the proposed pso based coordinated path planning algorithm simulations under different situations are conducted in the first scenario a static underwater target is considered and the strike mission begins after the target is detected by uaav the paths of vehicles in each phase are generated by the proposed two phase method and the optimality of solution is analyzed based on the setting in the first scenario a moving underwater target with known path is taken into account in the second scenario two methods i e the two phase method and the whole method in this method the task is treated as a single process which is often used in uavs coordination problems are both applied to solve the problem and comparison is made a moving target with unknown path is considered in the third scenario and kalman filtering is used to predict its position in this scenario two methods are also used to obtain the results and comparison is conducted again note that in these simulations the time interval between two adjacent sampling moments is set to δ t 1s and the initial positions of uaav and auv are set as 2000 500 200 and 1000 100 20 respectively all the results are obtained by running the programs on a desktop with intel core i7 3370 3 40 ghz the parameters in pso algorithm are referred to ref shi and eberhart 1998 in both phases the scale of the swarm is set to 100 the number of collocation points is 20 and the maximum iteration time is 100 other initial conditions regarding the state of vehicles and constraints are presented in table 1 5 1 coordinated path planning for hitting a static underwater target in the first phase auv is static underwater and there is no coordination between uaav and auv the static target is defined as a sphere with the radius of 5m and the position of mass center is set to 0 0 30 after uaav has communicated with auv they go head for the target cooperatively the 3 d coordinated paths for uaav and auv in each phase is presented in fig 3 in fig 3 after the target is detected uaav dives into water and hits the underwater target with auv to make a better understanding of the results the states and control variables of uaav and auv in each phase are presented from fig 4 fig 5 and fig 6 it can be seen from fig 4 that it costs 18s for uaav to finish the first phase t f 1 18 s it dives into water at the end of this phase z u t f 1 2 46 m and the final distance between uaav and auv is 46 08m which meets the constraint in eq 7 besides when uaav is diving into water the velocity drops to 27 32 m s and satisfies the constraint in eqs 5 and 6 in the second phase uaav and auv are always underwater and the distance between uaav and auv the minimum value is 10 002m and appears at the ending moment is always great than d s a f e which ensures the safety of vehicles the velocities of uaav and auv are smaller than the maximum values and the values of control variables are within their ranges in both phases to check the position error and the direction of reaching the target the terminal states of uaav and auv are listed in table 2 the symbol means that there is no ideal value for this state and the item difference means the gap between uaav and auv in the corresponding state in table 2 both uaav and auv can hit the target and they hit the target from different direction i e the constraint in eq 14 is satisfied the above results demonstrate that uaav and auv can hit the underwater target simultaneously and their paths can meet all of the constraints proposed in the mathematical model to further verify the validity of pso based algorithm the convergence curves for each phase are presented as shown in fig 7 the fitness values in the two phases have different scales so they are presented separately in phase 1 the fitness value decreases from 106 to 18 and becomes convergent after about 40 times of iterations in phase 2 the fitness value can converge within about 50 times of iteration and final fitness value is 5 02 note that the convergence rate of pso algorithm in phase 2 is slower than that in phase 1 this is because the motion duration of uaav is the optimization index in phase 1 which only can be selected from some discrete values in this problem compared to the optimization index in phase 2 it is more likely for the limited number of discrete values to be stable with fewer times of iterations besides the accuracy of solution can be judged by comparing with the optimal solution and the optimal solution can be estimated by the following method according to the constraint in eq 13 the distance between uaav and auv must be greater than d s a f e d s a f e is set to 10m in this scenario as there is a rule that any two sides of a triangle is greater than the third one the distance between the vehicle and the target must be greater than 5m for uaav or auv therefore the theoretical optimal solution is greater than 5 which is very close to the final fitness value 5 02 obtained with the pso based algorithm the above results demonstrate that the pso based algorithm is effective in generating the optimal coordinated paths for uaav and auv and the solution can meet all of the constraints proposed in the path planning model 5 2 coordinated path planning considering the moving underwater target in the first scenario the static underwater target is considered while in some cases the target will move which makes the ideal terminal positions of uaav and auv change in this scenario the target moves with the velocity of v x v y v z 5 4 3 m s and other settings are the same with those in the first scenario two methods are used to obtain the coordinated paths for uaav and auv and the 3 d paths are shown in fig 8 in fig 8 with the proposed two phase method uaav and auv can cooperatively hit the target again but uaav and auv deviate from the target greatly with the whole method to further investigate the reasons for the failure of the whole method the detailed information regarding the states of uaav and auv are presented in fig 9 and fig 10 in figs 9 and 10 in both methods the vehicles can satisfy all of the constraints in the mathematical model and the terminal states of vehicles with different methods are listed in table 3 the symbol and the item difference have the same meanings with those in table 2 with the proposed two phase method uaav and auv can hit the target cooperatively while the vehicles can not finish this task under the whole method the convergence curves of fitness value are shown in fig 11 in fig 11 only the fitness value of phase 2 is presented in the two phase method this is because the optimization index of phase 1 is to dive into water and communicate with auv and the state of underwater target will not have an influence on the results in phase 1 for this reason only the convergence curve in phase 2 is drawn with the whole method the fitness value keeps to be 1000 for about 40 times of iteration and the final fitness value is 531 16 as there are too many constraints to be satisfied simultaneously in the whole method all of spare solutions in pso algorithm are not feasible before 40 times of iteration the fitness value is set to a larger value 1000 to express the infeasibility of the corresponding solution and the final fitness value is far from satisfaction compared to the whole method the proposed two phase method decomposes the complicated constraints into two parts i e constraints in the air and underwater and each part of constraints are dealt with respectively with the pso based algorithm which makes it easier to obtain satisfactory solution the final fitness value is 5 007 in the two phase method which is very close to the optimal solution again the above results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed two phase method solving the coordinated path planning problem 5 3 coordinated path planning based on predicting the position of underwater target sometimes the noise and sensor failure may affect the precision of measurement which will result in some error from the real position of target in ref karimi et al 2014 and selvaraj et al 2017 actuator saturation with time varying delay and external disturbances are considered in the design of controller and a fault tolerant sliding mode controller and a model predictive control mpc based fault tolerant controller are developed to apply in a class of takagi sugeno fuzzy systems and air breathing hypersonic vehicles respectively in the third scenario the motion of underwater target is unknown in advance and kalman filter approach is used to predict the position of target integrating the motion equations of target the target moves with the velocity of v x v y v z 3 4 5 m s but only its current position can be measured with some error with those settings the two phase method and the whole method are used again to generate paths for uaav and auv and the fitness values are shown in fig 12 with the whole method the fitness value always keeps to be 1000 during the iterative process which means none of solutions in pso based algorithm can meet all the constraints the fitness value becomes convergent after about 50 times of iteration with the two phase method and the final fitness value is 5 003 as there is no feasible solution with the whole method only the 3 d paths generated by the two phase method are given in fig 13 to further investigate how the solutions with the whole method fail to meet the constraints an analysis is conducted among the 100 solutions after 100 times of iteration the detailed information on violation of constraints is concluded in table 4 in table 4 nearly all the solutions violate the constraint that uaav must be underwater and get in touch with the static auv which is the conversion point between phase 1 and phase 2 in the two phase method this statistics results just demonstrate the rationality of dividing the whole process into two phases thus reducing the probability of infeasible solutions significantly other constraints such as the small velocity of uaav near the water surface the distance between uaav and auv and different directions to damage the target also have an influence on the solution quality to some extent to verify the effectiveness of the kalman filter in predicting the location of moving target the final predicted position of target and the terminal state of vehicles with the two phase method are listed in table 5 there is no information on the direction of target as only the position of target is concerned the position of target can be predicted with high accuracy by the kalman filter which ensures that uaav and auv can hit the target precisely in summary in all of three scenarios uaav and auv can finish the underwater target strike mission cooperatively and coordinated paths satisfying various constraints can be generated by the proposed two phase method the pso based algorithm has fast convergence rate and the obtained results are very close to the theoretical optimal solution compare to the whole method the two phase method can better address the constrains in different media and decrease the probability of infeasible solutions which provide good conditions to result in high quality solutions 6 conclusion the coordinated path planning problem for a uaav and an auv is studied in this paper literature investigation shows that the unmanned system containing heterogeneous vehicles is not given sufficient consideration compared to the coordination among uavs usvs or auvs the coordination between uaav and auv has advantages in search and communication in the underwater target strike mission the mission is divided into two phases and the complicated constraints in different media can be decomposed into each phase which reduces the difficulty of solving this problem when establishing the mathematical model of the coordinated path planning problem the kinetic model of vehicles is considered and the constraints are classified into two categories that is regarding the vehicles and regarding the strike mission besides considering different goals in each phase the optimization index aims to reduce the motion duration of uaav and minimize the terminal position error respectively to solve the established coordinated path planning model a pso based algorithm is developed to generate the optimal paths in each phase collocation points are set to reduce the computation load of search and improve the solution quality according to the form of constraints in each phase the collocation points are distributed by height and moment in the two phases also the strategy of dealing with infeasible solutions is formulated which ensures the normal operation of the whole algorithm in the simulation studies both the static and moving underwater target are considered and the superiority of the two phase method are verified by comparing with the theoretical optimal solution and the whole method the two phase method can better address the complicated constraints and result in high quality solution that is very close to the theoretical optimal solution in the future more complicated motion model of vehicle will be established and an improved kalman filter zhao et al 2019 jiang et al 2018 is also expected to better address the noise and failure of sensors besides other applications of the uuav auv system need to be discovered to expand its military and civil use 
22799,ice loads should be considered in the design stage of the ice going ships the loads will be determined by the ice features present given the location the time of year and the environmental conditions normally a ship follows a sea path covered with ice broken by an ice breaker therefore it is important to estimate its performance in broken ice fields in this study a numerical simulation of an ice going ship navigating through broken ice field was carried out using the finite element method ice floes with random distributions of size thickness and shape were modeled and an efficient numerical simulation method for ice sea ice structure and ice ice interactions was proposed for rapid computation important parameters such as the drag force coefficient and the pressure penetration relationship in interaction modeling were obtained based on the results of detailed analysis using the coupled eulerian lagrangian method the simulations were conducted under the same conditions as tests carried out in an ice model basin and the results were compared keywords ice load ice going ship broken ice fields finite element method coupled eulerian lagrangian method model test 1 introduction as global warming is accelerating the interest in the safety and efficiency of vessels operating on ice covered seas is increasing because ice is characterized by the location time of year and environmental conditions various types of ice should be considered carefully from the design stage of a ship continuous ice cover or broken ice pieces are important in terms of ship operation vessels passing through continuous ice cover experience high resistance because they need to break down and push out the ice sheets on the other hand the main force that the ships receive as they pass through broken ice fields is the force pushing out the ice floes this resistance is generally smaller than the ice sheet breaking resistance but it requires special attention because the ships encounter broken ice floes more frequently than ice sheets broken ice can be produced by icebreakers and ship traffic the size of the ice fragments depends on many factors such as the ice type and thickness and forces that break up the ice the shape of the ice fragments is random the shapes are sometimes triangular or rectangular but are often have more sides have round sides or have four sides but are not rectangular the thickness of ice depends on the original ice sheet thickness so it is expected that the range of thicknesses of broken ice in a particular area would not be large aboulazm 1989 when a ship navigates a broken ice covered area the ice is bent downwards at the same time as it is pushed in front of the ship the behavior of the ice depends on the concentration i e ice floes are pushed down following the buttock lines at high concentrations whereas the floes might be pushed just sideways but not down under lower concentrations riska 2010 riska 2010 classified the most commonly accepted average forces into four categories as the forces to break the ice forces to submerge the broken ice friction forces along the ship hull and hydrodynamic forces among these the last three forces should be taken into consideration when determining the ice load in a broken ice field a range of numerical models have been developed to estimate the ice load of ships navigating in broken ice fields metrikin et al 2015 divided recent numerical simulation methods into three categories the finite element method fem particle in cell pic and discrete element method dem kim et al 2013 wang and derradji aouat 2011 and millan and wang 2011 applied fem using the commercial fe package ls dyna to estimate the ice load acting on structures they applied the arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale method to simulate the water ice structure interaction problem sayed 1997 introduced the particle in cell method for an ice load estimation and further developed the model at the national research council of canada the pic model is semi lagrangian it employs discrete particles to model ice movement while solving the momentum equations over an eulerian grid the use of particles improves the accuracy of modeling the ice boundary conditions at the same time the use of an eulerian grid makes it possible to apply an implicit numerical solution scheme for momentum equations which increases the computational efficiency substantially cundall and strack 1978 developed the discrete element method and it has been proven to be a powerful numerical technique that can calculate the motions of multiple bodies and their interactions sun and shen 2012 used dem to simulate pancake ice floes pancake ice floes were modeled as 3 d dilated particles and the relationship between the ice load and wave was calculated in addition alawneh 2014 proposed gpu based event mechanics this method enables hyper real time simulations of ice interactions using the high performance of the gpu based on popov assumptions popov et al 1967 in this study the finite element method fem was adopted to determine the loads by ice impacts on a ship hull in broken ice fields to improve the accuracy and minimize the analysis time an efficient numerical model for ice sea ice structure and ice ice interactions was proposed the interactions were modeled using parameters such as the drag coefficient and pressure penetration curve and they were obtained based on the result of detailed analysis using the coupled eulerian lagrangian method finally comparisons were made between the ice loads obtained using the proposed method and the model tests carried out at the ice model basin in the korea research institute of ships and ocean engineering kriso to validate the performance of the proposed method 2 analysis methodology the proposed analysis methodology is based on a commercially available finite element program abaqus the use of commercial software in an ice load simulation has some benefits as follows easy generation of user defined external loads very robust contact algorithm for multi body interactions flexible contact interaction models and easy modeling of multi bodies via script language starting from these potential benefits a three dimensional finite element analysis methodology was developed using abaqus explicit software abaqus explicit is a 3d finite element analysis program for simulating nonlinear transient dynamic problems based on explicit time integration first an automatic modeling scheme was developed to generate ice floes with random distributions of size thickness and shape a user subroutine for a simplified ice fluid interaction model including the drag force and hydrostatic pressure was implemented normal contact interaction behavior of ice structure or ice ice was modeled properly and the interaction parameters were determined through detailed analyses 2 1 modeling of broken ice floes the ice was modeled using solid elements that behave like a rigid body fig 1 outlines the process of generating ice elements first the thickness distribution of the ice floes was determined according to the ice field conditions to efficiently generate a polygon for an ice floe in this study a method of creating points on the circle s perimeter and connecting the points was used the radii of the circles were then determined randomly within the criterion for determining an unbreakable ice determination of the range of broken ice sizes is important because ice with a size above a certain level can be broken again due to bending or splitting failure because it was assumed that no additional breaking of ice floes occurs in a numerical simulation each ice floe should be made up within the criterion in this study a simple criterion for determining an unbreakable ice floe developed by lindseth 2013 was employed according to the criterion given the ice thickness distribution of a specific area it is possible to estimate the diameter distribution of the ice that is not considered to be divided into small pieces of ice for example if the largest ice thickness in a given area is 1 m the largest broken ice diameter in the area would be approximately 10 9 m once this upper limit ice size was determined 2d circles were generated on a space under the predefined concentration larger circles are placed first and smaller ones come later followed by even smaller ones if the generated circle of a given size overlapped with existing ones another position was searched until there was no overlap the placement continued until the concentration reached the specified level within the specified area to make polygon shaped ice points were generated randomly along the perimeter of the generated circles when the point generation for polygon formation is completed areas of each polygon are calculated based on the coordinates of the points and concentration is determined by the sum of the areas of the polygons when polygons are generated based on random vertices within circles the floe areas and concentrations are not preserved so this should be considered in the process of creating the 2d circles the areas are newly calculated for the generated polygons and if the calculated concentration does not match the target value circles are regenerated in this particular simulation case it was assumed that the ice floes were in the shape of a quadrangle hence four points were generated on the perimeter and the points were connected to produce a polygon a 3d solid was then generated by extruding the quadrangle with the depth corresponding to the ice thickness finally the finite element mesh was generated on the extruded solid but special consideration was given to the nodal location as the drag force and moment were applied to the centroid of the ice a mesh was generated in such a way that the nodes were located at the centroid of the ice 2 2 modeling of the ice sea water interaction ice is subjected to several hydrodynamic loads such as drag inertia and buoyancy forces because they are partly or mostly submerged in sea water to consider the interaction between ice and sea water kim et al 2013 and wang and derradji aouat 2011 employed a coupled arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale method which allows for a lagrangian ice floes interacting with eulerian fluids this method can yield relatively realistic results but it requires huge analysis time therefore a simplified interaction model was developed and implemented as a user subroutine loading to simulate the motion of floating ice in seawater 6 degrees of freedom motions were considered in this study as shown in fig 2 the drag force f d and drag moment m d on an ice floe as expressed in eqs 1 and 2 respectively were applied to the planar motions such as surge sway and yaw hopkins and shen 2001 1 f d 1 2 c d f ρ w a s u b v v w v v w 2 m d 1 2 c d f r 2 ρ w a s u b ω ω where c d f is the drag force coefficient ρ w is the water density and a s u b is submerged area v is the velocity of the ice floe and v w is the water velocity r is the mean distance between the centroid and each vertex of floe and ω is the angular velocity of the ice floe the buoyancy pressure shown in eq 3 acts on the floe surface so that the heave roll and pitch have a hydrodynamic restoring force and moments for the application of buoyancy in a heeled situation due to roll or pitch the pressure is applied against the local x y coordinate system of the corresponding surface pressure is also applied to the sides of the floe to account for the large angular movement as shown in fig 3 3 p x y z ρ w g h x y z where x y and z are the local coordinates for the surface g is the gravitational acceleration and h is the vertical displacement of a given position with respect to its initial position the added mass was included in the form of a constant value and was taken into consideration by multiplying the mass by 1 c m in the motion equations the added mass coefficient in the simulation was 0 41 with reference to newman 1977 2 3 modeling of ice structure interaction since individual ice floe was handled as rigid body in this study the penetration between colliding objects was allowed in order to consider the deformation of the floe the penetration characteristics was defined as pressure penetration relation this contact model was converted from the contact model using the linear spring which is mainly used in the discrete element method hopkins and shen 2001 sun and shen 2012 liu and ji 2018 the difference is that instead of force pressure is introduced to minimize the effect of the shape of the contact surface for efficiency of computation similar to the linear spring a linear pressure penetration curve was assumed passing through the origin the slope of the calculated curve is 35 367 pa m which was obtained by linear regression analysis on the results of a series of detailed analyses based on the mechanical properties of ice used in the numerical simulation of kim et al 2015 however since the assumptions are just simple approximations which do not reflect complicated ice failure mechanisms further studies are required for the application of reasonable pressure penetration relation for example an average pressure area relationship which can be found in iso 19906 can be converted to an average pressure penetration relationship iso 2010 an alternative would be to use a fixed nominal global crushing pressure such as 1 5 mpa for real ice masterson and frederking 1993 3 calibration of the drag force coefficient prior to the simulation for the model test the drag force coefficient which is one of the key parameters used in sea ice interaction modeling was determined via a calibration process where a comparison was made with the results of the detailed fluid structure interaction analysis the drag force coefficient was adjusted so that the behaviors of the ice floes in fluid structure analysis and the simplified analysis match each other well for detailed fluid structure interaction analysis the same cel method used in ice structure interaction analysis was employed as shown in fig 4 a sea water was modeled as a eulerian mesh and both the ice and ship were modeled as a rigid lagrangian mesh the test was carried out with a small number of ice floes on a small tank for numerical efficiency the tank was 1 7 m in length and width and 0 5 m deep the ice concentration was 40 and the speed of the ship was 0 357 m s the floes were 0 057 m thick and shaped randomly into convex polygons with four sides the mesh size for sea water was determined to be 1 3 of the ice thickness for a detailed description to prevent movement of ice floes because of the pressure gradient of fluid in front of the moving vessel the interaction between sea water and the ship was not taken into account simplified analysis using the proposed method was performed under the same conditions and the results were compared to derive the proper drag force coefficient four ice floes near the ship whose motion responses are expected to be significant were selected for the comparison as shown in fig 5 because the shape of the projected frontal area of each ice floe is different and it changes continuously as the floes changes its direction a single representative value that can cover all situations is required therefore the drag force coefficient producing results closest to the detailed analysis was selected after performing some parametric studies by trial and error the determined drag force coefficient was 5 25 and produced reasonably good results the positions and velocities for each ice floe and the vessel over time were compared fig 6 displays the position change of ice floes in 2d space together with the vessel path and figs 7 and 8 show the velocity in the x and y directions respectively the positions of the ice floes matched each other fairly well particularly during the early stages of drift after collision the same trend can be observed for the velocity plots of figs 7 and 8 showing that the correspondence between the two cases is relatively good during the early stages of drift after collision for the simulation for 6 s the detailed analysis took 7 h and 58 min whereas the analysis using the proposed model took only 2 min and 20 s therefore the proposed model has a great advantage in terms of saving analysis time 4 model tests model tests were conducted in an ice tank at the korea research institute of ships and ocean engineering kriso the kriso ice model basin uses eg ad cd model ice where eg ad and cd denote the ethylene glycol aliphatic detergent and controlled density respectively and the crystal structure of model ice is a columnar type the preparation of the model ice sheet begins with a wet seeding procedure after cooling the model ice is grown at 18 0 5 c and the growth rate is approximately 2 1 mm h during freezing in particular micro bubbles will be discharged uniformly from the bottom of the ice model basin to control the density of model ice after the freezing phase the air temperature will be increased to 2 c to control the strength of the model ice fig 9 shows the preparation procedures for the kriso ice model basin jeong et al 2017 and cho et al 2013 presented the detailed model test procedure model tests were formed in the kriso ice model basin using a 1 18 667 scale mode ship of the korean icebreaking research vessel ibrv araon fig 10 shows the bow and stern parts of the model ship respectively the design requirements for the araon was for a 1 0 m thickness of level ice with a flexural strength of not less than 630 kpa at a speed of 3 knots table 1 lists the main particulars and model ice properties the model tests were carried out by towing a model ship with three different constant speeds 0 119 0 357 and 0 595 m s in model scale 1 3 and 5 kts in full scale through the pack ice channels these channels were covered by an irregular shape of ice floes and two different ice concentrations 60 and 80 were considered as shown in fig 11 fig 12 shows the ice model test process under 80 pack ice conditions with a speed of 0 357 m s in this study the model test results were compared with the corresponding results obtained from a numerical simulation to validate the accuracy of the proposed method table 2 lists the test conditions for comparing the results 5 numerical simulation numerical simulations were carried out using the proposed model under the same conditions as the model test fig 13 shows the analysis model which is composed of the vessel channel wall and ice floes to model the ice floes as close as possible with those used in the model test the maximum and minimum size of the ice floes used in the model test were selected from the test photographs and ice floes were then generated to have a random distribution between these two sizes each ice floe was modeled as a randomly shaped quadrangle fig 14 shows the probability distribution of the mass of the randomly generated ice floes for the 60 and 80 concentration cases the probability distributions of both cases were similar to each other fig 15 shows the distribution of the apex angles of the floes which is defined as illustrated in the figure the angles were distributed from 30 to 170 centered at 90 for both cases rigid walls were modeled considering the width and length of the channel used in the experiment therefore when the ship passed the 2 3 point of the channel the motion of the ice floes was affected by the wall of the channel so the measured data after the point were not used in the result comparison fig 16 shows snapshots of the simulation at t 0 s and t 30 s under a 60 and 80 concentration for a 0 357 m s velocity condition respectively fig 17 presents magnified snapshots of the interaction between the ice floes and the ship hull for the case of an 80 concentration figs 18 and 19 show the distribution of the number of impacts according to the position on the ship with respect to the longitudinal and transverse directions respectively the longitudinal distribution shows that more than half of the total impacts were concentrated on the bow part of the ship whereas the transverse distribution shows impacts concentrated at the center and both sides of the bow it can be observed that there are more impacts to the right of the bow despite being straight ahead it is thought that this is because the analysis time is short if the analysis time is long enough it is expected to show a nearly symmetrical distribution fig 20 shows the set of locations of the impacts in plan view the small dots are the nodal points of the ship mesh and the red circle represents the location where ice impacts are highly populated the red circles are the points that experienced the upper 50 of ice impacts fig 21 shows the locations of the impacts in elevation view in the height direction more than half of the total impacts were concentrated near the draft line of the bow as expected figs 22 and 23 show the time histories of the simulations under 60 and 80 concentration respectively to exclude the initial transient section of the analysis the data from 8 to 30 s in the case of 60 concentration and from 17 to 50 s in the case of 80 concentration were used to calculate the average these two time instances for data selection were chosen because they are the time instances when the first major load drops took place figs 24 and 25 compare the results of the model test with the simulation in terms of the average ice load under the concentration of 60 and 80 respectively the results show that ice impact forces increase with increasing ice concentration and ship velocity as expected in the case of the 60 ice concentration both results compare quite well whereas some deviations were observed for 0 119 and 0 595 m sec ship velocity under the 80 concentration 6 conclusions this paper proposed a novel numerical simulation method using fem for ice impacts on a ship hull in broken ice fields based on the study results using the proposed method the following conclusions were derived an automatic modeling scheme was developed to model ice floes of a random size thickness shape and distribution consequently the efforts required to model a large number of discrete ice floes were minimized to minimize the computational burden of time domain simulation the ice sea ice structure and ice ice interactions were handled in a simplified manner important parameters such as pressure penetration relation and drag force coefficient in the interaction modeling were obtained based on the results of pre performed analysis using the coupled eulerian lagrangian method to increase the accuracy the penetration between colliding objects was allowed in order to consider the deformation of the floe based on the assumed pressure penetration relationship which was obtained by linear regression analysis on the results of a series of detailed analyzes however since the assumptions are just simple approximations which do not reflect complicated ice failure mechanisms further studies are required for the application of reasonable pressure penetration relationship the drag force coefficient was determined by calibrating them though a comparison with the results of detailed analysis using the coupled eulerian lagrangian method based on detailed analysis the drag coefficient was determined in such a way that the time variation of both the displacement and velocity of ice floe near the ship matches well with those of the simplified analysis simulations using the proposed model were carried out under the same conditions as the model test the distributions of the impact locations on the ship with respect to the longitudinal and transverse direction were investigated which were found to be in line with the physical intuition the impacts were more populated on the bow area of the ship as well as near the draft line of the ship the simulation results showed that ice impact forces increase with increasing ice concentration and ship velocity both the numerical and experimental results were in good agreement from an average ice load point of view except for low speeds under the 80 concentration considering the dramatic reduction of computational burden the proposed modeling scheme and analysis methodology is expected to be useful in ice load predictions despite the advantages of the methodology proposed in this study the accuracy of the result can be restricted by assumptions and simplifications if the main parameters such as drag force coefficient or pressure penetration relation are determined more realistically it is expected that the simulation data would give better fits to the model test results therefore further studies about the parameters are required and comparative studies with full scale data are recommended acknowledgement this study was supported by the industrial convergence strategic technology development program 10063417 development of basic

22799,ice loads should be considered in the design stage of the ice going ships the loads will be determined by the ice features present given the location the time of year and the environmental conditions normally a ship follows a sea path covered with ice broken by an ice breaker therefore it is important to estimate its performance in broken ice fields in this study a numerical simulation of an ice going ship navigating through broken ice field was carried out using the finite element method ice floes with random distributions of size thickness and shape were modeled and an efficient numerical simulation method for ice sea ice structure and ice ice interactions was proposed for rapid computation important parameters such as the drag force coefficient and the pressure penetration relationship in interaction modeling were obtained based on the results of detailed analysis using the coupled eulerian lagrangian method the simulations were conducted under the same conditions as tests carried out in an ice model basin and the results were compared keywords ice load ice going ship broken ice fields finite element method coupled eulerian lagrangian method model test 1 introduction as global warming is accelerating the interest in the safety and efficiency of vessels operating on ice covered seas is increasing because ice is characterized by the location time of year and environmental conditions various types of ice should be considered carefully from the design stage of a ship continuous ice cover or broken ice pieces are important in terms of ship operation vessels passing through continuous ice cover experience high resistance because they need to break down and push out the ice sheets on the other hand the main force that the ships receive as they pass through broken ice fields is the force pushing out the ice floes this resistance is generally smaller than the ice sheet breaking resistance but it requires special attention because the ships encounter broken ice floes more frequently than ice sheets broken ice can be produced by icebreakers and ship traffic the size of the ice fragments depends on many factors such as the ice type and thickness and forces that break up the ice the shape of the ice fragments is random the shapes are sometimes triangular or rectangular but are often have more sides have round sides or have four sides but are not rectangular the thickness of ice depends on the original ice sheet thickness so it is expected that the range of thicknesses of broken ice in a particular area would not be large aboulazm 1989 when a ship navigates a broken ice covered area the ice is bent downwards at the same time as it is pushed in front of the ship the behavior of the ice depends on the concentration i e ice floes are pushed down following the buttock lines at high concentrations whereas the floes might be pushed just sideways but not down under lower concentrations riska 2010 riska 2010 classified the most commonly accepted average forces into four categories as the forces to break the ice forces to submerge the broken ice friction forces along the ship hull and hydrodynamic forces among these the last three forces should be taken into consideration when determining the ice load in a broken ice field a range of numerical models have been developed to estimate the ice load of ships navigating in broken ice fields metrikin et al 2015 divided recent numerical simulation methods into three categories the finite element method fem particle in cell pic and discrete element method dem kim et al 2013 wang and derradji aouat 2011 and millan and wang 2011 applied fem using the commercial fe package ls dyna to estimate the ice load acting on structures they applied the arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale method to simulate the water ice structure interaction problem sayed 1997 introduced the particle in cell method for an ice load estimation and further developed the model at the national research council of canada the pic model is semi lagrangian it employs discrete particles to model ice movement while solving the momentum equations over an eulerian grid the use of particles improves the accuracy of modeling the ice boundary conditions at the same time the use of an eulerian grid makes it possible to apply an implicit numerical solution scheme for momentum equations which increases the computational efficiency substantially cundall and strack 1978 developed the discrete element method and it has been proven to be a powerful numerical technique that can calculate the motions of multiple bodies and their interactions sun and shen 2012 used dem to simulate pancake ice floes pancake ice floes were modeled as 3 d dilated particles and the relationship between the ice load and wave was calculated in addition alawneh 2014 proposed gpu based event mechanics this method enables hyper real time simulations of ice interactions using the high performance of the gpu based on popov assumptions popov et al 1967 in this study the finite element method fem was adopted to determine the loads by ice impacts on a ship hull in broken ice fields to improve the accuracy and minimize the analysis time an efficient numerical model for ice sea ice structure and ice ice interactions was proposed the interactions were modeled using parameters such as the drag coefficient and pressure penetration curve and they were obtained based on the result of detailed analysis using the coupled eulerian lagrangian method finally comparisons were made between the ice loads obtained using the proposed method and the model tests carried out at the ice model basin in the korea research institute of ships and ocean engineering kriso to validate the performance of the proposed method 2 analysis methodology the proposed analysis methodology is based on a commercially available finite element program abaqus the use of commercial software in an ice load simulation has some benefits as follows easy generation of user defined external loads very robust contact algorithm for multi body interactions flexible contact interaction models and easy modeling of multi bodies via script language starting from these potential benefits a three dimensional finite element analysis methodology was developed using abaqus explicit software abaqus explicit is a 3d finite element analysis program for simulating nonlinear transient dynamic problems based on explicit time integration first an automatic modeling scheme was developed to generate ice floes with random distributions of size thickness and shape a user subroutine for a simplified ice fluid interaction model including the drag force and hydrostatic pressure was implemented normal contact interaction behavior of ice structure or ice ice was modeled properly and the interaction parameters were determined through detailed analyses 2 1 modeling of broken ice floes the ice was modeled using solid elements that behave like a rigid body fig 1 outlines the process of generating ice elements first the thickness distribution of the ice floes was determined according to the ice field conditions to efficiently generate a polygon for an ice floe in this study a method of creating points on the circle s perimeter and connecting the points was used the radii of the circles were then determined randomly within the criterion for determining an unbreakable ice determination of the range of broken ice sizes is important because ice with a size above a certain level can be broken again due to bending or splitting failure because it was assumed that no additional breaking of ice floes occurs in a numerical simulation each ice floe should be made up within the criterion in this study a simple criterion for determining an unbreakable ice floe developed by lindseth 2013 was employed according to the criterion given the ice thickness distribution of a specific area it is possible to estimate the diameter distribution of the ice that is not considered to be divided into small pieces of ice for example if the largest ice thickness in a given area is 1 m the largest broken ice diameter in the area would be approximately 10 9 m once this upper limit ice size was determined 2d circles were generated on a space under the predefined concentration larger circles are placed first and smaller ones come later followed by even smaller ones if the generated circle of a given size overlapped with existing ones another position was searched until there was no overlap the placement continued until the concentration reached the specified level within the specified area to make polygon shaped ice points were generated randomly along the perimeter of the generated circles when the point generation for polygon formation is completed areas of each polygon are calculated based on the coordinates of the points and concentration is determined by the sum of the areas of the polygons when polygons are generated based on random vertices within circles the floe areas and concentrations are not preserved so this should be considered in the process of creating the 2d circles the areas are newly calculated for the generated polygons and if the calculated concentration does not match the target value circles are regenerated in this particular simulation case it was assumed that the ice floes were in the shape of a quadrangle hence four points were generated on the perimeter and the points were connected to produce a polygon a 3d solid was then generated by extruding the quadrangle with the depth corresponding to the ice thickness finally the finite element mesh was generated on the extruded solid but special consideration was given to the nodal location as the drag force and moment were applied to the centroid of the ice a mesh was generated in such a way that the nodes were located at the centroid of the ice 2 2 modeling of the ice sea water interaction ice is subjected to several hydrodynamic loads such as drag inertia and buoyancy forces because they are partly or mostly submerged in sea water to consider the interaction between ice and sea water kim et al 2013 and wang and derradji aouat 2011 employed a coupled arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale method which allows for a lagrangian ice floes interacting with eulerian fluids this method can yield relatively realistic results but it requires huge analysis time therefore a simplified interaction model was developed and implemented as a user subroutine loading to simulate the motion of floating ice in seawater 6 degrees of freedom motions were considered in this study as shown in fig 2 the drag force f d and drag moment m d on an ice floe as expressed in eqs 1 and 2 respectively were applied to the planar motions such as surge sway and yaw hopkins and shen 2001 1 f d 1 2 c d f ρ w a s u b v v w v v w 2 m d 1 2 c d f r 2 ρ w a s u b ω ω where c d f is the drag force coefficient ρ w is the water density and a s u b is submerged area v is the velocity of the ice floe and v w is the water velocity r is the mean distance between the centroid and each vertex of floe and ω is the angular velocity of the ice floe the buoyancy pressure shown in eq 3 acts on the floe surface so that the heave roll and pitch have a hydrodynamic restoring force and moments for the application of buoyancy in a heeled situation due to roll or pitch the pressure is applied against the local x y coordinate system of the corresponding surface pressure is also applied to the sides of the floe to account for the large angular movement as shown in fig 3 3 p x y z ρ w g h x y z where x y and z are the local coordinates for the surface g is the gravitational acceleration and h is the vertical displacement of a given position with respect to its initial position the added mass was included in the form of a constant value and was taken into consideration by multiplying the mass by 1 c m in the motion equations the added mass coefficient in the simulation was 0 41 with reference to newman 1977 2 3 modeling of ice structure interaction since individual ice floe was handled as rigid body in this study the penetration between colliding objects was allowed in order to consider the deformation of the floe the penetration characteristics was defined as pressure penetration relation this contact model was converted from the contact model using the linear spring which is mainly used in the discrete element method hopkins and shen 2001 sun and shen 2012 liu and ji 2018 the difference is that instead of force pressure is introduced to minimize the effect of the shape of the contact surface for efficiency of computation similar to the linear spring a linear pressure penetration curve was assumed passing through the origin the slope of the calculated curve is 35 367 pa m which was obtained by linear regression analysis on the results of a series of detailed analyses based on the mechanical properties of ice used in the numerical simulation of kim et al 2015 however since the assumptions are just simple approximations which do not reflect complicated ice failure mechanisms further studies are required for the application of reasonable pressure penetration relation for example an average pressure area relationship which can be found in iso 19906 can be converted to an average pressure penetration relationship iso 2010 an alternative would be to use a fixed nominal global crushing pressure such as 1 5 mpa for real ice masterson and frederking 1993 3 calibration of the drag force coefficient prior to the simulation for the model test the drag force coefficient which is one of the key parameters used in sea ice interaction modeling was determined via a calibration process where a comparison was made with the results of the detailed fluid structure interaction analysis the drag force coefficient was adjusted so that the behaviors of the ice floes in fluid structure analysis and the simplified analysis match each other well for detailed fluid structure interaction analysis the same cel method used in ice structure interaction analysis was employed as shown in fig 4 a sea water was modeled as a eulerian mesh and both the ice and ship were modeled as a rigid lagrangian mesh the test was carried out with a small number of ice floes on a small tank for numerical efficiency the tank was 1 7 m in length and width and 0 5 m deep the ice concentration was 40 and the speed of the ship was 0 357 m s the floes were 0 057 m thick and shaped randomly into convex polygons with four sides the mesh size for sea water was determined to be 1 3 of the ice thickness for a detailed description to prevent movement of ice floes because of the pressure gradient of fluid in front of the moving vessel the interaction between sea water and the ship was not taken into account simplified analysis using the proposed method was performed under the same conditions and the results were compared to derive the proper drag force coefficient four ice floes near the ship whose motion responses are expected to be significant were selected for the comparison as shown in fig 5 because the shape of the projected frontal area of each ice floe is different and it changes continuously as the floes changes its direction a single representative value that can cover all situations is required therefore the drag force coefficient producing results closest to the detailed analysis was selected after performing some parametric studies by trial and error the determined drag force coefficient was 5 25 and produced reasonably good results the positions and velocities for each ice floe and the vessel over time were compared fig 6 displays the position change of ice floes in 2d space together with the vessel path and figs 7 and 8 show the velocity in the x and y directions respectively the positions of the ice floes matched each other fairly well particularly during the early stages of drift after collision the same trend can be observed for the velocity plots of figs 7 and 8 showing that the correspondence between the two cases is relatively good during the early stages of drift after collision for the simulation for 6 s the detailed analysis took 7 h and 58 min whereas the analysis using the proposed model took only 2 min and 20 s therefore the proposed model has a great advantage in terms of saving analysis time 4 model tests model tests were conducted in an ice tank at the korea research institute of ships and ocean engineering kriso the kriso ice model basin uses eg ad cd model ice where eg ad and cd denote the ethylene glycol aliphatic detergent and controlled density respectively and the crystal structure of model ice is a columnar type the preparation of the model ice sheet begins with a wet seeding procedure after cooling the model ice is grown at 18 0 5 c and the growth rate is approximately 2 1 mm h during freezing in particular micro bubbles will be discharged uniformly from the bottom of the ice model basin to control the density of model ice after the freezing phase the air temperature will be increased to 2 c to control the strength of the model ice fig 9 shows the preparation procedures for the kriso ice model basin jeong et al 2017 and cho et al 2013 presented the detailed model test procedure model tests were formed in the kriso ice model basin using a 1 18 667 scale mode ship of the korean icebreaking research vessel ibrv araon fig 10 shows the bow and stern parts of the model ship respectively the design requirements for the araon was for a 1 0 m thickness of level ice with a flexural strength of not less than 630 kpa at a speed of 3 knots table 1 lists the main particulars and model ice properties the model tests were carried out by towing a model ship with three different constant speeds 0 119 0 357 and 0 595 m s in model scale 1 3 and 5 kts in full scale through the pack ice channels these channels were covered by an irregular shape of ice floes and two different ice concentrations 60 and 80 were considered as shown in fig 11 fig 12 shows the ice model test process under 80 pack ice conditions with a speed of 0 357 m s in this study the model test results were compared with the corresponding results obtained from a numerical simulation to validate the accuracy of the proposed method table 2 lists the test conditions for comparing the results 5 numerical simulation numerical simulations were carried out using the proposed model under the same conditions as the model test fig 13 shows the analysis model which is composed of the vessel channel wall and ice floes to model the ice floes as close as possible with those used in the model test the maximum and minimum size of the ice floes used in the model test were selected from the test photographs and ice floes were then generated to have a random distribution between these two sizes each ice floe was modeled as a randomly shaped quadrangle fig 14 shows the probability distribution of the mass of the randomly generated ice floes for the 60 and 80 concentration cases the probability distributions of both cases were similar to each other fig 15 shows the distribution of the apex angles of the floes which is defined as illustrated in the figure the angles were distributed from 30 to 170 centered at 90 for both cases rigid walls were modeled considering the width and length of the channel used in the experiment therefore when the ship passed the 2 3 point of the channel the motion of the ice floes was affected by the wall of the channel so the measured data after the point were not used in the result comparison fig 16 shows snapshots of the simulation at t 0 s and t 30 s under a 60 and 80 concentration for a 0 357 m s velocity condition respectively fig 17 presents magnified snapshots of the interaction between the ice floes and the ship hull for the case of an 80 concentration figs 18 and 19 show the distribution of the number of impacts according to the position on the ship with respect to the longitudinal and transverse directions respectively the longitudinal distribution shows that more than half of the total impacts were concentrated on the bow part of the ship whereas the transverse distribution shows impacts concentrated at the center and both sides of the bow it can be observed that there are more impacts to the right of the bow despite being straight ahead it is thought that this is because the analysis time is short if the analysis time is long enough it is expected to show a nearly symmetrical distribution fig 20 shows the set of locations of the impacts in plan view the small dots are the nodal points of the ship mesh and the red circle represents the location where ice impacts are highly populated the red circles are the points that experienced the upper 50 of ice impacts fig 21 shows the locations of the impacts in elevation view in the height direction more than half of the total impacts were concentrated near the draft line of the bow as expected figs 22 and 23 show the time histories of the simulations under 60 and 80 concentration respectively to exclude the initial transient section of the analysis the data from 8 to 30 s in the case of 60 concentration and from 17 to 50 s in the case of 80 concentration were used to calculate the average these two time instances for data selection were chosen because they are the time instances when the first major load drops took place figs 24 and 25 compare the results of the model test with the simulation in terms of the average ice load under the concentration of 60 and 80 respectively the results show that ice impact forces increase with increasing ice concentration and ship velocity as expected in the case of the 60 ice concentration both results compare quite well whereas some deviations were observed for 0 119 and 0 595 m sec ship velocity under the 80 concentration 6 conclusions this paper proposed a novel numerical simulation method using fem for ice impacts on a ship hull in broken ice fields based on the study results using
