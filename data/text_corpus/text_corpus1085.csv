5425,high quality remotely sensed soil moisture sm with high temporal coverage high variation capturing ability and high accuracy is very important to agricultural hydrological and environmental applications the essential climate variable ecv sm dataset is the first product attempting to address the continuity and reliability issues of individual sm sensors by using multi satellite observations but limitations in quality still persist this study proposes a two step fusion framework to obtain high temporal coverage high variation capturing ability and high accuracy remotely sensed sm the first step aims to improve the temporal coverage by filling the gaps of remotely sensed sm with a machine learning method the second step aims to improve the variation capturing ability and accuracy of the high temporal coverage sm from first step using a cumulative distribution function cdf matching based fusion method we chose the ecv and fengyun fy sm products as an algorithm test to improve the quality of ecv sm over the tibetan plateau tp results suggest that the two step sm fusion framework improved the original ecv sm temporal coverage from 30 84 to 78 12 for the entire tp the variation capturing ability here expressed in terms of correlation coefficient r was also improved by 6 and 49 at naqu and maqu respectively compared with the high temporal coverage ecv sm the accuracy measured in terms of unbiased root mean square error ubrmse was also improved hence the fusion framework and the fy sm could effectively improve the quality of ecv sm the high quality fused sm is expected to help us better understand the role of sm in the water and energy cycles under global change keywords soil moisture remote sensing cumulative distribution function ecv sm fy sm tibetan plateau 1 introduction soil moisture sm is a key variable in the water and energy exchanges between land surface and atmosphere mccoll et al 2017 although there are several sm products based on satellite observations or land surface models chen et al 2013a b zeng et al 2015 satellite based sm products are generally preferred since they provide direct measurements over large areas reichle et al 2009 however the insufficient quality of remotely sensed sm products in terms of temporal coverage variation capturing ability and accuracy limits their use in climate change weather forecasting and data assimilation studies su et al 2003 dorigo et al 2017 the temporal coverage of sm impacts its applicability in long term climate change monitoring while the high variation capturing ability and high accuracy sm will benefit the numerical weather prediction and flood forecast respectively entekhabi et al 2010a the temporal coverage of a sm product expressed as the fraction of the total number of valid days within the observation period can be improved with an image based method or an auxiliary information based method cui et al 2016 simple interpolation such as linear and parabolic interpolation is a widely used image based gap filling method since no additional information is needed as a multi satellite merged sm product the newest sm product of the essential climate variable ecv v04 4 has better temporal coverage than single satellite based product zeng et al 2015 however the temporal coverage of the ecv sm product is still as low as 20 in the central and western tibetan plateau tp fig 1 a and varies a lot throughout the year fig 1b since surface sm changes dramatically the image based simple interpolation method is unreliable cui et al 2016 in comparison the auxiliary information based reconstruction method would be a better choice the gap filling or reconstruction process is inevitably accompanied with information loss which degrades the accuracy of the reconstructed sm product data fusion is a promising approach for obtaining a comprehensive sm product with enhanced accuracy the cumulative distribution function cdf matching based fusion is a widely used sm fusion method liu et al 2011 2012 it has been applied to produce the ecv sm dataset and has been validated in different areas of the world liu et al 2011 reichle and koster 2004 however a spatial sampling window e g with 2 degree radius has to be used to estimate the cdf for the fusion because only a few observations are available as a result the representative error was introduced see section 4 1 reichle and koster 2004 to reduce the errors the data fusion at the grid scale on a yearly basis should be implemented so that the robustness of the fusion method can be improved in this study we propose a two step fusion framework for improving the ecv sm dataset by fusing the fengyun fy sm products over the tibetan plateau 2 study area and materials 2 1 study area the tibetan plateau is called the third pole of the world and ranges from 73 4 e to 104 7 e and 26 5 n to 39 6 n fig 2 in this area the average elevation is about 4000 m above sea level annual precipitation is around 500 mm 75 of which occurs between may and october ma et al 2008 chen et al 2013a b yang 2013 2 2 ground data two in situ soil moisture networks were selected to validate our results the first network was established since 2010 and located in a place named naqu in central tp tp smtmn which has cold and semiarid climate and with an altitude of about 4300 m yang et al 2013 the area is mostly covered by alpine grassland comprising prairie grasses and meadows the relatively low aboveground biomass makes it an ideal site for the evaluation of satellite sm products chen et al 2013a b the main sensors used in the network are ec tm capacitance probes that can only measure liquid water content with an accuracy of 0 03 cm3 cm 3 therefore the total water content in frozen soil is not counted for more information about this network readers are kindly referred to yang et al 2013 the spatially averaged in situ measurements collected between 1 january 2012 and 31 december 2014 from 41 stations fig 2 are used as the ground truth for validation these ground truth observations are distributed in 8 adjacent grids of 0 25 0 25 the same size as the pixel of ecv and fy sm products and each grid contains at least 3 stations table 1 grid l22 has 14 stations and was used as the dense grid to validate the results separately the second network locates in maqu in the north eastern part of the tp it has a cold and humid climate with data available since july 2008 su et al 2011 this network consists of 20 stations and covers an area of approximately 40 km 80 km however due to the uneven distribution and discontinuous observations of these stations only one valid grid is used which covers three continuous observations during 2012 2014 table 1 for more details about the maqu network readers are kindly referred to su et al 2011 2 3 remote sensing data 2 3 1 ecv sm product the global ecv sm product has been generated using active and passive microwave instruments and spans from 1978 to 2018 it was part of the european space agency s esa water cycle multi mission observation strategy wacmos and soil moisture climate change initiative cci projects wagner et al 2012 data from about 10 active and passive microwave sensors was used in the development of three ecv sm products the first one is an active product and was created by merging active sm observations from active microwave instrument ami and advanced scatterometer ascat a b after retrieval using a change detection method wagner et al 2013 1999 the second one is a passive product which was created by merging all passive sm observations scanning multichannel microwave radiometer smmr special sensor microwave imager ssm i trmm microwave imager tmi advanced microwave scanning radiometer earth observing system amsr e windsat radiometer windsat soil moisture and ocean salinity smos advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 amsr2 after retrieval using the land parameter retrieval model lprm owe et al 2008 the third one is a combined sm product obtained by merging all active and passive sm observations directly wagner et al 2012 through temporal resampling spatial resampling cdf based rescaling and triple collocation analysis based merging in this study we used the combined product version 04 4 of smos passive ascending 6 00 am local solar time amsr2 passive descending 1 30 am local solar time ascat a active descending 9 30 am local solar time and gldas noah modeled 0 00 utc during 2012 2014 it provides daily surface sm to a soil depth of 10 cm at a spatial resolution of 0 25 it has to be noted that only night time sm observations from the radiometers were used for the combined sm product because the lprm passive retrieval algorithm performs better with night time more often the descending mode observations than with day time ones often the ascending mode this is the main reason for the large number of gaps in the merged product especially during winter spring and autumn when land surface temperature lst is often below 0 during night time and the soil is frozen due to the strict merging algorithm and different satellite observation times the gaps in the ecv product are still large especially when the soil is frozen for more information about the ecv sm product please see http www esa cci org 2 3 2 fy sm product the fy 3b microwave radiation imager fy 3b mwri is a radiometer operating since november 2010 onboard the fy 3b satellite of the china meteorological administration cui et al 2016 the fy 3b mwri sensor has five passive microwave bands ranging from 10 65 to 89 ghz with hh vv polarization with daily ascending 13 40 local solar time and descending 01 40 local solar time overpasses to obtain sm an algorithm used by nasa s amsr e sm product was adopted using observations of 10 7 and 18 7 ghz parinussa et al 2014 which eliminates the effect of vegetation and surface roughness njoku et al 2003 a parameterized surface emission model for bare surface soil named q p model is used to improve the performance of retrieval algorithm shi et al 2006 the spatial resolution of the fy sm product is 0 25 and the measurement depth is about 1 cm in this study we selected the daily ascending product fy sm which is not incorporated in the original ecv products since the lst is highest during daytime in transit of satellites the ascending fy sm has fewer gaps than other satellite based sm products additionally this product was validated in our previous study and performs well when the vegetation cover is low cui et al 2016 2 3 3 remote sensing auxiliary data the auxiliary remote sensing data in this research include moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis 8 day normalized difference vegetation index ndvi product as well as the daily modis lst 8 day modis albedo and a digital elevation model dem all these modis products have a 1 km spatial resolution and were reconstructed using the method proposed by cui et al 2016 to eliminate the impact of clouds the dem was from shuttle radar topography mission srtm with a resolution of 90 m all of the auxiliary data were resampled to a spatial resolution of 0 25 using moving average algorithm 3 methods to improve the temporal coverage and accuracy of the ecv sm product a two step fusion framework was proposed fig 3 in the first step the sm reconstruction method was employed to obtain high temporal coverage sm under unfrozen soil conditions in the second step the cdf matching based fusion was implemented to improve the variation capturing ability and accuracy of the high temporal coverage sm the core of this method is implementing the cdf matching based fusion at pixel and yearly scale which is helpful to improve the stability of the cdf and the fused sm quality accordingly 3 1 original sm product reconstruction the gaps in the original ecv sm ecv ori sm and fy sm fy ori sm products were filled using a machine learning method with the reconstructed auxiliary data the method is based on cui et al 2016 using a general regression neural network grnn instead of the back propagation neural network bpnn after removing the day of year doy in the inputs to improve the stability in the case of sparse training data as a kind of radial basis function neural network the grnn is often used for function approximation to solve regression problems which transforms the low dimension input data to high dimensional space for data regression so that the network can be more efficient and robust especially when the training data is sparse previous studies have shown that the grnn has greater advantages over the bpnn in the ability to approach and learning speed ding et al 2014 we also found that the grnn captures the variation better in the data than the bpnn with the same configuration as in cui et al 2016 results not shown hence in this study we used a grnn package integrated in the matlab software by setting the spread of the radial basis functions to 0 05 the grnn was trained using the samples of the original ecv fy sm that had a valid value and then the trained grnn was applied to predict sm where the soil was unfrozen and not covered by snow this process was able to improve the temporal coverage of both ecv ori sm and fy ori sm due to remote sensing sensor can only observe soil water in the liquid state the strong relationship between sm and auxiliary data is only found when the soil is unfrozen hence the reconstruction algorithm was applied only over unfrozen soil where lst was higher than 273 k and albedo was lower than 0 3 the proposed grnn algorithm uses six parameters as input auxiliary data hence if the variation of one parameter such as the ndvi is not able to indicate the variation of sm the other parameters will play a major role together and the process can be described by internal parameters of the hidden layers in the grnn for an example as we know in a certain ndvi condition the lst is always used to retrieve sm petropoulos et al 2009 3 2 cdf matching based fusion after the original sm product is reconstructed sufficient samples can be obtained to calculate the cdf at the pixel scale hence the cdf matching based sm fusion was performed on each pixel using yearly data which is a major difference from the previous studies liu et al 2012 2011 reichle and koster 2004 this can improve the stability of the cdf estimation and reduced the statistical noises caused by the representative error which increases with the spatial and temporal scales reichle and koster 2004 the reconstructed fy sm fy rec sm was rescaled against the reconstructed ecv sm ecv rec sm using the piece wise linear cdf matching technique liu et al 2011 and then the two products were fused according to the following steps 1 for each cdf curve grid by grid and year by year we identified the 0 5 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 95 and 100 percentiles 2 we used the 13 percentiles of the cdf curves to define 12 segments 3 the 13 percentile values from the fy rec sm cdf curves were plotted against the reconstructed ecv rec sm and the scaling parameters of the linear equations slope and intercept between two consecutive percentiles were computed as 1 slope i e c v r e c i 1 e c v r e c i f y r e c i 1 f y r e c i 2 intercept i e c v r e c i f y r e c i slope i where i 1 2 12 is the number of the segments and e c r e c i 1 is the percentile of the ecv rec sm and fy i 1 is the percentile of fy rec sm 4 the obtained linear equations were used to scale all the observations of the fy rec sm to the ecv rec sm as 3 f y r e s r e c r slope i f y r e c intercept i where fy resrecr is the rescaled fy rec sm slope i and intercept i were chosen according to the fy rec sm value and its corresponding percentile since there were no data outside of the range of the cdf curves after the reconstruction process the cdf could match perfectly 5 data fusion the ecv rec sm and fy resrec sm were fused using the simple arithmetic average method because there was not enough evidence to prove which was better additionally it was very difficult to estimate the weight pixel by pixel hence as a compromise we used the simple arithmetic average weight is 0 5 0 5 for both products in the fusion process for pixels where the ecv rec product had a valid value and the fy resrec product did not we only used the ecv rec product as the fused sm to ensure temporal coverage for pixels where the ecv rec product had no available values no action was taken 3 3 error metrics the classical statistical error metrics including the correlation coefficient r the unbiased root mean square error ubrmse bias and temporal coverage tc were calculated to quantify the level of agreement between the remotely sensed sm products and the in situ measurements entekhabi et al 2010a the tc r and ubrmse were used to quantify the temporal coverage variation capturing ability and accuracy respectively entekhabi et al 2010a the p value was also used to determine the significance level the small p value e g 0 05 or 0 01 means that the correlation is not a coincidence these metrics are defined as follows 4 tc i 1 n day valid s m i 1 n day all 100 5 r i 1 n s m m s m m s m o s m o i 1 n s m m s m m 2 s m o s m o 2 6 ubrmse rms e 2 b i a s 2 7 bias 1 n i 1 n s m m s m o 8 rmse 1 n i 1 n s m m s m o 2 where day valid sm and day all are the sm valid days and all observations days respectively s m m is the estimated sm s m o is the observed or original sm s m m is the average of the estimated sm s m o is the average of the observed or original sm and n is the number of observations 4 results and discussion 4 1 cdf matching based fusion analysis ecv ori and fy ori sm were reconstructed using the grnn method and rescaled using the cdf matching method from 2012 to 2014 grid by grid and year by year then the rescaled sm products were fused by calculating the simple arithmetic average between the two datasets fig 4 illustrates the process where one point the dense grid was selected to show the detailed information about the cdf matching based sm fusion there was a substantial difference between the ecv ori sm and fy ori sm either in the temporal distribution or in the absolute value fig 4 a b providing a good complementary basis for data fusion as a multi satellite product ecv ori sm had higher temporal coverage than fy ori sm from may to october however due to the satellite overpass time and improved algorithm for bare soil shi et al 2006 fy ori sm had high temporal coverage during the non growing period from november to april of the following year and was also in better agreement with the in situ measurements see section 4 2 after the reconstruction process the overlapping periods of the reconstructed sm product were significantly much longer than that of ecv ori sm and fy ori sm the periods of overlapping data in which both products had valid values were improved from only about 87 days per year for the sm ori products fig 4 a b to about 333 days for the reconstructed products in the example fig 4 c and d improved overlapping periods could enhance the stability and representativeness of the cdf matching moreover the fused product had high temporal coverage and low uncertainty during the non growing period there were more observations taking part in the reconstruction process of fy ori sm than of ecv ori sm leading to less uncertainty in the fy rec sm than in ecv rec sm in addition the rescaling process only changed the absolute value but not the temporal variation of input fig 4 d and e hence by integrating the characteristics of two sm products the fused product had reduced uncertainty especially during the non growing period fig 5 shows how in this study the cdf matching approach was implemented to rescale the original and reconstructed fy sm against ecv sm from 2012 to 2014 it is clear that the cdf varied for different products after the sm reconstruction process the cdf also changed accordingly this means that the original sparse observations might result in a large deviation of cdf estimation this method could make the cdf match perfectly the cdf curves of different years show great differences as shown in fig 6 this variation was mainly caused by the seasonal and annual variations of sm the difference between the original sm cdf and the reconstructed sm cdf mainly occurred in areas with high sm larger than 0 2 cm3 cm 3 fig 6 a d where the growing season was starting this indicates that the cdf variation in different years was also related to the satellite observation and retrieval algorithm 4 2 evaluation of the fused product against in situ data in this section the fused sm in the naqu and maqu networks were analyzed separately four error metrics tc r bias and ubrmse were used to quantify the quality of the sm products since the reconstruction process had already distinguished the frozen unfrozen state of the soil here the frozen and unfrozen periods were not separated and the results only represent the performance of the soil in an unfrozen state liquid water three years of in situ observations were used to reveal the robustness of the proposed fusion framework in our two step fusion framework the first step aims to improve the temporal coverage from original sm to reconstructed sm and the second step aims to improve the variation capturing ability and accuracy of the high temporal coverage sm from the reconstructed sm to fused sm hence the detailed results are described step by step here below 4 2 1 improvements between the reconstructed and original sm in the first step we chose the dense grid of the naqu network as an example four error metrics of tc r bias and ubrmse of the original and reconstructed ecv and fy sm against in situ measurements were calculated table 2 results showed that the temporal coverage was improved from 44 20 and 41 33 and of the original sm to 91 24 and 91 24 of the reconstructed ecv and fy sm respectively comparing the pixels where both original and reconstructed sm are available against the in situ measurements we found that the reconstructed ecv and fy sm had comparable variation capturing ability and accuracy with the respective original sm table 2 however as the temporal coverage increased the variation capturing ability of ecv rec sm decreased significantly but not for the fy rec sm the main reason for this is that the distribution of the original ecv sm was more uneven than that of the original fy sm the ecv ori sm has little data from october to may of the following year this uneven distribution might reduce the performance of the trained grnn model for the limited representation of training data in this period it is worth mentioning that the huge difference in the number of samples between the original and reconstructed sm does now allow for a fair comparison of other statistical metrics the original sm recovering ability of the proposed two step framework was also tested we also chose the dense grid of the naqu network as an example and treated random 0 10 20 100 of the soil moisture data set for both fy and ecv as truth and eliminated them when 0 was set meaning that all pixels were truth and no pixel was eliminated and when 100 was set meaning that all pixels were eliminated and the grnn was trained using the adjacent pixels in the 2 2 grid the correlation coefficient r and rmse were calculated between the reconstructed sm and the truth and the average results are shown in fig 7 after ten repetitions the results showed that the two step fusion framework has acceptable sm recovering ability the sm recovering ability decreased as the number of eliminated pixels increased ecv and fy had different recovering ability the ecv sm had lower r and lower rmse than fy sm meaning that the reconstructed ecv sm has a lower variation capturing ability and higher accuracy than the reconstructed fy sm this indicates that there is still much room for improvement in the variation capturing ability of the ecv rec sm 4 2 2 improvements between the fused and reconstructed sm in the second step improving the variation capturing ability r and accuracy ubrmse based on the first step were the main objectives the validation results against the in situ measurements at the naqu network are shown in table 3 the ecv rec sm has high accuracy and a little underestimate as the ecv ori sm while the fy rec sm has a high variation capturing ability and a small overestimation compared to fy ori sm this was consistent with the finding in section 4 2 1 the r between the fused sm and in situ measurements ranged from 0 703 p 0 01 to 0 840 p 0 01 for the eight grids it was much higher than the r between the ecv rec sm and in situ measurements which ranged from 0 607 p 0 01 to 0 804 p 0 01 compared with the ecv rec sm the averaged r for the fused sm was improved by about 6 additionally the r of the fused sm was higher than that of ecv rec sm for all grids table 3 indicating that the fused sm had a stable higher consistency with the in situ measurements than the ecv rec sm the dynamic range of ubrmse for fused sm was between 0 043 and 0 095 cm3 cm 3 which was slightly improved compared to the ecv rec sm which ranged from 0 046 to 0 097 cm3 cm 3 the averaged ubrmse of the fused sm is slightly lower than that of the ecv rec sm and much lower than that of fy rec sm meanwhile r was improved and ubrmse was reduced in all grids to explore more detail information the improvements in r and ubrmse from ecv rec sm to fused sm at 1 year scale in all grids for naqu network were calculated the improvements in r ranged from 0 002 to 0 19 or from 0 02 to 39 and improvements in ubrmse ranged from 0 0002 to 0 009 cm3 cm 3 or from 0 4 to 17 the student s t test was also adopted to test whether these improvements were significant and results showed that r were significantly improved p 0 05 however the improvements in ubrmse were not significant for its distribution was far away from the normal distribution which is necessary to student s t test from 1 year to 3 year scale all indicators indicated that the fused sm inherited the advantages of fy rec sm in its variation capturing ability and of ecv rec sm in its accuracy for the maqu network with cold and humid climate the proposed two step fusion framework had a similar performance as for the naqu network with cold and semi arid climate tables 3 and 4 while the fused sm variation capturing ability was significantly improved by about 49 p 0 01 compared to the ecv rec sm the fused sm accuracy was also slightly improved it is noteworthy that the original ecv product had a worse performance in this climate region than in naqu both ecv rec sm and fused sm were close to the 1 1 line except for maqu and had various inconsistencies from grid to grid fig 8 in most cases the fused sm was closer to the 1 1 line than ecv rec sm especially for grid l22 and l43 improvements were found when the in situ sm is 0 2 cm3 cm 3 and there is less overestimation in the fused sm than in the ecv rec sm for all grids to show more information of variation the time series of ecv rec sm fy rec sm and fused sm were compared to the in situ observations over the dense grid from fig 9 it is clear that the fused sm performed better in capturing the temporal dynamics of in situ sm than other ecv rec sm where fy rec overestimated sm and ecv rec had strong uncertainty between july and september it seems that the fused sm inherited the advantages of stability during the period from october to the following june from fy rec sm and of having comparable absolute values between july and september from ecv rec sm some studies have pointed out that in situ measurements and few point measurements are only able to reproduce the temporal dynamics of sm but not the absolute values wagner et al 2013 obtaining a high r is also the objective of the ecv sm product hence the two step fusion framework proposed here is an endeavor to this object together with accuracy and temporal coverage were also improved 4 3 analysis of temporal coverage of sm over the tp the temporal coverage of ecv ori sm fy ori sm and fused sm are shown in fig 10 compared with the ecv ori sm temporal coverage of the fused product was improved from 30 84 to 78 12 for the entire tp in the remaining 21 88 no data area corresponds to regions that the soil was frozen it is worth noting that the temporal coverage was related to the classification of whether the soil was unfrozen or not in this study the soil was defined as unfrozen where lst was higher than 273 k and the albedo was lower than 0 3 based on prior research cui et al 2016 in the future a more accurate freeze thaw discrimination method could be considered such as a microwave observation based method rattanadecho 2004 the ecv ori sm had higher temporal coverage than fy ori sm over the entire tp as expected unfortunately the temporal coverage of ecv ori sm was still very low over the tp the main reasons for this was that 1 the fused soil moisture products were from satellite observations at night time and 2 the tc based merging algorithm of ecv sm needs three products a day otherwise the algorithm fails liu et al 2011 the ecv product has a long term record and is useful for studying inter annual variability however the lower temporal coverage and non uniform distribution samples present a huge challenge differences between the annual average ecv ori sm and the fused sm ranged from 0 08 cm3 cm 3 to 0 08 cm3 cm 3 compared with the high coverage of fused ecv sm the ecv ori sm significantly overestimated the sm over most parts of the tp fig 11 the sm product data gaps were the main reason for this overestimation especially during the non growing period all these differences caution us that high data consistency is an important basis for data analysis especially at long term scales hence the fused product could be much more reliable in terms of coverage for data analysis at both seasonal and inter annual scales 5 conclusions this study proposed a two step sm fusion framework combining a machine learning based reconstruction and a cdf matching based fusion method to enhance the quality of the original ecv sm dataset over the tp this method not only inherited the advantages of both methods but also eliminated their shortcomings the cdf matching based fusion method is limited by the representative error due to the expanded spatio temporal scales of implementation and the machine learning based reconstruction process provides the possibility to overcome this disadvantage by improving the temporal coverage the two step sm fusion framework was tested using ecv and fy products over the tp and results showed that the temporal coverage variation capturing ability and accuracy of the fused sm were improved greatly the framework described in this paper could be extended to other products like smap entekhabi et al 2010a the result sm product of high quality is expected to help further understand the role of sm in the water and energy cycles in this study the fusion of ecv and fy sm was only evaluated over the tp with limited in situ measurements future studies using the two step sm fusion framework under a wider range of environmental conditions are needed to evaluate whether this framework can provide more accurate sm and the utility of the sm fusion framework on other satellite based sm products could be further

5425,high quality remotely sensed soil moisture sm with high temporal coverage high variation capturing ability and high accuracy is very important to agricultural hydrological and environmental applications the essential climate variable ecv sm dataset is the first product attempting to address the continuity and reliability issues of individual sm sensors by using multi satellite observations but limitations in quality still persist this study proposes a two step fusion framework to obtain high temporal coverage high variation capturing ability and high accuracy remotely sensed sm the first step aims to improve the temporal coverage by filling the gaps of remotely sensed sm with a machine learning method the second step aims to improve the variation capturing ability and accuracy of the high temporal coverage sm from first step using a cumulative distribution function cdf matching based fusion method we chose the ecv and fengyun fy sm products as an algorithm test to improve the quality of ecv sm over the tibetan plateau tp results suggest that the two step sm fusion framework improved the original ecv sm temporal coverage from 30 84 to 78 12 for the entire tp the variation capturing ability here expressed in terms of correlation coefficient r was also improved by 6 and 49 at naqu and maqu respectively compared with the high temporal coverage ecv sm the accuracy measured in terms of unbiased root mean square error ubrmse was also improved hence the fusion framework and the fy sm could effectively improve the quality of ecv sm the high quality fused sm is expected to help us better understand the role of sm in the water and energy cycles under global change keywords soil moisture remote sensing cumulative distribution function ecv sm fy sm tibetan plateau 1 introduction soil moisture sm is a key variable in the water and energy exchanges between land surface and atmosphere mccoll et al 2017 although there are several sm products based on satellite observations or land surface models chen et al 2013a b zeng et al 2015 satellite based sm products are generally preferred since they provide direct measurements over large areas reichle et al 2009 however the insufficient quality of remotely sensed sm products in terms of temporal coverage variation capturing ability and accuracy limits their use in climate change weather forecasting and data assimilation studies su et al 2003 dorigo et al 2017 the temporal coverage of sm impacts its applicability in long term climate change monitoring while the high variation capturing ability and high accuracy sm will benefit the numerical weather prediction and flood forecast respectively entekhabi et al 2010a the temporal coverage of a sm product expressed as the fraction of the total number of valid days within the observation period can be improved with an image based method or an auxiliary information based method cui et al 2016 simple interpolation such as linear and parabolic interpolation is a widely used image based gap filling method since no additional information is needed as a multi satellite merged sm product the newest sm product of the essential climate variable ecv v04 4 has better temporal coverage than single satellite based product zeng et al 2015 however the temporal coverage of the ecv sm product is still as low as 20 in the central and western tibetan plateau tp fig 1 a and varies a lot throughout the year fig 1b since surface sm changes dramatically the image based simple interpolation method is unreliable cui et al 2016 in comparison the auxiliary information based reconstruction method would be a better choice the gap filling or reconstruction process is inevitably accompanied with information loss which degrades the accuracy of the reconstructed sm product data fusion is a promising approach for obtaining a comprehensive sm product with enhanced accuracy the cumulative distribution function cdf matching based fusion is a widely used sm fusion method liu et al 2011 2012 it has been applied to produce the ecv sm dataset and has been validated in different areas of the world liu et al 2011 reichle and koster 2004 however a spatial sampling window e g with 2 degree radius has to be used to estimate the cdf for the fusion because only a few observations are available as a result the representative error was introduced see section 4 1 reichle and koster 2004 to reduce the errors the data fusion at the grid scale on a yearly basis should be implemented so that the robustness of the fusion method can be improved in this study we propose a two step fusion framework for improving the ecv sm dataset by fusing the fengyun fy sm products over the tibetan plateau 2 study area and materials 2 1 study area the tibetan plateau is called the third pole of the world and ranges from 73 4 e to 104 7 e and 26 5 n to 39 6 n fig 2 in this area the average elevation is about 4000 m above sea level annual precipitation is around 500 mm 75 of which occurs between may and october ma et al 2008 chen et al 2013a b yang 2013 2 2 ground data two in situ soil moisture networks were selected to validate our results the first network was established since 2010 and located in a place named naqu in central tp tp smtmn which has cold and semiarid climate and with an altitude of about 4300 m yang et al 2013 the area is mostly covered by alpine grassland comprising prairie grasses and meadows the relatively low aboveground biomass makes it an ideal site for the evaluation of satellite sm products chen et al 2013a b the main sensors used in the network are ec tm capacitance probes that can only measure liquid water content with an accuracy of 0 03 cm3 cm 3 therefore the total water content in frozen soil is not counted for more information about this network readers are kindly referred to yang et al 2013 the spatially averaged in situ measurements collected between 1 january 2012 and 31 december 2014 from 41 stations fig 2 are used as the ground truth for validation these ground truth observations are distributed in 8 adjacent grids of 0 25 0 25 the same size as the pixel of ecv and fy sm products and each grid contains at least 3 stations table 1 grid l22 has 14 stations and was used as the dense grid to validate the results separately the second network locates in maqu in the north eastern part of the tp it has a cold and humid climate with data available since july 2008 su et al 2011 this network consists of 20 stations and covers an area of approximately 40 km 80 km however due to the uneven distribution and discontinuous observations of these stations only one valid grid is used which covers three continuous observations during 2012 2014 table 1 for more details about the maqu network readers are kindly referred to su et al 2011 2 3 remote sensing data 2 3 1 ecv sm product the global ecv sm product has been generated using active and passive microwave instruments and spans from 1978 to 2018 it was part of the european space agency s esa water cycle multi mission observation strategy wacmos and soil moisture climate change initiative cci projects wagner et al 2012 data from about 10 active and passive microwave sensors was used in the development of three ecv sm products the first one is an active product and was created by merging active sm observations from active microwave instrument ami and advanced scatterometer ascat a b after retrieval using a change detection method wagner et al 2013 1999 the second one is a passive product which was created by merging all passive sm observations scanning multichannel microwave radiometer smmr special sensor microwave imager ssm i trmm microwave imager tmi advanced microwave scanning radiometer earth observing system amsr e windsat radiometer windsat soil moisture and ocean salinity smos advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 amsr2 after retrieval using the land parameter retrieval model lprm owe et al 2008 the third one is a combined sm product obtained by merging all active and passive sm observations directly wagner et al 2012 through temporal resampling spatial resampling cdf based rescaling and triple collocation analysis based merging in this study we used the combined product version 04 4 of smos passive ascending 6 00 am local solar time amsr2 passive descending 1 30 am local solar time ascat a active descending 9 30 am local solar time and gldas noah modeled 0 00 utc during 2012 2014 it provides daily surface sm to a soil depth of 10 cm at a spatial resolution of 0 25 it has to be noted that only night time sm observations from the radiometers were used for the combined sm product because the lprm passive retrieval algorithm performs better with night time more often the descending mode observations than with day time ones often the ascending mode this is the main reason for the large number of gaps in the merged product especially during winter spring and autumn when land surface temperature lst is often below 0 during night time and the soil is frozen due to the strict merging algorithm and different satellite observation times the gaps in the ecv product are still large especially when the soil is frozen for more information about the ecv sm product please see http www esa cci org 2 3 2 fy sm product the fy 3b microwave radiation imager fy 3b mwri is a radiometer operating since november 2010 onboard the fy 3b satellite of the china meteorological administration cui et al 2016 the fy 3b mwri sensor has five passive microwave bands ranging from 10 65 to 89 ghz with hh vv polarization with daily ascending 13 40 local solar time and descending 01 40 local solar time overpasses to obtain sm an algorithm used by nasa s amsr e sm product was adopted using observations of 10 7 and 18 7 ghz parinussa et al 2014 which eliminates the effect of vegetation and surface roughness njoku et al 2003 a parameterized surface emission model for bare surface soil named q p model is used to improve the performance of retrieval algorithm shi et al 2006 the spatial resolution of the fy sm product is 0 25 and the measurement depth is about 1 cm in this study we selected the daily ascending product fy sm which is not incorporated in the original ecv products since the lst is highest during daytime in transit of satellites the ascending fy sm has fewer gaps than other satellite based sm products additionally this product was validated in our previous study and performs well when the vegetation cover is low cui et al 2016 2 3 3 remote sensing auxiliary data the auxiliary remote sensing data in this research include moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis 8 day normalized difference vegetation index ndvi product as well as the daily modis lst 8 day modis albedo and a digital elevation model dem all these modis products have a 1 km spatial resolution and were reconstructed using the method proposed by cui et al 2016 to eliminate the impact of clouds the dem was from shuttle radar topography mission srtm with a resolution of 90 m all of the auxiliary data were resampled to a spatial resolution of 0 25 using moving average algorithm 3 methods to improve the temporal coverage and accuracy of the ecv sm product a two step fusion framework was proposed fig 3 in the first step the sm reconstruction method was employed to obtain high temporal coverage sm under unfrozen soil conditions in the second step the cdf matching based fusion was implemented to improve the variation capturing ability and accuracy of the high temporal coverage sm the core of this method is implementing the cdf matching based fusion at pixel and yearly scale which is helpful to improve the stability of the cdf and the fused sm quality accordingly 3 1 original sm product reconstruction the gaps in the original ecv sm ecv ori sm and fy sm fy ori sm products were filled using a machine learning method with the reconstructed auxiliary data the method is based on cui et al 2016 using a general regression neural network grnn instead of the back propagation neural network bpnn after removing the day of year doy in the inputs to improve the stability in the case of sparse training data as a kind of radial basis function neural network the grnn is often used for function approximation to solve regression problems which transforms the low dimension input data to high dimensional space for data regression so that the network can be more efficient and robust especially when the training data is sparse previous studies have shown that the grnn has greater advantages over the bpnn in the ability to approach and learning speed ding et al 2014 we also found that the grnn captures the variation better in the data than the bpnn with the same configuration as in cui et al 2016 results not shown hence in this study we used a grnn package integrated in the matlab software by setting the spread of the radial basis functions to 0 05 the grnn was trained using the samples of the original ecv fy sm that had a valid value and then the trained grnn was applied to predict sm where the soil was unfrozen and not covered by snow this process was able to improve the temporal coverage of both ecv ori sm and fy ori sm due to remote sensing sensor can only observe soil water in the liquid state the strong relationship between sm and auxiliary data is only found when the soil is unfrozen hence the reconstruction algorithm was applied only over unfrozen soil where lst was higher than 273 k and albedo was lower than 0 3 the proposed grnn algorithm uses six parameters as input auxiliary data hence if the variation of one parameter such as the ndvi is not able to indicate the variation of sm the other parameters will play a major role together and the process can be described by internal parameters of the hidden layers in the grnn for an example as we know in a certain ndvi condition the lst is always used to retrieve sm petropoulos et al 2009 3 2 cdf matching based fusion after the original sm product is reconstructed sufficient samples can be obtained to calculate the cdf at the pixel scale hence the cdf matching based sm fusion was performed on each pixel using yearly data which is a major difference from the previous studies liu et al 2012 2011 reichle and koster 2004 this can improve the stability of the cdf estimation and reduced the statistical noises caused by the representative error which increases with the spatial and temporal scales reichle and koster 2004 the reconstructed fy sm fy rec sm was rescaled against the reconstructed ecv sm ecv rec sm using the piece wise linear cdf matching technique liu et al 2011 and then the two products were fused according to the following steps 1 for each cdf curve grid by grid and year by year we identified the 0 5 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 95 and 100 percentiles 2 we used the 13 percentiles of the cdf curves to define 12 segments 3 the 13 percentile values from the fy rec sm cdf curves were plotted against the reconstructed ecv rec sm and the scaling parameters of the linear equations slope and intercept between two consecutive percentiles were computed as 1 slope i e c v r e c i 1 e c v r e c i f y r e c i 1 f y r e c i 2 intercept i e c v r e c i f y r e c i slope i where i 1 2 12 is the number of the segments and e c r e c i 1 is the percentile of the ecv rec sm and fy i 1 is the percentile of fy rec sm 4 the obtained linear equations were used to scale all the observations of the fy rec sm to the ecv rec sm as 3 f y r e s r e c r slope i f y r e c intercept i where fy resrecr is the rescaled fy rec sm slope i and intercept i were chosen according to the fy rec sm value and its corresponding percentile since there were no data outside of the range of the cdf curves after the reconstruction process the cdf could match perfectly 5 data fusion the ecv rec sm and fy resrec sm were fused using the simple arithmetic average method because there was not enough evidence to prove which was better additionally it was very difficult to estimate the weight pixel by pixel hence as a compromise we used the simple arithmetic average weight is 0 5 0 5 for both products in the fusion process for pixels where the ecv rec product had a valid value and the fy resrec product did not we only used the ecv rec product as the fused sm to ensure temporal coverage for pixels where the ecv rec product had no available values no action was taken 3 3 error metrics the classical statistical error metrics including the correlation coefficient r the unbiased root mean square error ubrmse bias and temporal coverage tc were calculated to quantify the level of agreement between the remotely sensed sm products and the in situ measurements entekhabi et al 2010a the tc r and ubrmse were used to quantify the temporal coverage variation capturing ability and accuracy respectively entekhabi et al 2010a the p value was also used to determine the significance level the small p value e g 0 05 or 0 01 means that the correlation is not a coincidence these metrics are defined as follows 4 tc i 1 n day valid s m i 1 n day all 100 5 r i 1 n s m m s m m s m o s m o i 1 n s m m s m m 2 s m o s m o 2 6 ubrmse rms e 2 b i a s 2 7 bias 1 n i 1 n s m m s m o 8 rmse 1 n i 1 n s m m s m o 2 where day valid sm and day all are the sm valid days and all observations days respectively s m m is the estimated sm s m o is the observed or original sm s m m is the average of the estimated sm s m o is the average of the observed or original sm and n is the number of observations 4 results and discussion 4 1 cdf matching based fusion analysis ecv ori and fy ori sm were reconstructed using the grnn method and rescaled using the cdf matching method from 2012 to 2014 grid by grid and year by year then the rescaled sm products were fused by calculating the simple arithmetic average between the two datasets fig 4 illustrates the process where one point the dense grid was selected to show the detailed information about the cdf matching based sm fusion there was a substantial difference between the ecv ori sm and fy ori sm either in the temporal distribution or in the absolute value fig 4 a b providing a good complementary basis for data fusion as a multi satellite product ecv ori sm had higher temporal coverage than fy ori sm from may to october however due to the satellite overpass time and improved algorithm for bare soil shi et al 2006 fy ori sm had high temporal coverage during the non growing period from november to april of the following year and was also in better agreement with the in situ measurements see section 4 2 after the reconstruction process the overlapping periods of the reconstructed sm product were significantly much longer than that of ecv ori sm and fy ori sm the periods of overlapping data in which both products had valid values were improved from only about 87 days per year for the sm ori products fig 4 a b to about 333 days for the reconstructed products in the example fig 4 c and d improved overlapping periods could enhance the stability and representativeness of the cdf matching moreover the fused product had high temporal coverage and low uncertainty during the non growing period there were more observations taking part in the reconstruction process of fy ori sm than of ecv ori sm leading to less uncertainty in the fy rec sm than in ecv rec sm in addition the rescaling process only changed the absolute value but not the temporal variation of input fig 4 d and e hence by integrating the characteristics of two sm products the fused product had reduced uncertainty especially during the non growing period fig 5 shows how in this study the cdf matching approach was implemented to rescale the original and reconstructed fy sm against ecv sm from 2012 to 2014 it is clear that the cdf varied for different products after the sm reconstruction process the cdf also changed accordingly this means that the original sparse observations might result in a large deviation of cdf estimation this method could make the cdf match perfectly the cdf curves of different years show great differences as shown in fig 6 this variation was mainly caused by the seasonal and annual variations of sm the difference between the original sm cdf and the reconstructed sm cdf mainly occurred in areas with high sm larger than 0 2 cm3 cm 3 fig 6 a d where the growing season was starting this indicates that the cdf variation in different years was also related to the satellite observation and retrieval algorithm 4 2 evaluation of the fused product against in situ data in this section the fused sm in the naqu and maqu networks were analyzed separately four error metrics tc r bias and ubrmse were used to quantify the quality of the sm products since the reconstruction process had already distinguished the frozen unfrozen state of the soil here the frozen and unfrozen periods were not separated and the results only represent the performance of the soil in an unfrozen state liquid water three years of in situ observations were used to reveal the robustness of the proposed fusion framework in our two step fusion framework the first step aims to improve the temporal coverage from original sm to reconstructed sm and the second step aims to improve the variation capturing ability and accuracy of the high temporal coverage sm from the reconstructed sm to fused sm hence the detailed results are described step by step here below 4 2 1 improvements between the reconstructed and original sm in the first step we chose the dense grid of the naqu network as an example four error metrics of tc r bias and ubrmse of the original and reconstructed ecv and fy sm against in situ measurements were calculated table 2 results showed that the temporal coverage was improved from 44 20 and 41 33 and of the original sm to 91 24 and 91 24 of the reconstructed ecv and fy sm respectively comparing the pixels where both original and reconstructed sm are available against the in situ measurements we found that the reconstructed ecv and fy sm had comparable variation capturing ability and accuracy with the respective original sm table 2 however as the temporal coverage increased the variation capturing ability of ecv rec sm decreased significantly but not for the fy rec sm the main reason for this is that the distribution of the original ecv sm was more uneven than that of the original fy sm the ecv ori sm has little data from october to may of the following year this uneven distribution might reduce the performance of the trained grnn model for the limited representation of training data in this period it is worth mentioning that the huge difference in the number of samples between the original and reconstructed sm does now allow for a fair comparison of other statistical metrics the original sm recovering ability of the proposed two step framework was also tested we also chose the dense grid of the naqu network as an example and treated random 0 10 20 100 of the soil moisture data set for both fy and ecv as truth and eliminated them when 0 was set meaning that all pixels were truth and no pixel was eliminated and when 100 was set meaning that all pixels were eliminated and the grnn was trained using the adjacent pixels in the 2 2 grid the correlation coefficient r and rmse were calculated between the reconstructed sm and the truth and the average results are shown in fig 7 after ten repetitions the results showed that the two step fusion framework has acceptable sm recovering ability the sm recovering ability decreased as the number of eliminated pixels increased ecv and fy had different recovering ability the ecv sm had lower r and lower rmse than fy sm meaning that the reconstructed ecv sm has a lower variation capturing ability and higher accuracy than the reconstructed fy sm this indicates that there is still much room for improvement in the variation capturing ability of the ecv rec sm 4 2 2 improvements between the fused and reconstructed sm in the second step improving the variation capturing ability r and accuracy ubrmse based on the first step were the main objectives the validation results against the in situ measurements at the naqu network are shown in table 3 the ecv rec sm has high accuracy and a little underestimate as the ecv ori sm while the fy rec sm has a high variation capturing ability and a small overestimation compared to fy ori sm this was consistent with the finding in section 4 2 1 the r between the fused sm and in situ measurements ranged from 0 703 p 0 01 to 0 840 p 0 01 for the eight grids it was much higher than the r between the ecv rec sm and in situ measurements which ranged from 0 607 p 0 01 to 0 804 p 0 01 compared with the ecv rec sm the averaged r for the fused sm was improved by about 6 additionally the r of the fused sm was higher than that of ecv rec sm for all grids table 3 indicating that the fused sm had a stable higher consistency with the in situ measurements than the ecv rec sm the dynamic range of ubrmse for fused sm was between 0 043 and 0 095 cm3 cm 3 which was slightly improved compared to the ecv rec sm which ranged from 0 046 to 0 097 cm3 cm 3 the averaged ubrmse of the fused sm is slightly lower than that of the ecv rec sm and much lower than that of fy rec sm meanwhile r was improved and ubrmse was reduced in all grids to explore more detail information the improvements in r and ubrmse from ecv rec sm to fused sm at 1 year scale in all grids for naqu network were calculated the improvements in r ranged from 0 002 to 0 19 or from 0 02 to 39 and improvements in ubrmse ranged from 0 0002 to 0 009 cm3 cm 3 or from 0 4 to 17 the student s t test was also adopted to test whether these improvements were significant and results showed that r were significantly improved p 0 05 however the improvements in ubrmse were not significant for its distribution was far away from the normal distribution which is necessary to student s t test from 1 year to 3 year scale all indicators indicated that the fused sm inherited the advantages of fy rec sm in its variation capturing ability and of ecv rec sm in its accuracy for the maqu network with cold and humid climate the proposed two step fusion framework had a similar performance as for the naqu network with cold and semi arid climate tables 3 and 4 while the fused sm variation capturing ability was significantly improved by about 49 p 0 01 compared to the ecv rec sm the fused sm accuracy was also slightly improved it is noteworthy that the original ecv product had a worse performance in this climate region than in naqu both ecv rec sm and fused sm were close to the 1 1 line except for maqu and had various inconsistencies from grid to grid fig 8 in most cases the fused sm was closer to the 1 1 line than ecv rec sm especially for grid l22 and l43 improvements were found when the in situ sm is 0 2 cm3 cm 3 and there is less overestimation in the fused sm than in the ecv rec sm for all grids to show more information of variation the time series of ecv rec sm fy rec sm and fused sm were compared to the in situ observations over the dense grid from fig 9 it is clear that the fused sm performed better in capturing the temporal dynamics of in situ sm than other ecv rec sm where fy rec overestimated sm and ecv rec had strong uncertainty between july and september it seems that the fused sm inherited the advantages of stability during the period from october to the following june from fy rec sm and of having comparable absolute values between july and september from ecv rec sm some studies have pointed out that in situ measurements and few point measurements are only able to reproduce the temporal dynamics of sm but not the absolute values wagner et al 2013 obtaining a high r is also the objective of the ecv sm product hence the two step fusion framework proposed here is an endeavor to this object together with accuracy and temporal coverage were also improved 4 3 analysis of temporal coverage of sm over the tp the temporal coverage of ecv ori sm fy ori sm and fused sm are shown in fig 10 compared with the ecv ori sm temporal coverage of the fused product was improved from 30 84 to 78 12 for the entire tp in the remaining 21 88 no data area corresponds to regions that the soil was frozen it is worth noting that the temporal coverage was related to the classification of whether the soil was unfrozen or not in this study the soil was defined as unfrozen where lst was higher than 273 k and the albedo was lower than 0 3 based on prior research cui et al 2016 in the future a more accurate freeze thaw discrimination method could be considered such as a microwave observation based method rattanadecho 2004 the ecv ori sm had higher temporal coverage than fy ori sm over the entire tp as expected unfortunately the temporal coverage of ecv ori sm was still very low over the tp the main reasons for this was that 1 the fused soil moisture products were from satellite observations at night time and 2 the tc based merging algorithm of ecv sm needs three products a day otherwise the algorithm fails liu et al 2011 the ecv product has a long term record and is useful for studying inter annual variability however the lower temporal coverage and non uniform distribution samples present a huge challenge differences between the annual average ecv ori sm and the fused sm ranged from 0 08 cm3 cm 3 to 0 08 cm3 cm 3 compared with the high coverage of fused ecv sm the ecv ori sm significantly overestimated the sm over most parts of the tp fig 11 the sm product data gaps were the main reason for this overestimation especially during the non growing period all these differences caution us that high data consistency is an important basis for data analysis especially at long term scales hence the fused product could be much more reliable in terms of coverage for data analysis at both seasonal and inter annual scales 5 conclusions this study proposed a two step sm fusion framework combining a machine learning based reconstruction and a cdf matching based fusion method to enhance the quality of the original ecv sm dataset over the tp this method not only inherited the advantages of both methods but also eliminated their shortcomings the cdf matching based fusion method is limited by the representative error due to the expanded spatio temporal scales of implementation and the machine learning based reconstruction process provides the possibility to overcome this disadvantage by improving the temporal coverage the two step sm fusion framework was tested using ecv and fy products over the tp and results showed that the temporal coverage variation capturing ability and accuracy of the fused sm were improved greatly the framework described in this paper could be extended to other products like smap entekhabi et al 2010a the result sm product of high quality is expected to help further understand the role of sm in the water and energy cycles in this study the fusion of ecv and fy sm was only evaluated over the tp with limited in situ measurements future studies using the two step sm fusion framework under a wider range of environmental conditions are needed to evaluate whether this framework can provide more accurate sm and the utility of the sm fusion framework on other satellite based sm products could be further

5426,a similar physical simulation experiment is a kind of generalization and reduction of real objects by similarity principle which achieves the simulation of the actual situation in order to reveal the influencing factors and mechanisms of the groundwater flow process in the karst aquifer system in this paper the hydrological cycle process of the karst aquifer system is comprehensively considered and a conceptual model is established including hydrological factors such as rainfall recharge epikarst zone doline fissure conduit and spring also a three dimensional physical model of karst fissure conduit for experiments is designed and fabricated from the similarity with the groundwater channel structure based on the hydrological conceptual model moreover karst aquifer under different rainfall conditions and aquifer structures is designed to simulate the process of seepage and recession the experiments were divided into 24 groups three times for each group the experiment results show that 1 the rainfall intensity has a significant impact on the maximum peak flow confluence time and flow duration of the spring flow process 2 the epikarst zone has a vital influence on the confluence time flow duration and curve shape of the spring flow process and has little effect on the peak flow and 3 the aquifer structure is the main factor affecting the initial flow the slope of the recession curve and the recession coefficient of the spring recession process finally this study indicates that the concept model is reasonable the physical model for simulating the hydrological process can be applied to a wide range in karst aquifers taking into account more geological factors keywords karst aquifer similarity simulation influencing factors seepage process recession process 1 introduction globally exposed soluble rocks account for about 20 of the land area and about 20 25 of the world s water sources rely mainly on this type of groundwater andreo 2012 lamoreaux and lamoreaux 2006 in many karst areas around the world water resources are limited for one thing the heterogeneity and anisotropy of karst aquifers make the groundwater distribution extremely complex then also karst groundwater modelling needs simplification and specific hydraulic assumptions for another thing there are great differences in terms of geological structure and hydraulic properties between karst and non karst groundwater movement goldscheider et al 2008 ding et al 2017 therefore researching the laws of karst groundwater movement is necessary to effectively use karst water in karst areas a large amount of karst groundwater is gathered in the conduit through various fissures to expose the surface in the form of karst springs or underground river exits bailly comte et al 2010 saller et al 2013 these natural outcrop points often become the main source of water for residents to live however the topography of a karst area fluctuates greatly and the karst fissure conduit is developed which leads to the rapid recharge of groundwater after rainwater falls on the surface the precipitation is easy to infiltrate and supply underground and water flow is concentrated in discharge area however karst mountain area is often a serious water shortage area despite the abundant rainfall luo et al 2014 the both of uncertainty of karst aquifer medium and dynamic characteristics of karst groundwater greatly increase the difficulty of exploitation and utilization of karst groundwater prediction of karst leakage pollution and even risk assessment of karst collapse ding et al 2019 traditional hydrogeological methods such as pumping test tracer test and connection test have some limitations in the study of karst aquifer structure flow characteristics and solute transport law goldscheider and drew 2007 la vigna et al 2014 with the development of mathematics and computer most of the research focuses on the establishment of a mathematical models and numerical simulations white 2002 enemark et al 2019 by analyzing the hydrological process of a spring establishing the mathematical model and carrying out the numerical simulation are helpful to further understand and predict the hydrological process of the aquifer system neto et al 2016 xu et al 2018 however the establishment of mathematical models requires a generalization of complex hydrogeological conditions this process tends to idealize the complex geological conditions which has limitations in application especially in karst aquifer system then many numerical simulation software has developed rapidly such as fellow modflow kang and sridhar 2019 gardner et al 2018 although numerical simulation can depict more complex geological conditions the results of numerical simulation in the karst area are not ideal in the process of application due to the calculation method adopted by the software and the particularity of geological conditions more importantly the heterogeneity of aquifer structure and multi structure are the essential reason resulting in the process of numerical simulation cannot completely reflect the characteristics of a karst aquifer in recent years physical simulation has been further developed according to the similar principle an actual geological model is established which can help to reveal many complex natural phenomena and processes in order to simulate the groundwater flow field in bedrock fissures karay and hajnal 2015 drew the contour line in the fissure network system through laboratory model and compares it with the results of modflow cfpv2 numerical simulation morales et al 2010 study the influence of the geometry of the conduit detention zone on the shape and evolution of the penetration curve under different hydrological conditions furthermore field and leij 2012 found that the penetration curve of solute transport in multi channel and conduit flows connected with pools are multi peak curve of positive skewness in china xu et al 2003 proved whether cubic law hypercubic law and subcubic law can appear in seepage law of rough fracture zhang et al 2016 based on the laboratory model used the size of fissure opening as the criterion to distinguish fissures from conduits and investigated the effectiveness of cubic law in closing fissures much more attentions have been focused on physical simulation to study groundwater similarity experiment is a very important method to study the flow characteristics of complex karst aquifer medium among these experiments however there are relatively few simulation studies that comprehensively consider the hydrological cycle of karst groundwater various influencing factors of groundwater dynamic conditions complete characteristics of aquifer structure and reasonable spatial distribution of fissure conduit in recognition of these problems a conceptual model was constructed about typical mature karst aquifer which included much more hydrological cycle elements in this study such as rainfall recharge epikarst zone infiltration fissure conduit runoff and drainage of spring point fig 1 on the one hand the similarity principle of aquifer channel structure was mainly considered in the process of establishing the model the model reduced the spatial scale and shortened the simulation period according to the principle of karst groundwater infiltration recharge and the formation mechanism of fissure conduit a conceptual model of karst aquifer medium was established on the other hand through analyzing the characteristics of the recharge runoff discharge characteristics and spatial distribution of geometric structure of karst aquifer medium in the real world this study considered the formation law of karst fissure conduit from local to whole and designed the physical model of hydrological system of fissure conduit aquifer medium with controllable rainfall conditions various infiltration paths and controllable fissure conduit connectivity consequently the aims of the experiment were to simulate a series of rainfall runoff processes the movement law of karst groundwater was studied and the effects of rainfall intensity epikarst zone and aquifer structure on seepage and recession are analyzed and discussed in addition the experiments are useful for describing the behaviors of mature karst aquifers 2 materials and methods 2 1 model structure the components of the model include the rainfall system the infiltration system the fissure conduit system the drainage system and the monitoring system the upper infiltration system is the unsaturated zone and the lower fissure conduit system is the saturated zone where most of the saturated zone is rapidly drained by the fissure conduit systems 1 rainfall system it is used to simulate the process of natural rainfall supplying the surface karst zone in the karst area different rainfall intensity can be controlled by adjusting the flow of per unit time 2 infiltration system in the carbonate rock area due to the upper part of the karst aquifer is eroded by erosive rainwater for a long time the surface karst zone with high permeability is often developed on the one hand this layer can temporarily store part of groundwater on the other hand it will redistribute the supply of the lower saturated aquifer part of the surface karst zone water supplies the lower saturated zone through the aeration zone 3 fissure conduit system this part in this model is mainly used to simulate the flow passing through a group of parallel water conducting fissure zones and being cut by a large fissure and then converging into a large fissure finally discharging at the bottom of the large fissure the upper part of the fissures is an open linear narrow fissure which is mainly supplied by linear infiltration of the surface karst zone while the lower part is mainly centralized discharged which supplies the deep conduit the conduit is used to simulate the conduit system of centralized discharge after multi source confluence 4 drainage system in this study the centralized drainage after the conduit confluence is designed to simulate the centralized drainage of spring point in a karst aquifer 5 monitoring system the hydraulic head can be observed by reading the scale and the flow measurement can be conducted by volume method and weighing method 2 2 materials before building the model it is necessary to determine the material content of the three dimensional solid model and select the appropriate material according to the geometry shape and stress of each part covington et al 2009 grasso and jeannin 2002 transparent pvc boards are used to construct epikarst box and fissures transparent acrylic tubes are used for doline installation and conduit network and pvc pipes with toughness and stress are selected for water filling circuit of rainfall simulator the main components of the experiment model include rainfall simulation epikarst simulation fissure network simulation conduit network simulation and pressure head monitoring the complete three dimensional physical model of karst fissure conduit is fabricated fig 2 1 different rainfall intensities are controlled by the water supply flow at the entrance of the rainfall simulator the geometric size of the rectangular water filling pipe is 78 cm 68 cm the diameter of the water filling pipe is 14 mm the diameter of the rainfall pipe is 5 mm and the diameter of the rainfall hole is 1 2 mm fig 3 the equation for calculating water supply flow and rainfall intensity of rainfall simulator in this experiment are as follows 1 i 360 q a where i is the rainfall intensity mm h q is the water supply flow rate ml s a is the area of the epikarst box receiving rainfall supply cm2 2 the size of the epikarst zone box is 78 cm 68 cm 65 cm the circular hole with diameter of 2 5 cm is the pipe hole of the doline and the circular hole with diameter of 2 cm is the connection hole of the bottom conduit there are 4 fissure which are all 50 cm and the width is 2 mm for the filling of the surface karst zone the rock blocks with the size of 10 cm 10 cm 3 33 cm are used to simulate the fissure network of the epikarst zone by orthogonal combination of three blocks fig 4 two layers of block stones are piled up from bottom to top in the epikarst box the top of the block stones is filled with 60 mesh quartz sand to form an undulating topographic surface the plastic film with weak permeability is laid in the confluence area of the doline so that part of the rainwater falling on its surface can be collected into the recharge conduit of the doline and part of it can be recharged through infiltration into the epikarst zone 3 the fissure runoff zone consists of three fissures with a gap width of 1 mm its geometric sizes are 50 cm 55 cm 50 cm 45 cm and 50 cm 35 cm respectively the gap width of large fissure is 2 mm and the geometric size is 50 cm 65 cm the drainage hole diameter at the bottom of the large fissure is 25 mm in this experiment water valves are installed in every fissure and conduit outlet whether anywhere can make water flow through it can be controlled by the opening and closing state of water valve fig 5 the water valve at the outlet of the pipe can be adjusted to control whether the pipe is overflowing or not there are three pipes d for the recharge of the doline namely d0 d1 and d2 two pipes c connected at the bottom of the epikarst box c1 and c2 and four fissures are composed of combined fissures f namely f1 f2 f3 and f4 after the model is completed its connectivity and leakproofness need to be tested the test method is to close the water valve at the discharge outlet and connect the pipe at the intake of the rainfall simulator to make the water flow through the rainfall simulator smoothly the uniformity of raindrops in the rainfall simulator can be observed if the rainfall is not uniform the level of the rainfall pipe can be adjusted to improve it at the same time experimenters should observe whether the epikarst box fissure joints and conduit joints are seepage if there is a leakage problem experimenters can mark the leakage point with a label then close the intake valve stop the water supply wait for the instrument to dry and repair the leakage one by one after the glue is dried continue to test test and repair repeatedly until the whole device do not leak when the leakproofness and connectivity of the device are good enough the aquifer medium in the epikarst zone can be filled in the box different hydrological scenarios can be adjusted by controlling the flow rate at the intake end of the rainfall simulator and different experimental schemes can be set up to simulate the water flow in the karst aquifer medium 2 3 experiment process 2 3 1 experiment for seepage process of karst spring flow by controlling the different water supply intensity and keeping stable the rainfall infiltrates into the epikarst zone and the water flows through the device eventually discharging centrally in the form of spring the flow rate at the outlet of the conduit and the head of each pressure measuring pipe in the seepage path are monitored according to the monitoring results the seepage law in karst aquifer medium is analyzed the experiment process is as follows 1 install the submersible pump in the water supply box and adjust the water supply intensity control the water valve at the point where the output terminal of submersible pump is connected with the rainfall simulator and set the water supply flow of the rainfall simulator to q1 q2 and q3 respectively 2 open the water transport channels and simulate the seepage process of the fissure conduit under the conditions of q1 q2 and q3 respectively 3 open the pump to start the water supply and click the stopwatch to start the timing 4 observe the outlet of the fissure conduit device click on the stopwatch to record the confluence time of the process when there is water flow and begin to monitor the flow change 5 after 10 min of water supply close the pump and stop the water supply 6 change the opening and closing state of the water valve replace the water flow transfer channel and repeat the above experiment procedure the water transport channels designed in this experiment are f c d f c f c and d 7 repeat the above experiment procedure after filling the epikarst zone a total of 24 groups of water flow seepage process simulations were carried out in this experiment after filling the epikarst zone the water transport channels are respectively set as f c d f c f c and d 2 3 2 experiment for recession process of karst spring flow different channels are set up to control the steady flow at the outlet and simulate the recession process separately the experimental steps are as follows 1 open the water valves in all channels to simulate the recession process in the f c 2 open the pump to supply water to the rainfall simulator 3 observe the flow state at the outlet when the flow increases to an unchanged level measuring the flow value if the results of three consecutive monitoring are close the next experiment can be carried out 4 when the outlet flow is stable close the pump stop the water supply and begin to simulate the recession process 5 monitor the process of flow change with time at the outlet and stop monitoring when the flow at the outlet decreases to a constant value 6 close all conduit valves and repeat the above steps to simulate the recession process in the fissures 7 close the water valve at the outlet of the fissure and repeat step 2 to 5 and simulate the recession process in the conduits 3 results the hydrodynamic simulation experiment in this study carried out the simulation of the seepage process and the recession process in different aquifer structures 3 1 seepage process the flow mechanism of karst springs closely related to climatic conditions however it is more controlled by aquifer structure and karst development at the same time fiorillo 2009 under the condition of whether or not the epikarst zone is filled the seepage process is simulated by setting different aquifer channels and different water supply intensity figs 6 and 7 show the flow process curve of discharge spring at the outlet except for the doline without epikarst filling the curve in other aquifer channels shows three stages in the course of the experiment it was found that the confluence surface could not be formed at the conduit of the doline when there was no epikarst zone filled and there was no water in the conduit even under the conditions of f c d and f c the simulation results were the same therefore the results did not repeatedly show the f c d in the seepage process experiment of the unfilled epikarst zone the water supply time of the seepage process of the doline was longer when the epikarst zone was not filled the rainfall directly fell to the bottom of the box and the water collected on the slope surface was not received in the doline meanwhile the outlet will not respond immediately to the rainfall subsequently when the water level in the box rose to a certain height the water flow can penetrate through the pipe of the doline therefore it needs to take a certain time for the water level to rise in the box in this experiment the confluence time was taken from the time interval between the epikarst box receiving rainfall recharge and the flow occurring at the outlet and the peak value of flow was taken as the average value of flow in the stable fluctuation stage the flow process can be divided into three stages the first stage is the rapid increase of flow in this stage the whole process of flow from appearance to maximum flow took a short time and the slope of the flow growth curve was very steep in the process of monitoring the water flow appears at the beginning which was observed as the form of water droplets and turned into a linear flow after a while a large number of bubbles with the water discharge and water flow quickly reached the maximum value when there was no epikarst zone filling the curve shape of this stage was almost a straight line otherwise with filling the epikarst zone the curve shape of this stage showed a trend of downward steep and upward gentle which was slower than that of the no epikarst zone the second stage is the stable fluctuation of flow in this stage the flow value was stable which moved up and down slightly with a constant value before the water supply stopped in the experiments the mean steady fluctuating flow at the outlet of each aquifer structure is shown in tables 1 and 2 due to some water was retained in the aquifer medium and the upper epikarst zone the maximum flow at the outlet after stabilization will also lose a part compared with the water supply flow initially the third stage is the recession of flow after a period of water supply the pump was closed and the water supply was stopped at the same time the flow at the outlet decreases rapidly in the experiment of filling without epikarst zone the outlet will be cut off when the water in the fissures and conduits was drained away there was no tailing of the curve at this stage after filling the epikarst zone the flow rate also decreased rapidly from the closing of the pump when the flow decreased to a certain value the flow rate decreased slowly nevertheless it was no rapid cut off and the curve was tailing at the end accordingly this stage can be divided into two sub stages fast recession and slow recession when the aquifer structure was doline with no epikarst filled the spring discharge process at the outlet will lag far behind the water flow process of the three aquifer structures f c f and c with the rise of the water level in the box the conduit can only receive the infiltration water from the doline for recharging therefore its confluence time and peak value lag behind other aquifer structure hundreds of times this result also explains why the experimental results of f c d and f c are similar in the condition of no epikarst zone owning to the confluence time of the doline is very long the confluence surface cannot be formed in a short time simultaneously the results are closely related to the intensity of the water supply tables 1 and 2 in particular when the intensity of water supply decreases the time to reach the peak value and the confluence also prolongs correspondingly 3 2 recession process tang et al 2016 used orthogonal fissure network and a conduit domain to simulate and analyze the recession curve of spring discharge of karst aquifer the experimental results showed that the diameter of the conduit and saturated thickness of the karst aquifer have different effects on the recession curve therefore based on the characteristics of the groundwater multi aquifer structure designed and manufactured by the research the recession schemes under the three scenarios of fissure conduit fissure and conduit are planned in this study in the recession process the recession curves of the three aquifer structures are similar and can be divided into two stages fig 8 the first stage is the fast flow stage which not only lasted a short time and had a curve of the steep slope but also the flow recession was rapid the second stage is the slow flow stage which is different from the first stage in this stage the recession curves showed as an asymptotic line in the abscissa coordinate which lasted a long time for one thing the flow recession was slow and the tail was long for another thing the base flow was very small relative to the initial flow the experimental results show that these three aquifer structures have very strong discharge capacity table 3 the discharge is mainly concentrated in conduits and fissures and only a small amount of water is stored in the epikarst zone with the change of aquifer structure both the initial flow of recession showed a decreasing trend therefore the outlet discharge is positively correlated with the degree of karst development 4 discussion normally there are three main methods used in groundwater research to describe hydrological behavior including mathematical model numerical simulation and similar experiment kumar 2014 chen 1995 shu et al 2015 in recent years the use of mathematical models and numerical simulation to verify the results has attracted wide attention chang et al 2015 initially similar experiments were a common method widely used however limited by the use of materials too complex experiments cannot be achieved with the development of technology similar experiments have made greater progress and have been used to simulate complex geological conditions the hydrological cycle process in karst areas is so complicated that only consider a single factor cannot to explain this phenomenon how to comprehensively take into account the movement law of karst groundwater under the combined action of rainfall recharge concentrated infiltration of doline and dispersed infiltration of epikarst zone runoff discharge of deep fissure zone and conduit network is an essential issue to sum up the aims of the experiment is to study the movement law of karst groundwater and analysis the effects of rainfall intensity epikarst zone and aquifer structure on seepage and recession process 4 1 the role of influencing factors the flow movement in the karst aquifer is affected by many factors in order to research the movement law of karst groundwater it is very important to study the effects of various factors karay and hajnal 2015 morales et al 2010 field and leij 2012 however the structure of karst aquifer is very complex taking all factors into account is difficult especially using similar simulation experiments xu et al 2003 zhang et al 2016 in this paper we build a similar physical model based on the concept model of a karst aquifer and try to analysis the influence of rainfall intensity epikarst zone and aquifer structure on the movement of karst groundwater 4 1 1 influencing of rainfall intensity on the process of outlet flow the results show that the shorter the rainfall intensity is the longer the confluence duration is under the same recharge time the smaller the rainfall intensity is the smaller the peak flow can be achieved in each aquifer structure when rainfall intensity is 4 6744 mm h the duration of flow reaching the outlet is 269 2 s when rainfall intensity is 3 4690 mm h the duration of flow reaching the outlet is 354 5 s when rainfall intensity is 2 4876 mm h the duration of flow reaching the outlet is 534 04 s fig 9 in this scenario the confluence duration increases significantly with the decrease in rainfall intensity in addition after filling the epikarst zone the confluence duration in fissure conduit f c and conduit c increases significantly with the decrease of rainfall intensity rainfall intensity affects not only the duration of confluence but also the peak flow the peak flow at the outlet decreases significantly with the decrease of rainfall intensity regardless of the filling of the epikarst zone the peak flow rate in fissure conduit f c fissure f conduit c and doline d decreases stepwise with the decrease of rainfall intensity fig 10 the smaller the rainfall intensity is the more the flow curve deviates from the ordinate axis and the longer the peak time is figs 6 and 7 4 1 2 influence of epikarst zone on the process of outlet flow from the experimental results whether the surface karst zone is filled or not mainly affects the confluence duration peak flow time and the shape of the flow process curve except for the doline the confluence duration without filling in the epikarst zone box is shorter than that with filling in the epikarst zone box and the peak flow occurs earlier figs 6 and 7 due to the epikarst zone has the function of redistribution and storage for rainfall the transfer of the flow process curve from the first stage to the second stage is quick before filling there was no tailing in the third stage after filling the epikarst zone the flow curve increases slowly in the first stage and there is a slow change from the first stage to the second stage in the third stage the flow declines slowly as well for the doline after filling the epikarst zone the undulating terrain has a confluence effect on rainfall the confluence time therefore is much shorter than that without filling and the peak flow is relatively large 4 1 3 influence of aquifer structure on the process of outlet flow different aquifer structures have a certain influence on the discharge process of outlet springs when there is no epikarst zone filling the order of confluence duration is fissure fissure conduit conduit doline the peak flow of fissure conduit fissure and conduit are the same and the shape of the flow process curve is the same too however the doline is different which the peak flow is small and the curve shape has no stable fluctuation stage after filling the epikarst zone the confluence time is arranged in the order of doline fissure fissure conduit conduit the peak flow in each aquifer structure is the same there are three stages in the flow process curve but the stable fluctuation stage of doline is relatively short and the curve of the first stage has an inflection point 4 2 the analysis of recession curve the understanding of the process of water recession is also one of the important contents in the study of water balance and hydrological response there are two main methods to analyze the recession curve civita 2008 li et al 2016 fiorillo 2014 dewandel et al 2003 one is to use mathematical function to fit the complete recession curve but it has no connection with the groundwater flow equation moreover the physical significance of fitting empirical parameters needs to be further explored the other is diffusion equation method based on approximate and exact analytical solutions 4 2 1 fitting equation in order to explore and predict the law of recession in aquifer medium the experimental results of recession process in different aquifer structures are non linearly fitted based on the measured data levenberg marquardt method in 1stopt software and general global optimization method are selected to fit the non linearly fig 11 the recession process of the three aquifer structures conforms to the fractional polynomial eq 2 2 q t p 1 p 3 t 0 5 p 5 t 1 p 2 t 0 5 p 4 t p 6 t 1 5 where q t is the flow value at any time during the recession process ml s t is time s p 1 p 2 p 3 p 4 p 5 p 6 is the fitting parameter the fitting results show that the goodness of fit of the fractional polynomial is above 0 9999 the residual histogram shows that the measured value is very close to the calculated value from 1stopt software the maximum residual value in the three groups of experiments is less than 0 15 and the fitting accuracy is very high 4 2 2 diffusion equation a diffusion equation was used to describe water flow in porous media by boussinesq boussinesq 1877 eq 3 3 h t k φ x h h x where k is the hydraulic conductivity darcy permeability coefficient m s φ is the effective porosity of the aquifer free water storage coefficient of the aquifer dimensionless h is the hydraulic head m t is the time s by simplifying the hypothesis and integrating eq 3 boussinesq found an approximate analytical solution of the diffusion equation amit et al 2002 4 q t q 0 e α t 5 q 0 π 2 k h l h m l 6 α π 2 k h 4 φ l 2 where q 0 is the initial flow rate m3 s qt is the flow rate at any time m3 s α is the recession coefficient s 1 l is the width of the aquifer m h is the thickness of the aquifer below the outlet level m h m is the initial head of the aquifer width l m l is the length of the constant stream m eq 4 can be regarded as an exponential equation decaying with time subsequently boussinesq further improved the assumptions and obtained an exact analytical solution of the diffusion equation called quadratic equation dewandel et al 2003 7 q t q 0 1 α t 2 8 q 0 0 862 k l h m 2 l 9 α 1 115 k h m φ l 2 in the process of spring recession without recharge the recession coefficient is an important physical quantity reflecting the type of aquifer in the water releasing medium according to the measured data of the experiment process this paper used the eqs 4 and 7 to quantitatively analyzed the recession process of the flow rate in the karst spring and evaluated the parameter values in the equation by nonlinear fitting the best estimate of the initial flow and recession coefficients is shown in table 4 in different aquifer structures the recession coefficients fitted by exponential recession equation and quadratic equation have the same trend first the recession coefficient of spring discharge in conduit structure is the largest and the recession rate is faster second the recession coefficient of spring discharge in fissure structure is the smallest and the recession rate is slower when there are fissure and conduit structure the recession coefficient of spring discharge is between the fissure and conduit furthermore the recession rate in the conduit is faster than that in the fissure compared with the measured value the exponential recession equation overestimates the initial flow q 0 with a maximum relative error of 15 98 while the quadratic estimation results are close to the measured value with a maximum relative error of less than 1 5 therefore the quadratic equation can better evaluate the relationship between flow and time in the process of karst aquifer recession the results show that the aquifer structure influences the recession process of spring discharge at the outlet 5 conclusion a typical conceptual model of aquifer medium is constructed according to the characteristics of recharge runoff and discharge of hydrological system in karst areas on the basis of the conceptual model a three dimensional solid model is designed and a physical model is made regarding it through the analysis of the experimental results the following conclusions are deduced based on the present study 1 the flow process at the outlet of karst spring is modulated by rainfall intensity epikarst zone and aquifer structure the flow process curve can be divided into three stages rapid increase stage steady fluctuation stage and recession stage then the rainfall intensity has an obvious influence on the maximum peak flow confluence time and flow duration 2 the epikarst zone has not only secondary distribution effect on rainfall process but also regulation and storage effect on the runoff process the regulation and storage effect of epikarst zone will prolong the time of peak flow and delay the duration of runoff process especially without epikast zone filled the influence is manifest on the condition of f c d and f c in general the epikarst zone has a significant impact on the concentration time flow duration and curve shape of the spring flow process but has little impact on the peak flow 3 different aquifer structures will influence the seepage process the effects of fissures conduits fissures and conduits on the flow process are manifest in the shape of flow process curve confluence time peak flow time and confluence duration meantime the aquifer structure is the main factor that affects the initial flow of recession process the slope of the recession curve and the coefficient of the recession 4 the nonlinear mathematical fitting of a fractional polynomial in the recession process has high reliability but the physical meaning of fitting parameters needs to be further explored the initial discharge of quadratic fitting of traditional recession equation is closer to the measured data than that of exponential recession function 5 karst aquifer system is very complex in this paper although many factors have been taken into account there are still some shortcoming for example the water of temperature and chemistry in the process of simulation both the hydraulic head and the flow are manually read and the test needs many people to cooperate with the operation the disadvantage of manual monitoring is time consuming and there are different manual errors when different people observe however the proposed model can reflect the characteristics of karst aquifers under certain conditions and also reflects the influence of different geological conditions on the hydrological process this study using similarity experiment to explore the flow characteristics of karst aquifer medium by designing different rainfall conditions to simulate the seepage process and recession process of different aquifer structure in conclusion the establishment of the model is relatively reasonable and effective and the results of the experiment have great reference value and significance for further research credit authorship

5426,a similar physical simulation experiment is a kind of generalization and reduction of real objects by similarity principle which achieves the simulation of the actual situation in order to reveal the influencing factors and mechanisms of the groundwater flow process in the karst aquifer system in this paper the hydrological cycle process of the karst aquifer system is comprehensively considered and a conceptual model is established including hydrological factors such as rainfall recharge epikarst zone doline fissure conduit and spring also a three dimensional physical model of karst fissure conduit for experiments is designed and fabricated from the similarity with the groundwater channel structure based on the hydrological conceptual model moreover karst aquifer under different rainfall conditions and aquifer structures is designed to simulate the process of seepage and recession the experiments were divided into 24 groups three times for each group the experiment results show that 1 the rainfall intensity has a significant impact on the maximum peak flow confluence time and flow duration of the spring flow process 2 the epikarst zone has a vital influence on the confluence time flow duration and curve shape of the spring flow process and has little effect on the peak flow and 3 the aquifer structure is the main factor affecting the initial flow the slope of the recession curve and the recession coefficient of the spring recession process finally this study indicates that the concept model is reasonable the physical model for simulating the hydrological process can be applied to a wide range in karst aquifers taking into account more geological factors keywords karst aquifer similarity simulation influencing factors seepage process recession process 1 introduction globally exposed soluble rocks account for about 20 of the land area and about 20 25 of the world s water sources rely mainly on this type of groundwater andreo 2012 lamoreaux and lamoreaux 2006 in many karst areas around the world water resources are limited for one thing the heterogeneity and anisotropy of karst aquifers make the groundwater distribution extremely complex then also karst groundwater modelling needs simplification and specific hydraulic assumptions for another thing there are great differences in terms of geological structure and hydraulic properties between karst and non karst groundwater movement goldscheider et al 2008 ding et al 2017 therefore researching the laws of karst groundwater movement is necessary to effectively use karst water in karst areas a large amount of karst groundwater is gathered in the conduit through various fissures to expose the surface in the form of karst springs or underground river exits bailly comte et al 2010 saller et al 2013 these natural outcrop points often become the main source of water for residents to live however the topography of a karst area fluctuates greatly and the karst fissure conduit is developed which leads to the rapid recharge of groundwater after rainwater falls on the surface the precipitation is easy to infiltrate and supply underground and water flow is concentrated in discharge area however karst mountain area is often a serious water shortage area despite the abundant rainfall luo et al 2014 the both of uncertainty of karst aquifer medium and dynamic characteristics of karst groundwater greatly increase the difficulty of exploitation and utilization of karst groundwater prediction of karst leakage pollution and even risk assessment of karst collapse ding et al 2019 traditional hydrogeological methods such as pumping test tracer test and connection test have some limitations in the study of karst aquifer structure flow characteristics and solute transport law goldscheider and drew 2007 la vigna et al 2014 with the development of mathematics and computer most of the research focuses on the establishment of a mathematical models and numerical simulations white 2002 enemark et al 2019 by analyzing the hydrological process of a spring establishing the mathematical model and carrying out the numerical simulation are helpful to further understand and predict the hydrological process of the aquifer system neto et al 2016 xu et al 2018 however the establishment of mathematical models requires a generalization of complex hydrogeological conditions this process tends to idealize the complex geological conditions which has limitations in application especially in karst aquifer system then many numerical simulation software has developed rapidly such as fellow modflow kang and sridhar 2019 gardner et al 2018 although numerical simulation can depict more complex geological conditions the results of numerical simulation in the karst area are not ideal in the process of application due to the calculation method adopted by the software and the particularity of geological conditions more importantly the heterogeneity of aquifer structure and multi structure are the essential reason resulting in the process of numerical simulation cannot completely reflect the characteristics of a karst aquifer in recent years physical simulation has been further developed according to the similar principle an actual geological model is established which can help to reveal many complex natural phenomena and processes in order to simulate the groundwater flow field in bedrock fissures karay and hajnal 2015 drew the contour line in the fissure network system through laboratory model and compares it with the results of modflow cfpv2 numerical simulation morales et al 2010 study the influence of the geometry of the conduit detention zone on the shape and evolution of the penetration curve under different hydrological conditions furthermore field and leij 2012 found that the penetration curve of solute transport in multi channel and conduit flows connected with pools are multi peak curve of positive skewness in china xu et al 2003 proved whether cubic law hypercubic law and subcubic law can appear in seepage law of rough fracture zhang et al 2016 based on the laboratory model used the size of fissure opening as the criterion to distinguish fissures from conduits and investigated the effectiveness of cubic law in closing fissures much more attentions have been focused on physical simulation to study groundwater similarity experiment is a very important method to study the flow characteristics of complex karst aquifer medium among these experiments however there are relatively few simulation studies that comprehensively consider the hydrological cycle of karst groundwater various influencing factors of groundwater dynamic conditions complete characteristics of aquifer structure and reasonable spatial distribution of fissure conduit in recognition of these problems a conceptual model was constructed about typical mature karst aquifer which included much more hydrological cycle elements in this study such as rainfall recharge epikarst zone infiltration fissure conduit runoff and drainage of spring point fig 1 on the one hand the similarity principle of aquifer channel structure was mainly considered in the process of establishing the model the model reduced the spatial scale and shortened the simulation period according to the principle of karst groundwater infiltration recharge and the formation mechanism of fissure conduit a conceptual model of karst aquifer medium was established on the other hand through analyzing the characteristics of the recharge runoff discharge characteristics and spatial distribution of geometric structure of karst aquifer medium in the real world this study considered the formation law of karst fissure conduit from local to whole and designed the physical model of hydrological system of fissure conduit aquifer medium with controllable rainfall conditions various infiltration paths and controllable fissure conduit connectivity consequently the aims of the experiment were to simulate a series of rainfall runoff processes the movement law of karst groundwater was studied and the effects of rainfall intensity epikarst zone and aquifer structure on seepage and recession are analyzed and discussed in addition the experiments are useful for describing the behaviors of mature karst aquifers 2 materials and methods 2 1 model structure the components of the model include the rainfall system the infiltration system the fissure conduit system the drainage system and the monitoring system the upper infiltration system is the unsaturated zone and the lower fissure conduit system is the saturated zone where most of the saturated zone is rapidly drained by the fissure conduit systems 1 rainfall system it is used to simulate the process of natural rainfall supplying the surface karst zone in the karst area different rainfall intensity can be controlled by adjusting the flow of per unit time 2 infiltration system in the carbonate rock area due to the upper part of the karst aquifer is eroded by erosive rainwater for a long time the surface karst zone with high permeability is often developed on the one hand this layer can temporarily store part of groundwater on the other hand it will redistribute the supply of the lower saturated aquifer part of the surface karst zone water supplies the lower saturated zone through the aeration zone 3 fissure conduit system this part in this model is mainly used to simulate the flow passing through a group of parallel water conducting fissure zones and being cut by a large fissure and then converging into a large fissure finally discharging at the bottom of the large fissure the upper part of the fissures is an open linear narrow fissure which is mainly supplied by linear infiltration of the surface karst zone while the lower part is mainly centralized discharged which supplies the deep conduit the conduit is used to simulate the conduit system of centralized discharge after multi source confluence 4 drainage system in this study the centralized drainage after the conduit confluence is designed to simulate the centralized drainage of spring point in a karst aquifer 5 monitoring system the hydraulic head can be observed by reading the scale and the flow measurement can be conducted by volume method and weighing method 2 2 materials before building the model it is necessary to determine the material content of the three dimensional solid model and select the appropriate material according to the geometry shape and stress of each part covington et al 2009 grasso and jeannin 2002 transparent pvc boards are used to construct epikarst box and fissures transparent acrylic tubes are used for doline installation and conduit network and pvc pipes with toughness and stress are selected for water filling circuit of rainfall simulator the main components of the experiment model include rainfall simulation epikarst simulation fissure network simulation conduit network simulation and pressure head monitoring the complete three dimensional physical model of karst fissure conduit is fabricated

diameter of the water filling pipe is 14 mm the diameter of the rainfall pipe is 5 mm and the diameter of the rainfall hole is 1 2 mm fig 3 the equation for calculating water supply flow and rainfall

connection hole of the bottom conduit there are 4 fissure which are all 50 cm and the width is 2 mm for the filling of the surface karst zone the rock blocks with the size of 10 cm 10 cm 3 33 cm are used to simulate the fissure network of the epikarst zone by orthogonal combination of three blocks fig 4 two layers of block stones are piled up from bottom to top in the epikarst box the top of the block stones is filled with 60 mesh quartz sand to form an undulating topographic surface the plastic film with weak permeability is laid in the confluence area of the doline so that part of the rainwater falling on its surface can be collected into the recharge conduit of the doline and part of it can be recharged through infiltration into the epikarst zone 3 the fissure runoff zone consists of three fissures with a gap width of 1 mm its geometric sizes are 50 cm 55 cm 50 cm 45 cm and 50 cm 35 cm respectively the gap width of large fissure is 2 mm and the geometric size is 50 cm 65 cm the drainage hole diameter at the bottom of the large fissure is 25 mm in this experiment water valves are installed in every fissure and conduit outlet whether anywhere can make water flow through it can be controlled by the opening and closing state of water valve fig 5 the water valve at the outlet of the pipe can be adjusted to control whether the pipe is overflowing or not there are three pipes d for the recharge of the doline namely d0 d1 and d2 two pipes c connected at the bottom of the epikarst box c1 and c2 and four fissures are composed of combined fissures f namely f1 f2 f3 and f4 after the model is completed its connectivity and leakproofness need to be tested the test method is to close the water valve at the discharge outlet and connect the pipe at the intake of the rainfall simulator to make the water flow through the rainfall simulator smoothly the uniformity of raindrops in the rainfall simulator can be observed if the rainfall is not uniform the level of the rainfall pipe can be adjusted to improve it at the same time experimenters should observe whether the epikarst box fissure joints and conduit joints are seepage if there is a leakage problem experimenters can mark the leakage point with a label then close the intake valve stop the water supply wait for the instrument to dry and repair the leakage one by one after the glue is dried continue to test test and repair repeatedly until the whole device do not leak when the leakproofness and connectivity of the device are good enough the aquifer medium in the epikarst zone can be filled in the box different hydrological scenarios can be adjusted by controlling the flow rate at the intake end of the rainfall simulator and different experimental schemes can be set up to simulate the water flow in the karst aquifer medium 2 3 experiment process 2 3 1 experiment for seepage process of karst spring flow by controlling the different water supply intensity and keeping stable the rainfall infiltrates into the epikarst zone and the water flows through the device eventually discharging centrally in the form of spring the flow rate at the outlet of the conduit and the head of each pressure measuring pipe in the seepage path are monitored according to the monitoring results the seepage law in karst aquifer medium is analyzed the experiment process is as follows 1 install the submersible pump in the water supply box and adjust the water supply intensity control the water valve at the point where the output terminal of submersible pump is connected with the rainfall simulator and set the water supply flow of the rainfall simulator to q1 q2 and q3 respectively 2 open the water transport channels and simulate the seepage process of the fissure conduit under the conditions of q1 q2 and q3 respectively 3 open the pump to start the water supply and click the stopwatch to start the timing 4 observe the outlet of the fissure conduit device click on the stopwatch to record the confluence time of the process when there is water flow and begin to monitor the flow change 5 after 10 min of water supply close the pump and stop the water supply 6 change the opening and closing state of the water valve replace the water flow transfer channel and repeat the above experiment procedure the water transport channels designed in this experiment are f c d f c f c and d 7 repeat the above experiment procedure after filling the epikarst zone a total of 24 groups of water flow seepage process simulations were carried out in this experiment after filling the epikarst zone the water transport channels are respectively set as f c d f c f c and d 2 3 2 experiment for recession process of karst spring flow different channels are set up to control the steady flow at the outlet and simulate the recession process separately the experimental steps are as follows 1 open the water valves in all channels to simulate the recession process in the f c 2 open the pump to supply water to the rainfall simulator 3 observe the flow state at the outlet when the flow increases to an unchanged level measuring the flow value if the results of three consecutive monitoring are close the next experiment can be carried out 4 when the outlet flow is stable close the pump stop the water supply and begin to simulate the recession process 5 monitor the process of flow change with time at the outlet and stop monitoring when the flow at the outlet decreases to a constant value 6 close all conduit valves and repeat the above steps to simulate the recession process in the fissures 7 close the water valve at the outlet of the fissure and repeat step 2 to 5 and simulate the recession process in the conduits 3 results the hydrodynamic simulation experiment in this study carried out the simulation of the seepage process and the recession process in different aquifer structures 3 1 seepage process the flow mechanism of karst springs closely related to climatic conditions however it is more controlled by aquifer structure and karst development at the same time fiorillo 2009 under the condition of whether or not the epikarst zone is filled the seepage process is simulated by setting different aquifer channels and different water supply intensity figs 6 and 7 show the flow process curve of discharge spring at the outlet except for the doline without epikarst filling the curve in other aquifer channels shows three stages in the course of the experiment it was found that the confluence surface could not be formed at the conduit of the doline when there was no epikarst zone filled and there was no water in the conduit even under the conditions of f c d and f c the simulation results were the same therefore the results did not repeatedly show the f c d in the seepage process experiment of the unfilled epikarst zone the water supply time of the seepage process of the doline was longer when the epikarst zone was not filled the rainfall directly fell to the bottom of the box and the water collected on the slope surface was not received in the doline meanwhile the outlet will not respond immediately to the rainfall subsequently when the water level in the box rose to a certain height the water flow can penetrate through the pipe of the doline therefore it needs to take a certain time for the water level to rise in the box in this experiment the confluence time was taken from the time interval between the epikarst box receiving rainfall recharge and the flow occurring at the outlet and the peak value of flow was taken as the average value of flow in the stable fluctuation stage the flow process can be divided into three stages the first stage is the rapid increase of flow in this stage the whole process of flow from appearance to maximum flow took a short time and the slope of the flow growth curve was very steep in the process of monitoring the water flow appears at the beginning which was observed as the form of water droplets and turned into a linear flow after a while a large number of bubbles with the water discharge and water flow quickly reached the maximum value when there was no epikarst zone filling the curve shape of this stage was almost a straight line otherwise with filling the epikarst zone the curve shape of this stage showed a trend of downward steep and upward gentle which was slower than that of the no epikarst zone the second stage is the stable fluctuation of flow in this stage the flow value was stable which moved up and down slightly with a constant value before the water supply stopped in the experiments the mean steady fluctuating flow at the outlet of each aquifer structure is shown in tables 1 and 2 due to some water was retained in the aquifer medium and the upper epikarst zone the maximum flow at the outlet after stabilization will also lose a part compared with the water supply flow initially the third stage is the recession of flow after a period of water supply the pump was closed and the water supply was stopped at the same time the flow at the outlet decreases rapidly in the experiment of filling without epikarst zone the outlet will be cut off when the water in the fissures and conduits was drained away there was no tailing of the curve at this stage after filling the epikarst zone the flow rate also decreased rapidly from the closing of the pump when the flow decreased to a certain value the flow rate decreased slowly nevertheless it was no rapid cut off and the curve was tailing at the end accordingly this stage can be divided into two sub stages fast recession and slow recession when the aquifer structure was doline with no epikarst filled the spring discharge process at the outlet will lag far behind the water flow process of the three aquifer structures f c f and c with the rise of the water level in the box the conduit can only receive the infiltration water from the doline for recharging therefore its confluence time and peak value lag behind other aquifer structure hundreds of times this result also explains why the experimental results of f c d and f c are similar in the condition of no epikarst zone owning to the confluence time of the doline is very long the confluence surface cannot be formed in a short time simultaneously the results are closely related to the intensity of the water supply tables 1 and 2 in particular when the intensity of water supply decreases the time to reach the peak value and the confluence also prolongs correspondingly 3 2 recession process tang et al 2016 used orthogonal fissure network and a conduit domain to simulate and analyze the recession curve of spring discharge of karst aquifer the experimental results showed that the diameter of the conduit and saturated thickness of the karst aquifer have different effects on the recession curve therefore based on the characteristics of the groundwater multi aquifer structure designed and manufactured by the research the recession schemes under the three scenarios of fissure conduit fissure and conduit are planned in this study in the recession process the recession curves of the three aquifer structures are similar and can be divided into two stages fig 8 the first stage is the fast flow stage which not only lasted a short time and had a curve of the steep slope but also the flow recession was rapid the second stage is the slow flow stage which is different from the first stage in this stage the recession curves showed as an asymptotic line in the abscissa coordinate which lasted a long time for one thing the flow recession was slow and the tail was long for another thing the base flow was very small relative to the initial flow the experimental results show that these three aquifer structures have very strong discharge capacity table 3 the discharge is mainly concentrated in conduits and fissures and only a small amount of water is stored in the epikarst zone with the change of aquifer structure both the initial flow of recession showed a decreasing trend therefore the outlet discharge is positively correlated with the degree of karst development 4 discussion normally there are three main methods used in groundwater research to describe hydrological behavior including mathematical model numerical simulation and similar experiment kumar 2014 chen 1995 shu et al 2015 in recent years the use of mathematical models and numerical simulation to verify the results has attracted wide attention chang et al 2015 initially similar experiments were a common method widely used however limited by the use of materials too complex experiments cannot be achieved with the development of technology similar experiments have made greater progress and have been used to simulate complex geological conditions the hydrological cycle process in karst areas is so complicated that only consider a single factor cannot to explain this phenomenon how to comprehensively take into account the movement law of karst groundwater under the combined action of rainfall recharge concentrated infiltration of doline and dispersed infiltration of epikarst zone runoff discharge of deep fissure zone and conduit network is an essential issue to sum up the aims of the experiment is to study the movement law of karst groundwater and analysis the effects of rainfall intensity epikarst zone and aquifer structure on seepage and recession process 4 1 the role of influencing factors the flow movement in the karst aquifer is affected by many factors in order to research the movement law of karst groundwater it is very important to study the effects of various factors karay and hajnal 2015 morales et al 2010 field and leij 2012 however the structure of karst aquifer is very complex taking all factors into account is difficult especially using similar simulation experiments xu et al 2003 zhang et al 2016 in this paper we build a similar physical model based on the concept model of a karst aquifer and try to analysis the influence of rainfall intensity epikarst zone and aquifer structure on the movement of karst groundwater 4 1 1 influencing of rainfall intensity on the process of outlet flow the results show that the shorter the rainfall intensity is the longer the confluence duration is under the same recharge time the smaller the rainfall intensity is the smaller the peak flow can be achieved in each aquifer structure when rainfall intensity is 4 6744 mm h the duration of flow reaching the outlet is 269 2 s when rainfall intensity is 3 4690 mm h the duration of flow reaching the outlet is 354 5 s when rainfall intensity is 2 4876 mm h the duration of flow reaching the outlet is 534 04 s fig 9 in this scenario the confluence duration increases significantly with the decrease in rainfall intensity in addition after filling the epikarst zone the confluence duration in fissure conduit f c and conduit c increases significantly with the decrease of rainfall intensity rainfall intensity affects not only the duration of confluence but also the peak flow the peak flow at the outlet decreases significantly with the decrease of rainfall intensity regardless of the filling of the epikarst zone the peak flow rate in fissure conduit f c fissure f conduit c and doline d decreases stepwise with the decrease of rainfall intensity fig 10 the smaller the rainfall intensity is the more the flow curve deviates from the ordinate axis and the longer the peak time is figs 6 and 7 4 1 2 influence of epikarst zone on the process of outlet flow from the experimental results whether the surface karst zone is filled or not mainly affects the confluence duration peak flow time and the shape of the flow process curve except for the doline the confluence duration without filling in the epikarst zone box is shorter than that with filling in the epikarst zone box and the peak flow occurs earlier figs 6 and 7 due to the epikarst zone has the function of redistribution and storage for rainfall the transfer of the flow process curve from the first stage to the second stage is quick before filling there was no tailing in the third stage after filling the epikarst zone the flow curve increases slowly in the first stage and there is a slow change from the first stage to the second stage in the third stage the flow declines slowly as well for the doline after filling the epikarst zone the undulating terrain has a confluence effect on rainfall the confluence time therefore is much shorter than that without filling and the peak flow is relatively large 4 1 3 influence of aquifer structure on the process of outlet flow different aquifer structures have a certain influence on the discharge process of outlet springs when there is no epikarst zone filling the order of confluence duration is fissure fissure conduit conduit doline the peak flow of fissure conduit fissure and conduit are the same and the shape of the flow process curve is the same too however the doline is different which the peak flow is small and the curve shape has no stable fluctuation stage after filling the epikarst zone the confluence time is arranged in the order of doline fissure fissure conduit conduit the peak flow in each aquifer structure is the same there are three stages in the flow process curve but the stable fluctuation stage of doline is relatively short and the curve of the first stage has an inflection point 4 2 the analysis of recession curve the understanding of the process of water recession is also one of the important contents in the study of water balance and hydrological response there are two main methods to analyze the recession curve civita 2008 li et al 2016 fiorillo 2014 dewandel et al 2003 one is to use mathematical function to fit the complete recession curve but it has no connection with the groundwater flow equation moreover the physical significance of fitting empirical parameters needs to be further explored the other is diffusion equation method based on approximate and exact analytical solutions 4 2 1 fitting equation in order to explore and predict the law of recession in aquifer medium the experimental results of recession process in different aquifer structures are non linearly fitted based on the measured data levenberg marquardt method in 1stopt software and general global optimization method are selected to fit the non linearly fig 11 the recession process of the three aquifer structures conforms to the fractional polynomial eq 2 2 q t p 1 p 3 t 0 5 p 5 t 1 p 2 t 0 5 p 4 t p 6 t 1 5 where q t is the flow value at any time during the recession process ml s t is time s p 1 p 2 p 3 p 4 p 5 p 6 is the fitting parameter the fitting results show that the goodness of fit of the fractional polynomial is above 0 9999 the residual histogram shows that the measured value is very close to the calculated value from 1stopt software the maximum residual value in the three groups of experiments is less than 0 15 and the fitting accuracy is very high 4 2 2 diffusion equation a diffusion equation was used to describe water flow in porous media by boussinesq boussinesq 1877 eq 3 3 h t k φ x h h x where k is the hydraulic conductivity darcy permeability coefficient m s φ is the effective porosity of the aquifer free water storage coefficient of the aquifer dimensionless h is the hydraulic head m t is the time s by simplifying the hypothesis and integrating eq 3 boussinesq found an approximate analytical solution of the diffusion equation amit et al 2002 4 q t q 0 e α t 5 q 0 π 2 k h l h m l 6 α π 2 k h 4 φ l 2 where q 0 is the initial flow rate m3 s qt is the flow rate at any time m3 s α is the recession coefficient s 1 l is the width of the aquifer m h is the thickness of the aquifer below the outlet level m h m is the initial head of the aquifer width l m l is the length of the constant stream m eq 4 can be regarded as an exponential equation decaying with time subsequently boussinesq further improved the assumptions and obtained an exact analytical solution of the diffusion equation called quadratic equation dewandel et al 2003 7 q t q 0 1 α t 2 8 q 0 0 862 k l h m 2 l 9 α 1 115 k h m φ l 2 in the process of spring recession without recharge the recession coefficient is an important physical quantity reflecting the type of aquifer in the water releasing medium according to the measured data of the experiment process this paper used the eqs 4 and 7 to quantitatively analyzed the recession process of the flow rate in the karst spring and evaluated the parameter values in the equation by nonlinear fitting the best estimate of the initial flow and recession coefficients is shown in table 4 in different aquifer structures the recession coefficients fitted by exponential recession equation and quadratic equation have the same trend first the recession coefficient of spring discharge in conduit structure is the largest and the recession rate is faster second the recession coefficient of spring discharge in fissure structure is the smallest and the recession rate is slower when there are fissure and conduit structure the recession coefficient of spring discharge is between the fissure and conduit furthermore the recession rate in the conduit is faster than that in the fissure compared with the measured value the exponential recession equation overestimates the initial flow q 0 with a maximum relative error of 15 98 while the quadratic estimation results are close to the measured value with a maximum relative error of less than 1 5 therefore the quadratic equation can better evaluate the relationship between flow and time in the process of karst aquifer recession the results show that the aquifer structure influences the recession process of spring discharge at the outlet 5 conclusion a typical conceptual model of aquifer medium is constructed according to the characteristics of recharge runoff and discharge of hydrological system in karst areas on the basis of the conceptual model a three dimensional solid model is designed and a physical model is made regarding it through the analysis of the experimental results the following conclusions are deduced based on the present study 1 the flow process at the outlet of karst spring is modulated by rainfall intensity epikarst zone and aquifer structure the flow process curve can be divided into three stages rapid increase stage steady fluctuation stage and recession stage then the rainfall intensity has an obvious influence on the maximum peak flow confluence time and flow duration 2 the epikarst zone has not only secondary distribution effect on rainfall process but also regulation and storage effect on the runoff process the regulation and storage effect of epikarst zone will prolong the time of peak flow and delay the duration of runoff process especially without epikast zone filled the influence is manifest on the condition of f c d and f c in general the epikarst zone has a significant impact on the concentration time flow duration and curve shape of the spring flow process but has little impact on the peak flow 3 different aquifer structures will influence the seepage process the effects of fissures conduits fissures and conduits on the flow process are manifest in the shape of flow process curve confluence time peak flow time and confluence duration meantime the aquifer structure is the main factor that affects the initial flow of recession process the slope of the recession curve and the coefficient of the recession 4 the nonlinear mathematical fitting of a fractional polynomial in the recession process has high reliability but the physical meaning of fitting parameters needs to be further explored the initial discharge of quadratic fitting of traditional recession equation is closer to the measured data than that of exponential recession function 5 karst aquifer system is very complex in this paper although many factors have been taken into account there are still some shortcoming for example the water of temperature and chemistry in the process of simulation both the hydraulic head and the flow are manually read and the test needs many people to cooperate with the operation the disadvantage of manual monitoring is time consuming and there are different manual errors when different people observe however the proposed model can reflect the characteristics of karst aquifers under certain conditions and also reflects the influence of different geological conditions on the hydrological process this study using similarity experiment to explore the flow characteristics of karst aquifer medium by designing different rainfall conditions to simulate the seepage process and recession process of different aquifer structure in conclusion the establishment of the model is relatively reasonable and effective and the results of the experiment have great reference value and significance for further research credit authorship

5427,numerous aquitard drainage models for dewatering induced land subsidence have been proposed in the past most of them are based on one or more of the following assumptions including the validity of darcy s law neglect of rheological nature and constant soil properties however these assumptions may fail to reflect actual characteristics of viscoelastic aquitards for this reason the present study improves terzaghi s one dimensional 1 d consolidation model by incorporating the exponential non darcian law the merchant viscoelastic model and the nonlinear correlations between soil compressibility hydraulic conductivity and void ratio the numerical solutions for the pore pressure change are obtained using a finite volume method the expression for compaction and consolidation of aquitard is derived a parametric study and comparison between the proposed model and the terzaghi model indicate that the nonlinear permeability and the rheological nature reduce the pore pressure change and the degree of consolidation in the aquitard the effects are more apparent for an aquitard with a higher compressibility and more obvious non darcian flow nature meanwhile the reduction in pore pressure change decreases the effective stress acting on the soil skeleton resulting in smaller compaction for an aquitard with more obvious nonlinear permeability rheological property and non darcian flow nature besides although the higher nonlinear compressibility also reduces the pore pressure change yet it can induce more significant compaction in the aquitard keywords aquitard drainage model land subsidence groundwater extraction nonlinear consolidation non darcian flow 1 introduction land subsidence and subsidence related disasters due to regional groundwater withdraw have been some of the severe geology issues world wide chai et al 2004 phien wej et al 1998 xu et al 2007 previous studies have demonstrated that the compaction of aquitards plays a significant role in dewatering induced land subsidence gambolati et al 1974 helm 1976 to better predict and prevent or even mitigate the land subsidence due to groundwater extraction it is of considerable significance to depict the consolidation response of aquitards to groundwater drawdown as accurate as possible taking this into account some scholars have proposed several land subsidence models by applying terzaghi s 1925 one dimensional 1 d consolidation theory to aquitard drainage model riley 1969 1998 helm 1976 holzer 1995 in these models the water level fluctuation due to dewatering was firstly obtained based on the conventional groundwater flow theory jacob 1940 and then the vertical compaction of slow draining aquitards was calculated using terzaghi s 1 d consolidation model in terzaghi s model several assumptions for soil properties were adopted for mathematical tractability yet the properties of aquitards in many regions particularly in the coastal areas are far more complicated than the adopted assumptions in concrete terms it has been widely proven that both permeability and compressibility showed temporal and spatial variation due to pore evolution during consolidation davis and raymond 1965 hu et al 2018 poskitt 1969 li et al 2018 however such parameters have been assumed to be constant in terzaghi s 1 d model or briefly called the terzaghi model hereinafter besides the terzaghi model was initially developed based on the validity of darcy s law however for flow in clayey soils apparent deviation from darcy s law commonly occurs dubin and moulin 1986 hansbo 1960 silfverberg 1949 last but not least clayey soils are usually characterized with some special properties e g rheological behavior leroueil et al 1985 and natural structure burland 1990 tavenas et al 1983 yet such properties have not been considered in the terzaghi model for these reasons the terzaghi model often fails to illustrate the normal state of practice and cause unexpected discrepancies between theoretical results and field observations to overcome these shortcomings of the terzaghi model many improved models have been proposed davis and raymond 1965 developed a nonlinear model by assuming that the decrease in permeability was proportional to the decrease in compressibility to keep the coefficient of consolidation constant later poskitt 1969 extended davis and raymond model by removing the assumption that the coefficient of consolidation kept constant during the consolidation besides to consider the influence of non darcian flow several non darcian models including the threshold gradient model silfverberg 1949 the exponential flow model slepicka 1960 the nonlinear piecewise model hansbo 1960 were applied to improve the traditional terzaghi s theory hansbo 1997 2001 2003 li et al 2012a 2012b 2012c liu et al 2006 2009 xie et al 2007 2010 additionally some viscoelastic models e g the merchant rheological model liu et al 2012 the four component rheological model xie et al 2008 and the fractional kelvin voigt rheological model wang et al 2017 have also been adopted to depict the rheological nature of clayey soils to improve the terzaghi model according to the remarks drawn from the above investigations the nonlinear property and rheological nature of clayey soils as well as the non darcian character of flow have significant influences on the consolidation of clayey soils moreover the calculation results obtained using these improved terzaghi models are usually consistent with the observation data better than those obtained using the conventional terzaghi model li et al 2012a poskitt 1969 xie et al 2002 2008 2014 in recent years some scholars have also extended the terzaghi model by considering one or more of the above mentioned factors jin et al 2019 li et al 2017 liu et al 2013 shi et al 2018 wang et al 2018 these studies indicate that the more detailed and comprehensive description for clayey soils can help develop a more accurate consolidation model yet up until now the model considering all the above mentioned factors is still absent to better analyze the consolidation responses in aquitards to groundwater withdrawn in the underlying confined aquifer as well as their effects on land subsidence it is essential to build a consolidation model which can consider the nonlinear property and rheological nature of the aquitard as well as the non darcian nature of the flow the objective of this study is to develop a dewatering induced consolidation model for viscoelastic aquitards both the nonlinear property and rheological nature of clayey soils are incorporated in the proposed model as well as non darcian flow feature by means of a numerical method the influence of aquitard properties dewatering schemes and aquitard buried depth are investigated 2 property relationships concept model and mathematical model 2 1 property relationships related to consolidation the authors have conducted a series of laboratory tests including oedometer tests and gds triaxial tests to investigate the property relationships of the fourth soil layer of yangtze river delta near shanghai in geotechnical testing laboratory at shanghai jiao tong university chen 2002 zhang et al 2015 the primary property relationships are obtained using a best fitting method based on the test data and the results are depicted in fig 1 the nonlinear relationships between soil compressibility and hydraulic conductivity and void ratio e can be described with e e 0 c c log σ log σ 0 and e e 0 c k log k 0 log k see fig 1a and b where σ is effective stress k is permeability coefficient c c is compressibility index and c k is permeability index respectively the subscript 0 denotes the initial value of each parameter hereinafter besides from fig 1 c it can be seen that the correlation between seepage velocity v and hydraulic gradient i obeys the exponential flow law or the so called izbash law v k i m developed by slepicka 1960 better than darcy s law also as demonstrated in fig 1 d the rheological curves for the clayey soils under different loads present a similar profile and the rheological behaviors of clayey soils can be characterized using the merchant rheological model 2 2 concept model the sketch of the problem is schematically depicted in fig 2 a coordinate system is established by setting the origin at the top of the aquitard the z axis is positive downward the aquifer system consists of a phreatic aquifer and a confined aquifer separated by an aquitard the thicknesses of three soil layers are h 1 h 3 and h 2 respectively the initial groundwater level in the phreatic aquifer and the initial piezometric head in the confined aquifer are assumed to be located at the ground surface and are h 0 m above the bottom of the aquitard it is worth noting that the initial condition used here is simply for the convenience of demonstration and other types of initial conditions can be employed if needed the drawdown of groundwater level in the underlying confined aquifer is described as δh t to analyze the consolidation response in the aquitard to groundwater drawdown some underlying assumptions in the terzaghi model are retained while the others are redefined considering the property relationships for shanghai s soft soils the assumptions can be summarized as follows a the aquitard is assumed to be homogeneous isotropic and fully saturated b the soil grains and pore fluid in the aquitard are incompressible c only vertical deformation and vertical seepage take place in the aquitard d the flow in the aquitard obeys the exponential flow law proposed by slepicka e the strains are small and the creep feature is described using merchant model f the nonlinear variations of soil compressibility and hydraulic conductivity can be expressed as e e 0 c c log σ log σ 0 and e e 0 c k log k 0 log k respectively 2 3 governing equation based on the assumptions mentioned earlier the volumetric change of each soil element length width height 1 1 δz is equal to the difference of inflows and outflows base on this the continuity equation for 1 d consolidation can be written as 1 q z 1 1 e 0 e t where q is the flow per unit area or specific discharge substituting the exponential non darcian flow law q ki m developed by slepicka 1960 eq 1 becomes 2 k i m z 1 1 e 0 e t where k is a permeability coefficient or hydraulic conductivity for non darcian flow the power index m is a dimensionless parameter related to soil and flow properties i is hydraulic gradient and can be expressed as i 1 γ w u z u is excess pore water pressure or pore pressure change γ w is the unit weight of water for saturated clayey aquitards the nonlinear variations of soil compressibility and hydraulic conductivity can be expressed as 3 e e 0 c c log σ log σ 0 4 e e 0 c k log k 0 log k where c c is compressibility index c k is permeability index σ 0 is initial effective stress σ is effective stress at time t k 0 is initial permeability coefficient from eqs 3 and 4 and recalling the relationship between σ and the vertical strain ε z one has 5 1 1 e 0 e t a v 1 e 0 c c a v σ ln 10 σ t c c a v σ ln 10 ε z t 6 k k 0 σ 0 σ c c c k where a v is coefficient of compressibility substituting eqs 5 and 6 into eq 2 one has 7 z k 0 γ w m σ 0 σ c c c k u z m c c a v σ ln 10 ε z t according to the laboratory test results the merchant model is chosen to depict the rheological behavior of aquitard and the model can be described as liu et al 2013 8 ε z σ 0 σ d σ e 0 0 t σ σ 0 η exp e 1 η t τ d τ where e 0 is the elastic modulus of independent spring in the merchant model e 1 is the elastic modulus of spring on kelvin body η is viscosity coefficient of dashpot on kelvin body here the term e e 0 e 1 e 0 e 1 which is the equivalent elastic modulus of the aquitard is assumed to vary with effective stress σ based on the unidirectional compression test zhang 2002 the correlation between e and σ can be described as 9 e k m p a σ p a n where p a is standard atmosphere pressure k m and n are dimensionless parameters related to soil properties here to satisfy the correlation between void ratio e and effective stress σ described in eq 3 n is assumed to be equal to 1 thus the correlation between e 0 e 1 and k m and that between c c and k m can be described as 10 1 e 0 1 k m σ 1 e 1 11 c c 1 e 0 0 434 k m

which is the governing equation for dewatering induced consolidation in viscoelastic aquitard considering the nonlinear property of clay and non darcian nature of the flow 2 4 solution conditions with reference to the definition sketch fig 2 the pore pressure change at the bottom boundary of the aquitard is assumed to be equal to the artesian head decrease in the underlying confined aquifer for the top boundary of the aquitard its drainage condition depends on the formation condition of the layer overlying the aquitard the drainage boundary of the aquitard top can be treated as fully pervious also known as dirichlet or the first kind boundary condition when the aquitard is underlying an aquifer or can be regarded as fully impervious also known as neumann or the second kind boundary condition when the aquitard is underlying an impermeable layer there is another type of drainage boundary known as the impeded boundary gray 1945 which can be deemed as the mixed type or the third kind boundary condition for the illustration purpose the present study first considers the fully pervious and impervious drainage boundary conditions as they are distinctively different from each other for the mixed type boundary condition which is somewhat between the dirichlet and neumann conditions one can obtain the solution using similar procedures presented for the dirichlet and neumann conditions in a straightforward manner the details for obtaining the solution of the mixed type boundary condition are documented in supplementary materials further analysis of the applicability of the mixed type boundary is also documented in supplementary materials as well the following are the solution conditions of eq 13 in term of pore pressure change u 14 initial condition t 0 u 0 15a bottom boundary condition z h 2 u γ w δ h t 15b top boundary condition pervious z 0 u 0 15c top boundary condition impervious z 0 u z 0 3 numerical solutions for the proposed model because of the high nonlinearity of the proposed model it is impossible to obtain an exact and closed form analytical solution nevertheless by accepting a limited approximation error the proposed model can be solved utilizing numerical approaches in this paper the finite volume method fvm which is developed from the finite difference method fdm and is based on the conservation equation in an integral form for each control volume has been adopted to solve the proposed model 3 1 discretization of aquitard layer to solve the proposed model numerically the viscoelastic aquitard of height h 2 is discretized as shown in fig 3 the spatial domain is divided into n control volumes labelled zj with equal length of δ z these control volumes are represented by their midpoints labelled from 1 to n solid circle in fig 3 and are separated from each other by the limiting points labelled from 1 1 2 to n 1 2 hollow circle in fig 3 the solutions at the top and bottom boundary of the aquitard labelled 1 1 2 and n 1 2 respectively can be obtained based on the boundary condition meanwhile the time domain is divided into m time intervals with the same time step of δ t the kth nodal point of time domain is noted as t k and t k k δ t k 0 1 2 m 3 2 discretization of the proposed model here the discretization is implemented with the governing equation the following is the integration of eq 13 over the elementary volume δ z and time δ t 16 t k t k 1 δ z z k 0 γ w m σ σ u c u z m dzdt δ z t k t k 1 t 1 k m ln σ u σ u e 1 1 η 0 t u exp e 1 η t τ d τ dtdz then the gauss divergence theorem and a fully implicit scheme are adopted to deal with the time and spatial integral in eq 16 meanwhile taking the boundary condition into account one can obtain the discretization form eq a7 and eqs a11 a13 of the proposed model for control volumes 1 and n and the details of the discretization can be found in appendix a next one needs to discretize the initial condition of the proposed model the following is the discretization form of the initial condition eq 14 17 t 0 u j 0 0 3 3 numerical solutions to solve the derived equations eq a7 eqs a11 a13 and eq 17 the newton raphson method is adopted in this study then with the proposed solution of pore pressure change u jk the effective stress σ jk of arbitrary control volume j can be obtained based on the principle of effective stress which can be described as σ jk σ 0 j u jk then the compaction of the whole aquitard during t 0 and t k equals to the sum of the compaction of each control volume and can be written as 18 s k j 1 n 1 k m ln σ 0 j u j k σ 0 j u j k e 1 0 t k u j τ η exp e 1 η t τ d τ δ z besides supposed the ultimate pore pressure change is linearly distributed from top to bottom of the aquitard then the ultimate compaction of the aquitard can be described as 19 s j 1 n δ z k m ln σ 0 j γ w δ h t 2 j 1 δ z 2 h 2 σ 0 j where δ h t is the ultimate drawdown in the underlying confined aquifer due to dewatering finally the average degree of consolidation of the whole aquitard in term of compaction s and pore pressure change u from time t 0 to time t k can be respectively given as 20a u s s k s 20b u p j 1 n u j k j 1 n u j 3 4 solution verification to verify the validity of the proposed model and the correctness of the derived numerical solutions a comparison between the numerically and analytically calculated results for the proposed model is required however due to high nonlinearity it is impossible to obtain the exact analytical solution for the proposed model fortunately the proposed model can degenerate into the model developed by huang 2014 for the nonlinear consolidation of the aquitard due to hydraulic head drawdown in the underlying confined aquifer of which the sketch is almost identical to that depicted in fig 2 note that several assumptions including the identical change rate in permeability and compressibility c 1 and the negligence of the rheological property of soils the non darcian nature of flow and the depth dependent variation in vertical stress e 0 constant η m 1 are adopted in huang s 2014 model for the sake of mathematical tractability therefore the model developed by huang 2014 can be taken as a special case of the proposed model in this study when e 0 constant η m 1 and c 1 the other parameters in the two models are identical in this section both the analytical solutions and numerical solutions are obtained under the assumptions in huang s 2014 study the detailed derivation of the analytical solution can be found in appendix b the numerical solutions are obtained with 50 mesh points n 50 δz 0 4 m and 1000 time intervals δt 8640 s based on liu et al s 2012 study the increase of drawdown in the underlying confined aquifer due to groundwater extraction can be described as exponential equations such as δ h t h 0 1 e b t the soil sample adopted here is chosen from the first aquitard yangtze river delta in shanghai region the detailed parameters used here are given as follows h 0 5 m b 5 10 6 s 1 h 1 h 2 20 m γ w 10 kn m3 γ sat 20 kn m3 e 0 10 mpa k 0 5 10 8 m s then the numerically and analytically calculated pore pressure change with depth at different time t 5 10 25 50 100 day are plotted in fig 4 a and b as can be seen the results obtained using fvm show good agreement with those calculated based on analytical solutions indicating the validity of the proposed model and the accuracy of its numerical solutions 4 result and analysis to investigate the dewatering induced consolidation feature of the viscoelastic aquitards the scenarios listed in table 1 are designed where sce 10 represents the traditional terzaghi model while the others represent the proposed models with various soil parameters here the drawdown in the underlying confined aquifer follows the exponential equation δ h t h 0 1 e b t which is commonly used to described the drawdown due to groundwater extraction liu et al 2012 and the drainage condition of the top boundary is assumed to be fully pervious besides the related parameters in table 1 the other related parameters are given as h 0 5 m h 1 h 2 20 m b 1 10 6 s 1 γ w 10 kn m3 γ sat 20 kn m3 4 1 influence on the pore pressure change in the aquitard the calculation results for the pore pressure change u at z 9 8 m which is the grid point closest to the center of the aquitard and u at this point can approximately reflect the average level of the pore pressure change in the entire aquitard are plotted in fig 5 as can be seen the u value at z 9 8 m in each scenario holds similar development trend and it descends gradually with time until reaching a stable value however due to the influence of different soil parameters a significant discrepancy in u can be observed between the nonlinear models sces 1 9 and the linear elastic terzaghi model sce 10 at the early stage of consolidation the pore pressure change calculated by the nonlinear models is usually more significant than that calculated by the terzaghi model yet with the development of consolidation the change rate of u in the terzaghi model becomes larger than those in the nonlinear models causing the u value calculated by the terzaghi model to be larger comparing the ultimate u value in sce 10 with those in sces 1 9 significant reduction in the ultimate value of u can be observed and the reduction effect is more noticeable when k m c k or η are smaller or m is larger likewise it is easy to deduce that the response of u at the other positions in the aquitard presents a similar development law with that at z 9 8 m that is to say the ultimate u at anywhere in the aquitard calculated by the nonlinear models is smaller than that calculated by the terzaghi model thus it can be drawn that the ultimate distribution of u in sces 1 9 is also smaller than that in sce 10 as shown in fig 6 moreover the ultimate distribution is smaller when k m c k or η are smaller or m is larger which respectively denotes lower nonlinear compressibility more obvious nonlinear permeability rheological property and non darcian nature besides different from the linear distribution with depth of u in sce 10 the calculated u values in sces 1 9 are nonlinearly distributed with depth the nonlinearity of the distribution is more obvious when the ultimate distribution of u is smaller 4 2 influence on the compaction of aquitard having known the distribution of the pore pressure change in the aquitard at different time the compaction of the aquitard then can be calculated based on eq 19 and the results are plotted in fig 7 as can be seen the compaction of the aquitard in various scenarios increases gradually with time until it reaches a steady state in fig 7 a the compaction of the aquitard at a given time increases with decreasing k m different from km none of the three parameters c k η or m can directly change the compressibility of the aquitard as mentioned above the final distribution of u in the aquitard with more obvious nonlinear permeability rheological property or non darcian nature is relatively smaller leading to the effective stress acting on the soil skeleton of the aquitard is also smaller thus the ultimate compaction of the aquitard in sces 4 9 is usually smaller than that in sce 10 and it decreases with decreasing c k or η or increasing k m as can be seen in fig 7 b d 4 3 influence on the degree of consolidation of aquitard based on eqs 19 and 20a the calculation results for the degree of consolidation us of the aquitard are obtained and are plotted in fig 8 as can be seen the calculated u s in different scenarios increases gradually with time and there exists obvious discrepancy in us between the nonlinear models and the terzaghi model at the early stage of consolidation the calculated us in sces 1 9 is usually much larger than that in sce 10 and the discrepancy in u s also increases with time as the consolidation proceeds the discrepancy begins to decrease gradually and u s calculated by the terzaghi model exceeds that calculated by the nonlinear model at the late stage of consolidation until the end of consolidation here because the ultimate distribution of u in sces 1 9 is nonlinearly distributed with depth and is much smaller than that in sce 10 see fig 6 the ultimate u s in sces 1 9 is much smaller than 100 also the ultimate u s decreases with the decrease of k m c k or η or the increase of m besides the effects on the ultimate u s the soil parameters also affect the consolidation rate of the aquitard to investigate this issue normalization is performed for the curves of u s by dividing each curve with its ultimate u s the results are plotted in fig 9 as can be seen the time required to reach the ultimate normalized consolidation in sces 1 9 is considerably shorter than that in sce 10 the larger k m or the smaller η or m makes this trend more visible see fig 9a c and d indicating that the lower nonlinear compressibility the more apparent rheological property or the less apparent non darcian nature can accelerate the consolidation rate of the aquitard in addition as can be seen in fig 9 b the normalized curves with various c k almost become a unique curve indicating that the nonlinear permeability has little influence on the consolidation rate 4 4 further analysis from the above analysis it is interesting to find that the ultimate u in sces 1 9 is nonlinearly distributed with depth the nonlinear distribution further causes a noticeable reduction in the compaction and degree of consolidation of aquitard but an inevitable increase in the consolidation rate of the aquitard it seems that the nonlinear distribution of u has significant effects on the consolidation response of aquitard however the causes and mechanisms for the nonlinear distribution have not been stated clearly to investigate this issue the scenarios listed in table 2 are designed where sce 11 only considers the nonlinear compressibility of the aquitard while sces 12 14 respectively take the nonlinear permeability rheological property and non darcian nature into account based on sce 11 the related parameters are listed in table 2 and the other parameters adopted here are identical to those in the last section the results for the pore pressure change u at z 9 8 m are plotted in fig 10 the calculated u in different scenarios increases gradually with time but the change rate of u in various scenarios is quite different at a given time the calculated u becomes smaller with a decrease of k m c k or η or the increase of m causes for the reduction in u are different in various scenarios based on terzaghi s theory the causes mainly can be divided into two aspects the higher compressibility and the lower permeability in sces 11 and 13 both the larger k m and η can cause more massive compaction of aquitard resulting in the aquitard with higher compressibility in sce 12 the smaller c k can cause a more significant reduction in the permeability under the same additional effective stress leading to the aquitard with lower permeability although the parameter m does not affect the compressibility and the permeability of the aquitard yet the larger m can reduce the flow velocity when i 1 which will slow down the seepage flow in aquitard and eventually reduce the change rate of u additionally from fig 10 a and d it also can be found that the various k m and m do not influence the ultimate value of u in this situation the ultimate u in sces 11 and 14 is linearly distributed with depth in the aquitard and has no discrepancy with that in sce 10 as shown in fig 11 a and d differently from fig 10 b and c it can be observed that different c k and η not only affect the change rate of u but also influence its ultimate value the smaller c k and η can cause a larger reduction in ultimate u and induce smaller nonlinear distribution of u in the aquitard compared with that of the linear distribution of u in sce 10 as shown in fig 11 b and c from the investigation above it can be drawn that the exact causes for the nonlinear distribution of u are the nonlinear permeability and rheological property of soil not the nonlinear compressibility or non darcian nature of flow having known the causes for the nonlinear distribution of u now one can investigate the generation mechanism of the nonlinear distribution in sce 12 when dewatering measures are conducted in the confined aquifer the lower part of the aquitard suffers much more significant pore pressure change than the upper part resulting in the soil skeleton closer to the bottom boundary of the aquitard with larger compaction based on eq 6 larger soil compaction can cause more considerable permeability reduction thus the permeability of the soil closer to the bottom boundary is smaller in this situation to reach ultimate seepage stability in the aquitard the hydraulic gradient in the aquitard closer to the bottom boundary should be larger leading to the nonlinear distribution of the pore pressure in the aquitard besides the nonlinear compressibility and non darcian nature can aggravate the effect of the nonlinear permeability on the nonlinear distribution of pore pressure although either one of them does not affect the ultimate distribution of pore pressure for the scenarios considering the rheological nature the aquitard compaction s can be divided into two sections the primary consolidation compaction s e and the creep compaction s c comparing sces 11 1 and 13 1 one can see that the only discrepancy between the two scenarios is whether rheological nature is considered if the ultimate distributions of u in sces 11 1 and 13 1 are assumed to be identical then the s e values in these two scenarios are also the same however besides s e there also exists a certain s c in the aquitard for sce 13 1 which can compress the fluid and cause excess pore pressure in the aquitard thus a certain part of pore pressure change due to dewatering is offset by the excess pore pressure resulting in the nonlinear distribution of the pore pressure change in the aquitard here the nonlinear distribution can be treated as the result of dynamic balance between the pore pressure decrease due to groundwater extraction and the pore pressure increase due to creep squeeze the more obvious rheological property can cause the more apparent nonlinear distribution of pore pressure 5 effects of dewatering schemes and aquitard buried depths besides the influence of soil and flow properties dewatering schemes e g drawdown and drawdown rate and aquitard buried depths are some other factors that should be paid attention to for the consolidation of aquitard to investigate this issue some scenarios for various dewatering schemes and burial conditions are designed in table 3 here groundwater drawdown also follows the expression δ h t h 0 1 e b t adopted by liu et al 2012 for the drawdown due to dewatering in a confined aquifer besides the parameters in table 3 the other parameters adopted here are given as m 1 5 c k 0 35 k m 15 e 1 25 mpa η 50 1012 pa s γ w 10 kn m3 γ sat 20 kn m3 5 1 effects of groundwater drawdown the influence of groundwater drawdown on the consolidation response in the aquitard is depicted in fig 12 from fig 12 a it can be seen that the larger drawdown can cause larger pore pressure change u at z 9 8 m the discrepancy among each curve for u increases gradually with time until reaching its final value in fact at the other positions in the aquitard this development law is still valid taking this into account it is easy to deduce that the compaction s of the aquitard presents almost identical development law with that of u the larger drawdown can cause the larger compaction of the aquitard as shown in fig 12 b besides at a given time with the increasing groundwater drawdown the degree of consolidation increases whereas the normalized degree of consolidation almost does not change as can be seen in fig 12 c and d indicating that the groundwater drawdown can increase the degree of consolidation but has little influence on the consolidation rate 5 2 effects of groundwater drawdown rate the consolidation responses in the aquitard to various groundwater drawdown rates are plotted in fig 13 a larger drawdown rate denotes a larger decrease rate of the pore pressure at the bottom boundary of aquitard which can cause a faster decreasing rate of the pore pressure at other positions of the aquitard including its center as seen in fig 13 a moreover from fig 13 b d it can be seen that the profiles of the compaction degree of consolidation and normalized degree of consolidation versus the logarithm of time are almost identical during the consolidation a larger drawdown rate also can cause a greater change rate in the compaction degree of consolidation and normalized degree of consolidation of the aquitard yet it does not change the ultimate values of these indices the above analysis indicates that the drawdown rate mainly affects the consolidation process during the descending groundwater period and has no influence on the ultimate consolidation responses 5 3 effects of aquitard buried depth the calculation results for consolidation responses in the aquitard to various aquitard buried depths are plotted in fig 14 as shown in the figure a larger aquitard buried depth has caused a relatively larger pore pressure change but a smaller compaction and degree of consolidation in the aquitard this is mainly because of the nonlinear variations of the compressibility and permeability of the aquitard with the increase of the aquitard buried depth the compressibility increases with the increase of the initial effective stress based on eq 9 and the permeability reduction decreases under certain additional effective stress according to eq 6 thus the aquitard with a larger buried depth is usually higher in hydraulic conductivity and smaller in compressibility making the consolidation responses in the aquitard to dewatering more remarkable besides the effect of the aquitard buried depth is minimal yet it still can be seen that a larger aquitard buried depth can cause a relatively larger consolidation rate of the aquitard as can be seen fig 14 d 5 4 further analysis from the above investigation it is interesting to find that the pore pressure changes and soil skeleton compaction in the aquitard are sensitive to the variations of drawdown magnitudes or buried depths whereas the degree of consolidation is not so sensitive to them this is because a larger drawdown magnitude or a lager buried depth not only obviously changes the pore pressure change and soil skeleton compaction in the aquitard during the consolidation but also significantly affects the asymptotic u and s then according to eqs 20a and 20b the degree of consolidation only changes slightly under various drawdown magnitudes or buried depths in fact the degree of consolidation can be regarded as an index for the changing rate of pore pressure or soil compaction based on the traditional terzaghi s 1925 consolidation theory the degree of consolidation is only determined by the permeability and compressibility of clayey soils and is irrelevant to the drawdown magnitude or buried depth however because of the nonlinear permeability and compressibility of the aquitard the drawdown magnitude and buried depth can change the permeability and compressibility of the aquitard which then result in a relatively small but neglectable discrepancy in the consolidation degree of the aquitard 6 discussion the analyzed parameters can be categorized into four types the first type includes the parameters related to the compressibility e g compression index c c and viscosity coefficient η these parameters have opposite effects on the deformation and pore pressure change a larger c c and a smaller η promote the deformation of soil skeleton but decrease the change of pore pressure the second type refers to hydraulic parameters such as permeability index c k and non darcian parameter m the effects of these parameters on the soil skeleton deformation and pore pressure change are similar both c k and m can inhibit or promote the soil skeleton deformation and pore pressure change simultaneously the third type includes parameters related to dewatering schemes e g groundwater drawdown and drawdown rate these parameters firstly affect the bottom of the aquitard and such an effect can then be transferred into the upper part of the aquitard the last type mainly refers to the buried depth of the aquitard it changes the consolidation responses in the aquitard by affecting the initial value of soil parameters a larger buried depth is beneficial to reducing the compaction of the aquitard among these parameters the parameters of the first two types are not controllable yet knowing these parameters can help predict the dewatering induced land subsidence as well as some other environment responses meanwhile based on the influencing mechanisms of these parameters to reduce the adverse effects of groundwater exploitation as much as possible the site selection of pumping wells should avoid aquitards with higher compressibility or permeability or more obvious rheological nature for the last two types of parameters they can be artificially changed to mitigate the effects of groundwater level decline these parameters need to be controlled such as reducing groundwater exploitation to decrease the groundwater drawdown when groundwater exploitation is inevitable it is more advisable to exploit the groundwater from deep aquifers these measures can mitigate the adverse effects of groundwater drawdown but cannot eliminate them to this end artificial groundwater recharge is urgently required according to the analysis the calculated consolidation responses using the terzaghi model are usually more significant than those using the proposed model in many scenarios this is mainly because the traditional terzaghi model is developed based on some idealized but may not be realistic conditions these assumptions ignore some essential natures of clays by incorporating the variations of compressibility and permeability with void ratio the rheological property of aquitard and the non darcian nature of flow the proposed model can reflect the real case applications more accurately yet there still exists some shortcomings in the proposed model and further studies are required the adopted assumptions for the nonlinear rheological and non darcian properties of aquitards are obtained based on the laboratory test for shanghai s soft clay these assumptions may not work very well for the soil elsewhere besides soft clays are sometimes characterized with depth dependent compressibility and permeability as well as the structure property and plastic behavior of clays further study is needed to take into account of the effects of these factors 7 conclusions this paper presents a nonlinear consolidation model to investigate the responses of viscoelastic aquitards to groundwater extraction in the model the nonlinear relationships between void ratio and soil compressibility and permeability the rheological property of viscoelastic aquitard and the non darcian nature of flow in aquitards are incorporated the numerical solutions for the proposed model are obtained using the finite volume method and newton raphson s iterative method with which the effects of soil parameters dewatering schemes and aquitard buried conditions are analyzed the following conclusions are drawn 1 due to the nonlinear soil permeability the hydraulic gradient closer to the bottom boundary is larger leading to the nonlinear distribution of pore pressure in the aquitard the more apparent nonlinear permeability causes the more nonlinear distribution of pore pressure and the smaller compaction of the aquitard besides the more considerable permeability reduction also reduces the degree of consolidation of aquitard but has little influence on its consolidation rate 2 the rheological compaction of the aquitard can squeeze the water in the pore void and induce excess pore pressure in the aquitard resulting in the nonlinear distribution with depth in the aquitard the more apparent rheological nature causes the more nonlinear distribution of pore pressure and the smaller compaction of the aquitard besides the rheological property reduces the degree of consolidation but accelerates the consolidation rate of the aquitard 3 the nonlinear compressibility and non darcian nature of flow reduce the change rate of the pore pressure and degree of consolidation in the aquitard but have no effects on the ultimate value of these indices yet the two properties can aggravate the reduction effect of the nonlinear permeability on the pore pressure change and the degree of consolidation in the aquitard when they are considered simultaneously with the nonlinear permeability 4 the consolidation responses in the aquitard are directly related to dewatering schemes the larger groundwater drawdown rate induces the larger change rate of the pore pressure compaction and degree of consolidation in the aquitard but does not affect their ultimate value yet the larger groundwater drawdown not only causes the larger ultimate value of these indices but also increases their change rate in various degrees 5 the burial depth of the aquitard can affect the consolidation responses in the aquitard through the nonlinear compressibility and permeability of the aquitard the more considerable buried depth reduces the compressibility of the aquitard and decreases the change rate of permeability with void ratio leading to the larger pore pressure change but smaller compaction and degree of consolidation in the aquitard credit authorship contribution statement jiong li writing

greatly improved the rigorousness and quality of this paper appendix a discretization of the proposed model to discretized the governing equation the gauss divergence theorem is adopt to calculated the integral in term of z on the left hand side lhs of eq 16 thus the lhs of eq 16 for the jth control volume can be rewritten as a1 lhs k 0 γ w m t k t k 1 σ 0 σ 0 u c u z m j 1 2 j 1 2 d t then a

considering the dewatering induced pore pressure change the hydraulic gradient at the lower boundary of the control volume n can be expressed as a8 u z n 1 2 u lbc k 1 u n k 1 δ z 2 where u lbc is the pore pressure change at the bottom boundary of the aquitard which is equal to the artesian head drawdown in the underlying confined aquifer and can be described as u lbc γ w δ h t likewise the hydraulic gradient at the upper boundary of the control volume 1 can be described as a9 u z 1 1 2 u 1 k 1 u ubc k 1 δ z 2 where u ubc 0 if the drainage condition of the top boundary is fully pervious otherwise the drainage condition is considered to be entirely impervious then eq a9 is rewritten as a10 u z 1 1 2 0 substituting eqs a8 a9 and a10 into eq a7 one can express the governing equations

5427,numerous aquitard drainage models for dewatering induced land subsidence have been proposed in the past most of them are based on one or more of the following assumptions including the validity of darcy s law neglect of rheological nature and constant soil properties however these assumptions may fail to reflect actual characteristics of viscoelastic aquitards for this reason the present study improves terzaghi s one dimensional 1 d consolidation model by incorporating the exponential non darcian law the merchant viscoelastic model and the nonlinear correlations between soil compressibility hydraulic conductivity and void ratio the numerical solutions for the pore pressure change are obtained using a finite volume method the expression for compaction and consolidation of aquitard is derived a parametric study and comparison between the proposed model and the terzaghi model indicate that the nonlinear permeability and the rheological nature reduce the pore pressure change and the degree of consolidation in the aquitard the effects are more apparent for an aquitard with a higher compressibility and more obvious non darcian flow nature meanwhile the reduction in pore pressure change decreases the effective stress acting on the soil skeleton resulting in smaller compaction for an aquitard with more obvious nonlinear permeability rheological property and non darcian flow nature besides although the higher nonlinear compressibility also reduces the pore pressure change yet it can induce more significant compaction in the aquitard keywords aquitard drainage model land subsidence groundwater extraction nonlinear consolidation non darcian flow 1 introduction land subsidence and subsidence related disasters due to regional groundwater withdraw have been some of the severe geology issues world wide chai et al 2004 phien wej et al 1998 xu et al 2007 previous studies have demonstrated that the compaction of aquitards plays a significant role in dewatering induced land subsidence gambolati et al 1974 helm 1976 to better predict and prevent or even mitigate the land subsidence due to groundwater extraction it is of considerable significance to depict the consolidation response of aquitards to groundwater drawdown as accurate as possible taking this into account some scholars have proposed several land subsidence models by applying terzaghi s 1925 one dimensional 1 d consolidation theory to aquitard drainage model riley 1969 1998 helm 1976 holzer 1995 in these models the water level fluctuation due to dewatering was firstly obtained based on the conventional groundwater flow theory jacob 1940 and then the vertical compaction of slow draining aquitards was calculated using terzaghi s 1 d consolidation model in terzaghi s model several assumptions for soil properties were adopted for mathematical tractability yet the properties of aquitards in many regions particularly in the coastal areas are far more complicated than the adopted assumptions in concrete terms it has been widely proven that both permeability and compressibility showed temporal and spatial variation due to pore evolution during consolidation davis and raymond 1965 hu et al 2018 poskitt 1969 li et al 2018 however such parameters have been assumed to be constant in terzaghi s 1 d model or briefly called the terzaghi model hereinafter besides the terzaghi model was initially developed based on the validity of darcy s law however for flow in clayey soils apparent deviation from darcy s law commonly occurs dubin and moulin 1986 hansbo 1960 silfverberg 1949 last but not least clayey soils are usually characterized with some special properties e g rheological behavior leroueil et al 1985 and natural structure burland 1990 tavenas et al 1983 yet such properties have not been considered in the terzaghi model for these reasons the terzaghi model often fails to illustrate the normal state of practice and cause unexpected discrepancies between theoretical results and field observations to overcome these shortcomings of the terzaghi model many improved models have been proposed davis and raymond 1965 developed a nonlinear model by assuming that the decrease in permeability was proportional to the decrease in compressibility to keep the coefficient of consolidation constant later poskitt 1969 extended davis and raymond model by removing the assumption that the coefficient of consolidation kept constant during the consolidation besides to consider the influence of non darcian flow several non darcian models including the threshold gradient model silfverberg 1949 the exponential flow model slepicka 1960 the nonlinear piecewise model hansbo 1960 were applied to improve the traditional terzaghi s theory hansbo 1997 2001 2003 li et al 2012a 2012b 2012c liu et al 2006 2009 xie et al 2007 2010 additionally some viscoelastic models e g the merchant rheological model liu et al 2012 the four component rheological model xie et al 2008 and the fractional kelvin voigt rheological model wang et al 2017 have also been adopted to depict the rheological nature of clayey soils to improve the terzaghi model according to the remarks drawn from the above investigations the nonlinear property and rheological nature of clayey soils as well as the non darcian character of flow have significant influences on the consolidation of clayey soils moreover the calculation results obtained using these improved terzaghi models are usually consistent with the observation data better than those obtained using the conventional terzaghi model li et al 2012a poskitt 1969 xie et al 2002 2008 2014 in recent years some scholars have also extended the terzaghi model by considering one or more of the above mentioned factors jin et al 2019 li et al 2017 liu et al 2013 shi et al 2018 wang et al 2018 these studies indicate that the more detailed and comprehensive description for clayey soils can help develop a more accurate consolidation model yet up until now the model considering all the above mentioned factors is still absent to better analyze the consolidation responses in aquitards to groundwater withdrawn in the underlying confined aquifer as well as their effects on land subsidence it is essential to build a consolidation model which can consider the nonlinear property and rheological nature of the aquitard as well as the non darcian nature of the flow the objective of this study is to develop a dewatering induced consolidation model for viscoelastic aquitards both the nonlinear property and rheological nature of clayey soils are incorporated in the proposed model as well as non darcian flow feature by means of a numerical method the influence of aquitard properties dewatering schemes and aquitard buried depth are investigated 2 property relationships concept model and mathematical model 2 1 property relationships related to consolidation the authors have conducted a series of laboratory tests including oedometer tests and gds triaxial tests to investigate the property relationships of the fourth soil layer of yangtze river delta near shanghai in geotechnical testing laboratory at shanghai jiao tong university chen 2002 zhang et al 2015 the primary property relationships are obtained using a best fitting method based on the test data and the results are depicted in fig 1 the nonlinear relationships between soil compressibility and hydraulic conductivity and void ratio e can be described with e e 0 c c log σ log σ 0 and e e 0 c k log k 0 log k see fig 1a and b where σ is effective stress k is permeability coefficient c c is compressibility index and c k is permeability index respectively the subscript 0 denotes the initial value of each parameter hereinafter besides from fig 1 c it can be seen that the correlation between seepage velocity v and hydraulic gradient i obeys the exponential flow law or the so called izbash law v k i m developed by slepicka 1960 better than darcy s law also as demonstrated in fig 1 d the rheological curves for the clayey soils under different loads present a similar profile and the rheological behaviors of clayey soils can be characterized using the merchant rheological model 2 2 concept model the sketch of the problem is schematically depicted in fig 2 a coordinate system is established by setting the origin at the top of the aquitard the z axis is positive downward the aquifer system consists of a phreatic aquifer and a confined aquifer separated by an aquitard the thicknesses of three soil layers are h 1 h 3 and h 2 respectively the initial groundwater level in the phreatic aquifer and the initial piezometric head in the confined aquifer are assumed to be located at the ground surface and are h 0 m above the bottom of the aquitard it is worth noting that the initial condition used here is simply for the convenience of demonstration and other types of initial conditions can be employed if needed the drawdown of groundwater level in the underlying confined aquifer is described as δh t to analyze the consolidation response in the aquitard to groundwater drawdown some underlying assumptions in the terzaghi model are retained while the others are redefined considering the property relationships for shanghai s soft soils the assumptions can be summarized as follows a the aquitard is assumed to be homogeneous isotropic and fully saturated b the soil grains and pore fluid in the aquitard are incompressible c only vertical deformation and vertical seepage take place in the aquitard d the flow in the aquitard obeys the exponential flow law proposed by slepicka e the strains are small and the creep feature is described using merchant model f the nonlinear variations of soil compressibility and hydraulic conductivity can be expressed as e e 0 c c log σ log σ 0 and e e 0 c k log k 0 log k respectively 2 3 governing equation based on the assumptions mentioned earlier the volumetric change of each soil element length width height 1 1 δz is equal to the difference of inflows and outflows base on this the continuity equation for 1 d consolidation can be written as 1 q z 1 1 e 0 e t where q is the flow per unit area or specific discharge substituting the exponential non darcian flow law q ki m developed by slepicka 1960 eq 1 becomes 2 k i m z 1 1 e 0 e t where k is a permeability coefficient or hydraulic conductivity for non darcian flow the power index m is a dimensionless parameter related to soil and flow properties i is hydraulic gradient and can be expressed as i 1 γ w u z u is excess pore water pressure or pore pressure change γ w is the unit weight of water for saturated clayey aquitards the nonlinear variations of soil compressibility and hydraulic conductivity can be expressed as 3 e e 0 c c log σ log σ 0 4 e e 0 c k log k 0 log k where c c is compressibility index c k is permeability index σ 0 is initial effective stress σ is effective stress at time t k 0 is initial permeability coefficient from eqs 3 and 4 and recalling the relationship between σ and the vertical strain ε z one has 5 1 1 e 0 e t a v 1 e 0 c c a v σ ln 10 σ t c c a v σ ln 10 ε z t 6 k k 0 σ 0 σ c c c k where a v is coefficient of compressibility substituting eqs 5 and 6 into eq 2 one has 7 z k 0 γ w m σ 0 σ c c c k u z m c c a v σ ln 10 ε z t according to the laboratory test results the merchant model is chosen to depict the rheological behavior of aquitard and the model can be described as liu et al 2013 8 ε z σ 0 σ d σ e 0 0 t σ σ 0 η exp e 1 η t τ d τ where e 0 is the elastic modulus of independent spring in the merchant model e 1 is the elastic modulus of spring on kelvin body η is viscosity coefficient of dashpot on kelvin body here the term e e 0 e 1 e 0 e 1 which is the equivalent elastic modulus of the aquitard is assumed to vary with effective stress σ based on the unidirectional compression test zhang 2002 the correlation between e and σ can be described as 9 e k m p a σ p a n where p a is standard atmosphere pressure k m and n are dimensionless parameters related to soil properties here to satisfy the correlation between void ratio e and effective stress σ described in eq 3 n is assumed to be equal to 1 thus the correlation between e 0 e 1 and k m and that between c c and k m can be described as 10 1 e 0 1 k m σ 1 e 1 11 c c 1 e 0 0 434 k m substituting eqs 8 10 and 11 into eq 7 one has 12 z k 0 γ w m σ 0 σ c u z m c c a v σ ln 10 t 1 k m ln σ σ 0 σ σ 0 e 1 0 t σ σ 0 η exp e 1 η t τ d τ where c 1 e 0 0 434 k m c k besides effective stress σ can be expressed as σ σ 0 u substituting σ into eq 12 and setting a v 1 e 0 k m σ eq 12 can be rewritten as 13 z k 0 γ w m σ σ u c u z m t 1 k m ln σ u σ u e 1 1 η 0 t u exp e 1 η t τ d τ which is the governing equation for dewatering induced consolidation in viscoelastic aquitard considering the nonlinear property of clay and non darcian nature of the flow 2 4 solution conditions with reference to the definition sketch fig 2 the pore pressure change at the bottom boundary of the aquitard is assumed to be equal to the artesian head decrease in the underlying confined aquifer for the top boundary of the aquitard its drainage condition depends on the formation condition of the layer overlying the aquitard the drainage boundary of the aquitard top can be treated as fully pervious also known as dirichlet or the first kind boundary condition when the aquitard is underlying an aquifer or can be regarded as fully impervious also known as neumann or the second kind boundary condition when the aquitard is underlying an impermeable layer there is another type of drainage boundary known as the impeded boundary gray 1945 which can be deemed as the mixed type or the third kind boundary condition for the illustration purpose the present study first considers the fully pervious and impervious drainage boundary conditions as they are distinctively different from each other for the mixed type boundary condition which is somewhat between the dirichlet and neumann conditions one can obtain the solution using similar procedures presented for the dirichlet and neumann conditions in a straightforward manner the details for obtaining the solution of the mixed type boundary condition are documented in supplementary materials further analysis of the applicability of the mixed type boundary is also documented in supplementary materials as well the following are the solution conditions of eq 13 in term of pore pressure change u 14 initial condition t 0 u 0 15a bottom boundary condition z h 2 u γ w δ h t 15b top boundary condition pervious z 0 u 0 15c top boundary condition impervious z 0 u z 0 3 numerical solutions for the proposed model because of the high nonlinearity of the proposed model it is impossible to obtain an exact and closed form analytical solution nevertheless by accepting a limited approximation error the proposed model can be solved utilizing numerical approaches in this paper the finite volume method fvm which is developed from the finite difference method fdm and is based on the conservation equation in an integral form for each control volume has been adopted to solve the proposed model 3 1 discretization of aquitard layer to solve the proposed model numerically the viscoelastic aquitard of height h 2 is discretized as shown in fig 3 the spatial domain is divided into n control volumes labelled zj with equal length of δ z these control volumes are represented by their midpoints labelled from 1 to n solid circle in fig 3 and are separated from each other by the limiting points labelled from 1 1 2 to n 1 2 hollow circle in fig 3 the solutions at the top and bottom boundary of the aquitard labelled 1 1 2 and n 1 2 respectively can be obtained based on the boundary condition meanwhile the time domain is divided into m time intervals with the same time step of δ t the kth nodal point of time domain is noted as t k and t k k δ t k 0 1 2 m 3 2 discretization of the proposed model here the discretization is implemented with the governing equation the following is the integration of eq 13 over the elementary volume δ z and time δ t 16 t k t k 1 δ z z k 0 γ w m σ σ u c u z m dzdt δ z t k t k 1 t 1 k m ln σ u σ u e 1 1 η 0 t u exp e 1 η t τ d τ dtdz then the gauss divergence theorem and a fully implicit scheme are adopted to deal with the time and spatial integral in eq 16 meanwhile taking the boundary condition into account one can obtain the discretization form eq a7 and eqs a11 a13 of the proposed model for control volumes 1 and n and the details of the discretization can be found in appendix a next one needs to discretize the initial condition of the proposed model the following is the discretization form of the initial condition eq 14 17 t 0 u j 0 0 3 3 numerical solutions to solve the derived equations eq a7 eqs a11 a13 and eq 17 the newton raphson method is adopted in this study then with the proposed solution of pore pressure change u jk the effective stress σ jk of arbitrary control volume j can be obtained based on the principle of effective stress which can be described as σ jk σ 0 j u jk then the compaction of the whole aquitard during t 0 and t k equals to the sum of the compaction of each control volume and can be written as 18 s k j 1 n 1 k m ln σ 0 j u j k σ 0 j u j k e 1 0 t k u j τ η exp e 1 η t τ d τ δ z besides supposed the ultimate pore pressure change is linearly distributed from top to bottom of the aquitard then the ultimate compaction of the aquitard can be described as 19 s j 1 n δ z k m ln σ 0 j γ w δ h t 2 j 1 δ z 2 h 2 σ 0 j where δ h t is the ultimate drawdown in the underlying confined aquifer due to dewatering finally the average degree of consolidation of the whole aquitard in term of compaction s and pore pressure change u from time t 0 to time t k can be respectively given as 20a u s s k s 20b u p j 1 n u j k j 1 n u j 3 4 solution verification to verify the validity of the proposed model and the correctness of the derived numerical solutions a comparison between the numerically and analytically calculated results for the proposed model is required however due to high nonlinearity it is impossible to obtain the exact analytical solution for the proposed model fortunately the proposed model can degenerate into the model developed by huang 2014 for the nonlinear consolidation of the aquitard due to hydraulic head drawdown in the underlying confined aquifer of which the sketch is almost identical to that depicted in fig 2 note that several assumptions including the identical change rate in permeability and compressibility c 1 and the negligence of the rheological property of soils the non darcian nature of flow and the depth dependent variation in vertical stress e 0 constant η m 1 are adopted in huang s 2014 model for the sake of mathematical tractability therefore the model developed by huang 2014 can be taken as a special case of the proposed model in this study when e 0 constant η m 1 and c 1 the other parameters in the two models are identical in this section both the analytical solutions and numerical solutions are obtained under the assumptions in huang s 2014 study the detailed derivation of the analytical solution can be found in appendix b the numerical solutions are obtained with 50 mesh points n 50 δz 0 4 m and 1000 time intervals δt 8640 s based on liu et al s 2012 study the increase of drawdown in the underlying confined aquifer due to groundwater extraction can be described as exponential equations such as δ h t h 0 1 e b t the soil sample adopted here is chosen from the first aquitard yangtze river delta in shanghai region the detailed parameters used here are given as follows h 0 5 m b 5 10 6 s 1 h 1 h 2 20 m γ w 10 kn m3 γ sat 20 kn m3 e 0 10 mpa k 0 5 10 8 m s then the numerically and analytically calculated pore pressure change with depth at different time t 5 10 25 50 100 day are plotted in fig 4 a and b as can be seen the results obtained using fvm show good agreement with those calculated based on analytical solutions indicating the validity of the proposed model and the accuracy of its numerical solutions 4 result and analysis to investigate the dewatering induced consolidation feature of the viscoelastic aquitards the scenarios listed in table 1 are designed where sce 10 represents the traditional terzaghi model while the others represent the proposed models with various soil parameters here the drawdown in the underlying confined aquifer follows the exponential equation δ h t h 0 1 e b t which is commonly used to described the drawdown due to groundwater extraction liu et al 2012 and the drainage condition of the top boundary is assumed to be fully pervious besides the related parameters in table 1 the other related parameters are given as h 0 5 m h 1 h 2 20 m b 1 10 6 s 1 γ w 10 kn m3 γ sat 20 kn m3 4 1 influence on the pore pressure change in the aquitard the calculation results for the pore pressure change u at z 9 8 m which is the grid point closest to the center of the aquitard and u at this point can approximately reflect the average level of the pore pressure change in the entire aquitard are plotted in fig 5 as can be seen the u value at z 9 8 m in each scenario holds similar development trend and it descends gradually with time until reaching a stable value however due to the influence of different soil parameters a significant discrepancy in u can be observed between the nonlinear models sces 1 9 and the linear elastic terzaghi model sce 10 at the early stage of consolidation the pore pressure change calculated by the nonlinear models is usually more significant than that calculated by the terzaghi model yet with the development of consolidation the change rate of u in the terzaghi model becomes larger than those in the nonlinear models causing the u value calculated by the terzaghi model to be larger comparing the ultimate u value in sce 10 with those in sces 1 9 significant reduction in the ultimate value of u can be observed and the reduction effect is more noticeable when k m c k or η are smaller or m is larger likewise it is easy to deduce that the response of u at the other positions in the aquitard presents a similar development law with that at z 9 8 m that is to say the ultimate u at anywhere in the aquitard calculated by the nonlinear models is smaller than that calculated by the terzaghi model thus it can be drawn that the ultimate distribution of u in sces 1 9 is also smaller than that in sce 10 as shown in fig 6 moreover the ultimate distribution is smaller when k m c k or η are smaller or m is larger which respectively denotes lower nonlinear compressibility more obvious nonlinear permeability rheological property and non darcian nature besides different from the linear distribution with depth of u in sce 10 the calculated u values in sces 1 9 are nonlinearly distributed with depth the nonlinearity of the distribution is more obvious when the ultimate distribution of u is smaller 4 2 influence on the compaction of aquitard having known the distribution of the pore pressure change in the aquitard at different time the compaction of the aquitard then can be calculated based on eq 19 and the results are plotted in fig 7 as can be seen the compaction of the aquitard in various scenarios increases gradually with time until it reaches a steady state in fig 7 a the compaction of the aquitard at a given time increases with decreasing k m different from km none of the three parameters c k η or m can directly change the compressibility of the aquitard as mentioned above the final distribution of u in the aquitard with more obvious nonlinear permeability rheological property or non darcian nature is relatively smaller leading to the effective stress acting on the soil skeleton of the aquitard is also smaller thus the ultimate compaction of the aquitard in sces 4 9 is usually smaller than that in sce 10 and it decreases with decreasing c k or η or increasing k m as can be seen in fig 7 b d 4 3 influence on the degree of consolidation of aquitard based on eqs 19 and 20a the calculation results for the degree of consolidation us of the aquitard are obtained and are plotted in fig 8 as can be seen the calculated u s in different scenarios increases gradually with time and there exists obvious discrepancy in us between the nonlinear models and the terzaghi model at the early stage of consolidation the calculated us in sces 1 9 is usually much larger than that in sce 10 and the discrepancy in u s also increases with time as the consolidation proceeds the discrepancy begins to decrease gradually and u s calculated by the terzaghi model exceeds that calculated by the nonlinear model at the late stage of consolidation until the end of consolidation here because the ultimate distribution of u in sces 1 9 is nonlinearly distributed with depth and is much smaller than that in sce 10 see fig 6 the ultimate u s in sces 1 9 is much smaller than 100 also the ultimate u s decreases with the decrease of k m c k or η or the increase of m besides the effects on the ultimate u s the soil parameters also affect the consolidation rate of the aquitard to investigate this issue normalization is performed for the curves of u s by dividing each curve with its ultimate u s the results are plotted in fig 9 as can be seen the time required to reach the ultimate normalized consolidation in sces 1 9 is considerably shorter than that in sce 10 the larger k m or the smaller η or m makes this trend more visible see fig 9a c and d indicating that the lower nonlinear compressibility the more apparent rheological property or the less apparent non darcian nature can accelerate the consolidation rate of the aquitard in addition as can be seen in fig 9 b the normalized curves with various c k almost become a unique curve indicating that the nonlinear permeability has little influence on the consolidation rate 4 4 further analysis from the above analysis it is interesting to find that the ultimate u in sces 1 9 is nonlinearly distributed with depth the nonlinear distribution further causes a noticeable reduction in the compaction and degree of consolidation of aquitard but an inevitable increase in the consolidation rate of the aquitard it seems that the nonlinear distribution of u has significant effects on the consolidation response of aquitard however the causes and mechanisms for the nonlinear distribution have not been stated clearly to investigate this issue the scenarios listed in table 2 are designed where sce 11 only considers the nonlinear compressibility of the aquitard while sces 12 14 respectively take the nonlinear permeability rheological property and non darcian nature into account based on sce 11 the related parameters are listed in table 2 and the other parameters adopted here are identical to those in the last section the results for the pore pressure change u at z 9 8 m are plotted in fig 10 the calculated u in different scenarios increases gradually with time but the change rate of u in various scenarios is quite different at a given time the calculated u becomes smaller with a decrease of k m c k or η or the increase of m causes for the reduction in u are different in various scenarios based on terzaghi s theory the causes mainly can be divided into two aspects the higher compressibility and the lower permeability in sces 11 and 13 both the larger k m and η can cause more massive compaction of aquitard resulting in the aquitard with higher compressibility in sce 12 the smaller c k can cause a more significant reduction in the permeability under the same additional effective stress leading to the aquitard with lower permeability although the parameter m does not affect the compressibility and the permeability of the aquitard yet the larger m can reduce the flow velocity when i 1 which will slow down the seepage flow in aquitard and eventually reduce the change rate of u additionally from fig 10 a and d it also can be found that the various k m and m do not influence the ultimate value of u in this situation the ultimate u in sces 11 and 14 is linearly distributed with depth in the aquitard and has no discrepancy with that in sce 10 as shown in fig 11 a and d differently from fig 10 b and c it can be observed that different c k and η not only affect the change rate of u but also influence its ultimate value the smaller c k and η can cause a larger reduction in ultimate u and induce smaller nonlinear distribution of u in the aquitard compared with that of the linear distribution of u in sce 10 as shown in fig 11 b and c from the investigation above it can be drawn that the exact causes for the nonlinear distribution of u are the nonlinear permeability and rheological property of soil not the nonlinear compressibility or non darcian nature of flow having known the causes for the nonlinear distribution of u now one can investigate the generation mechanism of the nonlinear distribution in sce 12 when dewatering measures are conducted in the confined aquifer the lower part of the aquitard suffers much more significant pore pressure change than the upper part resulting in the soil skeleton closer to the bottom boundary of the aquitard with larger compaction based on eq 6 larger soil compaction can cause more considerable permeability reduction thus the permeability of the soil closer to the bottom boundary is smaller in this situation to reach ultimate seepage stability in the aquitard the hydraulic gradient in the aquitard closer to the bottom boundary should be larger leading to the nonlinear distribution of the pore pressure in the aquitard besides the nonlinear compressibility and non darcian nature can aggravate the effect of the nonlinear permeability on the nonlinear distribution of pore pressure although either one of them does not affect the ultimate distribution of pore pressure for the scenarios considering the rheological nature the aquitard compaction s can be divided into two sections the primary consolidation compaction s e and the creep compaction s c comparing sces 11 1 and 13 1 one can see that the only discrepancy between the two scenarios is whether rheological nature is considered if the ultimate distributions of u in sces 11 1 and 13 1 are assumed to be identical then the s e values in these two scenarios are also the same however besides s e there also exists a certain s c in the aquitard for sce 13 1 which can compress the fluid and cause excess pore pressure in the aquitard thus a certain part of pore pressure change due to dewatering is offset by the excess pore pressure resulting in the nonlinear distribution of the pore pressure change in the aquitard here the nonlinear distribution can be treated as the result of dynamic balance between the pore pressure decrease due to groundwater extraction and the pore pressure increase due to creep squeeze the more obvious rheological property can cause the more apparent nonlinear distribution of pore pressure 5 effects of dewatering schemes and aquitard buried depths besides the influence of soil and flow properties dewatering schemes e g drawdown and drawdown rate and aquitard buried depths are some other factors that should be paid attention to for the consolidation of aquitard to investigate this issue some scenarios for various dewatering schemes and burial conditions are designed in table 3 here groundwater drawdown also follows the expression δ h t h 0 1 e b t adopted by liu et al 2012 for the drawdown due to dewatering in a confined aquifer besides the parameters in table 3 the other parameters adopted here are given as m 1 5 c k 0 35 k m 15 e 1 25 mpa η 50 1012 pa s γ w 10 kn m3 γ sat 20 kn m3 5 1 effects of groundwater drawdown the influence of groundwater drawdown on the consolidation response in the aquitard is depicted in fig 12 from fig 12 a it can be seen that the larger drawdown can cause larger pore pressure change u at z 9 8 m the discrepancy among each curve for u increases gradually with time until reaching its final value in fact at the other positions in the aquitard this development law is still valid taking this into account it is easy to deduce that the compaction s of the aquitard presents almost identical development law with that of u the larger drawdown can cause the larger compaction of the aquitard as shown in fig 12 b besides at a given time with the increasing groundwater drawdown the degree of consolidation increases whereas the normalized degree of consolidation almost does not change as can be seen in fig 12 c and d indicating that the groundwater drawdown can increase the degree of consolidation but has little influence on the consolidation rate 5 2 effects of groundwater drawdown rate the consolidation responses in the aquitard to various groundwater drawdown rates are plotted in fig 13 a larger drawdown rate denotes a larger decrease rate of the pore pressure at the bottom boundary of aquitard which can cause a faster decreasing rate of the pore pressure at other positions of the aquitard including its center as seen in fig 13 a moreover from fig 13 b d it can be seen that the profiles of the compaction degree of consolidation and normalized degree of consolidation versus the logarithm of time are almost identical during the consolidation a larger drawdown rate also can cause a greater change rate in the compaction degree of consolidation and normalized degree of consolidation of the aquitard yet it does not change the ultimate values of these indices the above analysis indicates that the drawdown rate mainly affects the consolidation process during the descending groundwater period and has no influence on the ultimate consolidation responses 5 3 effects of aquitard buried depth the calculation results for consolidation responses in the aquitard to various aquitard buried depths are plotted in fig 14 as shown in the figure a larger aquitard buried depth has caused a relatively larger pore pressure change but a smaller compaction and degree of consolidation in the aquitard this is mainly because of the nonlinear variations of the compressibility and permeability of the aquitard with the increase of the aquitard buried depth the compressibility increases with the increase of the initial effective stress based on eq 9 and the permeability reduction decreases under certain additional effective stress according to eq 6 thus the aquitard with a larger buried depth is usually higher in hydraulic conductivity and smaller in compressibility making the consolidation responses in the aquitard to dewatering more remarkable besides the effect of the aquitard buried depth is minimal yet it still can be seen that a larger aquitard buried depth can cause a relatively larger consolidation rate of the aquitard as can be seen fig 14 d 5 4 further analysis from the above investigation it is interesting to find that the pore pressure changes and soil skeleton compaction in the aquitard are sensitive to the variations of drawdown magnitudes or buried depths whereas the degree of consolidation is not so sensitive to them this is because a larger drawdown magnitude or a lager buried depth not only obviously changes the pore pressure change and soil skeleton compaction in the aquitard during the consolidation but also significantly affects the asymptotic u and s then according to eqs 20a and 20b the degree of consolidation only changes slightly under various drawdown magnitudes or buried depths in fact the degree of consolidation can be regarded as an index for the changing rate of pore pressure or soil compaction based on the traditional terzaghi s 1925 consolidation theory the degree of consolidation is only determined by the permeability and compressibility of clayey soils and is irrelevant to the drawdown magnitude or buried depth however because of the nonlinear permeability and compressibility of the aquitard the drawdown magnitude and buried depth can change the permeability and compressibility of the aquitard which then result in a relatively small but neglectable discrepancy in the consolidation degree of the aquitard 6 discussion the analyzed parameters can be categorized into four types the first type includes the parameters related to the compressibility e g compression index c c and viscosity coefficient η these parameters have opposite effects on the deformation and pore pressure change a larger c c and a smaller η promote the deformation of soil skeleton but decrease the change of pore pressure the second type refers to hydraulic parameters such as permeability index c k and non darcian parameter m the effects of these parameters on the soil skeleton deformation and pore pressure change are similar both c k and m can inhibit or promote the soil skeleton deformation and pore pressure change simultaneously the third type includes parameters related to dewatering schemes e g groundwater drawdown and drawdown rate these parameters firstly affect the bottom of the aquitard and such an effect can then be transferred into the upper part of the aquitard the last type mainly refers to the buried depth of the aquitard it changes the consolidation responses in the aquitard by affecting the initial value of soil parameters a larger buried depth is beneficial to reducing the compaction of the aquitard among these parameters the parameters of the first two types are not controllable yet knowing these parameters can help predict the dewatering induced land subsidence as well as some other environment responses meanwhile based on the influencing mechanisms of these parameters to reduce the adverse effects of groundwater exploitation as much as possible the site selection of pumping wells should avoid aquitards with higher compressibility or permeability or more obvious rheological nature for the last two types of parameters they can be artificially changed to mitigate the effects of groundwater level decline these parameters need to be controlled such as reducing groundwater exploitation to decrease the groundwater drawdown when groundwater exploitation is inevitable it is more advisable to exploit the groundwater from deep aquifers these measures can mitigate the adverse effects of groundwater drawdown but cannot eliminate them to this end artificial groundwater recharge is urgently required according to the analysis the calculated consolidation responses using the terzaghi model are usually more significant than those using the proposed model in many scenarios this is mainly because the traditional terzaghi model is developed based on some idealized but may not be realistic conditions these assumptions ignore some essential natures of clays by incorporating the variations of compressibility and permeability with void ratio the rheological property of aquitard and the non darcian nature of flow the proposed model can reflect the real case applications more accurately yet there still exists some shortcomings in the proposed model and further studies are required the adopted assumptions for the nonlinear rheological and non darcian properties of aquitards are obtained based on the laboratory test for shanghai s soft clay these assumptions may not work very well for the soil elsewhere besides soft clays are sometimes characterized with depth dependent compressibility and permeability as well as the structure property and plastic behavior of clays further study is needed to take into account of the effects of these factors 7 conclusions this paper presents a nonlinear consolidation model to investigate the responses of viscoelastic aquitards to groundwater extraction in the model the nonlinear relationships between void ratio and soil compressibility and permeability the rheological property of viscoelastic aquitard and the non darcian nature of flow in aquitards are incorporated the numerical solutions for the proposed model are obtained using the finite volume method and newton raphson s iterative method with which the effects of soil parameters dewatering schemes and aquitard buried conditions are analyzed the following conclusions are drawn 1 due to the nonlinear soil permeability the hydraulic gradient closer to the bottom boundary is larger leading to the nonlinear distribution of pore pressure in the aquitard the more apparent nonlinear permeability causes the more nonlinear distribution of pore pressure and the smaller compaction of the aquitard besides the more considerable permeability reduction also reduces the degree of consolidation of aquitard but has little influence on its consolidation rate 2 the rheological compaction of the aquitard can squeeze the water in the pore void and induce excess pore pressure in the aquitard resulting in the nonlinear distribution with depth in the aquitard the more apparent rheological nature causes the more nonlinear distribution of pore pressure and the smaller compaction of the aquitard besides the rheological property reduces the degree of consolidation but accelerates the consolidation rate of the aquitard 3 the nonlinear compressibility and non darcian nature of flow reduce the change rate of the pore pressure and degree of consolidation in the aquitard but have no effects on the ultimate value of these indices yet the two properties can aggravate the reduction effect of the nonlinear permeability on the pore pressure change and the degree of consolidation in the aquitard when they are considered simultaneously with the nonlinear permeability 4 the consolidation responses in the aquitard are directly related to dewatering schemes the larger groundwater drawdown rate induces the larger change rate of the pore pressure compaction and degree of consolidation in the aquitard but does not affect their ultimate value yet the larger groundwater drawdown not only causes the larger ultimate value of these indices but also increases their change rate in various degrees 5 the burial depth of the aquitard can affect the consolidation responses in the aquitard through the nonlinear compressibility and permeability of the aquitard the more considerable buried depth reduces the compressibility of the aquitard and decreases the change rate of permeability with void ratio leading to the larger pore pressure change but smaller compaction and degree of consolidation in the aquitard credit authorship contribution statement jiong li writing

greatly improved the rigorousness and quality of this paper appendix a discretization of the proposed model to discretized the governing equation the gauss divergence theorem is adopt to calculated the integral in term of z on the left hand side lhs of eq 16 thus the lhs of eq 16 for the jth control volume can be rewritten as a1 lhs k 0 γ w m t k t k 1 σ 0 σ 0 u c u z m j 1 2 j 1 2 d t then a fully implicit scheme is adopted to deal with the time integral in eq a1 so the equation can be expressed as a2 lhs k 0 δ t γ w m σ 0 σ 0 u k 1 c u k 1 z m j 1 2 j 1 2 where the superscript k denotes time element the superscripts j 1 2 and j 1 2 denote the upper and lower boundaries of the jth control volume in addition the central difference schemes is used to calculate the partial derivative

considering the dewatering induced pore pressure change the hydraulic gradient at the lower boundary of the control volume n can be expressed as a8 u z n 1 2 u lbc k 1 u n k 1 δ z 2 where u lbc is the pore pressure change at the bottom boundary of the aquitard which is equal to the artesian head drawdown in the underlying confined aquifer and can be described as u lbc γ w δ h t likewise the hydraulic gradient at the upper boundary of the control volume 1 can be described as a9 u z 1 1 2 u 1 k 1 u ubc k 1 δ z 2 where u ubc 0 if the drainage condition of the top boundary is fully pervious otherwise the drainage condition is considered to be entirely impervious then eq a9 is rewritten as a10 u z 1 1 2 0 substituting eqs a8 a9 and a10 into eq a7 one can express the governing equations

16 a tremendous ameliorative impact of mid row mounding with plastic c was observed in the spatiotemporal salinity dynamics in the soils at all three locations salt removal efficiency les 1 an increased leaching fraction under the mid row mounding with plastic c led to considerable up to 14 6 t ha salts leaching from the crop root zone which was double the other treatments buried plastic d showed slightly better outcomes than the control or mid row mounding particularly for seasonal salt leaching in heavy textured soils salt removal efficiency les 1 in light and medium textured soils as compared to heavy textured soils indicates better salt removal in the former soils the results demonstrated that the mid row mounding with plastic is an effective technique to reduce root zone salinity in the drip irrigated horticultural crops keywords rainfall redirection mulching leaching salinity grapevine hydrus 2d 1 introduction irrigation induced soil salinization is a worldwide phenomenon especially in arid and semiarid regions where poor quality water is used for crop production it is not only impacting soil quality and reducing crop productivity but also curtailing the cultivated area and rendering the soil unfit for sustainable crop production e g cao et al 2018 poor quality water includes untreated or recycled municipal sewage water partially treated or untreated effluents spent wash from industries groundwater and drainage water which are often used for irrigating the crops as a supplement to the rainfall or a good quality source food and agriculture organization fao 2016 reported that 19 percent of the total irrigated land about 62 m ha in the world suffers from salinization every day for 20 years an average of 2 000 ha of irrigated land in arid and semi arid areas across 75 countries have been degraded by salt related degradation qadir et al 2014 it is anticipated that increased temperature and reduced rainfall projections by ipcc 2014 may intensify the risks of soil salinization and endanger sustainable crop production including high value horticultural crops such as grapevine irrigated grapevines are grown across every continent and are highly managed growing systems where water availability and its quality are often the most limiting factors flexas 2016 da silva et al 2018 in australia 90 of grapevines are grown under highly efficient micro irrigation systems abs 2015 south australia is a major grape and wine producing region in australia contributing 48 of the total wine grape crush and 93 of vineyards use supplementary drip irrigation abs 2015 but the quality of irrigation water used for grapevine cultivation is highly variable across different vine growing regions for example in mclaren vale recycled water ecw 1 0 1 7 ds m is commonly used to supplement rainfall in contrast in the south east region groundwater ecw 1 9 2 4 ds m is the dominant source for irrigating grapevines stevens et al 2012 pitt et al 2015 increased use of these waters recycled and groundwater for irrigation frequent droughts and climate change projections of diminishing precipitation are putting enormous pressure on growers to maintain and sustain viticulture production around the world e g degaris et al 2015 van leeuwen and darriet 2016 besides increased use of saline water for irrigating grapevines is posing a potential danger of soil salinization inflicting a serious impact on the long term sustainability of these vineyards stevens et al 2012 irrigated agriculture has managed the use of saline waters by leaching of salts from the rootzone depending on crop salt tolerance ayers and westcot 1985 the traditional irrigation management strategy under conditions where the supply of water is not limited is to provide extra water such that the ratio of the actual depth of drainage to the depth of irrigation i e the leaching fraction lf satisfies the leaching requirement lr fao 1994 due to the complexities of interactions between water soil and plant uptake matching of lf with lr is not straightforward dudley et al 2008 in addition the unavailability of good quality water and the complexity of implementation of lr for salinity control under drip irrigation systems may lead to enormous amounts of salt deposition laterally in the soils e g hanson et al 2008 complex soil heterogeneity and widespread stratification in australian grapevine growing areas and poor drainage conditions may also confound efforts to tackle soil salinization singh 2019 wichelns and qadir 2015 under such situations on farm water harvesting techniques such as mulching and rainfall redirection play a key role in regulating water and solute movement processes in the soil wang et al 2009 for example drip irrigation coupled with plastic mulch has been introduced over a large area in china to reduce evaporation and to optimize the efficiency of available water resources liu et al 2013 several studies have reported benefits of mulching in term of water use efficiency adhikari et al 2016 zhao et al 2014 yu et al 2018 seed emergence e g dong et al 2010 crop yield qin et al 2014 yu et al 2018 salinity control bezborodov et al 2010 abd el mageed et al 2016 soil temperature management e g li et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 and weed control e g ramakrishna et al 2006 field experiments on rainfall redirection techniques removing under vine mound and mounding in mid row with rainfall harvesting have established a reduction of the soil salinity and na and cl content in wine grapes stevens et al 2013 pitt et al 2015 however it is not clear whether these techniques apply beyond the particular combinations of water quality climate and soils at the experimental sites indeed it is worth examining the impact of these techniques on water balance root zone salinity dynamics and salt leaching in soils conducting long term experiments involving numerous variables under varied soil water and climate conditions are costly and labor and time intensive on the other hand numerical models are excellent cost effective tools to study the impact of climate soil water and crop variables on water and solute transport in the soil phogat et al 2018a among the available agro hydrological models hydrus 2d 3d šimůnek et al 2016 has been widely used to simulate water movement and salinity dynamics under drip irrigation ramos et al 2012 selim et al 2013 chen et al 2015 phogat et al 2014 2019 because of its flexibility to accommodate different types of complex boundary conditions to consider root water and nutrients uptake and its ease of use due to a user friendly graphical interface however few modelling studies have included a mulched boundary for drip irrigation e g liu et al 2013 wang et al 2014 li et al 2015 zhao et al 2018 these studies were only confined to evaluating the dynamics of water distribution in soils and the reduction of evaporation due to mulched conditions on the flat surface by considering a no flow boundary over the mulched surface simulations of water and salinity dynamics under different mid row rainwater harvesting techniques e g mounding with and without plastic and sub surface plastic coupled with drip irrigation of grapevines could potentially serve as a new concept for implementing the surface boundary in modelling studies furthermore to our knowledge no modelling study has been focussed on evaluating the ameliorative effect of rainfall directed from the mid row of horticultural crops therefore in this investigation hydrus 2d was used to evaluate the impact of different rainfall redirection and water harvesting techniques a no mounding or control b mid row mounding c mid row mounding covered with plastic and d plastic buried in the soil in mid row on water balance root zone salinity dynamics and salt balance in different grapevine growing regions loxton mclaren vale and padthaway over multiple seasons 2011 2014 involving varied soil climate irrigation quantity and quality and crop conditions the outcome of this investigation would be helpful in evaluating these innovative practices for controlling soil salinization and salt leaching for sustainable grape production 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study sites the present investigation was carried out in three grapevine growing regions in south australia sa i e mclaren vale mclaren vale region padthaway south east and loxton riverland fig 1 these sites have different climate soil irrigation water quality and growing practices representing diverse and varied conditions for grapevine cultivation the water and salt balance modeling study was conducted for three consecutive seasons 2011 12 to 2013 14 at the three locations all experimental details including soil characterization irrigation scheduling water quality crop performance and yield for these trials can be found in pitt et al 2015 stevens et al 2012 2013 and phogat et al 2017 2018b for the mclaren vale mcl padthaway pad and loxton lox sites respectively however brief site specific information about data acquisition relevant to the current study is given below 2 1 1 mclaren vale mclaren vale mcl is a premium wine grape region in south adelaide which is characterized by a mediterranean climate the climate data for the study site were obtained by running a data drill for the study site jeffrey et al 2001 the average maximum temperature potential evapotranspiration and rainfall for the last 100 years at the experimental site were 20 9 c 1568 5 mm and 555 mm respectively other data for simulations were obtained from an experimental study conducted at a commercial cabernet sauvignon vineyard 35 14 s and 138 31 e located within the region pitt et al 2015 the vineyard was planted in 1998 with a vine spacing of 2 75 m by 1 8 m the vines were irrigated with a drip system with 1 2 l h drippers spaced at 0 6 m and aligned along the length of vine rows treated wastewater for irrigation was obtained from the christies beach wastewater treatment plant and distributed through a pipeline scheme managed by willunga basin water wbw water samples were collected from irrigation emitters throughout the growing season and assessed for salinity pitt et al 2015 the average irrigation water salinity ecw during the study period 2011 14 was 1 2 ds m range 1 0 1 3 ds m the amounts of seasonal supplementary irrigation applied to grapevine at mclaren vale ranged from 86 6 to 135 3 mm during 2011 14 table 1 a comprehensive soil testing program was carried out at the mclaren vale study site due to the existence of a complex heterogeneous soil formation in this region pitt et al 2015 undisturbed core samples were collected from 0 to 15 30 60 and 60 100 cm soil depths under vine uv under the track ut and in mid row mr regions to examine the variability in soil characteristics pitt et al 2015 the soil hydraulic parameters table 2 were estimated following van genuchten mualem constitutive relationship van genuchten 1980 utilizing measured soil water retention data on undisturbed soil core samples collected from uv ut and mr regions the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks and the bulk density db were also measured on undisturbed soil cores following standard procedures klute 1986 hence input parameters represent a complex variability existing at different soil depths and laterally across the vine rows 2 1 2 padthaway padthaway 36 37 s and 140 32 e in the south east of south australia is characterized by the presence of medium textured soils underlain with limestone rocks popularly known as terra rossa padthaway pad has a warm mediterranean climate with good rainfall the average rainfall and potential evapotranspiration over the last 100 years amount to 523 3 and 1553 4 mm respectively climate parameters for modelling were taken from a nearby bureau of meteorology observatory relevant crop data for modelling was obtained from a field experiment in a commercial own rooted chardonnay vineyard located approximately 12 km south of padthaway stevens et al 2012 2013 the vineyard was planted in 1996 with chardonnay clone i10v1 salinity trends in the shallow unconfined aquifer on the padthaway flat are quite variable and are influenced by rainfall patterns and the types of irrigation practices surface drippers spaced at 60 cm were used to apply supplementary groundwater irrigation to vines with a salinity varied from 1 9 to 2 3 ds m the average salinity of irrigation water eciw over the three seasons 2011 14 was 2 2 ds m the pressure compensated drippers had a discharge of 2 1 l h in the absence of good quality surface water resources at padthaway irrigated vines were solely dependent on groundwater for supplemental irrigation seasonal water applications during the simulation period amount to 242 5 mm table 1 the soils at the padthaway study site varied from sandy clay loam at the surface to clay at lower depth stevens et al 2012 the soil hydraulic parameters table 2 used in the modelling study were estimated from measured values of the water content pressure head relationship in undisturbed cores taken from 0 to 30 and 30 100 cm other soil parameters the saturated hydraulic conductivity and bulk density for both layers were also measured on undisturbed soil cores similar hydraulic parameters were assumed at different locations across the vine lines uv ut and mr while measured initial soil salinity ece at uv down to the 80 cm depth varied from 4 to 4 5 ds m at the start of the simulation the ece at mr and ut 1 2 to 2 0 ds m respectively were less than half of that stevens et al 2012 2 1 3 loxton loxton 34 27 s and 140 34 e is a part of the riverland vineyard region which is located along the river murray corridor and utilizes the good quality river water for grapevine irrigation it has a warmer mediterranean climate and receives less rainfall compared to the other two regions the average maximum temperature potential evapotranspiration and rainfall for the last 100 years were 23 8 c 1823 mm and 265 mm respectively phogat et al 2017 the chardonnay vineyard at loxton lox was irrigated with a surface drip system the water was applied through pressure compensated drippers with a discharge of 1 6l h the plant spacing is similar to the vineyards at the other two locations the vineyard was irrigated with water from the river murray which has salinity varying from 0 2 to 0 4 ds m with a mean value of 0 3 ds m during the study period phogat et al 2018b seasonal irrigation applications were much higher at loxton as compared to the other two locations due to less rainfall and low water retention capacity of light textured soils the average seasonal irrigation over the three seasons at loxton was 378 mm table 1 the soils at the loxton site are predominately sandy in texture the soil hydraulic parameters for this modelling study were taken from phogat et al 2017 and are shown in table 2 the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks and the bulk density db were measured on undisturbed core samples using standard procedures similar soil hydraulic parameters were assumed at different locations across the vine lines under vine uv under the track ut and in the mid row mr regions furthermore hydrus 2d was calibrated and validated for spatial and temporal distributions of the soil water content over multiple seasons phogat et al 2017 2 2 modelling domain and boundary conditions for different treatments field experiments at padthaway and mclaren vale consisted of four rainfall harvesting and redirection treatments i e control a a mid row mound b a mid row mound covered with plastic c and buried plastic in the mid row region d the establishment of these treatments at field sites is discussed in stevens et al 2012 and pitt et al 2015 respectively and is shown in fig 2 for the mclaren vale site similar modelling scenarios were conducted at loxton to match the treatments at the other two sites in the control treatment actual mid row conditions show depressions in the wheel ruts due to heavy traffic associated with mechanical pruning or pre pruning fungicide herbicide spray program and mechanical harvest operations in the other treatments b c and d a shallow ripping operation and or removing the under vine mounding soil facilitated the mid row mounding operations these modifications on the soil surface are also illustrated in the modelling domains fig 3 the modelling domains for different treatments were constructed in hydrus 2d šimůnek et al 2016 based on the vine spacing drip design parameters and mid row treatments fig 3 the vine row is present in the centre of the domain which was extended equally on both sides across the vine row the vertical depth was equal to 100 cm which relates to the rooting depth of grapevines in the field experiments stevens et al 2012 pitt et al 2015 phogat et al 2017 a time variable flux boundary condition was applied to a 20 cm long boundary directly below the dripper centred on 137 5 cm from the top left corner of the soil domain fig 3 the length of this boundary was selected to ensure that all irrigation water could infiltrate into the soil without producing positive surface pressure heads because positive pressure heads at the flux boundary could make the numerical code unstable šimůnek et al 2016 during irrigation the drip line boundary was held at a constant water flux q equal to the dripper discharge rates at different locations the atmospheric boundary condition was assumed for the remainder of the soil surface a no flow boundary condition was specified on the left and right edges of the soil profile to account for flow and transport symmetry a free drainage boundary condition was assumed at the bottom of the soil profile to implement a plastic cover over the mound treatment c arcs were constructed 3 5 cm below the surface boundary and a no flow boundary condition was imposed in the domain over the plastic sheet on both sides at the desired locations see fig 3 the extent of evaporation from the soil over the no flow mulched surface was assumed equal to the losses due to wear and tear of the mulch liu et al 2013 reported that plastic mulch reduced the soil evaporation by 90 under optimum conditions however year old mulch can deteriorate and be torn apart at some places leading to significant evaporation losses essentially placing the plastic mulch below a thin soil layer helped to protect it from the hot weather and other mid row operations pitt et al 2015 another advantage of adopting this approach was to facilitate rainwater movement along the ridge mound to the lower reaches of the furrow soil this approach further allowed simulating the variable impact of dynamic pressure heads due to rainfall on flow conditions in the soils similarly for treatment d a no flow boundary was embedded into the domain at the location 10 cm below the soil surface where the plastic sheet was placed in the field studies fine mesh size was adapted below the time variable flux boundary below the dripper in all treatments to facilitate dynamic flow conditions in response to frequent irrigations all specified boundary conditions are illustrated in fig 3 simulations were conducted separately for each treatment for three years july 1 2011 june 30 2014 using daily time steps for boundary conditions 2 3 estimation of potential transpiration tp and potential evaporation es hydrus 2d requires daily values of potential tp and es under the field conditions as inputs and then calculates modelled values depending on soil moisture dynamics in this study the fao 56 dual crop coefficient approach was employed to estimate the daily values of potential tp and es for grapevine at three locations allen et al 1998 this method has been used previously in many studies for input data generation e g phogat et al 2014 2017 it combines two coefficients i e a basal crop coefficient kcb responsible for transpiration and a soil evaporation coefficient ke i e kc kcb ke with daily reference crop evapotranspiration et 0 to estimate daily crop evapotranspiration etc as follows 1 e t c k cb k e e t 0 standard kcb values for grapevine were adjusted for the local climate taking into consideration crop height wind speed and minimum relative humidity averages for the period under consideration 2011 2014 at all locations allen et al 1998 location specific parameters used to estimate daily es and tp for grapevine following the fao 56 dual crop coefficient approach for three locations are given in table 3 values of daily potential transpiration tp and soil evaporation es obtained in this way were used as time variable boundary conditions see fig 3 in the hydrus 2d model along with precipitation received at the site during the study period more details about the fao 56 dual crop coefficient can be found in allen et al 1998 and allen and pereira 2009 2 4 solute parameters for salinity dynamics in the soil soil solution salinity ecsw distribution was modelled as a non reactive solute e g ramos et al 2011 wang et al 2014 phogat et al 2014 2019 these studies demonstrated that this approach could be successfully used in environments under intensive irrigation and fertigation management the longitudinal dispersivity was assumed as one tenth of the modelling domain with the transverse dispersivity being one tenth of the longitudinal dispersivity beven et al 1993 cote et al 2003 and the molecular diffusion coefficient of salts in water was considered as 1 656 cm2 day phogat et al 2017 the data for ec of irrigation water eciw was based on the water quality analysis however average values of eciw were considered for modelling for all locations mclaren vale 1 2 padthaway 2 2 and loxton 0 3 ds m as there was only a small variation in the irrigation water quality over the study period the rainfall chemistry analyzed by cresswell et al 2010 in the adelaide region estimated the salinity ecrw of 0 12 ds m and this value was used in simulations as a common value for all locations to facilitate the prediction of the leaching of salts from the soil profile all input eciw and ecrw values were converted into mass units using a common approximation 1 ec ds m 640 mg salts l the salt leaching efficiency was estimated to compare the effectiveness of various rainfall redirection techniques it was estimated for all locations annually as the amount of salts leached below a 1 m depth per volume of water drained the initial water content distribution was set to either measured values mclaren vale and padthaway or to field capacity loxton measured values of ece in the soil were converted to salinity at actual soil water content following a linear relationship by pitt et al 2015 and to salt mass as per the approximation 1 ec ds m 640 mg salts l 3 results and discussion 3 1 seasonal water balance seasonal water balance components for grapevine under different rainfall redirection treatments at the mclaren vale site are shown in table 4 the average water balance irrespective of seasons and treatments divided the transpiration tp evaporation es and drainage dr as 39 44 and 17 of the total water application respectively among the treatments the results were similar for the mid row mounding treatment b and the control a while tp increased slightly for buried plastic d relative to the control the mid row mound plastic c maximised vine water uptake followed by the buried plastic treatment the average increase in grapevine tp in the mid row mound plastic treatment was 16 higher than the control normally transpiration root water uptake are expected to increase for sites with plastic mulch as compared to no mulch sites allen et al 1998 because temperatures are higher under mulch and root growth is promoted gao et al 2014 saglam et al 2017 at the same time there was a drastic reduction 54 in es in the mid row mound plastic treatment which may have produced higher dr especially during the 2012 13 and 2013 14 seasons therefore the average seasonal dr in mid row mound plastic treatment increased three times compared to the other treatments moreover the average soil water storage δs also increased about four times under mid row mound plastic as compared to the control the water conservation effect of plastic mulch has been documented in many previous studies for drip irrigation e g saglam et al 2017 the average water balance components at padthaway were comparable to the mclaren vale site nonetheless the average soil water storage δs at the end of the grapevine season was 5 higher and the average es component was 7 lower than at the mclaren vale site table s 1 supplementary material similarly tp and dr also increased by 7 5 and 19 almost three times respectively when the control treatments were compared on the other hand at loxton rainfall redirection techniques had a little impact on vine water uptake as tp remained similar in all treatments table s 2 supplementary material however average tp accounted for 49 of the applied water while 26 of irrigation and rainfall contributed towards es with the remaining 25 of water draining out of the soil profile 1 m drainage dr almost doubled in the mid row mound plastic treatment c compared to the control a showing the impact of surface mulching on direct water loss from the soil surface leaching fractions lf estimated for the range of treatments at the three locations are shown in fig 4 the average lf for the mounding only b and buried plastic d treatments were similar to the control a however annual lfs were influenced by the site specific soil texture and climate conditions rainfall being higher at loxton 0 15 0 25 notably lfs were considerably lower at padthaway during 2011 12 due to a relatively dry soil profile at the start of the simulation compared to the other sites later on the lf at padthaway matched corresponding values at mclaren vale on the other hand the lf in the mid row mound plastic c treatment increased on average three times at mclaren vale 0 26 0 39 and padthaway 0 16 0 4 and two times at loxton 0 31 0 4 compared to the corresponding average values for other treatments hanson et al 2008 reported similar leaching fractions 0 07 0 31 under drip irrigation which encourages rapid localized leaching especially in light textured soils indeed treatment mid row mound plastic has emerged as the most favourable treatment with increased plant water uptake a higher fraction of the evaporative flux diverted towards leaching a substantial increase in the lf which altogether can help in maintaining a favourable environment by transporting salts out of the root zone these results further confirm that plastic mulching compared to the mid row mounding was an effective on farm water management strategy that can improve the rhizosphere environment for a long term sustainable grapevine production 3 2 soil salinity dynamics 3 2 1 spatiotemporal salinity distribution in the soil the impact of the rainfall redirection techniques on spatial salinity ece dynamics in the soil at the end of 2011 12 2012 13 and 2013 14 growing seasons at the three locations is shown in fig 5 generally the ece distribution at the mclaren vale and padthaway sites in the under vine uv was higher than in the mid row irrespective of the treatment because drip irrigation applies water close to the vines rapid water extraction due to the high root density in this region results in the deposition of salts on the other hand in the mid row reduced water uptake and little salt addition via irrigation coupled with adequate rainfall induced salt flushing produced lower ece however at mclaren vale a trend towards increasing ece occurred especially in the under vine at the end of successive seasons which is correlated with proportionally higher additions of salts through irrigation coupled with less localized leaching among the treatments the bigger ece bulge was present in the under vine in the control a and the mid row mound b treatments as compared to the mid row mound plastic c at the end of the 2013 14 season the maximum ece in the under vine region was 4 2 3 5 3 0 and 3 5 ds m respectively in the control a a mid row mound b a mid row mound plastic c and buried plastic d treatments at mclaren vale however salinity remained below 0 5 ds m in a mid row mound plastic c whereas it was 0 9 ds m in the control a and mid row mound b treatments and much higher in the buried plastic d 0 9 1 5 ds m the results showed that at mclaren vale the predominance of heavy textured heterogeneous soils and high irrigation water salinity encouraged salt deposition in the vicinity of the vine this situation is similar to the poorly drained soils which potentially encourage salinization and waterlogging problems in irrigated agro systems wichelns and qadir 2015 singh 2019 at padthaway the extent of ece distribution in the soil was much greater than at mclaren vale irrespective of regions and treatments because the initial salinity in the under vine 4 4 5 ds m and mid row 1 2 1 8 ds m regions was very high compared to the other two sites apparently the high eciw of the irrigation water 2 0 2 35 ds m coupled with medium to heavy textured soils with low hydraulic conductivity 11 26 cm day is conducive to salt deposition within the soil profile in the immediate vicinity of the vine under vine region where irrigation is applied through drippers therefore pockets of high ece 5 5 7 0 ds m at padthaway still existed under the vine below the 50 cm depth in all treatments except mid row mound plastic at the end of the 2011 12 vine growing season fig 5ii the maximum salinity zone had an average ece from 3 5 to 4 0 ds m at the end of 2013 14 however this zone spreads over a large area in the control a and mod row mound b treatments as compared to buried plastic d where it was restricted within a small region mostly in the deeper zone of the profile in mid row mound plastic c a significant volume of water passed through the zone of high salinity pushing the salts out of the profile consequently salinity was greatly reduced during the first season during the following seasons 2012 13 2013 14 the soil profile salinity was reduced below threshold 2 2 ds m in almost the entire mid row whereas pockets of higher salinity existed in the under vine below 30 cm hence treatment mid row mound plastic c continued to be by far the most effective at salt removal compared to the other treatments interestingly at loxton ece remained lower in the uv region as compared to mr irrespective of the rainfall redirection treatments fig 5iii at the end of the 3rd season 2013 14 a low ece zone 0 5 ds m increased laterally in all treatments the presence of sandy soils and a three times higher amount of irrigation water of eciw of 0 3 ds m applied within a localized region facilitated rapid leaching of the salts in contrast eciw at mclaren vale and padthaway was 4 and 7 times higher respectively than at loxton which potentially added an enormous quantity of salts in the soil in the under vine area in these drip irrigated vineyards ece in the soil profile always remained below the grapevine threshold 2 2 ds m in all treatments the buried plastic treatment allowed a small amount of salt deposition just below the plastic this is due to the plastic membrane blocking vertical drainage of water and promoting lateral salt migration to the area underneath the plastic in mid row mound plastic c the low salinity zone 0 5 ds m extended further under the vine compared to the other treatments it is also evident that most of the irrigation induced salts were leached out of the 1 m soil profile hence the current irrigation amount and quality of water did not pose any salinity threat in the root zone of the vine irrespective of treatments christen et al 2007 showed a similar impact on the salinity distribution when using good quality irrigation water in a loamy soil daily profile averaged ece in the under vine and mid row regions at the mclaren vale and padthaway sites are shown in fig 6 data for the loxton site is not shown as the salinity levels were much lower than the grapevine threshold ece of 2 2 ds m zhang et al 2002 a progressive increase in ece was found at mclaren vale in all treatments over the three seasons except in mid row mound plastic c where ece remained almost constant 0 5 ds m ece 0 9 ds m in buried plastic d was maximum in the mid row region at the end of the simulation despite increasing trends ece remained below the crop threshold in the mid row region in all treatments on the other hand it increased above the threshold in the under vine during the latter half of 2013 14 irrespective of treatments it seems that heavy textured soils with enormous profile heterogeneity and anisotropic flow conditions pitt et al 2015 have played a crucial role in nullifying the treatment impact at mclaren vale compared to the other padthaway at the padthaway site the average ece in the mr region remained below the threshold in all treatments except buried plastic d interestingly in this treatment ece under the mid row increased above the threshold during the 2013 14 growing season buried plastic possibly harboured more salts directly below the plastic layer due to the blockage of vertical drainage as was also seen at loxton also fig 5 however the average ece in the under vine reduced drastically in all treatments after an initial increase during the 2011 12 summers although it remained higher than the grapevine threshold 2 2 ds m the impact of the rainfall redirection was very dramatic in the mid row mound plastic c treatment where ece fell below the threshold during the post winter season of 2013 14 the mean ece in the buried plastic d treatment falls between values obtained in the control a and mid row mound plastic c treatments in the under vine area in other studies also mulching has been found to be a better field management option to reduce the upward movement of salts and evaporative water losses zhao et al 2014 chen et al 2016 and that mulching with different materials is a promising technique for salinity control in agriculture bezborodov et al 2010 abd el mageed et al 2016 the mid row mound plastic treatment c maintained relatively lower salinity within the vine root zone as compared to the other treatments especially for recycled water and groundwater irrigated grapevines with heavier textured soils providing a better growing environment for vine and a superior salt leaching approach as compared to other techniques the results of the modelling suggest that the treatments behaved differently at different locations and the impact on the ece distribution under grapevine due to rainfall redirection techniques depends on combined effects of the soil type water quality and weather conditions 3 3 seasonal salt balance salt balance dynamics in the soil under different rainfall redirection techniques is shown in table 5 there were different initial amounts of salts in the soils at different sites due to textural differences and the quantity and quality of water used for grape production at padthaway initial salt contents 8298 kg ha in the soil profile were 3 5 and 5 times higher than at mclaren vale and loxton respectively the annual amount of salts added through irrigation i s during the simulation period 2011 to 2014 varied from 631 to 1038 and from 900 to 1200 kg ha at the mclaren vale and loxton sites respectively however almost similar amounts of i s 3352 8 kg ha were added annually at padthaway during different years due to less variation in the seasonal irrigation volumes additionally the amount of salts added through the rain p s at mclaren vale 302 434 kg ha padthaway 308 408 kg ha and loxton 136 to 247 kg ha were much lower as compared to salts added through irrigation during the same period although salt additions in the soil in different treatments were similar salt storage δs s and leaching dr s altered due to different rainfall redirection techniques table 5 interestingly all treatments showed an increased amount of salt remaining in the profile at mclaren vale and padthaway except mid row mound plastic during all seasons where recycled water and groundwater were used for irrigation respectively on the other hand at loxton salt leaching was very rapid and a high amount of leaching occurred compared to the amount added through irrigation and rainfall table 5 therefore there was a net depletion of salts from the soil at the end of the 2013 14 season in all treatments similarly the average salts storage at padthaway in the mid row mound plastic c treatment was reduced by half as compared to the other treatments due to a rapid increase in the drainage flux which however was not sufficient to flush all salts out of the soil profile this suggests that soil texture and heterogeneity play an important role in the transient salt storage in the soil the average annual amount of salts leaching dr s in the control treatment a at each of the study sites remained almost similar to the mid row mounding b over the three seasons table 5 similarly the dynamics of daily salts leaching in these treatments a and b almost overlapped over the entire simulation period 2011 2014 at all locations except for slight deviations at loxton fig 6 this suggests that mid row mounding b had a small impact on salts leaching from the root zone irrespective of soil water and climate conditions however the mid row mound plastic c treatment resulted in more than twice the average salt mass removed 884 kg ha as compared to the control 406 kg ha at mclaren vale similarly the buried plastic d treatment also showed higher average salts leaching 563 kg ha than the control a at loxton although the average amount 4860 kg ha of salts leached dr s at padthaway in the mid row mound plastic treatment c was more than one and half times of the control a it was about five times the corresponding amount at mclaren vale it is estimated that about 14 6 t ha salts were leached during 2011 14 at padthaway in the mid row mound plastic treatment c which was 57 higher than for the control total salt leaching in other treatments ranged from 9 3 to 9 7 t ha the drastic increase in the salt leaching in the mid row mound plastic c treatment occurred due to the two pronged strategy of the redirection of rainfall and the reduction of evaporation losses due to the surface cover it can be seen that the drainage flux 6 7 ml ha in this treatment was more than double as compared to the other treatments 2 6 2 7 ml ha table 4 differences in daily salt leaching in different treatments and at different locations are also distinctly visible during the entire simulation period fig 6 high episodic salts leaching peaks occurred especially at the mclaren vale and padthaway sites whereas leaching was a continuous process in the sandy soil at loxton typically large peaks at all locations were preceded by high rainfall events and were also influenced by the amount of salts present in the soil notably at padthaway huge amounts of salts 3 35 t ha yr are added in the soils see table 5 through high salinity 2 2 2 35 ds m groundwater irrigation which are deposited in the soil and ready to be transported following large rainfall events generating large leaching fractions indeed the huge amount of salt leaching at padthaway irrespective of treatments may raise salinity concerns for shallow groundwater aquifers a groundwater monitoring study observed an increase in the salt contents by about 600 mg l in shallow aquifers from around 800 mg l to 1400 mg l in parts of padthaway during the last 25 years cleugh 2006 apparently excessive transport of irrigation induced root zone salts under grapevine may pose a potential danger for the groundwater quality hence a trade off exists between the extent of leaching and the imminent threat of groundwater degradation and judicious decisions are required for sustainable salinity management and controlling the pollution of groundwater 3 4 leaching efficiency and leaching requirement salt removal leaching efficiency les is defined as the ratio of the amount of salts leached from the soil profile and the corresponding amount added during a given time e g an annual or crop cycle which offers a more quantitative measure of the salt balance to compare different treatments lu et al 2019 at mclaren vale the les remained less than one irrespective of treatments and seasons indicating an overall tendency of salt deposition in the root zone fig 7 however les increased almost two fold in the mid row mound plastic c treatment compared to the control and mid row mounding and varied from 0 63 to 0 77 kg salts leached kg added interestingly at padthaway during 2011 12 les was very low average 0 12 0 13 kg leached kg salts added in all of the treatments besides mid row mound plastic 1 04 kg leached kg added in the later years of the simulation it reached a value larger than one 1 01 only under the mid row mounding during 2013 14 and the buried plastic 1 37 during 2012 13 however les remained above one in mid row mound plastic c during all seasons and reached a maximum value of 1 81 kg salts leached kg added during 2012 13 therefore only the mid row mound plastic c treatment showed continuous depletion of salts from the soil at padthaway the les remained larger than one at loxton irrespective of treatments and seasons indicating a strong depletion pattern however the mid row mound plastic c treatment had a maximum les value of 1 74 kg salts kg salts applied during 2011 12 hence the occurrence of les larger than one at loxton is attributed to the prevalence of highly permeable sandy soils low salinity of irrigation water 0 3 ds m and almost double amount of irrigation application than at the other sites which facilitated the rapid flushing of salts from the root zone in drip irrigated systems it is hard to determine the leaching requirement lr due to spatially variable soil wetting patterns that lead to localized leaching below the drip line hanson et al 2008 historically lr is the lf which when passed through the root zone reduces the root zone salts below the crop threshold hence in drip irrigation systems a lf that corresponds to les 1 can potentially leach annually added salts from the root zone it can serve as a good estimate for leaching of irrigation induced salts from the root zone hence a site specific relationship was developed between a seasonal lf and corresponding les at different locations irrespective of treatments fig 8 at lox sandy soils a very low lf 0 1 was found to rapidly attain les 1 while at padthaway medium textured soils the threshold lf was 0 18 the threshold lf for the mclaren vale site heavy textured heterogeneous soils was exceptionally high 0 74 which seems impractical however in the mid row mound plastic treatment c an average lf of 0 33 was able to flush 70 of added salts at mclaren vale thus showing promising results on the other hand this soil has restricted drainage conditions singh 2019 especially in the subsoils which may require different management options for salinity control overall the mid row mound covered with plastic c was the most efficient technique for leaching salt from the root zone and attaining les 1 especially at padthaway salt leaching results were extremely variable as influenced by soil texture and heterogeneity these techniques should be adopted cautiously depending on the soil climate and irrigation water quality at a particular location the main drawback of the plastic mulch is its cost its labour intensive application and environmental risk of plastic residues in the soil silin and xujian 2008 changrong et al 2014 these issues need due consideration before implementing the mounding with plastic strategy although biodegradable plastic mulching adhikari et al 2016 saglam et al 2017 chen et al 2019 2020 or sprayable biodegradable polymer membrane filipović et al 2020 are viable options for addressing the environmental issues other options of environmentally friendly mulching such as compost wood chips and plant residues are also available the application of organic mulches is equally labour intensive but they have numerous other beneficial impacts such as increasing soil water retention granatstein and mullinix 2008 yu et al 2018 and enhancing soil organic matter nutrient cycling and n availability neilsen et al 2003 sanchez et al 2003 hoagland et al 2008 teravest et al 2010 on the other hand they also have adverse impacts such as causing tree root diseases rodent infestation merwin and stiles 1994 and weed seed distribution rowley et al 2011 moreover their role in redirecting rainfall salts dynamics and leaching seems limited and not yet fully explored therefore the use of plastic mulches still seems to be a relatively better alternative if the overall goal is to reduce the soil salinization and leaching of soluble salts from the crop root zone 4 conclusions leaching of soluble salts from an irrigated soil root zone is necessary for sustainable crop production since all water additions and subsequent evaporation and transpiration will increase salt concentrations this investigation was carried out to understand the impact of different mid row management techniques such as mounding and plastic mulching for directing rainfall for reducing salt accumulation in the root zone of drip irrigated grapevines four different treatments no mounding or control a mid row mounding b mid row mounding covered with plastic c and plastic buried in the soil in the mid row d were evaluated using a numerical model hydrus 2d for simulating the water balance root zone salinity dynamics ece and salt dynamics in the soil for multiple seasons 2011 2014 in three grape growing regions these vines had been irrigated with varied water qualities ranging from river water 0 2 0 5 ds m at loxton recycled water 1 0 1 3 ds m at mclaren vale and groundwater 1 9 2 3 ds m at padthaway results demonstrated that mid row mounding with plastic mulching c was effective at controlling salinity under drip irrigated grapevines it showed a threefold increase in drainage flux dr a drastic reduction in evaporation es 48 54 and an increase in transpiration tp of grapevine 1 16 as compared to the control a despite such remarkable impacts of mid row mounding coupled with plastic mulch soil texture and the quantity and quality of irrigation water have played an important role in controlling salt transport in the soil modelling simulations confirmed that in heavy textured highly heterogeneous soils mclaren vale site in vineyards irrigated with recycled water eciw 1 2 ds m this treatment in spite of one and half times higher salts leaching than in the other treatments could not maintain a salt removal efficiency les 1 over the simulation period therefore the final average profile ece in the under vine uv region increased from 1 1 to 2 4 ds m which is more than the salinity tolerance threshold 2 2 ds m for grapevines groundwater irrigated eciw 2 2 2 35 ds m grapevines on medium textured soils padthaway site with double the irrigation amount compared to mclaren vale and a similar annual rainfall maintained les 1 during all three seasons reduced the average ece in the uv region from 5 2 to 3 2 ds m a leaching fraction of 0 18 was found to leach all annually added salts out of the root zone in the latter soils these results suggest that rainfall redirection techniques have the potential to play an important role in reducing root zone salts still the extent of the reduction will vary depending on the soil and agro climatic zone the requirement for salt removal from the soil is influenced by soil texture soil heterogeneity irrigation quantity and quality rainfall volume distribution and intensity and the salinity tolerance threshold of the

5428,altering the soil surface features can potentially regulate water and solute movement processes in the soils and reduce the accumulation of salts in the plant root zone in this study hydrus 2d was used consecutively for three years 2011 2014 to evaluate the potential impact of different rainfall redirection and water harvesting techniques such as no mounding or control a mid row mounding b

control mounding mid row soils b did not significantly alter the water balance at any site adding an impermeable plastic layer to that mound c reduced es 48 54 and increased dr by two thirds and tp 1 16 a tremendous ameliorative impact of mid row mounding with plastic c was observed in the spatiotemporal salinity dynamics in the soils at all three locations salt removal efficiency les 1 an increased leaching fraction under the mid row mounding with plastic c led to considerable up to 14 6 t ha salts leaching from the crop root zone which was double the other treatments buried plastic d showed slightly better outcomes than the control or mid row mounding particularly for seasonal salt leaching in heavy textured soils salt removal efficiency les 1 in light and medium textured soils as compared to heavy textured soils indicates better salt removal in the former soils the results demonstrated that the mid row mounding with plastic is an effective technique to reduce root zone salinity in the drip irrigated horticultural crops keywords rainfall redirection mulching leaching salinity grapevine hydrus 2d 1 introduction irrigation induced soil salinization is a worldwide phenomenon especially in arid and semiarid regions where poor quality water is used for crop production it is not only impacting soil quality and reducing crop productivity but also curtailing the cultivated area and rendering the soil unfit for sustainable crop production e g cao et al 2018 poor quality water includes untreated or recycled municipal sewage water partially treated or untreated effluents spent wash from industries groundwater and drainage water which are often used for irrigating the crops as a supplement to the rainfall or a good quality source food and agriculture organization fao 2016 reported that 19 percent of the total irrigated land about 62 m ha in the world suffers from salinization every day for 20 years an average of 2 000 ha of irrigated land in arid and semi arid areas across 75 countries have been degraded by salt related degradation qadir et al 2014 it is anticipated that increased temperature and reduced rainfall projections by ipcc 2014 may intensify the risks of soil salinization and endanger sustainable crop production including high value horticultural crops such as grapevine irrigated grapevines are grown across every continent and are highly managed growing systems where water availability and its quality are often the most limiting factors flexas 2016 da silva et al 2018 in australia 90 of grapevines are grown under highly efficient micro irrigation systems abs 2015 south australia is a major grape and wine producing region in australia contributing 48 of the total wine grape crush and 93 of vineyards use supplementary drip irrigation abs 2015 but the quality of irrigation water used for grapevine cultivation is highly variable across different vine growing regions for example in mclaren vale recycled water ecw 1 0 1 7 ds m is commonly used to supplement rainfall in contrast in the south east region groundwater ecw 1 9 2 4 ds m is the dominant source for irrigating grapevines stevens et al 2012 pitt et al 2015 increased use of these waters recycled and groundwater for irrigation frequent droughts and climate change projections of diminishing precipitation are putting enormous pressure on growers to maintain and sustain viticulture production around the world e g degaris et al 2015 van leeuwen and darriet 2016 besides increased use of saline water for irrigating grapevines is posing a potential danger of soil salinization inflicting a serious impact on the long term sustainability of these vineyards stevens et al 2012 irrigated agriculture has managed the use of saline waters by leaching of salts from the rootzone depending on crop salt tolerance ayers and westcot 1985 the traditional irrigation management strategy under conditions where the supply of water is not limited is to provide extra water such that the ratio of the actual depth of drainage to the depth of irrigation i e the leaching fraction lf satisfies the leaching requirement lr fao 1994 due to the complexities of interactions between water soil and plant uptake matching of lf with lr is not straightforward dudley et al 2008 in addition the unavailability of good quality water and the complexity of implementation of lr for salinity control under drip irrigation systems may lead to enormous amounts of salt deposition laterally in the soils e g hanson et al 2008 complex soil heterogeneity and widespread stratification in australian grapevine growing areas and poor drainage conditions may also confound efforts to tackle soil salinization singh 2019 wichelns and qadir 2015 under such situations on farm water harvesting techniques such as mulching and rainfall redirection play a key role in regulating water and solute movement processes in the soil wang et al 2009 for example drip irrigation coupled with plastic mulch has been introduced over a large area in china to reduce evaporation and to optimize the efficiency of available water resources liu et al 2013 several studies have reported benefits of mulching

mound and mounding in mid row with rainfall harvesting have established a reduction of the soil salinity and na and cl content in wine grapes stevens et al 2013 pitt et al 2015 however it is not clear whether these techniques apply beyond the particular combinations of water quality climate and soils at the experimental sites indeed it is worth examining the impact of these techniques on water balance root zone salinity dynamics and salt leaching in soils conducting long term experiments involving numerous variables under varied soil water and climate conditions are costly and labor and time intensive on the other hand numerical models are excellent cost effective tools to study the impact of climate soil water and crop variables on water and solute transport in the soil phogat et al 2018a among the available agro hydrological models hydrus 2d 3d šimůnek et al 2016 has been widely used to simulate water movement and salinity dynamics under drip irrigation ramos et al 2012 selim et al 2013 chen et al 2015 phogat et al 2014 2019 because of its flexibility to accommodate different types of complex boundary conditions to consider root water and nutrients uptake and its ease of use due to a user friendly graphical interface however few modelling studies have included a mulched boundary for drip irrigation e g liu et al 2013 wang et al 2014 li et al 2015 zhao et al 2018 these studies were only confined to evaluating the dynamics of water distribution in soils and the reduction of evaporation due to mulched conditions on the flat surface by considering a no flow boundary over the mulched surface simulations of water and salinity dynamics under different mid row rainwater harvesting techniques e g mounding with and without plastic and sub surface plastic coupled with drip irrigation of grapevines could potentially serve as a new concept for implementing the surface boundary in modelling studies furthermore to our knowledge no modelling study has been focussed on evaluating the ameliorative effect of rainfall directed from the mid row of horticultural crops therefore in this investigation hydrus 2d was used to evaluate the impact of different rainfall redirection and water harvesting techniques a no mounding or control b mid row mounding c mid row mounding covered with plastic and d plastic buried in the soil in mid row on water balance root zone salinity dynamics and salt balance in different grapevine growing regions loxton mclaren vale and padthaway over multiple seasons 2011 2014 involving varied soil climate irrigation quantity and quality and crop conditions the outcome of this investigation would be helpful in evaluating these innovative practices for controlling soil salinization and salt leaching for sustainable grape production 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study sites the present investigation was carried out in three grapevine growing regions in south australia sa i e mclaren vale mclaren vale region padthaway south east and loxton riverland fig 1 these sites have different climate soil irrigation water quality and growing practices representing diverse and varied conditions for grapevine cultivation the water and salt balance modeling study was conducted for three consecutive seasons 2011 12 to 2013 14 at the three locations all experimental details including soil characterization irrigation scheduling water quality crop performance and yield for these trials can be found in pitt et al 2015 stevens et al 2012 2013 and phogat et al 2017 2018b for the mclaren vale mcl padthaway pad and loxton lox sites respectively however brief site specific information about data acquisition relevant to the current study is given below 2 1 1 mclaren vale mclaren vale mcl is a premium wine grape region in south adelaide which is characterized by a mediterranean climate the climate data for the study site were obtained by running a data drill for the study site jeffrey et al 2001 the average maximum temperature potential evapotranspiration and rainfall for the last 100 years at the experimental site were 20 9 c 1568 5 mm and 555 mm respectively other data for simulations were obtained from an experimental study conducted at a commercial cabernet sauvignon vineyard 35 14 s and 138 31 e located within the region pitt et al 2015 the vineyard was planted in 1998 with a vine spacing of 2 75 m by 1 8 m the vines were irrigated with a drip system with 1 2 l h drippers spaced at 0 6 m and aligned along the length of vine rows treated wastewater for irrigation was obtained from the christies beach wastewater treatment plant and distributed through a pipeline scheme managed by willunga basin water wbw water samples were collected from irrigation emitters throughout the growing season and assessed for salinity pitt et al 2015 the average irrigation water salinity ecw during the study period 2011 14 was 1 2 ds m range 1 0 1 3 ds m the amounts of seasonal supplementary irrigation applied to grapevine at mclaren vale ranged from 86 6 to 135 3 mm during 2011 14 table 1 a comprehensive soil testing program was carried out at the mclaren vale study site due to the existence of a complex heterogeneous soil formation in this region pitt et al 2015 undisturbed core samples were collected from 0 to 15 30 60 and 60 100 cm soil depths under vine uv under the track ut and in mid row mr regions to examine the variability in soil characteristics pitt et al 2015 the soil hydraulic parameters table 2 were estimated following van genuchten mualem constitutive relationship van genuchten 1980 utilizing measured soil water retention data on undisturbed soil core samples collected from uv ut and mr regions the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks and the bulk density db were also measured on undisturbed soil cores following standard procedures klute 1986 hence input parameters represent a complex variability existing at different soil depths and laterally across the vine rows 2 1 2 padthaway padthaway 36 37 s and 140 32 e in the south east of south australia is characterized by the presence of medium textured soils underlain with limestone rocks popularly known as terra rossa padthaway pad has a warm mediterranean climate with good rainfall the average rainfall and potential evapotranspiration over the last 100 years amount to 523 3 and 1553 4 mm respectively climate parameters for modelling were taken from a nearby bureau of meteorology observatory relevant crop data for modelling was obtained from a field experiment in a commercial own rooted chardonnay vineyard located approximately 12 km south of padthaway stevens et al 2012 2013 the vineyard was planted in 1996 with chardonnay clone i10v1 salinity trends in the shallow unconfined aquifer on the padthaway flat are quite variable and are influenced by rainfall patterns and the types of irrigation practices surface drippers spaced at 60 cm were used to apply supplementary groundwater irrigation to vines with a salinity varied from 1 9 to 2 3 ds m the average salinity of irrigation water eciw over the three seasons 2011 14 was 2 2 ds m the pressure compensated drippers had a discharge of 2 1 l h in the absence of good quality surface water resources at padthaway irrigated vines were solely dependent on groundwater for supplemental irrigation seasonal water applications during the simulation period amount to 242 5 mm table 1 the soils at the padthaway study site varied from sandy clay loam at the surface to clay at lower depth stevens et al 2012 the soil hydraulic parameters table 2 used in the modelling study were estimated from measured values of the water content pressure head relationship in undisturbed cores taken from 0 to 30 and 30 100 cm other soil parameters the saturated hydraulic conductivity and bulk density for both layers were also measured on undisturbed soil cores similar hydraulic parameters were assumed at different locations across the vine lines uv ut and mr while measured initial soil salinity ece at uv down to the 80 cm depth varied from 4 to 4 5 ds m at the start of the simulation the ece at mr and ut 1 2 to 2 0 ds m respectively were less than half of that stevens et al 2012 2 1 3 loxton loxton 34 27 s and 140 34 e is a part of the riverland vineyard region which is located along the river murray corridor and utilizes the good quality river water for grapevine irrigation it has a warmer mediterranean climate and receives less rainfall compared to the other two regions the average maximum temperature potential evapotranspiration and rainfall for the last 100 years were 23 8 c 1823 mm and 265 mm respectively phogat et al 2017 the chardonnay vineyard at loxton lox was irrigated with a surface drip system the water was applied through pressure compensated drippers with a discharge of 1 6l h the plant spacing is similar to the vineyards at the other two locations the vineyard was irrigated with water from the river murray which has salinity varying from 0 2 to 0 4 ds m with a mean value of 0 3 ds m during the study period phogat et al 2018b seasonal irrigation applications were much higher at loxton as compared to the other two locations due to less rainfall and low water retention capacity of light textured soils the average seasonal irrigation over the three seasons at loxton was 378 mm table 1 the soils at the loxton site are predominately sandy in texture the soil hydraulic parameters for this modelling study were taken from phogat et al 2017 and are shown in table 2 the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks and the bulk density db were measured on undisturbed core samples using standard procedures similar soil hydraulic parameters were assumed at different locations across the vine lines under vine uv under the track ut and in the mid row mr regions furthermore hydrus 2d was calibrated and validated for spatial and temporal distributions of the soil water content over multiple seasons phogat et al 2017 2 2 modelling domain and boundary conditions for different treatments field experiments at padthaway and mclaren vale consisted of four rainfall harvesting and redirection treatments i e control a a mid row mound b a mid row mound covered with plastic c and buried plastic in the mid row region d the establishment of these treatments at field sites is discussed in stevens et al 2012 and pitt et al 2015 respectively and is shown in fig 2 for the mclaren vale site similar modelling scenarios were conducted at loxton to match the treatments at the other two sites in the control treatment actual mid row conditions show depressions in the wheel ruts due to heavy traffic associated with mechanical pruning or pre pruning fungicide herbicide spray program and mechanical harvest operations in the other treatments b c and d a shallow ripping operation and or removing the under vine mounding soil facilitated the mid row mounding operations these modifications on the soil surface are also illustrated in the modelling domains fig 3 the modelling domains for different treatments were constructed in hydrus 2d šimůnek et al 2016 based on the vine spacing drip design parameters and mid row treatments fig 3 the vine row is present in the centre of the domain which was extended equally on both sides across the vine row the vertical depth was equal to 100 cm which relates to the rooting depth of grapevines in the field experiments stevens et al 2012 pitt et al 2015 phogat et al 2017 a time variable flux boundary condition was applied to a 20 cm long boundary directly below the dripper centred on 137 5 cm from the top left corner of the soil domain fig 3 the length of this boundary was selected to ensure that all irrigation water could infiltrate into the soil without producing positive surface pressure heads because positive pressure heads at the flux boundary could make the numerical code unstable šimůnek et al 2016 during irrigation the drip line boundary was held at a constant water flux q equal to the dripper discharge rates at different locations the atmospheric boundary condition was assumed for the remainder of the soil surface a no flow boundary condition was specified on the left and right edges of the soil profile to account for flow and transport symmetry a free drainage boundary condition was assumed at the bottom of the soil profile to implement a plastic cover over the mound treatment c arcs were constructed 3 5 cm below the surface boundary and a no flow boundary condition was imposed in the domain over the plastic sheet on both sides at the desired locations see fig 3 the extent of evaporation from the soil over the no flow mulched surface was assumed equal to the losses due to wear and tear of the mulch liu et al 2013 reported that plastic mulch reduced the soil evaporation by 90 under optimum conditions however year old mulch can deteriorate and be torn apart at some places leading to significant evaporation losses essentially placing the plastic mulch below a thin soil layer helped to protect it from the hot weather and other mid row operations pitt et al 2015 another advantage of adopting this approach was to facilitate rainwater movement along the ridge mound to the lower reaches of the furrow soil this approach further allowed simulating the variable impact of dynamic pressure heads due to rainfall on flow conditions in the soils similarly for treatment d a no flow boundary was embedded into the domain at the location 10 cm below the soil surface where the plastic sheet was placed in the field studies fine mesh size was adapted below the time variable flux boundary below the dripper in all treatments to facilitate dynamic flow conditions in response to frequent irrigations all specified boundary conditions are illustrated in fig 3 simulations were conducted separately for each treatment for three years july 1 2011 june 30 2014 using daily time steps for boundary conditions 2 3 estimation of potential transpiration tp and potential evaporation es hydrus 2d requires daily values of potential tp and es under the field conditions as inputs and then calculates modelled values depending on soil moisture dynamics in this study the fao 56 dual crop coefficient approach was employed to estimate the daily values of potential tp and es for grapevine at three locations allen et al 1998 this method has been used previously in many studies for input data generation e g phogat et al 2014 2017 it combines two coefficients i e a basal crop coefficient kcb responsible for transpiration and a soil evaporation coefficient ke i e kc kcb ke with daily reference crop evapotranspiration et 0 to estimate daily crop evapotranspiration etc as follows 1 e t c k cb k e e t 0 standard kcb values for grapevine were adjusted for the local climate taking into consideration crop height wind speed and minimum relative humidity averages for the period under consideration 2011 2014 at all locations allen et al 1998 location specific parameters used to estimate daily es and tp for grapevine following the fao 56 dual crop coefficient approach for three locations are given in table 3 values of daily potential transpiration tp and soil evaporation es obtained in this way were used as time variable boundary conditions see fig 3 in the hydrus 2d model along with precipitation received at the site during the study period more details about the fao 56 dual crop coefficient can be found in allen et al 1998 and allen and pereira 2009 2 4 solute parameters for salinity dynamics in the soil soil solution salinity ecsw distribution was modelled as a non reactive solute e g ramos et al 2011 wang et al 2014 phogat et al 2014 2019 these studies demonstrated that this approach could be successfully used in environments under intensive irrigation and fertigation management the longitudinal dispersivity was assumed as one tenth of the modelling domain with the transverse dispersivity being one tenth of the longitudinal dispersivity beven et al 1993 cote et al 2003 and the molecular diffusion coefficient of salts in water was considered as 1 656 cm2 day phogat et al 2017 the data for ec of irrigation water eciw was based on the water quality analysis however average values of eciw were considered for modelling for all locations mclaren vale 1 2 padthaway 2 2 and loxton 0 3 ds m as there was only a small variation in the irrigation water quality over the study period the rainfall chemistry analyzed by cresswell et al 2010 in the adelaide region estimated the salinity ecrw of 0 12 ds m and this value was used in simulations as a common value for all locations to facilitate the prediction of the leaching of salts from the soil profile all input eciw and ecrw values were converted into mass units using a common approximation 1 ec ds m 640 mg salts l the salt leaching efficiency was estimated to compare the effectiveness of various rainfall redirection techniques it was estimated for all locations annually as the amount of salts leached below a 1 m depth per volume of water drained the initial water content distribution was set to either measured values mclaren vale and padthaway or to field capacity loxton measured values of ece in the soil were converted to salinity at actual soil water content following a linear relationship by pitt et al 2015 and to salt mass as per the approximation 1 ec ds m 640 mg salts l 3 results and discussion 3 1 seasonal water balance seasonal water balance components for grapevine under different rainfall redirection treatments at the mclaren vale site are shown in table 4 the average water balance irrespective of seasons and treatments divided the transpiration tp evaporation es and drainage dr as 39 44 and 17 of the total water application respectively among the treatments the results were similar for the mid row mounding treatment b and the control a while tp increased slightly for buried plastic d relative to the control the mid row mound plastic c maximised vine water uptake followed by the buried plastic treatment the average increase in grapevine tp in the mid row mound plastic treatment was 16 higher than the control normally transpiration root water uptake are expected to increase for sites with plastic mulch as compared to no mulch sites allen et al 1998 because temperatures are higher under mulch and root growth is promoted gao et al 2014 saglam et al 2017 at the same time there was a drastic reduction 54 in es in the mid row mound plastic treatment which may have produced higher dr especially during the 2012 13 and 2013 14 seasons therefore the average seasonal dr in mid row mound plastic treatment increased three times compared to the other treatments moreover the average soil water storage δs also increased about four times under mid row mound plastic as compared to the control the water conservation effect of plastic mulch has been documented in many previous studies for drip irrigation e g saglam et al 2017 the average water balance components at padthaway were comparable to the mclaren vale site nonetheless the average soil water storage δs at the end of the grapevine season was 5 higher and the average es component was 7 lower than at the mclaren vale site table s 1 supplementary material similarly tp and dr also increased by 7 5 and 19 almost three times respectively when the control treatments were compared on the other hand at loxton rainfall redirection techniques had a little impact on vine water uptake as tp remained similar in all treatments table s 2 supplementary material however average tp accounted for 49 of the applied water while 26 of irrigation and rainfall contributed towards es with the remaining 25 of water draining out of the soil profile 1 m drainage dr almost doubled in the mid row mound plastic treatment c compared to the control a showing the impact of surface mulching on direct water loss from the soil surface leaching fractions lf estimated for the range of treatments at the three locations are shown in fig 4 the average lf for the mounding only b and buried plastic d treatments were similar to the control a however annual lfs were influenced by the site specific soil texture and climate conditions rainfall being higher at loxton 0 15 0 25 notably lfs were considerably lower at padthaway during 2011 12 due to a relatively dry soil profile at the start of the simulation compared to the other sites later on the lf at padthaway matched corresponding values at mclaren vale on the other hand the lf in the mid row mound plastic c treatment increased on average three times at mclaren vale 0 26 0 39 and padthaway 0 16 0 4 and two times at loxton 0 31 0 4 compared to the corresponding average values for other treatments hanson et al 2008 reported similar leaching fractions 0 07 0 31 under drip irrigation which encourages rapid localized leaching especially in light textured soils indeed treatment mid row mound plastic has emerged as the most favourable treatment with increased plant water uptake a higher fraction of the evaporative flux diverted towards leaching a substantial increase in the lf which altogether can help in maintaining a favourable environment by transporting salts out of the root zone these results further confirm that plastic mulching compared to the mid row mounding was an effective on farm water management strategy that can improve the rhizosphere environment for a long term sustainable grapevine production 3 2 soil salinity dynamics 3 2 1 spatiotemporal salinity distribution in the soil the impact of the rainfall redirection techniques on spatial salinity ece dynamics in the soil at the end of 2011 12 2012 13 and 2013 14 growing seasons at the three locations is shown in fig 5 generally the ece distribution at the mclaren vale and padthaway sites in the under vine uv was higher than in the mid row irrespective of the treatment because drip irrigation applies water close to the vines rapid water extraction due to the high root density in this region results in the deposition of salts on the other hand in the mid row reduced water uptake and little salt addition via irrigation coupled with adequate rainfall induced salt flushing produced lower ece however at mclaren vale a trend towards increasing ece occurred especially in the under vine at the end of successive seasons which is correlated with proportionally higher additions of salts through irrigation coupled with less localized leaching among the treatments the bigger ece bulge was present in the under vine in the control a and the mid row mound b treatments as compared to the mid row mound plastic c at the end of the 2013 14 season the maximum ece in the under vine region was 4 2 3 5 3 0 and 3 5 ds m respectively in the control a a mid row mound b a mid row mound plastic c and buried plastic d treatments at mclaren vale however salinity remained below 0 5 ds m in a mid row mound plastic c whereas it was 0 9 ds m in the control a and mid row mound b treatments and much higher in the buried plastic d 0 9 1 5 ds m the results showed that at mclaren vale the predominance of heavy textured heterogeneous soils and high irrigation water salinity encouraged salt deposition in the vicinity of the vine this situation is similar to the poorly drained soils which potentially encourage salinization and waterlogging problems in irrigated agro systems wichelns and qadir 2015 singh 2019 at padthaway the extent of ece distribution in the soil was much greater than at mclaren vale irrespective of regions and treatments because the initial salinity in the under vine 4 4 5 ds m and mid row 1 2 1 8 ds m regions was very high compared to the other two sites apparently the high eciw of the irrigation water 2 0 2 35 ds m coupled with medium to heavy textured soils with low hydraulic conductivity 11 26 cm day is conducive to salt deposition within the soil profile in the immediate vicinity of the vine under vine region where irrigation is applied through drippers therefore pockets of high ece 5 5 7 0 ds m at padthaway still existed under the vine below the 50 cm depth in all treatments except mid row mound plastic at the end of the 2011 12 vine growing season fig 5ii the maximum salinity zone had an average ece from 3 5 to 4 0 ds m at the end of 2013 14 however this zone spreads over a large area in the control a and mod row mound b treatments as compared to buried plastic d where it was restricted within a small region mostly in the deeper zone of the profile in mid row mound plastic c a significant volume of water passed through the zone of high salinity pushing the salts out of the profile consequently salinity was greatly reduced during the first season during the following seasons 2012 13 2013 14 the soil profile salinity was reduced below threshold 2 2 ds m in almost the entire mid row whereas pockets of higher salinity existed in the under vine below 30 cm hence treatment mid row mound plastic c continued to be by far the most effective at salt removal compared to the other treatments interestingly at loxton ece remained lower in the uv region as compared to mr irrespective of the rainfall redirection treatments fig 5iii at the end of the 3rd season 2013 14 a low ece zone 0 5 ds m increased laterally in all treatments the presence of sandy soils and a three times higher amount of irrigation water of eciw of 0 3 ds m applied within a localized region facilitated rapid leaching of the salts in contrast eciw at mclaren vale and padthaway was 4 and 7 times higher respectively than at loxton which potentially added an enormous quantity of salts in the soil in the under vine area in these drip irrigated vineyards ece in the soil profile always remained below the grapevine threshold 2 2 ds m in all treatments the buried plastic treatment allowed a small amount of salt deposition just below the plastic this is due to the plastic membrane blocking vertical drainage of water and promoting lateral salt migration to the area underneath the plastic in mid row mound plastic c the low salinity zone 0 5 ds m extended further under the vine compared to the other treatments it is also evident that most of the irrigation induced salts were leached out of the 1 m soil profile hence the current irrigation amount and quality of water did not pose any salinity threat in the root zone of the vine irrespective of treatments christen et al 2007 showed a similar impact on the salinity distribution when using good quality irrigation water in a loamy soil daily profile averaged ece in the under vine and mid row regions at the mclaren vale and padthaway sites are shown in fig 6 data for the loxton site is not shown as the salinity levels were much lower than the grapevine threshold ece of 2 2 ds m zhang et al 2002 a progressive increase in ece was found at mclaren vale in all treatments over the three seasons except in mid row mound plastic c where ece remained almost constant 0 5 ds m ece 0 9 ds m in buried plastic d was maximum in the mid row region at the end of the simulation despite increasing trends ece remained below the crop threshold in the mid row region in all treatments on the other hand it increased above the threshold in the under vine during the latter half of 2013 14 irrespective of treatments it seems that heavy textured soils with enormous profile heterogeneity and anisotropic flow conditions pitt et al 2015 have played a crucial role in nullifying the treatment impact at mclaren vale compared to the other padthaway at the padthaway site the average ece in the mr region remained below the threshold in all treatments except buried plastic d interestingly in this treatment ece under the mid row increased above the threshold during the 2013 14 growing season buried plastic possibly harboured more salts directly below the plastic layer due to the blockage of vertical drainage as was also seen at loxton also fig 5 however the average ece in the under vine reduced drastically in all treatments after an initial increase during the 2011 12 summers although it remained higher than the grapevine threshold 2 2 ds m the impact of the rainfall redirection was very dramatic in the mid row mound plastic c treatment where ece fell below the threshold during the post winter season of 2013 14 the mean ece in the buried plastic d treatment falls between values obtained in the control a and mid row mound plastic c treatments in the under vine area in other studies also mulching has been found to be a better field management option to reduce the upward movement of salts and evaporative water losses zhao et al 2014 chen et al 2016 and that mulching with different materials is a promising technique for salinity control in agriculture bezborodov et al 2010 abd el mageed et al 2016 the mid row mound plastic treatment c maintained relatively lower salinity within the vine root zone as compared to the other treatments especially for recycled water and groundwater irrigated grapevines with heavier textured soils providing a better growing environment for vine and a superior salt leaching approach as compared to other techniques the results of the modelling suggest that the treatments behaved differently at different locations and the impact on the ece distribution under grapevine due to rainfall redirection techniques depends on combined effects of the soil type water quality and weather conditions 3 3 seasonal salt balance salt balance dynamics in the soil under different rainfall redirection techniques is shown in table 5 there were different initial amounts of salts in the soils at different sites due to textural differences and the quantity and quality of water used for grape production at padthaway initial salt contents 8298 kg ha in the soil profile were 3 5 and 5 times higher than at mclaren vale and loxton respectively the annual amount of salts added through irrigation i s during the simulation period 2011 to 2014 varied from 631 to 1038 and from 900 to 1200 kg ha at the mclaren vale and loxton sites respectively however almost similar amounts of i s 3352 8 kg ha were added annually at padthaway during different years due to less variation in the seasonal irrigation volumes additionally the amount of salts added through the rain p s at mclaren vale 302 434 kg ha padthaway 308 408 kg ha and loxton 136 to 247 kg ha were much lower as compared to salts added through irrigation during the same period although salt additions in the soil in different treatments were similar salt storage δs s and leaching dr s altered due to different rainfall redirection techniques table 5 interestingly all treatments showed an increased amount of salt remaining in the profile at mclaren vale and padthaway except mid row mound plastic during all seasons where recycled water and groundwater were used for irrigation respectively on the other hand at loxton salt leaching was very rapid and a high amount of leaching occurred compared to the amount added through irrigation and rainfall table 5 therefore there was a net depletion of salts from the soil at the end of the 2013 14 season in all treatments similarly the average salts storage at padthaway in the mid row mound plastic c treatment was reduced by half as compared to the other treatments due to a rapid increase in the drainage flux which however was not sufficient to flush all salts out of the soil profile this suggests that soil texture and heterogeneity play an important role in the transient salt storage in the soil the average annual amount of salts leaching dr s in the control treatment a at each of the study sites remained almost similar to the mid row mounding b over the three seasons table 5 similarly the dynamics of daily salts leaching in these treatments a and b almost overlapped over the entire simulation period 2011 2014 at all locations except for slight deviations at loxton fig 6 this suggests that mid row mounding b had a small impact on salts leaching from the root zone irrespective of soil water and climate conditions however the mid row mound plastic c treatment resulted in more than twice the average salt mass removed 884 kg ha as compared to the control 406 kg ha at mclaren vale similarly the buried plastic d treatment also showed higher average salts leaching 563 kg ha than the control a at loxton although the average amount 4860 kg ha of salts leached dr s at padthaway in the mid row mound plastic treatment c was more than one and half times of the control a it was about five times the corresponding amount at mclaren vale it is estimated that about 14 6 t ha salts were leached during 2011 14 at padthaway in the mid row mound plastic treatment c which was 57 higher than for the control total salt leaching in other treatments ranged from 9 3 to 9 7 t ha the drastic increase in the salt leaching in the mid row mound plastic c treatment occurred due to the two pronged strategy of the redirection of rainfall and the reduction of evaporation losses due to the surface cover it can be seen that the drainage flux 6 7 ml ha in this treatment was more than double as compared to the other treatments 2 6 2 7 ml ha table 4 differences in daily salt leaching in different treatments and at different locations are also distinctly visible during the entire simulation period fig 6 high episodic salts leaching peaks occurred especially at the mclaren vale and padthaway sites whereas leaching was a continuous process in the sandy soil at loxton typically large peaks at all locations were preceded by high rainfall events and were also influenced by the amount of salts present in the soil notably at padthaway huge amounts of salts 3 35 t ha yr are added in the soils see table 5 through high salinity 2 2 2 35 ds m groundwater irrigation which are deposited in the soil and ready to be transported following large rainfall events generating large leaching fractions indeed the huge amount of salt leaching at padthaway irrespective of treatments may raise salinity concerns for shallow groundwater aquifers a groundwater monitoring study observed an increase in the salt contents by about 600 mg l in shallow aquifers from around 800 mg l to 1400 mg l in parts of padthaway during the last 25 years cleugh 2006 apparently excessive transport of irrigation induced root zone salts under grapevine may pose a potential danger for the groundwater quality hence a trade off exists between the extent of leaching and the imminent threat of groundwater degradation and judicious decisions are required for sustainable salinity management and controlling the pollution of groundwater 3 4 leaching efficiency and leaching requirement salt removal leaching efficiency les is defined as the ratio of the amount of salts leached from the soil profile and the corresponding amount added during a given time e g an annual or crop cycle which offers a more quantitative measure of the salt balance to compare different treatments lu et al 2019 at mclaren vale the les remained less than one irrespective of treatments and seasons indicating an overall tendency of salt deposition in the root zone fig 7 however les increased almost two fold in the mid row mound plastic c treatment compared to the control and mid row mounding and varied from 0 63 to 0 77 kg salts leached kg added interestingly at padthaway during 2011 12 les was very low average 0 12 0 13 kg leached kg salts added in all of the treatments besides mid row mound plastic 1 04 kg leached kg added in the later years of the simulation it reached a value larger than one 1 01 only under the mid row mounding during 2013 14 and the buried plastic 1 37 during 2012 13 however les remained above one in mid row mound plastic c during all seasons and reached a maximum value of 1 81 kg salts leached kg added during 2012 13 therefore only the mid row mound plastic c treatment showed continuous depletion of salts from the soil at padthaway the les remained larger than one at loxton irrespective of treatments and seasons indicating a strong depletion pattern however the mid row mound plastic c treatment had a maximum les value of 1 74 kg salts kg salts applied during 2011 12 hence the occurrence of les larger than one at loxton is attributed to the prevalence of highly permeable sandy soils low salinity of irrigation water 0 3 ds m and almost double amount of irrigation application than at the other sites which facilitated the rapid flushing of salts from the root zone in drip irrigated systems it is hard to determine the leaching requirement lr due to spatially variable soil wetting patterns that lead to localized leaching below the drip line hanson et al 2008 historically lr is the lf which when passed through the root zone reduces the root zone salts below the crop threshold hence in drip irrigation systems a lf that corresponds to les 1 can potentially leach annually added salts from the root zone it can serve as a good estimate for leaching of irrigation induced salts from the root zone hence a site specific relationship was developed between a seasonal lf and corresponding les at different locations irrespective of treatments fig 8 at lox sandy soils a very low lf 0 1 was found to rapidly attain les 1 while at padthaway medium textured soils the threshold lf was 0 18 the threshold lf for the mclaren vale site heavy textured heterogeneous soils was exceptionally high 0 74 which seems impractical however in the mid row mound plastic treatment c an average lf of 0 33 was able to flush 70 of added salts at mclaren vale thus showing promising results on the other hand this soil has restricted drainage conditions singh 2019 especially in the subsoils which may require different management options for salinity control overall the mid row mound covered with plastic c was the most efficient technique for leaching salt from the root zone and attaining les 1 especially at padthaway salt leaching results were extremely variable as influenced by soil texture and heterogeneity these techniques should be adopted cautiously depending on the soil climate and irrigation water quality at a particular location the main drawback of the plastic mulch is its cost its labour intensive application and environmental risk of plastic residues in the soil silin and xujian 2008 changrong et al 2014 these issues need due consideration before implementing the mounding with plastic strategy although biodegradable plastic mulching adhikari et al 2016 saglam et al 2017 chen et al 2019 2020 or sprayable biodegradable polymer membrane filipović et al 2020 are viable options for addressing the environmental issues other options of environmentally friendly mulching such as compost wood chips and plant residues are also available the application of organic mulches is equally labour intensive but they have numerous other beneficial impacts such as increasing soil water retention granatstein and mullinix 2008 yu et al 2018 and enhancing soil organic matter nutrient cycling and n availability neilsen et al 2003 sanchez et al 2003 hoagland et al 2008 teravest et al 2010 on the other hand they also have adverse impacts such as causing tree root diseases rodent infestation merwin and stiles 1994 and weed seed distribution rowley et al 2011 moreover their role in redirecting rainfall salts dynamics and leaching seems limited and not yet fully explored therefore the use of plastic mulches still seems to be a relatively better alternative if the overall goal is to reduce the soil salinization and leaching of soluble salts from the crop root zone 4 conclusions leaching of soluble salts from an irrigated soil root zone is necessary for sustainable crop production since all water additions and subsequent evaporation and transpiration will increase salt concentrations this investigation was carried out to understand the impact of different mid row management techniques such as mounding and plastic mulching for directing rainfall for reducing salt accumulation in the root zone of drip irrigated grapevines four different treatments no mounding or control a mid row mounding b mid row mounding covered with plastic c and plastic buried in the soil in the mid row d were evaluated using a numerical model hydrus 2d for simulating the water balance root zone salinity dynamics ece and salt dynamics in the soil for multiple seasons 2011 2014 in three grape growing regions these vines had been irrigated with varied water qualities ranging from river water 0 2 0 5 ds m at loxton recycled water 1 0 1 3 ds m at mclaren vale and groundwater 1 9 2 3 ds m at padthaway results demonstrated that mid row mounding with plastic mulching c was effective at controlling salinity under drip irrigated grapevines it showed a threefold increase in drainage flux dr a drastic reduction in evaporation es 48 54 and an increase in transpiration tp of grapevine 1 16 as compared to the control a despite such remarkable impacts of mid row mounding coupled with plastic mulch soil texture and the quantity and quality of irrigation water have played an important role in controlling salt transport in the soil modelling simulations confirmed that in heavy textured highly heterogeneous soils mclaren vale site in vineyards irrigated with recycled water eciw 1 2 ds m this treatment in spite of one and half times higher salts leaching than in the other treatments could not maintain a salt removal efficiency les 1 over the simulation period therefore the final average profile ece in the under vine uv region increased from 1 1 to 2 4 ds m which is more than the salinity tolerance threshold 2 2 ds m for grapevines groundwater irrigated eciw 2 2 2 35 ds m grapevines on medium textured soils padthaway site with double the irrigation amount compared to mclaren vale and a similar annual rainfall maintained les 1 during all three seasons reduced the average ece in the uv region from 5 2 to 3 2 ds m a leaching fraction of 0 18 was found to leach all annually added salts out of the root zone in the latter soils these results suggest that rainfall redirection techniques have the potential to play an important role in reducing root zone salts still the extent of the reduction will vary depending on the soil and agro climatic zone the requirement for salt removal from the soil is influenced by soil texture soil heterogeneity irrigation quantity and quality rainfall volume distribution and intensity and the salinity tolerance threshold of the cropland thus requires site specific modelling and management credit authorship contribution statement v phogat methodology software data curation formal analysis writing original draft t pitt

catchments the study projects precipitation p air temperature t potential evapotranspiration pet and discharge q in the entire catchment as well as groundwater level gwl variation in the lowland part of the catchment according to scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 projections of p and t are based on the results of a multimodel ensemble of seven regional climate models from the euro cordex project runoff is simulated by a calibrated hbv light model the correlation between gwl and river discharge was modeled by soft computing techniques of artificial neural networks ann the projections pertain to the period from 2021 to 2100 the mann kendall trend test is used to check for a trend and its statistical significance and the mann whitney test to examine the statistical significance of a change in the mean ensemble median of time series for the near future 2021 2050 and distant future 2071 2100 relative to the reference period 1971 2000 no notable changes are expected on an annual scale in the study area however the results show that the current non uniformity of the monthly water distribution is growing in the winter months at the end of the century in rcp8 5 p and t are expected to increase as is q groundwater responds to increased river discharges by reduced depths to groundwater increased gwl a higher q increases the flood risk in the winter months in the warm season rcp8 5 predicts a decrease in q and increase in the depth to groundwater in the distant future reduced quantities of water in the warm period might have an adverse effect on drinking water supply agriculture hydropower fisheries ecology and tourism in the study area keywords climate change hbv light model ann model surface water groundwater 1 introduction climate change is now evident increases in temperature at the end of the 21st century are projected throughout europe kovats et al 2014 the hydrologic cycle is expected to change accordingly and affect future availability of water resources on the other hand the demand for drinking water and industrial water will likely increase due to population growth as will the water demand for agriculture and hydropower harding et al 2014 as such it is extremely important to gain insight into the potential climate change impact on future water quantities the standard method for assessing the impact of climate change on the hydrologic regime involves the use of climate projections and hydrological modeling seiller et al 2012 climate projections are derived from global climate models gcms forced with different greenhouse gas ghg emission scenarios these projections are not adequate for regional research and require downscaling from global to regional scale regional climate models rcms reshmidevi et al 2018 representative concentration pathways rcp scenarios of ghg emissions adopted in the ipcc fifth assessment report which are mostly used in climate projections are rcp4 5 stabilization scenario and rcp8 5 constant increase scenario jacob et al 2014 vuković et al 2018 hydrological models forced with downscaled gcms data as inputs are widely applied to quantify the hydrologic impact of climate change rainfall runoff models are often used to model runoff they transform precipitation into runoff depending on the parameters selected to describe the catchment a conceptual model based on reservoir storage and simplified equations of physical hydrological processes are used in the present research as is a semi distributed conceptual model hbv hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning light bergström 1976 to simulate the runoff process in a catchment based on precipitation air temperature and potential evapotranspiration data bhattarai et al 2018 seibert and vis 2012 groundwater level gwl predictions have usually been made using physically based models which rely on mathematical equations to describe physical relationships tapoglou et al 2014 wunsch et al 2018 these are the most comprehensive groundwater models but they have many practical limitations because they are always data demanding zhang et al 2018 and many of these data are usually difficult to obtain jha and sahoo 2015 conversely artificial neural networks ann simply determine the system patterns based on the relationships between inputs and outputs mapped in the training process barzegar et al 2017 since the processes associated with groundwater in nature are highly complex ann are frequently used in groundwater modeling jha and sahoo 2015 wunsch et al 2018 many researchers have investigated the performance of ann models in gwl predictions chang et al 2015 djurovic et al 2015 jha and sahoo 2015 tapoglou et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 an ann model was used in the present research to predict gwl changes because it did not require accurate physical characterization of the study area in the west balkans there is a large number of small catchments that are physically similar they are generally in part mountainous which makes them sensitive to temperature variations and thus to potential climate change as well traditionally these mountainous regions are underdeveloped they are generally rural with farming established in lowland parts of river catchments for many people living in these areas agriculture is the primary activity and sole source of income any reduction in agricultural production threatens their livelihood it is therefore very important to asses how climate change will affect water resources in rural areas in the future a potential decrease in the quantity of water resources would not only hinder and reduce agricultural production but also affect already lackluster socioeconomic circumstances lead to further deterioration of the living conditions of the rural population and likely boost migration or result in increasing poverty the development of water conservation strategies requires projections of surface water and groundwater availability in mountainous regions in the near and distant future as such they are also required for decision making with regard to the selection and implementation of climate change adaptation measures aimed at maintaining agricultural production in rural mountainous regions of the west balkans a representative catchment of the toplica river in an underdeveloped region of serbia was selected for the case study past studies associated with these areas included only assessments of climate change impact on surface water resources ivković and kržič 2017 langsholt et al 2013 todorović and plavšić 2015 available literature sources report little research on the impact of climate change on groundwater in west balkans the aim of the study was to complement past research and add to general insight into the potential climate change impact on water availability in mountainous catchments the specific objectives of the study were to 1 detect temporal trends of temperature potential evapotranspiration precipitation runoff in the entiretoplica river catchment and groundwater in the lowland part of the catchment 2 quantify their projected changes in the near and distant future per two emission scenarios and 3 analyze mutual relationships between these variables in order to clarify the impact of climate change on water resources the research conclusion would be applicable to all catchments with similar climate conditions and similar physical and geographical characteristics another important contribution of the study is the proposed methodology that effectively combines a soft computing technique and conceptual model as it represents a sound numerical framework for modeling of hydrological correlations along with climate models it provides predictions for the near and distant future 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the study area is the catchment of the toplica river a left tributary of the južna morava in serbia fig 1 river discharge was analyzed up to the gauging station at doljevac fig 2 corresponding to a catchment area of 2052 km2 the catchment of the toplica river is located between latitudes 42 62 and 43 24 n and longitudes 20 45 and 21 54 e the elevations range from 190 to 2016 m the climate is humid and semi humid the weighed annual average precipitation is 635 mm for the period from 1971 to 2000 for the same period the weighted annual average potential evapotranspiration is 811 mm the mean discharge recorded by the gauging station at doljevac is 9 21 m3 s 1971 2000 the national hydrometeorological service of serbia monitors water table fluctuations at eight observation wells in the lowland part of the toplica catchment these observation wells were installed in july 1988 at distances of 10 to 520 m from the riverbank they are 6 3 to 10 m deep observations are generally made once in ten days most of the observation wells have been intermittently in and out of service observation well 3 540 fig 2 was selected for modeling because of a monitoring data gap of only one month the thickness of the aquifer ceiling at this observation well is 1 6 m and that of the aquifer 5 6 m the average depth to groundwater gwd is 2 9 m 2 2 data the case study used both observed and projected hydro meteorological data the recorded hydrological data including daily discharges and river stages at the doljevac station 1961 2010 and monthly water table data from eight observation wells 1988 2016 were made available by the national hydrometeorological service of serbia http www hidmet gov rs daily data on precipitation p and air temperature tmax tmin and tmean were collected from weather stations in the cities of niš kuršumlija and prokuplje and on mt kopaonik nhss http www hidmet gov rs the locations of the stations in the catchment are shown in fig 2 given that the weather parameters recorded by these stations did not have the same effect across the study area the values were weighted by the thiessen polygon method to derive representative values for the entire catchment daily potential evapotranspiration pet was calculated based on daily temperatures from the above mentioned weather stations and then weighted applying the thiessen polygon method previous investigations have shown that pet formulas based on temperature tend to provide good discharge simulation oudin et al 2005 the temperature based modified hargreaves approach was used the hargreaves

day 1 3 methodology the applied methodology is schematically represented in fig 3 3 1 climate projections precipitation and temperatures at the four selected weather stations fig 2 were projected using the results of seven regional climate models from the euro cordex project table 1 the resolution was 12 5 km the projections pertain to daily values for the period 2021 2100 the simulations were based on representative concentration pathways rcps scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 rcp scenarios assume pathways to different target radiative forcing at the end of the 21st century scenario rcp4 5 supposes an increase in radiative forcing of 4 5 w m2 by the end of the century whereas scenario rcp8 5 assumes 8 5 w m2 relative to pre industrial conditions moss et al 2010 a high resolution ensemble of regional climate models was developed for europe within the scope of the world climate research program coordinated regional downscaling experiment euro cordex project http www euro cordex net euro cordex gathered together simulations of regional climate models generated by downscaling global climate models from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 jacob et al 2014 the climate parameters minimum maximum and mean air temperature and precipitation projected using the seven rcms were statistically corrected by quantile mapping this is a standard method for eliminating the bias inherent in all numerical models cumulative probability density functions cdf of daily climate observations were compared to the models output at the closest model point for the reference period 1971 2000 under the assumption that daily temperature data follows the gaussian dettinger et al 2004 and precipitation data without dry days the two parameter gamma distribution piani et al 2010 the number of dry days was corrected by equating the observed and modeled dry days wood et al 2004 if a model produced more dry days than observed randomly selected days were wetted with minimal precipitation if the number of dry days was smaller than observed randomly chosen drizzle days were artificially dried corrective functions that transfer modeled to observed values were developed for every climate parameter each model and every month after matching modeled to observed cdfs the corrective functions were applied to the models results for the reference and both future periods a high level of uncertainty is associated with climate projections the multimodel approach balances out different model concepts and objectives and thus reduces the bias and provides more reliable results than the single model method seiller et al 2012 the multimodel ensemble climate simulations which was selected for the present research has been used in many other studies e g refsgaard et al 2016 reshmidevi et al 2018 shen et al 2018 3 2 hydrological projections 3 2 1 runoff runoff from the catchment namely discharge q at the doljevac gauging station was simulated using a calibrated hbv light model seibert and vis 2012 the projections of future daily discharges by that model are based on the entry of weighted from four weather stations projected daily climate input data the p and t projections are a result of seven climate models and two scenarios each pet was calculated eq 1 on the basis of the projected t these 14 datasets for q constitute the hydrological projection of runoff as impacted by climate change from 2021 to 2100 the hbv light model is founded upon the conceptual hbv model bergström 1976 and is commonly used inter alia for climate change studies bhattarai et al 2018 etter et al 2017 langsholt et al 2013 seiller et al 2012 the hbv light model is a semi distributed hydrological model comprised of several modules the snow routine the soil routine the response or groundwater routine and the routing routine the snow routine calculates snow accumulation and snow melt by the degree day method at temperatures below a threshold value all precipitation is considered to be snow in the soil and groundwater routines groundwater recharge actual evapotranspiration and runoff are simulated as functions of water storage total runoff is transformed by a triangular weighting function in the routing routine as altitude increases the model adjusts daily precipitation totals and mean daily temperatures through a linear increase 100 m and linear decrease c 100 m respectively a more detailed description of the hbv light model and the governing equations as calibration parameters are provided in the literature seibert and vis 2012 the catchment was modeled with 10 elevation zones and two vegetation zones each farmland and forest a digital elevation model dem of the terrain was downloaded from https gdex cr usgs gov gdex and vegetation distribution data from the website of the copernicus land monitoring service corine land cover https land copernicus eu pan european corine land cover clc 2012 the hbv light model was calibrated against the daily discharges observed at the doljevac gauging station along with daily precipitation mean daily temperatures and calculated pet prepared by weighing data from the four weather stations fig 2 all simulations pertained to the hydrologic year 1 october to 30 september and a warm up period preceded each simulation the calibration period was selected following a review of the climate conditions from 1961 to 2010 series of consecutive average wet years were selected by the moving average method and the calibration was based on them using the gap algorithm genetic algorithm and powell s method comprised of a genetic algorithm for regional optimization and an algorithm for local optimization of that region powell s method seibert 2000 the model was calibrated

sample test dss test klemeš 1986 seiller et al 2012 validation periods did not overlap with the model calibration period 3 2 2 groundwater levels a soft computing artificial neural network ann model was used to predict groundwater levels one month in advance the ann approach can be followed to model correlations among certain physical quantities and the variable whose value needs to be predicted neural networks comprise multiple interconnected layers the layer that receives input signals is called the input layer and it generally only buffers the input signal the input layer contains the values of the physical quantities that affect the variable that is to be predicted the output from the network is generated by the output layer all layers between the input layer and the output layer are called hidden layers because they are within the network and have no direct contact with the external environment an ann can have zero to several hidden layers a feedforward network with one hidden layer fig 4 was set up for the present research as it yields sound groundwater level predictions bowden et al 2005 coulibaly et al 2000 kumar et al 2016 rakhshandehroo et al 2012 ann was used to model the correlation between gwl in the lowland part of the catchment and the discharge of the toplica river observation well 3 540 whose location is shown in fig 2 was selected as representative for depicting gwl the starting point for determining the input variables was a priori knowledge about the physical processes to be modeled some researchers bowden et al 2005 kumar et al 2016 have applied analytical techniques like cross correlation and autocorrelation to establish a linear correlation between variables the present study used the correlation analysis taking the physical quantities whose future projections were available and which were assumed based on experience to potentially affect groundwater levels gwl in the preceding period q of the toplica river p pet and air t all the parameters were expressed on a monthly basis for the period from july 1988 to december 2016 making up a time series of 342 data points the output layer had only one variable monthly gwl at the observation well trial and error best showed that the activation function for the hidden layer was a tansig and for the output layer a purelin function the number of nodes in the hidden layer was also determined by trial and error it was varied from 3 to 6 and the mean squared error mse was calculated the conclusion was that as the number of nodes in the hidden layer increased the quality criteria slightly improved decreased but the structure of the network and the number of parameters to be adjusted increased considerably as such it was decided that three nodes in the hidden layer was a sound tradeoff between modeling quality and network training complexity three hidden nodes are also suggested in the literature coulibaly et al 2001 daliakopoulos et al 2005 djurovic et al 2015 tsanis et al 2008 the levenberg marquardt lm method jha and sahoo 2015 wunsch et al 2018 of error back propagation was used for ann training the end of training required one of the following three conditions maximum number of iterations 1000 was selected prediction error threshold 0 01 was selected or variation of the mse criterion for the validation test if the mse criterion increased in six consecutive epochs training was discontinued this condition was imposed to prevent a data overfitting ann the ann model prepared in this manner predicted gwl from 2021 to 2100 using projected values of q by the hbv light model based on projected values of p tmean and pet climate models 3 3 data analysis climate change was examined over the period from 2021 to 2100 on an annual and monthly time scale relative to the reference period 1971 2000 to eliminate the climate and hydrological model bias the simulated future values were compared to the simulated values in the reference period rather than gauged values shen et al 2018 changes were assessed following the multimodel approach to reduce climate model uncertainties the multimodel ensemble comprised seven climate models for each rcp scenario the medians of the time series were used in order to mitigate the effect of outliers believed to become more frequent in the future a change in the median of tmean was expressed as an absolute value in c whereas those of pet p q and gwd were shown as relative values in eq 6 6 δ medianx sim f u t medianx sim r e f medianx sim r e f 100 where δ is the projected difference of the median x is the simulated value of pet p q or gwd in the reference period and future period the temporal variation in the mean ensemble median differences was expressed through 51 future 29

checked the distribution of the time series of hydrometeorological variables whose trend was examined in the present study was checked by the kolmogorov smirnov and shapiro wilk normality tests razali and wah 2011 p 0 05 the finding was that the time series did not fulfill the criteria for parametric tests non parametric methods mann kendall s trend test mk and sen s slope estimator were used to determine the trend and its statistical significance in the time series mondal et al 2012 mk test data need not conform to any particular distribution and that is why this test is often used to quantify the statistical significance of trends in hydrometeorological time series mondal et al 2012 shen et al 2018 tabari et al 2011 the mk test requires the time series to be serially independent to avoid the effect of autocorrelation in the time series on the statistical significance of the trend the original time series was pre whitened before applying the mk test mondal et al 2012 autocorrelation in the time series was established using the r based software package acf which is freely available from the web site https www rdocumentation org packages forecast versions 8 4 topics acf the r based software package modified mkv1 1 0 https www rdocumentation org packages modifiedmk versions 1 1 0 was used to determine the magnitude of the trend and slope this software tests the serial correlation and the applied pre whitening technique performs the mk test at a significance cutoff level of p 0 05 and computes sen s slope parameter on the basis of which the slope of the trend is estimated the statistical significance of the projected changes in the annual and monthly values of p tmean pet q and gwd were assessed by mann whitney s mw test mann and whitney 1947 at a significance cutoff level of p 0 05 the mw test is a non parametric rank based test for assessing the statistical significance of the difference in the median or mean of two time series which is commonly used to test hydrological time series reshmidevi et al 2018 the test is based on the null hypothesis that the medians of two compared time series are the same as opposed to the alternative hypothesis that there is a statistically significant difference the mw test was applied to check the statistical significance of the change in the mean ensemble median of the time series in the near 2035s and distant 2085 s future relative to the reference period 1971 2000 4 results and discussion 4 1 calibration and validation the hbv light model used to project discharges at the end of the century was calibrated prior to application since both wet and dry years are expected in the future the model was calibrated against an average wet period to equally simulate both extreme climate conditions for the 1961 2010 period the moving average method was applied and 13 average wet periods were identified their lengths were from 5 to 12 years each of these 13 periods was gap optimized and each comprised 10 000 model runs and 1000 runs for local optimization powell s method as a result 13 times 10 of the best sets according to the of criterion were identified based on the achieved values of of nse nselogq and ve and the deviation of the monthly discharge distribution from that of the reference period 1971 2000 one of the ten best sets of parameters for the period 1994 1999 was selected for the calibration the efficiency criterion values for this calibration period were of 0 83 nse 0 76 nselogq 0 82 and ve 1 the model calibrated in this way was validated against various climate conditions to test its applicability to warm cold wet and dry years the moving average method was applied to select the warm cold dry and wet validation periods 19 from 1961 to 2010 the nse based on which the fit of simulated and observed values was assessed was greater than 0 6 in order to apply the ann model which was used to project gwl correlation analysis was used to check the strength of the correlation among gwl at the observation wells and different climate and hydrological parameters table 2 observation well 3 540 was deemed representative and selected for modeling it provided regular readings except for one month and exhibited a statistically significant correlation between gwl fluctuations on its location and fluctuations at the remaining seven observation wells where r 0 71 0 88 p 0 01 the results presented in table 2 show a statistically significant positive correlation r 0 87 p 0 01 between gwl and the tested hydrological parameters river stage and discharge in the specific case the climate parameters on a monthly basis exhibited no statistically significant correlation with gwl this was the reason for opting for a simple neural network for which the input data included the discharges of the toplica river in month t q t and groundwater level at observation well 3 540 in month t 1 gwl t 1 the output from the neural network was gwl in the observed month t or gwl t fig 5 shows the measured and simulated values of gwl from 1988 to 2016 the simulation dataset was divided into three groups 70 of the data from the available time series was used for training 15 was used for validation and 15 was reserved for testing the correlation coefficient of the measured and simulated data from each group training validation and testing was in the interval from 0 92323 to 0 96536 and of the entire dataset 0 9309 fig 6 discharges q t projected by hbv light and groundwater levels in the preceding month gwl t 1 generated by the ann model were used to predict future groundwater levels gwl t 4 2 climate change projections 4 2 1 projected changes in temperature ipcc projections suggest considerable global warming through to the end of 2100 kovats et al 2014 le treut et al 2007 this was corroborated by the present research the upward trend of the absolute change in the median of annual tmean in both scenarios was found to be statistically significant according to the mann kendall test p 0 05 mk p 0 05 the projected increase is 0 02 c year and 0 05 c year for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively the projections for rcp8 5 exhibited a statistically significant positive trend mk p 0 05 for all months as well the slopes ranged from 0 04 c year to 0 07 c year the mann whitney test p 0 05 mw p 0 05 showed a statistically significant temperature increase on each of the tested timescales annual and monthly according to scenario rcp4 5 by the end of the century the increase in the median of annual tmean will be 2 c relative to the reference period and according to rcp8 5 more than double 4 2 c fig 7 a fig 7 b and c shows the results of the mann whitney test p 0 05 by month with significant differences fill marked the predicted increases in tmean by month were in the interval from 0 6 c to 2 6 c in rcp4 5 and as much as 1 1 c to 5 1 c in rcp8 5 for the generally warmest months july and august the increase in the median of tmean is expected to be the largest from approximately 2 5 c for rcp4 5 to 5 c for rcp8 5 at the end of the century winter temperatures are also expected to increase by 3 3 c 4 8 c at the end of the century in the rcp8 5 scenario fig 7 c previous research in serbia has reported an increasing temperature trend in the past ruml et al 2017 this will continue to be the case in the future as corroborated by the present study other studies that address future climate change parameters in serbia e g vuković et al 2018 report the same temperature increases at the beginning and end of the century in both scenarios as the present research most studies worldwide agree with the projected temperature increase during the 21st century kovats et al 2014 lobanova et al 2018 papadimitriou et al 2016 reshmidevi et al 2018 shen et al 2018 4 2 2 projected changes in potential evapotranspiration potential evapotranspiration pet has direct implications on the sustainability of surface and subsurface water resources green et al 2011 pan et al 2015 so a pet projection analysis is provided below pet was calculated by the modified hargreaves temperature based method since the analysis is based on temperature projections showing a considerable upward trend towards the end of the century an increase in pet is expected as well green et al 2011 in rcp8 5 the predicted relative change in the median of annual pet was statistically significant mk p 0 05 and indicated an increase of 0 16 year for the same scenario the mk trend test p 0 05 showed a statistically significant upward trend of monthly pet for all months as well as of tmean whereas scenario rcp4 5 suggested a statistically significant upward trend only from february to may the mw test p 0 05 of the median of pet indicated a statistically significant increase on an annual and monthly scale except in october and april according to rcp4 5 fig 8 a at the end of the century in rcp8 5 the projection indicated twice as much potential annual evapotranspiration 14 5 compared to rcp4 5 7 1 a comparison of monthly variability of the median of monthly pet for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 showed considerably larger differences between the near and distant future in rcp8 5 the highest percent increase of 32 4 is expected in january at the end of the century according to rcp8 5 fig 8 b in the same scenario the increase in potential evapotranspiration in august was percentually smaller 14 6 but the increase in absolute values was 3 5 times greater than in january the highest temperatures and the largest water deficit will likely occur in summer the resulting increase in pet towards the end of century is consistent with the findings of researchers in other parts of the world green et al 2011 kovats et al 2014 pan et al 2015 reshmidevi et al 2018 4 2 3 projected changes in precipitation precipitation p is an important component of the hydrologic cycle because it affects runoff and groundwater green et al 2011 singh and kumar 2010 precipitation projections were analyzed on different time scales annual and monthly although the mk test p 0 05 showed no statistically significant trend in the annual data the mw test p 0 05 indicated a statistically significant increase in the median of annual p of 7 2 compared to the reference period in scenario rcp8 5 in the distant future relative differences in the median of p between the near and distant future on both time scales and their statistical significance according to the mw test p 0 05 are shown in table 3 the results of the analysis of monthly data were divided into the warm half year from april to september warm season and the cold half year from october to march cold season fig 9 indicates the deviation of the median of p from that in the reference period shown for 51 future 29 year periods time slices and two different rcp scenarios separately for the warm and cold season according to rcp4 5 a decrease in the median of p is projected for the warm season except for the months of april and may fig 9 a in the case of rcp8 5 fig 9 b shows that the decreases in most of the future periods are related to the warmest part of the year june july and august with august being the leading month in this regard the mw test p 0 05 corroborated that the decrease in august by as much as 35 at the end of the century in rcp8 5 was statistically significant the mk test p 0 05 of the warm season months indicated a statistically significant trend of the relative differences in the median of p only for the month of june rcp8 5 with a decrease of 0 04 year an increase in the median of p is expected in the entire cold season and all future periods except in december for which a decrease is expected in some time slices fig 9 c and d for that season the test mk p 0 05 did not reveal a statistically significant trend for any of the months the change in the median of p in 2035 s and 2085 s relative to the reference period based on the mw test p 0 05 was statistically significant for several months table 3 the largest increase of 38 was in march in the near future and 35 in february in the distant future rcp4 5 in the case of rcp8 5 the largest statistically significant increase in the median of p was 30 in march in the distant future in the past there has been a generally upward precipitation trend in serbia ruml et al 2016 but a downward trend in the summer months in central and southern serbia where the catchment of the toplica river is located vuković et al 2018 the future projections of p in the present research are consistent with the projections derived for the same two rcp scenarios of future ghg emissions in serbia vuković et al 2018 the same projected decrease in precipitation in the summer months and increase in the cold season has also been reported for the part of europe that includes serbia havril et al 2018 kovats et al 2014 lobanova et al 2018 4 3 impact of climate change on hydrological variables 4 3 1 projected changes in discharge kovačević majkić and urošev 2014 reported no statistically significant change in annual discharge q at the doljevac gauging station from 1961 to 2010 and no statistically significant trend of monthly q during the same period the present research also found no statistically significant trend mk p 0 05 in the projected change in the median of annual q the mw test p 0 05 did not predict statistically significant changes in the median of annual q in the near and distant future in both scenarios table 3 the relative difference in the median of q in the near and distant future on both time scales and its statistical significance according to the mw test p 0 05 are shown in table 3 it is apparent that the number of months with a statistically significant change in the median of q in rcp4 5 was greater 5 months in the near future than in the distant future 3 months however rcp8 5 showed the opposite with as many as six months in the distant future the largest predicted percent changes in both the near and distant future were associated with august and september in the warm season and january in the cold season these changes were also statistically significant except in the near future in rcp8 5 with regard to monthly q the mk test p 0 05 showed a statistically significant downward trend only for may of 0 38 year in rcp8 5 the warm season was characterized by a lower median of q relative to the reference period in all future periods for three and four months in rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively fig 10 a and b the largest decrease in the median of q was in august and september the change in the median of q in summer and early autumn was larger in 2085 s than 2035 s in both scenarios and the peak q in spring decreased and shifted towards winter particularly in rcp8 5 at the end of the century this variation in q is consistent with the findings of schneider et al 2013 the median of q is expected to increase in the entire cold season except for the month of october in both scenarios fig 10 c and d the difference between october and the other months of the cold season suggests a longer warm season which is consistent with the results for central and eastern europe papadimitriou et al 2016 in addition an increase in q during winter and in late autumn is indicated by research in connection with the danube river basin lobanova et al 2018 the toplica river falls within that basin past research predicts a decrease in q on an annual scale in the toplica catchment langsholt et al 2013 todorović and plavšić 2015 the forecasts are based on climate parameters resulting from previous projections according to ipcc sres scenarios a2 and a1b nakicenovic et al 2000 where annual p is expected to decrease 4 3 2 projected changes in groundwater level on an annual scale no statistically significant trend was noted in the median of the depth to groundwater gwd mk p 0 05 the mw test p 0 05 also showed no statistically significant variation in the median of gwd at this scale in either the near or distant future table 3 shows the relative difference in the median of gwd in the near and distant future on all time scales as well as its statistical significance according to the mw test p 0 05 in the warm season there is a statistically significant positive gwd trend declining gwl mk p 0 05 in may 0 04 year in rcp4 5 and in rcp8 5 in july 0 03 year and august 0 02 year in the cold season there is a statistically significant positive gwd trend mk p 0 05 in january 0 01 year in rcp4 5 and in november 0 03 year in rcp8 5 although mw p 0 05 predicts minor changes in the median of gwd in both the warm and cold season in the interval from 4 6 to 2 6 these changes are statistically significant for a large number of months of these months in the near and distant future in both scenarios 44 showed a statistically significant change table 3 the warm season in the 51 future periods is characterized by an increase in gwd lowering of the water table relative to the reference period except for the months of april and may as well as june in the first half of the 21st century rcp4 5 fig 11 a in rcp8 5 an increase in gwd is projected for all months except for april where there was a partial increase and partial decrease in gwd fig 11 b fig 11 c shows that a decrease in gwd increase in gwl was projected for all time slices of the cold season rcp4 5 and all months except for october in rcp8 5 the increase in gwd apart from october also generally included the month of november fig 11 d the extended increase in gwd might be indicative of a longer dry period as in the case of q due to warming and a higher rate of evapotranspiration kovats et al 2014 the predicted decrease in gwd in the future in the cold season and increase in the warm season is consistent with the ipcc technical paper bates et al 2008 such changes would boost the seasonality of the hydrologic regime a possibility pointed out by taylor et al 2013 4 4 analysis of relationships among and between climatic and hydrologic variables on an annual scale the mk test p 0 05 showed no statistically significant trend for p q and gwd in either scenario a statistically significant upward trend in both scenarios is expected for tmean as well as pet but only in rcp8 5 compared to the reference period at the end of the century statistically significant mw p 0 05 increases in annual p 7 2 and annual pet 14 5 were predicted in rcp8 5 these increases together will result in an annual increase in q of only 2 and an increase in gwd of as little as 0 7 which were not recognized as statistically significant by the mw test p 0 05 consequently on the annual scale no notable changes are expected in the availability of water in the study area for the study period 2021 2100 the mk test p 0 05 showed a statistically significant upward trend of pet for all months but only in rcp8 5 under the same conditions a statistically significant trend of p q and gwd was predicted for only a few months one for p and q and three for gwd the mw test p 0 05 identified the months in which changes in p q and gwd were all statistically significant in 2035 s rcp4 5 these were march and july at the end of the century 2085 s the months in both scenarios were january and august joined by december in rcp8 5 the quantity of water is expected to increase in these cold season months and decrease in summer this suggests a more pronounced non uniformity of the monthly distribution the catchment of the toplica river is in part rainfall dominated the remaining mountainous area is snowmelt dominated characterized by an abundance of water in spring due to snow melt and spring rains the variation in p due to climate change will largely affect the rainfall dominated part of the catchment whereas the increase in t will have an impact on higher elevations with more snow cover at the end of the century in rcp8 5 due to the expected increase in p and t in winter q will likely increase considerably 29 50 during the period from november to february this increase might be due to the increase in p as well as p partly being in the form of rain rather than snow the response of groundwater in shallow aquifers to this change in q will be a small decrease in the depth to groundwater increase in groundwater level the winter increase in q will also increase the flood risk during that period in the reference period the toplica river recorded the highest discharges in march and april the effect of warming was assessed by comparing projections for march in the near and distant future in rcp8 5 in the near future due to the increase in p 14 7 tmean 2 c and pet 9 q is expected to increase by 17 3 and gwd to decrease groundwater level to increase by 3 in the distant future double the increase in p 29 5 will decrease q and gwd by only 0 4 because of the double increase in tmean 4 5 c and pet 20 this suggests that at the end of the century q will peak before march as a result of the projected warming a positive aspect of the decrease in spring q when q is generally the highest will be a reduced flood risk the projections for the warm season showed a decrease in p and increase in tmean and pet such conditions will increase the irrigation demand towards the end of the century the monthly q variability of the toplica river showed the lowest discharges from august to october distant future predictions suggested that the summer decrease in p in august by as much as 34 5 statistically significant and the statistically significant increase in pet will result in a large percent decrease in q august 29 september 42 and october 43 4 the decrease in september and october mw p 0 05 was also statistically significant a statistically significant increase in gwd was projected from july to october 2 1 to 2 5 q is expected to decrease and gwd to increase in eight months of the year which will extend the period of low water availability reduced water availability in the warm period might have an adverse effect on agriculture because that period coincides with the growing season of a large number of crops smaller quantities and higher temperatures of river water will have an adverse effect on water quality this might threaten the aquatic ecosystem and reduce available amounts of high quality water the problem is of a global nature in regions where reduced water quantities are projected van vliet et al 2013 the present study along with many others corroborates that climate change will alter the hydrologic cycle and thus the hydrologic regime of any given area donnelly et al 2017 green et al 2011 schneider et al 2013 4 5 uncertainty of projection the study did not take into account potential changes due to anthropogenic factors which are of course unavoidable but beyond the scope of this research as others have pointed out all these predictions primarily depend on the selection of climate models reshmidevi et al 2018 as they bring about the largest uncertainty karlsson et al 2016 refsgaard et al 2016 shen et al 2018 additional influence comes from hydrological and groundwater modeling gädeke et al 2014 singh and kumar 2010 in order to minimize uncertainty an ensemble of seven rcms were used in the present study to derive climate projections the use of an ensemble of hydrological models may help reduce the uncertainty inherent in hydrological models reshmidevi et al 2018 this uncertainty is also affected by the selection of the calibration period todorovic and plavsic 2016 as such climate conditions were analyzed in the present study to determine the calibration and validation periods in general the uncertainties inherent in hydrological impact modeling can be reduced by collecting high quality data refsgaard et al 2016 an insufficiently developed network of observation wells is a special limiting factor in the assessment of groundwater response to climate change 5 conclusion based on the reported case study of the toplica river according to scenario rcp8 5 no notable water quantity variations on an annual scale are expected through to the end of the century however there will likely be more prominent changes on a monthly scale relative to the current distribution as a result of the projected warming peak q is expected to decrease and occur earlier before march in spring when q is the highest the flood risk is expected to be lower in general the quantity of water will likely increase in winter and decrease in summer both q and gwl are expected to decline during eight months of the year meaning that the period of reduced water supply will be longer the projected decrease in p q and gwl in summer when the study area experiences a water deficit even at present might have multiple adverse effects on agriculture water supply hydropower fisheries the river ecosystem and tourism at the end of the century scenario rcp 4 5 shows less pronounced changes in hydrologic variables than scenario rcp 8 5 the above conclusions are applicable to the development of strategic adaptation plans in agriculture and other sectors that rely on water not only in the study area but also other areas with similar climate conditions and comparable physical and geographic characteristics of which there are many in the west balkans a particular contribution of the study relates to the fact that this is an initial study in the region where groundwater level projections were made insight into the trend is extremely important because groundwater is the primary source of water supply for irrigation as well as other segments of water use another contribution of this study is the proposed methodology which effectively combines a soft computing technique and conceptual model with climate models and is applicable to other catchments the inclusion of an ann model which does not require knowledge of the geology of the area is of particular importance this is a significant advantage especially in underdeveloped countries where detailed geological investigations have not been undertaken due to funding issues methodologies that include modeling also involve the uncertainty of each model the issue of uncertainties inherent in climate modeling could be addressed by involving an even larger number of climate models to arrive at more realistic climate projections an ensemble of hydrological models and high quality input data might help reduce the uncertainty of hydrological modeling the next step would be the inclusion of crop models in the research with a view to recommending the most suitable crops for the projected climate conditions and water availability declaration of competing interest

5429,the catchment of the toplica river situated in an underdeveloped region of southern serbia is studied to examine the potential impact of climate change on the hydrologic regime of mountainous catchments the study projects precipitation p air temperature t potential evapotranspiration pet and discharge q in the entire catchment as well as groundwater level gwl variation in the lowland part of the catchment according to scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 projections of p and t are based on the results of a multimodel ensemble of seven regional climate models from the euro cordex project runoff is simulated by a calibrated hbv light model the correlation between gwl and river discharge was modeled by soft computing techniques of artificial neural networks ann the projections pertain to the period from 2021 to 2100 the mann kendall trend test is used to check for a trend and its statistical significance and the mann whitney test to examine the statistical significance of a change in the mean ensemble median of time series for the near future 2021 2050 and distant future 2071 2100 relative to the reference period 1971 2000 no notable changes are expected on an annual scale in the study area however the results show that the current non uniformity of the monthly water distribution is growing in the winter months at the end of the century in rcp8 5 p and t are expected to increase as is q groundwater responds to increased river discharges by reduced depths to groundwater increased gwl a higher q increases the flood risk in the winter months in the warm season rcp8 5 predicts a decrease in q and increase in the depth to groundwater in the distant future reduced quantities of water in the warm period might have an adverse effect on drinking water supply agriculture hydropower fisheries ecology and tourism in the study area keywords climate change hbv light model ann model surface water groundwater 1 introduction climate change is now evident increases in temperature at the end of the 21st century are projected throughout europe kovats et al 2014 the hydrologic cycle is expected to change accordingly and affect future availability of water resources on the other hand the demand for drinking water and industrial water will likely increase due to population growth as will the water demand for agriculture and hydropower harding et al 2014 as such it is extremely important to gain insight into the potential climate change impact on future water quantities the standard method for assessing the impact of climate change on the hydrologic regime involves the use of climate projections and hydrological modeling seiller et al 2012 climate projections are derived from global climate models gcms forced with different greenhouse gas ghg emission scenarios these projections are not adequate for regional research and require downscaling from global to regional scale regional climate models rcms reshmidevi et al 2018 representative concentration pathways rcp scenarios of ghg emissions adopted in the ipcc fifth assessment report which are mostly used in climate projections are rcp4 5 stabilization scenario and rcp8 5 constant increase scenario jacob et al 2014 vuković et al 2018 hydrological models forced with downscaled gcms data as inputs are widely applied to quantify the hydrologic impact of climate change rainfall runoff models are often used to model runoff they transform precipitation into runoff depending on the parameters selected to describe the catchment a conceptual model based on reservoir storage and simplified equations of physical hydrological processes are used in the present research as is a semi distributed conceptual model hbv hydrologiska byråns vattenbalansavdelning light bergström 1976 to simulate the runoff process in a catchment based on precipitation air temperature and potential evapotranspiration data bhattarai et al 2018 seibert and vis 2012 groundwater level gwl predictions have usually been made using physically based models which rely on mathematical equations to describe physical relationships tapoglou et al 2014 wunsch et al 2018 these are the most comprehensive groundwater models but they have many practical limitations because they are always data demanding zhang et al 2018 and many of these data are usually difficult to obtain jha and sahoo 2015 conversely artificial neural networks ann simply determine the system patterns based on the relationships between inputs and outputs mapped in the training process barzegar et al 2017 since the processes associated with groundwater in nature are highly complex ann are frequently used in groundwater modeling jha and sahoo 2015 wunsch et al 2018 many researchers have investigated the performance of ann models in gwl predictions chang et al 2015 djurovic et al 2015 jha and sahoo 2015 tapoglou et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 an ann model was used in the present research to predict gwl changes because it did not require accurate physical characterization of the study area in the west balkans there is a large number of small catchments that are physically similar they are generally in part mountainous which makes them sensitive to temperature variations and thus to potential climate change as well traditionally these mountainous regions are underdeveloped they are generally rural with farming established in lowland parts of river catchments for many people living in these areas agriculture is the primary activity and sole source of income any reduction in agricultural production threatens their livelihood it is therefore very important to asses how climate change will affect water resources in rural areas in the future a potential decrease in the quantity of water resources would not only hinder and reduce agricultural production but also affect already lackluster socioeconomic circumstances lead to further deterioration of the living conditions of the rural population and likely boost migration or result in increasing poverty the development of water conservation strategies requires projections of surface water and groundwater availability in mountainous regions in the near and distant future as such they are also required for decision making with regard to the selection and implementation of climate change adaptation measures aimed at maintaining agricultural production in rural mountainous regions of the west balkans a representative catchment of the toplica river in an underdeveloped region of serbia was selected for the case study past studies associated with these areas included only assessments of climate change impact on surface water resources ivković and kržič 2017 langsholt et al 2013 todorović and plavšić 2015 available literature sources report little research on the impact of climate change on groundwater in west balkans the aim of the study was to complement past research and add to general insight into the potential climate change impact on water availability in mountainous catchments the specific objectives of the study were to 1 detect temporal trends of temperature potential evapotranspiration precipitation runoff in the entiretoplica river catchment and groundwater in the lowland part of the catchment 2 quantify their projected changes in the near and distant future per two emission scenarios and 3 analyze mutual relationships between these variables in order to clarify the impact of climate change on water resources the research conclusion would be applicable to all catchments with similar climate conditions and similar physical and geographical characteristics another important contribution of the study is the proposed methodology that effectively combines a soft computing technique and conceptual model as it represents a sound numerical framework for modeling of hydrological correlations along with climate models it provides predictions for the near and distant future 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the study area is the catchment of the toplica river a left tributary of the južna morava in serbia fig 1 river discharge was analyzed up to the gauging station at doljevac fig 2 corresponding to a catchment area of 2052 km2 the catchment of the toplica river is located between latitudes 42 62 and 43 24 n and longitudes 20 45 and 21 54 e the elevations range from 190 to 2016 m the climate is humid and semi humid the weighed annual average precipitation is 635 mm for the period from 1971 to 2000 for the same period the weighted annual average potential evapotranspiration is 811 mm the mean discharge recorded by the gauging station at doljevac is 9 21 m3 s 1971 2000 the national hydrometeorological service of serbia monitors water table fluctuations at eight observation wells in the lowland part of the toplica catchment these observation wells were installed in july 1988 at distances of 10 to 520 m from the riverbank they are 6 3 to 10 m deep observations are generally made once in ten days most of the observation wells have been intermittently in and out of service observation well 3 540 fig 2 was selected for modeling because of a monitoring data gap of only one month the thickness of the aquifer ceiling at this observation well is 1 6 m and that of the aquifer 5 6 m the average depth to groundwater gwd is 2 9 m 2 2 data the case study used both observed and projected hydro meteorological data the recorded hydrological data including daily discharges and river stages at the doljevac station 1961 2010 and monthly water table data from eight observation wells 1988 2016 were made available by the national hydrometeorological service of serbia http www hidmet gov rs daily data on precipitation p and air temperature tmax tmin and tmean were collected from weather stations in the cities of niš kuršumlija and prokuplje and on mt kopaonik nhss http www hidmet gov rs the locations of the stations in the catchment are shown in fig 2 given that the weather parameters recorded by these stations did not have the same effect across the study area the values were weighted by the thiessen polygon method to derive representative values for the entire catchment daily potential evapotranspiration pet was calculated based on daily temperatures from the above mentioned weather stations and then weighted applying the thiessen polygon method previous investigations have shown that pet formulas based on temperature tend to provide good discharge simulation oudin et al 2005 the temperature based modified hargreaves approach was used the hargreaves

using the results of seven regional climate models from the euro cordex project table 1 the resolution was 12 5 km the projections pertain to daily values for the period 2021 2100 the simulations were based on representative concentration pathways rcps scenarios rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 rcp scenarios assume pathways to different target radiative forcing at the end of the 21st century scenario rcp4 5 supposes an increase in radiative forcing of 4 5 w m2 by the end of the century whereas scenario rcp8 5 assumes 8 5 w m2 relative to pre industrial conditions moss et al 2010 a high resolution ensemble of regional climate models was developed for europe within the scope of the world climate research program coordinated regional downscaling experiment euro cordex project http www euro cordex net euro cordex gathered together simulations of regional climate models generated by downscaling global climate models from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 jacob et al 2014 the climate parameters minimum maximum and mean air temperature and precipitation projected using the seven rcms were statistically corrected by quantile mapping this is a standard method for eliminating the bias inherent in all numerical models cumulative probability density functions cdf of daily climate observations were compared to the models output at the closest model point for the reference period 1971 2000 under the assumption that daily temperature data follows the gaussian dettinger et al 2004 and precipitation data without dry days the two parameter gamma distribution piani et al 2010 the number of dry days was corrected by equating the observed and modeled dry days wood et al 2004 if a model produced more dry days than observed randomly selected days were wetted with minimal precipitation if the number of dry days was smaller than observed randomly chosen drizzle days were artificially dried corrective functions that transfer modeled to observed values were developed for every climate parameter each model and every month after matching modeled to observed cdfs the corrective functions were applied to the models results for the reference and both future periods a high level of uncertainty is associated with climate projections the multimodel approach balances out different model concepts and objectives and thus reduces the bias and provides more reliable results than the single model method seiller et al 2012 the multimodel ensemble climate simulations which was selected for the present research has been used in many other studies e g

calibrated hbv light model seibert and vis 2012 the projections of future daily discharges by that model are based on the entry of weighted from four weather stations projected daily climate input data the p and t projections are a result of seven climate models and two scenarios each pet was calculated eq 1 on the basis of the projected t these 14 datasets for q constitute the hydrological projection of runoff as impacted by climate change from 2021 to 2100 the hbv light model is founded upon the conceptual hbv model bergström 1976 and is commonly used inter alia for climate change studies bhattarai et al 2018 etter et al 2017 langsholt et al 2013 seiller et al 2012 the hbv light model is a semi distributed hydrological model comprised of several modules the snow routine the soil routine the response or groundwater routine and the routing routine the snow routine calculates snow accumulation and snow melt by the degree day method at temperatures below a threshold value all precipitation is considered to be snow in the soil and groundwater routines groundwater recharge actual evapotranspiration and runoff are simulated as functions of water storage total runoff is transformed by a triangular weighting function in the routing routine as altitude increases the model adjusts daily precipitation totals and mean daily temperatures through a linear increase 100 m and linear decrease c 100 m respectively a more detailed description of the hbv light model and the governing equations as calibration parameters are provided in the literature seibert and vis 2012 the

calibrated against the daily discharges observed at the doljevac gauging station along with daily precipitation mean daily temperatures and calculated pet prepared by weighing data from the four weather stations fig 2 all simulations pertained to the hydrologic year 1 october to 30 september and a warm up period preceded each simulation the calibration period was selected following a review of the climate conditions from 1961 to 2010 series of consecutive average wet years were selected by the moving average method and the calibration was based on them using the gap algorithm genetic algorithm and powell s method comprised of a genetic algorithm for regional optimization and an algorithm for local optimization of that region powell s method seibert 2000 the model was calibrated according to a weighted objective function of which included the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse criterion nash and sutcliffe 1970 eq 2 nse which was calculated from logarithmed discharges nselogq eq 3

sample test dss test klemeš 1986 seiller et al 2012 validation periods did not overlap with the model calibration period 3 2 2 groundwater levels a soft computing artificial neural network ann model was used to predict groundwater levels one month in advance the ann approach can be followed to model correlations among certain physical quantities and the variable whose value needs to be predicted neural networks comprise multiple interconnected layers the layer that receives input signals is called the input layer and it generally only buffers the input signal the input layer contains the values of the physical quantities that affect the variable that is to be predicted the output from the network is generated by the output layer all layers between the input layer and the output layer are called hidden layers because they are within the network and have no direct contact with the external environment an ann can have zero to several hidden layers a feedforward network with one hidden layer fig 4 was set up for the present research as it yields sound groundwater level predictions bowden et al 2005 coulibaly et al 2000 kumar et al 2016 rakhshandehroo et al 2012 ann was used to model the correlation between gwl in the lowland part of the catchment and the discharge of the toplica river observation well 3 540 whose location is shown in fig 2 was selected as representative for depicting gwl the starting point for determining the input variables was a priori knowledge about the physical processes to be modeled some researchers bowden et al 2005 kumar et al 2016 have applied analytical techniques like cross correlation and autocorrelation to establish a linear correlation between variables the present study used the correlation analysis taking the physical quantities whose future projections were available and which were assumed based on experience to potentially affect groundwater levels gwl in the preceding period q of the toplica river p pet and air t all the parameters were expressed on a monthly basis for the period from july 1988 to december 2016 making up a time series of 342 data points the output layer had only one variable monthly gwl at the observation well trial and error best showed that the activation function for the hidden layer was a tansig and for the output layer a purelin function the number of nodes in the hidden layer was also determined by trial and error it was varied from 3 to 6 and the mean squared error mse was calculated the conclusion was that as the number of nodes in the hidden layer increased the quality criteria slightly improved decreased but the structure of the network and the number of parameters to be adjusted increased considerably as such it was decided that three nodes in the hidden layer was a sound tradeoff between modeling quality and network training complexity three hidden nodes are also suggested in the literature coulibaly et al 2001 daliakopoulos et al 2005 djurovic et al 2015 tsanis et al 2008 the levenberg marquardt lm method jha and sahoo 2015 wunsch et al 2018 of error back propagation was used for ann training the end of training required one of the following three conditions maximum number of iterations 1000 was selected prediction error threshold 0 01 was selected or variation of the mse criterion for the validation test if the mse criterion increased in six consecutive epochs training was discontinued this condition was imposed to prevent a data overfitting ann the ann model prepared in this manner predicted gwl from 2021 to 2100 using projected values of q by the hbv light model based on projected values of p tmean and pet climate models 3 3 data analysis climate change was examined over the period from 2021 to 2100 on an annual and monthly time scale relative to the reference period 1971 2000 to eliminate the climate and hydrological model bias the simulated future values were compared to the simulated values in the reference period rather than gauged values shen et al 2018 changes were assessed following the multimodel approach to reduce climate model uncertainties the multimodel ensemble comprised seven climate models for each rcp scenario the medians of the time series were used in order to mitigate the effect of outliers believed to become more frequent in the future a change in the median of tmean was expressed as an absolute value in c whereas those of pet p q and gwd were shown as relative values in eq 6 6 δ medianx sim f u t medianx sim r e f medianx sim r e f 100 where δ is the projected difference of the median x is the simulated value of pet p q or gwd in the reference period and future period the temporal variation in the mean ensemble median differences was expressed through 51 future 29 hydrological year periods time slices moving from 2021 to 2100 at a 1 year time step 2021 2050 2035 s 2022 2051 2036 s 2071 2100 2085 s the existence of a trend and its statistical significance were checked the distribution of the time series of hydrometeorological variables whose trend was examined in the present study was checked by the kolmogorov smirnov and shapiro wilk normality tests razali and wah 2011 p 0 05 the finding was that the time series did not fulfill the criteria for parametric tests non parametric methods mann kendall s trend test mk and sen s slope estimator were used to determine the trend and its statistical significance in the time series mondal et al 2012 mk test data need not conform to any particular distribution and that is why this test is often used to quantify the statistical significance of trends in hydrometeorological time series mondal et al 2012 shen et al 2018 tabari et al 2011 the mk test requires the time series to be serially independent to avoid the effect of autocorrelation in the time series on the statistical significance of the trend the original time series was pre whitened before applying the mk test mondal et al 2012 autocorrelation in the time series was established using the r based software package acf which is freely available from the web site https www rdocumentation org packages forecast versions 8 4 topics acf the r based software package modified mkv1 1 0 https www rdocumentation org packages modifiedmk versions 1 1 0 was used to determine the magnitude of the trend and slope this software tests the serial correlation and the applied pre whitening technique performs the mk test at a significance cutoff level of p 0 05 and computes sen s slope parameter on the basis of which the slope of the trend is estimated the statistical significance of the projected changes in the annual and monthly values of p tmean pet q and gwd were assessed by mann whitney s mw test mann and whitney 1947 at a significance cutoff level of p 0 05 the mw test is a non parametric rank based test for assessing the statistical significance of the difference in the median or mean of two time series which is commonly used to test hydrological time series reshmidevi et al 2018 the test is based on the null hypothesis that the medians of two compared time series are the same as opposed to the alternative hypothesis that there is a statistically significant difference the mw test was applied to check the statistical significance of the change in the mean ensemble median of the time series in the near 2035s and distant 2085 s future relative to the reference period 1971 2000 4 results and discussion 4 1 calibration and validation the hbv light model used to project discharges at the end of the century was calibrated prior to application since both wet and dry years are expected in the future the model was calibrated against an average wet period to equally simulate both extreme climate conditions for the 1961 2010 period the moving average method was applied and 13 average wet periods were identified their lengths were from 5 to 12 years each of these 13 periods was gap optimized and each comprised 10 000 model runs and 1000 runs for local optimization powell s method as a result 13 times 10 of the best sets according to the of criterion were identified based on the achieved values of of nse nselogq and ve and the deviation of the monthly discharge distribution from that of the reference period 1971 2000 one of the ten best sets of parameters for the period 1994 1999 was selected for the calibration the efficiency criterion values for this calibration period were of 0 83 nse 0 76 nselogq 0 82 and ve 1 the model calibrated in this way was validated against various climate conditions to test its applicability to warm cold wet and dry years the moving average method was applied to select the warm cold dry and wet validation periods 19 from 1961 to 2010 the nse based on which the fit of simulated and observed values was assessed was greater than 0 6 in order to apply the ann model which was used to project gwl correlation analysis was used to check the strength of the correlation among gwl at the observation wells and different climate and hydrological parameters table 2 observation well 3 540 was deemed representative and selected for modeling it provided regular readings except for one month and exhibited a statistically significant correlation between gwl fluctuations on its location and fluctuations at the remaining seven observation wells where r 0 71 0 88 p 0 01 the results presented in table 2 show a statistically significant positive correlation r 0 87 p 0 01 between gwl and the tested hydrological parameters river stage and discharge in the specific case the climate parameters on a monthly basis exhibited no statistically significant correlation with gwl this was the reason for opting for a simple neural network for which the input data included the discharges of the toplica river in month t q t and groundwater level at observation well 3 540 in month t 1 gwl t 1 the output from the neural network was gwl in the observed month t or gwl t fig 5 shows the measured and simulated values of gwl from 1988 to 2016 the simulation dataset was divided into three groups 70 of the data from the available time series was used for training 15 was used for validation and 15 was reserved for testing the correlation coefficient of the measured and simulated data from each group training validation and testing was in the interval from 0 92323 to 0 96536 and of the entire dataset 0 9309 fig 6 discharges q t projected by hbv light and groundwater levels in the preceding month gwl t 1 generated by the ann model were used to predict future groundwater levels gwl t 4 2 climate change projections 4 2 1 projected changes in temperature ipcc projections suggest considerable global warming through to the end of 2100 kovats et al 2014 le treut et al 2007 this was corroborated by the present research the upward trend of the absolute change in the median of annual tmean in both scenarios was found to be statistically significant according to the mann kendall test p 0 05 mk p 0 05 the projected increase is 0 02 c year and 0 05 c year for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively the projections for rcp8 5 exhibited a statistically significant positive trend mk p 0 05 for all months as well the slopes ranged from 0 04 c year to 0 07 c year the mann whitney test p 0 05 mw p 0 05 showed a statistically significant temperature increase on each of the tested timescales annual and monthly according to scenario rcp4 5 by the end of the century the increase in the median of annual tmean will be 2 c relative to the reference period and according to rcp8 5 more than double 4 2 c fig 7 a fig 7 b and c shows the results of the mann whitney test p 0 05 by month with significant differences fill marked the predicted increases in tmean by month were in the interval from 0 6 c to 2 6 c in rcp4 5 and as much as 1 1 c to 5 1 c in rcp8 5 for the generally warmest months july and august the increase in the median of tmean is expected to be the largest from approximately 2 5 c for rcp4 5 to 5 c for rcp8 5 at the end of the century winter temperatures are also expected to increase by 3 3 c 4 8 c at the end of the century in the rcp8 5 scenario fig 7 c previous research in serbia has reported an increasing temperature trend in the past ruml et al 2017 this will continue to be the case in the future as corroborated by the present study other studies that address future climate change parameters in serbia e g vuković et al 2018 report the same temperature increases at the beginning and end of the century in both scenarios as the present research most studies worldwide agree with the projected temperature increase during the 21st century kovats et al 2014 lobanova et al 2018 papadimitriou et al 2016 reshmidevi et al 2018 shen et al 2018 4 2 2 projected changes in potential evapotranspiration potential evapotranspiration pet has direct implications on the sustainability of surface and subsurface water resources green et al 2011 pan et al 2015 so a pet projection analysis is provided below pet was calculated by the modified hargreaves temperature based method since the analysis is based on temperature projections showing a considerable upward trend towards the end of the century an increase in pet is expected as well green et al 2011 in rcp8 5 the predicted relative change in the median of annual pet was statistically significant mk p 0 05 and indicated an increase of 0 16 year for the same scenario the mk trend test p 0 05 showed a statistically significant upward trend of monthly pet for all months as well as of tmean whereas scenario rcp4 5 suggested a statistically significant upward trend only from february to may the mw test p 0 05 of the median of pet indicated a statistically significant increase on an annual and monthly scale except in october and april according to rcp4 5 fig 8 a at the end of the century in rcp8 5 the projection indicated twice as much potential annual evapotranspiration 14 5 compared to rcp4 5 7 1 a comparison of monthly variability of the median of monthly pet for rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 showed considerably larger differences between the near and distant future in rcp8 5 the highest percent increase of 32 4 is expected in january at the end of the century according to rcp8 5 fig 8 b in the same scenario the increase in potential evapotranspiration in august was percentually smaller 14 6 but the increase in absolute values was 3 5 times greater than in january the highest temperatures and the largest water deficit will likely occur in summer the resulting increase in pet towards the end of century is consistent with the findings of researchers in other parts of the world green et al 2011 kovats et al 2014 pan et al 2015 reshmidevi et al 2018 4 2 3 projected changes in precipitation precipitation p is an important component of the hydrologic cycle because it affects runoff and groundwater green et al 2011 singh and kumar 2010 precipitation projections were analyzed on different time scales annual and monthly although the mk test p 0 05 showed no statistically significant trend in the annual data the mw test p 0 05 indicated a statistically significant increase in the median of annual p of 7 2 compared to the reference period in scenario rcp8 5 in the distant future relative differences in the median of p between the near and distant future on both time scales and their statistical significance according to the mw test p 0 05 are shown in table 3 the results of the analysis of monthly data were divided into the warm half year from april to september warm season and the cold half year from october to march cold season fig 9 indicates the deviation of the median of p from that in the reference period shown for 51 future 29 year periods time slices and two different rcp scenarios separately for the warm and cold season according to rcp4 5 a decrease in the median of p is projected for the warm season except for the months of april and may fig 9 a in the case of rcp8 5 fig 9 b shows that the decreases in most of the future periods are related to the warmest part of the year june july and august with august being the leading month in this regard the mw test p 0 05 corroborated that the decrease in august by as much as 35 at the end of the century in rcp8 5 was statistically significant the mk test p 0 05 of the warm season months indicated a statistically significant trend of the relative differences in the median of p only for the month of june rcp8 5 with a decrease of 0 04 year an increase in the median of p is expected in the entire cold season and all future periods except in december for which a decrease is expected in some time slices fig 9 c and d for that season the test mk p 0 05 did not reveal a statistically significant trend for any of the months the change in the median of p in 2035 s and 2085 s relative to the reference period based on the mw test p 0 05 was statistically significant for several months table 3 the largest increase of 38 was in march in the near future and 35 in february in the distant future rcp4 5 in the case of rcp8 5 the largest statistically significant increase in the median of p was 30 in march in the distant future in the past there has been a generally upward precipitation trend in serbia ruml et al 2016 but a downward trend in the summer months in central and southern serbia where the catchment of the toplica river is located vuković et al 2018 the future projections of p in the present research are consistent with the projections derived for the same two rcp scenarios of future ghg emissions in serbia vuković et al 2018 the same projected decrease in precipitation in the summer months and increase in the cold season has also been reported for the part of europe that includes serbia havril et al 2018 kovats et al 2014 lobanova et al 2018 4 3 impact of climate change on hydrological variables 4 3 1 projected changes in discharge kovačević majkić and urošev 2014 reported no statistically significant change in annual discharge q at the doljevac gauging station from 1961 to 2010 and no statistically significant trend of monthly q during the same period the present research also found no statistically significant trend mk p 0 05 in the projected change in the median of annual q the mw test p 0 05 did not predict statistically significant changes in the median of annual q in the near and distant future in both scenarios table 3 the relative difference in the median of q in the near and distant future on both time scales and its statistical significance according to the mw test p 0 05 are shown in table 3 it is apparent that the number of months with a statistically significant change in the median of q in rcp4 5 was greater 5 months in the near future than in the distant future 3 months however rcp8 5 showed the opposite with as many as six months in the distant future the largest predicted percent changes in both the near and distant future were associated with august and september in the warm season and january in the cold season these changes were also statistically significant except in the near future in rcp8 5 with regard to monthly q the mk test p 0 05 showed a statistically significant downward trend only for may of 0 38 year in rcp8 5 the warm season was characterized by a lower median of q relative to the reference period in all future periods for three and four months in rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively fig 10 a and b the largest decrease in the median of q was in august and september the change in the median of q in summer and early autumn was larger in 2085 s than 2035 s in both scenarios and the peak q in spring decreased and shifted towards winter particularly in rcp8 5 at the end of the century this variation in q is consistent with the findings of schneider et al 2013 the median of q is expected to increase in the entire cold season except for the month of october in both scenarios fig 10 c and d the difference between october and the other months of the cold season suggests a longer warm season which is consistent with the results for central and eastern europe papadimitriou et al 2016 in addition an increase in q during winter and in late autumn is indicated by research in connection with the danube river basin lobanova et al 2018 the toplica river falls within that basin past research predicts a decrease in q on an annual scale in the toplica catchment langsholt et al 2013 todorović and plavšić 2015 the forecasts are based on climate parameters resulting from previous projections according to ipcc sres scenarios a2 and a1b nakicenovic et al 2000 where annual p is expected to decrease 4 3 2 projected changes in groundwater level on an annual scale no statistically significant trend was noted in the median of the depth to groundwater gwd mk p 0 05 the mw test p 0 05 also showed no statistically significant variation in the median of gwd at this scale in either the near or distant future table 3 shows the relative difference in the median of gwd in the near and distant future on all time scales as well as its statistical significance according to the mw test p 0 05 in the warm season there is a statistically significant positive gwd trend declining gwl mk p 0 05 in may 0 04 year in rcp4 5 and in rcp8 5 in july 0 03 year and august 0 02 year in the cold season there is a statistically significant positive gwd trend mk p 0 05 in january 0 01 year in rcp4 5 and in november 0 03 year in rcp8 5 although mw p 0 05 predicts minor changes in the median of gwd in both the warm and cold season in the interval from 4 6 to 2 6 these changes are statistically significant for a large number of months of these months in the near and distant future in both scenarios 44 showed a statistically significant change table 3 the warm season in the 51 future periods is characterized by an increase in gwd lowering of the water table relative to the reference period except for the months of april and may as well as june in the first half of the 21st century rcp4 5 fig 11 a in rcp8 5 an increase in gwd is projected for all months except for april where there was a partial increase and partial decrease in gwd fig 11 b fig 11 c shows that a decrease in gwd increase in gwl was projected for all time slices of the cold season rcp4 5 and all months except for october in rcp8 5 the increase in gwd apart from october also generally included the month of november fig 11 d the extended increase in gwd might be indicative of a longer dry period as in the case of q due to warming and a higher rate of evapotranspiration kovats et al 2014 the predicted decrease in gwd in the future in the cold season and increase in the warm season is consistent with the ipcc technical paper bates et al 2008 such changes would boost the seasonality of the hydrologic regime a possibility pointed out by taylor et al 2013 4 4 analysis of relationships among and between climatic and hydrologic variables on an annual scale the mk test p 0 05 showed no statistically significant trend for p q and gwd in either scenario a statistically significant upward trend in both scenarios is expected for tmean as well as pet but only in rcp8 5 compared to the reference period at the end of the century statistically significant mw p 0 05 increases in annual p 7 2 and annual pet 14 5 were predicted in rcp8 5 these increases together will result in an annual increase in q of only 2 and an increase in gwd of as little as 0 7 which were not recognized as statistically significant by the mw test p 0 05 consequently on the annual scale no notable changes are expected in the availability of water in the study area for the study period 2021 2100 the mk test p 0 05 showed a statistically significant upward trend of pet for all months but only in rcp8 5 under the same conditions a statistically significant trend of p q and gwd was predicted for only a few months one for p and q and three for gwd the mw test p 0 05 identified the months in which changes in p q and gwd were all statistically significant in 2035 s rcp4 5 these were march and july at the end of the century 2085 s the months in both scenarios were january and august joined by december in rcp8 5 the quantity of water is expected to increase in these cold season months and decrease in summer this suggests a more pronounced non uniformity of the monthly distribution the catchment of the toplica river is in part rainfall dominated the remaining mountainous area is snowmelt dominated characterized by an abundance of water in spring due to snow melt and spring rains the variation in p due to climate change will largely affect the rainfall dominated part of the catchment whereas the increase in t will have an impact on higher elevations with more snow cover at the end of the century in rcp8 5 due to the expected increase in p and t in winter q will likely increase considerably 29 50 during the period from november to february this increase might be due to the increase in p as well as p partly being in the form of rain rather than snow the response of groundwater in shallow aquifers to this change in q will be a small decrease in the depth to groundwater increase in groundwater level the winter increase in q will also increase the flood risk during that period in the reference period the toplica river recorded the highest discharges in march and april the effect of warming was assessed by comparing projections for march in the near and distant future in rcp8 5 in the near future due to the increase in p 14 7 tmean 2 c and pet 9 q is expected to increase by 17 3 and gwd to decrease groundwater level to increase by 3 in the distant future double the increase in p 29 5 will decrease q and gwd by only 0 4 because of the double increase in tmean 4 5 c and pet 20 this suggests that at the end of the century q will peak before march as a result of the projected warming a positive aspect of the decrease in spring q when q is generally the highest will be a reduced flood risk the projections for the warm season showed a decrease in p and increase in tmean and pet such conditions will increase the irrigation demand towards the end of the century the monthly q variability of the toplica river showed the lowest discharges from august to october distant future predictions suggested that the summer decrease in p in august by as much as 34 5 statistically significant and the statistically significant increase in pet will result in a large percent decrease in q august 29 september 42 and october 43 4 the decrease in september and october mw p 0 05 was also statistically significant a statistically significant increase in gwd was projected from july to october 2 1 to 2 5 q is expected to decrease and gwd to increase in eight months of the year which will extend the period of low water availability reduced water availability in the warm period might have an adverse effect on agriculture because that period coincides with the growing season of a large number of crops smaller quantities and higher temperatures of river water will have an adverse effect on water quality this might threaten the aquatic ecosystem and reduce available amounts of high quality water the problem is of a global nature in regions where reduced water quantities are projected van vliet et al 2013 the present study along with many others corroborates that climate change will alter the hydrologic cycle and thus the hydrologic regime of any given area donnelly et al 2017 green et al 2011 schneider et al 2013 4 5 uncertainty of projection the study did not take into account potential changes due to anthropogenic factors which are of course unavoidable but beyond the scope of this research as others have pointed out all these predictions primarily depend on the selection of climate models reshmidevi et al 2018 as they bring about the largest uncertainty karlsson et al 2016 refsgaard et al 2016 shen et al 2018 additional influence comes from hydrological and groundwater modeling gädeke et al 2014 singh and kumar 2010 in order to minimize uncertainty an ensemble of seven rcms were used in the present study to derive climate projections the use of an ensemble of hydrological models may help reduce the uncertainty inherent in hydrological models reshmidevi et al 2018 this uncertainty is also affected by the selection of the calibration period todorovic and plavsic 2016 as such climate conditions were analyzed in the present study to determine the calibration and validation periods in general the uncertainties inherent in hydrological impact modeling can be reduced by collecting high quality data refsgaard et al 2016 an insufficiently developed network of observation wells is a special limiting factor in the assessment of groundwater response to climate change 5 conclusion based on the reported case study of the toplica river according to scenario rcp8 5 no notable water quantity variations on an annual scale are expected through to the end of the century however there will likely be more prominent changes on a monthly scale relative to the current distribution as a result of the projected warming peak q is expected to decrease and occur earlier before march in spring when q is the highest the flood risk is expected to be lower in general the quantity of water will likely increase in winter and decrease in summer both q and gwl are expected to decline during eight months of the year meaning that the period of reduced water supply will be longer the projected decrease in p q and gwl in summer when the study area experiences a water deficit even at present might have multiple adverse effects on agriculture water supply hydropower fisheries the river ecosystem and tourism at the end of the century scenario rcp 4 5 shows less pronounced changes in hydrologic variables than scenario rcp 8 5 the above conclusions are applicable to the development of strategic adaptation plans in agriculture and other sectors that rely on water not only in the study area but also other areas with similar climate conditions and comparable physical and geographic characteristics of which there are many in the west balkans a particular contribution of the study relates to the fact that this is an initial study in the region where groundwater level projections were made insight into the trend is extremely important because groundwater is the primary source of water supply for irrigation as well as other segments of water use another contribution of this study is the proposed methodology which effectively combines a soft computing technique and conceptual model with climate models and is applicable to other catchments the inclusion of an ann model which does not require knowledge of the geology of the area is of particular importance this is a significant advantage especially in underdeveloped countries where detailed geological investigations have not been undertaken due to funding issues methodologies that include modeling also involve the uncertainty of each model the issue of uncertainties inherent in climate modeling could be addressed by involving an even larger number of climate models to arrive at more realistic climate projections an ensemble of hydrological models and high quality input data might help reduce the uncertainty of hydrological modeling the next step would be the inclusion of crop models in the research with a view to recommending the most suitable crops for the projected climate conditions and water availability declaration of competing interest
