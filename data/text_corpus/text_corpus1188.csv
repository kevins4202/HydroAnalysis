5940,water isotopes in precipitation provide new insight on the controlling factors for moisture source variations on the tibetan plateau however understanding the intra annual water isotope cycle is difficult for a region lack of winter precipitation here we reported water vapor δ18o and δ2h time series over two and half years at lhasa on the southern tibetan plateau we compare our values with concurrent daily precipitation isotopes to assess the seasonal controls of vapor isotopes and possible correlation to precipitation isotopes results show an intra seasonal dependence of water vapor δ18o on large scale meteorological regime during the winter months vapor water δ18o shows positive dependence on regional scale temperature confirming a rayleigh distillation controlling moisture transport during the summer months lower vapor δ18o is weekly in association with the heavy precipitation over tropical indian ocean and on the tibetan plateau and this relation is further enhanced by the evaporation of precipitation at the sampling site we also found a weak seasonal variation of vapor d excess likely resulted from climate seasonality over the large moisture sources region moreover the isotope dataset contains a high frequency of fluctuations for both δ18o and d excess lasting several days during the summer monsoon season these high frequency fluctuations are in phase with precipitation events confirming significant local evaporation effects on the short term water cycle which further complicated the control of near surface water vapor isotopes these findings improve our regional scale understanding of hydrological cycle on the southern tibetan plateau and will potentially improve our understanding of isotope variations in proxy archives in the tibetan plateau keywords vapor isotopes southern tibetan plateau seasonality precipitation d excess 1 introduction stable water isotope ratios 18o 16o and 2h 1h are natural tracers of hydrological cycle and can be used to reconstruct paleoclimatic temperature records with varying time scale jouzel et al 2000 thompson et al 1997 over the tibetan plateau tp the mechanisms controlling the variations in precipitation isotopes remain open to debate for the monsoon regions such as the southern tp precipitation isotopes are weakly correlated to air temperature brown et al 2006 modeled precipitation isotope is significantly related to local precipitation amount on the tp and the interpretation of these ice core records as temperature proxies on the tp is in doubt brown et al 2006 the relationship between precipitation isotope and climate parameters is also sensitive to the timescales and changes spatially and the climate reconstruction is far more complex than the simple local regression noone and simmonds 2002 further studies also indicated that the local precipitation amount is insignificant and regional atmospheric circulation drove the isotopic values e g breitenbach et al 2010 moerman et al 2013 rahul et al 2016 there is an increasing consensus that variations in precipitation and water vapor isotopes can identify moisture sources aggarwal et al 2004 breitenbach et al 2010 in particular the seasonal dynamics of moisture sources and transport pathways breitenbach et al 2010 he et al 2015 and the convectional intensity in the moisture source region cai et al 2017 continuous monitoring of vapor isotope variations on the tp has the potential to reveal the controlling factors while understanding the cause of these variations in the context of the water vapor cycle is challenging previous studies have focused on the local controls of water vapor isotopes in recent studies water vapor isotopes have been used in the study of regional water cycle to understand their sensitivity to phase change steen larsen et al 2013 wen et al 2010 yu et al 2015 many of these studies employed continuous measurements of water vapor isotopes identifying the influence of moisture sources moisture transportation the seasonal controlling and the contribution of local evaporation and transpiration as main controls rahul et al 2016 salamalikis et al 2015 for example continuous measurements of near surface vapor isotopes on the greenland ice sheet bonne et al 2014 steen larsen et al 2014 siberia bastrikov et al 2014 and eastern china wen et al 2010 found a strong relationship with local surface humidity these studies help understand the atmosphere processes e g evaporation moisture transport precipitation that govern the precipitation isotopes assisting in paleoclimate interoperations from isotope archive as in ice core galewsky et al 2016 landais et al 2012 steen larsen et al 2013 on the tp the interaction of the summer indian monsoon and the prevailing winter westerlies strongly controls the seasonal shifts of precipitation amounts and sources the indian monsoon is the main source of the annual precipitation for the tp tian et al 2001 in association with intensive convection precipitation along the moisture route and precipitation location and monsoon precipitation is greatly depleted in heavy isotopes at the monsoon onset risi et al 2008 in the non monsoon season the prevailing westerlies bring less precipitation to the tp thus it is difficult to clearly interpret the seasonal water isotope cycle on the tp huang and wen 2014 kurita and yamada 2008 water δ18o increases toward the tp inland in both precipitation tian et al 2003 and ice cores thompson et al 1989 suggesting a strong influence of regional evaporation in the atmosphere observation of lake water isotopes over the tp also revealed significantly enriched isotope value due to the water surface evaporation cui et al 2017 tian et al 2008 in particular annual average water vapor isotopes are important in estimation of lake water isotope hydrology gibson et al 2002 tian et al 2008 yet water vapor isotopes are usually unavailable and are estimated from precipitation isotope for simplicity in practice however this approach is in challenge in regions with strong seasonal precipitation as in most part of the tp the simultaneous measurement of both precipitation and water vapor isotopes on the tp allows for a comparison between isotopes in vapor and precipitation for this purpose only a few short term studies of water vapor isotopes have been published on the tp and adjacent regions huang and wen 2014 kurita and yamada 2008 yu et al 2015 yu et al 2016 and to date there is no year round and multiyear records of duel water vapor isotopes on the tp thus a lack of understanding the seasonal changes in water vapor δ18o and d excess defined as d excess δ2h 8 δ18o dansgaard 1964 on the tp still exists continuous observation of water vapor isotopes can provide new insight on the seasonality of moisture cycle and controls coupled observations of water vapor isotopes and precipitation isotopes may reveal a relationship between surface water vapor and precipitation here we report results from the continuous measurement of daily water vapor δ18o and δ2h at lhasa southern tp over two and half years and discuss the seasonal changes of water vapor isotopes δ18o and d excess and relationships between water vapor isotopes and precipitation isotopes these findings can help for an improved understanding of the water cycle on the southern tp and potentially the paleoclimate change in various isotope archives 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the sampling station at lhasa 29 39 n 91 02 e 3658 m msl is in a valley lying in the southern tp fig 1 with an average annual precipitation of 432 mm and air temperature of 8 1 c based on the meteorological station data during 1955 2013 over 90 of precipitation falls in the summer months of june september resulting from the strong influence of the indian monsoon during winter the prevailing westerly results in dry and cold climate 2 2 sampling and measurements water vapor was collected using a cryogenic trapping method the water vapor was pumped from an inlet approximately 10 m above the land surface through a teflon tube to a glass trap immersed in pure ethanol this electric powered system uses two levels of compressors that can maintain a cold environment of below 80 c during the water vapor sampling the cold trap was immersed in 95 ethanol with 70 1 c which causes the water vapor to sublimate to ice immediately at the upper part of the tube and allows for the collection of liquid water for δ18o and δ2h analysis in the laboratory in addition the performance of the cryogenic trapping method was assessed by connecting an extra glass trap to the outlet of the original trap no visible further condensation was noticed confirming the trap was working efficiently yu et al 2015 the air flow was controlled by a flow meter with a rate of 5 l min one frozen vapor sample was collected after 24 hr running in summer season while every 48 hr was used to collect one sample in dry winter season one sample of approximately 10 20 ml in liquid water was collected during each operation all the collected samples were refrozen in a freezer below 15 c until analysis a detailed sampling procedure is found in yu et al 2015 in total 792 water vapor samples were collected continuously during the period of over two and half years from jan 1st 2012 to sep 18th 2014 daily precipitation was sampled by a specially designed container see supporting material fig s1 rainfall collected by a funnel flew to a 2 l nalgene bottle through a plastic tube a hook at the end of the tube can prevent the evaporated vapor from escaping to the free atmosphere after sampling a thin plastic tube with over 2 m in length connected the inside of the collecting bottle with the free atmosphere to balance the air pressure between two sides fig s1 the container can effectively minimize the influence of evaporation of the collected sample thereby preventing further fractionation of precipitation during the full day sampling snow samples were placed into a plastic bag for melting at room temperature and then poured into plastic bottles each sample was collected at 20 00 every day if precipitation occurred the collected precipitation samples were frozen in a freezer until was transported to the laboratory for measurement a total of 291 precipitation samples were collected during the sampling period of march 3 2012 september 22 2014 stable isotopic compositions of these samples were measured at the key laboratory of tibetan plateau environment changes and land surface processes institute of tibetan plateau research of the chinese academy of sciences in beijing using picarro 2130i liquid water stable isotope analyzer the value of each isotopic ratio is expressed as per mil relative to vienna standard mean ocean water 2 vsmow2 the measured precision is 0 10 for δ18o 0 4 for δ2h and 1 2 for estimated d excess respectively to confirm proper performance of the cold trap operation a comparison observation of water vapor isotopes using a direct measurement method was also conducted on site for several days in the comparison air was directly pumped through a teflon tube attached to the roof of the building into a picarro 2130i cavity ring down spectroscopy crds the two methods shared the same pumping line and measured in the same room for consistence of the input water vapor a standard delivery module sdm was used to measure the isotopic composition of vaporized water standards an in situ measurement method we used two laboratory standard water samples with δ18o values of 6 1 and 32 2 and δ2h values of 50 3 and 241 9 which roughly cover the range of the water vapor isotope variations for comparison the daily average isotope values were calculated from 20 00 in previous day to 20 00 however standard water calibration in the in situ method broke the continuous vapor measurement caused slight difference in measured duration the water vapor δ18o and d excess values from the two methods are shown in table 1 the results show that water vapor δ18o values measured by the two methods are quite consistent with differences within the precision and accuracy of the water isotope analyzer the consistency confirmed that our isotope results from the cryogenic trapping method are reliable an exception on september 19 2013 is due to the large different sampling measuring hours in the two methods and possible large diurnal variation of vapor isotopes 2 3 meteorological and reanalysis data long term meteorological monthly data 1955 2013 and daily meteorological data air temperature precipitation amount vapor pressure during 2012 2014 at lhasa meteorological station 29 40 n 91 08 e 3650 m are acquired from china meteorological data service center http data cma cn data on application long term climate data are used to present the general seasonal climate condition for the research site and daily meteorological data are used to compare with the daily vapor isotope variation observed at lhasa the total precipitation and 2 m temperature data at 0 75 0 75 resolution in the era interim dataset are obtained from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf public datasets web interface http apps ecmwf int datasets ncar ncep 2 5 deg global reanalysis data during the period of 2012 2014 were used in the calculation of the moisture back trajectory by using hydplit mode which are available at https www esrl noaa gov 2 4 hysplit model calculation we identify the vapor transport path by using the hysplit hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectory model stein et al 2015 daily moisture trajectory for the sampling period jan 1st 2012 sep 18th 2014 was calculated for the 4 days prior the sampling date with a starting height of 100 m over the measuring site at lhasa then we used the build in cluster analysis mode to make cluster analysis for these daily back trajectory results for both monsoon season and non monsoon for each cluster we also calculated the frequency of the daily trajectories after that we averaged the vapor isotope values of all individual days when their trajectories fall in the same cluster in effect to discuss the influence of different moisture sources 2 5 isotope fractionation in water evaporation we calculated the isotopes in the evaporated vapor of precipitation to evaluate the relation between the measured daily precipitation isotopes and vapor isotopes in monsoon season we used a simple evaporation model in that the isotope fractionation during evaporation is a sum of the equilibrium fractionation which is determined by temperature and kinetic fractionation in terms of humidity gonfiantini 1986 1 δ v δ p ε v p ε k where δv is isotope value in evaporated vapor δ p is isotope value in precipitation εv p is for the equilibrium isotope fractionation and εk for kinetic fractionation εv p is dependent on temperature and is taken from the fractionation equation of kakiuchi and matsuo 1979 the kinetic isotopic separation εk is given in terms of relative humidity h with the following relationships for 18o and 2h separately gonfiantini 1986 ε k 18 o 14 2 1 h 2 ε k 2 h 12 5 1 h 3 3 results 3 1 temporal variations of water vapor δ18o and d excess the seasonal water vapor isotope variations observed for lhasa is shown in fig 2 following is a description of the measured temporal vapor isotope variations the mean daily water vapor δ18o is 23 1 with an extreme minimum of 37 7 and maximum of 10 0 the data demonstrate a consistent seasonality of water vapor δ18o during the years measured from the beginning of the year water vapor δ18o increases from a minimum of around 30 to maximum of 15 in may in phase with increasing air temperature see supporting material fig s2 after may the vapor δ18o dropped sharply and lasted throughout the monsoon season until september large fluctuations of vapor δ18o isotopes are observed in this monsoon season usually with duration of a few days after the monsoon season there was a slight increase of water vapor δ18o and a shift to the winter δ18o minimum with the lowest air temperature daily water vapor d excess shows a mean of 19 4 with maximum of 38 3 and minimum of 8 4 vapor d excess shows large magnitude fluctuations throughout the year but with a weak seasonality there is an obvious lower d excess period in the monsoon season june september correlating with the earlier observed low d excess in summer precipitation tian et al 2007 a peak of d excess is found in spring of both 2012 and 2013 but not pronounced in 2014 3 2 local influence on the seasonality of water vapor isotopes in the asian monsoon region the sharp drop of precipitation isotopes in the early summer is coincident with the northern shift of the intertropical convergent zone and hence related to the outgoing longwave radiation cai and tian 2016 to assess the influence on seasonal change of water vapor δ18o we separate the measurement period into monsoon and non monsoon seasons we define the monsoon season as the date from the sharp drop of water vapor δ18o in early summer until the last increase in september specifically the monsoon season was june 17 september 30 in 2012 june 15 september 30 in 2013 and june 20 september 18 in 2014 the rest of the year is defined as non monsoon season we first assessed the relationship between vapor isotope with local humidity and air temperature fig 3 we found a weak inverse correlation between water vapor δ18o between monsoon season and non monsoon season the gradual increase in water vapor δ18o from january to may roughly corresponds to increases in vapor pressure while an inverse relation exists from june until the end of september during the monsoon season see supporting material fig s3 these relations are also revealed in the scattered relationships between daily water vapor δ18o and vapor pressure in fig 3a for the relationship with air temperature fig 3b there is a positive relation in non monsoon season but no relation in monsoon season no obvious change of water vapor d excess is found with neither air temperature nor humidity 3 3 local meteorological water lines lmwl and relationship between vapor δ18o and δ2h daily precipitation isotopes during 2013 and 2014 were measured at lhasa δ18o in precipitation show large daily variation ranging from 27 5 to 7 5 with an average of 14 7 δ2h varies from 212 7 to 58 5 with an average of 112 0 in fig 4 the lmwl is compared with the relationship between water vapor δ18o and δ2h for both the two seasons separately statistically significant differences are apparent in the intercept between the seasonal vapor δ18o and δ2h relationship δ2h 7 41 0 03 δ18o 2 59 0 88 r 0 997 n 314 p 0 05 for the monsoon season and δ2h 7 82 0 04 δ18o 16 59 0 88 r 0 994 n 478 p 0 05 for the non monsoon season the difference in intercept is due to the higher d excess in non monsoon season than in monsoon season fig 2 the correlation for all water vapor samples is δ2h 7 80 0 03 δ18o 14 75 0 79 r 0 993 n 796 p 0 05 almost parallel with the lmwl of δ2h 8 11 0 12 δ18o 7 00 1 96 r 0 988 n 111 p 0 05 with a large difference in intercept 3 4 air mass trajectory and seasonal water vapor isotope variations moisture sources influence seasonal water vapor δ18o variations araguás araguás et al 1998 breitenbach et al 2010 on average water vapor δ18o showed lower δ18o in monsoon periods and higher δ18o in non monsoon periods to evaluate vapor isotopes δ18o from different moisture sources in the southern tp we traced the moisture source changes during the overall measurement periods using the hysplit model the back trajectory analysis results are presented in fig 5 separately for monsoon and non monsoon season in the monsoon season fig 5a there were two predominant moisture sources from the south one from the bay of bengal accounted for over half 52 of the moisture supply cluster 1 and the other from the southwest cluster 2 with a contribution of 28 originating from the arabian sea vapor isotopes from the two source regions had consistent average isotope values 26 5 4 8 and 26 2 3 9 a small moisture supply from the north cluster 3 with a contribution of 20 had an slightly higher average vapor δ18o of 24 7 4 1 the slightly difference between north south moisture isotope is probably related to the finding of higher δ18o in precipitation tian et al 2007 and surface water bershaw et al 2012 northwards due to enhanced inland water recycling in non monsoon seasons fig 5b a dominant westerly source of moisture supply originated from the prevailing westerlies of the five clusters in the trajectory results the two cluster 1 and 2 from northwest india are the dominant clusters of moisture supplies 65 and a small portion 6 in cluster 5 from central asia with cluster 4 13 from the northwest and cluster 3 from bangladesh 16 four of the five clusters of moisture trajectories have statistically consistent water vapor δ18o from west and south in fig 5b one possibility reason is that under the large spatial scale of the westerlies moisture sources are homogeneous however moisture from the northwest cluster 4 has a significantly lower average δ18o of 25 1 5 3 almost 4 lower than moisture from other clusters this moisture was likely from cold air masses with depleted heavy isotopes araguás araguás et al 1998 the back trajectory results indicate a seasonal shift of moisture sources with different isotopic footprints moisture from south with lower isotope values dominated the moisture supply in summer monsoon season while moisture from west with a relatively higher isotope values prevailed in the non monsoon season on average the water vapor δ18o in the monsoon season is approximately 5 lower than in the non monsoon season the analysis also found that statistically no significant vapor isotope difference exists for the different moisture sources in either monsoon season or non monsoon season for instance the average vapor δ18o in the three clusters varies slightly between 24 7 and 26 5 in monsoon season fig 5a in non monsoon season four of the five clusters of moisture trajectories had the vapor δ18o between 21 7 and 20 9 on average and only a small portion of northern moisture had significantly lower isotope values of 25 1 fig 6 b though large latitudinal change in water δ18o was found in both precipitation and surface water bershaw et al 2012 tian et al 2001 the variations of vapor δ18o between southern and northern moisture sources in the monsoon season fig 5a is much smaller entrainment of local vapor during moisture transport may modify the vapor isotopic composition leading to the smaller south north variations in vapor isotopes average d excess in each clusters are also presented see supporting material fig s4 vapor d excess shows slight lower values from the southern source in the monsoon season however no obvious difference was found in average vapor d excess among different moisture sources neither in monsoon season nor in non monsoon season 3 5 correlations analysis between seasonal water vapor δ18o and large regional temperature and precipitation to better understand the influence of large regional climate on the seasonal shift of vapor isotopes correlation analysis was calculated between lhasa daily water vapor δ18o and era interim 2 m temperature results show a clear seasonal pattern of the spatial correlations fig 6 in the monsoon season a weak relation was found between water vapor δ18o and temperature negative correlation in the southern tp and a positive relation in the india subcontinent and some parts of indian ocean fig 6a in non monsoon season water vapor δ18o shows a strong positive correlation with 2 m temperature across the large northern hemisphere region fig 6b the correlation in the entire observation period shows a varying spatial distribution from positive relation in the indian subcontinent and indian ocean to no relation over the tp fig 5c the spatial correlation analysis was also performed between lhasa vapor δ18o and era interim daily precipitation amount for vapor isotope data in winter samples collected in every other day average of the two days precipitation amount was used results show an obvious negative correlation between lhasa water vapor δ18o and precipitation amount across the indian subcontinent and southern tp for the entire periods fig 6f this is resulted from distinctive seasonality with strong monsoon precipitation and much deleted vapor δ18o in summer while less precipitation with higher vapor δ18o in spring fig s3 however the correlations both within the monsoon season and non monsoon season are weak in the monsoon season fig 6d a weak negative correlation is found over the tropical indian ocean and the region surrounding the sampling site in the southern tp while no obvious negative correlation in non monsoon season fig 6e 4 discussion 4 1 controls of seasonal shift of water vapor isotopes in the southern tp the correlation analysis between lhasa water vapor isotopes and climate condition on both local and regional scale allows for a discussion on the control of the seasonality of vapor isotopes the observed seasonal shift of water vapor δ18o with increasingly heavier trend from the beginning of the year and sharp depletion from the early summer is consistent with that in precipitation in the southern tp tian et al 2003 in non monsoon season positive correlation between vapor δ18o and the large regional air temperature change fig 6b implies that a rayleigh distillation process dominated moisture transport from the source region to the collecting site in that the vapor parcel distillation depleted residual vapor isotope and led to low residual vapor fraction our results indicate a temperature dependence of water vapor isotope on a regional scale including the moisture region over the ocean in monsoon season no positive correlation exists between vapor δ18o and air temperature either in the local scale or regional scale figs 3b and 6a however there is a weak negative correlation between vapor δ18o and large regional precipitation amount as compared with that in precipitation isotope e g he et al 2018 this weak correlation implies that strong convection precipitation depleted the residual water vapor isotope in the tropical indian ocean in monsoon season and to some extent influence near surface vapor isotope in the southern tp in the entire observation period the negative correlation is also apparent in the southern tp and the indian subcontinent more clear in fig 6f probably implying that the water vapor δ18o is further depleted on the path from the source region to the sampling site through the rainout process supporting the earlier observation of higher correlation with upstream convective activity especially for the northern indian and lhasa precipitation isotopes he et al 2015 and the deep convection rainfall in the indian continent dong et al 2016 precipitation and ice core isotope record inherited the seasonal water vapor isotope signals for the precipitation isotope limited observation in winter season over the southern tp revealed that the temperature effects only exists in the non monsoon season yu et al 2008 while in summer season both vapor and precipitation isotopes were influenced by upstream and local precipitation kurita and yamada 2008 the coexistence of both temperature effect and precipitation amount effect in the seasonal scale yang et al 2011 making the interpretation of ice core isotope record controversial brown et al 2006 for the ice core isotope record the seasonal signal is influenced by both precipitation isotope and seasonal precipitation patterns the precipitation isotope in alpine glacier in the asia monsoon region may bear the similar seasonal signal as that in the vapor isotopes however the seasonal precipitation pattern varies and therefore the seasonal precipitation pattern exert a strong effect on tp ice core isotope record for example in dasuopu ice core from central himalayas clear seasonal isotope record was recorded due to the high non monsoon precipitation tian et al 2003 however in the northern himalayas and most of the central and northern tp the seasonal isotope signal is vague due to the lack of non monsoon precipitation nozomu et al 2009 shao et al 2017 then we will discuss the seasonality of vapor d excess with that in precipitation water vapor d excess is thought to be a signal from evaporation conditions of moisture sources aemisegger 2014 jouzel et al 1997 in the northern hemisphere the seasonal precipitation d excess are characterized by higher values in winter and lower in summer for the different evaporation conditions over the ocean surface jouzel et al 1997 in asia both moisture source and process during vapor transport can modify precipitation d excess bershaw 2018 our observed vapor d excess shows a weak seasonal cycle being slightly higher in non monsoon seasons averaging 20 3 4 9 than in monsoon seasons averaging 18 2 3 8 the relatively higher water vapor d excess in non monsoon seasons is likely the result of evaporation from water and or land surfaces under low humidity in summer monsoon seasons there is a slight drop of surface vapor d excess d excess in precipitation was featured with obvious higher value prior the monsoon season and post monsoon season while lower value in the summer monsoon season as found in the source area of bay of bengal chakraborty et al 2016 and at the southern slope of himalayas tian et al 2007 such variability is generally in accordance with the weak seasonal change of vapor d excess in lhasa however the seasonal contrast in vapor d excess is much weaker than in precipitation partially because the rainfall evaporation in monsoon season increased the d excess in near surface vapor hence reduced the seasonal contrast in vapor d excess which will be discussed in the later section we noticed that the phase of seasonal variation in vapor d excess and δ18o doesn t match higher d excess appears prior to the monsoon onset and after monsoon season while d excess in monsoon season are generally in lower level the drop of vapor d excess is approximately one month earlier than the vapor δ18o drop during the early summer fig 2 in 2012 vapor d excess dropped from april 29 while δ18o dropped from may 31 in 2013 vapor d excess dropped from april 7 while δ18o dropped from may 22 such spring related high vapor d excess is not apparent in 2014 but it shows a gradual decrease preceding the δ18o drop the phase difference between vapor δ18o and d excess likely suggests a de coupling different controls of the two water isotope signals unlike d excess which is assumed to be controlled by the sea surface climate condition in the source region the sharp depletion in vapor δ18o is in phase with the onset of indian monsoon suggesting strong convection from source regions to the precipitation sampling site cai and tian 2016 he et al 2015 the phase difference may be preserved in the ice core isotope record an ice core record from the middle tp showed that the seasonal d excess signal is much stronger than δ18o shao et al 2017 our measurements of both water vapor δ18o and d excess in the southern tp provides further evidence of the general atmospheric influence of the seasonal water vapor isotope variation and thereby precipitation isotopes in the indian monsoon region this seasonal shift of vapor isotope δ18o was also observed in the indian peninsular srivastava et al 2015 suggesting a significant spatial coherence of vapor isotope across the monsoon region 4 2 relationship of water vapor isotopes and precipitation isotopes daily precipitation δ18o is compared with water vapor δ18o fig 7 the water vapor δ18o shows a correlation with precipitation δ18o δ18ov 0 76 δ18op 15 02 r 0 88 n 108 p 0 01 indicating a general equilibrium between the two phases of water agreeing with result from a similar study on the middle of the tp yu et al 2015 this also agrees with earlier findings that the vapor in the surface layer was in general brought to state of equilibrium during rainfall midhun et al 2013 conroy et al 2016 on average the difference between precipitation δ18o p and δ18o v δ18o p v δ18o p δ18o v is 11 4 during precipitation days however we also found that individual δ18o p v is positively related to precipitation δ18o fig 8 we divide the δ18op variations into two zones by δ18o p 10 the average δ18o p v is 10 8 when δ18o p 10 but increases to 13 6 when δ18op 10 this phenomenon is probably related to precipitation processes heavy rainfall in strong monsoon precipitation will produce lower precipitation δ18op see fig 9 and also depress the kinetic fractionation in raindrop evaporation subsequently resulting in relatively small δ18o p v however small rainfall will enhance the kinetic fractionation in raindrop evaporation and therefore larger δ18o p v to validate this assumption we made a simple simulation of isotope fractionation in raindrop evaporation descripted in earlier section we made two assumptions one is that only equilibrium fractionation occurred in 100 humidity and one for a kinetic fractionation in lower relative humidity results showed a simulated difference of 10 3 between δ18op and δ18ov under equilibrium assumption consistent with the observed δ18o p v of 10 8 when δ18o p 10 we used the average meteorological air temperature data of 14 8 c during precipitation days as the fractionation temperature in the kinetic fractionation assumption in relative humidity here we use rh 0 56 as observed in monsoon break periods the simulation gave a δ18o p v of 16 5 larger than the observed value of 13 6 indicating kinetic evaporation in weak monsoon precipitation will produce a higher δ18o p v as we observed here our discussions on the relation between the observed vapor and precipitation isotopes support the assumption that the near surface vapor is influenced by evaporation of local precipitation during precipitation events conroy et al 2016 steen larsen et al 2013 it also indicates that the evaporated vapor isotope is roughly in equilibrium with precipitation isotope in heavy rainfall while kinetic fractionation in small precipitation will enlarge the difference between vapor and precipitation δ18op since the vapor isotope was practically estimated from annual precipitation isotope value in the simulation of water body isotope balance we also discuss the relation between annual vapor δ18o and annual precipitation δ18o based on our observation the annual average of the weighted precipitation δ18o of 17 36 and water vapor δ18o of 23 15 yield a difference of 5 8 between the two annual weighted δ18o this difference is significantly lower than the estimated difference of 10 3 under the equilibrium assumption the smaller difference is largely due to the fact that there is almost no precipitation in winter season while vapor δ18o is relatively higher than in summer season this result suggests that the equilibrium assumption between the annual average ambient δ18o and annual precipitation δ18o is questionable in regions with strong precipitation seasonality and local processes highlighting the importance for long term and continuous monitoring of water vapor isotopes for the variation of vapor d excess there is a growing consensus that near surface water vapor d excess is not a conserved quantity of marine evaporation conditions as once thought but that it is highly sensitive to changes in local evaporation steen larsen et al 2013 wen et al 2010 we compared the d excess in both water vapor and precipitation in precipitation days fig 7b in southern tp we notice a large fluctuation in precipitation d excess as compared with water vapor d excess due likely to the fact that the evaporation of falling raindrops may further lower precipitation d excess on average d excess in water vapor is 13 9 higher than in precipitation following we made an attempt to simulate the relation between the daily precipitation d excess and concurrent d excess by assuming re evaporation of raindrop with different relative humidity conditions we simply assumed the water vapor is from the evaporation of the precipitation with air temperature of 14 8 c and used the kinetic fractionation model gonfiantini 1986 to estimate the difference between evaporated vapor and precipitation d excess in the first step we assumed the relative humidity of 56 the average meteorological data during precipitation days and the simulation yielded a value of approximately 35 difference between precipitation and vapor d excess much higher than the observed value only with assumed relative humidity of 0 77 can the simulation reach an observed difference of 13 9 we see that different relative humidity can produce large difference in evaporated vapor and precipitation d excess the discrepancy between the observed and simulated d excess between vapor and precipitation d excess is possibly related to the fact that more evaporation occurred during rainfall hours relative humidity is higher than daily average however we are aware that more implication is not allowed since precipitation d excess itself was influenced by re evaporation of rainfall also transpiration and land surface evaporation was not taken into account in the estimation which is generally lower in vapor d excess as compared with the rain evaporation discussed in the following section there are other processes such as water molecule exchange between vapor and raindrop the entrainment of environmental air mesoscale subsidence all can play a role in controlling the isotope composition of surface water vapor tremoy et al 2014 following we discuss the high frequent fluctuations found both in vapor δ18o and vapor d excess in summer monsoon season the higher frequent fluctuations of vapor δ18o in the monsoon season are apparently related to precipitation events for the case in 2013 the high frequency fluctuations of water vapor δ18o show a strong anti phase relation with precipitation events fig 9a similar results are observed for the summer vapor δ18o in 2014 see supporting material fig s5 most precipitation events are in phase with sharp decrease of vapor δ18o while in monsoon break periods the vapor δ18o increased the underlying reason is that precipitation evaporated vapor has lower δ18o from the high altitude vapor in the cloud while moisture from local evapotranspiration has higher vapor δ18o daily vapor d excess fluctuations are also related to precipitation fig 9b higher precipitation days are roughly in phase with higher vapor d excess the relationships are likely related to the kinetic fractionation during the gradual influence of evaporation of precipitation subsequently reducing the d excess in rainfall and raising the d excess in the evaporated vapor which was also found in the raining season of the middle tp kurita and yamada 2008 to confirm this explanation we also compared the relations between vapor δ18o and d excess during monsoon and non monsoon seasons separately fig 10 the correlation in monsoon season is significant d excess 2 59 δ18o 0 88 r 0 71 p 0 05 while no relationship in non monsoon seasons the robust negative correlation in the monsoon season reflected in fig 10a confirmed that rainfall intensity produced the coherent daily variations of vapor δ18o and d excess statistic shows that vapor d excess in raining days is 18 9 in average 3 3 higher than in the non rain days during the monsoon seasons in 2012 2014 further supporting the idea that the increasing portion of precipitation evaporation to the lower level atmosphere increased vapor d excess the results of this study indicate precipitation evaporation plays an important role in the temporal fluctuations of water vapor d excess in summer monsoon season as a result the strong influence of precipitation evaporation on near surface water vapor δ18o and d excess further complicates the control of vapor isotopes over the tp 5 conclusions this paper discussed the different behaviors of vapor isotopes in monsoon season and non monsoon season based on the measurements of daily water vapor and precipitation isotopes in the southern tp the large seasonal variation of water vapor δ18o is interpreted as a result of large regional atmospheric influence but obviously influenced by isotope fractionation during precipitation evaporation a positive relationship exists between vapor δ18o and large regional air temperatures in non monsoon season implying the underlying mechanism of rayleigh distillation in rainout processes in the monsoon season lower vapor δ18o is weakly in associated with the strong precipitation events over moisture source regions in the tropical indian ocean and over the sampling region on the southern tp as well the simultaneous daily δ18ov and δ18op variations show parallel change and an obvious correlation indicating a general equilibrium between the two phases of water however high frequency fluctuations of vapor δ18o lasting for several days in the monsoon season indicates a notable influence of precipitation events on vapor isotopes an in phase changes of water vapor isotopes with precipitation amounts observed in the monsoon season likely result from the evaporation of precipitation the comparison of δ18ov and δ18op during the observation periods yield a weighted annual difference significantly lower than the equilibrium assumption highlighting the necessary of continuous observation of annual vapor isotopic data in regions with high seasonal precipitation the weak seasonal pattern of vapor d excess varying from year to year is thought to be resulted from climate seasonality over the large moisture sources region however local influence is apparent and the high frequent in phase changes of vapor d excess and precipitation events in monsoon season is resulted from the evaporation of precipitation we also found a seasonal shift of moisture change with a different isotopic footprint moisture sources in summer monsoon season are dominated by supply from the south characterized by a lower water isotopic value while in non monsoon season moisture sources are from west with relatively higher water vapor isotopes we are aware that further work is still necessary for a better understanding of the water vapor isotopes and in particular the control from more other factors we discussed the seasonal control of vapor isotopes influenced by both the large regional atmospheric conditions and the local scale water cycle apparently the local evaporation fractionation modified the observed vapor isotope and hence complicated the controlling on seasonal vapor isotopes our data showed a complex pattern of vapor d excess primarily due to the combined influence of moisture source climate and local influence we also noticed that transpiration and soil evaporation account substantial component in the terrestrial evapotranspiration and therefore influence the atmosphere vapor isotope which was not discussed in

5940,water isotopes in precipitation provide new insight on the controlling factors for moisture source variations on the tibetan plateau however understanding the intra annual water isotope cycle is difficult for a region lack of winter precipitation here we reported water vapor δ18o and δ2h time series over two and half years at lhasa on the southern tibetan plateau we compare our values with concurrent daily precipitation isotopes to assess the seasonal controls of vapor isotopes and possible correlation to precipitation isotopes results show an intra seasonal dependence of water vapor δ18o on large scale meteorological regime during the winter months vapor water δ18o shows positive dependence on regional scale temperature confirming a rayleigh distillation controlling moisture transport during the summer months lower vapor δ18o is weekly in association with the heavy precipitation over tropical indian ocean and on the tibetan plateau and this relation is further enhanced by the evaporation of precipitation at the sampling site we also found a weak seasonal variation of vapor d excess likely resulted from climate seasonality over the large moisture sources region moreover the isotope dataset contains a high frequency of fluctuations for both δ18o and d excess lasting several days during the summer monsoon season these high frequency fluctuations are in phase with precipitation events confirming significant local evaporation effects on the short term water cycle which further complicated the control of near surface water vapor isotopes these findings improve our regional scale understanding of hydrological cycle on the southern tibetan plateau and will potentially improve our understanding of isotope variations in proxy archives in the tibetan plateau keywords vapor isotopes southern tibetan plateau seasonality precipitation d excess 1 introduction stable water isotope ratios 18o 16o and 2h 1h are natural tracers of hydrological cycle and can be used to reconstruct paleoclimatic temperature records with varying time scale jouzel et al 2000 thompson et al 1997 over the tibetan plateau tp the mechanisms controlling the variations in precipitation isotopes remain open to debate for the monsoon regions such as the southern tp precipitation isotopes are weakly correlated to air temperature brown et al 2006 modeled precipitation isotope is significantly related to local precipitation amount on the tp and the interpretation of these ice core records as temperature proxies on the tp is in doubt brown et al 2006 the relationship between precipitation isotope and climate parameters is also sensitive to the timescales and changes spatially and the climate reconstruction is far more complex than the simple local regression noone and simmonds 2002 further studies also indicated that the local precipitation amount is insignificant and regional atmospheric circulation drove the isotopic values e g breitenbach et al 2010 moerman et al 2013 rahul et al 2016 there is an increasing consensus that variations in precipitation and water vapor isotopes can identify moisture sources aggarwal et al 2004 breitenbach et al 2010 in particular the seasonal dynamics of moisture sources and transport pathways breitenbach et al 2010 he et al 2015 and the convectional intensity in the moisture source region cai et al 2017 continuous monitoring of vapor isotope variations on the tp has the potential to reveal the controlling factors while understanding the cause of these variations in the context of the water vapor cycle is challenging previous studies have focused on the local controls of water vapor isotopes in recent studies water vapor isotopes have been used in the study of regional water cycle to understand their sensitivity to phase change steen larsen et al 2013 wen et al 2010 yu et al 2015 many of these studies employed continuous measurements of water vapor isotopes identifying the influence of moisture sources moisture transportation the seasonal controlling and the contribution of local evaporation and transpiration as main controls rahul et al 2016 salamalikis et al 2015 for example continuous measurements of near surface vapor isotopes on the greenland ice sheet bonne et al 2014 steen larsen et al 2014 siberia bastrikov et al 2014 and eastern china wen et al 2010 found a strong relationship with local surface humidity these studies help understand the atmosphere processes e g evaporation moisture transport precipitation that govern the precipitation isotopes assisting in paleoclimate interoperations from isotope archive as in ice core galewsky et al 2016 landais et al 2012 steen larsen et al 2013 on the tp the interaction of the summer indian monsoon and the prevailing winter westerlies strongly controls the seasonal shifts of precipitation amounts and sources the indian monsoon is the main source of the annual precipitation for the tp tian et al 2001 in association with intensive convection precipitation along the moisture route and precipitation location and monsoon precipitation is greatly depleted in heavy isotopes at the monsoon onset risi et al 2008 in the non monsoon season the prevailing westerlies bring less precipitation to the tp thus it is difficult to clearly interpret the seasonal water isotope cycle on the tp huang and wen 2014 kurita and yamada 2008 water δ18o increases toward the tp inland in both precipitation tian et al 2003 and ice cores thompson et al 1989 suggesting a strong influence of regional evaporation in the atmosphere observation of lake water isotopes over the tp also revealed significantly enriched isotope value due to the water surface evaporation cui et al 2017 tian et al 2008 in particular annual average water vapor isotopes are important in estimation of lake water isotope hydrology gibson et al 2002 tian et al 2008 yet water vapor isotopes are usually unavailable and are estimated from precipitation isotope for simplicity in practice however this approach is in challenge in regions with strong seasonal precipitation as in most part of the tp the simultaneous measurement of both precipitation and water vapor isotopes on the tp allows for a comparison between isotopes in vapor and precipitation for this purpose only a few short term studies of water vapor isotopes have been published on the tp and adjacent regions huang and wen 2014 kurita and yamada 2008 yu et al 2015 yu et al 2016 and to date there is no year round and multiyear records of duel water vapor isotopes on the tp thus a lack of understanding the seasonal changes in water vapor δ18o and d excess defined as d excess δ2h 8 δ18o dansgaard 1964 on the tp still exists continuous observation of water vapor isotopes can provide new insight on the seasonality of moisture cycle and controls coupled observations of water vapor isotopes and precipitation isotopes may reveal a relationship between surface water vapor and precipitation here we report results from the continuous measurement of daily water vapor δ18o and δ2h at lhasa southern tp over two and half years and discuss the seasonal changes of water vapor isotopes δ18o and d excess and relationships between water vapor isotopes and precipitation isotopes these findings can help for an improved understanding of the water cycle on the southern tp and potentially the paleoclimate change in various isotope archives 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the sampling station at lhasa 29 39 n 91 02 e 3658 m msl is in a valley lying in the southern tp fig 1 with an average annual precipitation of 432 mm and air temperature of 8 1 c based on the meteorological station data during 1955 2013 over 90 of precipitation falls in the summer months of june september resulting from the strong influence of the indian monsoon during winter the prevailing westerly results in dry and cold climate 2 2 sampling and measurements water vapor was collected using a cryogenic trapping method the water vapor was pumped from an inlet approximately 10 m above the land surface through a teflon tube to a glass trap immersed in pure ethanol this electric powered system uses two levels of compressors that can maintain a cold environment of below 80 c during the water vapor sampling the cold trap was immersed in 95 ethanol with 70 1 c which causes the water vapor to sublimate to ice immediately at the upper part of the tube and allows for the collection of liquid water for δ18o and δ2h analysis in the laboratory in addition the performance of the cryogenic trapping method was assessed by connecting an extra glass trap to the outlet of the original trap no visible further condensation was noticed confirming the trap was working efficiently yu et al 2015 the air flow was controlled by a flow meter with a rate of 5 l min one frozen vapor sample was collected after 24 hr running in summer season while every 48 hr was used to collect one sample in dry winter season one sample of approximately 10 20 ml in liquid water was collected during each operation all the collected samples were refrozen in a freezer below 15 c until analysis a detailed sampling procedure is found in yu et al 2015 in total 792 water vapor samples were collected continuously during the period of over two and half years from jan 1st 2012 to sep 18th 2014 daily precipitation was sampled by a specially designed container see supporting material fig s1 rainfall collected by a funnel flew to a 2 l nalgene bottle through a plastic tube a hook at the end of the tube can prevent the evaporated vapor from escaping to the free atmosphere after sampling a thin plastic tube with over 2 m in length connected the inside of the collecting bottle with the free atmosphere to balance the air pressure between two sides fig s1 the container can effectively minimize the influence of evaporation of the collected sample thereby preventing further fractionation of precipitation during the full day sampling snow samples were placed into a plastic bag for melting at room temperature and then poured into plastic bottles each sample was collected at 20 00 every day if precipitation occurred the collected precipitation samples were frozen in a freezer until was transported to the laboratory for measurement a total of 291 precipitation samples were collected during the sampling period of march 3 2012 september 22 2014 stable isotopic compositions of these samples were measured at the key laboratory of tibetan plateau environment changes and land surface processes institute of tibetan plateau research of the chinese academy of sciences in beijing using picarro 2130i liquid water stable isotope analyzer the value of each isotopic ratio is expressed as per mil relative to vienna standard mean ocean water 2 vsmow2 the measured precision is 0 10 for δ18o 0 4 for δ2h and 1 2 for estimated d excess respectively to confirm proper performance of the cold trap operation a comparison observation of water vapor isotopes using a direct measurement method was also conducted on site for several days in the comparison air was directly pumped through a teflon tube attached to the roof of the building into a picarro 2130i cavity ring down spectroscopy crds the two methods shared the same pumping line and measured in the same room for consistence of the input water vapor a standard delivery module sdm was used to measure the isotopic composition of vaporized water standards an in situ measurement method we used two laboratory standard water samples with δ18o values of 6 1 and 32 2 and δ2h values of 50 3 and 241 9 which roughly cover the range of the water vapor isotope variations for comparison the daily average isotope values were calculated from 20 00 in previous day to 20 00 however standard water calibration in the in situ method broke the continuous vapor measurement caused slight difference in measured duration the water vapor δ18o and d excess values from the two methods are shown in table 1 the results show that water vapor δ18o values measured by the two methods are quite consistent with differences within the precision and accuracy of the water isotope analyzer the consistency confirmed that our isotope results from the cryogenic trapping method are reliable an exception on september 19 2013 is due to the large different sampling measuring hours in the two methods and possible large diurnal variation of vapor isotopes 2 3 meteorological and reanalysis data long term meteorological monthly

meteorological data service center http data cma cn data on application long term climate data are used to present the general seasonal climate condition for the research site and daily meteorological

the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf public datasets web interface http apps ecmwf int datasets ncar ncep 2 5 deg global reanalysis data during the period of 2012 2014 were used in the calculation of the moisture back trajectory by using hydplit mode which are available at https www esrl noaa gov 2 4 hysplit model calculation we identify the vapor transport path by using the hysplit hybrid single particle lagrangian integrated trajectory model stein et al 2015 daily moisture trajectory for the sampling period jan 1st 2012 sep 18th 2014 was calculated for the 4 days prior the sampling date with a starting height of 100 m over the measuring site at lhasa then we used the build in cluster analysis mode to make cluster analysis for these daily back trajectory results for both monsoon season and non monsoon for each cluster we also calculated the frequency of the daily trajectories after that we averaged the vapor isotope values of all individual days when their trajectories fall in the same cluster in effect to discuss the influence of different moisture sources 2 5 isotope fractionation in water evaporation we calculated the isotopes in the evaporated vapor of precipitation to evaluate the relation between the measured daily precipitation isotopes and vapor isotopes in monsoon season we used a simple evaporation model in that the isotope fractionation during evaporation is a sum of the equilibrium fractionation which is determined by temperature and kinetic fractionation in terms of humidity gonfiantini 1986 1 δ v δ p ε v p ε k where δv is isotope value in evaporated vapor δ p is isotope value in precipitation εv p is for the equilibrium isotope fractionation and εk for kinetic fractionation εv p is dependent on temperature and is taken from the fractionation equation of kakiuchi and matsuo 1979 the kinetic isotopic separation εk is given in terms of relative humidity h with the following relationships for 18o and 2h separately gonfiantini 1986 ε k 18 o 14 2 1 h 2 ε k 2 h 12 5 1 h 3 3 results 3 1 temporal variations of water vapor δ18o and d excess the seasonal water vapor isotope variations observed for lhasa is shown in fig 2 following is a description of the measured temporal vapor isotope variations the mean daily water vapor δ18o is 23 1 with an extreme minimum of 37 7 and maximum of 10 0 the data demonstrate a consistent seasonality of water vapor δ18o during the years measured from the beginning of the year water vapor δ18o increases from a minimum of around 30 to maximum of 15 in may in phase with increasing air temperature see supporting material fig s2 after may the vapor δ18o dropped sharply and lasted throughout the monsoon season until september large fluctuations of vapor δ18o isotopes are observed in this monsoon season usually with duration of a few days after the monsoon season there was a slight increase of water vapor δ18o and a shift to the winter δ18o minimum with the lowest air temperature daily water vapor d excess shows a mean of 19 4 with maximum of 38 3 and minimum of 8 4 vapor d excess shows large magnitude fluctuations throughout the year but with a weak seasonality there is an obvious lower d excess period in the monsoon season june september correlating with the earlier observed low d excess in summer precipitation tian et al 2007 a peak of d excess is found in spring of both 2012 and 2013 but not pronounced in 2014 3 2 local influence on the seasonality of water vapor isotopes in the asian monsoon region the sharp drop of precipitation isotopes in the early summer is coincident with the northern shift of the intertropical convergent zone and hence related to the outgoing longwave radiation cai and tian 2016 to assess the influence on seasonal change of water vapor δ18o we separate the measurement period into monsoon and non monsoon seasons we define the monsoon season as the date from the sharp drop of water vapor δ18o in early summer until the last increase in september specifically the monsoon season was june 17 september 30 in 2012 june 15 september 30 in 2013 and june 20 september 18 in 2014 the rest of the year is defined as non monsoon season we first assessed the relationship between vapor isotope with local humidity and air temperature fig 3 we found a weak inverse correlation between water vapor δ18o between monsoon season and non monsoon season the gradual increase in water vapor δ18o from january to may roughly corresponds to increases in vapor pressure while an inverse relation exists from june until the end of september during the monsoon season see supporting material fig s3 these relations are also revealed in the scattered relationships between daily water vapor δ18o and vapor pressure in fig 3a for the relationship with air temperature fig 3b there is a positive relation in non monsoon season but no relation in monsoon season no obvious change of water vapor d excess is found with neither air temperature nor humidity 3 3 local meteorological water lines lmwl and relationship between vapor δ18o and δ2h daily precipitation isotopes during 2013 and 2014 were measured at lhasa δ18o in precipitation show large daily variation ranging from 27 5 to 7 5 with an average of 14 7 δ2h varies from 212 7 to 58 5 with an average of 112 0 in fig 4 the lmwl is compared with the relationship between water vapor δ18o and δ2h for both the two seasons separately statistically significant differences are apparent in the intercept between the seasonal vapor δ18o and δ2h relationship δ2h 7 41 0 03 δ18o 2 59 0 88 r 0 997 n 314 p 0 05 for the monsoon season and δ2h 7 82 0 04 δ18o 16 59 0 88 r 0 994 n 478 p 0 05 for the non monsoon season the difference in intercept is due to the higher d excess in non monsoon season than in monsoon season fig 2 the correlation for all water vapor samples is δ2h 7 80 0 03 δ18o 14 75 0 79 r 0 993 n 796 p 0 05 almost parallel with the lmwl of δ2h 8 11 0 12 δ18o 7 00 1 96 r 0 988 n 111 p 0 05 with a large difference in intercept 3 4 air mass trajectory and seasonal water vapor isotope variations moisture sources influence seasonal water vapor δ18o variations araguás araguás et al 1998 breitenbach et al 2010 on average water vapor δ18o showed lower δ18o in monsoon periods and higher δ18o in non monsoon periods to evaluate vapor isotopes δ18o from different moisture sources in the southern tp we traced the moisture source changes during the overall measurement periods using the hysplit model the back trajectory analysis results are presented in fig 5 separately for monsoon and non monsoon season in the monsoon season fig 5a there were two predominant moisture sources from the south one from the bay of bengal accounted for over half 52 of the moisture supply cluster 1 and the other from the southwest cluster 2 with a contribution of 28 originating from the arabian sea vapor isotopes from the two source regions had consistent average isotope values 26 5 4 8 and 26 2 3 9 a small moisture supply from the north cluster 3 with a contribution of 20 had an slightly higher average vapor δ18o of 24 7 4 1 the slightly difference between north south moisture isotope is probably related to the finding of higher δ18o in precipitation tian et al 2007 and surface water bershaw et al 2012 northwards due to enhanced inland water recycling in non monsoon seasons fig 5b a dominant westerly source of moisture supply originated from the prevailing westerlies of the five clusters in the trajectory results the two cluster 1 and 2 from northwest india are the dominant clusters of moisture supplies 65 and a small portion 6 in cluster 5 from central asia with cluster 4 13 from the northwest and cluster 3 from bangladesh 16 four of the five clusters of moisture trajectories have statistically consistent water vapor δ18o from west and south in fig 5b one possibility reason is that under the large spatial scale of the westerlies moisture sources are homogeneous however moisture from the northwest cluster 4 has a significantly lower average δ18o of 25 1 5 3 almost 4 lower than moisture from other clusters this moisture was likely from cold air masses with depleted heavy isotopes araguás araguás et al 1998 the back trajectory results indicate a seasonal shift of moisture sources with different isotopic footprints moisture from south with lower isotope values dominated the moisture supply in summer monsoon season while moisture from west with a relatively higher isotope values prevailed in the non monsoon season on average the water vapor δ18o in the monsoon season is approximately 5 lower than in the non monsoon season the analysis also found that statistically no significant vapor isotope difference exists for the different moisture sources in either monsoon season or non monsoon season for instance the average vapor δ18o in the three clusters varies slightly between 24 7 and 26 5 in monsoon season fig 5a in non monsoon season four of the five clusters of moisture trajectories had the vapor δ18o between 21 7 and 20 9 on average and only a small portion of northern moisture had significantly lower isotope values of 25 1 fig 6 b though large latitudinal change in water δ18o was found in both precipitation and surface water bershaw et al 2012 tian et al 2001 the variations of vapor δ18o between southern and northern moisture sources in the monsoon season fig 5a is much smaller entrainment of local vapor during moisture transport may modify the vapor isotopic composition leading to the smaller south north variations in vapor isotopes average d excess in each clusters are also presented see supporting material fig s4 vapor d excess shows slight lower values from the southern source in the monsoon season however no obvious difference was found in average vapor d excess among different moisture sources neither in monsoon season nor in non monsoon season 3 5 correlations analysis between seasonal water vapor δ18o and large regional temperature and precipitation to better understand the influence of large regional climate on the seasonal shift of vapor isotopes correlation analysis was calculated between lhasa daily water vapor δ18o and era interim 2 m temperature results show a clear seasonal pattern of the spatial correlations fig 6 in the monsoon season a weak relation was found between water vapor δ18o and temperature negative correlation in the southern tp and a positive relation in the india subcontinent and some parts of indian ocean fig 6a in non monsoon season water vapor δ18o shows a strong positive correlation with 2 m temperature across the large northern hemisphere region fig 6b the correlation in the entire observation period shows a varying spatial distribution from positive relation in the indian subcontinent and indian ocean to no relation over the tp fig 5c the spatial correlation analysis was also performed between lhasa vapor δ18o and era interim daily precipitation amount for vapor isotope data in winter samples collected in every other day average of the two days precipitation amount was used results show an obvious negative correlation between lhasa water vapor δ18o and precipitation amount across the indian subcontinent and southern tp for the entire periods fig 6f this is resulted from distinctive seasonality with strong monsoon precipitation and much deleted vapor δ18o in summer while less precipitation with higher vapor δ18o in spring fig s3 however the correlations both within the monsoon season and non monsoon season are weak in the monsoon season fig 6d a weak negative correlation is found over the tropical indian ocean and the region surrounding the sampling site in the southern tp while no obvious negative correlation in non monsoon season fig 6e 4 discussion 4 1 controls of seasonal shift of water vapor isotopes in the southern tp the correlation analysis between lhasa water vapor isotopes and climate condition on both local and regional scale allows for a discussion on the control of the seasonality of vapor isotopes the observed seasonal shift of water vapor δ18o with increasingly heavier trend from the beginning of the year and sharp depletion from the early summer is consistent with that in precipitation in the southern tp tian et al 2003 in non monsoon season positive correlation between vapor δ18o and the large regional air temperature change fig 6b implies that a rayleigh distillation process dominated moisture transport from the source region to the collecting site in that the vapor parcel distillation depleted residual vapor isotope and led to low residual vapor fraction our results indicate a temperature dependence of water vapor isotope on a regional scale including the moisture region over the ocean in monsoon season no positive correlation exists between vapor δ18o and air temperature either in the local scale or regional scale figs 3b and 6a however there is a weak negative correlation between vapor δ18o and large regional precipitation amount as compared with that in precipitation isotope e g he et al 2018 this weak correlation implies that strong convection precipitation depleted the residual water vapor isotope in the tropical indian ocean in monsoon season and to some extent influence near surface vapor isotope in the southern tp in the entire observation period the negative correlation is also apparent in the southern tp and the indian subcontinent more clear in fig 6f probably implying that the water vapor δ18o is further depleted on the path from the source region to the sampling site through the rainout process supporting the earlier observation of higher correlation with upstream convective activity especially for the northern indian and lhasa precipitation isotopes he et al 2015 and the deep convection rainfall in the indian continent dong et al 2016 precipitation and ice core isotope record inherited the seasonal water vapor isotope signals for the precipitation isotope limited observation in winter season over the southern tp revealed that the temperature effects only exists in the non monsoon season yu et al 2008 while in summer season both vapor and precipitation isotopes were influenced by upstream and local precipitation kurita and yamada 2008 the coexistence of both temperature effect and precipitation amount effect in the seasonal scale yang et al 2011 making the interpretation of ice core isotope record controversial brown et al 2006 for the ice core isotope record the seasonal signal is influenced by both precipitation isotope and seasonal precipitation patterns the precipitation isotope in alpine glacier in the asia monsoon region may bear the similar seasonal signal as that in the vapor isotopes however the seasonal precipitation pattern varies and therefore the seasonal precipitation pattern exert a strong effect on tp ice core isotope record for example in dasuopu ice core from central himalayas clear seasonal isotope record was recorded due to the high non monsoon precipitation tian et al 2003 however in the northern himalayas and most of the central and northern tp the seasonal isotope signal is vague due to the lack of non monsoon precipitation nozomu et al 2009 shao et al 2017 then we will discuss the seasonality of vapor d excess with that in precipitation water vapor d excess is thought to be a signal from evaporation conditions of moisture sources aemisegger 2014 jouzel et al 1997 in the northern hemisphere the seasonal precipitation d excess are characterized by higher values in winter and lower in summer for the different evaporation conditions over the ocean surface jouzel et al 1997 in asia both moisture source and process during vapor transport can modify precipitation d excess bershaw 2018 our observed vapor d excess shows a weak seasonal cycle being slightly higher in non monsoon seasons averaging 20 3 4 9 than in monsoon seasons averaging 18 2 3 8 the relatively higher water vapor d excess in non monsoon seasons is likely the result of evaporation from water and or land surfaces under low humidity in summer monsoon seasons there is a slight drop of surface vapor d excess d excess in precipitation was featured with obvious higher value prior the monsoon season and post monsoon season while lower value in the summer monsoon season as found in the source area of bay of bengal chakraborty et al 2016 and at the southern slope of himalayas tian et al 2007 such variability is generally in accordance with the weak seasonal change of vapor d excess in lhasa however the seasonal contrast in vapor d excess is much weaker than in precipitation partially because the rainfall evaporation in monsoon season increased the d excess in near surface vapor hence reduced the seasonal contrast in vapor d excess which will be discussed in the later section we noticed that the phase of seasonal variation in vapor d excess and δ18o doesn t match higher d excess appears prior to the monsoon onset and after monsoon season while d excess in monsoon season are generally in lower level the drop of vapor d excess is approximately one month earlier than the vapor δ18o drop during the early summer fig 2 in 2012 vapor d excess dropped from april 29 while δ18o dropped from may 31 in 2013 vapor d excess dropped from april 7 while δ18o dropped from may 22 such spring related high vapor d excess is not apparent in 2014 but it shows a gradual decrease preceding the δ18o drop the phase difference between vapor δ18o and d excess likely suggests a de coupling different controls of the two water isotope signals unlike d excess which is assumed to be controlled by the sea surface climate condition in the source region the sharp depletion in vapor δ18o is in phase with the onset of indian monsoon suggesting strong convection from source regions to the precipitation sampling site cai and tian 2016 he et al 2015 the phase difference may be preserved in the ice core isotope record an ice core record from the middle tp showed that the seasonal d excess signal is much stronger than δ18o shao et al 2017 our measurements of both water vapor δ18o and d excess in the southern tp provides further evidence of the general atmospheric influence of the seasonal water vapor isotope variation and thereby precipitation isotopes in the indian monsoon region this seasonal shift of vapor isotope δ18o was also observed in the indian peninsular srivastava et al 2015 suggesting a significant spatial coherence of vapor isotope across the monsoon region 4 2 relationship of water vapor isotopes and precipitation isotopes daily precipitation δ18o is compared with water vapor δ18o fig 7 the water vapor δ18o shows a correlation with precipitation δ18o δ18ov 0 76 δ18op 15 02 r 0 88 n 108 p 0 01 indicating a general equilibrium between the two phases of water agreeing with result from a similar study on the middle of the tp yu et al 2015 this also agrees with earlier findings that the vapor in the surface layer was in general brought to state of equilibrium during rainfall midhun et al 2013 conroy et al 2016 on average the difference between precipitation δ18o p and δ18o v δ18o p v δ18o p δ18o v is 11 4 during precipitation days however we also found that individual δ18o p v is positively related to precipitation δ18o fig 8 we divide the δ18op variations into two zones by δ18o p 10 the average δ18o p v is 10 8 when δ18o p 10 but increases to 13 6 when δ18op 10 this phenomenon is probably related to precipitation processes heavy rainfall in strong monsoon precipitation will produce lower precipitation δ18op see fig 9 and also depress the kinetic fractionation in raindrop evaporation subsequently resulting in relatively small δ18o p v however small rainfall will enhance the kinetic fractionation in raindrop evaporation and therefore larger δ18o p v to validate this assumption we made a simple simulation of isotope fractionation in raindrop evaporation descripted in earlier section we made two assumptions one is that only equilibrium fractionation occurred in 100 humidity and one for a kinetic fractionation in lower relative humidity results showed a simulated difference of 10 3 between δ18op and δ18ov under equilibrium assumption consistent with the observed δ18o p v of 10 8 when δ18o p 10 we used the average meteorological air temperature data of 14 8 c during precipitation days as the fractionation temperature in the kinetic fractionation assumption in relative humidity here we use rh 0 56 as observed in monsoon break periods the simulation gave a δ18o p v of 16 5 larger than the observed value of 13 6 indicating kinetic evaporation in weak monsoon precipitation will produce a higher δ18o p v as we observed here our discussions on the relation between the observed vapor and precipitation isotopes support the assumption that the near surface vapor is influenced by evaporation of local precipitation during precipitation events conroy et al 2016 steen larsen et al 2013 it also indicates that the evaporated vapor isotope is roughly in equilibrium with precipitation isotope in heavy rainfall while kinetic fractionation in small precipitation will enlarge the difference between vapor and precipitation δ18op since the vapor isotope was practically estimated from annual precipitation isotope value in the simulation of water body isotope balance we also discuss the relation between annual vapor δ18o and annual precipitation δ18o based on our observation the annual average of the weighted precipitation δ18o of 17 36 and water vapor δ18o of 23 15 yield a difference of 5 8 between the two annual weighted δ18o this difference is significantly lower than the estimated difference of 10 3 under the equilibrium assumption the smaller difference is largely due to the fact that there is almost no precipitation in winter season while vapor δ18o is relatively higher than in summer season this result suggests that the equilibrium assumption between the annual average ambient δ18o and annual precipitation δ18o is questionable in regions with strong precipitation seasonality and local processes highlighting the importance for long term and continuous monitoring of water vapor isotopes for the variation of vapor d excess there is a growing consensus that near surface water vapor d excess is not a conserved quantity of marine evaporation conditions as once thought but that it is highly sensitive to changes in local evaporation steen larsen et al 2013 wen et al 2010 we compared the d excess in both water vapor and precipitation in precipitation days fig 7b in southern tp we notice a large fluctuation in precipitation d excess as compared with water vapor d excess due likely to the fact that the evaporation of falling raindrops may further lower precipitation d excess on average d excess in water vapor is 13 9 higher than in precipitation following we made an attempt to simulate the relation between the daily precipitation d excess and concurrent d excess by assuming re evaporation of raindrop with different relative humidity conditions we simply assumed the water vapor is from the evaporation of the precipitation with air temperature of 14 8 c and used the kinetic fractionation model gonfiantini 1986 to estimate the difference between evaporated vapor and precipitation d excess in the first step we assumed the relative humidity of 56 the average meteorological data during precipitation days and the simulation yielded a value of approximately 35 difference between precipitation and vapor d excess much higher than the observed value only with assumed relative humidity of 0 77 can the simulation reach an observed difference of 13 9 we see that different relative humidity can produce large difference in evaporated vapor and precipitation d excess the discrepancy between the observed and simulated d excess between vapor and precipitation d excess is possibly related to the fact that more evaporation occurred during rainfall hours relative humidity is higher than daily average however we are aware that more implication is not allowed since precipitation d excess itself was influenced by re evaporation of rainfall also transpiration and land surface evaporation was not taken into account in the estimation which is generally lower in vapor d excess as compared with the rain evaporation discussed in the following section there are other processes such as water molecule exchange between vapor and raindrop the entrainment of environmental air mesoscale subsidence all can play a role in controlling the isotope composition of surface water vapor tremoy et al 2014 following we discuss the high frequent fluctuations found both in vapor δ18o and vapor d excess in summer monsoon season the higher frequent fluctuations of vapor δ18o in the monsoon season are apparently related to precipitation events for the case in 2013 the high frequency fluctuations of water vapor δ18o show a strong anti phase relation with precipitation events fig 9a similar results are observed for the summer vapor δ18o in 2014 see supporting material fig s5 most precipitation events are in phase with sharp decrease of vapor δ18o while in monsoon break periods the vapor δ18o increased the underlying reason is that precipitation evaporated vapor has lower δ18o from the high altitude vapor in the cloud while moisture from local evapotranspiration has higher vapor δ18o daily vapor d excess fluctuations are also related to precipitation fig 9b higher precipitation days are roughly in phase with higher vapor d excess the relationships are likely related to the kinetic fractionation during the gradual influence of evaporation of precipitation subsequently reducing the d excess in rainfall and raising the d excess in the evaporated vapor which was also found in the raining season of the middle tp kurita and yamada 2008 to confirm this explanation we also compared the relations between vapor δ18o and d excess during monsoon and non monsoon seasons separately fig 10 the correlation in monsoon season is significant d excess 2 59 δ18o 0 88 r 0 71 p 0 05 while no relationship in non monsoon seasons the robust negative correlation in the monsoon season reflected in fig 10a confirmed that rainfall intensity produced the coherent daily variations of vapor δ18o and d excess statistic shows that vapor d excess in raining days is 18 9 in average 3 3 higher than in the non rain days during the monsoon seasons in 2012 2014 further supporting the idea that the increasing portion of precipitation evaporation to the lower level atmosphere increased vapor d excess the results of this study indicate precipitation evaporation plays an important role in the temporal fluctuations of water vapor d excess in summer monsoon season as a result the strong influence of precipitation evaporation on near surface water vapor δ18o and d excess further complicates the control of vapor isotopes over the tp 5 conclusions this paper discussed the different behaviors of vapor isotopes in monsoon season and non monsoon season based on the measurements of daily water vapor and precipitation isotopes in the southern tp the large seasonal variation of water vapor δ18o is interpreted as a result of large regional atmospheric influence but obviously influenced by isotope fractionation during precipitation evaporation a positive relationship exists between vapor δ18o and large regional air temperatures in non monsoon season implying the underlying mechanism of rayleigh distillation in rainout processes in the monsoon season lower vapor δ18o is weakly in associated with the strong precipitation events over moisture source regions in the tropical indian ocean and over the sampling region on the southern tp as well the simultaneous daily δ18ov and δ18op variations show parallel change and an obvious correlation indicating a general equilibrium between the two phases of water however high frequency fluctuations of vapor δ18o lasting for several days in the monsoon season indicates a notable influence of precipitation events on vapor isotopes an in phase changes of water vapor isotopes with precipitation amounts observed in the monsoon season likely result from the evaporation of precipitation the comparison of δ18ov and δ18op during the observation periods yield a weighted annual difference significantly lower than the equilibrium assumption highlighting the necessary of continuous observation of annual vapor isotopic data in regions with high seasonal precipitation the weak seasonal pattern of vapor d excess varying from year to year is thought to be resulted from climate seasonality over the large moisture sources region however local influence is apparent and the high frequent in phase changes of vapor d excess and precipitation events in monsoon season is resulted from the evaporation of precipitation we also found a seasonal shift of moisture change with a different isotopic footprint moisture sources in summer monsoon season are dominated by supply from the south characterized by a lower water isotopic value while in non monsoon season moisture sources are from west with relatively higher water vapor isotopes we are aware that further work is still necessary for a better understanding of the water vapor isotopes and in particular the control from more other factors we discussed the seasonal control of vapor isotopes influenced by both the large regional atmospheric conditions and the local scale water cycle apparently the local evaporation fractionation modified the observed vapor isotope and hence complicated the controlling on seasonal vapor isotopes our data showed a complex pattern of vapor d excess primarily due to the combined influence of moisture source climate and local influence we also noticed that transpiration and soil evaporation account substantial component in the terrestrial evapotranspiration and therefore influence the atmosphere vapor isotope which was not discussed in

xueyuan road haidian district beijing 100083 china this manuscript was handled by huaming guo editor in chief co2 breakthrough pressure plays an important role in the capacity safety and caprock evaluation of co2 geo sequestration many laboratory experiments have been put forward to investigate the breakthrough pressure and some functional relationships are proposed meanwhile some numerical simulation theories on two phase flow have also been presented by scholars however up to now no numerical simulation method for co2 breakthrough pressure has been put forward in this study a numerical method based on step by step method that can be used to predict co2 breakthrough pressure in rock core is proposed we use comsol multiphysics a numerical simulation software for multiple physical fields to investigate the effects of initial water saturations in rock core on co2 breakthrough pressure the simulation results show that the breakthrough time of co2 are 17 21 37 5 65 and 70 h and the breakthrough pressures of co2 are 1 9 2 2 3 3 5 1 and 5 4 mpa for initial water saturations of 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 and 1 respectively moreover both breakthrough pressure and breakthrough time are exponentially related to the initial water saturation of rock core based on the comparison with the published experimental data it is proved that the breakthrough pressure data of co2 in this numerical simulation is reasonable meanwhile sensitivity studies are conducted on interfacial tensions 20 25 and 30 mn m in co2 h2o system and m 0 3 0 4 and 0 5 l 1 4 1 7 and 2 values in van genuchten vg model the results show that 1 under the condition of high saturation the effect of interfacial tension on breakthrough will be more obvious low interfacial tension in co2 h2o system has an adverse impact on co2 breakthrough the higher the interfacial tension the lower the breakthrough pressure and breakthrough time of co2 2 under the condition of high saturations the influence of parameters m and l in vg model on co2 breakthrough will be more obvious at the same saturation the greater the m l parameters the greater the breakthrough pressure and breakthrough time of co2 this study provides numerical information for further studies of comprehensive and more complex numerical simulations on co2 breakthrough pressure in rock core co2 geo sequestration as well as the caprock evaluation keywords co2 geo sequestration co2 breakthrough pressure initial water saturation rock core scale modeling 1 introduction a major concern during co2 geo sequestration is potential co2 leakage into the atmosphere zhang and yu 2016 zhao and yu 2017 2018 of the various potential co2 reservoirs available deep underground saline aquifers are dominant due to their broad worldwide distribution and huge storage capacity wang et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 li et al 2017 co2 injected into deep saline aquifers is stored in them through various trapping mechanisms bachu 2009 bachu and bennion 2009 ren and jeong 2018 of which stratigraphic and structural trapping begins to play a role in the early stage of co2 injection because the density of co2 in free state is less than that of formation water co2 plumes move upward under buoyancy when encountering impermeable or low permeable strata the migration of co2 is limited and co2 is trapped under the upper well sealed strata however when the accumulated pressure of co2 in reservoir exceeds a certain value co2 can break through capillary pressure of caprock and leak for deep saline aquifers co2 pressure must be sufficient to overcome the capillary pressure of the medium to enter the reservoir pore for low permeability rocks as caprock if co2 pressure exceeds its capillary pressure and begins to pass through the rock pore continuously co2 can break through the caprock and leak at this time the pressure difference between gas phase and liquid phase is called breakthrough pressure tanai et al 2012 rezaeyan et al 2015b li et al 2005 proposed that when the differential pressure across the seal rock overcomes the capillary pressures of a series of interconnected pore throats of arbitrarily large sizes a continuous filament of non wetting phase will be formed and consequently a slow darcy flow will occur this differential pressure is regarded as the breakthrough pressure of the seal rock moreover in the rock core scale experiments of co2 displacement of saturated core breakthrough pressure is considered as the pressure difference between the inlet co2 phase and outlet h2o phase of rock core when the gas bubbles are observed at the end of rock core zhang and yu 2016 zhao and yu 2017 2018 when the breakthrough pressure is greater than the capillary pressure co2 enters the interconnected pore network and gradually displaces the water in the pore until co2 is continuously flowing in the whole system and gradually occupies the dominant position however the degree of water saturation has a significant influence on the displacement process of two phase flow and co2 breakthrough pressure in the existing studies co2 breakthrough process in rocks with different water saturation is often neglected therefore researches on co2 breakthrough pressure under various saturations of water and various phenomena or laws in this process have important guiding significance for practical engineering problems zhao and yu 2017 gas breakthrough experiment is the most direct and effective method to determine gas breakthrough pressure and effective permeability in rock formation thomas et al 1968 schowalter 1979 hildenbrand et al 2002 hildenbrand and krooss 2003 li et al 2005 boulin et al 2013 rezaeyan et al 2015b the measurement methods are mainly divided into direct and indirect methods indirect method deduces gas breakthrough pressure mainly by pore structure measurement methods such as mercury intrusion and gas adsorption the accuracy of this method is slightly poor hildenbrand et al 2013 the direct method includes step by step method continuous method displacement method and impulse method ito et al 2011 the step by step method is to gradually increase the injection pressure of gas at the inlet of the sample until there is gas flow at the outlet which means that the gas breakthrough is successful the pressure difference between gas phase inlet and liquid phase outlet is determined as the breakthrough pressure this method has been widely used by many scholars to measure gas breakthrough pressure because it is based on the definition of breakthrough pressure and has high accuracy schowalter 1979 boulin et al 2013 many scholars have done a lot of work on the breakthrough pressure of gases in rocks for instance hildenbrand et al 2002 measured the breakthrough pressure and effective permeability of fully saturated mudstone and siltstone by pulse breakthrough pressure test hildenbrand et al 2004 selected 26 rock samples of different lithologies for breakthrough pressure test and obtained the relationship between gas absolute permeability and effective permeability as well as permeability and sealing performance of caprock li et al 2005 carried out a step by step breakthrough pressure experiment on the caprock for co2 storage in weyburn oilfield the results show that the breakthrough pressure of co2 in the caprock is as high as 21 mpa which indicates that the caprock has very high sealing performance with regard to the water saturation effects on gas breakthrough pressure zhang and yu 2016 analyzed the ch4 breakthrough pressure of carboniferous shale in qaidam basin under different water saturation and obtained the exponential relationship between breakthrough pressure and water saturation taking the low permeability sandstone in ordos basin as the research object zhao and yu 2017 and zhao and yu 2018 carried out 6 group breakthrough pressure experiments of co2 or co2 ch4 mixtures in rock cores with different water saturations at 40 and 8 5 mpa the relationship between the breakthrough pressure and factors such as mineral composition pore structure water saturation and gas composition were studied basedonthe above research we find that numerical simulation method can also be used to determine the breakthrough pressure of co2 in the absence of experimental conditions or to verify the experimental results however there is still no numerical simulation method among the above methods that can be used to measure gas breakthrough pressure with regard to the numerical simulations on two phase flow in co2 geo sequestration a good deal of studies have been put forward shi et al 2011 conducted a study of a full co2 core flooding and imbibition cycle performed on a tako sandstone core in their simulation of the co2 injection drainage process in a 1d model the parameter m in the van genuchten vg model is 0 425 kuo and benson 2015 provided a numerical study of the fundamental physics of the combined influence of heterogeneity viscous forces gravity and capillarity on multiphase flow of co2 and brine basirat et al 2017 carried out numerical modeling to study the pore scale fluid fluid displacement mechanisms under various wetting conditions and to quantify the effect of wettability on macroscopic parameters they found that the relative permeability of co2 can be significantly lower in strongly water wet conditions than in the intermediate wet conditions perera et al 2013 conducted parametric study to model the effect of co2 injection pressure on cap rock deformation and investigate the possibility of leakage or back migration of co2 to the atmosphere through the cap rock their model can be used to study general coal mass and cap rock behavior and the back movement of co2 flow to the atmosphere according to the field scale model of rathnaweera et al 2017 the long term interaction of co2 causes hawkesbury formation s pore structure to significantly change the study carried out by laurent et al 2014 describes numerical modeling that is able to reproduce the experimental results of drying of brine saturated sandstone cores by gas injection in the laboratory the evolution of water and gas saturation profiles and the precipitation of salt inside the samples are followed with injection time in their study oostrom et al 2016 conducted a comparative study on the performance of empirical models employed for co2 geo sequestration and identified van genuchten vg model as more suitable for supercritical co2 injection simulations however in such numerical methods for calculating two phase flow no method has been adopted to determine the breakthrough pressure of co2 in rock cores in this study we will propose a method that can be used to calculate the co2 breakthrough pressure in rock core in this study a numerical method for modeling co2 breakthrough pressure under various water saturations in rock core is conducted using comsol multiphysics a numerical simulation software for multiple physical fields this is a new study as 1 a numerical method for the study on co2 breakthrough pressure in rock core is proposed 2 this is an attempt to use comsol multiphysics to solve the scientific problems on co2 geo sequestration 3 this study can validate the conclusions of previous practical experiments on co2 breakthrough pressure and sensitive studies on important parameters are performed and 4 this numerical method can contribute to predict co2 breakthrough pressure with various influence factors in rock core scale in the future 2 theory and method comsol multiphysics is a numerical software based on pdes partial differential equations and fem finite element analysis we can use comsol multiphysics to model and solve a wide range of scientific and engineering problems as it can provide the handy interface on fem cfd computational fluid dynamics software package has a module to calculate underground flow in which the two phase flow equation permeability model and capillary pressure model are built in models what we need to do is to input appropriate parameters under this module in this study we use the module of fluid flow porous media and subsurface flow two phase darcy s law to solve the problem of co2 breakthrough pressure in a general porous medium rock core moreover comsol multiphysics does not introduce how to deal with sharp interface between co2 h2o phases however based on the literature of finite element methods for dealing with sharp interfaces liu et al 2010 it can be seen that the sharp interfaces are basically treated by adding additional interface equations as long as there is a set of appropriate parameters and solver numerical stability and mass conservation can be achieved 2 1 theory for the two phase darcy s law darcy s law darcy 1856 proposed his first theory that is considered to be the starting point of the development of the scientific quantitative theory of flow through porous media almost 160 years ago in comsol multiphysics the two phase darcy s law interface is used to simulate fluid flow through interstices in a porous medium the physics interface can be used to model low velocity flows or media where the permeability and porosity are very small for which the pressure gradient is the major driving force according to darcy s law the velocity filed is given by 1 u k μ p in this equation u m s is the darcy velocity vector k m2 is the permeability of the porous medium μ pa s is the fluid s dynamic viscosity which is an interpolation function varying with pressure in this model and p pa is the fluid s pressure the gravity effect of the fluids is neglected refer to 3 1 basic assumption the two phase darcy s law is to combine darcy s law eq 1 with the continuity equation which is 2 ρ ε t ρ u 0 here ρ g cm3 is the average density which is an interpolation function varying with pressure in this model ε is the porosity of rock core t s is time inserting darcy s law eq 1 into the continuity equation eq 2 produces the governing equation 3 ρ ε t ρ k μ p 0 for the displacement process of co2 h2o in a rock core the mass conservation equation for the two phase flow can be obtained by eq 3 in this model the pore water is uniformly distributed in the porous medium originally and the available pore space can be completely filled with two phase fluid at a given time which relates the effective saturations for each phase 4 s 1 s 2 1 5 s 1 ρ 1 s 2 ρ 2 ρ 6 s 1 k r 1 μ 1 s 2 k r 2 μ 2 1 μ here s1 and s2 represent the saturation of each phase ρ1 and ρ2 represent the densities of each phase which are interpolation functions varying with pressure in this model and kr1 and kr2 are the relative permeabilities of each phase 2 2 capillary pressure beside the continuity equation for the mixture eq 3 the two phase darcy s law interface also solves the transport equation for the fluid content of one of the phases 7 c 1 s 1 ρ 1 8 t ε c 1 c 1 u d c c 1 here dc m2 s is the capillary diffusion coefficient which can be directly specified or it can be derived from a capillary pressure expression normally the fluid content c1 will be the concentration of the wetting phase t is the drainage time when capillary pressure is selected as capillary model the capillary diffusion coefficient is computed from the saturation of one of the phases and the capillary pressure 9 d c k r 1 μ 1 k s 1 1 p c s 1 according to the definition li et al 2005 zhao and yu 2017 it can be seen that the breakthrough pressure must overcome capillary pressure of rock before co2 is considered to break through consequently the capillary pressure is defined as a function of saturation pc s1 the capillary pressure can be a user defined expression or it can be derived from van genuchten model for van genuchten model the expression for the capillary pressure as a function of saturation follows the curve a main characteristic of the vg s pc relation is that the wetting fluid is displaced by the non wetting fluid if pc 0 10 p c p ec 1 s 1 1 m 1 1 m where pec is the entry capillary pressure which can be calculated based on the young laplace equation described in the section of 3 2 model description s1 is the effective saturation of h2o and m is the pore distribution index based on oostrom et al 2016 m and l the pore geometry parameters related by m 1 1 l for the van genuchten model the relative permeabilities of the two phases are given by 11 k 1 s 1 l 1 1 s 1 1 m m 2 12 k 2 1 s 1 l l 1 s 1 1 m 2 m where k1 and s1 represent the relative permeability and saturation of h2o while the relative permeability and saturation of co2 is k2 and 1 s1 2 3 pressure and saturation in this simulation the pressure and saturation is used to specify the pressure and fluid volume fractions on a boundary in many cases the distribution of pressure and saturation are known as numbers distributions or expressions involving time t for example enter a value or expression for the pressure p pa and for the saturation fluid 1 s1 a dimensionless number between 0 and 1 the saturation of fluid 2 is then calculated as 13 s 2 1 s 1 14 p p i n t where p in is an interpolation function representing the change of inlet pressure with time 2 4 outlet the boundary pressure at the outlet boundary is specified in this simulation the boundary pressure acts as the outflow interface of h2o and co2 and the governing equation is as follows 15 n d c c 1 0 16 p p o u t where dc is the capillary diffusion m2 s and c1 s1ρ1 is the content of fluid 1 kg m3 p out is the outlet pressure which is defined as 8 5 mpa in table 1 2 5 no flux the no flux is the default boundary condition stating that there is no flow across impervious boundaries the mathematical formulation is 17 n ρ u 0 where n is the vector normal to the boundary 3 numerical simulation details 3 1 basic assumptions 1 assuming that the two phase flow in rock core is controlled by darcy s law and this rock core is homogeneous and isotropic based on the conventional mercury injection measurements and the fe sem micro images of the sandstone samples used in zhao and yu 2017 the rock core is homogeneous and isotropic without micro fractures 2 no consideration of the hydrophilic properties of mineral particles of the rock core 3 two phase fluids are assumed to be immiscible as the rock core is placed horizontally in the actual experiments the entrance is on the left side and the exit is on the right side the two phase fluids move along the axis and the gravity effect which is perpendicular to the direction of fluid flow does not have a significant impact on the experimental results therefore the gravity effect is neglected 4 it is assumed that the compressibility of two phases is not considered as the compressibility is not the key factor that influencing the primary drainage process in co2 h2o system li and yu 2014 li et al 2015 5 to study the effects of initial water saturation on co2 breakthrough pressure in particular it is assumed that the interfacial tensions of co2 h2o system and the contact angles of co2 h2o rock system both of which can also influence the displacement process do not vary with the change of pressure the two values are constant however the interfacial tension and contact angle effects on co2 breakthrough pressure will be considered in a future study with comprehensive and more complex models 3 2 model description in this study the geometric model of rock core is modeled by two dimensional axisymmetry fig 1 which can be matched with the model in practical experiments as the rock sample in the experiments is basically a cylindrical three dimensional model the length and the radius of rock core are 16 68 and 12 5 mm respectively the symmetrical axis is on the left the no flux boundary is on the right which means that there is no fluid flowing out from this boundary and the fluids flow along the axis the upper side is the pressure and saturation boundary and the lower side is the outlet for mesh generation the mapping mesh which belongs to fine mesh is used the initial water saturations in this rock core are 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 and 1 respectively super critical co2 is injected from the upper side of the model to displace pure water no consideration of gravity effect and the pressure at the inlet increases gradually pure water is displaced in the form of pushing drainage pattern described by li and yu 2014 and li et al 2015 and flows out of the rock core from the lower side until the water saturation at the outlet begins to slightly decline it is considered that there is a co2 spill that is to say the breakthrough of co2 is achieved at this point the pressure difference between the inlet and outlet i e the pressure difference between the gas phase and the liquid phase is the breakthrough pressure of co2 zhao and yu 2017 parameters of this model are set as table 1 the values of porosity permeability average pore diameter and outlet pressure are all set with reference to the practical co2 breakthrough experiments conducted by zhao and yu 2017 and are adjusted appropriately it is worth mentioning that overburden pressure is a controlling component in the gas breakthrough experiment as the effective stress changes the pore structure leading to reduction in permeability however the decrease pathways for co2 to flow in the presence of water appropriately brine would affect capillary pressure thus co2 breakthrough pressure ghanizadeh et al 2014 rezaeyan et al 2015a based on this consideration the value of permeability adopted in this model is the permeability measured after the overburden pressure is applied to the rock in the experiments of zhao and yu 2017 simultaneously the no flux boundary eq 17 is added around the porous media except for inlet and outlet which means that there is no fluid flowing out from this boundary and the fluids flow along the axis the interfacial tension and the contact angle are set with reference to li et al 2017 and liu et al 2017 both of which are assumed to be constant the values are applicable to the case where the temperature is 40 and the pressure is 8 5 mpa to ensure that co2 is in super critical state to facilitate a special numerical study of the effects of initial saturations on co2 breakthrough pressure the value of entry capillary pressure p is calculated according to the young laplace equation li et al 2015 as follow 18 p 2 γ cos θ r where γ is the interfacial tension ift in co2 h2o system θ is the contact angle in co2 h2o rock system and r is the average pore radius of the rock the constitutive relation constants of m and l reflected in eqs 10 11 and 12 are determined based on the studies of xu et al 2014 oostrom et al 2016 and onoja et al 2019 according to xu et al 2014 for tight fine and inequigranular sandstone reservoirs the values of m are 0 30 0 45 and 0 60 respectively in the study of oostrom et al 2016 one of the values for m in berea sandstone is 0 464 as proposed by onoja et al 2019 from claystone to coarse sandstone the values of l range from 1 10 to 3 00 because of the tight sandstone used in zhao and yu 2017 the value of m is determined as 0 3 corresponding l 1 4 in addition the density and dynamic viscosity values for two phase fluids both of which vary with the change of pressure are input by interpolation and are based on the data given by the website of https webbook nist gov chemistry fluid moreover sensitive studies on the parameters of interfacial tension ift m and l are performed in the section of 4 results and discussion in the 5 sets of simulations initial water saturations of 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 and 1 respectively pressure imposed on the inlet is defined in the form of an interpolation function p in t moreover the pressure equilibrium time and pressure increment of co2 injection in the simulation is based on the step by step method which is consistent with the method proposed by zhao and yu 2017 and chinese oil and gas industry professional standard sy t 5748 2013 in addition the slip effect has been taken into account in all the simulations the slip effect is also known as the klinkenberg effect the low speed percolation characteristics of gas in porous media of rock are different from that of liquid gas does not produce adsorptive thin layer at the pore wall of rock and the velocity of gas molecule has no obvious difference between the center and the wall of pore this characteristic is called slip effect moreover when the pressure is very low the average free path of the gas molecule reaches the pore size and the gas molecule diffusion can fly freely without collision which leads to the increase of apparent permeability the lower the permeability of rock the more obvious the slip effect the lower the pressure the more obvious the slip effect the modified parameter is set in the model parameter table as 1 0 251 pa kappa0 1 m 2 0 36 p klinkenberg 1941 hu et al 2009 in addition adsorption capacity of the porous media can also lead to slip flow however research on adsorption is usually carried out in organic rich shale or for shale gas production shabro et al 2011 gasparik et al 2014a b moreover the rock core used in zhao and yu 2017 is sandstone with quartz as the main mineral there are no organic matter and clay minerals according to their analysis adsorption does not play a role in co2 breakthrough process so adsorption is not taken into account in this numerical simulation 4 results and discussion 4 1 results on the determination of co2 breakthrough time and breakthrough pressure we selected three points in rock core named a b and c as shown in fig 2 a according to li and yu 2014 and li et al 2015 the primary drainage process during co2 injected into deep saline aquifers can be divided into three stages the first stage is the pushing drainage stage also known as piston drainage stage during which most of the pore water can be drained out by super critical co2 until co2 escapes from the outlet of the rock core in the 5 sets of simulations residual water saturations at the inlet point a decrease obviously at the beginning of displacement as shown by the red lines in fig 2 b f point b is in the center of rock core residual water saturations at this point remain unchanged some may even rise slightly due to the accumulation of water during the drainage process until co2 reaches to this point and then decreases the blue lines in figures point c which is the key point to determine co2 breakthrough time is at the outlet of rock core residual water saturations at this point remain unchanged for a long time until co2 breaks through this rock core shown as green lines in figures moreover the higher the initial water saturation is the longer the residual water saturation at point c remains unchanged that is the longer time for co2 to break through the rock core each curve in the graphs contains continuous data it is worth pointing out that the breakthrough time is not determined according to the obvious inflection point of curve c but according to the slight decrease of residual water saturation at point c which is consistent with the determination of breakthrough point in the practical experiments a small number of gas bubbles emerged at the outlet and the residual water decreased slightly that is to say the residual water saturation at point c decreases slightly which means that co2 breaks through the rock core therefore co2 breakthrough time can be derived from the curves of fig 2 they are 17 21 37 5 65 and 70 h for initial water saturations of 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 and 1 respectively based on the above we can determine the final form of co2 pressurization at the inlet for 5 sets of simulations fig 3 as for co2 breakthrough pressure in the 5 sets of simulations it can be derived from figs 3 and 4 fig 4 is the 3d color map of pressure in rock core over time since the pressure at the outlet the pressure of liquid phase is preset to 8 5 mpa the pressure at the inlet the pressure of gas phase is gradually increasing from 8 5 mpa in the 5 sets of simulations the higher the initial water saturation of the rock core the greater the pressure in rock core at the breakthrough time according to the calculation results of the model co2 breakthrough pressures at 5 breakthrough times are 1 9 2 2 3 3 5 1 and 5 4 mpa for initial water saturations of 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 and 1 in rock core respectively the co2 breakthrough pressure is the difference between the inlet gas phase and the outlet liquid phase pressure which is consistent with the definition of breakthrough pressure mentioned in li et al 2005 and zhao and yu 2017 4 2 discussion based on the calculation results of co2 breakthrough pressure and time we established correlations between the breakthrough pressure time and initial water saturation shown in fig 5 it can be seen from fig 5 a that we found an exponential relationship between the breakthrough pressure and the initial water saturation which is exactly the same as what zhao and yu 2017 described in their practical co2 breakthrough experiments that is 19 p a e b s where p is the breakthrough pressure s is the initial water saturation when the initial water saturation s 0 the breakthrough pressure p is equal to a moreover a is related to the average pore radius b is related to the absolute permeability of the rock core and a zhao and yu 2017 please refer to zhao and yu 2017 for more detailed information on parameters a and b in this study a 1 3621 and b 1 4649 the coefficient of determination r2 is 0 9527 which demonstrates that the relationship is reasonable meanwhile we also found an exponential relationship between the breakthrough time and the initial water saturation which is not revealed in previous experimental studies as shown in fig 5 b which can be described as 20 t c e d s where t is the breakthrough time c 10 989 and d 1 9802 in this study the coefficient of determination r2 is 0 9527 showing that the exponential relationship is reasonable based on this equation when s 0 the breakthrough time t is equal to c however the factors that influencing parameters c and d and their properties are not clarified in the experimental study of zhao and yu 2017 they still need to be determined by a large number of practical experiments in the future in order to verify the accuracy of this simulation results we selected the experimental results of no 4 rock core the parameters of which are the closest to those in this simulation from the study of zhao and yu 2017 to compare with the simulation results as shown in fig 6 from fig 6 it can be seen that the breakthrough pressure of co2 in rock core varies exponentially with the increase of initial water saturation both in experimental and in simulation results in the case of high saturations the simulation results are very close to the experimental ones when the saturation is 1 the two results basically coincide the experiments cannot achieve integer and regular initial water saturation and there are many factors affecting the co2 breakthrough process in practical experiments meanwhile we only consider the effects of initial saturation on breakthrough pressure in this simulation so the simulation data at low saturation are slightly different from the experimental data the overall trend of the experimental data is consistent with that of the simulation and the simulation results are considered to be reasonable and feasible nevertheless we will conduct more complex models which will take into account factors such as interfacial tension contact angle and complex network with micro fractures in the future to further study the comprehensive influence mechanism of various factors on co2 breakthrough pressure for instance liu et al 2017 proposed a model numbered as eq 9 in their study which concludes that variation in ift is related to parameters including but not limited to temperature pressure and salinity based on their model we are trying to conduct a numerical simulation of the effects of the above factors on co2 breakthrough pressure in practical co2 geo sequestration engineering the sealing ability of caprock can also be characterized by the effective permeability after co2 breakthrough the effective permeability is also a key parameter to control co2 migration ability in porous media effective permeability depends on co2 water saturation in pore horseman et al 1999 wollenweber et al 2010 in addition the change of initial water saturation in rocks will affect the gas flow characteristics previous experimental studies on tight sandstone show that the effective permeability of gas decreases significantly with the increase of water saturation thomas et al 1972 byrnes et al 1979 walls et al 1982 rushing et al 2003 however in the field of co2 geo sequestration the research on gas breakthrough pressure and permeability of unsaturated rock is limited zhao and yu 2017 zhao and yu 2018 the curves of effective permeability or relative permeability for two phase fluids can be derived based on the simulation as shown in fig 7 the blue line represents water phase and the green line represents co2 phase for the variation of effective permeability of two phase fluids with initial water saturation in fig 7 a it can be derived that the effective permeability of water increases and the effective permeability of co2 decreases with the increase of initial water saturation in rock core when the initial water saturation in the core is 1 the effective permeability of water can reach the absolute permeability of rock core i e 2 10 6 md when the water saturation in the core is 0 the effective permeability of co2 can also reach the absolute permeability of the core for the relative permeability of two phase fluids fig 7 b f it can be seen that the larger the initial water saturation in rock core the smaller the initial relative permeability of co2 and the larger the initial relative permeability of water however with the operation of the calculation as displacement proceeds the relative permeability of co2 increases gradually until it reaches its maximum while the relative permeability of water decreases gradually until it reaches its minimum finally the relative permeability of each phase can reach the same value in the 5 simulations it demonstrates that the main factor leading to the difference of calculation results is the initial water saturation when the water saturation reaches to the lowest value the displacement characteristics of two phase flow in the 5 simulations are completely consistent this is also considered that with the increase of time most of the water in the core is dried out and the pore space is basically occupied by co2 4 3 sensitive study there are many parameters involved in the breakthrough process of supercritical co2 at rock core scale at present the simulation of the influences of temperature ion concentration and other related factors on the breakthrough process is still in progress and the orthogonal test of multi parameter sensitivity cannot be designed therefore the sensitivity study of breakthrough simulation under different saturations only considers two parameters in this study namely different interfacial tensions ift in co2 h2o system and different values of m l in vg model 4 3 1 effect of interfacial tensions ift on co2 breakthrough pressure table 2 shows that when m 0 3 and l 1 4 the interfacial tensions of 20 25 and 30 mn m are simulated to study the influence of different interfacial tensions on co2 breakthrough when the saturation is low taking saturation of 0 2 as an example the longest breakthrough time is 18 h at 20 mn m and the shortest breakthrough time is 16 5 h at 30 mn m the difference between them is only 1 5 h and the difference of breakthrough pressures is only 0 2 mpa when the saturation increases gradually the influence of interfacial tension is gradually reflected when the saturation is 1 the longest breakthrough time is 87 h at 20 mn m the shortest breakthrough time is 68 5 h at 30 mn m the difference is 18 5 h and the difference of breakthrough pressures is 1 2 mpa therefore under the condition of high saturation the effect of interfacial tension on breakthrough will be more obvious when the interfacial tension is at a low level of 20 mn m with the saturation gradient of 0 2 increasing gradually the breakthrough time increases rapidly the breakthrough time is prolonged by 13 8 h for each increase of average saturation by 0 2 when the interfacial tension increases to 25 mn m the growth rate of breakthrough time decreases when the interfacial tension increases 0 2 the breakthrough time prolongs by 10 6 h on average when the interfacial tension is 30 mn m the growth rate of breakthrough time is close to that of 25 mn m which is 10 4 h it shows that low interfacial tension has an adverse impact on breakthrough the higher the interfacial tension the lower the breakthrough time pressure therefore the interfacial tension is deduced to have a limitation beyond which its impact on breakthrough time and pressure will become smaller 4 3 2 effect of m l values on co2 breakthrough pressure pore distribution index m is a parameter used to characterize the bending degree of saturation characteristic curve also known as shape parameter it decreases with the increase of burial depth and rock density the relationship between parameters l and m is m 1 1 l oostrom et al 2016 so there is only one independent variable m in sensitivity study of m l table 3 shows the values of m 0 3 0 4 and 0 5 when the interfacial tension is 25 mn m in order to study the influence of different values of m l on co2 breakthrough when saturation is low take saturation of 0 2 as an example under three different m values the longest breakthrough time is 27 5 h at m 0 5 and the shortest breakthrough time is 17 h at m 0 3 the difference between them is 10 5 h and the difference of breakthrough pressure is 0 8 mpa when saturation increases gradually the influence of m l gradually manifests when saturation is 1 the longest breakthrough time is 135 h at m 0 5 and the shortest breakthrough time is 70 h at m 0 3 the difference between them is 65 h and the difference of breakthrough pressures is 3 6 mpa therefore under the condition of high saturations the influence of m l on breakthrough will be more obvious under the same saturation condition the larger the m value the lower the gas permeability in the rock core and the greater the breakthrough time pressure 5 conclusion the study of migration accumulation and breakthrough process of co2 in rocks is of great significance for co2 geo sequestration on the one hand rock is the main medium and geological environment for underground fluid flow on the other hand the caprock determines the storage capacity and safety of co2 therefore it is necessary to investigate and reveal the breakthrough pressure of co2 in rocks large numbers of laboratory experiments have been carried out to investigate the mechanisms of co2 breakthrough pressure and many studies have proposed the functional relationship between breakthrough pressure and various influencing factors however these functional relationships are not accurate enough as they are also influenced by other inevitable factors therefore it is urgent to carry out relevant numerical simulation to investigate the impact of a specific factor on co2 breakthrough pressure unfortunately there has been no relevant research so far meanwhile many scholars have also carried out a large number of numerical simulation studies on two phase flow in co2 geo sequestration and many numerical theories have been proposed however there is no numerical simulation study on the breakthrough pressure of co2 in rock cores this is the first attempt to use comsol multiphysics to simulate the co2 breakthrough pressure in a porous medium rock core with different initial water saturations to reveal the effect of initial water saturation which is the single and specific factor on co2 breakthrough pressure in this study a numerical method for studying co2 breakthrough pressure in rock core with various initial water saturations has been proposed based on the step by step method because the rock core is homogeneous and isotropic and water is evenly distributed in the core supercritical co2 displacing water is mainly in a pushing drainage pattern li and yu 2014 li et al 2015 the determination of breakthrough time is based on the slight decrease of water saturation at the outlet of rock core breakthrough pressure is the difference between inlet co2 phase and outlet h2o phase pressures of rock core at the breakthrough time this method is consistent with the method used in the practical co2 breakthrough pressure experiments zhao and yu 2017 in this rock core scale numerical modeling co2 breakthrough times are 17 21 37 5 65 and 70 h similarly co2 breakthrough pressures are 1 9 2 2 3 3 5 1 and 5 4 mpa for initial water saturations of 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 and 1 respectively an exponential function relationship between co2 breakthrough pressure and initial water saturation is established that is p aebs where a 1 362 and b 1 4649 in this study r2 0 9527 indicating that this exponential relationship is reasonable without considering the influence of other factors on co2 breakthrough pressure meanwhile an exponential function relationship between co2 breakthrough time and initial water saturation is also established that is t ceds where c 10 989 and d 1 9802 in this study r2 0 9527 which also proves that the exponential relationship is reasonable however this function has not been explained in experimental studies moreover the experimental data and simulative data of breakthrough pressure are compared and analyzed in this study from the analysis results it is found that the higher the initial water saturation the better the agreement between the experimental data and the simulation ones the overall trend of the experimental data is consistent with that of the simulation which proves that the simulation results are reasonable and feasible sensitivity studies are conducted on key parameters of interfacial tensions 20 25 and 30 mn m in co2 h2o system and m 0 3 0 4 and 0 5 l 1 4 1 7 and 2 values in vg model the results show that 1 under the condition of high saturation the effect of interfacial tension on breakthrough will be more obvious low interfacial tension in co2 h2o system has an adverse impact on co2 breakthrough the higher the interfacial tension the lower the breakthrough pressure and breakthrough time of co2 2 under the condition of high saturations the influence of parameters m and l in vg model on co2 breakthrough will be more obvious at the same saturation the greater the m l parameters the greater the breakthrough pressure and breakthrough time of co2 based on this study the influences of other parameters and their combined effects on co2 breakthrough pressure can also be investigated by comprehensive and more complex numerical models in the future this study can help to select the aquifer with more suitable water saturation for co2

xueyuan road haidian district beijing 100083 china this manuscript was handled by huaming guo editor in chief co2 breakthrough pressure plays an important role in the capacity safety and caprock evaluation of co2 geo sequestration many laboratory experiments have been put forward to investigate the breakthrough pressure and some functional relationships are proposed meanwhile some numerical simulation theories on two phase flow have also been presented by scholars however up to now no numerical simulation method for co2 breakthrough pressure has been put forward in this study a numerical method based on step by step method that can be used to predict co2 breakthrough pressure in rock core is proposed we use comsol multiphysics a numerical simulation software for multiple physical fields to investigate the effects of initial water saturations in rock core on co2 breakthrough pressure the simulation results show that the breakthrough time of co2 are 17 21 37 5 65 and 70 h and the breakthrough pressures of co2 are 1 9 2 2 3 3 5 1 and 5 4 mpa for initial water saturations of 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 and 1 respectively moreover both breakthrough pressure and breakthrough time are exponentially related to the initial water saturation of rock core based on the comparison with the published experimental data it is proved that the breakthrough pressure data of co2 in this numerical simulation is reasonable meanwhile sensitivity studies are conducted on interfacial tensions 20 25 and 30 mn m in co2 h2o system and m 0 3 0 4 and 0 5 l 1 4 1 7 and 2 values in van genuchten vg model the results show that 1 under the condition of high saturation the effect of interfacial tension on breakthrough will be more obvious low interfacial tension in co2 h2o system has an adverse impact on co2 breakthrough the higher the interfacial tension the lower the breakthrough pressure and breakthrough time of co2 2 under the condition of high saturations the influence of parameters m and l in vg model on co2 breakthrough will be more obvious at the same saturation the greater the m l parameters the greater the breakthrough pressure and breakthrough time of co2 this study provides numerical information for further studies of comprehensive and more complex numerical simulations on co2 breakthrough pressure in rock core co2 geo sequestration as well as the caprock evaluation keywords co2 geo sequestration co2 breakthrough pressure initial water saturation rock core scale modeling 1 introduction a major concern during co2 geo sequestration is potential co2 leakage into the atmosphere zhang and yu 2016 zhao and yu 2017 2018 of the various potential co2 reservoirs available deep underground saline aquifers are dominant due to their broad worldwide distribution and huge storage capacity wang et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 li et al 2017 co2 injected into deep saline aquifers is stored in them through various trapping mechanisms bachu 2009 bachu and bennion 2009 ren and jeong 2018 of which stratigraphic and structural trapping begins to play a role in the early stage of co2 injection because the density of co2 in free state is less than that of formation water co2 plumes move upward under buoyancy when encountering impermeable or low permeable strata the migration of co2 is limited and co2 is trapped under the upper well sealed strata however when the accumulated pressure of co2 in reservoir exceeds a certain value co2 can break through capillary pressure of caprock and leak for deep saline aquifers co2 pressure must be sufficient to overcome the capillary pressure of the medium to enter the reservoir pore for low permeability rocks as caprock if co2 pressure exceeds its capillary pressure and begins to pass through the rock pore continuously co2 can break through the caprock and leak at this time the pressure difference between gas phase and liquid phase is called breakthrough pressure tanai et al 2012 rezaeyan et al 2015b li et al 2005 proposed that when the differential pressure across the seal rock overcomes the capillary pressures of a series of interconnected pore throats of arbitrarily large sizes a continuous filament of non wetting phase will be formed and consequently a slow darcy flow will occur this differential pressure is regarded as the breakthrough pressure of the seal rock moreover in the rock core scale experiments of co2 displacement of saturated core breakthrough pressure is considered as the pressure difference between the inlet co2 phase and outlet h2o phase of rock core when the gas bubbles are observed at the end of rock core zhang and yu 2016 zhao and yu 2017 2018 when the breakthrough pressure is greater than the capillary pressure co2 enters the interconnected pore network and gradually displaces the water in the pore until co2 is continuously flowing in the whole system and gradually occupies the dominant position however the degree of water saturation has a significant influence on the displacement process of two phase flow and co2 breakthrough pressure in the existing studies co2 breakthrough process in rocks with different water saturation is often neglected therefore researches on co2 breakthrough pressure under various saturations of water and various phenomena or laws in this process have important guiding significance for practical engineering problems zhao and yu 2017 gas breakthrough experiment is the most direct and effective method to determine gas breakthrough pressure and effective permeability in rock formation thomas et al 1968 schowalter 1979 hildenbrand et al 2002 hildenbrand and krooss 2003 li et al 2005 boulin et al 2013 rezaeyan et al 2015b the measurement methods are mainly divided into direct and indirect methods indirect method deduces gas breakthrough pressure mainly by pore structure measurement methods such as mercury intrusion and gas adsorption the accuracy of this method is slightly poor hildenbrand et al 2013 the direct method includes step by step method continuous method displacement method and impulse method ito et al 2011 the step by step method is to gradually increase the injection pressure of gas at the inlet of the sample until there is gas flow at the outlet which means that the gas breakthrough is successful the pressure difference between gas phase inlet and liquid phase outlet is determined as the breakthrough pressure this method has been widely used by many scholars to measure gas breakthrough pressure because it is based on the definition of breakthrough pressure and has high accuracy schowalter 1979 boulin et al 2013 many scholars have done a lot of work on the breakthrough pressure of gases in rocks for instance hildenbrand et al 2002 measured the breakthrough pressure and effective permeability of fully saturated mudstone and siltstone by pulse breakthrough pressure test hildenbrand et al 2004 selected 26 rock samples of different lithologies for breakthrough pressure test and obtained the relationship between gas absolute permeability and effective permeability as well as permeability and sealing performance of caprock li et al 2005 carried out a step by step breakthrough pressure experiment on the caprock for co2 storage in weyburn oilfield the results show that the breakthrough pressure of co2 in the caprock is as high as 21 mpa which indicates that the caprock has very high sealing performance with regard to the water saturation effects on gas breakthrough pressure zhang and yu 2016 analyzed the ch4 breakthrough pressure of carboniferous shale in qaidam basin under different water saturation and obtained the exponential relationship between breakthrough pressure and water saturation taking the low permeability sandstone in ordos basin as the research object zhao and yu 2017 and zhao and yu 2018 carried out 6 group breakthrough pressure experiments of co2 or co2 ch4 mixtures in rock cores with different water saturations at 40 and 8 5 mpa the relationship between the breakthrough pressure and factors such as mineral composition pore structure water saturation and gas composition were studied basedonthe above research we find that numerical simulation method can also be used to determine the breakthrough pressure of co2 in the absence of experimental conditions or to verify the experimental results however there is still no numerical simulation method among the above methods that can be used to measure gas breakthrough pressure with regard to the numerical simulations on two phase flow in co2 geo sequestration a good deal of studies have been put forward shi et al 2011 conducted a study of a full co2 core flooding and imbibition cycle performed on a tako sandstone core in their simulation of the co2 injection drainage process in a 1d model the parameter m in the van genuchten vg model is 0 425 kuo and benson 2015 provided a numerical study of the fundamental physics of the combined influence of heterogeneity viscous forces gravity and capillarity on multiphase flow of co2 and brine basirat et al 2017 carried out numerical modeling to study the pore scale fluid fluid displacement mechanisms under various wetting conditions and to quantify the effect of wettability on macroscopic parameters they found that the relative permeability of co2 can be significantly lower in strongly water wet conditions than in the intermediate wet conditions perera et al 2013 conducted parametric study to model the effect of co2 injection pressure on cap rock deformation and investigate the possibility of leakage or back migration of co2 to the atmosphere through the cap rock their model can be used to study general coal mass and cap rock behavior and the back movement of co2 flow to the atmosphere according to the field scale model of rathnaweera et al 2017 the long term interaction of co2 causes hawkesbury formation s pore structure to significantly change the study carried out by laurent et al 2014 describes numerical modeling that is able to reproduce the experimental results of drying of brine saturated sandstone cores by gas injection in the laboratory the evolution of water and gas saturation profiles and the precipitation of salt inside the samples are followed with injection time in their study oostrom et al 2016 conducted a comparative study on the performance of empirical models employed for co2 geo sequestration and identified van genuchten vg model as more suitable for supercritical co2 injection simulations however in such numerical methods for calculating two phase flow no method has been adopted to determine the breakthrough pressure of co2 in rock cores in this study we will propose a method that can be used to calculate the co2 breakthrough pressure in rock core in this study a numerical method for modeling co2 breakthrough pressure under various water saturations in rock core is conducted using comsol multiphysics a numerical simulation software for multiple physical fields this is a new study as 1 a numerical method for the study on co2 breakthrough pressure in rock core is proposed 2 this is an attempt to use comsol multiphysics to solve the scientific problems on co2 geo sequestration 3 this study can validate the conclusions of previous practical experiments on co2 breakthrough pressure and sensitive studies on important parameters are performed and 4 this numerical method can contribute to predict co2 breakthrough pressure with various influence factors in rock core scale in the future 2 theory and method comsol multiphysics is a numerical software based on pdes partial differential equations and fem finite element analysis we can use comsol multiphysics to model and solve a wide range of scientific and engineering problems as it can provide the handy interface on fem cfd computational fluid dynamics software package has a module to calculate underground flow in which the two phase flow equation permeability model and capillary pressure model are built in models what we need to do is to input appropriate parameters under this module in this study we use the module of fluid flow porous media and subsurface flow two phase darcy s law to solve the problem of co2 breakthrough pressure in a general porous medium rock core moreover comsol multiphysics does not introduce how to deal with sharp interface between co2 h2o phases however based on the literature of finite element methods for dealing with sharp interfaces liu et al 2010 it can be seen that the sharp interfaces are basically treated by adding additional interface equations as long as there is a set of appropriate parameters and solver numerical stability and mass conservation can be achieved 2 1 theory for the two phase darcy s law darcy s law darcy 1856 proposed his first theory that is considered to be the starting point of the development of the scientific quantitative theory of flow through porous media almost 160 years ago in comsol multiphysics the two phase darcy s law interface is used to simulate fluid flow through interstices in a porous medium the physics interface can be used to model low velocity flows or media where the permeability and porosity are very small for which the pressure gradient is the major driving force according to darcy s law the velocity filed is given by 1 u k μ p in this equation u m s is the darcy velocity vector k m2 is the permeability of the porous medium μ pa s is the fluid s dynamic viscosity which is an interpolation function varying with pressure in this model and p pa is the fluid s pressure the gravity effect of the fluids is neglected refer to 3 1 basic assumption the two phase darcy s law is to combine darcy s law eq 1 with the continuity equation which is 2 ρ ε t ρ u 0 here ρ g cm3 is the average density which is an interpolation function varying with pressure in this model ε is the porosity of rock core t s is time inserting darcy s law eq 1 into the continuity equation eq 2 produces the governing equation 3 ρ ε t ρ k μ p 0 for the displacement process of co2 h2o in a rock core the mass conservation equation for the two phase flow can be obtained by eq 3 in this model the pore water is uniformly distributed in the porous medium originally and the available pore space can be completely filled with two phase fluid at a given time which relates the effective saturations for each phase 4 s 1 s 2 1 5 s 1 ρ 1 s 2 ρ 2 ρ 6 s 1 k r 1 μ 1 s 2 k r 2 μ 2 1 μ here s1 and s2 represent the saturation of each phase ρ1 and ρ2 represent the densities of each phase which are interpolation functions varying with pressure in this model and kr1 and kr2 are the relative permeabilities of each phase 2 2 capillary pressure beside the continuity equation for the mixture eq 3 the two phase darcy s law interface also solves the transport equation for the fluid content of one of the phases 7 c 1 s 1 ρ 1 8 t ε c 1 c 1 u d c c 1 here dc m2 s is the capillary diffusion coefficient which can be directly specified or it can be derived from a capillary pressure expression normally the fluid content c1 will be the concentration of the wetting phase t is the drainage time when capillary pressure is selected as capillary model the capillary diffusion coefficient is computed from the saturation of one of the phases and the capillary pressure 9 d c k r 1 μ 1 k s 1 1 p c s 1 according to the definition li et al 2005 zhao and yu 2017 it can be seen that the breakthrough pressure must overcome capillary pressure of rock before co2 is considered to break through consequently the capillary pressure is defined as a function of saturation pc s1 the capillary pressure can be a user defined expression or it can be derived from van genuchten model for van genuchten model the expression for the capillary pressure as a function of saturation follows the curve a main characteristic of the vg s pc relation is that the wetting fluid is displaced by the non wetting fluid if pc 0 10 p c p ec 1 s 1 1 m 1 1 m where pec is the entry capillary pressure which can be calculated based on the young laplace equation described in the section of 3 2 model description s1 is the effective saturation of h2o and m is the pore distribution index based on oostrom et al 2016 m and l the pore geometry parameters related by m 1 1 l for the van genuchten model the relative permeabilities of the two phases are given by 11 k 1 s 1 l 1 1 s 1 1 m m 2 12 k 2 1 s 1 l l 1 s 1 1 m 2 m where k1 and s1 represent the relative permeability and saturation of h2o while the relative permeability and saturation of co2 is k2 and 1 s1 2 3 pressure and saturation in this simulation the pressure and saturation is used to specify the pressure and fluid volume fractions on a boundary in many cases the distribution of pressure and saturation are known as numbers distributions or expressions involving time t for example enter a value or expression for the pressure p pa and for the saturation fluid 1 s1 a dimensionless number between 0 and 1 the saturation of fluid 2 is then calculated as 13 s 2 1 s 1 14 p p i n t where p in is an interpolation function representing the change of inlet pressure with time 2 4 outlet the boundary pressure at the outlet boundary is specified in this simulation the boundary pressure acts as the outflow interface of h2o and co2 and the governing equation is as follows 15 n d c c 1 0 16 p p o u t where dc is the capillary diffusion m2 s and c1 s1ρ1 is the content of fluid 1 kg m3 p out is the outlet pressure which is defined as 8 5 mpa in table 1 2 5 no flux the no flux is the default boundary condition stating that there is no flow across impervious boundaries the mathematical formulation is 17 n ρ u 0 where n is the vector normal to the boundary 3 numerical simulation details 3 1 basic assumptions 1 assuming that the two phase flow in rock core is controlled by darcy s law and this rock core is homogeneous and isotropic based on the conventional mercury injection measurements and the fe sem micro images of the sandstone samples used in zhao and yu 2017 the rock core is homogeneous and isotropic without micro fractures 2 no consideration of the hydrophilic properties of mineral particles of the rock core 3 two phase fluids are assumed to be immiscible as the rock core is placed horizontally in the actual experiments the entrance is on the left side and the exit is on the right side the two phase fluids move along the axis and the gravity effect which is perpendicular to the direction of fluid flow does not have a significant impact on the experimental results therefore the gravity effect is neglected 4 it is assumed that the compressibility of two phases is not considered as the compressibility is not the key factor that influencing the primary drainage process in co2 h2o system li and yu 2014 li et al 2015 5 to study the effects of initial water saturation on co2 breakthrough pressure in particular it is assumed that the interfacial tensions of co2 h2o system and the contact angles of co2 h2o rock system both of which can also influence the displacement process do not vary with the change of pressure the two values are constant however the interfacial tension and contact angle effects on co2 breakthrough pressure will be considered in a future study with comprehensive and more complex models 3 2 model description in this study the geometric model of rock core is modeled by two dimensional axisymmetry fig 1 which can be matched with the model in practical experiments as the rock sample in the experiments is basically a cylindrical three dimensional model the length and the radius of rock core are 16 68 and 12 5 mm respectively the symmetrical axis is on the left the no flux boundary is on the right which means that there is no fluid flowing out from this boundary and the fluids flow along the axis the upper side is the pressure and saturation boundary and the lower side is the outlet for mesh generation the mapping mesh which belongs to fine mesh is used the initial water saturations in this rock core are 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 and 1 respectively super critical co2 is injected from the upper side of the model to displace pure water no consideration of gravity effect and the pressure at the inlet increases gradually pure water is displaced in the form of pushing drainage pattern described by li and yu 2014 and li et al 2015 and flows out of the rock core from the lower side until the water saturation at the outlet begins to slightly decline it is considered that there is a co2 spill that is to say the breakthrough of co2 is achieved at this point the pressure difference between the inlet and outlet i e the pressure difference between the gas phase and the liquid phase is the breakthrough pressure of co2 zhao and yu 2017 parameters of this model are set as table 1 the values of porosity permeability average pore diameter and outlet pressure are all set with reference to the practical co2 breakthrough experiments conducted by zhao and yu 2017 and are adjusted appropriately it is worth mentioning that overburden pressure is a controlling component in the gas breakthrough experiment as the effective stress changes the pore structure leading to reduction in permeability however the decrease pathways for co2 to flow in the presence of water appropriately brine would affect capillary pressure thus co2 breakthrough pressure ghanizadeh et al 2014 rezaeyan et al 2015a based on this consideration the value of permeability adopted in this model is the permeability measured after the overburden pressure is applied to the rock in the experiments of zhao and yu 2017 simultaneously the no flux boundary eq 17 is added around the porous media except for inlet and outlet which means that there is no fluid flowing out from this boundary and the fluids flow along the axis the interfacial tension and the contact angle are set with reference to li et al 2017 and liu et al 2017 both of which are assumed to be constant the values are applicable to the case where the temperature is 40 and the pressure is 8 5 mpa to ensure that co2 is in super critical state to facilitate a special numerical study of the effects of initial saturations on co2 breakthrough pressure the value of entry capillary pressure p is calculated according to the young laplace equation li et al 2015 as follow 18 p 2 γ cos θ r where γ is the interfacial tension ift in co2 h2o system θ is the contact angle in co2 h2o rock system and r is the average pore radius of the rock the constitutive relation constants of m and l reflected in eqs 10 11 and 12 are determined based on the studies of xu et al 2014 oostrom et al 2016 and onoja et al 2019 according to xu et al 2014 for tight fine and inequigranular sandstone reservoirs the values of m are 0 30 0 45 and 0 60 respectively in the study of oostrom et al 2016 one of the values for m in berea sandstone is 0 464 as proposed by onoja et al 2019 from claystone to coarse sandstone the values of l range from 1 10 to 3 00 because of the tight sandstone used in zhao and yu 2017 the value of m is determined as 0 3 corresponding l 1 4 in addition the density and dynamic viscosity values for two phase fluids both of which vary with the change of pressure are input by interpolation and are based on the data given by the website of https webbook nist gov chemistry fluid moreover sensitive studies on the parameters of interfacial tension ift m and l are performed in the section of 4 results and discussion in the 5 sets of simulations initial water saturations of 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 and 1 respectively pressure imposed on the inlet is defined in the form of an interpolation function p in t moreover the pressure equilibrium time and pressure increment of co2 injection in the simulation is based on the step by step method which is consistent with the method proposed by zhao and yu 2017 and chinese oil and gas industry professional standard sy t 5748 2013 in addition the slip effect has been taken into account in all the simulations the slip effect is also known as the klinkenberg effect the low speed percolation characteristics of gas in porous media of rock are different from that of liquid gas does not produce adsorptive thin layer at the pore wall of rock and the velocity of gas molecule has no obvious difference between the center and the wall of pore this characteristic is called slip effect moreover when the pressure is very low the average free path of the gas molecule reaches the pore size and the gas molecule diffusion can fly freely without collision which leads to the increase of apparent permeability the lower the permeability of rock the more obvious the slip effect the lower the pressure the more obvious the slip effect the modified parameter is set in the model parameter table as 1 0 251 pa kappa0 1 m 2 0 36 p klinkenberg 1941 hu et al 2009 in addition adsorption capacity of the porous media can also lead to slip flow however research on adsorption is usually carried out in organic rich shale or for shale gas production shabro et al 2011 gasparik et al 2014a b moreover the rock core used in zhao and yu 2017 is sandstone with quartz as the main mineral there are no organic matter and clay minerals according to their analysis adsorption does not play a role in co2 breakthrough process so adsorption is not taken into account in this numerical simulation 4 results and discussion 4 1 results on the determination of co2 breakthrough time and breakthrough pressure we selected three points in rock core named a b and c as shown in fig 2 a according to li and yu 2014 and li et al 2015 the primary drainage process during co2 injected into deep saline aquifers can be divided into three stages the first stage is the pushing drainage stage also known as piston drainage stage during which most of the pore water can be drained out by super critical co2 until co2 escapes from the outlet of the rock core in the 5 sets of simulations residual water saturations at the inlet point a decrease obviously at the beginning of displacement as shown by the red lines in fig 2 b f point b is in the center of rock core residual water saturations at this point remain unchanged some may even rise slightly due to the accumulation of water during the drainage process until co2 reaches to this point and then decreases the blue lines in figures point c which is the key point to determine co2 breakthrough time is at the outlet of rock core residual water saturations at this point remain unchanged for a long time until co2 breaks through this rock core shown as green lines in figures moreover the higher the initial water saturation is the longer the residual water saturation at point c remains unchanged that is the longer time for co2 to break through the rock core each curve in the graphs contains continuous data it is worth pointing out that the breakthrough time is not determined according to the obvious inflection point of curve c but according to the slight decrease of residual water saturation at point c which is consistent with the determination of breakthrough point in the practical experiments a small number of gas bubbles emerged at the outlet and the residual water decreased slightly that is to say the residual water saturation at point c decreases slightly which means that co2 breaks through the rock core therefore co2 breakthrough time can be derived from the curves of fig 2 they are 17 21 37 5 65 and 70 h for initial water saturations of 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 and 1 respectively based on the above we can determine the final form of co2 pressurization at the inlet for 5 sets of simulations fig 3 as for co2 breakthrough pressure in the 5 sets of simulations it can be derived from figs 3 and 4 fig 4 is the 3d color map of pressure in rock core over time since the pressure at the outlet the pressure of liquid phase is preset to 8 5 mpa the pressure at the inlet the pressure of gas phase is gradually increasing from 8 5 mpa in the 5 sets of simulations the higher the initial water saturation of the rock core the greater the pressure in rock core at the breakthrough time according to the calculation results of the model co2 breakthrough pressures at 5 breakthrough times are 1 9 2 2 3 3 5 1 and 5 4 mpa for initial water saturations of 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 and 1 in rock core respectively the co2 breakthrough pressure is the difference between the inlet gas phase and the outlet liquid phase pressure which is consistent with the definition of breakthrough pressure mentioned in li et al 2005 and zhao and yu 2017 4 2 discussion based on the calculation results of co2 breakthrough pressure and time we established correlations between the breakthrough pressure time and initial water saturation shown in fig 5 it can be seen from fig 5 a that we found an exponential relationship between the breakthrough pressure and the initial water saturation which is exactly the same as what zhao and yu 2017 described in their practical co2 breakthrough experiments that is 19 p a e b s where p is the breakthrough pressure s is the initial water saturation when the initial water saturation s 0 the breakthrough pressure p is equal to a moreover a is related to the average pore radius b is related to the absolute permeability of the rock core and a zhao and yu 2017 please refer to zhao and yu 2017 for more detailed information on parameters a and b in this study a 1 3621 and b 1 4649 the coefficient of determination r2 is 0 9527 which demonstrates that the relationship is reasonable meanwhile we also found an exponential relationship between the breakthrough time and the initial water saturation which is not revealed in previous experimental studies as shown in fig 5 b which can be described as 20 t c e d s where t is the breakthrough time c 10 989 and d 1 9802 in this study the coefficient of determination r2 is 0 9527 showing that the exponential relationship is reasonable based on this equation when s 0 the breakthrough time t is equal to c however the factors that influencing parameters c and d and their properties are not clarified in the experimental study of zhao and yu 2017 they still need to be determined by a large number of practical experiments in the future in order to verify the accuracy of this simulation results we selected the experimental results of no 4 rock core the parameters of which are the closest to those in this simulation from the study of zhao and yu 2017 to compare with the simulation results as shown in fig 6 from fig 6 it can be seen that the breakthrough pressure of co2 in rock core varies exponentially with the increase of initial water saturation both in experimental and in simulation results in the case of high saturations the simulation results are very close to the experimental ones when the saturation is 1 the two results basically coincide the experiments cannot achieve integer and regular initial water saturation and there are many factors affecting the co2 breakthrough process in practical experiments meanwhile we only consider the effects of initial saturation on breakthrough pressure in this simulation so the simulation data at low saturation are slightly different from the experimental data the overall trend of the experimental data is consistent with that of the simulation and the simulation results are considered to be reasonable and feasible nevertheless we will conduct more complex models which will take into account factors such as interfacial tension contact angle and complex network with micro fractures in the future to further study the comprehensive influence mechanism of various factors on co2 breakthrough pressure for instance liu et al 2017 proposed a model numbered as eq 9 in their study which concludes that variation in ift is related to parameters including but not limited to temperature pressure and salinity based on their model we are trying to conduct a numerical simulation of the effects of the above factors on co2 breakthrough pressure in practical co2 geo sequestration engineering the sealing ability of caprock can also be characterized by the effective permeability after co2 breakthrough the effective permeability is also a key parameter to control co2 migration ability in porous media effective permeability depends on co2 water saturation in pore horseman et al 1999 wollenweber et al 2010 in addition the change of initial water saturation in rocks will affect the gas flow characteristics previous experimental studies on tight sandstone show that the effective permeability of gas decreases significantly with the increase of water saturation thomas et al 1972 byrnes et al 1979 walls et al 1982 rushing et al 2003 however in the field of co2 geo sequestration the research on gas breakthrough pressure and permeability of unsaturated rock is limited zhao and yu 2017 zhao and yu 2018 the curves of effective permeability or relative permeability for two phase fluids can be derived based on the simulation as shown in fig 7 the blue line represents water phase and the green line represents co2 phase for the variation of effective permeability of two phase fluids with initial water saturation in fig 7 a it can be derived that the effective permeability of water increases and the effective permeability of co2 decreases with the increase of initial water saturation in rock core when the initial water saturation in the core is 1 the effective permeability of water can reach the absolute permeability of rock core i e 2 10 6 md when the water saturation in the core is 0 the effective permeability of co2 can also reach the absolute permeability of the core for the relative permeability of two phase fluids fig 7 b f it can be seen that the larger the initial water saturation in rock core the smaller the initial relative permeability of co2 and the larger the initial relative permeability of water however with the operation of the calculation as displacement proceeds the relative permeability of co2 increases gradually until it reaches its maximum while the relative permeability of water decreases gradually until it reaches its minimum finally the relative permeability of each phase can reach the same value in the 5 simulations it demonstrates that the main factor leading to the difference of calculation results is the initial water saturation when the water saturation reaches to the lowest value the displacement characteristics of two phase flow in the 5 simulations are completely consistent this is also considered that with the increase of time most of the water in the core is dried out and the pore space is basically occupied by co2 4 3 sensitive study there are many parameters involved in the breakthrough process of supercritical co2 at rock core scale at present the simulation of the influences of temperature ion concentration and other related factors on the breakthrough process is still in progress and the orthogonal test of multi parameter sensitivity cannot be designed therefore the sensitivity study of breakthrough simulation under different saturations only considers two parameters in this study namely different interfacial tensions ift in co2 h2o system and different values of m l in vg model 4 3 1 effect of interfacial tensions ift on co2 breakthrough pressure table 2 shows that when m 0 3 and l 1 4 the interfacial tensions of 20 25 and 30 mn m are simulated to study the influence of different interfacial tensions on co2 breakthrough when the saturation is low taking saturation of 0 2 as an example the longest breakthrough time is 18 h at 20 mn m and the shortest breakthrough time is 16 5 h at 30 mn m the difference between them is only 1 5 h and the difference of breakthrough pressures is only 0 2 mpa when the saturation increases gradually the influence of interfacial tension is gradually reflected when the saturation is 1 the longest breakthrough time is 87 h at 20 mn m the shortest breakthrough time is 68 5 h at 30 mn m the difference is 18 5 h and the difference of breakthrough pressures is 1 2 mpa therefore under the condition of high saturation the effect of interfacial tension on breakthrough will be more obvious when the interfacial tension is at a low level of 20 mn m with the saturation gradient of 0 2 increasing gradually the breakthrough time increases rapidly the breakthrough time is prolonged by 13 8 h for each increase of average saturation by 0 2 when the interfacial tension increases to 25 mn m the growth rate of breakthrough time decreases when the interfacial tension increases 0 2 the breakthrough time prolongs by 10 6 h on average when the interfacial tension is 30 mn m the growth rate of breakthrough time is close to that of 25 mn m which is 10 4 h it shows that low interfacial tension has an adverse impact on breakthrough the higher the interfacial tension the lower the breakthrough time pressure therefore the interfacial tension is deduced to have a limitation beyond which its impact on breakthrough time and pressure will become smaller 4 3 2 effect of m l values on co2 breakthrough pressure pore distribution index m is a parameter used to characterize the bending degree of saturation characteristic curve also known as shape parameter it decreases with the increase of burial depth and rock density the relationship between parameters l and m is m 1 1 l oostrom et al 2016 so there is only one independent variable m in sensitivity study of m l table 3 shows the values of m 0 3 0 4 and 0 5 when the interfacial tension is 25 mn m in order to study the influence of different values of m l on co2 breakthrough when saturation is low take saturation of 0 2 as an example under three different m values the longest breakthrough time is 27 5 h at m 0 5 and the shortest breakthrough time is 17 h at m 0 3 the difference between them is 10 5 h and the difference of breakthrough pressure is 0 8 mpa when saturation increases gradually the influence of m l gradually manifests when saturation is 1 the longest breakthrough time is 135 h at m 0 5 and the shortest breakthrough time is 70 h at m 0 3 the difference between them is 65 h and the difference of breakthrough pressures is 3 6 mpa therefore under the condition of high saturations the influence of m l on breakthrough will be more obvious under the same saturation condition the larger the m value the lower the gas permeability in the rock core and the greater the breakthrough time pressure 5 conclusion the study of migration accumulation and breakthrough process of co2 in rocks is of great significance for co2 geo sequestration on the one hand rock is the main medium and geological environment for underground fluid flow on the other hand the caprock determines the storage capacity and safety of co2 therefore it is necessary to investigate and reveal the breakthrough pressure of co2 in rocks large numbers of laboratory experiments have been carried out to investigate the mechanisms of co2 breakthrough pressure and many studies have proposed the functional relationship between breakthrough pressure and various influencing factors however these functional relationships are not accurate enough as they are also influenced by other inevitable factors therefore it is urgent to carry out relevant numerical simulation to investigate the impact of a specific factor on co2 breakthrough pressure unfortunately there has been no relevant research so far meanwhile many scholars have also carried out a large number of numerical simulation studies on two phase flow in co2 geo sequestration and many numerical theories have been proposed however there is no numerical simulation study on the breakthrough pressure of co2 in rock cores this is the first attempt to use comsol multiphysics to simulate the co2 breakthrough pressure in a porous medium rock core with different initial water saturations to reveal the effect of initial water saturation which is the single and specific factor on co2 breakthrough pressure in this study a numerical method for studying co2 breakthrough pressure in rock core with various initial water saturations has been proposed based on the step by step method because the rock core is homogeneous and isotropic and water is evenly distributed in the core supercritical co2 displacing water is mainly in a pushing drainage pattern li and yu 2014 li et al 2015 the determination of breakthrough time is based on the slight decrease of water saturation at the outlet of rock core breakthrough pressure is the difference between inlet co2 phase and outlet h2o phase pressures of rock core at the breakthrough time this method is consistent with the method used in the practical co2 breakthrough pressure experiments zhao and yu 2017 in this rock core scale numerical modeling co2 breakthrough times are 17 21 37 5 65 and 70 h similarly co2 breakthrough pressures are 1 9 2 2 3 3 5 1 and 5 4 mpa for initial water saturations of 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 and 1 respectively an exponential function relationship between co2 breakthrough pressure and initial water saturation is established that is p aebs where a 1 362 and b 1 4649 in this study r2 0 9527 indicating that this exponential relationship is reasonable without considering the influence of other factors on co2 breakthrough pressure meanwhile an exponential function relationship between co2 breakthrough time and initial water saturation is also established that is t ceds where c 10 989 and d 1 9802 in this study r2 0 9527 which also proves that the exponential relationship is reasonable however this function has not been explained in experimental studies moreover the experimental data and simulative data of breakthrough pressure are compared and analyzed in this study from the analysis results it is found that the higher the initial water saturation the better the agreement between the experimental data and the simulation ones the overall trend of the experimental data is consistent with that of the simulation which proves that the simulation results are reasonable and feasible sensitivity studies are conducted on key parameters of interfacial tensions 20 25 and 30 mn m in co2 h2o system and m 0 3 0 4 and 0 5 l 1 4 1 7 and 2 values in vg model the results show that 1 under the condition of high saturation the effect of interfacial tension on breakthrough will be more obvious low interfacial tension in co2 h2o system has an adverse impact on co2 breakthrough the higher the interfacial tension the lower the breakthrough pressure and breakthrough time of co2 2 under the condition of high saturations the influence of parameters m and l in vg model on co2 breakthrough will be more obvious at the same saturation the greater the m l parameters the greater the breakthrough pressure and breakthrough time of co2 based on this study the influences of other parameters and their combined effects on co2 breakthrough pressure can also be investigated by comprehensive and more complex numerical models in the future this study can help to select the aquifer with more suitable water saturation for co2

5942,climate change is expected to alter regional hydrological regimes affecting the operation and performance of reservoirs and hydropower facilities this study examines the impacts of climate change on the performance of the three gorges reservoir tgr by means of a detailed daily reservoir regulation and hydropower model linked to a physically based hydrological model and driven by an ensemble of five general circulation models gcms under three representative concentration pathways rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 as precipitation in the basin is expected to increase the projected mean annual inflow and hydropower generation of the tgr will increase by 3 3 5 6 and 0 9 2 3 in 2040 2065 7 9 15 2 and 5 2 8 1 in 2080 2099 respectively these increases are only statistically significant for 2080 2099 and are seasonally concentrated in the spring before the flood season and the early autumn during the end of the flood season however the inter annual variation of power generation will increase specially in the dry season the reservoir performance is highly sensitive to the changes in the seasonal distribution and extremes of streamflow increases in streamflow that occur in the flood season cause significant increases in the amount of spilled water and advance the time when the reservoir reaches the normal storage level additionally increases in both the inter annual variation of inflow and the intensity of inflow shortages during extreme drought years in the impounding stage drive decreases in the fully filled rate and average water storage level in the dry season the utilization rate of water resources under projected extreme streamflow is expected to decrease reshaping the response of power generation to climate change into a non linear pattern where increases in streamflow do not proportionally translate to increases in power generation these findings highlight the complexity of hydropower management and production under future climate change scenarios motivating the need for introducing detailed regulating models for impact assessment studies and adaptive adjustment of the reservoir management to combat climate change keywords climate change three gorges reservoir streamflow hydropower swat data availability climate change projections of the five gcms are publicly available from the inter sectoral impact model intercomparison project isi mip https www

this region however may contact the corresponding author to discuss the exchange of data 1 introduction and background climate change caused by the emission of greenhouse gases ghg is accelerating the global water cycle by increasing evaporation and precipitation rates syed et al 2010 huntington et al 2018 consequently redistributing water resources and exacerbating the severity and occurrence of extreme hydrological events loaiciga et al 1996 syed et al 2010 this will significantly affect the operation of water resource infrastructure such as reservoirs and hydropower production ehsani et al 2017 turner et al 2017a van vliet et al 2016 the increasing demand for energy to support socioeconomic development however will drive continued increases in emissions and the atmospheric concentrations of ghgs resulting in a more dramatic change in the climate and hydrological regime in the 21st century ipcc 2014 on the other hand as a dominant and low cost renewable source of energy hydropower plays a vital role in reducing ghg emissions and mitigating climate change and is experiencing vigorous expansion in many regions of the world berga 2016 numerous studies have investigated climate change impacts on water resources and hydropower generation most of which employed a top down modeling approach using projections from general circulation models gcms integrated with one or more hydrological models and reservoir operation and hydropower models turner et al 2017a van vliet et al 2016 zhou et al 2015 it was generally found that at the global scale the projected annual mean streamflow will increase in high latitude and wet tropical regions decrease in most dry tropical regions and hydrological extremes will become more frequent ipcc 2014 the altered spatial and temporal distribution of streamflow will therefore affect hydropower production with a net global decrease in the 21st century under rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 reported by van vliet et al 2016 and only small parts of the world experiencing an increase in hydropower production including canada northern europe central africa india and northeastern china another recently reported global scale assessment conducted by turner et al 2017a indicated that globally aggregated hydropower production will change by 5 to 5 by the 2080s under a high emissions scenario with the central asia and scandinavia experiencing increases due to climate change a range of national regional and site specific studies have also been conducted elsewhere in the world bartos and chester 2015 de queiroz et al 2016 gaudard et al 2014 kao et al 2015 liu et al 2016 majone et al 2016 maran et al 2014 mendes et al 2017 savelsberg et al 2018 tarroja et al 2016 vicuña et al 2011 despite the large uncertainties sourced from emission scenarios gcms and hydrological models woldemeskel et al 2014 carvajal et al 2017 chilkoti et al 2017 the impacts of climate change on hydrological processes and the water resource system varies widely by region these will depend on local climate change effects topographic features and the local structure of water resource management infrastructure and practices the three gorges reservoir tgr located in the upstream of the yangtze river in china is the world s largest hydroelectric power plant in terms of installed capacity the tgr has a dam height of 185 m and is designed to withstand a normal pool level of 175 m with a storage capacity of 39 3 billion m3 niu 2016 the total installed power capacity of the tgr is 22 500 mw from 34 stand alone turbines and has provided an average yearly production of 92 0 twh since 2012 the capacity factor is only 46 7 leaving much potential untapped due to large annual and inter annual variations in the inflow with a monsoon climate in the upstream catchment the main function of the tgr is flood control therefore it must be operated at a low storage level during the flood season with operation levels increased gradually after the flood season as a result the power production as well as the overall benefits of the tgr are highly dependent on the upstream inflow which is influenced by the climatic conditions long term historical runoff of the tgr basin has been thoroughly investigated and studies have also shown that future runoff patterns are expected to change significantly runoff observations at the yichang hydrological station located 48 km downstream of the tgr can be traced back to 1877 analysis of the yichang station runoff series in the last 120 years shows that the annual minimum runoff and average runoff decreased by 6 and 8 respectively xiong and guo 2004 and the downward trend of average runoff in the last 60 years is more significant zhang et al 2016 over the same time period the annual distribution of runoff showed a homogenization trend zhang et al 2016 studies show that on a 100 year scale the change in runoff is mainly controlled by climate change with human activity only affecting the annual distribution of runoff in this basin liu and du 2017 in recent years however the construction of upstream water conservancy projects and the increase of water demand have increased the influence of human activities on runoff zhang et al 2016 many studies have also assessed future climate change impacts on runoff in the upper catchment of the tgr sun et al 2013 and wang et al 2015 studied the spatiotemporal change of streamflow in the upstream yangtze river in response to climate change under special report on emissions scenarios sres reported by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc in the fourth assessment reports these studies showed that streamflow of the yangtze river will decrease in the 21st century due to decreases in precipitation gu et al 2015 reported that the frequency of extreme floods in the upstream yangtze river is projected to increase significantly at the end of the 21st century under sres scenarios su et al 2017 and chen et al 2017 assessed the impact of climate change on river discharge in the upper reaches of the yangtze river using five gcms from phase 5 of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 under the newest representative concentration pathways rcps adopted by the ipcc in its fifth assessment report these studies concluded that the annual runoff flood season maximum runoff and daily runoff peak would increase due to increases in projected precipitation in the 21st century by contrast birkinshaw et al 2017 used 78 climate model projections from cmip5 and found that in rcp8 5 case precipitation in the upstream of the tgr increased by 4 1 in 2041 2070 but the upper streamflow of the tgr still decreased by 11 1 due to the significant increase of evapotranspiration caused by the rising temperature therefore it can be seen that there is still great uncertainty on the estimated streamflow of the tgr under future climate change relatively few studies have focused on the reservoir performance and hydropower production of the tgr under climate change some existing studies have assessed the impact of climate change on hydropower output in china as a whole as well as specifically in china s yangtze river basin including the tgr from a macro perspective fan et al 2018 liu et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 zhou et al 2015 these results show that china s hydropower output declines in the first half of the 21st century and increases in the second half of the 21st century hydropower output in northern china primarily increases while that in southern china including the tgr primarily decreases and the hydropower variation is consistent with that of annual runoff caused by climate change these studies provide important references for forming china s energy development planning and ghg emission reduction policies however large scale macro studies have to adopt general and simplified schemes for reservoir operation liu et al 2016 van vliet et al 2016 zhou et al 2015 ignoring the specific important features of individual reservoirs which may cause large errors in the estimation of power generation efficiency recent studies have shown that the response of hydropower output to climate change can be non linear if detailed consideration is given to the day to day management of reservoirs turner et al 2017a in addition the effect of extreme hydrological events on power generation may be underestimated as the assessment time scale is usually in months or years naz et al 2018 the tgr is responsible for protecting the lives of tens of millions of people downstream and also provides benefits from power generation navigation water supply and environmental protection therefore tgr scheduling decisions are affected by multiple objectives the response of reservoir performance especially of hydropower generation to changes in climate is far more complicated than other reservoirs jahandideh tehrani et al 2015 rheinheimer and viers 2015 shang et al 2018 this study aims to systematically assess the impact of climate change on the performance of the tgr following a hydrological electricity modeling framework forced by conventional gcms carvajal et al 2017 van vliet et al 2016 specifically with a detailed and realistic reservoir operation simulation at daily scale the novelty and primary contribution of this study is to highlight complexities in the response of the multi purpose tgr reservoir to climate change impacts that have not been previously captured in the literature which has primarily focused on macro scale analyses for this region specifically this study will illuminate the role of multiple reservoir constraints or priorities in shaping how a multi purpose reservoir responds to climate change this provides insight into the potential benefits of tgr management in future climate scenarios as well as how lessons for how these management practices may need to be altered to better adapt to climate change 2 the three gorges reservoir overview and operating rules the tgr controls a catchment area about 1 million km2 ranging from 90 33 e to 111 39 e and 24 21 n to 35 52 n with a large topographic gradient across 200 to 6 500 m fig 1 the average annual precipitation of the basin ranges between 723 and 1134 mm the average annual temperature ranges between 8 6 and 16 8 c and the annual runoff is about 400 billion m3 influenced by the east asian monsoon south asian monsoon and the topography of tibetan plateau the climate and hydrological characteristics have obvious seasonal changes about 80 percent of the annual precipitation and 70 percent of the annual runoff are concentrated in the flood season from may to september causing many heavy rains and floods in contrast the proportion of precipitation and runoff in the dry season is relatively small as a key control and multi purpose hydro development project in the upper yangtze river there are strict operation rules for the tgr niu 2016 shang et al 2018 generally the operation of the tgr can be divided into four stages during a hydrological year flood control impounding normal pool level and falling stage fig 2 from june 10 to september 10 the reservoir level is maintained at a flood limiting level of 145 m when the inflow is less than 35 000 m3 s water is completely released otherwise flood control operations are conducted considering the downstream safety and release capacity of hydro turbines once a flood process recedes the water level must drop to 145 m the impounding stage begins at the end of the flood season with the water level gradually rising to no more than 162 m at the end of september and to 175 m no earlier than the end of october from november to december the reservoir water level should be kept as high as possible if the storage level has already reached the final stage of 175 m otherwise the water level should continue to rise until up to 175 m considering the need for navigation and water supply downstream the minimum release should be no less than 8000 m3 s when the inflow is less than 10 000 m3 s in september and no less than 10 000 m3 s when the inflow is more than 10 000 m3 s in september in october the minimum release should be no less than 8000 m3 s when the inflow is more than 8000 m3 s in november and december the release should be no less than 5300 to 6460 m3 s for special years when the inflow is greater than 35 000 m3 s during the impounding stage the impoundment should suspend and transfer to flood control operation from january to early june is the falling stage with the water level declining steadily to no lower than 155 m at the end of april no higher than 155 m after may 25 and further declining to the base level of 145 m before the flood season in order to satisfy navigation demands ecological protection and water resource utilization downstream the minimum release should be no less than 6000 m3 s during the falling stage the monthly mean inflow water height and power generation during a year are listed in table 1 3 data and methodology 3 1 available data gridded daily climate data with a spatial resolution of 0 5 obtained from the cn05 1 dataset wu and gao 2013 was used for the hydrological model calibration and gcms biases analysis the dataset was constructed from over 2400 observing stations in china from 1961 to 2017 and has been widely used in assessing global and regional climate model performance guo et al 2017 hydrological data were obtained from the changjiang water resources commission cwrc this dataset include 1 monthly observed and naturalized streamflow from 2000 to 2015 at six key hydrological stations in the tgr basin and 2 measured daily inflow outflow and water height at the tgr from 2000 to 2017 the daily hydropower output from 2015 to 2017 and the annual hydropower output from 2012 to 2017 were also collected from china three gorges corporation for the hydropower model calibration climate projections from five gcms gfdl esm2m hadgem2 es ipsl cm5a lr miroc esm chem and noresm1 m under three rcps rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 were obtained from the inter sectoral impact model intercomparison project isi mip the output of these five models was originally derived from the cmip5 and further downscaled and bias corrected using a trend preserving approach with watch forcing data at 0 5 spatial resolution hempel et al 2013 data were divided into a historical baseline period of 1986 2005 and two future periods 2046 2065 and 2080 2099 in order to quantify the impacts of future climate change scenarios summary of the ensemble climate projections are listed in table 2 and detailed magnitude and statistical significance of the changes detected relative to the baseline period for each gcm are presented in figs s1 s2 of the supplementary material for temperature significant uniform increases are projected for both future time horizons and all gcms for precipitation all of the gcms except for hadgem2 es projected weak but not statistically significant increases for 2040 2065 while significant increases in 2080 2099 are expected for all the gcms except for gfdl esm2m 3 2 methodology in this study a physically based and semi distributed hydrological model called the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 was employed to simulate streamflow in the catchment upstream of the tgr under historical and future climate scenarios a simple empirical model was then used to simulate the regulation function of upstream reservoirs so that the natural runoff simulated by swat was revised to the tgr inflow the daily reservoir scheduling of the tgr is then simulated according to the tgr operation rules to obtain the daily discharge and reservoir water level which are used as input to the hydropower model to obtain power generation finally the impact of climate change is comprehensively evaluated by selecting relevant indicators from such aspects as runoff reservoir storage and power generation 3 2 1 streamflow simulation to represent streamflow response to climate change swat was run at a daily time step and a 1 km2 spatial resolution swat was first calibrated with the monthly natural streamflow data during 2000 2009 evaluated with data during 2010 2015 and subsequently run for each climate scenarios under different rcps performance of the calibrated swat model was evaluated using nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and coefficient of determination r2 xu et al 2011 liu et al 2017 mohammed et al 2017 with a value greater than 0 5 is considered acceptable overall the simulation accuracy is reasonably acceptable table 3 with nse ranging from 0 85 to 0 89 during calibration period and 0 81 to 0 91 during validation period r2 ranging from 0 87 to 0 91 during calibration period and 0 88 to 0 92 during validation period no obvious difference was found between calibration and validation period the swat model also closely matches with the well used variable infiltration capacity vic model for the river basin of interest discussed later in section 5 3 3 2 2 reservoir inflow simulation many reservoirs have been built upstream of the tgr and many more are currently under construction or have been proposed for construction by 2016 the accumulated regulated storage capacity of upstream reservoirs has exceeded 52 billion m3 and the planned total storage capacity will reach 100 billion m3 most large reservoirs are capable of seasonal regulation flood control is carried out during the rainy season water is stored at the end of the flood season and the reservoir level is lowered to the flood control level before the start of the next rainy season zhou et al 2017 the upstream reservoirs significantly alter the natural inflow of the tgr flattening the peak inflow during the flood season and causing higher inflow in the dry season zhang et al 2012 considering the large numbers of the upstream reservoirs and complexity of the dispatching process in this study the monthly reservoir inflow model was established based on the regression model using a fitting method feng et al 2017 young 1967 specifically this is accomplished by generalizing the regulating function of upstream reservoirs into one reservoir and subsequently using a moving average algorithm to smooth the daily flood peak process through comparing the flow duration curve fdc of simulated and observed inflow with different moving windows a 15 day duration was determined as the optimal window based on this the natural streamflow simulated by swat was converted into daily tgr inflow regulated by upstream reservoirs considering the systematic bias between the swat simulated streamflow driven by different gcms and cn05 1 the simulated streamflow for each gcm was first corrected by a scaling factor derived from the ratio of the cn05 1 and gcm driven streamflow simulations a comparison of hydrographs for the monthly observed and simulated reservoir inflow during 2000 2016 is shown in fig 3 the simulated inflow matches well with the seasonality of the actual inflow and the peak flows and low flows during many of the validation years are consistent with the observed data except 2004 2015 and 2016 the bias in 2015 is related to the simulation bias of the swat model and the bias of other years may be related to reservoir operation management although there are strict regulations for reservoir operation there is still room for adjustments in real time operation according to the inflow and special demand in general the nse coefficient between simulated and observed inflow is 0 83 with a determination coefficient r2 of 0 85 indicating a considerably high simulation accuracy fig 4 shows the fdc curve of daily observed inflow swat simulated and further revised with upstream reservoir regulation since the regulation of upstream reservoirs was not taken into account the fdc curve of swat simulated inflow is significantly different from that of the observed the low frequency flow simulated by swat is significantly higher than that of the observed while the simulated inflow can reach 135 000 m3 s the actual maximum inflow of the tgr is only 68 000 m3 s however after revised by seasonal adjustment and smoothing processing the simulated inflow is basically close to actual inflow in terms of extreme value distribution which will not cause much error for the analysis of reservoir storage characteristics and power generation prediction 3 2 3 hydropower electricity simulation to simulate hydropower electricity output the reservoir water height and outflow released for hydropower generation in each day is calculated from a mass balance ng et al 2017 carvajal et al 2017 based on the previously simulated inflow 1 s t 1 s t q t r t e t 2 s min s t s max 3 r min r t r max where st is the reservoir storage qt is the reservoir inflow volume rt is the water release volume to the turbines and et is the evaporation loss from the reservoir surface et is neglected on the daily scale since evaporation is very small for the tgr specifically relative to the other factors considered sun et al 2012 st is constrained by the maximum storage smax and the minimum storage smin which dynamically changes during the year depending on the constrained water level of the tgr operating rule curves fig 2 the relationship between reservoir storage and water height was established with the historical observed data using local polynomial regression rt is also constrained between a lower bound rmin and an upper bound rmax considering the downstream safety and water supply requirements in the lower reaches previously described in section 2 finally daily hydropower electricity output in twh is simulated using the following equation carvajal et al 2017 van vliet et al 2016 4 p η ρ g h q t 1 t w h 10 12 w h where q represents the reservoir outflow through turbines m3 s h is the hydraulic head m η is the efficiency of the turbines and generators ranging from 0 to 1 ρ is the water density 103 kg m3 g is the acceleration of gravity which is 9 806 m s2 t is the time step in hours as used in this study 24 h and p is the daily electricity output in twh the overall efficiency η is estimated with a fixed value of 0 920 based on two years of electricity output data the observed daily outflow from the reservoir during 2015 2016 and validation with another year of 2017 fig s3 the hydraulic head h is generally dynamic and can be calculated by the difference of water height between the upstream and downstream of the dam since gezhouba dam is 38 km downstream of the tgr and has a normal operating water level of 66 m the hydraulic head h can be generally estimated by the difference in the storage water height of the tgr using gezhouba dam as the lower bound table s1 lists the hydraulic head corresponding to different reservoir water levels the minimum outflow for one turbine to operate and the maximum effective flow rate for running at maximum capacity calculated using eq 4 simulated and observed power generation are closely matched fig 5 with an average relative error of only 2 1 simulated power generation in 2012 is slightly higher than the observed since the tgr power station was not operated at full capacity until july 2012 and the simulated peak value in the flood season is also slightly higher than the observed fig s3 for the convenience of calculation the hydropower model of this study adopts a uniform annual comprehensive efficiency coefficient in practice the water level difference during tgr operation is large and the efficiency of power generation under different operating water levels hydraulic head will vary so ideally the efficiency coefficient should be dynamic the current assumption therefore leads to the overestimation of power generation under low hydraulic head conditions in flood season nevertheless the overall accuracy of the model is still high and this factor can be ignored compared to the large uncertainties from climate projections and hydrological model 3 2 4 metrics for assessing and quantifying impacts this analysis employs a total of 11 metrics for assessing and quantifying the effects of climate change on the performance of the tgr four focus on changes in upstream streamflow three focus on reservoir fill dynamics and four focus on hydropower generation characteristics the natural streamflow upstream of the tgr is the foundation of reservoir storage and power generation the total runoff directly determines the upper limit of available water resources in addition the flood season storage and extreme high or low flow significantly affect the operation and efficiency of the reservoir therefore four flow metrics are selected to measure the gross amount of streamflow and the change in hydrologic extremes under climate change scenarios for the two future time periods the mean annual flow maf mean flood season flow mff extreme high flow q5 and extreme low flow q95 the extreme high and extreme low flows refer to events when the daily flow exceeded 5 and 95 of the time the tgr is a seasonal regulating reservoir the reliability of full storage in the flood recession period and the storage level have an important influence on the benefits provided by this reservoir in addition the day when the reservoir storage level reaches the maximum impounding level is important for reservoir operation and scheduling therefore three metrics are selected to examine the impact of climate change on the performance of the reservoir impoundment for the two time periods fully filled rate ffr defined as the percentage of years where the maximum fill level reaches the maximum impounding level of 175 m mean first full fill day mfd defined as the average of the first day in each year that the reservoir storage level reaches 175 m and mean fill level mfl which represents the average maximum fill level for the assessment years for hydropower facilities the total power generation is the main metric of interest and its inter annual variation has an important influence on the stability of power supply in addition when the reservoir release is lower than the minimum flow demand of the turbine power generation will cease when the release is higher than the maximum usable flow water will be spilled both of these events will waste water resources from the perspective of power generation and subsequently decrease the utilization efficiency of water resources therefore the mean annual power map coefficient of power variation among years square root of variance mean cv power generation assurance rate par and spilled water rate spw are analyzed par and spw are determined by first calculating the ratio of the number of days in the year below the minimum flow demand for par or above the maximum usable flow for spw to the total number of days for each year then averaging across all years for the evaluation period as the hydraulic head varies with reservoir level and leads to different power generation efficiencies the minimum required and maximum usable flow varies with reservoir levels both thresholds for any reservoir level can be back calculated by eq 4 and values under typical reservoir levels are listed in table s1 4 results 4 1 projected change in streamflow table 4 presents the projected change in the ensemble mean and range of streamflow metrics at the tgr basin the statistical significance of these changes is presented in fig s2 in the supplementary material generally the projected change in the ensemble mean of maf mff q5 and q95 all show increasing trends with the 2080 2099 period being more prominent than that of 2046 2065 while the magnitudes vary across gcms and rcps for maf mff and q5 most of the gcms project an increasing trend under different rcps more than half of which is statistically significant in 2080 2099 especially for rcp8 5 the changes projected by most of the gcms in 2040 2065 are not statistically significant with the exception of hadgem2 es for q95 flow there is only a slight increasing trend for the ensemble mean of all the gcms and both the direction and magnitude of flow change vary significantly across gcms indicating large uncertainty fig 6 displays the monthly average streamflow variation and the coefficient of variation relative to the reference period under different rcps in 2046 2065 and 2080 2099 the projected ensemble mean streamflow increases in most months in the two future time horizons with considerable differences between months in the case of rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 large increases occur in months before the flood season march april may and at the end of the flood season september and there is also a notable increase in the flood season june july august in 2080 2099 the inter annual streamflow variation in each month shows an overall increasing trend except for the relatively small and even slightly reduced changes in january and april a large variance occurs in october december under rcp2 6 in june october under rcp4 5 and in june september under rcp8 5 in addition the coefficient of variation in 2046 2065 is similar to that in 2080 2099 the change in projected future streamflow varies strongly across gcms and there is even no consistency in the direction of change the gfdl esm2m model projects a significant increase of streamflow in the flood season and a decrease in the non flood season resulting in a more concentrated streamflow distribution pattern the inter annual streamflow variation simulated by gfdl esm2m model is always much greater than other gcms representing a more extreme climate change scenario the ipsl cm5a lr model by contrast shows a small increase or decrease of streamflow in the flood season and an increase in the non flood season this model also shows a more moderate and inconsistent direction of change in inter annual variation representing a more moderate climate change scenario the behavior of the other three gcms is between the previously described models the hadgem2 es model is specifically characterized by a larger increase in streamflow in accordance with precipitation fig s1 unfortunately future projections for the study region show a more extreme and fluctuating climate ipcc 2013 deng et al 2013 chen and frauenfeld 2014 zhou et al 2014 4 2 projected change in reservoir impoundment table 5 shows the projected changes in the ensemble mean and range of reservoir storage metrics relative to the reference period under different rcps it is observed that the ffr decreases by 0 7 6 7 under all rcps in 2046 2065 with the largest decline under rcp4 5 and increases by 3 3 7 3 under all rcps in 2080 2099 with the largest increase under rcp8 5 the mfd is consistently advanced under all rcps in both future time horizons respectively by 2 0 4 7 days and 2 6 8 4 days averaged over gcms the mfl shows a decreasing trend with an average decrease by 0 2 0 6 m in 2046 2065 and by 0 1 0 2 m in 2080 2099 however the results show a wide spread across gcms for all the three metrics without agreement on the direction of change detailed performance of each gcm can be seen in fig s4 the gfdl esm2m model always deviates distinctly from the other four gcms showing a significant decrease in ffr and mfl due to a more intense and large inter annual variation in streamflow most gcms project a slight change for ffr and mfl over 2046 2065 but a significant increase over 2080 2099 nevertheless the advanced trend for mfd exhibits much better agreement compared with the projected streamflow the disagreements of these projected reservoir storage metrics are larger the impoundment period of the tgr is from september to november and the change of reservoir storage metrics are closely related to the change of streamflow in this period the future mfd is projected to occur earlier consistent with the significant increasing trend of streamflow in september the ffr declines slightly in the period of 2046 2065 this is likely due to the small increases or even decreases of streamflow in october and november and also the increase of the inter annual streamflow variation in september and november the decrease of the ffr is the main reason for the decline of the mfl while in some cases with an increase of ffr mfl increases weakly or even declines indicating that the reservoir levels in the non fully filled years are abnormally low fig 7 presents the average storage level in non fully filled years in the reference period and the future two time slices it can be seen that the average maximum storage level as well as the average dry season reservoir level of non fully filled years are lower in the future compared to the reference period indicating that extreme low inflows during the storage period will be more severe 4 3 projected change in hydropower production table 6 shows the projected change in the ensemble mean and range of the hydropower metrics relative to the reference period under different rcps the map generally increases in the two future time horizons and its inter annual variation increases in most situations the par decreases slightly while the spw remarkably increases nevertheless it is worth noting that the results show a large spread across the gcms and rcps with no agreement in the direction of change for all metrics except for spw in 2080 2099 statistical significance of the changes for each metric fig s2 demonstrates that the increase of map is only consistently significant for all gcms in 2080 2099 under rcp8 5 and the increase of spw is significant for most gcms in both time horizons while the change of par is not significant in most situations detailed information on the seasonal variability and performance of each gcm is presented in fig 8 power generation increases mainly in march may and september and is also notable for october in 2080 2099 change of the inter annual variation of power generation is small and concentrated in the rainy season may september but the spilled water significantly increases for all gcms indicating an inadequate utilization capacity of the infrastructure while the inter annual variation of power generation in the dry season depends on the gcms and although the power generation assurance rate increases in january april for most gcms these exhibit large spreads in september december among the gcms the gfdl esm2m model shows a distinct increase for inter annual variation of power generation a decrease for power assurance rate in the dry season and an increase for spilled water in the rainy season resulting in a total decrease of power generation this model represents an extreme case for the impacts of climate change with regard to intensity and fluctuations on the contrary the ipsl cm5a lr model shows a weak increase or decrease of inter annual variation of power generation a slight increase of power assurance rate and a moderate increase of spilled water driving an increase of power generation especially in 2080 2099 seen in fig s2 in addition the hadgem2 es model displays a significant increase in hydropower generation for both time horizons due to a large increase in the projected streamflow fig s2 5 discussion climate change can alter the amount and temporal distribution of natural inflow for reservoirs and thus affect their operational efficiency meanwhile the regulation and operation of reservoirs will also affect the impact of climate change on water resources thus making its impact more complicated ehsani et al 2017 giuliani et al 2016 therefore for basins of highly developed and managed assessing the impacts of climate change depends largely on the local hydraulic infrastructures and their management taking tgr as a case study this study comprehensively evaluates the impact of the climate change on the streamflow and reservoir performance through coupling gcms output with hydrological models as well as detailed reservoir operation scheme and specifically gives concrete insight into how climate change affects hydrological regimes and hydropower output under reservoir operation the projected future changes of hydropower for the tgr in this study are generally consistent with findings from turner et al 2017b who projected a 3 5 5 2 increase of hydropower for china mainly in the south by the end of 21st with a detailed reservoir operation model however the opposite trend is found when compared with a previous study by liu et al 2016 which projected a loss in hydropower as a result of the projected decrease in streamflow it is obvious that dissimilar results may be obtained by different data sources and models used and highlights the need to reveal the mechanism of hydropower response to climate change which will be discussed below 5 1 response of streamflow to climate change this study shows that the basin mean temperature is projected to increase by 1 5 5 4 c and precipitation is projected to increase by 4 1 11 7 in the tgr basin by the mid and late 21st century the simulated annual average streamflow and the extreme high and low flows are all expected to increase generally most previous studies have shown that change of streamflow is consistent with that of precipitation in the study region zhang et al 2018 chen et al 2017 su et al 2017 sun et al 2013 in this study the response of streamflow to precipitation is roughly linear for each 10 increase of precipitation streamflow increases by 15 fig 9 this is consistent with the results by birkinshaw et al 2017 which showed that for every 10 increase in precipitation simulated streamflow increased by 18 7 however there is a relatively weak response of streamflow evapotranspiration to temperature increase in our study only results in a 2 2 decrease of streamflow this is comparable with the observed small decreasing trend of actual evapotranspiration under historical climate change in the past 60 years wang et al 2007 while this was as high as 19 in the study by birkinshaw et al 2017 a similar phenomenon of decreased streamflow caused by strong increases of evapotranspiration is also observed from liu et al 2016 despite the changes in the quantity this study shows an increase in the inter annual variation of streamflow in accordance with that of precipitation which is also revealed by zhang et al 2018 for the yangtze river 5 2 response of hydropower generation to streamflow change 5 2 1 influence of seasonal differences in this study the annual and monthly average streamflows in the tgr basin are projected to increase in the middle and late 21st century leading to an overall increase in power generation the operation schedule of the tgr however differs distinctly from flood season to dry season therefore the influence of streamflow change in each season on the reservoir performance is different autumn is the critical period for the tgr s impounding the significant increase of projected streamflow in september improves the ffr and brings forward the average mfd which is conducive to improving the capacity of the tgr to replenish the downstream flows and generate power during the dry season on the contrary under the condition of insufficient inflow causing the reservoir to not be fully filled in autumn the operational efficiency of the reservoir in the following whole dry season will be affected fig 10 therefore the condition of impoundment in autumn can profoundly influence the total reservoir benefit over a year in the spring the reservoir is usually at a high operating level and allows the hydropower facility to operate at high efficiency as a result increases in spring streamflow will dramatically increase power generation due to the low operating level in the flood season the low generating efficiency of turbines and the limitation of installed capacity the increase of power generation caused by increased streamflow is limited in the winter dry season since the normal streamflow is relatively low the impact on the power generation is relatively small this study for the first time evaluates the impact of hydrological changes on tgr operation by season which helps to understand the potential benefits of the tgr scheduling management in future climate change scenarios and the necessity of adapting to climate change 5 2 2 influence of extreme flow this study projects that the extreme high flow in the tgr basin increases significantly in the middle and late 21st century indicating more severe flooding in the future for a flood peak within a limited magnitude and time interval the tgr can effectively impound the flood to avoid downstream damage in the case when the streamflow from upstream is too concentrated however preparations should be made for the next peak regulation event this will require the tgr to release a large amount of water that may exceed the maximum flow rate of the turbines resulting in abandoned spilled water consequently the utilization rate of water resources is reduced in addition the operating water level of tgr at the present stage can rise 1 5 m above the flood limit of 145 m when there is no flood during flood season which can significantly improve the efficiency of power generation zhou et al 2018 however with the increase of extreme high flows in the future flood control services provided by the tgr will become more important requiring greater flood storage capacity as a result the operating water level of tgr will be further lowered leading to a decrease in power generation efficiency on the other hand although the projected annual extreme low flow has a slight increasing trend the inter annual variation of streamflow also increases especially in the impounding stage consequently although the fully filled rate is slightly increased and the average initial time to reach the normal storage level occurs earlier the storage level in the years where the reservoir is not fully filled is abnormally low this leads to the decline of the multi year mean water level and a decrease in assurance rate and reliability of power generation the projected change in inter annual variability of power generation suggests that new operational schemes at the tgr and in upstream reservoirs may be required to sustain required generation 5 2 3 influence of the time scale of hydropower model for the sake of flood control the tgr scheduling cannot ensure the maximum utilization efficiency of water resources and the extreme low flow in a dry year may cause power generation to cease during certain days therefore the response of power generation to streamflow is expected to be non linear fig 11 a shows the response of annual power generation to annual streamflow based on the accumulation of daily power generation obtained by eq 4 and reservoir inflow it can be seen that when the annual streamflow is 25 higher or 30 lower than the average in the reference period the power generation is lower than the 1 1 line indicating that our study using a detailed reservoir model run at the daily scale well captured the nonlinear response mechanism however if the daily inflow is synthesized into monthly for calculation of hydropower the response relationship is generally linear with a slight deviation only when the streamflow is over 70 higher than average fig 11b this occurs since a monthly scale model does not reflect the decrease in water utilization efficiency with extreme flow based on the monthly scale model the average power generation in 2046 2065 will be overestimated by 2 4 and that in 2080 2099 will be overestimated by 4 3 which may be considered as the maximum increase potential after fully adapting to climate change many large scale studies assume a linear relationship between hydropower production and streamflow for example kao et al 2015 and bartos and chester 2015 assessed the effects of climate change on hydropower in the united states by regressing power generation on streamflow which is appropriate at the macro scale but may overestimate the efficiency of water utilization for a particular reservoir hydropower station as flood control is the first priority of many large hydraulic infrastructures in china this study provides valuable reference for further exploration of other facilities as well as regional and national hydropower assessment 5 3 uncertainties of the study this study employs three typical rcps and five gcms from cmip5 which have been proven to capture a large fraction of the full range of cmip5 projections mcsweeney and jones 2016 this provides a wide range of hydrological projections in this study area allowing for drawing more robust conclusions about uncertainty for the impact assessment of hydropower however considerable bias exists in the statistical downscaling procedure with watch as well as the mismatch of gridded data in calibrating the hydrological model with cn05 1 since watch does not cover the calibration period as shown in fig s5 compared with cn05 1 watch underestimates the precipitation by 11 1 and the downscaling of the five gcms based on watch further lowered the precipitation by 1 1 8 8 lowered the simulated streamflow by 3 0 21 1 however the systematic errors were considered during the two step regulation process of upstream reservoirs by introducing a scaling factor in the seasonal adjustment model as a result the difference in fdc curve of the reservoir inflow for different climate forcing data is significantly reduced fig s5 which would have little effect on the simulation of reservoir regulation and power generation nevertheless under the future scenario the simulated maximum inflow can reach 100 000 noresm1 m 165 000 gfdl esm2m m3 s fig s6 which is about twice the maximum flow in the reference period 1986 2005 while in the past 1 000 years the largest flood in the tgr basin occurred in 1870 with a peak flow of about 105 000 m3 s liu et al 2011 therefore there may be large uncertainty in the simulated extreme high flow the simulation bias of extreme streamflow has little effect on the study of total water resources but it is very important to the evaluation of reservoir regulation and power generation whilst this study uses only one hydrological model swat it has been proven that swat performs as well as other hydrological models in the study area su et al 2017 the average error of annual streamflow simulation results was less than 5 among the four hydrological models chen et al 2017 which is smaller than that of the gcms however the projected extreme low flow in this study shows a weak increasing trend while it has been pointed out by other studies that there is a relatively higher uncertainty from hydrological models for lowflow simulation than that for high flow giuntoli et al 2015 chen et al 2017 there is also substantial uncertainty in reservoir regulation there are hundreds of reservoirs in the upstream of the tgr therefore the river streamflow in the basin has been artificially altered to a large degree zhang et al 2012 due to the complexity in joint operation of cascade reservoirs and difficulties in data collection this study did not consider the impact of reservoir operation on river streamflow in the swat simulation but adopted a static empirical correction method however as the streamflow volume varies in different years the reservoir operation changes correspondingly therefore this empirical relationship may not be stable across years which introduces substantial uncertainty for the simulation of the inflow of the tgr in the future the operation and management of the tgr and the upstream reservoirs may change to cope with new requirements and changing environmental conditions due to climate change which are not considered in this study in addition the flood storage capacity of reservoirs in the upstream will increase to double that of current levels according to the long term construction plan zhou et al 2017 by the time of their completion the constraint for flood control for the tgr will decrease during the flood season this may reduce spilled water and result in more usable flood resources and power production assuming that the abandoned water can be fully utilized after the coordinated joint operation of upstream reservoirs the estimated results of the monthly scale model in section 5 2 indicates that the power generation in the middle of the 21st century will increase by about 4 4 4 7 compared to current levels and further increase by 9 5 12 4 at the end of the 21st century this is likely to be the best result that can be obtained after considering adaptation to climate change 6 conclusions the tgr is a well known large scale water conservancy project in china and the world that provides comprehensive benefits of flood control power generation and navigation which will be affected by climate change in this study a hydrological model was driven by the climate change projections of five gcms under three rcps to simulate the change of natural streamflow in the tgr basin under climate change the simulated streamflow was revised for upstream reservoir regulation by an empirical method subsequently based on the dynamic simulation of reservoir operation and hydropower facilities the comprehensive impact of climate change on the inflow water storage and power generation of tgr in the middle and late 21st century was systematically assessed the role and vulnerability of the large scale water conservancy project in changing the impact of climate change on water resources were revealed it is projected that compared to the reference period of 1986 2005 the average annual streamflow flood season flow q5 high flow and q95 low flow in the tgr basin will increase in the periods of 2046 2065 and 2080 2099 however the inter annual variation of streamflow will increase and there are wide spreads across gcms and rcps implying large uncertainties inherent in the projections as a result the performance of the reservoir changes but with inconsistent trends the average time to reach the normal storage level in the impounding stage is likely to be advanced however the fully filled rate exhibits an increase in 2080 2099 but a decline in 2046 2065 and the mean storage level in the dry season decline for both time horizons assuming that future reservoir regulation remains unchanged from the present situation it is estimated that the annual average power generation will increase by 2 0 2 3 in 2046 2065 and by 5 2 8 1 in 2080 2099 occurring mainly in the spring before the flood season and the early autumn during the end of the flood season however the change is only statistically significant in the latter time horizon and the inter annual variation of power generation increases especially in the dry season at the same time the power generation assurance rate in the dry season exhibits a weak increase or decrease but spilled water significantly increases in the flood season if adaptation measures are taken to prevent the occurrence of spilling the maximum gain of power generation due to climate change in 2046 2065 is 4 4 4 7 and that is 9 5 12 4 in 2080 2099 overall this study highlighted the role of large storage reservoir operations in reshaping impact of climate change on water resources utilization firstly the comprehensive benefits of the reservoir are most sensitive to the inflow during the impounding period secondly the increase of streamflow in the dry season significantly improves power generation finally the increase of streamflow in the flood season does not necessarily yield increased power generation depending on the capacity and utilization efficiency of reservoirs this is particularly prominent in the monsoon climate region due to the high temporal concentration and large inter annual variability of precipitation and streamflow meanwhile the reservoir management also increases the uncertainty in assessing the impact of future climate change giuliani et al 2016 turner et al 2017a in addition this study has highlighted the increasing trend of extreme hydrological processes and their effect on reservoir performance extreme hydrological events on the one hand lead to an increase of flood control pressure and difficulty of reservoir management on the other hand these events reduce the utilization efficiency of water resources leading to the non linear response of hydropower output to climate change the assessment of this effect requires climate and hydrological information with a high temporal resolution as well as meticulously capturing reservoir operation however the projection of extreme hydrological processes is currently a significant challenge facing the scientific community although an increasing number of studies show that the intensity and frequency of extreme precipitation and streamflow on a global scale will increase in the future great uncertainty still exists in the exact nature and magnitude and the uncertainty in projection of extreme streamflow is markedly greater than that in the projection of average streamflow sillmann et al 2013 mohammed et al 2017 these findings indicate that the water resources management of the tgr and upstream basin must take corresponding adaptive measures in the future in order to make use of flood water and cope with the risk of increased inter annual fluctuation of inflow during the impounding period increasing the flood storage capacity and strengthening the joint operation of the upstream cascade reservoirs are important means to overcome these adverse effects and are expected to turn adverse effects into favorable ones the next step is to strengthen the research on the integrated management strategy of water resources in the upstream of tgr under climate change declaration of competing

5942,climate change is expected to alter regional hydrological regimes affecting the operation and performance of reservoirs and hydropower facilities this study examines the impacts of climate change on the performance of the three gorges reservoir tgr by means of a detailed daily reservoir regulation and hydropower model linked to a physically based hydrological model and driven by an ensemble of five general circulation models gcms under three representative concentration pathways rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 as precipitation in the basin is expected to increase the projected mean annual inflow and hydropower generation of the tgr will increase by 3 3 5 6 and 0 9 2 3 in 2040 2065 7 9 15 2 and 5 2 8 1 in 2080 2099 respectively these increases are only statistically significant for 2080 2099 and are seasonally concentrated in the spring before the flood season and the early autumn during the end of the flood season however the inter annual variation of power generation will increase specially in the dry season the reservoir performance is highly sensitive to the changes in the seasonal distribution and extremes of streamflow increases in streamflow that occur in the flood season cause significant increases in the amount of spilled water and advance the time when the reservoir reaches the normal storage level additionally increases in both the inter annual variation of inflow and the intensity of inflow shortages during extreme drought years in the impounding stage drive decreases in the fully filled rate and average water storage level in the dry season the utilization rate of water resources under projected extreme streamflow is expected to decrease reshaping the response of power generation to climate change into a non linear pattern where increases in streamflow do not proportionally translate to increases in power generation these findings highlight the complexity of hydropower management and production under future climate change scenarios motivating the

global water cycle by increasing evaporation and precipitation rates syed et al 2010 huntington et al 2018 consequently redistributing water resources and exacerbating the severity and occurrence of extreme hydrological events loaiciga et al 1996 syed et al 2010 this will significantly affect the operation of water resource infrastructure such as reservoirs and hydropower production ehsani et al 2017 turner et al 2017a van vliet et al 2016 the increasing demand for energy to support socioeconomic development however will drive continued increases in emissions and the atmospheric concentrations of ghgs resulting in a more dramatic change in the climate and hydrological regime in the 21st century ipcc 2014 on the other hand as a dominant and low cost renewable source of energy hydropower plays a vital role in reducing ghg emissions and mitigating climate change and is experiencing vigorous expansion in many regions of the world berga 2016 numerous studies have investigated climate change impacts on water resources and hydropower generation most of which employed a top down modeling approach using projections from general circulation models gcms integrated with one or more hydrological models and reservoir operation and hydropower models turner et al 2017a van vliet et al 2016 zhou et al 2015 it was generally found that at the global scale the projected annual mean streamflow will increase in high latitude and wet tropical regions decrease in most dry tropical regions and hydrological extremes will become more frequent ipcc 2014 the altered spatial and temporal distribution of streamflow will therefore affect hydropower production with a net global decrease in the 21st century under rcp2 6 and rcp8 5 reported by van vliet et al 2016 and only small parts of the world experiencing an increase in hydropower production including canada northern europe central africa india and northeastern china another recently reported global scale assessment conducted by turner et al 2017a indicated that globally aggregated hydropower production will change by 5 to 5 by the 2080s under a high emissions scenario with the central asia and scandinavia experiencing increases due to climate change a range of national regional and site specific studies have also been conducted elsewhere in the world bartos and chester 2015 de queiroz et al 2016 gaudard et al 2014 kao et al 2015 liu et al 2016 majone et al 2016 maran et al 2014 mendes et al 2017 savelsberg et al 2018 tarroja et al 2016 vicuña et al 2011 despite the large uncertainties sourced from emission scenarios gcms and hydrological models woldemeskel et al 2014 carvajal et al 2017 chilkoti et al 2017 the impacts of climate change on hydrological processes and the water resource system varies widely by region these will depend on local climate change effects topographic features and the local structure of water resource management infrastructure and practices the three gorges reservoir tgr located in the upstream of the yangtze river in china is the world s largest hydroelectric power plant in terms of installed capacity the tgr has a dam height of 185 m and is designed to withstand a normal pool level of 175 m with a storage capacity of 39 3 billion m3 niu 2016 the total installed power capacity of the tgr is 22 500 mw from 34 stand alone turbines and has provided an average yearly production of 92 0 twh since 2012 the capacity factor is only 46 7 leaving much potential untapped due to large annual and inter annual variations in the inflow with a monsoon climate in the upstream catchment the main function of the tgr is flood control therefore it must be operated at a low storage level during the flood season with operation levels increased gradually after the flood season as a result the power production as well as the overall benefits of the tgr are highly dependent on the upstream inflow which is influenced by the climatic conditions long term historical runoff of the tgr basin has been thoroughly investigated and studies have also shown that future runoff patterns are expected to change significantly runoff observations at the yichang hydrological station located 48 km downstream of the tgr can be traced back to 1877 analysis of the yichang station runoff series in the last 120 years shows that the annual minimum runoff and average runoff decreased by 6 and 8 respectively xiong and guo 2004 and the downward trend of average runoff in the last 60 years is more significant zhang et al 2016 over the same time period the annual distribution of runoff showed a homogenization trend zhang et al 2016 studies show that on a 100 year scale the change in runoff is mainly controlled by climate change with human activity only affecting the annual distribution of runoff in this basin liu and du 2017 in recent years however the construction of upstream water conservancy projects and the increase of water demand have increased the influence of human activities on runoff zhang et al 2016 many studies have also assessed future climate change impacts on runoff in the upper catchment of the tgr sun et al 2013 and wang et al 2015 studied the spatiotemporal change of streamflow in the upstream yangtze river in response to climate change under special report on emissions scenarios sres reported by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc in the fourth assessment reports these studies showed that streamflow of the yangtze river will decrease in the 21st century due to decreases in precipitation gu et al 2015 reported that the frequency of extreme floods in the upstream yangtze river is projected to increase significantly at the end of the 21st century under sres scenarios su et al 2017 and chen et al 2017 assessed the impact of climate change on river discharge in the upper reaches of the yangtze river using five gcms from phase 5 of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 under the newest representative concentration pathways rcps adopted by the ipcc in its fifth assessment report these studies concluded that the annual runoff flood season maximum runoff and daily runoff peak would increase due to increases in projected precipitation in the 21st century by contrast birkinshaw et al 2017 used 78 climate model projections from cmip5 and found that in rcp8 5 case precipitation in the upstream of the tgr increased by 4 1 in 2041 2070 but the upper streamflow of the tgr still decreased by 11 1 due to the significant increase of evapotranspiration caused by the rising temperature therefore it can be seen that there is still great uncertainty on the estimated streamflow of the tgr under future climate change relatively few studies have focused on the reservoir performance and hydropower production of the tgr under climate change some existing studies have assessed the impact of climate change on hydropower output in china as a whole as well as specifically in china s yangtze river basin including the tgr from a macro perspective fan et al 2018 liu et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 zhou et al 2015 these results show that china s hydropower output declines in the first half of the 21st century and increases in the second half of the 21st century hydropower output in northern china primarily increases while that in southern china including the tgr primarily decreases and the hydropower variation is consistent with that of annual runoff caused by climate change these studies provide important references for forming china s energy development planning and ghg emission reduction policies however large scale macro studies have to adopt general and simplified schemes for reservoir operation liu et al 2016 van vliet et al 2016 zhou et al 2015 ignoring the specific important features of individual reservoirs which may cause large errors in the estimation of power generation efficiency recent studies have shown that the response of hydropower output to climate change can be non linear if detailed consideration is given to the day to day management of reservoirs turner et al 2017a in addition the effect of extreme hydrological events on power generation may be underestimated as the assessment time scale is usually in months or years naz et al 2018 the tgr is responsible for protecting the lives of tens of millions of people downstream and also provides benefits from power generation navigation water supply and environmental protection therefore tgr scheduling decisions are affected by multiple objectives the response of reservoir performance especially of hydropower generation to changes in climate is far more complicated than other reservoirs jahandideh tehrani et al 2015 rheinheimer and viers 2015 shang et al 2018 this study aims to systematically assess the impact of climate change on the performance of the tgr following a hydrological electricity modeling framework forced by conventional gcms carvajal et al 2017 van vliet et al 2016 specifically with a detailed and realistic reservoir operation simulation at daily scale the novelty and primary contribution of this study is to highlight complexities in the response of the multi purpose tgr reservoir to climate change impacts that have not been previously captured in the literature which has primarily focused on macro scale analyses for this region specifically this study will illuminate the role of multiple reservoir constraints or priorities in shaping how a multi purpose reservoir responds to climate change this provides insight into the potential benefits of tgr management in future climate scenarios as well as how lessons for how these management practices may need to be altered to better adapt to climate change 2 the three gorges reservoir overview and operating rules the tgr controls a catchment area about 1 million km2 ranging from 90 33 e to 111 39 e and 24 21 n to 35 52 n with a large topographic gradient across 200 to 6 500 m fig 1 the average annual precipitation of the basin ranges between 723 and 1134 mm the average annual temperature ranges between 8 6 and 16 8 c and the annual runoff is about 400 billion m3 influenced by the east asian monsoon south asian monsoon and the topography of tibetan plateau the climate and hydrological characteristics have obvious seasonal changes about 80 percent of the annual precipitation and 70 percent of the annual runoff are concentrated in the flood season from may to september causing many heavy rains and floods in contrast the proportion of precipitation and runoff in the dry season is relatively small as a key control and multi purpose hydro development project in the upper yangtze river there are strict operation rules for the tgr niu 2016 shang et al 2018 generally the operation of the tgr can be divided into four stages during a hydrological year flood control impounding normal pool level and falling stage fig 2 from june 10 to september 10 the reservoir level is maintained at a flood limiting level of 145 m when the inflow is less than 35 000 m3 s water is completely released otherwise flood control operations are conducted considering the downstream safety and release capacity of hydro turbines once a flood process recedes the water level must drop to 145 m the impounding stage begins at the end of the flood season with the water level gradually rising to no more than 162 m at the end of september and to 175 m no earlier than the end of october from november to december the reservoir water level should be kept as high as possible if the storage level has already reached the final stage of 175 m otherwise the water level should continue to rise until up to 175 m considering the need for navigation and water supply downstream the minimum release should be no less than 8000 m3 s when the inflow is less than 10 000 m3 s in september and no less than 10 000 m3 s when the inflow is more than 10 000 m3 s in september in october the minimum release should be no less than 8000 m3 s when the inflow is more than 8000 m3 s in november and december the release should be no less than 5300 to 6460 m3 s for special years when the inflow is greater than 35 000 m3 s during the impounding stage the impoundment should suspend and transfer to flood control operation from january to early june is the falling stage with the water level declining steadily to no lower than 155 m at the end of april no higher than 155 m after may 25 and further declining to the base level of 145 m before the flood season in order to satisfy navigation demands ecological protection and water resource utilization downstream the minimum release should be no less than 6000 m3 s during the falling stage the monthly mean inflow water height and power generation during a year are listed in table 1 3 data and methodology 3 1 available data gridded daily climate data with a spatial resolution of 0 5 obtained from the cn05 1 dataset wu and gao 2013 was used for the hydrological model calibration and gcms biases analysis the dataset was constructed from over 2400 observing stations in china from 1961 to 2017 and has been widely used in assessing global and regional climate model performance guo et al 2017 hydrological data were obtained from the changjiang water resources commission cwrc this dataset include 1 monthly observed and naturalized streamflow from 2000 to 2015 at six key hydrological stations in the tgr basin and 2 measured daily inflow outflow and water height at the tgr from 2000 to 2017 the daily hydropower output from 2015 to 2017 and the annual hydropower output from 2012 to 2017 were also collected from china three gorges corporation for the hydropower model calibration climate projections from five gcms gfdl esm2m hadgem2 es ipsl cm5a lr miroc esm chem and noresm1 m under three rcps rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 were obtained from the inter sectoral impact model intercomparison project isi mip the output of these five models was originally derived from the cmip5 and further downscaled and bias corrected using a trend preserving approach with watch forcing data at 0 5 spatial resolution hempel et al 2013 data were divided into a historical baseline period of 1986 2005 and two future periods 2046 2065 and 2080 2099 in order to quantify the impacts of future climate change scenarios summary of the ensemble climate projections are listed in table 2 and detailed magnitude and statistical significance of the changes detected relative to the baseline period for each gcm are presented in figs s1 s2 of the supplementary material for temperature significant uniform increases are projected for both future time horizons and all gcms for precipitation all of the gcms except for hadgem2 es projected weak but not statistically significant increases for 2040 2065 while significant increases in 2080 2099 are expected for all the gcms except for gfdl esm2m 3 2 methodology in this study a physically based and semi distributed hydrological model called the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 was employed to simulate streamflow in the catchment upstream of the tgr under historical and future climate scenarios a simple empirical model was then used to simulate the regulation function of upstream reservoirs so that the natural runoff simulated by swat was revised to the tgr inflow the daily reservoir scheduling of the tgr is then simulated according to the tgr operation rules to obtain the daily discharge and reservoir water level which are used as input to the hydropower model to obtain power generation finally the impact of climate change is comprehensively evaluated by selecting relevant indicators from such aspects as runoff reservoir storage and power generation 3 2 1 streamflow simulation to represent streamflow response to climate change swat was run at a daily time step and a 1 km2 spatial resolution swat was first calibrated with the monthly natural streamflow data during 2000 2009 evaluated with data during 2010 2015 and subsequently run for each climate scenarios under different rcps performance of the calibrated swat model was evaluated using nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and coefficient of determination r2 xu et al 2011 liu et al 2017 mohammed et al 2017 with a value greater than 0 5 is considered acceptable overall the simulation accuracy is reasonably acceptable table 3 with nse ranging from 0 85 to 0 89 during calibration period and 0 81 to 0 91 during validation period r2 ranging from 0 87 to 0 91 during calibration period and 0 88 to 0 92 during validation period no obvious difference was found between calibration and validation period the swat model also closely matches with the well used variable infiltration capacity vic model for the river basin of interest discussed later in section 5 3 3 2 2 reservoir inflow simulation many reservoirs have been built upstream of the tgr and many more are currently under construction or have been proposed for construction by 2016 the accumulated regulated storage capacity of upstream reservoirs has exceeded 52 billion m3 and the planned total storage capacity will reach 100 billion m3 most large reservoirs are capable of seasonal regulation flood control is carried out during the rainy season water is stored at the end of the flood season and the reservoir level is lowered to the flood control level before the start of the next rainy season zhou et al 2017 the upstream reservoirs significantly alter the natural inflow of the tgr flattening the peak inflow during the flood season and causing higher inflow in the dry season zhang et al 2012 considering the large numbers of the upstream reservoirs and complexity of the dispatching process in this study the monthly reservoir inflow model was established based on the regression model using a fitting method feng et al 2017 young 1967 specifically this is accomplished by generalizing the regulating function of upstream reservoirs into one reservoir and subsequently using a moving average algorithm to smooth the daily flood peak process through comparing the flow duration curve fdc of simulated and observed inflow with different moving windows a 15 day duration was determined as the optimal window based on this the natural streamflow simulated by swat was converted into daily tgr inflow regulated by upstream reservoirs considering the systematic bias between the swat simulated streamflow driven by different gcms and cn05 1 the simulated streamflow for each gcm was first corrected by a scaling factor derived from the ratio of the cn05 1 and gcm driven streamflow simulations a comparison of hydrographs for the monthly observed and simulated reservoir inflow during 2000 2016 is shown in fig 3 the simulated inflow matches well with the seasonality of the actual inflow and the peak flows and low flows during many of the validation years are consistent with the observed data except 2004 2015 and 2016 the bias in 2015 is related to the simulation bias of the swat model and the bias of other years may be related to reservoir operation management although there are strict regulations for reservoir operation there is still room for adjustments in real time operation according to the inflow and special demand in general the nse coefficient between simulated and observed inflow is 0 83 with a determination coefficient r2 of 0 85 indicating a considerably high simulation accuracy fig 4 shows the fdc curve of daily observed inflow swat simulated and further revised with upstream reservoir regulation since the regulation of upstream reservoirs was not taken into account the fdc curve of swat simulated inflow is significantly different from that of the observed the low frequency flow simulated by swat is significantly higher than that of the observed while the simulated inflow can reach 135 000 m3 s the actual maximum inflow of the tgr is only 68 000 m3 s however after revised by seasonal adjustment and smoothing processing the simulated inflow is basically close to actual inflow in terms of extreme value distribution which will not cause much error for the analysis of reservoir storage characteristics and power generation prediction 3 2 3 hydropower electricity simulation to simulate hydropower electricity output the reservoir water height and outflow released for hydropower generation in each day is calculated from a mass balance ng et al 2017 carvajal et al 2017 based on the previously simulated inflow 1 s t 1 s t q t r t e t 2 s min s t s max 3 r min r t r max where st is the reservoir storage qt is the reservoir inflow volume rt is the water release volume to the turbines and et is the evaporation loss from the reservoir surface et is neglected on the daily scale since evaporation is very small for the tgr specifically relative to the other factors considered sun et al 2012 st is constrained by the maximum storage smax and the minimum storage smin which dynamically changes during the year depending on the constrained water level of the tgr operating rule curves fig 2 the relationship between reservoir storage and water height was established with the historical observed data using local polynomial regression rt is also constrained between a lower bound rmin and an upper bound rmax considering the downstream safety and water supply requirements in the lower reaches previously described in section 2 finally daily hydropower electricity output in twh is simulated using the following equation carvajal et al 2017 van vliet et al 2016 4 p η ρ g h q t 1 t w h 10 12 w h where q represents the reservoir outflow through turbines m3 s h is the hydraulic head m η is the efficiency of the turbines and generators ranging from 0 to 1 ρ is the water density 103 kg m3 g is the acceleration of gravity which is 9 806 m s2 t is the time step in hours as used in this study 24 h and p is the daily electricity output in twh the overall efficiency η is estimated with a fixed value of 0 920 based on two years of electricity output data the observed daily outflow from the reservoir during 2015 2016 and validation with another year of 2017 fig s3 the hydraulic head h is generally dynamic and can be calculated by the difference of water height between the upstream and downstream of the dam since gezhouba dam is 38 km downstream of the tgr and has a normal operating water level of 66 m the hydraulic head h can be generally estimated by the difference in the storage water height of the tgr using gezhouba dam as the lower bound table s1 lists the hydraulic head corresponding to different reservoir water levels the minimum outflow for one turbine to operate and the maximum effective flow rate for running at maximum capacity calculated using eq 4 simulated and observed power generation are closely matched fig 5 with an average relative error of only 2 1 simulated power generation in 2012 is slightly higher than the observed since the tgr power station was not operated at full capacity until july 2012 and the simulated peak value in the flood season is also slightly higher than the observed fig s3 for the convenience of calculation the hydropower model of this study adopts a uniform annual comprehensive efficiency coefficient in practice the water level difference during tgr operation is large and the efficiency of power generation under different operating water levels hydraulic head will vary so ideally the efficiency coefficient should be dynamic the current assumption therefore leads to the overestimation of power generation under low hydraulic head conditions in flood season nevertheless the overall accuracy of the model is still high and this factor can be ignored compared to the large uncertainties from climate projections and hydrological model 3 2 4 metrics for assessing and quantifying impacts this analysis employs a total of 11 metrics for assessing and quantifying the effects of climate change on the performance of the tgr four focus on changes in upstream streamflow three focus on reservoir fill dynamics and four focus on hydropower generation characteristics the natural streamflow upstream of the tgr is the foundation of reservoir storage and power generation the total runoff directly determines the upper limit of available water resources in addition the flood season storage and extreme high or low flow significantly affect the operation and efficiency of the reservoir therefore four flow metrics are selected to measure the gross amount of streamflow and the change in hydrologic extremes under climate change scenarios for the two future time periods the mean annual flow maf mean flood season flow mff extreme high flow q5 and extreme low flow q95 the extreme high and extreme low flows refer to events when the daily flow exceeded 5 and 95 of the time the tgr is a seasonal regulating reservoir the reliability of full storage in the flood recession period and the storage level have an important influence on the benefits provided by this reservoir in addition the day when the reservoir storage level reaches the maximum impounding level is important for reservoir operation and scheduling therefore three metrics are selected to examine the impact of climate change on the performance of the reservoir impoundment for the two time periods fully filled rate ffr defined as the percentage of years where the maximum fill level reaches the maximum impounding level of 175 m mean first full fill day mfd defined as the average of the first day in each year that the reservoir storage level reaches 175 m and mean fill level mfl which represents the average maximum fill level for the assessment years for hydropower facilities the total power generation is the main metric of interest and its inter annual variation has an important influence on the stability of power supply in addition when the reservoir release is lower than the minimum flow demand of the turbine power generation will cease when the release is higher than the maximum usable flow water will be spilled both of these events will waste water resources from the perspective of power generation and subsequently decrease the utilization efficiency of water resources therefore the mean annual power map coefficient of power variation among years square root of variance mean cv power generation assurance rate par and spilled water rate spw are analyzed par and spw are determined by first calculating the ratio of the number of days in the year below the minimum flow demand for par or above the maximum usable flow for spw to the total number of days for each year then averaging across all years for the evaluation period as the hydraulic head varies with reservoir level and leads to different power generation efficiencies the minimum required and maximum usable flow varies with reservoir levels both thresholds for any reservoir level can be back calculated by eq 4 and values under typical reservoir levels are listed in table s1 4 results 4 1 projected change in streamflow table 4 presents the projected change in the ensemble mean and range of streamflow metrics at the tgr basin the statistical significance of these changes is presented in fig s2 in the supplementary material generally the projected change in the ensemble mean of maf mff q5 and q95 all show increasing trends with the 2080 2099 period being more prominent than that of 2046 2065 while the magnitudes vary across gcms and rcps for maf mff and q5 most of the gcms project an increasing trend under different rcps more than half of which is statistically significant in 2080 2099 especially for rcp8 5 the changes projected by most of the gcms in 2040 2065 are not statistically significant with the exception of hadgem2 es for q95 flow there is only a slight increasing trend for the ensemble mean of all the gcms and both the direction and magnitude of flow change vary significantly across gcms indicating large uncertainty fig 6 displays the monthly average streamflow variation and the coefficient of variation relative to the reference period under different rcps in 2046 2065 and 2080 2099 the projected ensemble mean streamflow increases in most months in the two future time horizons with considerable differences between months in the case of rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 large increases occur in months before the flood season march april may and at the end of the flood season september and there is also a notable increase in the flood season june july august in 2080 2099 the inter annual streamflow variation in each month shows an overall increasing trend except for the relatively small and even slightly reduced changes in january and april a large variance occurs in october december under rcp2 6 in june october under rcp4 5 and in june september under rcp8 5 in addition the coefficient of variation in 2046 2065 is similar to that in 2080 2099 the change in projected future streamflow varies strongly across gcms and there is even no consistency in the direction of change the gfdl esm2m model projects a significant increase of streamflow in the flood season and a decrease in the non flood season resulting in a more concentrated streamflow distribution pattern the inter annual streamflow variation simulated by gfdl esm2m model is always much greater than other gcms representing a more extreme climate change scenario the ipsl cm5a lr model by contrast shows a small increase or decrease of streamflow in the flood season and an increase in the non flood season this model also shows a more moderate and inconsistent direction of change in inter annual variation representing a more moderate climate change scenario the behavior of the other three gcms is between the previously described models the hadgem2 es model is specifically characterized by a larger increase in streamflow in accordance with precipitation fig s1 unfortunately future projections for the study region show a more extreme and fluctuating climate ipcc 2013 deng et al 2013 chen and frauenfeld 2014 zhou et al 2014 4 2 projected change in reservoir impoundment table 5 shows the projected changes in the ensemble mean and range of reservoir storage metrics relative to the reference period under different rcps it is observed that the ffr decreases by 0 7 6 7 under all rcps in 2046 2065 with the largest decline under rcp4 5 and increases by 3 3 7 3 under all rcps in 2080 2099 with the largest increase under rcp8 5 the mfd is consistently advanced under all rcps in both future time horizons respectively by 2 0 4 7 days and 2 6 8 4 days averaged over gcms the mfl shows a decreasing trend with an average decrease by 0 2 0 6 m in 2046 2065 and by 0 1 0 2 m in 2080 2099 however the results show a wide spread across gcms for all the three metrics without agreement on the direction of change detailed performance of each gcm can be seen in fig s4 the gfdl esm2m model always deviates distinctly from the other four gcms showing a significant decrease in ffr and mfl due to a more intense and large inter annual variation in streamflow most gcms project a slight change for ffr and mfl over 2046 2065 but a significant increase over 2080 2099 nevertheless the advanced trend for mfd exhibits much better agreement compared with the projected streamflow the disagreements of these projected reservoir storage metrics are larger the impoundment period of the tgr is from september to november and the change of reservoir storage metrics are closely related to the change of streamflow in this period the future mfd is projected to occur earlier consistent with the significant increasing trend of streamflow in september the ffr declines slightly in the period of 2046 2065 this is likely due to the small increases or even decreases of streamflow in october and november and also the increase of the inter annual streamflow variation in september and november the decrease of the ffr is the main reason for the decline of the mfl while in some cases with an increase of ffr mfl increases weakly or even declines indicating that the reservoir levels in the non fully filled years are abnormally low fig 7 presents the average storage level in non fully filled years in the reference period and the future two time slices it can be seen that the average maximum storage level as well as the average dry season reservoir level of non fully filled years are lower in the future compared to the reference period indicating that extreme low inflows during the storage period will be more severe 4 3 projected change in hydropower production table 6 shows the projected change in the ensemble mean and range of the hydropower metrics relative to the reference period under different rcps the map generally increases in the two future time horizons and its inter annual variation increases in most situations the par decreases slightly while the spw remarkably increases nevertheless it is worth noting that the results show a large spread across the gcms and rcps with no agreement in the direction of change for all metrics except for spw in 2080 2099 statistical significance of the changes for each metric fig s2 demonstrates that the increase of map is only consistently significant for all gcms in 2080 2099 under rcp8 5 and the increase of spw is significant for most gcms in both time horizons while the change of par is not significant in most situations detailed information on the seasonal variability and performance of each gcm is presented in fig 8 power generation increases mainly in march may and september and is also notable for october in 2080 2099 change of the inter annual variation of power generation is small and concentrated in the rainy season may september but the spilled water significantly increases for all gcms indicating an inadequate utilization capacity of the infrastructure while the inter annual variation of power generation in the dry season depends on the gcms and although the power generation assurance rate increases in january april for most gcms these exhibit large spreads in september december among the gcms the gfdl esm2m model shows a distinct increase for inter annual variation of power generation a decrease for power assurance rate in the dry season and an increase for spilled water in the rainy season resulting in a total decrease of power generation this model represents an extreme case for the impacts of climate change with regard to intensity and fluctuations on the contrary the ipsl cm5a lr model shows a weak increase or decrease of inter annual variation of power generation a slight increase of power assurance rate and a moderate increase of spilled water driving an increase of power generation especially in 2080 2099 seen in fig s2 in addition the hadgem2 es model displays a significant increase in hydropower generation for both time horizons due to a large increase in the projected streamflow fig s2 5 discussion climate change can alter the amount and temporal distribution of natural inflow for reservoirs and thus affect their operational efficiency meanwhile the regulation and operation of reservoirs will also affect the impact of climate change on water resources thus making its impact more complicated ehsani et al 2017 giuliani et al 2016 therefore for basins of highly developed and managed assessing the impacts of climate change depends largely on the local hydraulic infrastructures and their management taking tgr as a case study this study comprehensively evaluates the impact of the climate change on the streamflow and reservoir performance through coupling gcms output with hydrological models as well as detailed reservoir operation scheme and specifically gives concrete insight into how climate change affects hydrological regimes and hydropower output under reservoir operation the projected future changes of hydropower for the tgr in this study are generally consistent with findings from turner et al 2017b who projected a 3 5 5 2 increase of hydropower for china mainly in the south by the end of 21st with a detailed reservoir operation model however the opposite trend is found when compared with a previous study by liu et al 2016 which projected a loss in hydropower as a result of the projected decrease in streamflow it is obvious that dissimilar results may be obtained by different data sources and models used and highlights the need to reveal the mechanism of hydropower response to climate change which will be discussed below 5 1 response of streamflow to climate change this study shows that the basin mean temperature is projected to increase by 1 5 5 4 c and precipitation is projected to increase by 4 1 11 7 in the tgr basin by the mid and late 21st century the simulated annual average streamflow and the extreme high and low flows are all expected to increase generally most previous studies have shown that change of streamflow is consistent with that of precipitation in the study region zhang et al 2018 chen et al 2017 su et al 2017 sun et al 2013 in this study the response of streamflow to precipitation is roughly linear for each 10 increase of precipitation streamflow increases by 15 fig 9 this is consistent with the results by birkinshaw et al 2017 which showed that for every 10 increase in precipitation simulated streamflow increased by 18 7 however there is a relatively weak response of streamflow evapotranspiration to temperature increase in our study only results in a 2 2 decrease of streamflow this is comparable with the observed small decreasing trend of actual evapotranspiration under historical climate change in the past 60 years wang et al 2007 while this was as high as 19 in the study by birkinshaw et al 2017 a similar phenomenon of decreased streamflow caused by strong increases of evapotranspiration is also observed from liu et al 2016 despite the changes in the quantity this study shows an increase in the inter annual variation of streamflow in accordance with that of precipitation which is also revealed by zhang et al 2018 for the yangtze river 5 2 response of hydropower generation to streamflow change 5 2 1 influence of seasonal differences in this study the annual and monthly average streamflows in the tgr basin are projected to increase in the middle and late 21st century leading to an overall increase in power generation the operation schedule of the tgr however differs distinctly from flood season to dry season therefore the influence of streamflow change in each season on the reservoir performance is different autumn is the critical period for the tgr s impounding the significant increase of projected streamflow in september improves the ffr and brings forward the average mfd which is conducive to improving the capacity of the tgr to replenish the downstream flows and generate power during the dry season on the contrary under the condition of insufficient inflow causing the reservoir to not be fully filled in autumn the operational efficiency of the reservoir in the following whole dry season will be affected fig 10 therefore the condition of impoundment in autumn can profoundly influence the total reservoir benefit over a year in the spring the reservoir is usually at a high operating level and allows the hydropower facility to operate at high efficiency as a result increases in spring streamflow will dramatically increase power generation due to the low operating level in the flood season the low generating efficiency of turbines and the limitation of installed capacity the increase of power generation caused by increased streamflow is limited in the winter dry season since the normal streamflow is relatively low the impact on the power generation is relatively small this study for the first time evaluates the impact of hydrological changes on tgr operation by season which helps to understand the potential benefits of the tgr scheduling management in future climate change scenarios and the necessity of adapting to climate change 5 2 2 influence of extreme flow this study projects that the extreme high flow in the tgr basin increases significantly in the middle and late 21st century indicating more severe flooding in the future for a flood peak within a limited magnitude and time interval the tgr can effectively impound the flood to avoid downstream damage in the case when the streamflow from upstream is too concentrated however preparations should be made for the next peak regulation event this will require the tgr to release a large amount of water that may exceed the maximum flow rate of the turbines resulting in abandoned spilled water consequently the utilization rate of water resources is reduced in addition the operating water level of tgr at the present stage can rise 1 5 m above the flood limit of 145 m when there is no flood during flood season which can significantly improve the efficiency of power generation zhou et al 2018 however with the increase of extreme high flows in the future flood control services provided by the tgr will become more important requiring greater flood storage capacity as a result the operating water level of tgr will be further lowered leading to a decrease in power generation efficiency on the other hand although the projected annual extreme low flow has a slight increasing trend the inter annual variation of streamflow also increases especially in the impounding stage consequently although the fully filled rate is slightly increased and the average initial time to reach the normal storage level occurs earlier the storage level in the years where the reservoir is not fully filled is abnormally low this leads to the decline of the multi year mean water level and a decrease in assurance rate and reliability of power generation the projected change in inter annual variability of power generation suggests that new operational schemes at the tgr and in upstream reservoirs may be required to sustain required generation 5 2 3 influence of the time scale of hydropower model for the sake of flood control the tgr scheduling cannot ensure the maximum utilization efficiency of water resources and the extreme low flow in a dry year may cause power generation to cease during certain days therefore the response of power generation to streamflow is expected to be non linear fig 11 a shows the response of annual power generation to annual streamflow based on the accumulation of daily power generation obtained by eq 4 and reservoir inflow it can be seen that when the annual streamflow is 25 higher or 30 lower than the average in the reference period the power generation is lower than the 1 1 line indicating that our study using a detailed reservoir model run at the daily scale well captured the nonlinear response mechanism however if the daily inflow is synthesized into monthly for calculation of hydropower the response relationship is generally linear with a slight deviation only when the streamflow is over 70 higher than average fig 11b this occurs since a monthly scale model does not reflect the decrease in water utilization efficiency with extreme flow based on the monthly scale model the average power generation in 2046 2065 will be overestimated by 2 4 and that in 2080 2099 will be overestimated by 4 3 which may be considered as the maximum increase potential after fully adapting to climate change many large scale studies assume a linear relationship between hydropower production and streamflow for example kao et al 2015 and bartos and chester 2015 assessed the effects of climate change on hydropower in the united states by regressing power generation on streamflow which is appropriate at the macro scale but may overestimate the efficiency of water utilization for a particular reservoir hydropower station as flood control is the first priority of many large hydraulic infrastructures in china this study provides valuable reference for further exploration of other facilities as well as regional and national hydropower assessment 5 3 uncertainties of the study this study employs three typical rcps and five gcms from cmip5 which have been proven to capture a large fraction of the full range of cmip5 projections mcsweeney and jones 2016 this provides a wide range of hydrological projections in this study area allowing for drawing more robust conclusions about uncertainty for the impact assessment of hydropower however considerable bias exists in the statistical downscaling procedure with watch as well as the mismatch of gridded data in calibrating the hydrological model with cn05 1 since watch does not cover the calibration period as shown in fig s5 compared with cn05 1 watch underestimates the precipitation by 11 1 and the downscaling of the five gcms based on watch further lowered the precipitation by 1 1 8 8 lowered the simulated streamflow by 3 0 21 1 however the systematic errors were considered during the two step regulation process of upstream reservoirs by introducing a scaling factor in the seasonal adjustment model as a result the difference in fdc curve of the reservoir inflow for different climate forcing data is significantly reduced fig s5 which would have little effect on the simulation of reservoir regulation and power generation nevertheless under the future scenario the simulated maximum inflow can reach 100 000 noresm1 m 165 000 gfdl esm2m m3 s fig s6 which is about twice the maximum flow in the reference period 1986 2005 while in the past 1 000 years the largest flood in the tgr basin occurred in 1870 with a peak flow of about 105 000 m3 s liu et al 2011 therefore there may be large uncertainty in the simulated extreme high flow the simulation bias of extreme streamflow has little effect on the study of total water resources but it is very important to the evaluation of reservoir regulation and power generation whilst this study uses only one hydrological model swat it has been proven that swat performs as well as other hydrological models in the study area su et al 2017 the average error of annual streamflow simulation results was less than 5 among the four hydrological models chen et al 2017 which is smaller than that of the gcms however the projected extreme low flow in this study shows a weak increasing trend while it has been pointed out by other studies that there is a relatively higher uncertainty from hydrological models for lowflow simulation than that for high flow giuntoli et al 2015 chen et al 2017 there is also substantial uncertainty in reservoir regulation there are hundreds of reservoirs in the upstream of the tgr therefore the river streamflow in the basin has been artificially altered to a large degree zhang et al 2012 due to the complexity in joint operation of cascade reservoirs and difficulties in data collection this study did not consider the impact of reservoir operation on river streamflow in the swat simulation but adopted a static empirical correction method however as the streamflow volume varies in different years the reservoir operation changes correspondingly therefore this empirical relationship may not be stable across years which introduces substantial uncertainty for the simulation of the inflow of the tgr in the future the operation and management of the tgr and the upstream reservoirs may change to cope with new requirements and changing environmental conditions due to climate change which are not considered in this study in addition the flood storage capacity of reservoirs in the upstream will increase to double that of current levels according to the long term construction plan zhou et al 2017 by the time of their completion the constraint for flood control for the tgr will decrease during the flood season this may reduce spilled water and result in more usable flood resources and power production assuming that the abandoned water can be fully utilized after the coordinated joint operation of upstream reservoirs the estimated results of the monthly scale model in section 5 2 indicates that the power generation in the middle of the 21st century will increase by about 4 4 4 7 compared to current levels and further increase by 9 5 12 4 at the end of the 21st century this is likely to be the best result that can be obtained after considering adaptation to climate change 6 conclusions the tgr is a well known large scale water conservancy project in china and the world that provides comprehensive benefits of flood control power generation and navigation which will be affected by climate change in this study a hydrological model was driven by the climate change projections of five gcms under three rcps to simulate the change of natural streamflow in the tgr basin under climate change the simulated streamflow was revised for upstream reservoir regulation by an empirical method subsequently based on the dynamic simulation of reservoir operation and hydropower facilities the comprehensive impact of climate change on the inflow water storage and power generation of tgr in the middle and late 21st century was systematically assessed the role and vulnerability of the large scale water conservancy project in changing the impact of climate change on water resources were revealed it is projected that compared to the reference period of 1986 2005 the average annual streamflow flood season flow q5 high flow and q95 low flow in the tgr basin will increase in the periods of 2046 2065 and 2080 2099 however the inter annual variation of streamflow will increase and there are wide spreads across gcms and rcps implying large uncertainties inherent in the projections as a result the performance of the reservoir changes but with inconsistent trends the average time to reach the normal storage level in the impounding stage is likely to be advanced however the fully filled rate exhibits an increase in 2080 2099 but a decline in 2046 2065 and the mean storage level in the dry season decline for both time horizons assuming that future reservoir regulation remains unchanged from the present situation it is estimated that the annual average power generation will increase by 2 0 2 3 in 2046 2065 and by 5 2 8 1 in 2080 2099 occurring mainly in the spring before the flood season and the early autumn during the end of the flood season however the change is only statistically significant in the latter time horizon and the inter annual variation of power generation increases especially in the dry season at the same time the power generation assurance rate in the dry season exhibits a weak increase or decrease but spilled water significantly increases in the flood season if adaptation measures are taken to prevent the occurrence of spilling the maximum gain of power generation due to climate change in 2046 2065 is 4 4 4 7 and that is 9 5 12 4 in 2080 2099 overall this study highlighted the role of large storage reservoir operations in reshaping impact of climate change on water resources utilization firstly the comprehensive benefits of the reservoir are most sensitive to the inflow during the impounding period secondly the increase of streamflow in the dry season significantly improves power generation finally the increase of streamflow in the flood season does not necessarily yield increased power generation depending on the capacity and utilization efficiency of reservoirs this is particularly prominent in the monsoon climate region due to the high temporal concentration and large inter annual variability of precipitation and streamflow meanwhile the reservoir management also increases the uncertainty in assessing the impact of future climate change giuliani et al 2016 turner et al 2017a in addition this study has highlighted the increasing trend of extreme hydrological processes and their effect on reservoir performance extreme hydrological events on the one hand lead to an increase of flood control pressure and difficulty of reservoir management on the other hand these events reduce the utilization efficiency of water resources leading to the non linear response of hydropower output to climate change the assessment of this effect requires climate and hydrological information with a high temporal resolution as well as meticulously capturing reservoir operation however the projection of extreme hydrological processes is currently a significant challenge facing the scientific community although an increasing number of studies show that the intensity and frequency of extreme precipitation and streamflow on a global scale will increase in the future great uncertainty still exists in the exact nature and magnitude and the uncertainty in projection of extreme streamflow is markedly greater than that in the projection of average streamflow sillmann et al 2013 mohammed et al 2017 these findings indicate that the water resources management of the tgr and upstream basin must take corresponding adaptive measures in the future in order to make use of flood water and cope with the risk of increased inter annual fluctuation of inflow during the impounding period increasing the flood storage capacity and strengthening the joint operation of the upstream cascade reservoirs are important means to overcome these adverse effects and are expected to turn adverse effects into favorable ones the next step is to strengthen the research on the integrated management strategy of water resources in the upstream of tgr under climate change declaration of competing

5943,river network coding is important for hydrological model on the aspects of water cycles simulation water resources evaluation and extreme hydrological events forecast however the existing river network coding methods had several disadvantages such as the river network coding structure is too complex to understand the river network topology is difficult to identify the river network coding capacity is limited to overcome the above mentioned shortcomings this paper proposed a new topological and hierarchical river coding method based on the river network created by the dem digital elevation method data and arcgis software this method systematically defines the river levels based on the hydrology structure from outlet to source the river directly flows into the watershed outlet is river l1 the branch of river l1 with a certain catchment area is river l2 the branch of l2 with a certain catchment area is river l3 and so on secondly we proposed a flexible coding scheme that encode the river segments with pure digital numbers hierarchically taking the two digits scheme for example the l1 river segments are coded with a sequence number such as 01 02 03 the l2 river segments inherit the river code from the l1 stem river segment add a serial of self order numbers 01 02 03 from the junction to the river source and become 0101 0102 0103 the process of coding the river segments at subsequent level is similar finally this new coding method was programmed in matlab software and successfully examined in the amazon river basin the world s largest watershed as a case study the results show that the new method is competent for easily controlling the river level and river segment density flexibly adjusting the code digital numbers to fit different basins with abundant or little rivers easily plotting the topological relationship automatically encoding by computer program and easily understood in a word this study is a useful attempt to create new river network coding method and it also has positive significance to promote the hydrological simulation research keywords river network hydrology structure hierarchy river coding multi flexible scheme tree like pfafstetter 1 introduction the river network division and coding is the foundation for distributed hydrological model a powerful tool for distributed hydrological simulation flood risk forecast and watershed management beighley et al 2015 qiu et al 2019 yoon and beighley 2015 supporting a variety of ecological and environmental activities beven 1993 radinger et al 2016 stein 2018 with the augmented demand of hydrological simulations under the changed environment building a fast and convenient watershed coding method is critical and a hot topic in hydrology research qiu et al 2019 luo et al 2006 nowadays a lot of coding methods has been established around the world liu et al 2014 these methods could mainly be divided into two categories tree like and hierarchy structure river coding methods for the tree like coding method it usually codes all of the river segments in a basin recursively based on the topological structure of river network the horton strahler scheme is probably the earliest tree like coding method in the word established by horton in 1932 and further developed by strahler horton 1932 moussa 2009 this method encodes the river level from the river source to the outlet and orders the first river segment at the river source as level 1 when multiple river segments converge to form a river segment it is assigned with a higher level number song et al 2019 although this method is still widely used today and integrated into arcgis software radinger et al 2016 it could not encode the position of river segments and sensitive to dem resolution and scales chavan and srinivas 2015 moussa 2009 other tree like river coding methods that could indicate both the level and code of river segment were subsequently proposed demir and szczepanek 2017 these methods code the river network from the river outlet to source and employ several elements to indicate the level and position of river segment for example the binary tree based and dyadic indicated coding method proposed by li et al 2006 applied two elements bslength bsvalue which presented the logical distance to the outlet of the watershed and the sequence number in its corresponding level of the binary tree respectively wang et al 2007 li et al 2006 it was further improved and extended to three elements in 2009 regionindex bslength bsvalue by adding an region elements to avoid causing computational overflow when the number of river segments is larger than 264 wang et al 2009 in 2014 the stem branch topological codification sbtc developed by liu et al liu et al 2014 included four element coding system o s b u which were outlet id code stem chain code branch chain code and upstream number code respectively liu et al 2014 it can be seen these tree like river coding methods have many advantages such as clearly expressing the river level characterizing the river s topological structure and hydraulic connection and displaying the rivers at different levels on one layer however their river code are complex usually consists of two or more code elements and could not clearly reflect the hierarchical relationship of rivers at different levels the hierarchical structure coding method compared to the tree like river coding method refers to a type of river coding method that divide the river network into several hierarchical levels and store them in different layers separately the most successful hierarchical structure river network coding method is the pfafstetter coding method established by a brazilian engineer otter pfafstetter in 1989 which characterized the hierarchical relationship of river network with a brief river code verdin and verdin 1999 this method usually divides the watershed into nine sub watersheds iteratively from large to small the four largest tributaries are assigned with even numbers i e 2 4 6 and 8 from the downstream to upstream and the corresponding five sub basins along the mainstem are assigned odd numbers i e 1 3 5 7 and 9 li et al 2010 the river in the higher level inherited the numerical code from its lower hierarchical level labeling with digits 1 to 9 at level 1 11 to 99 at level 2 111 to 999 at level 3 and so on verdin and verdin 1999 with the advantage of coding efficiently with pure digital number and nesting hierarchy which can be easily understood this method is the most widely used river coding method in the world currently such as the national water information system of usgs 1987 the french system used in africa south america europe and oceania 1968 the codification scheme defined by brazil hydroelectric power agency 1987 the hydro1k database 2001 the australian hydrological geospatial fabric 2014 the hydrologic derivatives for modeling and analysis 2017 and the main river code in china and so on jia et al 2006 usgs unitied states geological survey 2001 verdin 2017 in addition a large number of scholars have further improved the applicability of pfafstetter method such as dividing the watershed into more flexible parts to suit for different watershed with less or more than 4 tributaries and adding english alphabet for more meanings formetta et al 2011 stein 2018 however the pfafstetter method still has some shortcomings for hydrological analysis liu et al 2014 stein 2018 for example it neither distinguishes the stem tributary relationships strictly nor determines the level of river segment uniquely the efficiency decreases in identifying the topology when less than 9 division is applied li et al 2010 meanwhile it is difficult to splice split add and delete river segments liu et al 2014 therefore a robust coding method which could better reflect the topological relationship of drainage network facilitate the automatic calculation and easy to understood is need to meet these needs and absorb the advantages of two kinds of methods above we established a new river coding method which was based on the tree structure and code each river segment hierarchically with only one single digital coding element then this new method was implemented and tested in the amazon basin with the largest river basin and a mass of tributaries in the world for instance 2 methodology the new river network coding method established in this study mainly includes two parts identify river segment level and then code themselves the river segment code structure and variation are described in the following sections 2 1 identify the level of different rivers this method assumed that the river network conformed to the tree structure the main streams and tributaries of different level were identified hierarchically in fig 1 1 the river directly flows into the watershed outlet is river l1 level 1 as shown in the black line in fig 1a the stem of river l1 is identified based on the catchment area in tracing back process more specifically when judging two segments flowing together from outlet to source the river segment with a larger catchment area is regard as the stem and the smaller one as branch 2 river l2 level 2 is the branch of river l1 and has a contribution catchment area larger than a certain threshold the blue line in fig 1a while that smaller than this threshold was neglected and then the l2 stem is identified based on the catchment area of river segment from the confluence to source similarly to determination of the l1 stem above 3 river l3 is the branch of l2 that have a catchment area larger than the threshold of river l3 level 3 the yellow line in fig 1a successively the rivers of subordinate level were identified similarly such as the rivers l4 level 4 the green line in fig 1a and so on it should be noted that the threshold for each level river is very important and impact the structure of the river network de bartolo et al 2016 de bartolo et al 2009 which could change according to the research purpose and also could be replaced by other indicators such as flow and river length stein 2018 2 2 coding the river segment in this study based on the river level above we proposed a flexible river segment coding scheme and took two digits scheme for example fig 1b 1 the river l1 are partitioned into several l1 river segments by the junctions with its tributaries i e the l2 river and these l1 river segments are coded with a sequence number from the outlet to the source of the rive l1 such as 01 02 03 e g the black river segment codes in fig 1b 2 the l2 river segments are divided and obtained by its tributaries i e the l3 river as same as that of l1 the code of l2 river segment e g 0101 0102 includes two part the inherited father code and self ordering code the father code of l2 river segment code i e the first two digits inherited from the l1 stem river segment code e g 01 which it flows into and the self ordering code second two digits was created by a serial number 01 02 03 from the junction to the river source e g the blue river segment codes in fig 1b 3 in this scheme the river segment codes of higher level are firstly inherited the father code of lower level and then added a sequence number 01 02 03 similarly the river segment code for other levels are created subsequently e g the orange and green codes in fig 1b 2 3 the river segment code structure the new river segment code system established in this study is composed by pure digital number the structure of river segment code is legible in fig 2 taking the two digits scheme for example the first two digit x1x2 is the code of l1 the second two digit x3x4 is the code of l2 the third two digit x5x6 is the code of l3 and so on in other words the number of river segment code digits is as double as its level for example the segment 01020501 with eight digits represents the river segment is in level 4 while the river segment 0102 with four digits indicates the river segment is at level 2 in fact the river segment coding scheme that reserve two digits for each level is only suitable for the basin with total river segments less than 99 in its longest river the other coding system schemes for the basin with more or fewer river segments are discussed as follows 2 4 coding system variation the number of digits of each river segment code could been changed according to the maximum segment number of the longest river mn in different basin for mn less than 9 the digital number for each level could been shrunk into one to simplify the river code fig 3 a while for mn more than 100 and less than 1000 the digital number for each level could been extended into three digits to cover all of the river segments in a basin fig 3c fig 3 and table 1 show the description and comparison of these three river segment coding schemes i e one two and three digital number for each level for the special case of more than two branches converging into a same river segment one special number was applied to make them uniquely such as the number ① in fig 3 if a river segment has more than two tributaries the first two river segements with the largest catchment areas are regarded as the main stream and first tributary and coded normally using the river coding method established above however the other tributaries are coded differently they firstly inherits the father code similarly to the above but adds a series of special self order number i e the use order of special mark is based on their catchment areas from large to small for example there are two l2 river segment converge into l1 river segment 01 in fig 3b the largest tributary is coded as 0101 while the small one is coded as 010① this special coding method is also worked in other schemes with one digit or three digit for each level in fig 3a and c 3 using the code the amazon watershed was examined for test our new approach mentioned above the amazon basin is the largest drainage basin in the world with an area of 6 million km2 approximately patel sorrentino et al 2002 it has a mass of tributaries such as the rio negro the rio solimoes the rio madeira etc gaillardet et al 1997 patel sorrentino et al 2002 in this section we firstly obtained and coded the river segments according our new method and then introduced the usages of river codes in identifying the relationship between river segments and the automatic coding procedure established in matlab software 3 1 obtain and code the river segment the rivers in the amazon basin were obtained using the arcgis software and srtm data we firstly acquired the srtm digital elevation data of amazon basin from usgs which has a spatial resolution of 90 m 90 m and then we used the stream burning method to modify the surface dem using the digital rivers drew manually according to the real river in google earth and then the correct digital river was obtained based on the modified dem applying several hydrological calculation processes in arcgis such as fill sinks remove peaks flow direction calculate flow accumulation and so on the accumulation threshold value for generating river was 123 456 about 1000 km2 which is according the stipulation for the major river in code for china river name ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2012 additionally the accumulation or contribution area of each river segment was obtained based on the flow accumulation data using the zonal statistic tool in arcgis according to the river level coding rule proposed in this study we determined the level and code of each river segment in the amazon river basin fig 5 based on the river network topology and flow accumulation the rule for defining rivers at level 1 to 5 was shown in table 2 and the other subsequent level was similar to l5 thus no more explained here while the tributaries that do not satisfy the above standard were neglected in this case study finally the rivers in the amazon basin were generated using the method mentioned above and the maximum river level is seven fig 5 there were totally 1 43 483 628 269 56 and 4 rivers for each level table 3 the river of l1 was divided into 32 segments by l2 river which were coded as 01 02 03 32 from junction to source the l2 river consisted of 525 segments for example the tributary of river segment 11 was divided into 12 segments coded as 1101 1102 1103 1112 the l3 river was split into 1111 segments for instance the tributary of river segment 1102 includes two segments coded as 110201 and 110202 and there were 897 325 60 and 4 segments for level 4 to 7 respectively the largest river segment code in the amazon basin is 14111101010101 at level 7 with fourteen digit numbers 3 2 identify the relationship between river segments a successful river coding method should have the ability of identifying the topological relationship between river segments coding automatically by computer and easily understood in fact the new method established in this study could achieve these functions 3 2 1 this new coding method could easily identify the upstream and downstream the river segments with an upstream and downstream relationship is defined as the river segments at same level and the water runs from the upstream into the downstream the particular identification steps are as follows first the number of digits in any selected river segment codes are compared to determine the level of these river segments taking the river code of the amazon river network for example fig 5 each level has two digit in its code if the number of digits of the selected river segment are equal it means they are at the same level second after removing the self order code last two digit number of their codes the father code stem code are compared if the father code are same it means that these selected segments drain into a same river and the segment with the bigger code is the upstream in addition these segments are connected directly if difference between the self order codes is 1 for example river segment 110202 is the direct upstream of segment 110201 3 2 2 this coding method could easily identify the neighborhood relationship the neighbor rivers are defined as several river segments at same river level and flow into a same river but without the upstream and downstream relationship the first step to find the river segments at same level is similar to the approach above in this second step however we mainly focused on the father code if the father codes have the upstream and downstream relationship or located in a same river it suggests that these selected river segments are belonged to two neighboring rivers i e brother or sister rivers for example river segments 110601 and 110501 in fig 5 are neighbor because their father codes 1106 and 1105 have the upstream and downstream relationship similarly river segments 0101 and 0201 are also neighborhood 3 2 3 this new coding method could identify the relationship of stem and branch the first step is also to compare the levels of selected river segments the river segment with more digit number has a higher level second taking the two digit coding scheme for example if the difference of digit number is 2 and the higher level code has inherited the code of lower level it indicates that the higher level river segment is a branch of the lower level in other words if the father code of higher level segment is as same as the code of lower level there exists a stem branch i e father son relationship between them for example 11050101 is a branch of 110501 in fig 5 because the difference of their code digit number i e 8 and 6 respectively is 2 and the higher segment inherits the digit number 110501 of the lower similarly 1201 is a son branch of 12 furthermore similar to the stem branch relationship if the number difference of digits is more than 2 it may be a relationship of grandparent grandchildren for example river segment 1105 is a kind of grandparent segment of 11050101 in fig 5 more clearly 1105 is the stem of 110501 which is also the stem of 11050101 it conforms to the principle above that the digital number difference is 4 between river segment 11050101 and 1105 i e 8 and 4 respectively and 11050101 inherits the code of 1105 3 2 4 this coding method could indicate the water flow path easily with the ability of inheriting father code and increasing self code the higher level segment inherits the code of the lower level segment and then the self ordering code increases away from the junction or mouth along the river therefore this coding method could indicate the river level and the topological position of each segment in the drainage network and show the water flow routine from the object segment to the watershed outlet the water flow route can be deduced easily through reducing the code number by 1 step by step taking the river segment 11050102 in fig 4 for example the water flow route is 11050102 11050101 110501 1105 1104 1103 1102 1101 11 10 09 08 07 06 05 04 03 02 01 outlet totally nineteen segments that water flows which is exactly the sum of digit numbers of different level in its code i e 11 05 01 02 19 3 3 encoding with pure digital number is benefit to automatically and fast computing the river code established in this paper is composed by pure digital number which is beneficial to the computer encoding automatically based on this method we have further developed a river network coding procedure using the matlab software and applied for the software copyright no 2018sr850878 this procedure could read the shapefile of river network created by arcgis and output the encoding result in shapefile directly it only uses a little of attribution of each river i e the form point end points and accumulation therefore it could encode the huge river basin with a fast speed and has no capacity limitation in theory for example it took only 17 26 s to encode all 3 022 river segments in the amazon basin using this procedure on my laptop thinkpad t470p cpu i7 7700hq ram 32g including the time of reading and writing the river network in shapefile and with the help of this procedure in fact we have created all of the river at level 1 to 4 in the world and open data can be found at figshare platform yan et al 2019 4 discussion a new river coding method to absorb the both advantages of tree like and pfafstetter river coding method has been described and applied to delineate and code the amazon river basin it has overcome many shortcomings of the existing methods with some outstanding advantages such as determining the river standard of different level individually transforming the river code length simply and supporting large watershed more precisely the main characteristics not all of our new method the tree like and the pfafstetter method are compared in below 4 1 the comparison with the tree like method this new established method based on the tree structure and hierarchical river segment code method has more advantages than the tree like method such as strahler order and binary tree codification method li et al 2010 first our method codes the river network from estuary to source the level 1 river is the river that links the outlet of the river basin the level 2 river is the branch of level 1 river and so on in contrast the strahler method code the river network from the source to the estuary the level 1 river is the source of the river and the two level 1 rivers converge to form a level 2 river and so on secondly the strahler order method is very famous for ordering the level of river networks but the application of its derived coding method is rarely unlike the strahler method our method could classify and code the river networks at the same time in addition the river code is assigned hierarchically with pure digital number and the river code could indicate the river level by simply counting the digit number of river code similar to the pfafstetter method stein 2018 for instance the level of river segment 11050101 is at level 4 in fig 5 by contrast the binary tree coding method with two elements bslength bsvalue for example is more complex the upstream code of 1 0 is 1 1 2 0 li et al 2010 finally the modified binary tree method is complex by adding a virtual binary tree liu et al 2014 4 2 the comparison with the pfafstetter coding method pfafstetter coding method originally invented for dividing the mining areas without considering the topological relationship of the river network verdin and verdin 1999 has some shortcomings in representing the river network stein 2018 taking the amazon river basin as example the river coding results by our new method and the pfafstetter coding method are showed below in figs 6 and 7 and the main differences between these two methods are compared and listed in table 4 including the aspects of level coding topological relationship and display of river network 4 2 1 level coding our coding method strictly follows the tree structure of the river network and absorbs the advantages of already exist coding methods therefore the level of each river section is fixed and hierarchically and the relationship of stem branch is clear moreover the code digital number length of each level river could be adjusted with the size of the river basin which has been mentioned in methodology section for example the river code at level 1 in our method could have one digital i e 1 two digitals i e 01 or three digitals i e 001 according to the number of branches in addition once the river network structure changed only the stem code or father code of the upstream branches should be adjusted successively for example if the branch 1401 is removed in fig 6 only its upstream branches i e 1501 1601 1701 should be changed in turn i e 1401 1501 1601 last but not least it supports the convergence of multiple branches and still keep the neatness of river network coding for example the stem of river segment 010① is 01 in fig 3 by contrast the pfafstetter coding method does not strictly follow the stem branch relationship of river network resulting in some difficulties in the hydrological applications firstly this method divides each region into nine sub regions including five main stream subregions and four branch subregions these subregions are at the same level which leads to a confusion between the mainstream and branch i e fig 7b secondly the level of the river section is not fixed for example the river at level 1 is also belong to level 2 and level n i e fig 7 thirdly all of river codes by pfafstetter coding method should be modified when one branch has changed or removed because four largest branches are judged and selected firstly to divide the region into 9 subregions and ordered with even number from outlet to source for example if the branch 18 in fig 7b was removed another branch will be choosing to replace it and all of the upstream river should be partitioned and reordered again in addition the code of the main stream section in pfafstetter coding method will be missing or not continuous in the multi branches convergence for example if branches 16 and 18 converge together in fig 7b the branch 17 may be discarded therefore the pfafstetter group rule is weak in fulfilling the multiple branches confluence situations liu et al 2014 4 2 2 topological relation our new method could work in all kinds of basins and indicate several topological relationships of river networks which is the basic and important function of river coding method firstly our method has no requirement for the size of the basin or the number of branches secondly the number of branches at different level in our method could be controlled by setting different threshold values individually which could retain all of the small branches or only the main branches i e fig 6 thirdly the code of the main stream is inherited by its tributaries and upstream in our method so it is very easy to find the relationships of stem branch and upstream downstream according to the river coding even in multiple branches converge situation for example the downstream of river section 15 is 14 in fig 8 a the same river by contrast in pfafstetter coding method is coded as 181 and its downstream should be river section 179 theoretically but in fact it is 173 in fig 8b in fact the pfafstetter coding method is too strict to the river network structure and could not indicate the topological relationship of upstream downstream and stem branch very well firstly the original pfafstetter coding method requires that the number of tributaries in each river basin at each level should be more than four only in this situation the river section coding can be regular and complete however the number of branches in a real river is often less than four which leads the codes irregular and loses the greatest advantage of this method secondly the pfafstetter coding method only chooses four largest branches of each region and neglect the others resulting in some larger branches not getting their proper levels and destroying the river network structure of the basin i e fig 7b thirdly the stem branch relationship is difficult to detect directly in the pfafstetter coding method even in its improved methods stein 2018 it is because the front part of river codes inherited from the river network coding is not the mainstream coding but the region code it belongs to for example the code 1 in the river 11 12 13 in fig 7b don t mean the code 1 of the mainsrtream of amazon river in fig 7a especially when the number of branches less than four it is difficult to judge the relationships of upstream downstream and stem branch such as the relationship between river section 181 and 173 mentioned before 4 2 3 map display our method strictly refers to the stem branch structure of river network and each river section has a fixed level therefore the river network of the whole basin can be displayed in a single map layer in our method i e fig 6 by contrast the river of different level in pfafstetter coding method is hierarchical and their levels are confusion resulting in they distributed in different map layers i e fig 7 4 3 some limitations and future research directions this new method could work in many situations whether the watershed is large or small multi branches converge or simple however this new method could not be applied for more complex situations such as the artificial channels and the braid rivers in flat regions especial near the basin outlet we just simplified them as a single river as the previous studies stein 2018 it is based on the 8d flow direction which assume the water in each grid dem has only one flow direction in fact there are some methods trying to describe the complex situations such as coding the reservoir and artificial channels song et al 2019 with the increasing impacts of reservoir irrigation water supply and urbanization construction process on river network and nature water cycle qiu et al 2019 zhou et al 2018 5 conclusions a river coding method that could effectively indicates the river network topology and be calculated automatically by computer is very critical to hydrological analysis this paper establishes a new river network coding method for better analysis of river topology and river network coding and then examined it in the amazon basin this method has absorbed the both advantages of the tree like and hierarchy river coding method notably it identifies the river level based on the topological structure of the river network encodes river segments with pure digital number and inherits the father code hierarchically the river coding results could easily identify the topological relationship of river segments control the density of the river network and suit for basins at different scales and the multi river convergence situation more importantly it has the advantages of having clear and stable river network topology coding speed fast supporting huge watershed modifying the coding result easily finally we hope this new method could benefit to the hydrological simulation research and suggest that more effort should be paid to improve the river coding

5943,river network coding is important for hydrological model on the aspects of water cycles simulation water resources evaluation and extreme hydrological events forecast however the existing river network coding methods had several disadvantages such as the river network coding structure is too complex to understand the river network topology is difficult to identify the river network coding capacity is limited to overcome the above mentioned shortcomings this paper proposed a new topological and hierarchical river coding method based on the river network created by the dem digital elevation method data and arcgis software this method systematically defines the river levels based on the hydrology structure from outlet to source the river directly flows into the watershed outlet is river l1 the branch of river l1 with a certain catchment area is river l2 the branch of l2 with a certain catchment area is river l3 and so on secondly we proposed a flexible coding scheme that encode the river segments with pure digital numbers hierarchically taking the two digits scheme for example the l1 river segments are coded with a sequence number such as 01 02 03 the l2 river segments inherit the river code from the l1 stem river segment add a serial of self order numbers 01 02 03 from the junction to the river source and become 0101 0102 0103 the process of coding the river segments at subsequent level is similar finally this new coding method was programmed in matlab software and successfully examined in the amazon river basin the world s largest watershed as a case study the results show that the new method is competent for easily controlling the river level and river segment density flexibly adjusting the code digital numbers to fit different basins with abundant or little rivers easily plotting the topological relationship automatically encoding by computer program and easily understood in a word this study is a useful attempt to create new river network coding method and it also has positive significance to promote the hydrological simulation research keywords river network hydrology structure hierarchy river coding multi flexible scheme tree like pfafstetter 1 introduction the river network division and coding is the foundation for distributed hydrological model a powerful tool for distributed hydrological simulation flood risk forecast and watershed management beighley et al 2015 qiu et al 2019 yoon and beighley 2015 supporting a variety of ecological and environmental activities beven 1993 radinger et al 2016 stein 2018 with the augmented demand of hydrological simulations under the changed environment building a fast and convenient watershed coding method is critical and a hot topic in hydrology research qiu et al 2019 luo et al 2006 nowadays a lot of coding methods has been established around the world liu et al 2014 these methods could mainly be divided into two categories tree like and hierarchy structure river coding methods for the tree like coding method it usually codes all of the river segments in a basin recursively based on the topological structure of river network the horton strahler scheme is probably the earliest tree like coding method in the word established by horton in 1932 and further developed by strahler horton 1932 moussa 2009 this method encodes the river level from the river source to the outlet and orders the first river segment at the river source as level 1 when multiple river segments converge to form a river segment it is assigned with a higher level number song et al 2019 although this method is still widely used today and integrated into arcgis software radinger et al 2016 it could not encode the position of river segments and sensitive to dem resolution and scales chavan and srinivas 2015 moussa 2009 other tree like river coding methods that could indicate both the level and code of river segment were subsequently proposed demir and szczepanek 2017 these methods code the river network from the river outlet to source and employ several elements to indicate the level and position of river segment for example the binary tree based and dyadic indicated coding method proposed by li et al 2006 applied two elements bslength bsvalue which presented the logical distance to the outlet of the watershed and the sequence number in its corresponding level of the binary tree respectively wang et al 2007 li et al 2006 it was further improved and extended to three elements in 2009 regionindex bslength bsvalue by adding an region elements to avoid causing computational overflow when the number of river segments is larger than 264 wang et al 2009 in 2014 the stem branch topological codification sbtc developed by liu et al liu et al 2014 included four element coding system o s b u which were outlet id code stem chain code branch chain code and upstream number code respectively liu et al 2014 it can be seen these tree like river coding methods have many advantages such as clearly expressing the river level characterizing the river s topological structure and hydraulic connection and displaying the rivers at different levels on one layer however their river code are complex usually consists of two or more code elements and could not clearly reflect the hierarchical relationship of rivers at different levels the hierarchical structure coding method compared to the tree like river coding method refers to a type of river coding method that divide the river network into several hierarchical levels and store them in different layers separately the most successful hierarchical structure river network coding method is the pfafstetter coding method established by a brazilian engineer otter pfafstetter in 1989 which characterized the hierarchical relationship of river network with a brief river code verdin and verdin 1999 this method usually divides the watershed into nine sub watersheds iteratively from large to small the four largest tributaries are assigned with even numbers i e 2 4 6 and 8 from the downstream to upstream and the corresponding five sub basins along the mainstem are assigned odd numbers i e 1 3 5 7 and 9 li et al 2010 the river in the higher level inherited the numerical code from its lower hierarchical level labeling with digits 1 to 9 at level 1 11 to 99 at level 2 111 to 999 at level 3 and so on verdin and verdin 1999 with the advantage of coding efficiently with pure digital number and nesting hierarchy which can be easily understood this method is the most widely used river coding method in the world currently such as the national water information system of usgs 1987 the french system used in africa south america europe and oceania 1968 the codification scheme defined by brazil hydroelectric power agency 1987 the hydro1k database 2001 the australian hydrological geospatial fabric 2014 the hydrologic derivatives for modeling and analysis 2017 and the main river code in china and so on jia et al 2006 usgs unitied states geological survey 2001 verdin 2017 in addition a large number of scholars have further improved the applicability of pfafstetter method such as dividing the watershed into more flexible parts to suit for different watershed with less or more than 4 tributaries and adding english alphabet for more meanings formetta et al 2011 stein 2018 however the pfafstetter method still has some shortcomings for hydrological analysis liu et al 2014 stein 2018 for example it neither distinguishes the stem tributary relationships strictly nor determines the level of river segment uniquely the efficiency decreases in identifying the topology when less than 9 division is applied li et al 2010 meanwhile it is difficult to splice split add and delete river segments liu et al 2014 therefore a robust coding method which could better reflect the topological relationship of drainage network facilitate the automatic calculation and easy to understood is need to meet these needs and absorb the advantages of two kinds of methods above we established a new river coding method which was based on the tree structure and code each river segment hierarchically with only one single digital coding element then this new method was implemented and tested in the amazon basin with the largest river basin and a mass of tributaries in the world for instance 2 methodology the new river network coding method established in this study mainly includes two parts identify river segment level and then code themselves the river segment code structure and variation are described in the following sections 2 1 identify the level of different rivers this method assumed that the river network conformed to the tree structure the main streams and tributaries of different level were identified hierarchically in fig 1 1 the river directly flows into the watershed outlet is river l1 level 1 as shown in the black line in fig 1a the stem of river l1 is identified based on the catchment area in tracing back process more specifically when judging two segments flowing together from outlet to source the river segment with a larger catchment area is regard as the stem and the smaller one as branch 2 river l2 level 2 is the branch of river l1 and has a contribution catchment area larger than a certain threshold the blue line in fig 1a while that smaller than this threshold was neglected and then the l2 stem is identified based on the catchment area of river segment from the confluence to source similarly to determination of the l1 stem above 3 river l3 is the branch of l2 that have a catchment area larger than the threshold of river l3 level 3 the yellow line in fig 1a successively the rivers of subordinate level were identified similarly such as the rivers l4 level 4 the green line in fig 1a and so on it should be noted that the threshold for each level river is very important and impact the structure of the river network de bartolo et al 2016 de bartolo et al 2009 which could change according to the research purpose and also could be replaced by other indicators such as flow and river length stein 2018 2 2 coding the river segment in this study based on the river level above we proposed a flexible river segment coding scheme and took two digits scheme for example fig 1b 1 the river l1 are partitioned into several l1 river segments by the junctions with its tributaries i e the l2 river and these l1 river segments are coded with a sequence number from the outlet to the source of the rive l1 such as 01 02 03 e g the black river segment codes in fig 1b 2 the l2 river segments are divided and obtained by its tributaries i e the l3 river as same as that of l1 the code of l2 river segment e g 0101 0102 includes two part the inherited father code and self ordering code the father code of l2 river segment code i e the first two digits inherited from the l1 stem river segment code e g 01 which it flows into and the self ordering code second two digits was created by a serial number 01 02 03 from the junction to the river source e g the blue river segment codes in fig 1b 3 in this scheme the river segment codes of higher level are firstly inherited the father code of lower level and then added a sequence number 01 02 03 similarly the river segment code for other levels are created subsequently e g the orange and green codes in fig 1b 2 3 the river segment code structure the new river segment code system established in this study is composed by pure digital number the structure of river segment code is legible in fig 2 taking the two digits scheme for example the first two digit x1x2 is the code of l1 the second two digit x3x4 is the code of l2 the third two digit x5x6 is the code of l3 and so on in other words the number of river segment code digits is as double as its level for example the segment 01020501 with eight digits represents the river segment is in level 4 while the river segment 0102 with four digits indicates the river segment is at level 2 in fact the river segment coding scheme that reserve two digits for each level is only suitable for the basin with total river segments less than 99 in its longest river the other coding system schemes for the basin with more or fewer river segments are discussed as follows 2 4 coding system variation the number of digits of each river segment code could been changed according to the maximum segment number of the longest river mn in different basin for mn less than 9 the digital number for each level could been shrunk into one to simplify the river code fig 3 a while for mn more than 100 and less than 1000 the digital number for each level could been extended into three digits to cover all of the river segments in a basin fig 3c fig 3 and table 1 show the description and comparison of these three river segment coding schemes i e one two and three digital number for each level for the special case of more than two branches converging into a same river segment one special number was applied to make them uniquely such as the number ① in fig 3 if a river segment has more than two tributaries the first two river segements with the largest catchment areas are regarded as the main stream and first tributary and coded normally using the river coding method established above however the other tributaries are coded differently they firstly inherits the father code similarly to the above but adds a series of special self order number i e the use order of special mark is based on their catchment areas from large to small for example there are two l2 river segment converge into l1 river segment 01 in fig 3b the largest tributary is coded as 0101 while the small one is coded as 010① this special coding method is also worked in other schemes with one digit or three digit for each level in fig 3a and c 3 using the code the amazon watershed was examined for test our new approach mentioned above the amazon basin is the largest drainage basin in the world with an area of 6 million km2 approximately patel sorrentino et al 2002 it has a mass of tributaries such as the rio negro the rio solimoes the rio madeira etc gaillardet et al 1997 patel sorrentino et al 2002 in this section we firstly obtained and coded the river segments according our new method and then introduced the usages of river codes in identifying the relationship between river segments and the automatic coding procedure established in matlab software 3 1 obtain and code the river segment the rivers in the amazon basin were obtained using the arcgis software and srtm data we firstly acquired the srtm digital elevation data of amazon basin from usgs which has a spatial resolution of 90 m 90 m and then we used the stream burning method to modify the surface dem using the digital rivers drew manually according to the real river in google earth and then the correct digital river was obtained based on the modified dem applying several hydrological calculation processes in arcgis such as fill sinks remove peaks flow direction calculate flow accumulation and so on the accumulation threshold value for generating river was 123 456 about 1000 km2 which is according the stipulation for the major river in code for china river name ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2012 additionally the accumulation or contribution area of each river segment was obtained based on the flow accumulation data using the zonal statistic tool in arcgis according to the river level coding rule proposed in this study we determined the level and code of each river segment in the amazon river basin fig 5 based on the river network topology and flow accumulation the rule for defining rivers at level 1 to 5 was shown in table 2 and the other subsequent level was similar to l5 thus no more explained here while the tributaries that do not satisfy the above standard were neglected in this case study finally the rivers in the amazon basin were generated using the method mentioned above and the maximum river level is seven fig 5 there were totally 1 43 483 628 269 56 and 4 rivers for each level table 3 the river of l1 was divided into 32 segments by l2 river which were coded as 01 02 03 32 from junction to source the l2 river consisted of 525 segments for example the tributary of river segment 11 was divided into 12 segments coded as 1101 1102 1103 1112 the l3 river was split into 1111 segments for instance the tributary of river segment 1102 includes two segments coded as 110201 and 110202 and there were 897 325 60 and 4 segments for level 4 to 7 respectively the largest river segment code in the amazon basin is 14111101010101 at level 7 with fourteen digit numbers 3 2 identify the relationship between river segments a successful river coding method should have the ability of identifying the topological relationship between river segments coding automatically by computer and easily understood in fact the new method established in this study could achieve these functions 3 2 1 this new coding method could easily identify the upstream and downstream the river segments with an upstream and downstream relationship is defined as the river segments at same level and the water runs from the upstream into the downstream the particular identification steps are as follows first the number of digits in any selected river segment codes are compared to determine the level of these river segments taking the river code of the amazon river network for example fig 5 each level has two digit in its code if the number of digits of the selected river segment are equal it means they are at the same level second after removing the self order code last two digit number of their codes the father code stem code are compared if the father code are same it means that these selected segments drain into a same river and the segment with the bigger code is the upstream in addition these segments are connected directly if difference between the self order codes is 1 for example river segment 110202 is the direct upstream of segment 110201 3 2 2 this coding method could easily identify the neighborhood relationship the neighbor rivers are defined as several river segments at same river level and flow into a same river but without the upstream and downstream relationship the first step to find the river segments at same level is similar to the approach above in this second step however we mainly focused on the father code if the father codes have the upstream and downstream relationship or located in a same river it suggests that these selected river segments are belonged to two neighboring rivers i e brother or sister rivers for example river segments 110601 and 110501 in fig 5 are neighbor because their father codes 1106 and 1105 have the upstream and downstream relationship similarly river segments 0101 and 0201 are also neighborhood 3 2 3 this new coding method could identify the relationship of stem and branch the first step is also to compare the levels of selected river segments the river segment with more digit number has a higher level second taking the two digit coding scheme for example if the difference of digit number is 2 and the higher level code has inherited the code of lower level it indicates that the higher level river segment is a branch of the lower level in other words if the father code of higher level segment is as same as the code of lower level there exists a stem branch i e father son relationship between them for example 11050101 is a branch of 110501 in fig 5 because the difference of their code digit number i e 8 and 6 respectively is 2 and the higher segment inherits the digit number 110501 of the lower similarly 1201 is a son branch of 12 furthermore similar to the stem branch relationship if the number difference of digits is more than 2 it may be a relationship of grandparent grandchildren for example river segment 1105 is a kind of grandparent segment of 11050101 in fig 5 more clearly 1105 is the stem of 110501 which is also the stem of 11050101 it conforms to the principle above that the digital number difference is 4 between river segment 11050101 and 1105 i e 8 and 4 respectively and 11050101 inherits the code of 1105 3 2 4 this coding method could indicate the water flow path easily with the ability of inheriting father code and increasing self code the higher level segment inherits the code of the lower level segment and then the self ordering code increases away from the junction or mouth along the river therefore this coding method could indicate the river level and the topological position of each segment in the drainage network and show the water flow routine from the object segment to the watershed outlet the water flow route can be deduced easily through reducing the code number by 1 step by step taking the river segment 11050102 in fig 4 for example the water flow route is 11050102 11050101 110501 1105 1104 1103 1102 1101 11 10 09 08 07 06 05 04 03 02 01 outlet totally nineteen segments that water flows which is exactly the sum of digit numbers of different level in its code i e 11 05 01 02 19 3 3 encoding with pure digital number is benefit to automatically and fast computing the river code established in this paper is composed by pure digital number which is beneficial to the computer encoding automatically based on this method we have further developed a river network coding procedure using the matlab software and applied for the software copyright no 2018sr850878 this procedure could read the shapefile of river network created by arcgis and output the encoding result in shapefile directly it only uses a little of attribution of each river i e the form point end points and accumulation therefore it could encode the huge river basin with a fast speed and has no capacity limitation in theory for example it took only 17 26 s to encode all 3 022 river segments in the amazon basin using this procedure on my laptop thinkpad t470p cpu i7 7700hq ram 32g including the time of reading and writing the river network in shapefile and with the help of this procedure in fact we have created all of the river at level 1 to 4 in the world and open data can be found at figshare platform yan et al 2019 4 discussion a new river coding method to absorb the both advantages of tree like and pfafstetter river coding method has been described and applied to delineate and code the amazon river basin it has overcome many shortcomings of the existing methods with some outstanding advantages such as determining the river standard of different level individually transforming the river code length simply and supporting large watershed more precisely the main characteristics not all of our new method the tree like and the pfafstetter method are compared in below 4 1 the comparison with the tree like method this new established method based on the tree structure and hierarchical river segment code method has more advantages than the tree like method such as strahler order and binary tree codification method li et al 2010 first our method codes the river network from estuary to source the level 1 river is the river that links the outlet of the river basin the level 2 river is the branch of level 1 river and so on in contrast the strahler method code the river network from the source to the estuary the level 1 river is the source of the river and the two level 1 rivers converge to form a level 2 river and so on secondly the strahler order method is very famous for ordering the level of river networks but the application of its derived coding method is rarely unlike the strahler method our method could classify and code the river networks at the same time in addition the river code is assigned hierarchically with pure digital number and the river code could indicate the river level by simply counting the digit number of river code similar to the pfafstetter method stein 2018 for instance the level of river segment 11050101 is at level 4 in fig 5 by contrast the binary tree coding method with two elements bslength bsvalue for example is more complex the upstream code of 1 0 is 1 1 2 0 li et al 2010 finally the modified binary tree method is complex by adding a virtual binary tree liu et al 2014 4 2 the comparison with the pfafstetter coding method pfafstetter coding method originally invented for dividing the mining areas without considering the topological relationship of the river network verdin and verdin 1999 has some shortcomings in representing the river network stein 2018 taking the amazon river basin as example the river coding results by our new method and the pfafstetter coding method are showed below in figs 6 and 7 and the main differences between these two methods are compared and listed in table 4 including the aspects of level coding topological relationship and display of river network 4 2 1 level coding our coding method strictly follows the tree structure of the river network and absorbs the advantages of already exist coding methods therefore the level of each river section is fixed and hierarchically and the relationship of stem branch is clear moreover the code digital number length of each level river could be adjusted with the size of the river basin which has been mentioned in methodology section for example the river code at level 1 in our method could have one digital i e 1 two digitals i e 01 or three digitals i e 001 according to the number of branches in addition once the river network structure changed only the stem code or father code of the upstream branches should be adjusted successively for example if the branch 1401 is removed in fig 6 only its upstream branches i e 1501 1601 1701 should be changed in turn i e 1401 1501 1601 last but not least it supports the convergence of multiple branches and still keep the neatness of river network coding for example the stem of river segment 010① is 01 in fig 3 by contrast the pfafstetter coding method does not strictly follow the stem branch relationship of river network resulting in some difficulties in the hydrological applications firstly this method divides each region into nine sub regions including five main stream subregions and four branch subregions these subregions are at the same level which leads to a confusion between the mainstream and branch i e fig 7b secondly the level of the river section is not fixed for example the river at level 1 is also belong to level 2 and level n i e fig 7 thirdly all of river codes by pfafstetter coding method should be modified when one branch has changed or removed because four largest branches are judged and selected firstly to divide the region into 9 subregions and ordered with even number from outlet to source for example if the branch 18 in fig 7b was removed another branch will be choosing to replace it and all of the upstream river should be partitioned and reordered again in addition the code of the main stream section in pfafstetter coding method will be missing or not continuous in the multi branches convergence for example if branches 16 and 18 converge together in fig 7b the branch 17 may be discarded therefore the pfafstetter group rule is weak in fulfilling the multiple branches confluence situations liu et al 2014 4 2 2 topological relation our new method could work in all kinds of basins and indicate several topological relationships of river networks which is the basic and important function of river coding method firstly our method has no requirement for the size of the basin or the number of branches secondly the number of branches at different level in our method could be controlled by setting different threshold values individually which could retain all of the small branches or only the main branches i e fig 6 thirdly the code of the main stream is inherited by its tributaries and upstream in our method so it is very easy to find the relationships of stem branch and upstream downstream according to the river coding even in multiple branches converge situation for example the downstream of river section 15 is 14 in fig 8 a the same river by contrast in pfafstetter coding method is coded as 181 and its downstream should be river section 179 theoretically but in fact it is 173 in fig 8b in fact the pfafstetter coding method is too strict to the river network structure and could not indicate the topological relationship of upstream downstream and stem branch very well firstly the original pfafstetter coding method requires that the number of tributaries in each river basin at each level should be more than four only in this situation the river section coding can be regular and complete however the number of branches in a real river is often less than four which leads the codes irregular and loses the greatest advantage of this method secondly the pfafstetter coding method only chooses four largest branches of each region and neglect the others resulting in some larger branches not getting their proper levels and destroying the river network structure of the basin i e fig 7b thirdly the stem branch relationship is difficult to detect directly in the pfafstetter coding method even in its improved methods stein 2018 it is because the front part of river codes inherited from the river network coding is not the mainstream coding but the region code it belongs to for example the code 1 in the river 11 12 13 in fig 7b don t mean the code 1 of the mainsrtream of amazon river in fig 7a especially when the number of branches less than four it is difficult to judge the relationships of upstream downstream and stem branch such as the relationship between river section 181 and 173 mentioned before 4 2 3 map display our method strictly refers to the stem branch structure of river network and each river section has a fixed level therefore the river network of the whole basin can be displayed in a single map layer in our method i e fig 6 by contrast the river of different level in pfafstetter coding method is hierarchical and their levels are confusion resulting in they distributed in different map layers i e fig 7 4 3 some limitations and future research directions this new method could work in many situations whether the watershed is large or small multi branches converge or simple however this new method could not be applied for more complex situations such as the artificial channels and the braid rivers in flat regions especial near the basin outlet we just simplified them as a single river as the previous studies stein 2018 it is based on the 8d flow direction which assume the water in each grid dem has only one flow direction in fact there are some methods trying to describe the complex situations such as coding the reservoir and artificial channels song et al 2019 with the increasing impacts of reservoir irrigation water supply and urbanization construction process on river network and nature water cycle qiu et al 2019 zhou et al 2018 5 conclusions a river coding method that could effectively indicates the river network topology and be calculated automatically by computer is very critical to hydrological analysis this paper establishes a new river network coding method for better analysis of river topology and river network coding and then examined it in the amazon basin this method has absorbed the both advantages of the tree like and hierarchy river coding method notably it identifies the river level based on the topological structure of the river network encodes river segments with pure digital number and inherits the father code hierarchically the river coding results could easily identify the topological relationship of river segments control the density of the river network and suit for basins at different scales and the multi river convergence situation more importantly it has the advantages of having clear and stable river network topology coding speed fast supporting huge watershed modifying the coding result easily finally we hope this new method could benefit to the hydrological simulation research and suggest that more effort should be paid to improve the river coding

5944,we investigated the changes in hydrologic response in a forested catchment impacted by wildfire in colorado u s a from the storm event to the inter annual scales we also evaluated the utility of a remotely sensed burn severity index to study post fire shifts in streamflow at the storm scale we evaluated hydrologic shifts through changes in the effective runoff q ptot peak streamflow qpk and response time tr tb from multiple hydrographs while at seasonal and inter annual scales we quantified hydrologic shifts through the runoff fraction q ptot and flow duration curves vegetation anomalies were monitored through comparisons of the normalized burn ratio nbr between the burned and a hydrologically similar forested neighboring unburned catchment we found short term acute and long term chronic transient streamflow shifts from the minute to the inter annual scales flow duration curves indicate an order of magnitude increase in maximum flows event average q ptot increased by two orders of magnitude and qpk increased by one order of magnitude relative to multiple representative pre fire events of similar precipitation intensities decreases in tr tb appear to be minimal at the inter annual scale increases in the difference between simultaneous unburned and burned nbr are associated with increases in q ptot a hydrologic recovery pathway is evident resembling a hysteresis effect driven by vegetation re growth results illustrate the non steady physical processes that increase flash flooding risks post fire in mountainous catchments and the utility of δnbr as a hydrologic predictor in ungauged watersheds keywords wildfire hydrology remote sensing hydrology normalized burn ratio post fire streamflow shifts forest hydrology land cover change 1 introduction quantifying the magnitude and temporal extent of streamflow shifts in recently burned mountain catchments is of primary interest due to the substantial increase in flash flooding and debris flow risks downstream of the burned areas this task is particularly challenging in ungauged topographically complex catchments prone to intense convective precipitation a significant amount of research has been devoted to this topic and several site specific factors such as regional climate zhou et al 2015 watershed terrain characteristics wine and cadol 2016 burn area and severity moody et al 2008 benyon and lane 2013 and vegetation species kuczera 1987 heath et al 2014 have been found to result in varying degrees of streamflow shifts in magnitude and longevity kinoshita and hogue 2015 despite previous work on using remote sensing indices to investigate changes in runoff production the utility of nbr to infer both short and long term hydrologic changes has not been fully evaluated linking vegetation burn severity and hydrologic anomalies becomes a relevant topic for water and land managers that often require site specific information on the expected duration and magnitude of fire induced streamflow shifts post fire streamflow shifts have occurred globally across various climatic conditions and spatiotemporal scales but mostly in the u s western states of california bart and hope 2010 kinoshita and hogue 2015 bart 2016 new mexico wine and cadol 2016 and colorado larson et al 2009 and also in portugal walsh et al 1994 spain cerdà and lasanta 2005 israel inbar et al 1998 and australia zhou et al 2015 three streamflow metrics are usually investigated as indicators of hydrologic anomalies 1 runoff volume helvey 1980 moody et al 2008 moody and ebel 2014 ebel et al 2012 2 peak streamflow moody and martin 2001b shakesby and doerr 2006 and 3 time to peak streamflow neary et al 2005 post fire runoff shifts have been evaluated from the plot benavides solorio and macdonald 2001 to the catchment scale moody et al 2008 such changes in runoff production generally occur because of the formation or enhancement of water repellant soils debano 2000 as well as significant decreases in vegetation density and litter cover cerdà and doerr 2005 the post fire conditions enhance infiltration excess runoff mechanisms shakesby and doerr 2006 that result in positive peak streamflow shifts gottfried et al 2003 macdonald and huffman 2004 stoof et al 2012 mahat et al 2016 moreno et al 2016 and shorter response times baker et al 2004 neary et al 2005 cydzik and hogue 2009 fire severity effects on vegetation and soil properties and their subsequent recovery play a significant role in the short acute and long term chronic hydrologic responses of a burned region cerdà 1998 in the case of long term behavior the post fire hydrologic restoration rates can vary from year to year depending on regional climatic and vegetation conditions shin et al 2013 previous studies have noted the strong coupling between soil vegetation and hydrologic recovery pathways usually finding this process to occur within 2 7 years post fire in tandem with the re establishment of vegetation stream network connectivity and soil hydraulic properties moody and martin 2001b cerdà and doerr 2005 wittenberg et al 2007 mayor et al 2007 although in certain cases it may take longer for instance kinoshita and hogue 2015 found elevated stream discharge during low flow seasons nearly ten years following a californian wildfire and attributed the elevated runoff to reduced transpiration remote sensing indices are used to investigate the severity and track recovery pathways after wildfires among commonly used indices to study ecosystem damage after fire are the enhanced vegetation index evi the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and the more recently developed normalized burn ratio nbr all are usually computed from landsat or modis imagery both evi and ndvi were essentially developed to track canopy structural variations and health thereby they can also be used to infer vegetation damage after fires wittenberg et al 2007 casady et al 2010 kinoshita and hogue 2011 wine and cadol 2016 uyeda et al 2017 however the application of evi and ndvi to study post fire vegetation alterations involves conceptual limitations related to the spectral bands that do not necessarily capture burn severity epting et al 2005 subsequently the nbr was defined to identify and quantify the effects of fire on vegetation by including the mid infrared band cocke et al 2005 epting et al 2005 roy et al 2006 walz et al 2007 loboda et al 2007 escuin et al 2008 weber et al 2008 the difference between consecutive pre and post fire scenes i e δnbr is usually taken to represent burn extent and severity miller and thode 2007 moody et al 2015 despite recent advances in the understanding of the relationship between post fire soil and vegetation recovery and the evolution of hydrologic shifts onda et al 2008 kinoshita and hogue 2011 further research remains necessary at the catchment scale woodsmith et al 2004 to relate the hydrologic anomalies to remotely sensed imagery using paired basin approaches innovations are particularly germane for application to ungauged basins post fire hydrologic shifts beyond the plot and hillslope scale were studied by several authors lane et al 2006 mayor et al 2007 heath et al 2014 wine and cadol 2016 bart and hope 2010 bart 2016 however catchment scale studies are less frequently found than plot or hillslope scale investigations and consequently streamflow dynamics at the watershed scale are less clearly understood under post fire conditions moody and martin 2001a mayor et al 2007 furthermore there is a paucity of post fire studies with hydrological records available both pre and post fire woodsmith et al 2004 kinoshita and hogue 2015 making it difficult to quantify streamflow shifts relative to unburned conditions this study investigates catchment scale hydrological shifts relative to unburned conditions at a predominantly forested catchment in colorado usa the broader research questions are 1 what are the potential links between basin average nbr and the observed post fire streamflow anomalies and 2 how could paired basin δnbr be used to quantify inter annual runoff alterations and hydrologic recovery post fire the focus of the study is on the use of remote sensing data to detect and track a basin s hydrologic response to wildfire impacts and to investigate the links with streamflow shifts through process based analyses pre and post fire catchment observations of precipitation streamflow and satellite derived nbr are used δnbr is computed from simultaneous burned and unburned paired catchments with the purpose of excluding the effects of vegetation phenology to infer changes due to the fire impacts that result in runoff generation shifts to account for the effects of severe weather within this mountain watershed analyses are conducted under warm season precipitation as measured by rain gauges situated within and nearby the catchment six years pre and post fire are analyzed as a representative period for precipitation and streamflow in regards to vegetation recovery while also ensuring a representative number of storm events to synthesize hydrologic patterns the objectives of this study are to 1 evaluate the utility of nbr in estimating transient shifts in runoff fraction peak streamflow and time to peak streamflow and 2 examine the coupled ecosystem hydrologic response post fire from the event to the inter annual scale by combining ground stations and remote sensing image analysis the focus will be on the camp creek catchment located within waldo canyon in colorado table 1 summarizes previous research and reports that have investigated the hydrological and societal impacts of the 2012 waldo canyon fire in colorado a unique and widely studied fire which also serves as a case study in the current paper 2 study area hydrology and remote sensing data 2 1 wildfire coverage and study area between june 23rd and july 10th of 2012 the waldo canyon fire burned over 74 km2 of land near colorado springs co the wildfire extent general area topography and vegetation distribution are shown in fig 1 and appendix a 1 the proximity of the fire to a large city colorado springs fig 1 enhanced the human impact of the waldo canyon fire damaging 346 homes and killing two people city of colorado springs 2013 the u s forest service s inter agency burn area emergency response baer team classified 28 of the burn area as very low severity 23 as low 29 as moderate and 20 high severity see fig a 1 camp creek is a 24 4 km2 catchment with 78 of its drainage area affected by this fire see fig 1 table 2 summarizes wildfire spatiotemporal characteristics within camp creek indicating burned area and wildfire period according to the baer team camp creek had 36 of the burn area as low severity 37 moderate severity and 5 high severity young and rust 2012 rosgen et al 2013 a neighboring unburned control catchment with similar topographic channel network and land cover characteristics is stanley creek this is a 9 km2 watershed located within 8 7 km distance from camp creek that was used as a control catchment for comparing unburned to burned i e camp creek nbr values see fig 1 table 3 documents geomorphic and land cover characteristics of the two burned and unburned catchments table 3 and fig 1 indicate that both camp and stanley creeks hold similar relief channel network distribution mean slope general aspect and vegetation cover additionally given the short distance that separates them they share similar climates such similarities result in similar spectral signatures of the nbr see section 4 1 the seasonality of precipitation in colorado s central mountains is complex with intense precipitation possible all year however during the warm season april to october the precipitation is likely to be convective and even under unburned conditions it can trigger instantaneous flood risk that is enhanced by the steep slopes of this region mahoney et al 2015 moreno et al 2012 2013 2 2 observed precipitation and streamflow data this study uses multi year data from three precipitation gauges and one streamflow gauge spanning the warm season april through october without snow events in the analysis of pre and post fire hydrologic patterns to emphasize rainfall driven responses fig 1 shows the regional location of the study gauge stations while table 4 illustrates station codes type measurement frequency and missing data and table 2 specifies the evaluation periods according to the data availability camp creek s main stream is ephemeral with zero flow values outside of active precipitation events it has 15 minute streamflow and 5 minute precipitation data available through the united states geological survey usgs national water information system and national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa cooperative observer program coop 2 3 remote sensing data this study uses mod13q1 modis imagery to calculate the nbr and quantify fire induced changes within the burned camp creek relative to the unburned stanley creek catchment while evi and ndvi are based on near infrared and visible light to quantify vegetation s density and health nbr enhances the distinction between burned and unburned surfaces with the addition of the mid infrared spectral band the mod13q1 modis provides imagery for calculating 16 day composites of nbr data at 250 m resolution and is available from february 2000 present nasa lp daac 2000 3 methods 3 1 evolution of catchment burn severity and streamflow pre and post fire nbr values were calculated from the near infrared nir and mid infrared mir modis bands roy et al 2006 for both camp and stanley creeks the phenologic cycles in the spectral signal of vegetation prevent the use of a single reference pre fire nbr image for camp creek to estimate nbr changes with respect to standard conditions instead comparing simultaneous nbr composites at paired camp creek and stanley creek catchments helps in isolating the effects of fire on vegetation from natural variability therefore a nbr time series analysis was conducted to determine if both i e burned and unburned catchment s spectral signal mean and variability preserved a high correlation coefficient during pre fire conditions lhermitte et al 2010 veraverbeke et al 2010 diaz delgado and pons 2001 veraverbeke et al 2010 further regression analysis was applied e g logarithmic exponential linear power law and polynomial to best fit the first two distributional moments during the 2006 through 2012 period the best predictor was used to adjust nbr values at stanley to camp creek pre fire and to forecast post fire nbr at camp creek as if it was unburned catchment average and standard deviation nbr values associated with the burned and unburned conditions were computed throughout the april october season over the evaluation period excluding any periods with observed snow on the ground in a typical year and for clear sky conditions a maximum of 14 average nbr composites 2 per month over the 7 month season were available δnbr was then computed as the difference between adjusted unburned and burned conditions at camp creek as illustrated by equation 1 diaz delgado and pons 2001 1 δ nbr t nbr unburned t nbr burned t where t is the simultaneous period for which the difference is calculated all terms represent catchment average values nbrunburned and nbrburned correspond to the adjusted nbr from stanley creek and the simultaneous values at camp creek respectively although this difference i e δnbr only makes sense post fire the calculation pre fire should yield values close to zero as a way to ensure that both adjusted and actual nbr values were very similar pre fire theoretically δnbr ranges from 2 negative two indicating healthier vegetation and 2 positive two for high severity burn with 0 zero meaning conditions similar to pre fire this methodology facilitated the tracking of post fire vegetation recovery relative to the unburned conditions under similar climatic conditions flow duration curves fdcs are widely used to study exceedance probabilities of mean and extreme hydrologic values in some cases they have also been used to evaluate the effects of catchment disturbances on flow distribution providing statistical information on streamflow variability lane et al 2005 lane et al 2006 kinoshita and hogue 2015 fdcs were created for the pre and post fire study periods in camp creek using daily average streamflow data to identify fire related shifts in streamflow frequency distribution 3 2 cross scale temporal streamflow shifts the subsequent event scale analyses incorporated δnbr by using the average values associated with the closest in time 16 day composite of each month depending on the date of the streamflow event similarly the seasonal and inter annual scale analyses took the average of each year s 14 nbr composites to compute δnbr between the burned and unburned vegetation regarding the streamflow metrics event daily and seasonal scale values were computed to assess runoff changes post fire relative to pre fire conditions event scale calculations were conducted for a total of 76 hydrologic events 38 associated with pre fire and another 38 with post fire conditions table 2 summarizes the pre fire and post fire time spans all periods with snowfall or presence of snow on the ground were removed from the analyses to ensure that initial soil moisture conditions were low events with minimal precipitation p 3 mm five days prior were selected so that the hydrologic effects due to land cover change rather than high antecedent soil moisture could be isolated fig 2 illustrates a typical response hydrograph where q represents the total streamflow through the basin outlet as a result of both base flow qb and event flow q q represents the total water volume per unit catchment area as a result of the precipitation depth ptot a graphical base flow separation method was used to divide response hydrographs between qb and q fig 2 dingman 2015 at the monthly and seasonal scales q represents the total streamflow volume leaving the catchment through its outlet as a result of a monthly or seasonal precipitation input ptot calculations for the monthly and seasonal q and ptot are made for the months and seasons associated with each of the 78 maximum hydrologic events in camp creek based on those streamflow metrics four comparative streamflow response metrics were used a event effective runoff per unit precipitation q ptot mm mm b event peak streamflow qpk m3 s c event time to peak fraction of hydrograph base time tr tb min min and d monthly and seasonal runoff coefficient q ptot mm mm high values of q ptot and qpk represent high runoff yields and maximum flows small values of tr tb indicate a faster paced hydrograph rise whereas larger values are associated with a slower rise this cross scale analysis facilitated the assessment of acute and chronic post fire anomalies in runoff production per unit drainage area and precipitation depth so that runoff changes could be mostly attributed to vegetation alterations produced within the burn scars 3 3 streamflow shifts and burn severity links in order to explore the co dependence of q ptot qpk and tr tb with event precipitation properties such as precipitation total ptot average and maximum intensity iave and imax and land cover change due to burn severity i e δnbr a variance contribution approach was applied including the76 study events first scatterplots and correlation coefficients between pairs of imax ptot and iavg were calculated to assess their level of independence prior to the application of the variance contribution analysis then q ptot qpk and tr tb were plotted against δnbr with regards to their ptot imax and iavg to investigate the potential links among groups of three variables e g q ptot δnbr and ptot empirical density distributions were plotted and kolmogorov smirnov tests were conducted in regards to the pre and post fire distributions subsequently a variance contribution analysis was conducted for variable arrays containing each of the event streamflow properties q ptot qpk and tr tb and all other independent variables including precipitation characteristics and δnbr imax ptot iavg and δnbr the method includes all measured predictors into multiple linear combinations to find a subset that explains the highest percent of the variance in the predictands best subsets heinze et al 2018 olejnik et al 2000 is a technique that relies on exhaustive searches for the best groups of the variables using an efficient branch and bound algorithm the procedure fits 2p i e 16 models where p 4 is the number of predictors in the dataset the akaike information criterion aic akaike 1973 and the coefficient of determination r2 facilitate model selection by providing an estimator of the relative quality of statistical models for a given set of data results are presented in pie charts model regression plots and tables for pre and post fire events finally inter annual q ptot were analyzed relative to simultaneous δnbr values to identify recovery patterns of vegetation properties and their potential controls on runoff production at camp creek 4 results 4 1 evolution of catchment burn severity and streamflow pre and post fire a sequence of nbr field values from may 2012 pre fire month and august 2012 post fire month and their corresponding nbrmay nbraug difference illustrates the effects that fire had on vegetation in the waldo canyon region see fig 3 in fig 3 a and 3 b nbr values range between 1 and 1 pre and post fire with an evident shift to negative values post fire indicating removal of vegetation by fire the nbrmay nbraug difference illustrates changes of up to 2 nbr units in the most severely burned areas of camp creek the pre fire average basin values of nbr i e nbrmay for camp creek and stanley creek are 0 24 and 0 29 respectively for post fire conditions the average nbraug for camp creek is 0 03 while the unburned value for stanley is 0 36 nbr regression analysis found that either linear logarithmic or polynomial models provided the same coefficient of determination r2 0 80 between simultaneous catchment average values at camp and stanley creeks during the 2006 through 2012 pre fire period see table b 1 a linear model was then selected to express nbr at camp creek as a function of the values at stanley creek as shown by figs b 1 and b 2 this results in synthetic time series of nbr at camp creek as if it was unburned thereby facilitating the comparison of burned and unburned conditions for post fire events within camp creek time series of daily total precipitation p bi weekly mean and standard deviation nbr and daily average streamflow q over camp creek catchment are shown in fig 4 during the 12 year evaluation period for reference stanley creek s adjusted mean nbr time series have also been added to fig 4 seasonally nbr peaks in late july and early august of each year the waldo canyon wildfire abruptly decreases the post fire camp creek s catchment average nbr and increases its spatial variability as reflected by the larger standard deviation bars however after fire nbr follows a recovery pathway gradually increasing each year further nbr s spatial variability appears to decrease faster returning to pre fire values in about three years after the wildfire event in camp creek the pre fire i e 2006 2012 and post fire i e 2012 2018 mean seasonal precipitation values were 357 and 416 mm respectively this difference can be explained by the exceptionally dry year of 2012 year of the wildfire with a precipitation total of 256 mm and the exceptionally wet year of 2015 with 663 mm of precipitation in general camp creek showed lower streamflow responses to precipitation events pre fire fig 4 changes in discharge are evident post fire the magnitude of streamflow events increased significantly post fire with the largest pre fire qpk over the 2006 2012 period being 0 26 m3 s while the largest post fire qpk of 10 42 m3 s occurred in may of 2015 almost three years after the fire equivalent to at least an order of magnitude increase with respect to the maximum qpk which occurred during the pre fire period similar peak streamflow events occurred the same year and month after the wildfire in july of 2012 8 64 m3 s and one year later in august of 2013 6 54 m3 s warm season flow duration curves fdcs are created from daily average streamflow data for the pre and post fire study periods and indicate changes in camp creek s flow regime post fire fig 5 fdcs over a 20 year pre fire time period 1992 2012 are used as the baseline to quantify fire impacts pre and post fire fdcs are not distributed over the entire range of exceedance probabilities because camp creek is an ephemeral stream the rightward shift of the post fire fdc indicates that all portions of the flow regime are affected by burn scars and the streamflow at each probability value is on average an order of magnitude larger across the range of probabilities high flows flows at 1 exceedance probability smakhtin 2001 increase from 0 74 m3 s pre fire to 2 5 m3 s post fire low flows flows 99 exceedance probability brown et al 2005 do not increase in magnitude remaining at 0 m3 s post fire however the shift in streamflow distribution post fire indicates that the number of zero flow days slightly decreased throughout the 20 years prior to the wildfire zero flow days occurred 88 9 of the time and over the 6 year post fire time span this value decreased to 85 7 for a difference of 3 2 reduction in zero flow days 4 2 cross scale temporal streamflow shifts this section synthetizes the observed wildfire induced streamflow shifts from the event to seasonal time scales fig 6 illustrates the pre and post fire q ptot for 76 hydrologic events 38 pre and 38 post fire and their associated daily and monthly average q ptot symbols are colored by their corresponding total precipitation ptot mm a summary of the mean absolute and relative changes between pre and post fire values at each temporal scale is shown in table 5 fig 6 and table 5 indicate increases in effective runoff per unit precipitation from the event to the monthly time scales nonetheless the largest difference in runoff between pre and post fire is observed at the event scale with two orders of magnitude i e 102 higher values than pre fire see table 5 increases in streamflow magnitudes occur across a wide range of precipitation totals 4 3 streamflow shift links with burn severity this section illustrates the differing hydrologic response patterns between pre and post fire conditions for individual precipitation events at camp creek and the role of burn severity on the observed acute event and chronic inter annual streamflow shifts fig 7 provides an example case of the corresponding response hydrographs for two such events that are similar in ptot and iavg fig 7 b illustrates a post fire storm event with a ptot of 27 6 mm and iavg of 6 12 mm hr that produced a qpk of 8 64 m3 s and a q ptot of 0 85 these values i e qpk and q ptot are at least one and two orders of magnitude respectively larger than the pre fire values shown in fig 7 a the total precipitation five days prior to each event is 1 2 mm pre fire and 3 1 mm post fire indicating that the antecedent soil moisture between the two events is similar the nature and properties of precipitation play a definitive role on the magnitude and pace of the response hydrograph and this is the reason why the following results are illustrated in terms of imax iavg and ptot to expand on the analysis of q ptot qpk and tr tb for the pre and post fire study events fig 8 illustrates their relationships with δnbr and classifies according to precipitation properties i e ptot imax iavg for the 76 pre and post fire storm events to help understand average pre and post fire behaviors table 6 further synthetizes event based mean absolute and relative hydrograph shifts from fig 8 and table 6 it can be inferred that at the event scale and for a wide range of ptot imax and iavg values increases in two orders of magnitude i e 102 on q ptot are observed post fire relative to pre fire conditions similarly increases of one order of magnitude i e 101 on qpk occur on average across a large spectrum of ptot imax and iavg additionally tr tb only shows a reduction of 10 relative to pre fire conditions illustrating a slight decrease on the average time to peak relative to pre fire conditions besides δnbr ptot and iavg appear to contribute to the variability of all three streamflow metrics i e q ptot qpk and tr tb often regulating i e enhancing or reducing the effect of δnbr for instance for a moderate precipitation event e g moderate ptot or iavg under a high δnbr high q ptot qpk and low tr tb tend to occur however a similar situation will occur under moderate δnbr in the presence of high ptot and iavg both scenarios result in an increase of streamflow values a further look to the probability density functions fig 9 and kolmogorov smirnov k s tests table 7 illustrate that precipitation properties e g ptot imax iavg do not appear to change significantly from pre to post fire except for a possible reduction in average intensity iavg fig 9 and table 7 post fire contrastingly δnbr distributions and k s test illustrate an evident right ward increasing shift post fire fig 9 d and table 7 the density functions of post fire q ptot and qpk are also right shifted relative to pre fire fig 9 e f and table 7 the shifts in the distribution of tr tb cannot be clearly identified fig 9 g table 7 precipitation characteristics i e ptot imax iavg do not seem to be strongly correlated as shown by fig c 1 the variance contribution results shown in fig 10 and further detailed in fig d 1 and table d 1 help quantify the relationships between burn severity precipitation properties and hydrologic response both pre and post fire for the pre fire events precipitation related predictors contribute in 98 ptot and iavg 73 ptot and iavg and 100 ptot and imax to the total variability that is possible to explain of each predictand q ptot qpk and tr tb see table d 1 when the four predictors are included within the best possible linear model combinations contrastingly for the post fire condition and except for tr tb δnbr displaces all precipitation properties as the main driver of hydrologic response contributing 82 and 79 to the explained variability of q ptot and qpk respectively consistent to previous results tr tb remains mostly controlled by ptot at the inter annual scale burn scars undergo a recovery process with vegetation re growth eventually leading to canopy densities similar to pre fire conditions in the absence of species replacement or succession and as this process occurs a hysteresis effect on the values of q ptot is observed fig 11 illustrates this process through seasonal average q ptot plotted against the corresponding seasonal average δnbr throughout the inter annual catchment s evaluation period fig 11 shows that the pre fire years 2007 through 2011 present low values with δnbr ranging between 0 015 and 0 015 and relatively low q ptot values except by 2007 and 2010 between 2011 and the 2012 fire year an increase in δnbr from 0 015 in 2011 to 0 26 in 2012 is associated with an increase in q ptot from 0 0003 to 0 02 in 2012 with this period being one of the driest in terms of low seasonal precipitation i e 122 mm the 2013 2017 seasonal sequence indicates a trend toward decreasing δnbr values although runoff efficiencies remain higher than many of the pre fire years shown 5 discussion 5 1 evaluating post fire hydrologic response shifts through nbr previous studies have described post fire anomalies and their relation to remotely sensed indices moody et al 2008 kinoshita and hogue 2011 benyon and lane 2013 moody et al 2015 for example moody et al 2008 2015 linked pre and post fire δnbr to short term soil hydraulic alterations and anomalies in peak streamflows post fire kinoshita and hogue 2011 evaluated the annual evolution in runoff production of a burned watershed in california but using time series of the evi in an effort to quantify vegetation recovery jin et al 2012 used multi year times series of nbr to evaluate changes in forest albedo the results presented in this manuscript represent the first effort to systematically evaluate the utility of nbr to reveal transient hydrologic catchment responses observed at multiple temporal scales i e from event to inter annual for up to six years of vegetation regrowth in this study catchment scale hydrologic response to fire was evaluated for a large sample i e 76 of precipitation events and seasonal totals that were similar to pre fire values in an ephemeral mountainous forested catchment a six year pre fire time period provided a comparison timeframe to evaluate the shifts in hydrologic response at the watershed scale regarding the first research question results showed that a drop in the catchment average satellite derived normalized burned ratio nbr is accompanied by an increase in the amount of effective runoff contributing to larger magnitude streamflow responses in volume and peak flow rate suggesting a degree of coupling between burn severity and hydrologic response additionally flow frequencies showed a consistent shift toward a larger range of exceedance probabilities post fire also indicating a slight decrease in the number of zero flow days with respect to the 20 years of record previous to the wildfire date in 2012 previous studies had observed this effect from single events or a smaller sample of events stoof et al 2012 verdin et al 2012 young and rust 2012 rosgen et al 2013 the influence of burn severity on vegetation propagates from the minute to the inter annual time scales indicating that the mechanisms of runoff generation endure for a significant period of time post fire regardless of the precipitation characteristics the associated increases in volume and flow rates are suggestive of enhanced infiltration excess overland flow mayor et al 2007 three particular events in april and may of 2010 show large runoff efficiencies similar to post fire events we hypothesize these could be due to a prolonged snow melt period extending from late april to early may out of the three evaluation metrics i e q ptot qpk and tr tb q ptot was the most significantly affected for all precipitation events post fire this means that the efficiency of runoff volume production is significantly enhanced regardless of the precipitation total from the storm to the seasonal scales this result is similar to previous studies investigating fire impacts on stream hydrology kinoshita and hogue 2015 also noted elevated streamflow during low flow seasons for up to 10 years post fire producing a newly perennial system however the increase in peak streamflow shown in camp creek s post fire was not observed in lane et al 2006 or kinoshita and hogue 2015 the reasons both studies provide for this is the rapid breakdown or altogether absence of fire induced soil hydrophobicity on the other hand although cydzik and hogue 2009 found significant reductions in basin lag time for six large to moderate post fire runoff events attributing the change to reduced infiltration associated with loss of vegetation and increased imperviousness the present study did not find significant changes in the time to peak flow relative to the total time base of the hydrographs one reason for this could be the ephemeral condition of camp creek added to the relative small size of the catchment as compared to larger watersheds studied by cydzik and hogue in answering the second science question related to the utility of δnbr to quantify inter annual runoff alterations and hydrologic recovery post fire the development of a variance contribution analysis provided further element tools to link satellite derived burned severity to the observed shifts in hydrologic response for the case of this single wildfire event no direct mathematical relations were found to exactly predict the magnitude of expected change for particular combinations of δnbr ptot imax or iavg nonetheless the cross scale analyses conducted outlined that observed event scale shifts in watershed stream response characteristics are found to shape longer term runoff ratios post wildfire further post fire vegetation recovery is a key determinant in the evolution of runoff as noted by wittenberg et al 2007 casady et al 2009 and kinoshita and hogue 2011 that conducted their analyses through time series of δevi we selected paired basin δnbr as it removes the effects of phenology and enhances the distinction between burned and unburned surfaces with the addition of the mid infrared spectral band as δnbr decreased several months after the wildfire occurred seasonal average runoff began recovering toward pre fire values following a hysteresis pattern see fig 11 with the burn severity but also precipitation depth as exemplified by the exceptionally wet year of 2015 very strong positive enso phases like the one in 2015 enhance the effect of fire severity through significant increases in q ptot of up to at least one order of magnitude relative to runoff fractions during post fire years the waldo canyon fire was a rather severe wildfire judging by the long recovery time relative to normal year hydrologic e g non enso 2008 2009 2010 pre fire conditions we argue that this hysteresis effect rules post fire hydrologic responses as measured by q ptot and possibly also qpk the time and magnitude of such an effect depends on the severity of the burn and vegetation species pre and post fire while a clear mathematical or statistical relationship between the δnbr q ptot and qpk was not found the balance of evidence shows correlation between hydrologic response properties and δnbr the lack of identifying a clear relation can be attributed to the highly complex watershed response processes and their feedbacks that rule post fire runoff responses additional factors include antecedent soil moisture conditions and snow processes but also differences in soil hydraulic properties determined by the short term presence of an ash layer woods and balfour 2010 ebel et al 2012 as noted by previous authors post fire event runoff generating processes and magnitudes are dynamic shakesby and doerr 2006 larson et al 2009 and therefore cannot likely be captured by a single vegetation metric although the results presented herein are based on a single basin s response the study underlines the potential use of paired basin δnbr for process understanding and predicting acute and chronic anomalies in vegetation and runoff and their linked recovery after a wildfire event along with precipitation characteristics and antecedent soil moisture conditions nbr is useful in determining mean expected shifts in effective runoff and peak streamflow from the event to the inter annual time scales nbr can also be used to reveal the vegetation recovery pathway that restores hydrologic conditions i e hysteresis curve demonstrating its usability to track the evolution of the annual runoff anomalies relative to pre fire conditions despite no straightforward relations being found between precipitation characteristics antecedent soil moisture and burn severity the findings of this study are of utility to hyper resolution process based modelers including the newly developed national water model gochis et al 2018 that account for time evolving vegetation and land cover status linking satellite derived indices to such hydrologic response metrics could also result in improvements of the rainfall runoff hydrograph calculation methods e g u s natural resources conservation service scs method and or unit and synthetic hydrographs after a wildfire event in an operational context land managers and decision makers could rely on the usability of nbr and δnbr to better monitor understand and estimate both event and long term responses of burned watersheds particularly those that are ungauged 6 study scope and limitations results provide consistent evidence of the exacerbated post fire runoff responses and their occurrence from the hourly to the inter annual time scales however inherent uncertainties arise when taking a lumped approach to vegetation dynamics for example within burn heterogeneity might play a role in enhancing or inhibiting water flow connectivity after fire a distributed approach could help shed light on the post fire vegetation dynamics of each sub catchment which might not be well captured by the catchment average δnbr additionally uncertainties are likely to influence results when three point based rain gauges are applied to analyze catchment scale streamflow dynamics spatially distributed bias corrected radar based precipitation data is preferred when quantifying catchment scale streamflow dynamics because it provides an estimation of rainfall spatial variability with respect to the burned areas further the present study did not explicitly consider the effects of the fire severity on the soil hydraulic properties as directly measured from the terrain these results underscore the importance of in situ soil measurements and field validated data for storm scale hydrologic projections 7 conclusions acute short term and chronic long term 6 years post fire transient streamflow shifts caused by wildfires are evaluated for a forested mountain catchment under warm season precipitation along with the quantified shifts the utility of the remotely sensed normalized burn ratio nbr is explored and quantified from the event to inter annual scales to study the transient post fire changes in streamflow results can be summarized as 1 observed reductions in nbr due to wildfire are concurrent with increases in runoff production i e q ptot under similar event precipitation depths intensities and antecedent soil moisture conditions 2 daily average flow duration curves show increases of an order of magnitude in the maximum streamflow values for the same exceedance probability events 3 increases in effective runoff q ptot and runoff fraction q ptot are observed at the event daily monthly and seasonal scales for similar precipitation totals pre and post fire the largest absolute increase in runoff production is observed at the event scale q ptot increases in two orders of magnitude in average indicating a significant shift in flash flood probability post fire 4 of the three response hydrograph metrics q ptot and qpk were the ones that illustrated the largest positive changes this indicates that regardless of the precipitation type or intensity enhanced runoff generation mechanisms were able to transform available precipitation into quick flow resulting in taller wider response hydrographs the response time was not necessarily identified as a critical shift variable in this catchment meaning that travel and residence times may not necessarily be affected by wildfires on ephemeral catchments of this type 5 density distributions and k s tests showed significant positive shifts for δnbr q ptot and qpk post fire despite ptot iavg imax showed average decreases from a set of storm events analyzed post fire 6 a variance contribution analysis further supports the strong dependence of hydrologic responses on precipitation properties pre fire but δnbr was a primary contributor on post fire hydrologic response 7 a hysteresis effect was found at the inter annual scale between the seasonal runoff fraction i e q ptot δnbr and ptot that illustrates the strong controls of soil and vegetation conditions on the corresponding runoff production at multiple temporal scales post fire for this particular case 6 years of vegetation re growth and soil hydraulic recovery post fire are not enough time to return to pre fire hydrologic conditions as the runoff mechanisms enhanced by the wildfire are still producing larger streamflow values comparable to pre fire years with exceptional rainfall or snow seasons 8 in summary paired basin δnbr was found to be of high utility for hydrologic analyses as it indicated vegetation status through its temporal correlation with the efficiency of runoff generation this finding supports the hypothesis that the remotely sensed δnbr could potentially be used to gain process understanding and improve predictions in burned basins as they are susceptible to yielding much greater runoff ratios than what is expected during pre fire conditions δnbr can also be used to monitor the basin s vegetation and hydrologic response recovery and improve transient modeling of the effects of vegetation status on hillslope and channel runoff future work could focus on conducting physically based distributed hydrologic observations and modeling to disaggregate the spatio temporal variability of runoff generating mechanisms that are responsible for the shifts observed across the temporal scales illustrated in this

5944,we investigated the changes in hydrologic response in a forested catchment impacted by wildfire in colorado u s a from the storm event to the inter annual scales we also evaluated the utility of a remotely sensed burn severity index to study post fire shifts in streamflow at the storm scale we evaluated hydrologic shifts through changes in the effective runoff q ptot peak streamflow qpk and response time tr tb from multiple hydrographs while at seasonal and inter annual scales we quantified hydrologic shifts through the runoff fraction q ptot and flow duration curves vegetation anomalies were monitored through comparisons of the normalized burn ratio nbr between the burned and a hydrologically similar forested neighboring unburned catchment we found short term acute and long term chronic transient streamflow shifts from the minute to the inter annual scales flow duration curves indicate an order of magnitude increase in maximum flows event average q ptot increased by two orders of magnitude and qpk increased by one order of magnitude relative to multiple representative pre fire events of similar precipitation intensities decreases in tr tb appear to be minimal at the inter annual scale increases in the difference between simultaneous unburned and burned nbr are associated with increases in q ptot a hydrologic recovery pathway is evident resembling a hysteresis effect driven by vegetation re growth results illustrate the non steady physical processes that increase flash flooding risks post fire in mountainous catchments and the utility of δnbr as a hydrologic predictor in ungauged watersheds keywords wildfire hydrology remote sensing hydrology normalized burn ratio post fire streamflow shifts forest hydrology land cover change 1 introduction quantifying the magnitude and temporal extent of streamflow shifts in recently burned mountain catchments is of primary interest due to the substantial increase in flash flooding and debris flow risks downstream of the burned areas this task is particularly challenging in ungauged topographically complex catchments prone to intense convective precipitation a significant amount of research has been devoted to this topic and several site specific factors such as regional climate zhou et al 2015 watershed terrain characteristics wine and cadol 2016 burn area and severity moody et al 2008 benyon and lane 2013 and vegetation species kuczera 1987 heath et al 2014 have been found to result in varying degrees of streamflow shifts in magnitude and longevity kinoshita and hogue 2015 despite previous work on using remote sensing indices to investigate changes in runoff production the utility of nbr to infer both short and long term hydrologic changes has not been fully evaluated linking vegetation burn severity and hydrologic anomalies becomes a relevant topic for water and land managers that often require site specific information on the expected duration and magnitude of fire induced streamflow shifts post fire streamflow shifts have occurred globally across various climatic conditions and spatiotemporal scales but mostly in the u s western states of california bart and hope 2010 kinoshita and hogue 2015 bart 2016 new mexico wine and cadol 2016 and colorado larson et al 2009 and also in portugal walsh et al 1994 spain cerdà and lasanta 2005 israel inbar et al 1998 and australia zhou et al 2015 three streamflow metrics are usually investigated as indicators of hydrologic anomalies 1 runoff volume helvey 1980 moody et al 2008 moody and ebel 2014 ebel et al 2012 2 peak streamflow moody and martin 2001b shakesby and doerr 2006 and 3 time to peak streamflow neary et al 2005 post fire runoff shifts have been evaluated from the plot benavides solorio and macdonald 2001 to the catchment scale moody et al 2008 such changes in runoff production generally occur because of the formation or enhancement of water repellant soils debano 2000 as well as significant decreases in vegetation density and litter cover cerdà and doerr 2005 the post fire conditions enhance infiltration excess runoff mechanisms shakesby and doerr 2006 that result in positive peak streamflow shifts gottfried et al 2003 macdonald and huffman 2004 stoof et al 2012 mahat et al 2016 moreno et al 2016 and shorter response times baker et al 2004 neary et al 2005 cydzik and hogue 2009 fire severity effects on vegetation and soil properties and their subsequent recovery play a significant role in the short acute and long term chronic hydrologic responses of a burned region cerdà 1998 in the case of long term behavior the post fire hydrologic restoration rates can vary from year to year depending on regional climatic and vegetation conditions shin et al 2013 previous studies have noted the strong coupling between soil vegetation and hydrologic recovery pathways usually finding this process to occur within 2 7 years post fire in tandem with the re establishment of vegetation stream network connectivity and soil hydraulic properties moody and martin 2001b cerdà and doerr 2005 wittenberg et al 2007 mayor et al 2007 although in certain cases it may take longer for instance kinoshita and hogue 2015 found elevated stream discharge during low flow seasons nearly ten years following a californian wildfire and attributed the elevated runoff to reduced transpiration remote sensing indices are used to investigate the severity and track recovery pathways after wildfires among commonly used indices to study ecosystem damage after fire are the enhanced vegetation index evi the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and the more recently developed normalized burn ratio nbr all are usually computed from landsat or modis imagery both evi and ndvi were essentially developed to track canopy structural variations and health thereby they can also be used to infer vegetation damage after fires wittenberg et al 2007 casady et al 2010 kinoshita and hogue 2011 wine and cadol 2016 uyeda et al 2017 however the application of evi and ndvi to study post fire vegetation alterations involves conceptual limitations related to the spectral bands that do not necessarily capture burn severity epting et al 2005 subsequently the nbr was defined to identify and quantify the effects of fire on vegetation by including the mid infrared band cocke et al 2005 epting et al 2005 roy et al 2006 walz et al 2007 loboda et al 2007 escuin et al 2008 weber et al 2008 the difference between consecutive pre and post fire scenes i e δnbr is usually taken to represent burn extent and severity miller and thode 2007 moody et al 2015 despite recent advances in the understanding of the relationship between post fire soil and vegetation recovery and the evolution of hydrologic shifts onda et al 2008 kinoshita and hogue 2011 further research remains necessary at the catchment scale woodsmith et al 2004 to relate the hydrologic anomalies to remotely sensed imagery using paired basin approaches innovations are particularly germane for application to ungauged basins post fire hydrologic shifts beyond the plot and hillslope scale were studied by several authors lane et al 2006 mayor et al 2007 heath et al 2014 wine and cadol 2016 bart and hope 2010 bart 2016 however catchment scale studies are less frequently found than plot or hillslope scale investigations and consequently streamflow dynamics at the watershed scale are less clearly understood under post fire conditions moody and martin 2001a mayor et al 2007 furthermore there is a paucity of post fire studies with hydrological records available both pre and post fire woodsmith et al 2004 kinoshita and hogue 2015 making it difficult to quantify streamflow shifts relative to unburned conditions this study investigates catchment scale hydrological shifts relative to unburned conditions at a predominantly forested catchment in colorado usa the broader research questions are 1 what are the potential links between basin average nbr and the observed post fire streamflow anomalies and 2 how could paired basin δnbr be used to quantify inter annual runoff alterations and hydrologic recovery post fire the focus of the study is on the use of remote sensing data to detect and track a basin s hydrologic response to wildfire impacts and to investigate the links with streamflow shifts through process based analyses pre and post fire catchment observations of precipitation streamflow and satellite derived nbr are used δnbr is computed from simultaneous burned and unburned paired catchments with the purpose of excluding the effects of vegetation phenology to infer changes due to the fire impacts that result in runoff generation shifts to account for the effects of severe weather within this mountain watershed analyses are conducted under warm season precipitation as measured by rain gauges situated within and nearby the catchment six years pre and post fire are analyzed as a representative period for precipitation and streamflow in regards to vegetation recovery while also ensuring a representative number of storm events to synthesize hydrologic patterns the objectives of this study are to 1 evaluate the utility of nbr in estimating transient shifts in runoff fraction peak streamflow and time to peak streamflow and 2 examine the coupled ecosystem hydrologic response post fire from the event to the inter annual scale by combining ground stations and remote sensing image analysis the focus will be on the camp creek catchment located within waldo canyon in colorado table 1 summarizes previous research and reports that have investigated the hydrological and societal impacts of the 2012 waldo canyon fire in colorado a unique and widely studied fire which also serves as a case study in the current paper 2 study area hydrology and remote sensing data 2 1 wildfire coverage and study area between june 23rd and july 10th of 2012 the waldo canyon fire burned over 74 km2 of land near colorado springs co the wildfire extent general area topography and vegetation distribution are shown in fig 1 and appendix a 1 the proximity of the fire to a large city colorado springs fig 1 enhanced the human impact of the waldo canyon fire damaging 346 homes and killing two people city of colorado springs 2013 the u s forest service s inter agency burn area emergency response baer team classified 28 of the burn area as very low severity 23 as low 29 as moderate and 20 high severity see fig a 1 camp creek is a 24 4 km2 catchment with 78 of its drainage area affected by this fire see fig 1 table 2 summarizes wildfire spatiotemporal characteristics within camp creek indicating burned area and wildfire period according to the baer team camp creek had 36 of the burn area as low severity 37 moderate severity and 5 high severity young and rust 2012 rosgen et al 2013 a neighboring unburned control catchment with similar topographic channel network and land cover characteristics is stanley creek this is a 9 km2 watershed located within 8 7 km distance from camp creek that was used as a control catchment for comparing unburned to burned i e camp creek nbr values see fig 1 table 3 documents geomorphic and land cover characteristics of the two burned and unburned catchments table 3 and fig 1 indicate that both camp and stanley creeks hold similar relief channel network distribution mean slope general aspect and vegetation cover additionally given the short distance that separates them they share similar climates such similarities result in similar spectral signatures of the nbr see section 4 1 the seasonality of precipitation in colorado s central mountains is complex with intense precipitation possible all year however during the warm season april to october the precipitation is likely to be convective and even under unburned conditions it can trigger instantaneous flood risk that is enhanced by the steep slopes of this region mahoney et al 2015 moreno et al 2012 2013 2 2 observed precipitation and streamflow data this study uses multi year data from three precipitation gauges and one streamflow gauge spanning the warm season april through october without snow events in the analysis of pre and post fire hydrologic patterns to emphasize rainfall driven responses fig 1 shows the regional location of the study gauge stations while table 4 illustrates station codes type measurement frequency and missing data and table 2 specifies the evaluation periods according to the data availability camp creek s main stream is ephemeral with zero flow values outside of active precipitation events it has 15 minute streamflow and 5 minute precipitation data available through the united states geological survey usgs national water information system and national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa cooperative observer program coop 2 3 remote sensing data this study uses mod13q1 modis imagery to calculate the nbr and quantify fire induced changes within the burned camp creek relative to the unburned stanley creek catchment while evi and ndvi are based on near infrared and visible light to quantify vegetation s density and health nbr enhances the distinction between burned and unburned surfaces with the addition of the mid infrared spectral band the mod13q1 modis provides imagery for calculating 16 day composites of nbr data at 250 m resolution and is available from february 2000 present nasa lp daac 2000 3 methods 3 1 evolution of catchment burn severity and streamflow pre and post fire nbr values were calculated from the near infrared nir and mid infrared mir modis bands roy et al 2006 for both camp and stanley creeks the phenologic cycles in the spectral signal of vegetation prevent the use of a single reference pre fire nbr image for camp creek to estimate nbr changes with respect to standard conditions instead comparing simultaneous nbr composites at paired camp creek and stanley creek catchments helps in isolating the effects of fire on vegetation from natural variability therefore a nbr time series analysis was conducted to determine if both i e burned and unburned catchment s spectral signal mean and variability preserved a high correlation coefficient during pre fire conditions lhermitte et al 2010 veraverbeke et al 2010 diaz delgado and pons 2001 veraverbeke et al 2010 further regression analysis was applied e g logarithmic exponential linear power law and polynomial to best fit the first two distributional moments during the 2006 through 2012 period the best predictor was used to adjust nbr values at stanley to camp creek pre fire and to forecast post fire nbr at camp creek as if it was unburned catchment average and standard deviation nbr values associated with the burned and unburned conditions were computed throughout the april october season over the evaluation period excluding any periods with observed snow on the ground in a typical year and for clear sky conditions a maximum of 14 average nbr composites 2 per month over the 7 month season were available δnbr was then computed as the difference between adjusted unburned and burned conditions at camp creek as illustrated by equation 1 diaz delgado and pons 2001 1 δ nbr t nbr unburned t nbr burned t where t is the simultaneous period for which the difference is calculated all terms represent catchment average values nbrunburned and nbrburned correspond to the adjusted nbr from stanley creek and the simultaneous values at camp creek respectively although this difference i e δnbr only makes sense post fire the calculation pre fire should yield values close to zero as a way to ensure that both adjusted and actual nbr values were very similar pre fire theoretically δnbr ranges from 2 negative two indicating healthier vegetation and 2 positive two for high severity burn with 0 zero meaning conditions similar to pre fire this methodology facilitated the tracking of post fire vegetation recovery relative to the unburned conditions under similar climatic conditions flow duration curves fdcs are widely used to study exceedance probabilities of mean and extreme hydrologic values in some cases they have also been used to evaluate the effects of catchment disturbances on flow distribution providing statistical information on streamflow variability lane et al 2005 lane et al 2006 kinoshita and hogue 2015 fdcs were created for the pre and post fire study periods in camp creek using daily average streamflow data to identify fire related shifts in streamflow frequency distribution 3 2 cross scale temporal streamflow shifts the subsequent event scale analyses incorporated δnbr by using the average values associated with the closest in time 16 day composite of each month depending on the date of the streamflow event similarly the seasonal and inter annual scale analyses took the average of each year s 14 nbr composites to compute δnbr between the burned and unburned vegetation regarding the streamflow metrics event daily and seasonal scale values were computed to assess runoff changes post fire relative to pre fire conditions event scale calculations were conducted for a total of 76 hydrologic events 38 associated with pre fire and another 38 with post fire conditions table 2 summarizes the pre fire and post fire time spans all periods with snowfall or presence of snow on the ground were removed from the analyses to ensure that initial soil moisture conditions were low events with minimal precipitation p 3 mm five days prior were selected so that the hydrologic effects due to land cover change rather than high antecedent soil moisture could be isolated fig 2 illustrates a typical response hydrograph where q represents the total streamflow through the basin outlet as a result of both base flow qb and event flow q q represents the total water volume per unit catchment area as a result of the precipitation depth ptot a graphical base flow separation method was used to divide response hydrographs between qb and q fig 2 dingman 2015 at the monthly and seasonal scales q represents the total streamflow volume leaving the catchment through its outlet as a result of a monthly or seasonal precipitation input ptot calculations for the monthly and seasonal q and ptot are made for the months and seasons associated with each of the 78 maximum hydrologic events in camp creek based on those streamflow metrics four comparative streamflow response metrics were used a event effective runoff per unit precipitation q ptot mm mm b event peak streamflow qpk m3 s c event time to peak fraction of hydrograph base time tr tb min min and d monthly and seasonal runoff coefficient q ptot mm mm high values of q ptot and qpk represent high runoff yields and maximum flows small values of tr tb indicate a faster paced hydrograph rise whereas larger values are associated with a slower rise this cross scale analysis facilitated the assessment of acute and chronic post fire anomalies in runoff production per unit drainage area and precipitation depth so that runoff changes could be mostly attributed to vegetation alterations produced within the burn scars 3 3 streamflow shifts and burn severity links in order to explore the co dependence of q ptot qpk and tr tb with event precipitation properties such as precipitation total ptot average and maximum intensity iave and imax and land cover change due to burn severity i e δnbr a variance contribution approach was applied including the76 study events first scatterplots and correlation coefficients between pairs of imax ptot and iavg were calculated to assess their level of independence prior to the application of the variance contribution analysis then q ptot qpk and tr tb were plotted against δnbr with regards to their ptot imax and iavg to investigate the potential links among groups of three variables e g q ptot δnbr and ptot empirical density distributions were plotted and kolmogorov smirnov tests were conducted in regards to the pre and post fire distributions subsequently a variance contribution analysis was conducted for variable arrays containing each of the event streamflow properties q ptot qpk and tr tb and all other independent variables including precipitation characteristics and δnbr imax ptot iavg and δnbr the method includes all measured predictors into multiple linear combinations to find a subset that explains the highest percent of the variance in the predictands best subsets heinze et al 2018 olejnik et al 2000 is a technique that relies on exhaustive searches for the best groups of the variables using an efficient branch and bound algorithm the procedure fits 2p i e 16 models where p 4 is the number of predictors in the dataset the akaike information criterion aic akaike 1973 and the coefficient of determination r2 facilitate model selection by providing an estimator of the relative quality of statistical models for a given set of data results are presented in pie charts model regression plots and tables for pre and post fire events finally inter annual q ptot were analyzed relative to simultaneous δnbr values to identify recovery patterns of vegetation properties and their potential controls on runoff production at camp creek 4 results 4 1 evolution of catchment burn severity and streamflow pre and post fire a sequence of nbr field values from may 2012 pre fire month and august 2012 post fire month and their corresponding nbrmay nbraug difference illustrates the effects that fire had on vegetation in the waldo canyon region see fig 3 in fig 3 a and 3 b nbr values range between 1 and 1 pre and post fire with an evident shift to negative values post fire indicating removal of vegetation by fire the nbrmay nbraug difference illustrates changes of up to 2 nbr units in the most severely burned areas of camp creek the pre fire average basin values of nbr i e nbrmay for camp creek and stanley creek are 0 24 and 0 29 respectively for post fire conditions the average nbraug for camp creek is 0 03 while the unburned value for stanley is 0 36 nbr regression analysis found that either linear logarithmic or polynomial models provided the same coefficient of determination r2 0 80 between simultaneous catchment average values at camp and stanley creeks during the 2006 through 2012 pre fire period see table b 1 a linear model was then selected to express nbr at camp creek as a function of the values at stanley creek as shown by figs b 1 and b 2 this results in synthetic time series of nbr at camp creek as if it was unburned thereby facilitating the comparison of burned and unburned conditions for post fire events within camp creek time series of daily total precipitation p bi weekly mean and standard deviation nbr and daily average streamflow q over camp creek catchment are shown in fig 4 during the 12 year evaluation period for reference stanley creek s adjusted mean nbr time series have also been added to fig 4 seasonally nbr peaks in late july and early august of each year the waldo canyon wildfire abruptly decreases the post fire camp creek s catchment average nbr and increases its spatial variability as reflected by the larger standard deviation bars however after fire nbr follows a recovery pathway gradually increasing each year further nbr s spatial variability appears to decrease faster returning to pre fire values in about three years after the wildfire event in camp creek the pre fire i e 2006 2012 and post fire i e 2012 2018 mean seasonal precipitation values were 357 and 416 mm respectively this difference can be explained by the exceptionally dry year of 2012 year of the wildfire with a precipitation total of 256 mm and the exceptionally wet year of 2015 with 663 mm of precipitation in general camp creek showed lower streamflow responses to precipitation events pre fire fig 4 changes in discharge are evident post fire the magnitude of streamflow events increased significantly post fire with the largest pre fire qpk over the 2006 2012 period being 0 26 m3 s while the largest post fire qpk of 10 42 m3 s occurred in may of 2015 almost three years after the fire equivalent to at least an order of magnitude increase with respect to the maximum qpk which occurred during the pre fire period similar peak streamflow events occurred the same year and month after the wildfire in july of 2012 8 64 m3 s and one year later in august of 2013 6 54 m3 s warm season flow duration curves fdcs are created from daily average streamflow data for the pre and post fire study periods and indicate changes in camp creek s flow regime post fire fig 5 fdcs over a 20 year pre fire time period 1992 2012 are used as the baseline to quantify fire impacts pre and post fire fdcs are not distributed over the entire range of exceedance probabilities because camp creek is an ephemeral stream the rightward shift of the post fire fdc indicates that all portions of the flow regime are affected by burn scars and the streamflow at each probability value is on average an order of magnitude larger across the range of probabilities high flows flows at 1 exceedance probability smakhtin 2001 increase from 0 74 m3 s pre fire to 2 5 m3 s post fire low flows flows 99 exceedance probability brown et al 2005 do not increase in magnitude remaining at 0 m3 s post fire however the shift in streamflow distribution post fire indicates that the number of zero flow days slightly decreased throughout the 20 years prior to the wildfire zero flow days occurred 88 9 of the time and over the 6 year post fire time span this value decreased to 85 7 for a difference of 3 2 reduction in zero flow days 4 2 cross scale temporal streamflow shifts this section synthetizes the observed wildfire induced streamflow shifts from the event to seasonal time scales fig 6 illustrates the pre and post fire q ptot for 76 hydrologic events 38 pre and 38 post fire and their associated daily and monthly average q ptot symbols are colored by their corresponding total precipitation ptot mm a summary of the mean absolute and relative changes between pre and post fire values at each temporal scale is shown in table 5 fig 6 and table 5 indicate increases in effective runoff per unit precipitation from the event to the monthly time scales nonetheless the largest difference in runoff between pre and post fire is observed at the event scale with two orders of magnitude i e 102 higher values than pre fire see table 5 increases in streamflow magnitudes occur across a wide range of precipitation totals 4 3 streamflow shift links with burn severity this section illustrates the differing hydrologic response patterns between pre and post fire conditions for individual precipitation events at camp creek and the role of burn severity on the observed acute event and chronic inter annual streamflow shifts fig 7 provides an example case of the corresponding response hydrographs for two such events that are similar in ptot and iavg fig 7 b illustrates a post fire storm event with a ptot of 27 6 mm and iavg of 6 12 mm hr that produced a qpk of 8 64 m3 s and a q ptot of 0 85 these values i e qpk and q ptot are at least one and two orders of magnitude respectively larger than the pre fire values shown in fig 7 a the total precipitation five days prior to each event is 1 2 mm pre fire and 3 1 mm post fire indicating that the antecedent soil moisture between the two events is similar the nature and properties of precipitation play a definitive role on the magnitude and pace of the response hydrograph and this is the reason why the following results are illustrated in terms of imax iavg and ptot to expand on the analysis of q ptot qpk and tr tb for the pre and post fire study events fig 8 illustrates their relationships with δnbr and classifies according to precipitation properties i e ptot imax iavg for the 76 pre and post fire storm events to help understand average pre and post fire behaviors table 6 further synthetizes event based mean absolute and relative hydrograph shifts from fig 8 and table 6 it can be inferred that at the event scale and for a wide range of ptot imax and iavg values increases in two orders of magnitude i e 102 on q ptot are observed post fire relative to pre fire conditions similarly increases of one order of magnitude i e 101 on qpk occur on average across a large spectrum of ptot imax and iavg additionally tr tb only shows a reduction of 10 relative to pre fire conditions illustrating a slight decrease on the average time to peak relative to pre fire conditions besides δnbr ptot and iavg appear to contribute to the variability of all three streamflow metrics i e q ptot qpk and tr tb often regulating i e enhancing or reducing the effect of δnbr for instance for a moderate precipitation event e g moderate ptot or iavg under a high δnbr high q ptot qpk and low tr tb tend to occur however a similar situation will occur under moderate δnbr in the presence of high ptot and iavg both scenarios result in an increase of streamflow values a further look to the probability density functions fig 9 and kolmogorov smirnov k s tests table 7 illustrate that precipitation properties e g ptot imax iavg do not appear to change significantly from pre to post fire except for a possible reduction in average intensity iavg fig 9 and table 7 post fire contrastingly δnbr distributions and k s test illustrate an evident right ward increasing shift post fire fig 9 d and table 7 the density functions of post fire q ptot and qpk are also right shifted relative to pre fire fig 9 e f and table 7 the shifts in the distribution of tr tb cannot be clearly identified fig 9 g table 7 precipitation characteristics i e ptot imax iavg do not seem to be strongly correlated as shown by fig c 1 the variance contribution results shown in fig 10 and further detailed in fig d 1 and table d 1 help quantify the relationships between burn severity precipitation properties and hydrologic response both pre and post fire for the pre fire events precipitation related predictors contribute in 98 ptot and iavg 73 ptot and iavg and 100 ptot and imax to the total variability that is possible to explain of each predictand q ptot qpk and tr tb see table d 1 when the four predictors are included within the best possible linear model combinations contrastingly for the post fire condition and except for tr tb δnbr displaces all precipitation properties as the main driver of hydrologic response contributing 82 and 79 to the explained variability of q ptot and qpk respectively consistent to previous results tr tb remains mostly controlled by ptot at the inter annual scale burn scars undergo a recovery process with vegetation re growth eventually leading to canopy densities similar to pre fire conditions in the absence of species replacement or succession and as this process occurs a hysteresis effect on the values of q ptot is observed fig 11 illustrates this process through seasonal average q ptot plotted against the corresponding seasonal average δnbr throughout the inter annual catchment s evaluation period fig 11 shows that the pre fire years 2007 through 2011 present low values with δnbr ranging between 0 015 and 0 015 and relatively low q ptot values except by 2007 and 2010 between 2011 and the 2012 fire year an increase in δnbr from 0 015 in 2011 to 0 26 in 2012 is associated with an increase in q ptot from 0 0003 to 0 02 in 2012 with this period being one of the driest in terms of low seasonal precipitation i e 122 mm the 2013 2017 seasonal sequence indicates a trend toward decreasing δnbr values although runoff efficiencies remain higher than many of the pre fire years shown 5 discussion 5 1 evaluating post fire hydrologic response shifts through nbr previous studies have described post fire anomalies and their relation to remotely sensed indices moody et al 2008 kinoshita and hogue 2011 benyon and lane 2013 moody et al 2015 for example moody et al 2008 2015 linked pre and post fire δnbr to short term soil hydraulic alterations and anomalies in peak streamflows post fire kinoshita and hogue 2011 evaluated the annual evolution in runoff production of a burned watershed in california but using time series of the evi in an effort to quantify vegetation recovery jin et al 2012 used multi year times series of nbr to evaluate changes in forest albedo the results presented in this manuscript represent the first effort to systematically evaluate the utility of nbr to reveal transient hydrologic catchment responses observed at multiple temporal scales i e from event to inter annual for up to six years of vegetation regrowth in this study catchment scale hydrologic response to fire was evaluated for a large sample i e 76 of precipitation events and seasonal totals that were similar to pre fire values in an ephemeral mountainous forested catchment a six year pre fire time period provided a comparison timeframe to evaluate the shifts in hydrologic response at the watershed scale regarding the first research question results showed that a drop in the catchment average satellite derived normalized burned ratio nbr is accompanied by an increase in the amount of effective runoff contributing to larger magnitude streamflow responses in volume and peak flow rate suggesting a degree of coupling between burn severity and hydrologic response additionally flow frequencies showed a consistent shift toward a larger range of exceedance probabilities post fire also indicating a slight decrease in the number of zero flow days with respect to the 20 years of record previous to the wildfire date in 2012 previous studies had observed this effect from single events or a smaller sample of events stoof et al 2012 verdin et al 2012 young and rust 2012 rosgen et al 2013 the influence of burn severity on vegetation propagates from the minute to the inter annual time scales indicating that the mechanisms of runoff generation endure for a significant period of time post fire regardless of the precipitation characteristics the associated increases in volume and flow rates are suggestive of enhanced infiltration excess overland flow mayor et al 2007 three particular events in april and may of 2010 show large runoff efficiencies similar to post fire events we hypothesize these could be due to a prolonged snow melt period extending from late april to early may out of the three evaluation metrics i e q ptot qpk and tr tb q ptot was the most significantly affected for all precipitation events post fire this means that the efficiency of runoff volume production is significantly enhanced regardless of the precipitation total from the storm to the seasonal scales this result is similar to previous studies investigating fire impacts on stream hydrology kinoshita and hogue 2015 also noted elevated streamflow during low flow seasons for up to 10 years post fire producing a newly perennial system however the increase in peak streamflow shown in camp creek s post fire was not observed in lane et al 2006 or kinoshita and hogue 2015 the reasons both studies provide for this is the rapid breakdown or altogether absence of fire induced soil hydrophobicity on the other hand although cydzik and hogue 2009 found significant reductions in basin lag time for six large to moderate post fire runoff events attributing the change to reduced infiltration associated with loss of vegetation and increased imperviousness the present study did not find significant changes in the time to peak flow relative to the total time base of the hydrographs one reason for this could be the ephemeral condition of camp creek added to the relative small size of the catchment as compared to larger watersheds studied by cydzik and hogue in answering the second science question related to the utility of δnbr to quantify inter annual runoff alterations and hydrologic recovery post fire the development of a variance contribution analysis provided further element tools to link satellite derived burned severity to the observed shifts in hydrologic response for the case of this single wildfire event no direct mathematical relations were found to exactly predict the magnitude of expected change for particular combinations of δnbr ptot imax or iavg nonetheless the cross scale analyses conducted outlined that observed event scale shifts in watershed stream response characteristics are found to shape longer term runoff ratios post wildfire further post fire vegetation recovery is a key determinant in the evolution of runoff as noted by wittenberg et al 2007 casady et al 2009 and kinoshita and hogue 2011 that conducted their analyses through time series of δevi we selected paired basin δnbr as it removes the effects of phenology and enhances the distinction between burned and unburned surfaces with the addition of the mid infrared spectral band as δnbr decreased several months after the wildfire occurred seasonal average runoff began recovering toward pre fire values following a hysteresis pattern see fig 11 with the burn severity but also precipitation depth as exemplified by the exceptionally wet year of 2015 very strong positive enso phases like the one in 2015 enhance the effect of fire severity through significant increases in q ptot of up to at least one order of magnitude relative to runoff fractions during post fire years the waldo canyon fire was a rather severe wildfire judging by the long recovery time relative to normal year hydrologic e g non enso 2008 2009 2010 pre fire conditions we argue that this hysteresis effect rules post fire hydrologic responses as measured by q ptot and possibly also qpk the time and magnitude of such an effect depends on the severity of the burn and vegetation species pre and post fire while a clear mathematical or statistical relationship between the δnbr q ptot and qpk was not found the balance of evidence shows correlation between hydrologic response properties and δnbr the lack of identifying a clear relation can be attributed to the highly complex watershed response processes and their feedbacks that rule post fire runoff responses additional factors include antecedent soil moisture conditions and snow processes but also differences in soil hydraulic properties determined by the short term presence of an ash layer woods and balfour 2010 ebel et al 2012 as noted by previous authors post fire event runoff generating processes and magnitudes are dynamic shakesby and doerr 2006 larson et al 2009 and therefore cannot likely be captured by a single vegetation metric although the results presented herein are based on a single basin s response the study underlines the potential use of paired basin δnbr for process understanding and predicting acute and chronic anomalies in vegetation and runoff and their linked recovery after a wildfire event along with precipitation characteristics and antecedent soil moisture conditions nbr is useful in determining mean expected shifts in effective runoff and peak streamflow from the event to the inter annual time scales nbr can also be used to reveal the vegetation recovery pathway that restores hydrologic conditions i e hysteresis curve demonstrating its usability to track the evolution of the annual runoff anomalies relative to pre fire conditions despite no straightforward relations being found between precipitation characteristics antecedent soil moisture and burn severity the findings of this study are of utility to hyper resolution process based modelers including the newly developed national water model gochis et al 2018 that account for time evolving vegetation and land cover status linking satellite derived indices to such hydrologic response metrics could also result in improvements of the rainfall runoff hydrograph calculation methods e g u s natural resources conservation service scs method and or unit and synthetic hydrographs after a wildfire event in an operational context land managers and decision makers could rely on the usability of nbr and δnbr to better monitor understand and estimate both event and long term responses of burned watersheds particularly those that are ungauged 6 study scope and limitations results provide consistent evidence of the exacerbated post fire runoff responses and their occurrence from the hourly to the inter annual time scales however inherent uncertainties arise when taking a lumped approach to vegetation dynamics for example within burn heterogeneity might play a role in enhancing or inhibiting water flow connectivity after fire a distributed approach could help shed light on the post fire vegetation dynamics of each sub catchment which might not be well captured by the catchment average δnbr additionally uncertainties are likely to influence results when three point based rain gauges are applied to analyze catchment scale streamflow dynamics spatially distributed bias corrected radar based precipitation data is preferred when quantifying catchment scale streamflow dynamics because it provides an estimation of rainfall spatial variability with respect to the burned areas further the present study did not explicitly consider the effects of the fire severity on the soil hydraulic properties as directly measured from the terrain these results underscore the importance of in situ soil measurements and field validated data for storm scale hydrologic projections 7 conclusions acute short term and chronic long term 6 years post fire transient streamflow shifts caused by wildfires are evaluated for a forested mountain catchment under warm season precipitation along with the quantified shifts the utility of the remotely sensed normalized burn ratio nbr is explored and quantified from the event to inter annual scales to study the transient post fire changes in streamflow results can be summarized as 1 observed reductions in nbr due to wildfire are concurrent with increases in runoff production i e q ptot under similar event precipitation depths intensities and antecedent soil moisture conditions 2 daily average flow duration curves show increases of an order of magnitude in the maximum streamflow values for the same exceedance probability events 3 increases in effective runoff q ptot and runoff fraction q ptot are observed at the event daily monthly and seasonal scales for similar precipitation totals pre and post fire the largest absolute increase in runoff production is observed at the event scale q ptot increases in two orders of magnitude in average indicating a significant shift in flash flood probability post fire 4 of the three response hydrograph metrics q ptot and qpk were the ones that illustrated the largest positive changes this indicates that regardless of the precipitation type or intensity enhanced runoff generation mechanisms were able to transform available precipitation into quick flow resulting in taller wider response hydrographs the response time was not necessarily identified as a critical shift variable in this catchment meaning that travel and residence times may not necessarily be affected by wildfires on ephemeral catchments of this type 5 density distributions and k s tests showed significant positive shifts for δnbr q ptot and qpk post fire despite ptot iavg imax showed average decreases from a set of storm events analyzed post fire 6 a variance contribution analysis further supports the strong dependence of hydrologic responses on precipitation properties pre fire but δnbr was a primary contributor on post fire hydrologic response 7 a hysteresis effect was found at the inter annual scale between the seasonal runoff fraction i e q ptot δnbr and ptot that illustrates the strong controls of soil and vegetation conditions on the corresponding runoff production at multiple temporal scales post fire for this particular case 6 years of vegetation re growth and soil hydraulic recovery post fire are not enough time to return to pre fire hydrologic conditions as the runoff mechanisms enhanced by the wildfire are still producing larger streamflow values comparable to pre fire years with exceptional rainfall or snow seasons 8 in summary paired basin δnbr was found to be of high utility for hydrologic analyses as it indicated vegetation status through its temporal correlation with the efficiency of runoff generation this finding supports the hypothesis that the remotely sensed δnbr could potentially be used to gain process understanding and improve predictions in burned basins as they are susceptible to yielding much greater runoff ratios than what is expected during pre fire conditions δnbr can also be used to monitor the basin s vegetation and hydrologic response recovery and improve transient modeling of the effects of vegetation status on hillslope and channel runoff future work could focus on conducting physically based distributed hydrologic observations and modeling to disaggregate the spatio temporal variability of runoff generating mechanisms that are responsible for the shifts observed across the temporal scales illustrated in this
