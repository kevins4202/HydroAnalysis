groundwater quality due to the difficulty in measuring the underground leakage of soil water the amount of nutrient loss leakage on a karst slope is currently unknown a karst slope farmland is simulated in a laboratory based on field investigations in slope farmlands in a karst plateau region in guizhou province china rainfall experiments were conducted to determine the surface losses and underground leakages of soil water nitrogen phosphorus and potassium as well as the effects of rainfall intensity and slope on these factors in karst slope farmlands surface runoff occurs only at rainfall intensities greater than 30 mm h but underground runoff occurs under all rainfall intensity conditions moreover underground leakage loss is the main mode of water loss soil loss on a karst slope farmland is a process that transitions from underground leakage to surface erosion as the rainfall intensity increases the concentrations of total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp and total potassium tk in surface runoff increase with increasing rainfall intensity and decrease with increasing slope gradient the total loss loads of tn and tk in runoff and sediment increase with increasing rainfall intensity or slope gradient the total nutrient loss loads of tn and tp are dominated by runoff losses but the tk loss load is dominated by sediment losses keywords soil erosion underground

however the mechanisms of soil loss especially underground losses in this region are not clear nitrogen phosphorus and potassium are the three major nutrients for crops and the three elements that determine soil fertility in a karst ecosystem plants with a developed root system not only absorb water and nutrients from the soil layer but the system also extends to absorb and use the moisture and nutrients in underground fissures therefore it is necessary to reveal the characteristics of soil nutrient losses in karst areas especially in the case of underground leakage therefore taking a barre karst slope as an example this paper represents an initial effort to study the surface and underground leakage losses of soil water and nutrients from an integrated soil bedrock fissure system perspective a simulated rainfall test was conducted to measure the surface loss and underground leakage loss of soil water and nutrients at the plot scale the goal of this study was to 1 determine the surface losses and underground leakage of soil water nitrogen phosphorus and potassium and 2 the effect of rainfall intensity and slope on these losses as well as 3 the role of underground leakage in soil water and nutrient loss from a rock mantled slope in the karst rocky desertification area these results are of significance for controlling karst rocky desertification and help to better understand the processes of surface loss and underground leakage of soil water and pollution sources in the karst rocky desertification area 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental materials test soils were collected from a typical karst slope farmland fig 1 located in qingyan town huaxi district guiyang city of guizhou province china qingyan town is famous as an historical and cultural ancient town in guizhou province this area has a mid subtropical humid monsoon climate the rock stratum in this area is limestone sand shale etc and outcrops are mostly carbonate limestone the regional soil is yellow soil calcareous soil paddy soil etc the test soils are calcareous soils classified as calcisols in the fao taxonomy the test soil was not screened but large soil masses were dispersed for simulated rainfall tests the soil particle size distribution was as follows 18 33 clay less than 0 001 mm 43 33 silt 0 001 0 05 mm and 38 33 sand 0 05 1 00 mm rainfall experiments were conducted in guizhou university guiyang city china the experimental equipment consisted of a rainfall simulator and a steel tank the experimental equipment was similar to that described by dai et al 2017a b and peng et al 2017 2 2 experimental design the experiments were designed table 1 based on field investigations and literature analysis of rainfall intensity slope gradient bedrock bareness rate and underground pore fissure i slope the five levels of the experimental slope gradient were set as 5 10 15 20 and 25 ii rainfall intensity the experimental rainfall intensities were 15 30 50 70 and 90 mm h based on the characteristics of erosive rainfall in the karst area of guizhou province iii bedrock bareness rate the bedrock bareness rate is the ratio of the bedrock outcrop area to the projected horizontal area of the slope the bedrock bareness rate was set to 10 representing the wide distribution of cultivated land in the karst area of guizhou province which was simulated by randomly arranging limestone rocks amounting to 9 pieces of limestone rocks with irregular shapes and diameters greater than 35 cm in the steel test tank iv underground pore fissure the underground pore fissure degree is the ratio of the underground pore fissures to the floor area of the steel tank this value was set at 5 it is simulated using drainage holes at the bottom of the steel tank to measure the amount of soil water that can enter the underground pore fissures during a rainfall event v the soil layers were divided into three sublayers with a total depth of 30 cm the soil bulk density was 1 4 1 1 and 1 0 g cm3 for the lower sublayer middle sublayer and upper sublayer respectively each rainfall event was repeated three times after each rainfall event the soil in the steel tank was replaced with fresh soil before the next rainfall event 2 3 simulated rainfall test the procedures for the karst slope simulation and simulated rainfall tests were similar to those described by dai et al 2017a b and peng et al 2017 the rainfall duration was 30 min for each rainfall event surface sediment runoff and underground sediment runoff were collected at the surface and the bottom of the steel tank respectively 2 4 nutrient measurements runoff volumes were measured using large metered plastic buckets the sediment yield was determined by the oven drying method sediment samples were dried in a forced air oven to constant weight at 105 c and weighed after the runoff samples were collected they were preserved with acid h2so4 and analysed indoors after 24 h the total phosphorus tp was measured by the mo sb colorimetric method total potassium tk was measured by atomic absorption and total nitrogen tn was measured by the kjeldahl method institute of soil science chinese academy of sciences 1978 lu 1999 3 results 3 1 runoff and sediment leakage loss under different rainfall intensities and slopes 3 1 1 runoff loss runoff is a driving force that carries sediment and contributes to nutrient loss analysing the effect of rainfall intensity and slope on runoff yield would be helpful to understand the mechanisms of soil nutrient loss in sloped farmland fig 2 shows the surface and underground runoff depth yielded from karst slope farmland under different rainfall intensities and slope gradients the total runoff depth is dominated by underground runoff and the underground runoff coefficient varies from 0 36 to 0 86 in other words underground leakage loss is the main form of water loss on a karst slope farmland and leakage loss is weakened with increased rainfall intensity rainfall intensity has a substantial effect on runoff yield including surface underground and total runoff which always increases with increasing rainfall intensity fig 2 as shown in fig 2 surface runoff does not occur under low rainfall intensity conditions 15 and 30 mm h while surface runoff is generated at a rainfall intensity of 50 mm h there is a critical rainfall intensity for producing surface runoff on a karst slope farmland that fluctuates between 30 and 50 mm h however underground runoff always occurs under all rainfall intensity conditions the slope condition influences the distribution of surface and underground runoff table 2 a higher slope gradient is a disadvantage to the production of total and underground runoff with the increase of the slope gradient both the total runoff depth and the underground runoff depth decrease under the same rainfall intensity conditions nevertheless the increase in the slope gradient is an advantage for the yield of surface runoff the higher the slope gradient is the greater the surface runoff from karst slope farmland 3 1 2 soil loss fig 3 presents the surface and underground leakage losses under different rainfall intensities and slope gradients as shown only underground leakage loss occurs under low rainfall intensity conditions 15 and 30 mm h and soil erosion on karst slope farmland only exists via underground leakage loss under these conditions at a rainfall intensity of 50 mm h the total soil loss is dominated by underground leakage loss and under these conditions the soil erosion on the karst slope farmland includes surface erosion and underground leakage loss except for the 5 slope condition where surface erosion does not occur at greater rainfall intensities 70 and 90 mm h the proportion of underground leakage loss to total soil loss decreases except for the 5 and 10 slope conditions where soil erosion on the karst slope farmland is dominated by surface erosion this variation shows that soil erosion on a karst slope farmland is a process of transition from underground leakage to surface erosion that occurs with an increase in rainfall intensity rainfall intensity has a clear influence on the amount of surface and total soil loss both of which increase with an increase in rainfall intensity rainfall intensity also has some effect on underground leakage loss which first increases and then decreases with increasing rainfall intensity under the same slope conditions the underground leakage loss of soil is maximal at a rainfall intensity of 50 mm h which is the critical rainfall intensity for soil underground leakage loss the slope gradient affects the production of surface sediment to a certain extent the greater the slope gradient is the more conducive the conditions are for surface erosion moreover with an increase in slope gradient the proportion of surface loss to total soil loss increases under low slope conditions 5 surface loss does not occur except for under rainfall intensities of 90 mm h the underground leakage loss presents a trend that first increases and then decreases with increasing slope gradient and underground leakage loss is maximal at a slope gradient of 15 3 2 nutrient output processes in runoff and sediment under different rainfall intensities and slopes fig 4 demonstrates the process of transporting nutrients in runoff under different rainfall intensities as a whole the concentrations of total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp and total potassium tk in surface and underground runoff present a certain degree of fluctuation during the rainfall erosion process at the beginning of the rainfall duration 0 20 min the concentrations of nutrients are not at their peak values that is there are no initial scouring effects the concentration of tn in runoff is always greater than the concentrations of tp and tk under the same conditions and concentrations of those nutrients in surface runoff are maximal at the greatest rainfall intensity 90 mm h compared with tn and tp the concentration of tk in surface runoff fig 4a is obviously higher than that in the underground runoff fig 4b this is because less of the potassium is lost to the underground through infiltration fig 5 shows the nutrient concentration dynamics in surface and underground runoff under different slope gradients the nutrient concentrations in the runoff under different slope gradients also indicate a trend of fluctuation throughout the rainfall process specifically the concentration of each nutrient in the surface runoff is maximal under the 5 slope gradient condition the average concentration of each nutrient in runoff and sediment during the rainfall erosion process is presented in table 3 as shown the concentrations of tn tp and tk in surface runoff increase with increasing rainfall intensity except in the case of no surface runoff however there are no obvious relationships between the rainfall intensity and the concentration of nutrients in underground runoff surface sediment or underground sediment for the slope condition the concentration of each nutrient in the surface runoff decreases with increasing slope gradient except in the case of no surface runoff the nutrient concentrations in underground runoff surface sediment and underground sediment have no obvious relationship with the slope gradient 3 3 nutrient leakage loss under different rainfall intensities and slopes fig 6 indicates the variation of nutrient loss in runoff under different rainfall intensities visibly the nutrient loss in surface runoff fluctuates little during the process of rainfall erosion however it increases with increasing rainfall intensity fig 6a this is because the greater the rainfall intensity is the stronger the erosive effects of raindrops on the surface soil and the more nutrients dissolve in the soil compared with surface runoff the nutrient loss in underground runoff shows more fluctuation during the rainfall erosion process fig 6b fig 7 shows the variation in soil nutrient loss in runoff under different slope gradients fluctuations are also present in the nutrient loss in both the surface and underground runoff in particular the tk tp and tn losses from surface runoff are lower than those from underground runoff the nutrient loss load during individual rain events is an important indicator in the study of soil nutrient loss and provides important guiding significance for preventing and controlling soil nutrient loss on karst slope farmland table 4 and table 5 present the nutrient loss loads carried by surface and underground runoff and sediment table 4 shows that both rainfall intensity and slope gradient overwhelmingly influence the nutrient loss loads in surface runoff the loss loads of tn tp and tk in surface runoff increase with either increasing rainfall intensity or slope gradient however there is an uncertain relationship between rainfall intensity slope gradient and nutrient loss load in underground runoff and total runoff in addition the ratios of underground runoff to total runoff loss loads of tn tp and tk are all greater than 52 7 except for tk and tp under rainfall intensities of 90 mm h in other words underground runoff is the main contributor to nutrient loss in runoff on karst slope farmland as shown in table 5 the loss loads of tp and tn in the surface sediment become aggravated with increasing rainfall intensity at the same time the trend is similar to the total loss load of tk and tn in both runoff and sediment in addition the steeper the slope is the greater the total loss loads of tk and tn in runoff and sediment loss or leakage because of the influence of soil adsorption there is no law regarding the loss load of tp in the sediment the two factors have no obvious effects on the nutrient loss loads in underground sediment and the sum of runoff and sediment for rainfall intensity the nutrient loss loads in the surface sediment are lower than in the underground sediment at rainfall intensities lower than 50 mm h but the opposite holds true at rainfall intensities higher than 70 mm h the total nutrient loss loads of tn and tp are dominated by runoff losses and the ratio of runoff to total nutrient loss load is greater than 70 2 however the total load of tk loss is dominated by sediment losses on karst slope farmland and the ratio of sediment to total nutrient loss loads is higher than 60 0 except for the case of 15 mm h rainfall intensity 4 discussions 4 1 influence of rainfall intensity on soil water and nutrient leakage losses rainfall is a driving force for soil solute transport and the carrier and solvent of nutrient output ramos and martinezcasasnovas 2006 the soil nutrients such as nitrogen phosphorus and potassium that are carried away by surface and underground runoff not only cause a decline in soil fertility but also lead to groundwater pollution in karst areas peng et al 2017 rainfall intensity plays a role in soil solute transport via runoff and sediment guo et al 2010 which not only inputs energy to the entire soil water system but also inputs water hence analysing the effects of rainfall intensity on soil nutrients in a karst slope farmland is a key to reveal the mechanisms of soil nutrient loss our results in fig 2 indicate that the critical rainfall intensity for generating surface runoff changed between 30 mm h and 50 mm h but underground runoff is always produced under all rainfall intensity conditions this agrees well with the results from wei et al who monitored slope farmland in a karst valley area that is surface runoff was produced under only heavy rain conditions 25 50 mm especially rainstorm conditions greater than 50 mm in this area wei et al 2016 the results of observations in large runoff fields chen et al 2012 also have shown that there were very small amounts of surface soil water loss on karst slopes and the event surface runoff coefficients were less than 5 on hillslopes with different land uses this is because most of the rain enters the subterranean river system through karst fissures pipelines and ponors in our study the total soil loss was dominated by underground leakage loss under low rainfall intensity but it was dominated by surface loss at higher rainfall intensity fig 3 these results agree well with the results of 137cs isotope tracing on a slope in a karst valley area wei et al 2016 however yang et al 2011 used field monitoring to conclude that loss leakage of soil through the underground channel is the major form of soil and water loss in the karst rocky desertification area inessence controlling the formation and development of soil water underground drain passages such as fissures pipelines and ponors is the key to reducing soil water and nutrient losses in this area relevant studies have shown that the nutrient concentrations in surface runoff fluctuate during rainfall erosion processes and there are obvious initial scouring effects under different rainfall intensities ramos and martinezcasasnovas 2006 meng et al 2008 figs 4 and 5 indicate that the concentrations of tn tp and tk in the surface and underground runoff fluctuated to some extent but there were no obvious initial scouring effects this may be because some nutrients in soils cannot be fully dissolved with smaller runoff volumes at the beginning of a rain event as a decisive factor for soil water loss rainfall intensity has a power function relation with the amount of nitrogen loss from surface runoff idowu et al 2010 the amounts of phosphorus and potassium that were lost also increased with the increase in rainfall intensity meng et al 2008 our results have shown that the loss loads of tn and tp in both surface runoff and sediment increased with the increase in rainfall intensity but the loss loads in underground runoff and sediment could not be determined by rainfall intensity the reason lies in the fact that rainfall intensity has a direct influence on the surface soil while it has a weak influence on the deep soil and the formation of underground runoff and sediment is only related to soil infiltration and the flow at the rock soil interface 4 2 effect of slope gradient on soil water and nutrient leakage losses as a key topographic factor the slope gradient is often considered to control nutrient contaminant or particle transfer and is commonly used to predict and assess soil losses at different scales kateb et al 2013 zhang et al 2003 slope gradient not only changes the characteristics of overland flow but also alters the angle of contact between raindrops and the soil that means that the balance between water and material changes which inevitably affects the distribution of soil water loss between the surface and underground areas in karst regions previous studies in non karst areas have shown that the greater the slope gradient is the higher the potential for surface runoff and soil loss kateb et al 2013 assouline and ben hur 2006 found that with increased slope gradient the cumulative surface runoff after 70 mm of rainfall decreased while soil loss increased at the same time some studies have examined the relationship between surface soil loss and slope gradient and these studies observed a critical threshold of the slope gradient wu et al 2012 our study also demonstrated that the slope gradient influences the distribution of surface and underground runoff however different from a non karst area the results in fig 2 and fig 3 indicate that the surface runoff yield is positively correlated with slope gradient but the underground runoff is negatively correlated with slope gradient in addition both the surface and underground sediment yields presented no obvious patterns the results indicated that a steep slope is prone to surface erosion while a gentle slope is prone to underground leakage therefore it is important to explore a moderate slope gradient where surface erosion and underground leakage are not serious the slope gradient affects runoff and soil loss during rainfall erosion processes fang et al 2015 the slope gradient may influence soil nutrient losses through runoff flux and soil loss from slope farmland however few studies have reported the effects of the slope gradient on nutrient loss in runoff and sediment nutrient concentration outputs are mainly determined by the soil properties and the interaction between soil and rainfall runoff li and wang 2016 this may be responsible for the small difference in nutrient concentrations in runoff under different slope gradients fig 5 table 4 indicates that slope gradient produced an obvious effect on the nutrient loss loads in surface runoff and the tk and tn loss loads in surface sediments that is as the slope gradient increased both the nutrient loss loads in the surface runoff and the tk and tn loss loads in the surface sediment increased however that pattern was not present in the underground runoff and sediment this result indicated that slope gradient had little effect on nutrient mass losses in underground runoff and sediment 5 conclusions the role of underground leakage in soil water and nutrient loss were studied on slope farmland on a karst plateau at the plot scale through simulated rainfall tests surface runoff only occurs at rainfall intensities greater than 30 mm h but underground runoff occurs under all rainfall intensity conditions underground leakage loss is the main pathway of water loss and leakage loss is weakened with increasing rainfall intensity slope conditions influence the distribution of surface and underground runoff soil loss on karst slope farmland is a process that transitions from underground leakage to surface erosion with the increase in rainfall intensity rainfall intensity influences the amounts of surface and total soil loss which increase with the increase in rainfall intensity the slope gradient also affects the production of surface sediment to a certain extent the nutrient concentrations in the runoff indicate a fluctuating trend during the erosion process the concentration of tk in the surface runoff is obviously higher than that in the underground runoff compared with tn and tp the concentrations of tn tp and tk in the surface runoff increase with increasing rainfall intensity and decrease with increasing slope gradient the loss load of tn and tk in the sum of runoff and sediment is more aggravated with an increase in rainfall intensity or slope gradient total loss loads of tn and tp are dominated by runoff losses but the tk loss load is dominated by sediment losses underground runoff is the primary contributor to nutrient loss in runoff on karst slope farmland therefore both the generation of underground runoff and the formation of surface erosion should be controlled in the process of controlling soil and water loss and

in fig 2 surface runoff does not occur under low rainfall intensity conditions 15 and 30 mm h while surface runoff is generated at a rainfall intensity of 50 mm h there is a critical rainfall intensity for producing surface runoff on a karst slope farmland that fluctuates between 30 and 50 mm h however underground runoff always occurs under all rainfall intensity conditions the slope condition influences the distribution of surface and underground runoff table 2 a higher slope gradient is a disadvantage to the production of total and underground runoff with the increase of the slope gradient both the total runoff depth and the underground runoff depth decrease under the same rainfall intensity conditions nevertheless the increase in the slope gradient is an advantage for the yield of surface runoff the higher the slope gradient is the greater the surface runoff from karst slope farmland 3 1 2 soil loss fig 3 presents the surface and underground leakage losses under different rainfall intensities and slope gradients as shown only underground leakage loss occurs under low rainfall intensity conditions 15 and 30 mm h and soil erosion on karst slope farmland only exists via underground leakage loss under these conditions at a rainfall intensity of 50 mm h the total soil loss is dominated by underground leakage loss and under these conditions the soil erosion on the karst slope farmland includes surface erosion and underground leakage loss except for the 5 slope condition where surface erosion does not occur at greater rainfall intensities 70 and 90 mm h the proportion of underground leakage loss to total soil loss decreases except for the 5 and 10 slope conditions where soil erosion on the karst slope farmland is dominated by surface erosion this variation shows that soil erosion on a karst slope farmland is a process of transition from underground leakage to surface erosion that occurs with an increase in rainfall intensity rainfall intensity has a clear influence on the amount of surface and total soil loss both of which increase with an increase in rainfall intensity rainfall intensity also has some effect on underground leakage loss which first increases and then decreases with increasing rainfall intensity under the same slope conditions the underground leakage loss of soil is maximal at a rainfall intensity of 50 mm h which is the critical rainfall intensity for soil underground leakage loss the slope gradient affects the production of surface sediment to a certain extent the greater the slope gradient is the more conducive the conditions are for surface erosion moreover with an increase in slope gradient the proportion of surface loss to total soil loss increases under low slope conditions 5 surface loss does not occur except for under rainfall intensities of 90 mm h the underground leakage loss presents a trend that first increases and then decreases with increasing slope gradient and underground leakage loss is maximal at a slope gradient of 15 3 2 nutrient output processes in runoff and sediment under different rainfall intensities and slopes fig 4 demonstrates the process of transporting nutrients in runoff under different rainfall intensities as a whole the concentrations of total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp and total potassium tk in surface and underground runoff present a certain degree of fluctuation during the rainfall erosion process at the beginning of the rainfall duration 0 20 min the concentrations of nutrients are not at their peak values that is there are no initial scouring effects the concentration of tn in runoff is always greater than the concentrations of tp and tk under the same conditions and concentrations of those nutrients in surface runoff are maximal at the greatest rainfall intensity 90 mm h compared with tn and tp the concentration of tk in surface runoff fig 4a is obviously higher than that in the underground runoff fig 4b this is because less of the potassium is lost to the underground through infiltration fig 5 shows the nutrient concentration dynamics in surface and underground runoff under different slope gradients the nutrient concentrations in the runoff under different slope gradients also indicate a trend of fluctuation throughout the rainfall process specifically the concentration of each nutrient in the surface runoff is maximal under the 5 slope gradient condition the average concentration of each nutrient in runoff and sediment during the rainfall erosion process is presented in table 3 as shown the concentrations of tn tp and tk in surface runoff increase with increasing rainfall intensity except in the case of no surface runoff however there are no obvious relationships between the rainfall intensity and the concentration of nutrients in underground runoff surface sediment or underground sediment for the slope condition the concentration of each nutrient in the surface runoff decreases with increasing slope gradient except in the case of no surface runoff the nutrient concentrations in underground runoff surface sediment and underground sediment have no obvious relationship with the slope gradient 3 3 nutrient leakage loss under different rainfall intensities and slopes fig 6 indicates the variation of nutrient loss in runoff under different rainfall intensities visibly the nutrient loss in surface runoff fluctuates little during the process of rainfall erosion however it increases with increasing rainfall intensity fig 6a this is because the greater the rainfall intensity is the stronger the erosive effects of raindrops on the surface soil and the more nutrients dissolve in the soil compared with surface runoff the nutrient loss in underground runoff shows more fluctuation during the rainfall erosion process fig 6b fig 7 shows the variation in soil nutrient loss in runoff under different slope gradients fluctuations are also present in the nutrient loss in both the surface and underground runoff in particular the tk tp and tn losses from surface runoff are lower than those from underground runoff the nutrient loss load during individual rain events is an important indicator in the study of soil nutrient loss and provides important guiding significance for preventing and controlling soil nutrient loss on karst slope farmland table 4 and table 5 present the nutrient loss loads carried by surface and underground runoff and sediment table 4 shows that both rainfall intensity and slope gradient overwhelmingly influence the nutrient loss loads in surface runoff the loss loads of tn tp and tk in surface runoff increase with either increasing rainfall intensity or slope gradient however there is an uncertain relationship between rainfall intensity slope gradient and nutrient loss load in underground runoff and total runoff in addition the ratios of underground runoff to total runoff loss loads of tn tp and tk are all greater than 52 7 except for tk and tp under rainfall intensities of 90 mm h in other words underground runoff is the main contributor to nutrient loss in runoff on karst slope farmland as shown in table 5 the loss loads of tp and tn in the surface sediment become aggravated with increasing rainfall intensity at the same time the trend is similar to the total loss load of tk and tn in both runoff and sediment in addition the steeper the slope is the greater the total loss loads of tk and tn in runoff and sediment loss or leakage because of the influence of soil adsorption there is no law regarding the loss load of tp in the sediment the two factors have no obvious effects on the nutrient loss loads in underground sediment and the sum of runoff and sediment for rainfall intensity the nutrient loss loads in the surface sediment are lower than in the underground sediment at rainfall intensities lower than 50 mm h but the opposite holds true at rainfall intensities higher than 70 mm h the total nutrient loss loads of tn and tp are dominated by runoff losses and the ratio of runoff to total nutrient loss load is greater than 70 2 however the total load of tk loss is dominated by sediment losses on karst slope farmland and the ratio of sediment to total nutrient loss loads is higher than 60 0 except for the case of 15 mm h rainfall intensity 4 discussions 4 1 influence of rainfall intensity on soil water and nutrient leakage losses rainfall is a driving force for soil solute transport and the carrier and solvent of nutrient output ramos and martinezcasasnovas 2006 the soil nutrients such as nitrogen phosphorus and potassium that are carried away by surface and underground runoff not only cause a decline in soil fertility but also lead to groundwater pollution in karst areas peng et al 2017 rainfall intensity plays a role in soil solute transport via runoff and sediment guo et al 2010 which not only inputs energy to the entire soil water system but also inputs water hence analysing the effects of rainfall intensity on soil nutrients in a karst slope farmland is a key to reveal the mechanisms of soil nutrient loss our results in fig 2 indicate that the critical rainfall intensity for generating surface runoff changed between 30 mm h and 50 mm h but underground runoff is always produced under all rainfall intensity conditions this agrees well with the results from wei et al who monitored slope farmland in a karst valley area that is surface runoff was produced under only heavy rain conditions 25 50 mm especially rainstorm conditions greater than 50 mm in this area wei et al 2016 the results of observations in large runoff fields chen et al 2012 also have shown that there were very small amounts of surface soil water loss on karst slopes and the event surface runoff coefficients were less than 5 on hillslopes with different land uses this is because most of the rain enters the subterranean river system through karst fissures pipelines and ponors in our study the total soil loss was dominated by underground leakage loss under low rainfall intensity but it was dominated by surface loss at higher rainfall intensity fig 3 these results agree well with the results of 137cs isotope tracing on a slope in a karst valley area wei et al 2016 however yang et al 2011 used field monitoring to conclude that loss leakage of soil through the underground channel is the major form of soil and water loss in the karst rocky desertification area inessence controlling the formation and development of soil water underground drain passages such as fissures pipelines and ponors is the key to reducing soil water and nutrient losses in this area relevant studies have shown that the nutrient concentrations in surface runoff fluctuate during rainfall erosion processes and there are obvious initial scouring effects under different rainfall intensities ramos and martinezcasasnovas 2006 meng et al 2008 figs 4 and 5 indicate that the concentrations of tn tp and tk in the surface and underground runoff fluctuated to some extent but there were no obvious initial scouring effects this may be because some nutrients in soils cannot be fully dissolved with smaller runoff volumes at the beginning of a rain event as a decisive factor for soil water loss rainfall intensity has a power function relation with the amount of nitrogen loss from surface runoff idowu et al 2010 the amounts of phosphorus and potassium that were lost also increased with the increase in rainfall intensity meng et al 2008 our results have shown that the loss loads of tn and tp in both surface runoff and sediment increased with the increase in rainfall intensity but the loss loads in underground runoff and sediment could not be determined by rainfall intensity the reason lies in the fact that rainfall intensity has a direct influence on the surface soil while it has a weak influence on the deep soil and the formation of underground runoff and sediment is only related to soil infiltration and the flow at the rock soil interface 4 2 effect of slope gradient on soil water and nutrient leakage losses as a key topographic factor the slope gradient is often considered to control nutrient contaminant or particle transfer and is commonly used to predict and assess soil losses at different scales kateb et al 2013 zhang et al 2003 slope gradient not only changes the characteristics of overland flow but also alters the angle of contact between raindrops and the soil that means that the balance between water and material changes which inevitably affects the distribution of soil water loss between the surface and underground areas in karst regions previous studies in non karst areas have shown that the greater the slope gradient is the higher the potential for surface runoff and soil loss kateb et al 2013 assouline and ben hur 2006 found that with increased slope gradient the cumulative surface runoff after 70 mm of rainfall decreased while soil loss increased at the same time some studies have examined the relationship between surface soil loss and slope gradient and these studies observed a critical threshold of the slope gradient wu et al 2012 our study also demonstrated that the slope gradient influences the distribution of surface and underground runoff however different from a non karst area the results in fig 2 and fig 3 indicate that the surface runoff yield is positively correlated with slope gradient but the underground runoff is negatively correlated with slope gradient in addition both the surface and underground sediment yields presented no obvious patterns the results indicated that a steep slope is prone to surface erosion while a gentle slope is prone to underground leakage therefore it is important to explore a moderate slope gradient where surface erosion and underground leakage are not serious the slope gradient affects runoff and soil loss during rainfall erosion processes fang et al 2015 the slope gradient may influence soil nutrient losses through runoff flux and soil loss from slope farmland however few studies have reported the effects of the slope gradient on nutrient loss in runoff and sediment nutrient concentration outputs are mainly determined by the soil properties and the interaction between soil and rainfall runoff li and wang 2016 this may be responsible for the small difference in nutrient concentrations in runoff under different slope gradients fig 5 table 4 indicates that slope gradient produced an obvious effect on the nutrient loss loads in surface runoff and the tk and tn loss loads in surface sediments that is as the slope gradient increased both the nutrient loss loads in the surface runoff and the tk and tn loss loads in the surface sediment increased however that pattern was not present in the underground runoff and sediment this result indicated that slope gradient had little effect on nutrient mass losses in underground runoff and sediment 5 conclusions the role of underground leakage in soil water and nutrient loss were studied on slope farmland on a karst plateau at the plot scale through simulated rainfall tests surface runoff only occurs at rainfall intensities greater than 30 mm h but underground runoff occurs under all rainfall intensity conditions underground leakage loss is the main pathway of water loss and leakage loss is weakened with increasing rainfall intensity slope conditions influence the distribution of surface and underground runoff soil loss on karst slope farmland is a process that transitions from underground leakage to surface erosion with the increase in rainfall intensity rainfall intensity influences the amounts of surface and total soil loss which increase with the increase in rainfall intensity the slope gradient also affects the production of surface sediment to a certain extent the nutrient concentrations in the runoff indicate a fluctuating trend during the erosion process the concentration of tk in the surface runoff is obviously higher than that in the underground runoff compared with tn and tp the concentrations of tn tp and tk in the surface runoff increase with increasing rainfall intensity and decrease with increasing slope gradient the loss load of tn and tk in the sum of runoff and sediment is more aggravated with an increase in rainfall intensity or slope gradient total loss loads of tn and tp are dominated by runoff losses but the tk loss load is dominated by sediment losses underground runoff is the primary contributor to nutrient loss in runoff on karst slope farmland therefore both the generation of underground runoff and the formation of surface erosion should be controlled in the process of controlling soil and water loss and

6156,although global warming decreases winter snow storage and snow melt peak discharges in the majority of basins in warm regions there exist specific catchments in cold regions where climate change increases the risk of snow melt floods in winters and earlier than usual springs the volume of water contained in a snowpack is quantified by snow water equivalent the near real time estimation of which is essential to issue early warnings against snow melt floods we propose a new approach for rapid and high resolution estimation of snow water equivalent for small mountainous basins employing unmanned aerial vehicles known as drones numerical maps of snow water equivalent are automatically produced for subareas of a river basin by combining drone based snow depth maps with snow density estimates the reconstructions for subareas are extrapolated to the entire river basin using a zonal version of multiple linear regression validation is conducted on the example of the kwisa river in southwestern poland by balancing drone based snow water equivalent with snow melt runoff separated using a hydrologic model from discharges continuously measured during a thawing period differences between the drone based and reconstructed snow melt runoff are found to be of 11 2 1 6 and 18 9 providing evidence for the considerable worth skills of the new drone based flood risk assessment method keywords unmanned aerial vehicle snow depth snow water equivalent snow melt runoff spatial statistics the sudetes 1 introduction snow melt discharge is an important component of runoff with dissimilar contribution depending on hydrological regimes and other environmental factors for instance in glacierised catchments in norway approximately 60 of annual discharge is caused by snow melt episodes engelhardt et al 2014 while in contrast in the ganges basin snow melt events contribute up to 1 5 of the overall annual runoff siderius et al 2013 in a warming climate trends in snow melt driven peak discharges are expected to be increasing in cold regions and decreasing in warm areas with a particularly strong decrease in regimes where the dominant precipitation is prone to change from snow to rain wang et al 2016 which is usually associated with a decrease in winter snow storage romanowicz et al 2016 also the timing of snow melt driven runoff is shifted backward leading to earlier occurrences of peak discharges as presented for the alpine region coppola et al 2018 which confirms earlier projections offered by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2013 recent climate change predictions for the 21st century also anticipate the earlier occurrence of spring peak flows and the decrease in snow melt contribution to runoff due to reduced snow storage as recently exemplified for the alpine basin in switzerland etter et al 2017 climate driven changes in snow melt runoff have implications for the associated snow melt floods although most researchers agree that snow melt flood hazards decrease in regions with considerable snow accumulation due to shorter snow season less snow accumulation and earlier than usual snow melting there exist areas in which shorter snow cover persistence is compensated by higher winter precipitation and consequently peak discharges remain unchanged or tend to grow dankers and feyen 2009 this confirms that there is no clear picture of trends in climate driven snow melt peak discharges as postulated by wang et al 2016 and such a diversity of these trends contributes to spatially uneven and difficult to predict risk of snow melt floods under changing climate it is therefore necessary to develop new methods and technologies to warn citizens against snow melt floods and their consequences fang et al 2014 fang et al 2015 krøgli et al 2018 such early warning systems may be based on the basin scale estimation of spatial distribution of snow water equivalent swe which in mountainous terrain is currently the most important unsolved problem in snow hydrology dozier et al 2016 following the experimental studies on microwave properties of snow ellerbruch et al 1977 which at that time were perceived as a challenge to photographic remote snow observation rango 1978 since the late 1980 s swe has been estimated using microwave remote sensors and easy to invert empirical expressions chang et al 1987 over years the development in swe retrieval algorithms led to significant improvements in microwave snow characterization mainly due to the inversion of emission models pulliainen and hallikainen 2001 tedesco et al 2004 and data assimilation takala et al 2011 however current spatial resolution of space borne microwave radiometer data is of approximately 25 km metsämäki et al 2018 that may be enhanced to 3 125 km bair et al 2018 which constrains their use to characterize swe in small basins also the retrieval of swe from space observations remains elusive especially in mountain areas lettenmaier et al 2015 the small basin limitation can partially be reduced when adopting new close range remote sensing platforms such as unmanned aerial vehicles uavs and calculating swe as a product of uav based snow depth hs maps and snow density ρ estimates as postulated but not solved by dozier et al 2016 and miziński and niedzielski 2017 here we present the new method for estimating swe in small basins which uses uav photogrammetry and spatial statistics and we verify the research hypothesis that the uav based swe estimates can accurately approximate snow melt runoff 2 methods 2 1 from uav acquired images to snow melt runoff the approach proposed in this paper comprises 1 a group of methods for acquiring uav data and processing them in order to calculate swe within test sites 2 a group of methods for extrapolating swe from test sites to the entire basin the sketch of the entire procedure is presented in fig 1 2 1 1 acquisition and modelling of uav data in a few test sites i e small polygons 1 the area of so called small polygons is neither specified nor recommended in a general form in the experiment reported in this paper the percentage of the total area of all test sites in respect to the basin area is approximately equal to 1 6 1 coded as s1 sn located within a river basin or on its watershed uav flights should be carried out prior to a snow accumulation period during each of these flights aerial images of terrain should be acquired by a consumer grade camera visible light rgb or near infrared nir bands with frontal and side overlap minimum 75 and 60 respectively which is recommended in surveying practice to reconstruct sparse and dense point clouds using the structure from motion sfm method westoby et al 2012 such a sfm based dense point cloud should be well referenced to an earth fixed coordinate system with the accuracy of georeferencing ensured by the use of ground control points gcps or real time kinematic rtk satellite positioning subsequently the said sfm based dense point cloud is utilized to produce digital surface model dsm of a given test site the output is a set of up to date dsms without snow cover for all test sites known hereinafter as reference dsms alternatively one can use up to date lidar based snow free dense point clouds and dsms within test sites s1 sn the similar flights should be repeated over snow covered terrain at the time for which swe needs to be estimated as a spatial measure of water storage in snow for each site aerial photographs should be taken in the same fashion in order to run the sfm procedure and to reconstruct a dense point cloud and dsm of terrain with snow cover accumulated upon its surface in this step the output is a set of dsms with snow cover for all test sites known hereinafter as observation dsms the snow covered spatial data need to be well referenced and a relative fix to the reference dsm should be ensured for each test site this can be done either by using gcps and rtk or by aligning the observation dense point cloud to the reference one miziński and niedzielski 2017 for each test site reference and observation dsms should be superimposed on each other and the numerical snow depth hs map is produced as a difference between observation and reference dsms following the concept known as the dem digital elevation model of difference dod the procedure is well documented in the literature e g bühler et al 2016 adams et al 2018 and in the manuscript the approach by miziński and niedzielski 2017 is used the latter method produces hs maps using sfm and dod however georeferencing of the observation dense point cloud with snow to the reference dense point cloud without snow is carried out by using trees as stable reference objects namely having the two dense point clouds prepared trees are automatically detected and only they are used to match observation points to reference points this is done by employing a two stage procedure which consists of 1 initial low accuracy georeferencing using the helmert transformation and 2 final high accuracy registration using the iterative closest point icp algorithm miziński and niedzielski 2017 confirmed that reasonable results of hs reconstruction can be achieved using agisoft photoscan theia openmvs and runsfm the growth of vegetation and its wind and snow induced instability may cause erroneous offsets between dsms and therefore hs maps may be produced with a considerable uncertainty subsequently for each site a non spatial estimate of snow density ρ is calculated from up to date and historic meteorological data this may be achieved following otstavnov and gokhberg 1970 whose governing equation can be found in annex a methods for determination of the characteristic snow load on the ground of the iso 4355 1998 standard iso 4355 1998 and in the paper by meløysund et al 2007 i e 1 ρ 90 130 d 1 5 0 17 t 3 1 0 1 v where d is hs in metres t is average temperature in celsius degrees during the snow accumulation period v is average wind velocity in metres per second during the same period to produce numerical maps of swe for each test site numerical hs raster maps are multiplied by a site specific value of ρ the output is a set of numerical swe maps for all test sites 2 1 2 spatial models for snow water equivalent in order to reconstruct spatial distribution of swe in the entire river basin spatial extrapolation from test sites to the whole basin is recommended the zonal version of spatial regression is used to express swe as a function of numerous environmental variables excluding those which are co linear szymanowski and kryza 2017 the potential explanatory variables are terrain elevation slope inclination terrain roughness topographic position index solar radiation wind effects and distance to the nearest obstacles the variables may be computed from the lidar based digital terrain model dtm and dsm multiple linear regression models are fitted in a stepwise fashion szymanowski et al 2019 within 24 zones being combinations of distance from the closest obstacles 6 zones and terrain elevation 4 zones the non linear distribution of hs in the vicinity of obstacles is taken into account by dividing the area into 6 distance zones 0 1 1 2 2 5 5 10 10 20 and 20 m the boundaries of the elevation zones are determined in the following way firstly population of raster cells in each test site is split into two roughly equinumerous sets and elevation that splits the two sets is assumed to serve as a height threshold secondly n thresholds are determined based on n test sites and therefore n 1 elevation zones are produced in the manuscript n 3 and thus 4 zones i e 450 450 550 550 950 and 950 m are considered thirdly to avoid prospective discontinuity of modelled swe at the boundaries of height zones each of them is extended by 50 m in height the overlapping swe values are averaged the total volume of water stored in snow is calculated as a sum of swe raster cells within the entire basin 2 2 from radar based discharge time series to snow melt runoff discharge time series recorded at outlets g1 and g2 of the studied river basin characterize the total volume of water per time step over all seasons of a year the gauges g1 and g2 are equipped with the raven eye radar discharge meters for open channel measurements see fig 2 b of the manuscript that automatically acquire riverflow data with 12 min sampling interval the equipment uses the continuity equation in which discharge is calculated as a ratio between average flow velocity radar velocity measurement carried out every 12 min and the cross sectional area of river channel occupied by flow ultrasonic water level measurement carried out every 12 min combined with geodetic survey of river bed conducted before installation and every few months using the geo fennel optical level the real time discharge measurements have been checked four times between december 2015 and january 2018 by a fluvial geomorphologist who conduced detailed hydrometric measurements using the hega 1 flow meter the control data set has been used to check the correctness of the raven eye readings and to calculate a correction coefficient which removes underestimation of raven eye discharges that occurred after replacement of the equipment in g2 in the autumn 2016 the topography based hydrological model topmodel of beven and kirkby 1979 has been adopted to simulate discharge from precipitation and evapotranspiration time series to optimize parameters the standard monte carlo simulation has been replaced by the species based particle swarm optimization proposed by cho et al 2011 calibration and validation periods have been chosen in autumn 2017 without snow cover application period has intentionally been selected in winter 2017 to apply the calibrated topmodel in snowy conditions with snowfall treated as rainfall holko and lepistö 1997 such an application enables the simulation of a hypothetical winter discharge time series as if there had been no snow cover the difference between the measured total discharge time series radar based data and simulated hypothetical discharge time series data produced without snow subroutine approximates snow melt discharges and after integration over time approximates snow melt runoff when selecting the application period so that it spans the time interval between a uav flight see previous section and complete meltdown the above mentioned total runoff approximates the volume of water stored in snow cover 3 data the new method for estimating swe in small basins see methods and fig 1 has been tested on two mountainous catchments of the upper kwisa river fig 2a in the izerskie mountains the sudetes southwestern poland formed in crystalline rocks gneisses and granites the mountains experience considerable hs in winters which occasionally transforms to snow melt floods driven by mid winter foehn winds or regional spring warming events kasprzak and migoń 2015 long term decrease in snowiness is also reported for the mountains with a decrease in winter severity caused by climate warming urban et al 2018 the basins with areas of 23 5 km2 and 46 2 km2 denoted as b1 and b2 b1 is nested in b2 are delineated to drain mountainous terrain with outlets equipped with automatic discharge meters fig 2b the corresponding interbasin has area of 22 7 km2 and is denoted as b2 b1 the morphometric characteristics of these basins are juxtaposed in table 1 since 2015 regular flights of fixed wing uavs swinglet cam ebee and birdie supported by a mobile uav laboratory fig 2c equipped with rgb and nir consumer grade cameras have been carried out in four test sites to acquire aerial imagery of snow cover the most complete set of aerial photographs when snow cover persists in high altitude and inclined mountainous terrain as well as in low altitude and flat valley areas has been acquired using the ebee uav for three test sites coded as s1 s2 and s3 in fig 2c during fieldwork on 15 16 february 2017 from these dates onwards sun induced snow ablation occurred mainly at lower parts of the two basins and melting was intensified by a subsequent warm air advection these processes were slower at upper parts of b1 and b2 where snow cover remained stable until mid march and decreased gradually until its complete meltdown on 8 april 2017 detected by an ultrasonic snow sensor fig 2d the ebee uav has been equipped with canon powershot s110 rgb or nir versions provided together with the uav by its manufacturer sensefly the camera has focal length of 5 2 mm resolution of 12 megapixels and field of view of 73 3 the size of sensor is 1 1 7 7 44 5 58 mm the type of sensor is cmos and the processor is digic 5 the s110 rgb camera has maximum responses at 450 nm blue 520 nm green 660 nm red while the s110 nir sensor reaches maximum responses at 550 nm green 625 nm red 850 nm nir among many flights we selected three missions one per test site the flight plans are presented in fig 3 while flight characteristics are juxtaposed in table 2 during uav flights on 15 and 16 february 2017 weather remained stable the sky was cloudless wind speed was reported low and mean daily temperature was approximately equal to 0 c temperatures recorded over nights 14 15 and 15 16 february 2019 dropped significantly below 0 c which contributed to the stability of hs maximum daily temperature reached even 12 c but there was no corresponding decrease in snow cover this should be explained by the latent heat loss during intense sublimation of snow at a relative humidity of about 20 30 which led to the reduction of hs by only 2 cm the weather changed in the afternoon and evening on 16 february after the completion of uav missions 4 results 4 1 estimating snow water equivalent in small mountainous basins numerical hs maps generated with the spatial resolution of 1 1 m for the three test sites have been produced from aerial images of snow covered terrain using the automated method elaborated by miziński and niedzielski 2017 the resolution has been chosen to agree with the lidar based dtm and dsm used for building spatial models to estimate swe in the entire basin the hs raster values have been manually limited to omit outliers caused mainly by the instability of this method in the vicinity of trees fig 4 a c each of these rasters has been multiplied by a rough and site specific estimate of snow density see methods snow density for a given site s1 s2 or s3 has been calculated as a function of the uav based hs raster as well as air temperature and wind speed at an adjacent weather station amongst w7 w9 fig 2a e recorded over snow accumulation period herein the period between the beginning of snowing season adopted after urban 2015 and the date of uav flights the use of spatially constant snow densities which differ only between sites is explained by the fact that the spatial variability of snow density is much smaller than the spatial variability of hs lópez moreno et al 2013 for polana izerska s1 mean density was equal to 256 kg m 3 mean hs was of 0 72 m and mean swe was of 199 kg m 2 for drożyna s2 mean density was of 187 kg m 3 mean hs was equal to 0 16 m and mean swe was of 31 kg m 2 for krobica s3 mean density was found to be 184 kg m 3 mean hs was equal to 0 14 m and mean swe was of 30 kg m 2 the resulting numerical swe maps for the three test sites fig 4d f have been validated against swe data collected by meteorologists who sampled snow cover using the snow pit method during fieldwork fig 2c and fig 4d f the spatially sparse 1 or 2 points per site swe measurements have been compared with mean swe statistics computed on the basis of the uav based method in 10 metre buffer zones delineated around sampling points to account for the rough nature of the remote reconstructions measured vs reconstructed for the individual sites s1 312 vs 404 kg m 2 s2 55 59 kg m 2 vs no data 2 causes of missing data are explained by miziński and niedzielski 2017 2 s3 69 vs 61 kg m 2 the departures between the measured and reconstructed swe estimates may be driven by the limitations of the uav based approach miziński and niedzielski 2017 since the snow pit method for pointwise swe sampling is said to be accurate fassnacht et al 2010 for comparison published swe values recorded between february and mid march in a different year on the plateau of the izerskie mountains similar elevations to s1 are of 404 467 kg m 2 kępski et al 2016 and 300 750 kg m 2 figs 1 3 therein bercha et al 2008 to estimate swe in the entire two basins the zonal version of spatial regression has been used the multiple linear regression models fitted within 24 zones being combinations of terrain height 4 zones and distance from the closest obstacles 6 zones have been applied to extrapolate swe see methods the basin scale swe map fig 4g reflects the main patterns of snow accumulation in the izerskie mountains at this stage of snow cover development apart from elevation the most important factor controlling swe is slope aspect north and north eastern slopes are areas with deep snowpack which is particularly visible in concave landforms along the left tributaries of the kwisa river furthermore the influence of land cover mainly vegetation on the deposited snow is also noticeable slightly higher modelled swe values are present in forested areas rather than in meadows or in arable land snowiness is also greater in sparse forest or in treeless terrain along the ridge of wysoki grzbiet where trees are smaller than within steep north and north eastern slopes fig 4g the considerably lower swe values on the slopes of kamienicki grzbiet in comparison to areas located at similar altitudes within wysoki grzbiet are predominantly driven by more favourable insolation conditions slopes inclined towards the south and south west the total swe estimates integrated over basin area are approximately equal to 3 005 10 9 2 955 10 9 and 5 960 10 9 kg for b1 b2 b1 and b2 respectively table 1 since b1 is located closer to the headwaters where elevations are higher than in b2 b1 mean elevation 803 m a s l for b1 and 687 m a s l for b2 b1 it should be expected that b1 has higher swe than b2 b1 however when comparing b1 and b2 b1 in terms of morphometry table 1 there is a considerable difference in terrain aspect while the percentage of north facing slopes is similar in the two basins 35 1 and 38 9 for b1 and b2 b1 respectively the south facing slopes are more frequent in the higher basin b1 23 9 than in the lower interbasin b2 b1 13 8 the insolation effect reduces snow depth in b1 more intensively than in b2 b1 which given the fact that b1 has bigger mean altitudes than b2 b1 causes that the two basin have similar swe there is also another potential factor that may contribute to the rough equality of swe values in the two basins the equality in question may be strengthened by wind effects in the vicinity of mountain ridges in the studied area the prevailing winds are westerlies west facing slopes are more common in b1 26 5 than in b2 b1 18 7 which may lead to more effective reduction of snow depth in the higher basin than in the lower interbasin in addition this reasoning may be strengthened by the analysis of east facing slopes on which wind driven snow from ridges is naturally deposited such slopes are less frequent in b1 14 5 than in b2 b1 28 6 which means that the higher basin has less terrain for wind driven snow to be accumulated 4 2 balancing uav based snow water equivalent with snow melt runoff the concept of validating our new uav based method for retrieving total swe in a small basin is based on comparing swe estimates with snow melt runoff see methods and fig 5 a since 2015 we have collected discharge data at gauges g1 and g2 fig 2b above which the contributing basins are b1 and b2 the discharge data along with meteorological measurements recorded at weather stations fig 2e have been utilized to calibrate the topography based hydrological model topmodel beven and kirkby 1979 enhanced by the species based particle swarm optimization of model parameters cho et al 2011 the high flow events used for calibration occurred on 4 6 october 2016 g1 b1 and 24 29 september 2017 g2 b2 and snow free seasons have been selected to constrain the impact of snowfall treated as rainfall on discharge simulations the nash suttcliffe efficiency nse statistics for the calibration periods are equal to 0 93 and 0 97 for g1 b1 and g2 b2 respectively validation for two week periods after calibration shows the considerable agreement between simulated and measured discharges both for g1 b1 7 23 may 2017 nse 0 80 and g2 b2 7 20 october 2017 nse 0 82 the calibrated topmodel for g1 b1 and g2 b2 has been applied to simulate discharges in the period between uav flights 15 02 2017 and complete snow meltdown detected by the ultrasonic snow sensor 08 04 2017 fig 5d intentionally topmodel without a snow subroutine is used to simulate a possible hypothetical discharge which might have occurred in this period if there had been no snow cover similarly to holko and lepistö 1997 snowfall has been treated as rainfall while running topmodel conceptually measured discharges should be higher than simulated discharges since the simulated curve does not account for melting of snow we believe that the integral of the difference between the measured and simulated discharges over time 15 02 2017 08 04 2017 roughly approximates snow melt runoff which is found to be of about 3 383 10 9 and 5 869 10 9 litres for g1 b1 and g2 b2 respectively fig 5c d the noticeable magnitude of the difference is because melting of snow often controls a significant portion of the runoff in the mountainous terrain e g bair et al 2018 the uav based swe estimates see previous section and table 1 agree well with the approximate snow melt runoff calculations with 11 2 and 1 6 mismatches for the smaller and bigger catchments respectively however the error for the interbasin is equal to 18 9 while calculating the percentage mismatches the theoretical values are snow melt runoff estimates and experimental values correspond to the uav based swe approximations however both values are obtained with uncertainties the error sources of the swe computation are predominantly controlled by the uncertainties in the production the uav based hs maps the calculation of site specific snow densities the spatial statistical extrapolation of swe from test sites to the entire basin in contrast the errors of determining snow melt runoff are mainly driven by the uncertainties in the real time discharge measurements in open channel the mismodelling of discharges caused by processes other than melting of snow validation has also been performed by comparing the basin scale swe reconstruction with pointwise swe data acquired by meteorologists outside the test sites at a single location within the mountain pass of rozdroże izerskie located at 767 m a s l fig 2 the reconstructed equivalent computed as mean swe in the 10 metre buffer around the validation point 91 kg m 2 slightly overestimated measured data at the validation point using the snow pit method 77 kg m 2 5 discussion since snowmelt usually forms a major contribution to total runoff in the mountains the uav based swe estimates can be used to diagnose the magnitude of potential snow melt floods or may be assimilated in hydrologic models indeed blöschl et al 2016 claim that understanding the accumulation of snow and its meltdown may assist in more accurate flood forecasting and peak flow estimation not only the agreement between our swe estimates and the snow melt runoff but also the rapidness of such an on demand approach contributes to its usability when time matters before a potential flooding such a real time swe estimation remains a very recent problem which can be solved for medium sized basins with the use of satellite data bair et al 2018 unfortunately the enhanced resolution of the space borne passive microwave is not suitable to calculate swe in small river basins in real time e g in the studied basins of the upper kwisa river the entire catchment would be covered by a few enhanced 3 125 km 3 125 km grid cells omitting most of the local specificity of snow distribution in this context very important are the findings of krajčí et al 2016 who argue that spatial information on snowmelt is crucial for flood forecasting purposes even in mountainous microcatchments our real time and remotely sensed estimation of total swe and consequently snow melt runoff in small mountain basins accounts for spatial variability of snow and fills the gap between coarse satellite based assessment and labour intensive pointwise sampling of snow under changing climate snow melt floods in both large and small basins in central europe are said to be on the decrease ruiz villanueva et al 2016 also in the odra river basin to which the studied catchments belong mudelsee et al 2003 in the izerskie mountains this is controlled by negative trends in snowiness and winter severity urban et al 2018 our uav based experimental estimation of swe in the two example catchments is therefore impacted and constrained by smaller than usual hs according to recent studies bühler et al 2016 miziński and niedzielski 2017 adams et al 2018 hs fields are reconstructed using the structure from motion sfm algorithm from uav imagery with inaccuracies of a few tens of centimetres although this constraint shallow hs in a warmer climate vs decimetre hs determination error our hs and swe estimates roughly agree within test sites and also the basin scale swe values are well balanced with snow melt runoff as noted above even though it is widely confirmed that in most basins snow melt floods decrease along with global warming there exist some exceptions to this trend e g there are some northern rivers in which the 100 year return discharges remain stable or grow dankers and feyen 2009 in such catchments flood hazards increase with climate change and we believe that in such cases our approach might serve as one of the flood warning tools to mitigate potential negative consequences for humans the economy and the environment also it is known that in a warmer climate shallow snowpack melts earlier and slower than deep old snowpack leading to the reduction of meltwater released due to high melting rates musselman et al 2017 the increased rate of melting may increase flood hazards and our rapid method might help to monitor the risk in addition the ability of our approach to remotely estimate swe and snow melt runoff in a small mountainous catchment where under climate change snow melts in an accelerated fashion might also be used as a diagnostic factor that reduces summer soil moisture across mountain environments gergel et al 2017 6 conclusions here we show the new method for estimating swe in small river basins with high spatial resolution offered by observations of terrain carried out by uavs which provides swe estimates that agree well with snow melt runoff in a small mountainous basin the approach combines the uav based reconstruction of hs in a few test sites using the sfm algorithm with a simplistic snow density estimation to obtain swe in these sites later swe numerical maps for the test sites are utilized to extrapolate swe into the entire basin using spatial regression models the thorough verification and validation of the method is based on field data acquired during a long term experiment in the upper kwisa river basin in the izerskie mountains the sudetes poland the swe estimates are balanced with the reconstructed snow melt runoff the latter being calculated on the basis of topmodel and the radar based discharge time series we arrive at the conclusion that snow melt runoff can be estimated using the proposed uav based method with 11 2 and 1 6 errors for two basins under study which confirms the usefulness of our new approach for the interbasin the error reached 18 9 although it has several limitations described above quality of uav based hs reconstructions simplistic and non spatial estimation of snow density skills and robustness of spatial extrapolation it may serve as a near real time method for early warning against snow melt high flows in river basins impacted by flood risk description of authors

6156,although global warming decreases winter snow storage and snow melt peak discharges in the majority of basins in warm regions there exist specific catchments in cold regions where climate change increases the risk of snow melt floods in winters and earlier than usual springs the volume of water contained in a snowpack is quantified by snow water equivalent the near real time estimation of which is essential to issue early warnings against snow melt floods we propose a new approach for rapid and high resolution estimation of snow water equivalent for small mountainous basins employing unmanned aerial vehicles known as drones numerical maps of snow water equivalent are automatically produced for subareas of a river basin by combining drone based snow depth maps with snow density estimates the reconstructions for subareas are extrapolated to the entire river basin using a zonal version of multiple linear regression validation is conducted on the example of the kwisa river in southwestern poland by balancing drone based snow water equivalent with snow melt runoff separated using a hydrologic model from discharges continuously measured during a thawing period differences between the drone based and reconstructed snow melt runoff are found to be of 11 2 1 6 and 18 9 providing evidence for the considerable worth skills of the new drone based flood risk assessment method keywords unmanned aerial vehicle snow depth snow water equivalent snow melt runoff spatial statistics the sudetes 1 introduction snow melt discharge is an important component of runoff with dissimilar contribution depending on hydrological regimes and other environmental factors for instance in glacierised catchments in norway approximately 60 of annual discharge is caused by snow melt episodes engelhardt et al 2014 while in contrast in the ganges basin snow melt events contribute up to 1 5 of the overall annual runoff siderius et al 2013 in a warming climate trends in snow melt driven peak discharges are expected to be increasing in cold regions and decreasing in warm areas with a particularly strong decrease in regimes where the dominant precipitation is prone to change from snow to rain wang et al 2016 which is usually associated with a decrease in winter snow storage romanowicz et al 2016 also the timing of snow melt driven runoff is shifted backward leading to earlier occurrences of peak discharges as presented for the alpine region coppola et al 2018 which confirms earlier projections offered by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2013 recent climate change predictions for the 21st century also anticipate the earlier occurrence of spring peak flows and the decrease in snow melt contribution to runoff due to reduced snow storage as recently exemplified for the alpine basin in switzerland etter et al 2017 climate driven changes in snow melt runoff have implications for the associated snow melt floods although most researchers agree that snow melt flood hazards decrease in regions with considerable snow accumulation due to shorter snow season less snow accumulation and earlier than usual snow melting there exist areas in which shorter snow cover persistence is compensated by higher winter precipitation and consequently peak discharges remain unchanged or tend to grow dankers and feyen 2009 this confirms that there is no clear picture of trends in climate driven snow melt peak discharges as postulated by wang et al 2016 and such a diversity of these trends contributes to spatially uneven and difficult to predict risk of snow melt floods under changing climate it is therefore necessary to develop new methods and technologies to warn citizens against snow melt floods and their consequences fang et al 2014 fang et al 2015 krøgli et al 2018 such early warning systems may be based on the basin scale estimation of spatial distribution of snow water equivalent swe which in mountainous terrain is currently the most important unsolved problem in snow hydrology dozier et al 2016 following the experimental studies on microwave properties of snow ellerbruch et al 1977 which at that time were perceived as a challenge to photographic remote snow observation rango 1978 since the late 1980 s swe has been estimated using microwave remote sensors and easy to invert empirical expressions chang et al 1987 over years the development in swe retrieval algorithms led to significant improvements in microwave snow characterization mainly due to the inversion of emission models pulliainen and hallikainen 2001 tedesco et al 2004 and data assimilation takala et al 2011 however current spatial resolution of space borne microwave radiometer data is of approximately 25 km metsämäki et al 2018 that may be enhanced to 3 125 km bair et al 2018 which constrains their use to characterize swe in small basins also the retrieval of swe from space observations remains elusive especially in mountain areas lettenmaier et al 2015 the small basin limitation can partially be reduced when adopting new close range remote sensing platforms such as unmanned aerial vehicles uavs and calculating swe as a product of uav based snow depth hs maps and snow density ρ estimates as postulated but not solved by dozier et al 2016 and miziński and niedzielski 2017 here we present the new method for estimating swe in small basins which uses uav photogrammetry and spatial statistics and we verify the research hypothesis that the uav based swe estimates can accurately approximate snow melt runoff 2 methods 2 1 from uav acquired images to snow melt runoff the approach proposed in this paper comprises 1 a group of methods for acquiring uav data and processing them in order to calculate swe within test sites 2 a group of methods for extrapolating swe from test sites to the entire basin the sketch of the entire procedure is presented in fig 1 2 1 1 acquisition and modelling of uav data in a few test sites i e small polygons 1 the area of so called small polygons is neither specified nor recommended in a general form in the experiment reported in this paper the percentage of the total area of all test sites in respect to the basin area is approximately equal to 1 6 1 coded as s1 sn located within a river basin or on its watershed uav flights should be carried out prior to a snow accumulation period during each of these flights aerial images of terrain should be acquired by a consumer grade camera visible light rgb or near infrared nir bands with frontal and side overlap minimum 75 and 60 respectively which is recommended in surveying practice to reconstruct sparse and dense point clouds using the structure from motion sfm method westoby et al 2012 such a sfm based dense point cloud should be well referenced to an earth fixed coordinate system with the accuracy of georeferencing ensured by the use of ground control points gcps or real time kinematic rtk satellite positioning subsequently the said sfm based dense point cloud is utilized to produce digital surface model dsm of a given test site the output is a set of up to date dsms without snow cover for all test sites known hereinafter as reference dsms alternatively one can use up to date lidar based snow free dense point clouds and dsms within test sites s1 sn the similar flights should be repeated over snow covered terrain at the time for which swe needs to be estimated as a spatial measure of water storage in snow for each site aerial photographs should be taken in the same fashion in order to run the sfm procedure and to reconstruct a dense point cloud and dsm of terrain with snow cover accumulated upon its surface in this step the output is a set of dsms with snow cover for all test sites known hereinafter as observation dsms the snow covered spatial data need to be well referenced and a relative fix to the reference dsm should be ensured for each test site this can be done either by using gcps and rtk or by aligning the observation dense point cloud to the reference one miziński and niedzielski 2017 for each test site reference and observation dsms should be superimposed on each other and the numerical snow depth hs map is produced as a difference between observation and reference dsms following the concept known as the dem digital elevation model of difference dod the procedure is well documented in the literature e g bühler et al 2016 adams et al 2018 and in the manuscript the approach by miziński and niedzielski 2017 is used the latter method produces hs maps using sfm and dod however georeferencing of the observation dense point cloud with snow to the reference dense point cloud without snow is carried out by using trees as stable reference objects namely having the two dense point clouds prepared trees are automatically detected and only they are used to match observation points to reference points this is done by employing a two stage procedure which consists of 1 initial low accuracy georeferencing using the helmert transformation and 2 final high accuracy registration using the iterative closest point icp algorithm miziński and niedzielski 2017 confirmed that reasonable results of hs reconstruction can be achieved using agisoft photoscan theia openmvs and runsfm the growth of vegetation and its wind and snow induced instability may cause erroneous offsets between dsms and therefore hs maps may be produced with a considerable uncertainty subsequently for each site a non spatial estimate of snow density ρ is calculated from up to date and historic meteorological data this may be achieved following otstavnov and gokhberg 1970 whose governing equation can be found in annex a methods for determination of the characteristic snow load on the ground of the iso 4355 1998 standard iso 4355 1998 and in the paper by meløysund et al 2007 i e 1 ρ 90 130 d 1 5 0 17 t 3 1 0 1 v where d is hs in metres t is average temperature in celsius degrees during the snow accumulation period v is average wind velocity in metres per second during the same period to produce numerical maps of swe for each test site numerical hs raster maps are multiplied by a site specific value of ρ the output is a set of numerical swe maps for all test sites 2 1 2 spatial models for snow water equivalent in order to reconstruct spatial distribution of swe in the entire river basin spatial extrapolation from test sites to the whole basin is recommended the zonal version of spatial regression is used to express swe as a function of numerous environmental variables excluding those which are co linear szymanowski and kryza 2017 the potential explanatory variables are terrain elevation slope inclination terrain roughness topographic position index solar radiation wind effects and distance to the nearest obstacles the variables may be computed from the lidar based digital terrain model dtm and dsm multiple linear regression models are fitted in a stepwise fashion szymanowski et al 2019 within 24 zones being combinations of distance from the closest obstacles 6 zones and terrain elevation 4 zones the non linear distribution of hs in the vicinity of obstacles is taken into account by dividing the area into 6 distance zones 0 1 1 2 2 5 5 10 10 20 and 20 m the boundaries of the elevation zones are determined in the following way firstly population of raster cells in each test site is split into two roughly equinumerous sets and elevation that splits the two sets is assumed to serve as a height threshold secondly n thresholds are determined based on n test sites and therefore n 1 elevation zones are produced in the manuscript n 3 and thus 4 zones i e 450 450 550 550 950 and 950 m are considered thirdly to avoid prospective discontinuity of modelled swe at the boundaries of height zones each of them is extended by 50 m in height the overlapping swe values are averaged the total volume of water stored in snow is calculated as a sum of swe raster cells within the entire basin 2 2 from radar based discharge time series to snow melt runoff discharge time series recorded at outlets g1 and g2 of the studied river basin characterize the total volume of water per time step over all seasons of a year the gauges g1 and g2 are equipped with the raven eye radar discharge meters for open channel measurements see fig 2 b of the manuscript that automatically acquire riverflow data with 12 min sampling interval the equipment uses the continuity equation in which discharge is calculated as a ratio between average flow velocity radar velocity measurement carried out every 12 min and the cross sectional area of river channel occupied by flow ultrasonic water level measurement carried out every 12 min combined with geodetic survey of river bed conducted before installation and every few months using the geo fennel optical level the real time discharge measurements have been checked four times between december 2015 and january 2018 by a fluvial geomorphologist who conduced detailed hydrometric measurements using the hega 1 flow meter the control data set has been used to check the correctness of the raven eye readings and to calculate a correction coefficient which removes underestimation of raven eye discharges that occurred after replacement of the equipment in g2 in the autumn 2016 the topography based hydrological model topmodel of beven and kirkby 1979 has been adopted to simulate discharge from precipitation and evapotranspiration time series to optimize parameters the standard monte carlo simulation has been replaced by the species based particle swarm optimization proposed by cho et al 2011 calibration and validation periods have been chosen in autumn 2017 without snow cover application period has intentionally been selected in winter 2017 to apply the calibrated topmodel in snowy conditions with snowfall treated as rainfall holko and lepistö 1997 such an application enables the simulation of a hypothetical winter discharge time series as if there had been no snow cover the difference between the measured total discharge time series radar based data and simulated hypothetical discharge time series data produced without snow subroutine approximates snow melt discharges and after integration over time approximates snow melt runoff when selecting the application period so that it spans the time interval between a uav flight see previous section and complete meltdown the above mentioned total runoff approximates the volume of water stored in snow cover 3 data the new method for estimating swe in small basins see methods and fig 1 has been tested on two mountainous catchments of the upper kwisa river fig 2a in the izerskie mountains the sudetes southwestern poland formed in crystalline rocks gneisses and granites the mountains experience considerable hs in winters which occasionally transforms to snow melt floods driven by mid winter foehn winds or regional spring warming events kasprzak and migoń 2015 long term decrease in snowiness is also reported for the mountains with a decrease in winter severity caused by climate warming urban et al 2018 the basins with areas of 23 5 km2 and 46 2 km2 denoted as b1 and b2 b1 is nested in b2 are delineated to drain mountainous terrain with outlets equipped with automatic discharge meters fig 2b the corresponding interbasin has area of 22 7 km2 and is denoted as b2 b1 the morphometric characteristics of these basins are juxtaposed in table 1 since 2015 regular flights of fixed wing uavs swinglet cam ebee and birdie supported by a mobile uav laboratory fig 2c equipped with rgb and nir consumer grade cameras have been carried out in four test sites to acquire aerial imagery of snow cover the most complete set of aerial photographs when snow cover persists in high altitude and inclined mountainous terrain as well as in low altitude and flat valley areas has been acquired using the ebee uav for three test sites coded as s1 s2 and s3 in fig 2c during fieldwork on 15 16 february 2017 from these dates onwards sun induced snow ablation occurred mainly at lower parts of the two basins and melting was intensified by a subsequent warm air advection these processes were slower at upper parts of b1 and b2 where snow cover remained stable until mid march and decreased gradually until its complete meltdown on 8 april 2017 detected by an ultrasonic snow sensor fig 2d the ebee uav has been equipped with canon powershot s110 rgb or nir versions provided together with the uav by its manufacturer sensefly the camera has focal length of 5 2 mm resolution of 12 megapixels and field of view of 73 3 the size of sensor is 1 1 7 7 44 5 58 mm the type of sensor is cmos and the processor is digic 5 the s110 rgb camera has maximum responses at 450 nm blue 520 nm green 660 nm red while the s110 nir sensor reaches maximum responses at 550 nm green 625 nm red 850 nm nir among many flights we selected three missions one per test site the flight plans are presented in fig 3 while flight characteristics are juxtaposed in table 2 during uav flights on 15 and 16 february 2017 weather remained stable the sky was cloudless wind speed was reported low and mean daily temperature was approximately equal to 0 c temperatures recorded over nights 14 15 and 15 16 february 2019 dropped significantly below 0 c which contributed to the stability of hs maximum daily temperature reached even 12 c but there was no corresponding decrease in snow cover this should be explained by the latent heat loss during intense sublimation of snow at a relative humidity of about 20 30 which led to the reduction of hs by only 2 cm the weather changed in the afternoon and evening on 16 february after the completion of uav missions 4 results 4 1 estimating snow water equivalent in small mountainous basins numerical hs maps generated with the spatial resolution of 1 1 m for the three test sites have been produced from aerial images of snow covered terrain using the automated method elaborated by miziński and niedzielski 2017 the resolution has been chosen to agree with the lidar based dtm and dsm used for building spatial models to estimate swe in the entire basin the hs raster values have been manually limited to omit outliers caused mainly by the instability of this method in the vicinity of trees fig 4 a c each of these rasters has been multiplied by a rough and site specific estimate of snow density see methods snow density for a given site s1 s2 or s3 has been calculated as a function of the uav based hs raster as well as air temperature and wind speed at an adjacent weather station amongst w7 w9 fig 2a e recorded over snow accumulation period herein the period between the beginning of snowing season adopted after urban 2015 and the date of uav flights the use of spatially constant snow densities which differ only between sites is explained by the fact that the spatial variability of snow density is much smaller than the spatial variability of hs lópez moreno et al 2013 for polana izerska s1 mean density was equal to 256 kg m 3 mean hs was of 0 72 m and mean swe was of 199 kg m 2 for drożyna s2 mean density was of 187 kg m 3 mean hs was equal to 0 16 m and mean swe was of 31 kg m 2 for krobica s3 mean density was found to be 184 kg m 3 mean hs was equal to 0 14 m and mean swe was of 30 kg m 2 the resulting numerical swe maps for the three test sites fig 4d f have been validated against swe data collected by meteorologists who sampled snow cover using the snow pit method during fieldwork fig 2c and fig 4d f the spatially sparse 1 or 2 points per site swe measurements have been compared with mean swe statistics computed on the basis of the uav based method in 10 metre buffer zones delineated around sampling points to account for the rough nature of the remote reconstructions measured vs reconstructed for the individual sites s1 312 vs 404 kg m 2 s2 55 59 kg m 2 vs no data 2 causes of missing data are explained by miziński and niedzielski 2017 2 s3 69 vs 61 kg m 2 the departures between the measured and reconstructed swe estimates may be driven by the limitations of the uav based approach miziński and niedzielski 2017 since the snow pit method for pointwise swe sampling is said to be accurate fassnacht et al 2010 for comparison published swe values recorded between february and mid march in a different year on the plateau of the izerskie mountains similar elevations to s1 are of 404 467 kg m 2 kępski et al 2016 and 300 750 kg m 2 figs 1 3 therein bercha et al 2008 to estimate swe in the entire two basins the zonal version of spatial regression has been used the multiple linear regression models fitted within 24 zones being combinations of terrain height 4 zones and distance from the closest obstacles 6 zones have been applied to extrapolate swe see methods the basin scale swe map fig 4g reflects the main patterns of snow accumulation in the izerskie mountains at this stage of snow cover development apart from elevation the most important factor controlling swe is slope aspect north and north eastern slopes are areas with deep snowpack which is particularly visible in concave landforms along the left tributaries of the kwisa river furthermore the influence of land cover mainly vegetation on the deposited snow is also noticeable slightly higher modelled swe values are present in forested areas rather than in meadows or in arable land snowiness is also greater in sparse forest or in treeless terrain along the ridge of wysoki grzbiet where trees are smaller than within steep north and north eastern slopes fig 4g the considerably lower swe values on the slopes of kamienicki grzbiet in comparison to areas located at similar altitudes within wysoki grzbiet are predominantly driven by more favourable insolation conditions slopes inclined towards the south and south west the total swe estimates integrated over basin area are approximately equal to 3 005 10 9 2 955 10 9 and 5 960 10 9 kg for b1 b2 b1 and b2 respectively table 1 since b1 is located closer to the headwaters where elevations are higher than in b2 b1 mean elevation 803 m a s l for b1 and 687 m a s l for b2 b1 it should be expected that b1 has higher swe than b2 b1 however when comparing b1 and b2 b1 in terms of morphometry table 1 there is a considerable difference in terrain aspect while the percentage of north facing slopes is similar in the two basins 35 1 and 38 9 for b1 and b2 b1 respectively the south facing slopes are more frequent in the higher basin b1 23 9 than in the lower interbasin b2 b1 13 8 the insolation effect reduces snow depth in b1 more intensively than in b2 b1 which given the fact that b1 has bigger mean altitudes than b2 b1 causes that the two basin have similar swe there is also another potential factor that may contribute to the rough equality of swe values in the two basins the equality in question may be strengthened by wind effects in the vicinity of mountain ridges in the studied area the prevailing winds are westerlies west facing slopes are more common in b1 26 5 than in b2 b1 18 7 which may lead to more effective reduction of snow depth in the higher basin than in the lower interbasin in addition this reasoning may be strengthened by the analysis of east facing slopes on which wind driven snow from ridges is naturally deposited such slopes are less frequent in b1 14 5 than in b2 b1 28 6 which means that the higher basin has less terrain for wind driven snow to be accumulated 4 2 balancing uav based snow water equivalent with snow melt runoff the concept of validating our new uav based method for retrieving total swe in a small basin is based on comparing swe estimates with snow melt runoff see methods and fig 5 a since 2015 we have collected discharge data at gauges g1 and g2 fig 2b above which the contributing basins are b1 and b2 the discharge data along with meteorological measurements recorded at weather stations fig 2e have been utilized to calibrate the topography based hydrological model topmodel beven and kirkby 1979 enhanced by the species based particle swarm optimization of model parameters cho et al 2011 the high flow events used for calibration occurred on 4 6 october 2016 g1 b1 and 24 29 september 2017 g2 b2 and snow free seasons have been selected to constrain the impact of snowfall treated as rainfall on discharge simulations the nash suttcliffe efficiency nse statistics for the calibration periods are equal to 0 93 and 0 97 for g1 b1 and g2 b2 respectively validation for two week periods after calibration shows the considerable agreement between simulated and measured discharges both for g1 b1 7 23 may 2017 nse 0 80 and g2 b2 7 20 october 2017 nse 0 82 the calibrated topmodel for g1 b1 and g2 b2 has been applied to simulate discharges in the period between uav flights 15 02 2017 and complete snow meltdown detected by the ultrasonic snow sensor 08 04 2017 fig 5d intentionally topmodel without a snow subroutine is used to simulate a possible hypothetical discharge which might have occurred in this period if there had been no snow cover similarly to holko and lepistö 1997 snowfall has been treated as rainfall while running topmodel conceptually measured discharges should be higher than simulated discharges since the simulated curve does not account for melting of snow we believe that the integral of the difference between the measured and simulated discharges over time 15 02 2017 08 04 2017 roughly approximates snow melt runoff which is found to be of about 3 383 10 9 and 5 869 10 9 litres for g1 b1 and g2 b2 respectively fig 5c d the noticeable magnitude of the difference is because melting of snow often controls a significant portion of the runoff in the mountainous terrain e g bair et al 2018 the uav based swe estimates see previous section and table 1 agree well with the approximate snow melt runoff calculations with 11 2 and 1 6 mismatches for the smaller and bigger catchments respectively however the error for the interbasin is equal to 18 9 while calculating the percentage mismatches the theoretical values are snow melt runoff estimates and experimental values correspond to the uav based swe approximations however both values are obtained with uncertainties the error sources of the swe computation are predominantly controlled by the uncertainties in the production the uav based hs maps the calculation of site specific snow densities the spatial statistical extrapolation of swe from test sites to the entire basin in contrast the errors of determining snow melt runoff are mainly driven by the uncertainties in the real time discharge measurements in open channel the mismodelling of discharges caused by processes other than melting of snow validation has also been performed by comparing the basin scale swe reconstruction with pointwise swe data acquired by meteorologists outside the test sites at a single location within the mountain pass of rozdroże izerskie located at 767 m a s l fig 2 the reconstructed equivalent computed as mean swe in the 10 metre buffer around the validation point 91 kg m 2 slightly overestimated measured data at the validation point using the snow pit method 77 kg m 2 5 discussion since snowmelt usually forms a major contribution to total runoff in the mountains the uav based swe estimates can be used to diagnose the magnitude of potential snow melt floods or may be assimilated in hydrologic models indeed blöschl et al 2016 claim that understanding the accumulation of snow and its meltdown may assist in more accurate flood forecasting and peak flow estimation not only the agreement between our swe estimates and the snow melt runoff but also the rapidness of such an on demand approach contributes to its usability when time matters before a potential flooding such a real time swe estimation remains a very recent problem which can be solved for medium sized basins with the use of satellite data bair et al 2018 unfortunately the enhanced resolution of the space borne passive microwave is not suitable to calculate swe in small river basins in real time e g in the studied basins of the upper kwisa river the entire catchment would be covered by a few enhanced 3 125 km 3 125 km grid cells omitting most of the local specificity of snow distribution in this context very important are the findings of krajčí et al 2016 who argue that spatial information on snowmelt is crucial for flood forecasting purposes even in mountainous microcatchments our real time and remotely sensed estimation of total swe and consequently snow melt runoff in small mountain basins accounts for spatial variability of snow and fills the gap between coarse satellite based assessment and labour intensive pointwise sampling of snow under changing climate snow melt floods in both large and small basins in central europe are said to be on the decrease ruiz villanueva et al 2016 also in the odra river basin to which the studied catchments belong mudelsee et al 2003 in the izerskie mountains this is controlled by negative trends in snowiness and winter severity urban et al 2018 our uav based experimental estimation of swe in the two example catchments is therefore impacted and constrained by smaller than usual hs according to recent studies bühler et al 2016 miziński and niedzielski 2017 adams et al 2018 hs fields are reconstructed using the structure from motion sfm algorithm from uav imagery with inaccuracies of a few tens of centimetres although this constraint shallow hs in a warmer climate vs decimetre hs determination error our hs and swe estimates roughly agree within test sites and also the basin scale swe values are well balanced with snow melt runoff as noted above even though it is widely confirmed that in most basins snow melt floods decrease along with global warming there exist some exceptions to this trend e g there are some northern rivers in which the 100 year return discharges remain stable or grow dankers and feyen 2009 in such catchments flood hazards increase with climate change and we believe that in such cases our approach might serve as one of the flood warning tools to mitigate potential negative consequences for humans the economy and the environment also it is known that in a warmer climate shallow snowpack melts earlier and slower than deep old snowpack leading to the reduction of meltwater released due to high melting rates musselman et al 2017 the increased rate of melting may increase flood hazards and our rapid method might help to monitor the risk in addition the ability of our approach to remotely estimate swe and snow melt runoff in a small mountainous catchment where under climate change snow melts in an accelerated fashion might also be used as a diagnostic factor that reduces summer soil moisture across mountain environments gergel et al 2017 6 conclusions here we show the new method for estimating swe in small river basins with high spatial resolution offered by observations of terrain carried out by uavs which provides swe estimates that agree well with snow melt runoff in a small mountainous basin the approach combines the uav based reconstruction of hs in a few test sites using the sfm algorithm with a simplistic snow density estimation to obtain swe in these sites later swe numerical maps for the test sites are utilized to extrapolate swe into the entire basin using spatial regression models the thorough verification and validation of the method is based on field data acquired during a long term experiment in the upper kwisa river basin in the izerskie mountains the sudetes poland the swe estimates are balanced with the reconstructed snow melt runoff the latter being calculated on the basis of topmodel and the radar based discharge time series we arrive at the conclusion that snow melt runoff can be estimated using the proposed uav based method with 11 2 and 1 6 errors for two basins under study which confirms the usefulness of our new approach for the interbasin the error reached 18 9 although it has several limitations described above quality of uav based hs reconstructions simplistic and non spatial estimation of snow density skills and robustness of spatial extrapolation it may serve as a near real time method for early warning against snow melt high flows in river basins impacted by flood risk description of authors

6157,improved hydrological processes simulation and identification of determinants are urgently needed in risk management to reduce socio economic losses resulting from polder water problems this paper improved the lowland polder hydrology and phosphorus modelling system called phps2 0 by coupling the phps modified universal soil loss equation musle and integrated catchments model of phosphorus dynamics inca p then based on the phps2 0 and data collected from the jianwei polder in southeastern china a boosted regression tree brt algorithm was used to explore the key factors determining the temporal variations in polder discharge and phosphorus export the results showed that phps2 0 achieved excellent agreements between the simulated and observed discharge surface water and phosphorus the model performance was significantly improved because field scale phosphorus dynamics were considered the water and phosphorus balances exhibited substantial seasonal changes especially in terms of fertilization crop harvest and discharge the temporal change in catchment discharge mainly depended on precipitation and evaporation which accounted for 63 7 of the discharge variations in contrast the temporal variation in phosphorus export was determined by the crop cover and fertilizer application which accounted for 75 4 of the phosphorus variation to mitigate the phosphorus loss to downstream freshwater it is recommended to remain crop residues reduce the overuse of phosphorus chemical fertilizers and draft emergency plans this study expands the knowledge of the relationship between polder environmental factors and hydrological processes and provides guidance for pollution controls keywords lowland polder model improvement key factor phosphorus dynamics 1 introduction humans have a long history of successfully reclaiming new land from bodies of water leading to the spread of numerous polders in floodplains especially in river deltas seaside and lakeside zones koch et al 2013 shi et al 2018 warner et al 2018 xu and blussé 2018 polders are lowland areas surrounded by dikes that form a controlled hydrologic unit the polder water exchange with external water occurs mainly through artificial devices such as pumps and culverts the increase in global climate change raises the risk of flooding and water pollution in lowland polders especially those under a monsoon climate system with large spatial and temporal oscillations moreover the low elevations slight slopes dense populations and advanced agriculture make polder vulnerable to heavy socio economic losses from natural disasters and environmental deterioration therefore improving risk management is necessary to protect polders from many types of deterioration for alleviating natural and environmental hazards hydrological models are commonly used as an effective tool for risk assessment these model results provide a higher level of understanding of the relationship between driving forces e g precipitation evaporation vegetation management and fertilizer application bornschein and pohl 2018 sterk et al 2016 yu et al 2018 and hydrological processes i e discharge and nutrient processes and can be used to identify the crucial factors which are prerequisites for meeting water related challenges however most of the existing hydrology models such as soil and water assessment tool swat neitsch et al 2011 agricultural nonpoint source pollution agnps young et al 1989 xinanjiang zhao 1992 and gr4j perrin et al 2003 were designed mainly for freely draining catchments thereby making them unsuitable for regulated lowland polders with shallow groundwater tables and pumps capillary forces related to shallow groundwater tables in lowlands substantially affect the vertical soil moisture profile which is replenished by capillary forces during dry periods therefore the vadose zone is closely linked to the groundwater zone forming a tightly coupled system brauer et al 2014 hopmans and van immerzeel 1988 stenitzer et al 2007 due to the wide distribution of surface water and shallow groundwater groundwater discharge and backwater infiltration in lowlands often occur at the groundwater surface water interface brauer et al 2011 to create favourable water conditions for rice growth irrigation and drainage are executed to ensure ponding water levels in paddy rice fields that are neither very low nor very high yan et al 2016 these processes are not considered in the models and errors occur when these models are applied to lowland areas faced with these problems a coupled system called the lowland polder hydrology and phosphorus modelling system phps yan et al 2017 was proposed based on the studies by brauer et al 2014 huang et al 2016 and yan et al 2016 compared to previous version of models the phps expands its application to east asian polders with paddy rice fields and pumping stations such as the polders in china korea and japan with multiple land use types the phps takes into account some processes that are essential for lowland polders with paddy rice fields and pumping stations including the tightly coupled groundwater unsaturated zone surface water groundwater feedback frequent paddy irrigation and drainage discharge controlled by culverts and pumping and the complicated physical and biochemical cycles of phosphorus in surface water however the detailed phosphorus dynamics are not considered at the field scale thus the model fails to fully reflect the phosphorus dynamics in response to environmental changes such as irrigation drainage and fertilization in farmlands as a result the model accuracy is reduced and the identification of critical factors for hydrological processes is limited based on the abovementioned analysis results this study aimed to 1 integrate the phps with a suitable field scale phosphorus model and soil erosion model to provide a better description of hydrological and phosphorus related processes that will overcome the mentioned disadvantages 2 apply the improved phps as well as boosted regression trees brt to identify the key environmental factors that control the culvert and pump discharges at the polder outlet as well as phosphorus loss processes by using data collected from the jianwei polder the improved model and brt analysis results will provide more accurate modelling results and can be used to identify the critical factors for hydrological changes this study will provide some useful insights into the hydrological processes and then deepen the necessary knowledge to improve polder risk management 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data the jianwei polder was selected here because it has a detailed dataset that includes water quantity and quality data which has been applied to the phps development process yan et al 2017 the jianwei polder covers an area of 0 106 km2 and is settled in the northwestern part of the taihu basin in china fig 1 the percentages of paddy fields drylands surface water ditches and ponds and residential areas are 50 1 21 7 19 2 and 9 respectively thus the polder is a representative case for chinese agricultural polders due to the dominance of farmland the soil in the polder is silt loam the land gradually descends from the dike to the centre the polder is inhabited by approximately 100 permanent residents an enclosed dike separates the polder from the surrounding rivers to prevent surrounding floodwater consequently the water and nutrient exchanges between the polder and the surrounding rivers are controlled by water managers through a culvert and three pumps culvert and pump p1 numbered pump used for flood control during the non rice growth period and rice growth period respectively pumps p2 and p3 used for irrigation rainfall runoff and nutrients from the various land use areas are first transported through a ditch and then stored in the pond the water flow from each land use due to rainfall was called rainfall runoff or runoff the water flow from the polder outlet through a human controlled pump and culvert was called discharge in this paper in case the pond water level exceeds a specific threshold level the surplus floodwater is exported by a culvert to the surrounding rivers during the non rice growth period or by a flood pump during the rice growth period during the non rice growth period the culvert is opened to export surplus water to the surrounding river by gravity because the farmland does not need much water during the rice growth period the culvert has to be closed because the polder surface water level is lower than the water level of the surrounding river and rice growth needs substantial water in case of floodwater the pumping station starts to pump water from the polder to the surrounding river during this period in contrast during the dry period irrigation is often implemented by pumping water from the surrounding rivers into the polder to meet the rice water requirements in paddy fields for dryland no irrigation is supplied to the field because wheat and oilseed rape have low water requirements rice wheat rotation is the cropping system in the paddy fields wherein rice is grown from june to october and wheat is from november to may rice seedlings are transplanted into the paddy field in early june a nitrogen fertilizer application rate of 450 kg ha yr and phosphorus fertilizer application rate of 7 88 kg ha yr are usually supplied to farmland for increasing grain yield nevertheless only a portion of the fertilizer is utilized by the crops due to over fertilization and some fertilizers are lost to surface water via runoff and soil erosion huang and gao 2015 thereby increasing the risk of eutrophication taihu basin is an area with serious eutrophication which is partly due to agricultural non point source pollution from lowland areas guo et al 2004 residential areas are another pollution source due to rural living and household scatter breeding of which the pollutants are exported to the surface water due to residential rainfall runoff there is no industrial pollution or a sewage treatment system in this area the jianwei polder belongs to a semi tropical climate zone with an annual mean temperature of 17 c and an annual pan evaporation of 849 mm the average annual precipitation is 1082 mm and more than 70 of annual precipitation occurs between april and september such a high rainfall frequency during this period is more likely to cause soil erosion daily precipitation data were obtained from a rain gauge on site and daily pan evaporation was obtained from the nearest national weather station called liyang station 8 5 km away from the polder the land use data were interpreted from systeme probatoired observation de la terre spot imagery discharges at the outlet q out consisted of pumping and culvert discharges daily pumping drainage was obtained from the pumping capacity and operational time recorded by a local water manager hourly culvert drainage was monitored by an h flume with a water level gauge and stage discharge relation function soil texture data were derived from a particle size analysis of the soil samples at sites g1 g2 and g3 by our research group table s1 yan 2016 the vegetation coverage index of aquatic plants was measured monthly at sites v1 v2 v3 v4 and v5 the water quality data particulate phosphorus pp dissolved phosphorus dp and total phosphorus tp concentrations were obtained from water sampling at sites w1 w2 w3 w4 w5 w6 w7 w8 w9 and w10 and sediment sampling was performed at sites s1 s2 and s3 water samples were collected biweekly at sites w1 w2 and w3 and those at sites w4 w5 w6 w7 w8 w9 and w10 were collected from a rainfall runoff event on 24 august 2013 the sediment samples were collected once in 2013 additionally to test the model s capability to simulate the surface water level an automatic water level gauge was placed in the pond site sl1 to collect the hourly data the study period spanned jan 2015 dec 2016 more detailed descriptions of the data collection are provided in yan et al 2016 2017 2 2 development of lowland polder hydrology and phosphorus modelling system 2 0 2 2 1 lowland polder hydrology and phosphorus modelling system phps the phps is aimed at highly regulated lowland polders with shallow groundwater this model considers not only the important lowland characteristics e g groundwater surface water interaction saturated unsaturated zone coupling and phosphorus related physical and biological processes in the surface water but also human controlled processes frequent artificial irrigation and drainage of paddy field culvert discharge during the non rice growth period and pumping discharge during the rice growth period due to floodwater yan et al 2016 therefore this model was chosen in this study to describe the polder hydrological processes this modelling system consists of four water balance modules i e dryland paddy field surface water and residential area water balance modules and a phosphorus balance module the total phosphorus tp in this model is separated into particulate phosphorus pp and dissolved phosphorus dp the phps has advantages over other models e g swat gr4j and agnps such as a simple model structure only five mass balance modules few parameters to be calibrated only nine water quantity parameters and five water quality parameters table 1 and time saving calculation one year daily modelling takes only 1 min which is shorter than the runtime of other models such as the 10 min required for xinanjiang this system was tested in the jianwei polder eastern china fig 1 using a one year hydro meteorological dataset and was proven to perform well in discharge and phosphorus modelling yan et al 2016 2017 however the phps doesn t consider the phosphorus dynamics in drylands and paddy fields yan et al 2017 consequently the observed phosphorus concentrations of runoff from multiple land use types must be provided by the model user in the current model version this need for observed multi landuse runoff phosphorus data does not facilitate driving the model and limits the further increase in the model precision thus the model needs to be improved by incorporating some modules that describe the field scale phosphorus dynamics in drylands and paddy fields 2 2 2 modified universal soil loss equation musle the musle is one of the most widely used soil erosion models around the world and provides a more accurate modelled result than the original version usle sadeghi et al 2014 williams and berndt 1977 this model has been incorporated in swat and environmental policy integrated climate model epic williams and singh 1995 models the musle neitsch et al 2011 can be described as follows 1 sed 11 8 0 001 f qs q peak a 0 56 k c p control l s c f r g 100 where sed is the amount of soil erosion for a given land use type kg d f qs is the quickflow surface runoff mm d of farmland q peak is the daily peak runoff rate m3 s and a is the catchment area m2 the values of 0 001 and 100 are the factors for converting miscellaneous units to uniform units the estimates of f qs and q peak are based on the simulated results of the phps k c p control ls and cfrg denote soil erodibility vegetation cover and land management soil erosion control practice topographic slope length and slope steepness and coarse fragment factors respectively for the calculation methods of these factors the reader can refer to the supplemental material based on the daily calculated soil erosion the pp concentration of runoff water can be computed as follows 2 p p qs tp p qs f qs a 3 tp p qs c o n c sedp s e d λ p sed where p p qs is the pp concentration of the surface runoff mg l tp p qs is the amount of pp loss with sediment to the surface water in surface runoff kg d con c sedp is the concentration of phosphorus attached to sediment kg kg soil measured and λ p s e d is the ratio of particle phosphorus transported with the sediment to the concentration of the soil surface layer which is estimated with a method proposed by menzel 1980 2 2 3 integrated catchments model of phosphorus dynamics inca p inca p was originally developed by wade et al 2002 as a process based and mass balance model for describing the daily phosphorus dynamics and delivery within catchments this model has been used in many catchments around the world over the past decade jackson blake et al 2016 the model accurately describes the phosphorus dynamics in soil systems in terms of land use types phosphorus forms such as dp consisting of dissolved organic phosphorus dop and dissolved inorganic phosphorus dip and phosphorus sources inca p was therefore coupled with the phps in this study to model dp in the surface runoff more details on the model equations are given in wade et al 2002 and table s2 2 2 4 coupling of phps musle and inca p musle and inca p were coupled with phps on the r language platform to enhance the model s capacity to describe the pp and dp dynamics within the farmland respectively r is an excellent programming language and environment for computing and data analysis venables et al 2009 and has been used to build many hydrological processes models brauer et al 2014 fuka et al 2014 here the phps was used to simulate the rainfall runoff and phosphorus transport processes based on the simulated runoff by the phps the soil erosion owing to rainfall runoff was calculated with the musle inca p was used to represent the field scale phosphorus dynamics the improved version of phps is called phps 2 0 and its conceptual structure for field phosphorus processes in paddy fields is shown in fig 2 table s2 demonstrates the model equations variables and parameters for field phosphorus processes detailed descriptions of the phps 2 0 processes are available in the supplemental material the dryland processes are not displayed here because they are similar to those of paddy fields except for lacking equations to describe hydrological and phosphorus dynamics caused by artificial irrigation and drainage 2 3 model calibration and validation methods in this model nine water quantity parameters c w1 c w2 c v1 c v2 c g1 c g2 c g3 c q1 and c q2 and five water quality parameters k resuspensionmax k settling k mineralization k release and k uptake were adjusted to represent catchment specific characteristics table 1 the meanings of each calibrated parameter can be seen in table 1 the main input dataset for the model consists of meteorological land use discharges at the polder outlet soil texture vegetation coverage and water quality data as discussed in section 2 1 the observed daily discharges at the catchment outlet and the daily surface water level for 2015 and 2016 were employed to calibrate and validate the water quantity parameters table 1 respectively afterwards based on the optimum values of water quantity parameters the biweekly tp of the surface water tp s at site w1 for the years 2015 and 2016 section 2 1 were applied to calibrate and validate the water quantity parameters respectively hydropso zambrano bigiarini and rojas 2013 which is a model independent particle swarm optimisation method for environmental models was used to automatically calibrate the parameters this method is not easily influenced by discontinuities in the response surface and more readily obtains the optimum parameter values than other gradient based techniques moreover we have the experience of this method to calibrate original model yan et al 2017 more information about hydropso is provided in the supplemental material the nash sutcliffe index ns nash and sutcliffe 1970 of the discharges surface water level and tp concentration of the surface water tp s were used as the objective function to calibrate the water quantity and quality parameters respectively the ns coefficient of determination r2 index of agreement d willmott 1981 root mean square error rmse and mean error me were used to evaluate the model performance 2 4 boosted regression trees brt analyses the relationships between discharge and phosphorus export and environmental factors were explored by brt analysis which is a state of the art machine learning method elith et al 2008 yang et al 2016 brt integrates regression trees with a boosting technique to increase the predictive accuracy where a host of tree models are combined with a forward and stage wise procedure the brt is applicable to different types of predictor variables and adapts for missing data prior data transformation and discarding the outliers are not necessary in this method brt automatically handles interaction effects between predictors and has a better predictive performance than most statistical methods in this study 10 environmental variables namely p ir1 h q min1 h q max1 h q flood1 f xg f xs h s min et pot and h s pump stop were selected as the predictor variables to identify the environmental variable that was key to the discharge table 2 in addition to these variables c 1 c 2 tdi p fert 1 tdi p fert 2 and vi were used for phosphorus export the discharge and phosphorus export data used in brt were derived from the continuous output results of phps2 0 and the above mentioned environmental variables were from field investigation from 2015 to 2016 four parameters including loss function ls learning rate lr tree complexity tc and bag fraction bf are need to be defined by the user during brt analysis elith et al 2008 after multiple tests of different parameter combinations the gaussian function 0 0001 1 and 0 5 were set as the parameter values for lr tc and bf respectively to obtain the minimum deviation for discharge whilst the gaussian function 0 001 1 and 0 5 were set for these parameter values to achieve the minimum deviation for phosphorus export all combinations produced no fewer than 1000 trees based on a 10 fold cross validation method the brt analysis was performed in r based on the gbm package ridgeway 2010 and a supplemental script written by elith et al 2008 3 results 3 1 calibration and validation results the model reproduced the discharge at the polder outlet and surface water levels at site sl1 in the pond well during calibration and validation fig 3 a and b the ns and r2 values for the discharge were larger than 0 82 in the calibration and those for surface water level were 0 649 and 0 735 respectively table 3 the validated results for discharge were as good as the calibrated results with ns and r2 values of approximately 0 82 most of the peak and low tp values in surface water were captured well the ns and r2 values were 0 72 and 0 83 in the calibration period respectively and 0 73 and 0 74 in the validation period respectively fig 4 a b and table 3 the model also provided excellent agreement between the modelled and observed pp in surface water although dp was not modelled better than pp because of its high chemical reactivity compared to pp the model still achieved acceptable precision in dp modelling in terms of the statistical assessment indices the optimized values of the model parameters are listed in table 2 3 2 water and phosphorus budgets for the polder the average annual value of the total input water reached 1732 mm yr fig 5 among the input components the annual precipitation of 1535 mm yr contributed the largest proportion to the total input water 89 followed by the irrigation of 195 6 mm yr 11 most of the annual precipitation fell during the summer and autumn and a large difference in the amount of annual precipitation was observed between 2015 1445 mm yr and 2016 1627 mm yr irrigation primarily occurred in summer and autumn june to october which belonged to the rice growth period irrigation is executed to maintain a continuously inundated field for water intensive rice growth more information about the mechanism of irrigation monthly precipitation and temperature is provided in the supplementary material and is not done for drought tolerant wheat which is grown from november to may the average annual amount of the total output water was 1722 2 mm yr the actual evapotranspiration of 803 7 mm yr and discharge of 792 1 mm yr were the two largest output components accounting for 47 and 46 of the total output water respectively seepage accounted for 7 of the output water similar to precipitation discharge and evapotranspiration mostly occurred in summer and autumn 63 9 and 79 5 of the annual amount respectively due to the higher water availability much precipitation higher temperature and more vigorous transpiration than in other seasons furthermore large differences were found in the annual precipitation and discharge between the two years fig 6 displays the annual and seasonal phosphorus balances of the entire polder the data for crop harvest fertilization domestic sewage and human excreta were derived from interviewing local farmers and administrators and referring to the yearbook these data have good accuracy in comparison with the studies in nearby sites pan et al 2013 wang 2010 the remaining data actual evapotranspiration discharge phosphorus input by irrigation and phosphorus export were obtained from the phps2 0 modelled results the average annual amount of the tp input amounted to 8 02 kg ha yr whereas the total output due to crop harvest discharge and seepage was only 3 74 kg ha yr as a result a net retention of 4 28 kg ha yr in the polder soil and surface water system was found implying that the polder could remove phosphorus yan et al 2018 compared to freely draining catchment polder discharge intercepted by the pumping station and embankment decreased substantially attenuating the phosphorus export loads to external rivers moreover the temporary storage of water in the pond increased the retention time for physical and biogeochemical removal processes thereby significantly diminishing the phosphorus concentration in the surface water and discharge fertilization of 5 67 kg ha yr converted from 7 88 kg ha yr for the farmland and domestic sewage and human excreta of 1 32 kg ha yr for the total polder area were the two major contributors to the phosphorus input being responsible for 64 2 and 15 0 respectively crop harvest of 2 29 kg ha yr and discharge of 1 29 kg ha yr constituted most of the phosphorus output 64 and 15 respectively seasonal changes in input components and output components were substantial especially in fertilization crop harvest and discharge a larger amount of phosphate chemical fertilizer amount summer 3 47 kg ha autumn 2 21 kg ha is applied by farmers to the polder before planting rice and wheat in summer and autumn than other seasons leading to increased amounts of phosphorus in the polder during this period more phosphorus 5 67 kg ha yr is extracted from the polder through wheat harvest in early summer and rice harvest in late autumn than in other seasons moreover 1 12 kg ha yr of phosphorus output caused by discharge was also substantial in the same period due to the increased discharge 3 3 brt analysis result the precipitation and pan evaporation had relative effects of 51 5 and 12 2 on discharge q variation respectively table 2 therefore weather elements contributed to 63 7 of the q variation because the chinese polders are commonly situated in humid subtropical areas precipitation and soil moisture condition are the most influential variables for polder discharge water management factors explained 36 of the discharge q variation of which 20 9 was the h q flood1 and 15 1 was h s min a portion of 31 9 24 5 and 19 0 of the variation in phosphorus export was explained by c 1 tdip fert1 and c 2 respectively c 1 represents the vegetation cover and management factor associated with the extent of vegetation cover and prior crop residues which defended the soil against erosion for the paddy field thus it significantly affected the pp transport related to soil erosion tdip fert1 is the amount of inorganic fertilization inputted to paddy fields and thus influences the amount of phosphorus export precipitation contributed 14 2 of the variation illustrating an even smaller effect than illustrated by c 2 4 discussions 4 1 model performance as shown in fig 4a and b the improved model captured the magnitudes and fluctuations of observed phosphorus better than the original model tables 3 and 4 showed that the values of most indices of the improved model were greater than those of the original version these results implied that the performance of the phps model for the phosphorus simulation was significantly improved because field scale phosphorus dynamics were considered according to the result of wellen et al 2015 through an overview of 257 previous case studies of watershed water quality modelling the improved phps model performed better than most of these previous cases this performance was remarkably good especially for lowland polders subjected to the strong human intervention the results for dp were not as good as those for tp and pp 4 2 major influential factors on discharge and phosphorus export the considerable influence of weather variables 63 7 on the discharge variation indicated that the precipitation and evaporation were the crucial environmental variables that affected the temporal variation in polder discharge table 2 water resource management factors such as h q flood1 20 9 were also important factors for the discharge q variation h q flood1 denotes the maximum submergence tolerant water level for paddy fields above which the water level will threaten the rice growth in general once the water depth in paddy fields exceeds h q flood1 during high intensity precipitation manual drainage is implemented to remove redundant floodwater until the water depth decreases to h q max1 a larger h q flood1 led to the removal of more redundant water amounts to h q flood1 minus h q max1 into surface water thereby increasing the peak value of polder discharge unlike discharge which primarily depended on natural variables phosphorus export was governed by agricultural practices c 1 tdip fert1 and c 2 table 2 c 1 was the most important factor 31 9 followed by tdip fert1 24 5 and c 2 19 0 a large c 1 represented poorer vegetation cover and few available crop residues sadeghi et al 2014 which facilitated an increase in soil erosion thereby increasing the phosphorus that adsorbed on the soil particles scoured into freshwater tdip fert1 is the inorganic fertilization amount in fact fertilization is usually the largest source of phosphorus for agricultural polders fig 6 therefore the amount of phosphorus exports was highly sensitive to a larger tdip fert1 because of an increase in phosphorus availability the importance of precipitation decreased from the first to the fourth order in the phosphorus export relative to that in the discharge 4 3 from the current study for risk management 4 3 1 increasing cropland cover residue the brt analysis results revealed that vegetation cover substantially influenced the phosphorus export processes indicating that vegetation cover was the most important factor controlling the phosphorus load exported in the discharge crop residue is an important method of increasing the vegetation cover and preserving nutrients on the one hand protecting crop residue stalks and stubble left in the farmland after the crops have been harvested plays a significant role in increasing the vegetation cover especially during the early crop recovery and tillering period this increasing cover strengthens the ground roughness decreases the flow speed diminishes erosion energy and mitigates the soil and its attached phosphorus losses prasad and power 1991 on the other hand wheat residue retains approximately 25 30 of the phosphorus uptake by wheat and rice straw contains 0 7 1 2 kg ton phosphorus based on dry weight m duxbury et al 2000 for the rice wheat rotation system if no burning no till or reduced till agriculture practices are implemented the remaining residue would reduce the risk of the nutrient and phosphorus losses however residue burning is commonly practiced in rural zones in china as a fast and convenient way to wipe out the crop residue 1 10 1 58 108 ton wang et al 2016a consequently a portion of the phosphorus attached to residue ash is lost to its surrounding water and less organic material is returned to the soil under subtropical monsoon climate miao et al 2011 therefore preventing farmers from burning crop residue is greatly beneficial for promoting yields managing risk and protecting the environment 4 3 2 reducing excessive p fertilizer application to the optimized value required by crop growth in this study both the modelled results of the phosphorus budget and the brt analysis results proved that the phosphorus chemical fertilizer plays a dominant role in phosphorus export from polders to the surrounding environment the jianwei polder produced a tp concentration of 0 11 0 31 mg l in the discharge at the polder outlet polder discharge has the same phosphorus concentration as site w1 in the pond under a 7 88 kg ha yr application rate of phosphorus fertilizer huang et al 2016 to farmlands in comparison the experiment sites from changshu and anzhen in taihu basin with the same cropping system generated a tp of 0 75 1 75 mg l in the discharge at the polder outlet under a phosphorus fertilizer application rate of 50 kg ha yr and 0 91 4 94 mg l under a phosphorus fertilizer application rate of 230 kg ha yr respectively zhang et al 2003a b the results showed that the amount of phosphorus chemical fertilizer determines the phosphorus concentration and load of catchment discharge over application of fertilizer 52 39 kg ha yr deduced from wang et al 2012 is commonly practiced in the other intensive agricultural polders of taihu basin miao and zhang 2011 wang et al 2016b this situation reduced the average coefficient of fertilizer utilization to be only 10 25 lu 1998 wei 2014 and increased the risk of p loss experiments have been conducted to find the optimum amount of phosphorus fertilizer which made agriculture efficient and environmentally friendly miao and zhang 2011 wang et al 2001 2018 2016b zhang et al 2003b for instance the four year pot experimental results of wang et al 2015 2018 using 10 paddy soils with varied phosphorus levels rich moderate and low content showed that a phosphorus fertilizer reduction of approximately 20 50 was feasible to maintain the high crop yield for the rice wheat rotation in taihu basin miao et al 2011 recommended that the sustainable nutrient management mode should accurately match field to field and temproal variations in nutrient supply and crop demand if the over application of fertilizer is abandoned and the optimal amount of fertilizer is applied the risks of phosphors loss from farmland and eutrophication of downstream rivers will be significantly reduced 4 3 3 drafting and initiating an emergency plan to protect the polder from a disaster the improved model in combination with brt analysis provided reliable simulated results and improved quantification of the hydrological response to environmental factors this information can provide references for risk management and emergency plan formation although the effect of environmental factors still needs to be further discussed using additional experimental data from many agricultural polders across taihu basin an emergency plan with multiple measures should be drafted to reduce agricultural loss and environmental problems 4 4 limitations and assumptions compared with the original model the phps coupled with inca p and musle can describe the detailed dynamic changes in phosphorus concentration in dryland and paddy fields thereby supporting the analysis of the phosphorus response to various farmland management techniques e g fertilization irrigation and drainage our study area is a typical chinese agriculture polder in terms of land use weather conditions agricultural water management crop planting and management and water problems thus the results from this case have potential significance for other chinese agricultural polders and can provide a scientific basis for water resource protection however there were still some limitations and assumptions in this study firstly sensitivity and uncertainty analyses of the model were not performed in this study considering the page limit both analyses are beneficial for testing the robustness of the model structure and improving the model performance lu et al 2013 secondly the simulation of dp was not as good as that of tp and pp because of the insufficient description of dp related biogeochemical processes and conversion between inorganic and organic forms many mature empirical formulas such as swat and environmental fluid dynamics code efdc that provide a detailed description of dp dynamics can be easily incorporated into the phps thirdly this study mainly revealed the influence of environmental factors on the temporal distribution of discharge and phosphorus loss based on a typical polder whilst investigating the effects of environmental factors on the spatial variation in hydrological processes based on many lowland polders may also provide insights into efficient water resource and quality management in our future work a dataset including hydro metrological land use population density and agricultural management from all the polders 2539 polders covering 10 630 91 km2 in taihu basin will be collected and used to quantify the relationships between environmental factors e g elevation land use soil water storage capacity and slope and the spatial patterns of hydrological processes at a large basin scale both spatial and temporal analyses can provide comprehensive references for water resource management 5 conclusions this study coupled phps inca p and musle to better account for the hydrological and phosphorous responses to natural and anthropogenic factors the model was calibrated and validated using data collected from the jianwei polder and the results indicated good performance on the basis of the modelled results of the coupled model brt analysis was used to quantify the relationships between environmental factors and hydrological processes the ns and r2 of the discharge were larger than 0 82 in the calibration and approximately 0 82 in the validation the ns and r2 of tp reached 0 72 and 0 83 in the calibration and 0 73 and 0 74 in the validation respectively the good consistency between the simulated and the observed daily values for discharge surface water and different phosphorus forms proved that the model can provide good estimates of polder hydrological processes the comparison of model accuracy between the improved model and the original model implied that the phosphorus modelling performance was significantly improved in this study fertilization of 5 67 kg ha yr and domestic sewage and human excreta of 1 32 kg ha yr were the two major contributors of phosphorus input to jianwei polder crop harvest of 2 29 kg ha yr and discharge of 1 29 kg ha yr were the two largest components of phosphorus output the seasonal changes in phosphorus input and output components were substantial especially in fertilization crop harvest and discharge the weather elements including precipitation and evaporation had a total relative effect of 63 7 on the temporal variation in discharge thereby implying that natural factors played crucial roles in the discharge variation however phosphorus export mainly depended on agricultural practices including crop cover and fertilizer application which contributed 75 4 of the temporal variation in phosphorus export the recommend strategies included optimizing phosphorus fertilizer amounts increasing the cropland cover and drafting an emergency plan all of which would facilitate the mitigation of phosphorus export and reduction of environmental pollution future research will involve uncertainty and sensitivity analyses and explore the key factor influencing the spatial hydrological processes of lowland polders

6157,improved hydrological processes simulation and identification of determinants are urgently needed in risk management to reduce socio economic losses resulting from polder water problems this paper improved the lowland polder hydrology and phosphorus modelling system called phps2 0 by coupling the phps modified universal soil loss equation musle and integrated catchments model of phosphorus dynamics inca p then based on the phps2 0 and data collected from the jianwei polder in southeastern china a boosted regression tree brt algorithm was used to explore the key factors determining the temporal variations in polder discharge and phosphorus export the results showed that phps2 0 achieved excellent agreements between the simulated and observed discharge surface water and phosphorus the model performance was significantly improved because field scale phosphorus dynamics were considered the water and phosphorus balances exhibited substantial seasonal changes especially in terms of fertilization crop harvest and discharge the temporal change in catchment discharge mainly depended on precipitation and evaporation which accounted for 63 7 of the discharge variations in contrast the temporal variation in phosphorus export was determined by the crop cover and fertilizer application which accounted for 75 4 of the phosphorus variation to mitigate the phosphorus loss to downstream freshwater it is recommended to remain crop residues reduce the overuse of phosphorus chemical fertilizers and draft emergency plans this study expands the knowledge of the relationship between polder environmental factors and hydrological processes and provides guidance for pollution controls keywords lowland polder model improvement key factor phosphorus dynamics 1 introduction humans have a long history of successfully reclaiming new land from bodies of water leading to the spread of numerous polders in floodplains especially in river deltas seaside and lakeside zones koch et al 2013 shi et al 2018 warner et al 2018 xu and blussé 2018 polders are lowland areas surrounded by dikes that form a controlled hydrologic unit the polder water exchange with external water occurs mainly through artificial devices such as pumps and culverts the increase in global climate change raises the risk of flooding and water pollution in lowland polders especially those under a monsoon climate system with large spatial and temporal oscillations moreover the low elevations slight slopes dense populations and advanced agriculture make polder vulnerable to heavy socio economic losses from natural disasters and environmental deterioration therefore improving risk management is necessary to protect polders from many types of deterioration for alleviating natural and environmental hazards hydrological models are commonly used as an effective tool for risk assessment these model results provide a higher level of understanding of the relationship between driving forces e g precipitation evaporation vegetation management and fertilizer application bornschein and pohl 2018 sterk et al 2016 yu et al 2018 and hydrological processes i e discharge and nutrient processes and can be used to identify the crucial factors which are prerequisites for meeting water related challenges however most of the existing hydrology models such as soil and water assessment tool swat neitsch et al 2011 agricultural nonpoint source pollution agnps young et al 1989 xinanjiang zhao 1992 and gr4j perrin et al 2003 were designed mainly for freely draining catchments thereby making them unsuitable for regulated lowland polders with shallow groundwater tables and pumps capillary forces related to shallow groundwater tables in lowlands substantially affect the vertical soil moisture profile which is replenished by capillary forces during dry periods therefore the vadose zone is closely linked to the groundwater zone forming a tightly coupled system brauer et al 2014 hopmans and van immerzeel 1988 stenitzer et al 2007 due to the wide distribution of surface water and shallow groundwater groundwater discharge and backwater infiltration in lowlands often occur at the groundwater surface water interface brauer et al 2011 to create favourable water conditions for rice growth irrigation and drainage are executed to ensure ponding water levels in paddy rice fields that are neither very low nor very high yan et al 2016 these processes are not considered in the models and errors occur when these models are applied to lowland areas faced with these problems a coupled system called the lowland polder hydrology and phosphorus modelling system phps yan et al 2017 was proposed based on the studies by brauer et al 2014 huang et al 2016 and yan et al 2016 compared to previous version of models the phps expands its application to east asian polders with paddy rice fields and pumping stations such as the polders in china korea and japan with multiple land use types the phps takes into account some processes that are essential for lowland polders with paddy rice fields and pumping stations including the tightly coupled groundwater unsaturated zone surface water groundwater feedback frequent paddy irrigation and drainage discharge controlled by culverts and pumping and the complicated physical and biochemical cycles of phosphorus in surface water however the detailed phosphorus dynamics are not considered at the field scale thus the model fails to fully reflect the phosphorus dynamics in response to environmental changes such as irrigation drainage and fertilization in farmlands as a result the model accuracy is reduced and the identification of critical factors for hydrological processes is limited based on the abovementioned analysis results this study aimed to 1 integrate the phps with a suitable field scale phosphorus model and soil erosion model to provide a better description of hydrological and phosphorus related processes that will overcome the mentioned disadvantages 2 apply the improved phps as well as boosted regression trees brt to identify the key environmental factors that control the culvert and pump discharges at the polder outlet as well as phosphorus loss processes by using data collected from the jianwei polder the improved model and brt analysis results will provide more accurate modelling results and can be used to identify the critical factors for hydrological changes this study will provide some useful insights into the hydrological processes and then deepen the necessary knowledge to improve polder risk management 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data the jianwei polder was selected here because it has a detailed dataset that includes water quantity and quality data which has been applied to the phps development process yan et al 2017 the jianwei polder covers an area of 0 106 km2 and is settled in the northwestern part of the taihu basin in china fig 1 the percentages of paddy fields drylands surface water ditches and ponds and residential areas are 50 1 21 7 19 2 and 9 respectively thus the polder is a representative case for chinese agricultural polders due to the dominance of farmland the soil in the polder is silt loam the land gradually descends from the dike to the centre the polder is inhabited by approximately 100 permanent residents an enclosed dike separates the polder from the surrounding rivers to prevent surrounding floodwater consequently the water and nutrient exchanges between the polder and the surrounding rivers are controlled by water managers through a culvert and three pumps culvert and pump p1 numbered pump used for flood control during the non rice growth period and rice growth period respectively pumps p2 and p3 used for irrigation rainfall runoff and nutrients from the various land use areas are first transported through a ditch and then stored in the pond the water flow from each land use due to rainfall was called rainfall runoff or runoff the water flow from the polder outlet through a human controlled pump and culvert was called discharge in this paper in case the pond water level exceeds a specific threshold level the surplus floodwater is exported by a culvert to the surrounding rivers during the non rice growth period or by a flood pump during the rice growth period during the non rice growth period the culvert is opened to export surplus water to the surrounding river by gravity because the farmland does not need much water during the rice growth period the culvert has to be closed because the polder surface water level is lower than the water level of the surrounding river and rice growth needs substantial water in case of floodwater the pumping station starts to pump water from the polder to the surrounding river during this period in contrast during the dry period irrigation is often implemented by pumping water from the surrounding rivers into the polder to meet the rice water requirements in paddy fields for dryland no irrigation is supplied to the field because wheat and oilseed rape have low water requirements rice wheat rotation is the cropping system in the paddy fields wherein rice is grown from june to october and wheat is from november to may rice seedlings are transplanted into the paddy field in early june a nitrogen fertilizer application rate of 450 kg ha yr and phosphorus fertilizer application rate of 7 88 kg ha yr are usually supplied to farmland for increasing grain yield nevertheless only a portion of the fertilizer is utilized by the crops due to over fertilization and some fertilizers are lost to surface water via runoff and soil erosion huang and gao 2015 thereby increasing the risk of eutrophication taihu basin is an area with serious eutrophication which is partly due to agricultural non point source pollution from lowland areas guo et al 2004 residential areas are another pollution source due to rural living and household scatter breeding of which the pollutants are exported to the surface water due to residential rainfall runoff there is no industrial pollution or a sewage treatment system in this area the jianwei polder belongs to a semi tropical climate zone with an annual mean temperature of 17 c and an annual pan evaporation of 849 mm the average annual precipitation is 1082 mm and more than 70 of annual precipitation occurs between april and september such a high rainfall frequency during this period is more likely to cause soil erosion daily precipitation data were obtained from a rain gauge on site and daily pan evaporation was obtained from the nearest national weather station called liyang station 8 5 km away from the polder the land use data were interpreted from systeme probatoired observation de la terre spot imagery discharges at the outlet q out consisted of pumping and culvert discharges daily pumping drainage was obtained from the pumping capacity and operational time recorded by a local water manager hourly culvert drainage was monitored by an h flume with a water level gauge and stage discharge relation function soil texture data were derived from a particle size analysis of the soil samples at sites g1 g2 and g3 by our research group table s1 yan 2016 the vegetation coverage index of aquatic plants was measured monthly at sites v1 v2 v3 v4 and v5 the water quality data particulate phosphorus pp dissolved phosphorus dp and total phosphorus tp concentrations were obtained from water sampling at sites w1 w2 w3 w4 w5 w6 w7 w8 w9 and w10 and sediment sampling was performed at sites s1 s2 and s3 water samples were collected biweekly at sites w1 w2 and w3 and those at sites w4 w5 w6 w7 w8 w9 and w10 were collected from a rainfall runoff event on 24 august 2013 the sediment samples were collected once in 2013 additionally to test the model s capability to simulate the surface water level an automatic water level gauge was placed in the pond site sl1 to collect the hourly data the study period spanned jan 2015 dec 2016 more detailed descriptions of the data collection are provided in yan et al 2016 2017 2 2 development of lowland polder hydrology and phosphorus modelling system 2 0 2 2 1 lowland polder hydrology and phosphorus modelling system phps the phps is aimed at highly regulated lowland polders with shallow groundwater this model considers not only the important lowland characteristics e g groundwater surface water interaction saturated unsaturated zone coupling and phosphorus related physical and biological processes in the surface water but also human controlled processes frequent artificial irrigation and drainage of paddy field culvert discharge during the non rice growth period and pumping discharge during the rice growth period due to floodwater yan et al 2016 therefore this model was chosen in this study to describe the polder hydrological processes this modelling system consists of four water balance modules i e dryland paddy field surface water and residential area water balance modules and a phosphorus balance module the total phosphorus tp in this model is separated into particulate phosphorus pp and dissolved phosphorus dp the phps has advantages over other models e g swat gr4j and agnps such as a simple model structure only five mass balance modules few parameters to be calibrated only nine water quantity parameters and five water quality parameters table 1 and time saving calculation one year daily modelling takes only 1 min which is shorter than the runtime of other models such as the 10 min required for xinanjiang this system was tested in the jianwei polder eastern china fig 1 using a one year hydro meteorological dataset and was proven to perform well in discharge and phosphorus modelling yan et al 2016 2017 however the phps doesn t consider the phosphorus dynamics in drylands and paddy fields yan et al 2017 consequently the observed phosphorus concentrations of runoff from multiple land use types must be provided by the model user in the current model version this need for observed multi landuse runoff phosphorus data does not facilitate driving the model and limits the further increase in the model precision thus the model needs to be improved by incorporating some modules that describe the field scale phosphorus dynamics in drylands and paddy fields 2 2 2 modified universal soil loss equation musle the musle is one of the most widely used soil erosion models around the world and provides a more accurate modelled result than the original version usle sadeghi et al 2014 williams and berndt 1977 this model has been incorporated in swat and environmental policy integrated climate model epic williams and singh 1995 models the musle neitsch et al 2011 can be described as follows 1 sed 11 8 0 001 f qs q peak a 0 56 k c p control l s c f r g 100 where sed is the amount of soil erosion for a given land use type kg d f qs is the quickflow surface runoff mm d of farmland q peak is the daily peak runoff rate m3 s and a is the catchment area m2 the values of 0 001 and 100 are the factors for converting miscellaneous units to uniform units the estimates of f qs and q peak are based on the simulated results of the phps k c p control ls and cfrg denote soil erodibility vegetation cover and land management soil erosion control practice topographic slope length and slope steepness and coarse fragment factors respectively for the calculation methods of these factors the reader can refer to the supplemental material based on the daily calculated soil erosion the pp concentration of runoff water can be computed as follows 2 p p qs tp p qs f qs a 3 tp p qs c o n c sedp s e d λ p sed where p p qs is the pp concentration of the surface runoff mg l tp p qs is the amount of pp loss with sediment to the surface water in surface runoff kg d con c sedp is the concentration of phosphorus attached to sediment kg kg soil measured and λ p s e d is the ratio of particle phosphorus transported with the sediment to the concentration of the soil surface layer which is estimated with a method proposed by menzel 1980 2 2 3 integrated catchments model of phosphorus dynamics inca p inca p was originally developed by wade et al 2002 as a process based and mass balance model for describing the daily phosphorus dynamics and delivery within catchments this model has been used in many catchments around the world over the past decade jackson blake et al 2016 the model accurately describes the phosphorus dynamics in soil systems in terms of land use types phosphorus forms such as dp consisting of dissolved organic phosphorus dop and dissolved inorganic phosphorus dip and phosphorus sources inca p was therefore coupled with the phps in this study to model dp in the surface runoff more details on the model equations are given in wade et al 2002 and table s2 2 2 4 coupling of phps musle and inca p musle and inca p were coupled with phps on the r language platform to enhance the model s capacity to describe the pp and dp dynamics within the farmland respectively r is an excellent programming language and environment for computing and data analysis venables et al 2009 and has been used to build many hydrological processes models brauer et al 2014 fuka et al 2014 here the phps was used to simulate the rainfall runoff and phosphorus transport processes based on the simulated runoff by the phps the soil erosion owing to rainfall runoff was calculated with the musle inca p was used to represent the field scale phosphorus dynamics the improved version of phps is called phps 2 0 and its conceptual structure for field phosphorus processes in paddy fields is shown in fig 2 table s2 demonstrates the model equations variables and parameters for field phosphorus processes detailed descriptions of the phps 2 0 processes are available in the supplemental material the dryland processes are not displayed here because they are similar to those of paddy fields except for lacking equations to describe hydrological and phosphorus dynamics caused by artificial irrigation and drainage 2 3 model calibration and validation methods in this model nine water quantity parameters c w1 c w2 c v1 c v2 c g1 c g2 c g3 c q1 and c q2 and five water quality parameters k resuspensionmax k settling k mineralization k release and k uptake were adjusted to represent catchment specific characteristics table 1 the meanings of each calibrated parameter can be seen in table 1 the main input dataset for the model consists of meteorological land use discharges at the polder outlet soil texture vegetation coverage and water quality data as discussed in section 2 1 the observed daily discharges at the catchment outlet and the daily surface water level for 2015 and 2016 were employed to calibrate and validate the water quantity parameters table 1 respectively afterwards based on the optimum values of water quantity parameters the biweekly tp of the surface water tp s at site w1 for the years 2015 and 2016 section 2 1 were applied to calibrate and validate the water quantity parameters respectively hydropso zambrano bigiarini and rojas 2013 which is a model independent particle swarm optimisation method for environmental models was used to automatically calibrate the parameters this method is not easily influenced by discontinuities in the response surface and more readily obtains the optimum parameter values than other gradient based techniques moreover we have the experience of this method to calibrate original model yan et al 2017 more information about hydropso is provided in the supplemental material the nash sutcliffe index ns nash and sutcliffe 1970 of the discharges surface water level and tp concentration of the surface water tp s were used as the objective function to calibrate the water quantity and quality parameters respectively the ns coefficient of determination r2 index of agreement d willmott 1981 root mean square error rmse and mean error me were used to evaluate the model performance 2 4 boosted regression trees brt analyses the relationships between discharge and phosphorus export and environmental factors were explored by brt analysis which is a state of the art machine learning method elith et al 2008 yang et al 2016 brt integrates regression trees with a boosting technique to increase the predictive accuracy where a host of tree models are combined with a forward and stage wise procedure the brt is applicable to different types of predictor variables and adapts for missing data prior data transformation and discarding the outliers are not necessary in this method brt automatically handles interaction effects between predictors and has a better predictive performance than most statistical methods in this study 10 environmental variables namely p ir1 h q min1 h q max1 h q flood1 f xg f xs h s min et pot and h s pump stop were selected as the predictor variables to identify the environmental variable that was key to the discharge table 2 in addition to these variables c 1 c 2 tdi p fert 1 tdi p fert 2 and vi were used for phosphorus export the discharge and phosphorus export data used in brt were derived from the continuous output results of phps2 0 and the above mentioned environmental variables were from field investigation from 2015 to 2016 four parameters including loss function ls learning rate lr tree complexity tc and bag fraction bf are need to be defined by the user during brt analysis elith et al 2008 after multiple tests of different parameter combinations the gaussian function 0 0001 1 and 0 5 were set as the parameter values for lr tc and bf respectively to obtain the minimum deviation for discharge whilst the gaussian function 0 001 1 and 0 5 were set for these parameter values to achieve the minimum deviation for phosphorus export all combinations produced no fewer than 1000 trees based on a 10 fold cross validation method the brt analysis was performed in r based on the gbm package ridgeway 2010 and a supplemental script written by elith et al 2008 3 results 3 1 calibration and validation results the model reproduced the discharge at the polder outlet and surface water levels at site sl1 in the pond well during calibration and validation fig 3 a and b the ns and r2 values for the discharge were larger than 0 82 in the calibration and those for surface water level were 0 649 and 0 735 respectively table 3 the validated results for discharge were as good as the calibrated results with ns and r2 values of approximately 0 82 most of the peak and low tp values in surface water were captured well the ns and r2 values were 0 72 and 0 83 in the calibration period respectively and 0 73 and 0 74 in the validation period respectively fig 4 a b and table 3 the model also provided excellent agreement between the modelled and observed pp in surface water although dp was not modelled better than pp because of its high chemical reactivity compared to pp the model still achieved acceptable precision in dp modelling in terms of the statistical assessment indices the optimized values of the model parameters are listed in table 2 3 2 water and phosphorus budgets for the polder the average annual value of the total input water reached 1732 mm yr fig 5 among the input components the annual precipitation of 1535 mm yr contributed the largest proportion to the total input water 89 followed by the irrigation of 195 6 mm yr 11 most of the annual precipitation fell during the summer and autumn and a large difference in the amount of annual precipitation was observed between 2015 1445 mm yr and 2016 1627 mm yr irrigation primarily occurred in summer and autumn june to october which belonged to the rice growth period irrigation is executed to maintain a continuously inundated field for water intensive rice growth more information about the mechanism of irrigation monthly precipitation and temperature is provided in the supplementary material and is not done for drought tolerant wheat which is grown from november to may the average annual amount of the total output water was 1722 2 mm yr the actual evapotranspiration of 803 7 mm yr and discharge of 792 1 mm yr were the two largest output components accounting for 47 and 46 of the total output water respectively seepage accounted for 7 of the output water similar to precipitation discharge and evapotranspiration mostly occurred in summer and autumn 63 9 and 79 5 of the annual amount respectively due to the higher water availability much precipitation higher temperature and more vigorous transpiration than in other seasons furthermore large differences were found in the annual precipitation and discharge between the two years fig 6 displays the annual and seasonal phosphorus balances of the entire polder the data for crop harvest fertilization domestic sewage and human excreta were derived from interviewing local farmers and administrators and referring to the yearbook these data have good accuracy in comparison with the studies in nearby sites pan et al 2013 wang 2010 the remaining data actual evapotranspiration discharge phosphorus input by irrigation and phosphorus export were obtained from the phps2 0 modelled results the average annual amount of the tp input amounted to 8 02 kg ha yr whereas the total output due to crop harvest discharge and seepage was only 3 74 kg ha yr as a result a net retention of 4 28 kg ha yr in the polder soil and surface water system was found implying that the polder could remove phosphorus yan et al 2018 compared to freely draining catchment polder discharge intercepted by the pumping station and embankment decreased substantially attenuating the phosphorus export loads to external rivers moreover the temporary storage of water in the pond increased the retention time for physical and biogeochemical removal processes thereby significantly diminishing the phosphorus concentration in the surface water and discharge fertilization of 5 67 kg ha yr converted from 7 88 kg ha yr for the farmland and domestic sewage and human excreta of 1 32 kg ha yr for the total polder area were the two major contributors to the phosphorus input being responsible for 64 2 and 15 0 respectively crop harvest of 2 29 kg ha yr and discharge of 1 29 kg ha yr constituted most of the phosphorus output 64 and 15 respectively seasonal changes in input components and output components were substantial especially in fertilization crop harvest and discharge a larger amount of phosphate chemical fertilizer amount summer 3 47 kg ha autumn 2 21 kg ha is applied by farmers to the polder before planting rice and wheat in summer and autumn than other seasons leading to increased amounts of phosphorus in the polder during this period more phosphorus 5 67 kg ha yr is extracted from the polder through wheat harvest in early summer and rice harvest in late autumn than in other seasons moreover 1 12 kg ha yr of phosphorus output caused by discharge was also substantial in the same period due to the increased discharge 3 3 brt analysis result the precipitation and pan evaporation had relative effects of 51 5 and 12 2 on discharge q variation respectively table 2 therefore weather elements contributed to 63 7 of the q variation because the chinese polders are commonly situated in humid subtropical areas precipitation and soil moisture condition are the most influential variables for polder discharge water management factors explained 36 of the discharge q variation of which 20 9 was the h q flood1 and 15 1 was h s min a portion of 31 9 24 5 and 19 0 of the variation in phosphorus export was explained by c 1 tdip fert1 and c 2 respectively c 1 represents the vegetation cover and management factor associated with the extent of vegetation cover and prior crop residues which defended the soil against erosion for the paddy field thus it significantly affected the pp transport related to soil erosion tdip fert1 is the amount of inorganic fertilization inputted to paddy fields and thus influences the amount of phosphorus export precipitation contributed 14 2 of the variation illustrating an even smaller effect than illustrated by c 2 4 discussions 4 1 model performance as shown in fig 4a and b the improved model captured the magnitudes and fluctuations of observed phosphorus better than the original model tables 3 and 4 showed that the values of most indices of the improved model were greater than those of the original version these results implied that the performance of the phps model for the phosphorus simulation was significantly improved because field scale phosphorus dynamics were considered according to the result of wellen et al 2015 through an overview of 257 previous case studies of watershed water quality modelling the improved phps model performed better than most of these previous cases this performance was remarkably good especially for lowland polders subjected to the strong human intervention the results for dp were not as good as those for tp and pp 4 2 major influential factors on discharge and phosphorus export the considerable influence of weather variables 63 7 on the discharge variation indicated that the precipitation and evaporation were the crucial environmental variables that affected the temporal variation in polder discharge table 2 water resource management factors such as h q flood1 20 9 were also important factors for the discharge q variation h q flood1 denotes the maximum submergence tolerant water level for paddy fields above which the water level will threaten the rice growth in general once the water depth in paddy fields exceeds h q flood1 during high intensity precipitation manual drainage is implemented to remove redundant floodwater until the water depth decreases to h q max1 a larger h q flood1 led to the removal of more redundant water amounts to h q flood1 minus h q max1 into surface water thereby increasing the peak value of polder discharge unlike discharge which primarily depended on natural variables phosphorus export was governed by agricultural practices c 1 tdip fert1 and c 2 table 2 c 1 was the most important factor 31 9 followed by tdip fert1 24 5 and c 2 19 0 a large c 1 represented poorer vegetation cover and few available crop residues sadeghi et al 2014 which facilitated an increase in soil erosion thereby increasing the phosphorus that adsorbed on the soil particles scoured into freshwater tdip fert1 is the inorganic fertilization amount in fact fertilization is usually the largest source of phosphorus for agricultural polders fig 6 therefore the amount of phosphorus exports was highly sensitive to a larger tdip fert1 because of an increase in phosphorus availability the importance of precipitation decreased from the first to the fourth order in the phosphorus export relative to that in the discharge 4 3 from the current study for risk management 4 3 1 increasing cropland cover residue the brt analysis results revealed that vegetation cover substantially influenced the phosphorus export processes indicating that vegetation cover was the most important factor controlling the phosphorus load exported in the discharge crop residue is an important method of increasing the vegetation cover and preserving nutrients on the one hand protecting crop residue stalks and stubble left in the farmland after the crops have been harvested plays a significant role in increasing the vegetation cover especially during the early crop recovery and tillering period this increasing cover strengthens the ground roughness decreases the flow speed diminishes erosion energy and mitigates the soil and its attached phosphorus losses prasad and power 1991 on the other hand wheat residue retains approximately 25 30 of the phosphorus uptake by wheat and rice straw contains 0 7 1 2 kg ton phosphorus based on dry weight m duxbury et al 2000 for the rice wheat rotation system if no burning no till or reduced till agriculture practices are implemented the remaining residue would reduce the risk of the nutrient and phosphorus losses however residue burning is commonly practiced in rural zones in china as a fast and convenient way to wipe out the crop residue 1 10 1 58 108 ton wang et al 2016a consequently a portion of the phosphorus attached to residue ash is lost to its surrounding water and less organic material is returned to the soil under subtropical monsoon climate miao et al 2011 therefore preventing farmers from burning crop residue is greatly beneficial for promoting yields managing risk and protecting the environment 4 3 2 reducing excessive p fertilizer application to the optimized value required by crop growth in this study both the modelled results of the phosphorus budget and the brt analysis results proved that the phosphorus chemical fertilizer plays a dominant role in phosphorus export from polders to the surrounding environment the jianwei polder produced a tp concentration of 0 11 0 31 mg l in the discharge at the polder outlet polder discharge has the same phosphorus concentration as site w1 in the pond under a 7 88 kg ha yr application rate of phosphorus fertilizer huang et al 2016 to farmlands in comparison the experiment sites from changshu and anzhen in taihu basin with the same cropping system generated a tp of 0 75 1 75 mg l in the discharge at the polder outlet under a phosphorus fertilizer application rate of 50 kg ha yr and 0 91 4 94 mg l under a phosphorus fertilizer application rate of 230 kg ha yr respectively zhang et al 2003a b the results showed that the amount of phosphorus chemical fertilizer determines the phosphorus concentration and load of catchment discharge over application of fertilizer 52 39 kg ha yr deduced from wang et al 2012 is commonly practiced in the other intensive agricultural polders of taihu basin miao and zhang 2011 wang et al 2016b this situation reduced the average coefficient of fertilizer utilization to be only 10 25 lu 1998 wei 2014 and increased the risk of p loss experiments have been conducted to find the optimum amount of phosphorus fertilizer which made agriculture efficient and environmentally friendly miao and zhang 2011 wang et al 2001 2018 2016b zhang et al 2003b for instance the four year pot experimental results of wang et al 2015 2018 using 10 paddy soils with varied phosphorus levels rich moderate and low content showed that a phosphorus fertilizer reduction of approximately 20 50 was feasible to maintain the high crop yield for the rice wheat rotation in taihu basin miao et al 2011 recommended that the sustainable nutrient management mode should accurately match field to field and temproal variations in nutrient supply and crop demand if the over application of fertilizer is abandoned and the optimal amount of fertilizer is applied the risks of phosphors loss from farmland and eutrophication of downstream rivers will be significantly reduced 4 3 3 drafting and initiating an emergency plan to protect the polder from a disaster the improved model in combination with brt analysis provided reliable simulated results and improved quantification of the hydrological response to environmental factors this information can provide references for risk management and emergency plan formation although the effect of environmental factors still needs to be further discussed using additional experimental data from many agricultural polders across taihu basin an emergency plan with multiple measures should be drafted to reduce agricultural loss and environmental problems 4 4 limitations and assumptions compared with the original model the phps coupled with inca p and musle can describe the detailed dynamic changes in phosphorus concentration in dryland and paddy fields thereby supporting the analysis of the phosphorus response to various farmland management techniques e g fertilization irrigation and drainage our study area is a typical chinese agriculture polder in terms of land use weather conditions agricultural water management crop planting and management and water problems thus the results from this case have potential significance for other chinese agricultural polders and can provide a scientific basis for water resource protection however there were still some limitations and assumptions in this study firstly sensitivity and uncertainty analyses of the model were not performed in this study considering the page limit both analyses are beneficial for testing the robustness of the model structure and improving the model performance lu et al 2013 secondly the simulation of dp was not as good as that of tp and pp because of the insufficient description of dp related biogeochemical processes and conversion between inorganic and organic forms many mature empirical formulas such as swat and environmental fluid dynamics code efdc that provide a detailed description of dp dynamics can be easily incorporated into the phps thirdly this study mainly revealed the influence of environmental factors on the temporal distribution of discharge and phosphorus loss based on a typical polder whilst investigating the effects of environmental factors on the spatial variation in hydrological processes based on many lowland polders may also provide insights into efficient water resource and quality management in our future work a dataset including hydro metrological land use population density and agricultural management from all the polders 2539 polders covering 10 630 91 km2 in taihu basin will be collected and used to quantify the relationships between environmental factors e g elevation land use soil water storage capacity and slope and the spatial patterns of hydrological processes at a large basin scale both spatial and temporal analyses can provide comprehensive references for water resource management 5 conclusions this study coupled phps inca p and musle to better account for the hydrological and phosphorous responses to natural and anthropogenic factors the model was calibrated and validated using data collected from the jianwei polder and the results indicated good performance on the basis of the modelled results of the coupled model brt analysis was used to quantify the relationships between environmental factors and hydrological processes the ns and r2 of the discharge were larger than 0 82 in the calibration and approximately 0 82 in the validation the ns and r2 of tp reached 0 72 and 0 83 in the calibration and 0 73 and 0 74 in the validation respectively the good consistency between the simulated and the observed daily values for discharge surface water and different phosphorus forms proved that the model can provide good estimates of polder hydrological processes the comparison of model accuracy between the improved model and the original model implied that the phosphorus modelling performance was significantly improved in this study fertilization of 5 67 kg ha yr and domestic sewage and human excreta of 1 32 kg ha yr were the two major contributors of phosphorus input to jianwei polder crop harvest of 2 29 kg ha yr and discharge of 1 29 kg ha yr were the two largest components of phosphorus output the seasonal changes in phosphorus input and output components were substantial especially in fertilization crop harvest and discharge the weather elements including precipitation and evaporation had a total relative effect of 63 7 on the temporal variation in discharge thereby implying that natural factors played crucial roles in the discharge variation however phosphorus export mainly depended on agricultural practices including crop cover and fertilizer application which contributed 75 4 of the temporal variation in phosphorus export the recommend strategies included optimizing phosphorus fertilizer amounts increasing the cropland cover and drafting an emergency plan all of which would facilitate the mitigation of phosphorus export and reduction of environmental pollution future research will involve uncertainty and sensitivity analyses and explore the key factor influencing the spatial hydrological processes of lowland polders

6158,to discuss the effects of asymmetrically vegetated floodplains on the velocity distribution characteristics and discharge capacity of a meandering main channel in this paper continuous river bend models with smooth floodplains and one sided vegetated floodplains were designed in a generalized way three dimensional instantaneous velocity data were obtained with an acoustic doppler velocimeter adv and the velocity distribution characteristics and discharge capacities of the generalized models were compared compared with the smooth floodplain conditions the one sided vegetated floodplain conditions are associated with lower cross sectional average velocities lower ratios of main channel discharge to total discharge near the bending apexes with minimal extension of vegetated floodplain but higher ratios near the bending apex with maximal extension of vegetated floodplain the deflection degrees of depth averaged velocities in the meandering main channel are related to the cross sectional position relative depth and floodplain vegetation the depth averaged velocities near the bending apexes are inclined towards the main channel concave sides those in the upstream crossover area are generally inclined towards the vegetated side and those in the downstream crossover area are obviously inclined towards the smooth side for a given relative depth the deflection degrees near the bending apexes are smaller than those in the crossover areas the deflection degrees near the bending apexes with minimal extension of vegetated floodplain are smaller than those under smooth floodplain conditions but the deflection degrees near the bending apex with maximal extension of vegetated floodplain are obviously larger than the corresponding values under smooth floodplain conditions near the bending apexes the longitudinal depth averaged velocities are higher close to the main channel convex side and lower adjacent to the concave side when the relative depth is small one sided vegetated floodplain conditions feature larger transverse gradients of the cross sectional longitudinal depth averaged velocities near the bending apexes with minimal extension of vegetated floodplain when the relative depth is large the transverse gradients near the bending apexes with minimal extension of vegetated floodplain are all much smaller than the corresponding values of the smooth floodplain conditions however near the bending apex with maximal extension of vegetated floodplain there are no significant differences concerning the transverse gradients of the cross sectional longitudinal depth averaged velocities under the both floodplain conditions one sided vegetated floodplain conditions significantly influence the longitudinal velocity distributions in the meandering main channel for a given relative depth the longitudinal velocities at the cross sectional positions under one sided vegetated floodplain conditions are lower than those under smooth

feature in nature and vegetation is an important component of dynamic river systems vegetation exerts important influences on flow resistance flood prevention sediment transport and riverbed evolution therefore many scholars in china and other countries have studied vegetated river systems the research achievements have contributed to understand riverbed evolution mechanisms enrich river dynamics theory and improve river management systems furthermore such research is also significant for engineering problems such as channel training ship navigation floodplain exploitation and ecological restoration vegetation is an important part of river systems but many scholars initially did not consider the vegetational influences when studying the flow characteristics in meandering rivers for example a series of experiments were carried out by ervine et al 1993 wormleaton et al 2004 and rameshwaran and ponnambalam 2015 to investigate the main parameters affecting conveyance in meandering compound channels sellin and lambert 1996 examined the flow conditions in a compound channel with an environmentally acceptable geometry and found that approaches commonly assumed in hydraulic analysis do not account for the large interactions between the floodplains and main channel by measuring the discharges in meandering compound channels under different slopes curvatures and water depths shiono et al 1999 found that the influences of slope and curvature on discharge are important and proposed a method based on dimensional analysis to predict the stage discharge relation based on the depth averaged motion equation in the curvilinear coordinate system spooner and shiono 2003 liu et al 2014 mohanty et al 2014 and tang and knight 2015 proposed new methods for predicting the transverse distributions of depth averaged velocities in meandering channels shao et al 2003 discussed the effect of cross sectional morphology on secondary flow in meandering compound channels patra et al 2004 studied the distribution characteristics of depth averaged velocities in meandering compound channels and found that the distribution patterns before and after the flow exchanges between the floodplains and main channel are significantly different zarrati et al 2005 applied a two dimensional depth averaged model in a nonorthogonal curvilinear coordinate system to successfully predict the water surface profiles and velocity distributions in meandering compound channels an attempt to find feasible calculation methods capable of accurately predicting the cross sectional average velocities was made by karamisheva et al 2006 and they concluded that the yang sediment transport formula applied with the proposed velocity calculation method can yield the best predictions for sediment transport comparing one dimensional numerical models with new experiments carried out in a physical model martin vide et al 2008 concluded that one dimensional numerical models overestimate velocities in the main channel but underestimate them on the floodplains shiono et al 2009 conducted a series of experiments to understand the behaviors of flow resistances and sediment transport rates in meandering compound channels while changing the floodplain roughness morvan et al 2002 and jing et al 2011 conducted numerical simulations to investigate the reproductions of secondary flow vortex blobs and the helical motion in a meandering main channel shan et al 2015 ignored two lower order shear stress terms in governing equations and presented a new method to predict the lateral distributions of depth averaged velocities in meandering compound channels qin et al 2016 evaluated the performances of typical secondary flow correction models in the determination of depth averaged flow as the number of bend flow studies has increased many scholars have realized that the effects of vegetation on bend flow cannot be ignored and have carried out many studies to assess the influences for instance james et al 2001 concluded that vegetation can increase resistance through stem drag but may also decrease resistance by reducing separation at tight bends jarvela 2002 studied how the type density and placement of vegetation influence flow resistance ismail 2007 and ismail and shiono 2008 conducted laboratory experiments in a meandering channel with simulated nonvegetated and vegetated floodplains to investigate how the density and arrangement of floodplain vegetation influence the stage discharge relation flow resistance and sediment transport camporeale and ridolfi 2010 found that the increment of vegetation biomass is not simply equal to the increment of the river length based on an artificial neural network model liu and james 2011 used flow depth vegetation density channel sinuosity transverse floodplain slope and floodplain bend tightness to successfully describe the discharge in meandering compound channels liu et al 2016 analyzed the velocity distribution and structure of secondary flow in meandering compound channels with vegetated floodplains and proposed a new calculation method for the stage discharge relation the flood hydraulics in nonerodible vegetated meandering channels were assessed experimentally by ibrahim et al 2016 to study the stage discharge relation flow resistance depth averaged velocity and boundary shear stress patterns during shallow and deep flood inundations savickis et al 2016 conducted a numerical study to analyze the effect of channel sinuosity and vegetation density on the hydraulic behavior in a channelized wetland shan et al 2017 proposed an analytical model for estimating the stage discharge relation in a meandering compound channel with dense submerged flexible floodplain vegetation under high flow conditions the floodplains of natural meandering compound channels usually have vegetation but the growth stages of the vegetation on either side may differ in fig 1 a in many cases one side features thriving vegetation while the other side is sparsely vegetated in fig 1 b in the literature there are few studies on the velocity distribution characteristics and discharge capacity under the effects of asymmetrically vegetated floodplains therefore in this paper continuous river bend models with smooth floodplains and one sided vegetated floodplains were designed in a generalized way the three dimensional instantaneous velocity data were obtained with an acoustic doppler velocimeter adv and the velocity distribution characteristics and discharge capacities in the meandering compound channels with smooth floodplains and with one sided vegetated floodplains were compared 2 experimental arrangements the experiments were conducted based on a continuous river bend model built in the state key laboratory of hydraulics and mountain river engineering in sichuan university in fig 2 to compare and analyze the velocity distribution characteristics and discharge capacity in the meandering compound channels with one sided vegetated floodplains and smooth floodplains the conditions above were tested the floodplain vegetation was represented by artificial turf in fig 2 c with a density of 11 380 pieces m2 each plant had 12 leaves with a length of 3 cm and a width of 0 9 mm and the average height under the natural state was 2 5 cm the flume was 35 m in length 4 m in width and 1 m in height the longitudinal slope j 0 was 0 001 the upstream end was equipped with pumps a triangulation weir an inlet forebay and an energy dissipation grid the downstream end was equipped with a tail lock and a tail water outlet in the generalized meandering main channel a series of arcs were connected by straight line crossover areas detailed information including the cross sectional width b floodplain height h and meander parameters bending radius r central angle φ meander belt wavelength λ meander belt width w crossover area length l and flow path length l is provided in figs 3 and 4 the flume sidewalls were covered with a guide rail which was equipped with a multidimensional measurement and control system produced by the sinfotek company and the system included a measuring bridge measuring platform laser calibrator motor driving devices and numerical control equipment in addition the measuring bridge and measuring platform can be moved horizontally and vertically via a wireless connection terminal in this paper 3 groups of experiments for the test conditions of smooth floodplains and one sided vegetated floodplains were respectively designed the average longitudinal slope of the water surface within a complete meander was approximately equal to the flume longitudinal slope through discharge control and tail lock adjustment the specific experimental parameters are shown in table 1 due to the periodicity of the experimental meandering compound channel in geometrical morphology and vegetation layout a complete meander in the middle of the experimental flume was selected to conduct the research the red rectangular area in fig 2 is the test area where the flow was stable and the impacts of inflow and outflow were small there were 13 measured cross sections in the test area cs01 cs13 in fig 3 each cross section included 9 test lines 1 9 in fig 4 with a transversal space of 7 cm between the adjacent test lines because of the differences in the relative depth dr h h h the lines featured different spaces between the vertical test points for relative depths of 0 15 and 0 25 the vertical spaces of the test points were 1 5 cm but for the relative depth of 0 35 the vertical spaces were 2 cm the velocity data were measured by an adv specifically the microadv produced by american sontek company can accurately measure three dimensional velocity and generate little interference on the flow the microadv is mainly composed of three parts measuring probes with a nonmeasurable area of 5 cm a signal regulator and a signal processor the sensitivity of the velocity measurement is 0 01 cm s and the measurement accuracy is 0 25 cm s there are five types of measuring probes three dimensional overlook three dimensional elevation three dimensional side view two dimensional side view and cable fixed probe in this experiment two types of measuring probes three dimensional overlook and three dimensional elevation are used before the experiment the device was fixed on the measuring platform of a multidimensional measurement and control system thus the experimenters could conduct longitudinal and vertical manipulation through the wireless connection terminal to make the adv probes meet the measurement requirements according to the analyses of the preliminary experimental results the adv sampling frequency was set to 50 hz and the sampling time of each test point was 30 s 3 results and discussion 3 1 calculational methods of hydraulic parameters in addition to longitudinal velocity u other hydraulic parameters are also used for analysis in this paper longitudinal depth averaged velocity u depth averaged velocity u p cross sectional average velocity of the main channel v m and main channel discharge qm are calculated according to formulas 1

are the components of the measured velocity at a given point along the x and y axes u v and w are the fluctuating velocities at a given point along the x y and z axes b is the main channel width and h is the main channel water depth to facilitate the analyses an orthogonal curvilinear coordinate system as shown in figs 3 and 4 is established its origin is located at the bottom edge midpoint of the initial cross section cs01 and the x axis is along the longitudinal flow path of the meandering main channel extending from the inlet to the outlet the y axis is along the transverse direction of the meandering main channel extending from the right bank to the left bank the z axis is perpendicular to the xoy coordinate plane and upward complying with the right hand screw rule the transverse location parameter is y y b the longitudinal location parameter is x x l and the vertical location parameter is z z h in addition the dimensionless longitudinal velocities are calculated according to u u v s a p e x in which v s a p e x is the cross sectional average velocity at the bending apexes under the smooth floodplain conditions the dimensionless treatment is also conducted for the reynolds

discharge relations of the experimental flume under the conditions of smooth floodplains and one sided vegetated floodplains from the figure the additional resistance produced by the model vegetation has the most significant effect on the discharge capacity of the experimental flume when the relative depth is small and a slight change in discharge causes a significant change in the relative depth for a given discharge the relative depth of the one sided vegetated floodplains is larger than that of the smooth floodplains however the relationship curves for both floodplain conditions become roughly parallel when the relative water depth increases to 0 3 indicating that when the water depth exceeds 0 3 the additional resistance due to model vegetation remains basically unchanged fig 6 indicates that under the smooth floodplain conditions the cross sectional average velocities along the meandering main channel form a w shape the values are higher at the bending apexes and are lower in the crossover areas and they are directly proportional to the relative depth however with the increase in relative depth the cross sectional average velocities increase to a greater degree near the bending apexes than in the crossover areas in contrast under one sided vegetated floodplain conditions the distributions present an approximate λ shape and with an increase in relative depth the cross sectional average velocities near the bending apexes with minimal extension of vegetated floodplain and in the crossover areas all decrease whereas those near the bending apex with maximal extension of vegetated floodplain first increase and then decrease fig 7 shows the ratios of main channel discharge to total discharge qm q under the conditions of smooth floodplains and one sided vegetated floodplains from the figure under smooth floodplain conditions the cross sectional discharges in the bending apexes are high and those in the crossover areas are low and the ratios of main channel discharge to total discharge decrease as the relative depth increases however under one sided vegetated floodplain conditions the cross sectional discharge is highest at the bending apex with maximal extension of vegetated floodplain and lowest near the bending apexes with minimal extension of vegetated floodplain and the qm q ratios of main channel discharge to total discharge in the bends with minimal extension of vegetated floodplain and the crossover areas decrease with the increase of the relative depth nevertheless near the bending apex with maximal extension of vegetated floodplain the qm q ratios first increase and then decrease with an increase in the relative depth when studying the influences of two sided vegetated floodplains on the discharge capacity of a meandering compound channel liu et al 2016 found that the discharge increases with increasing relative depth in two distinct phases in the smooth and grassed channels in the first phase corresponding to dr 0 3 a steep incline is observed whereas in the second phase corresponding to dr 0 3 the discharge increases slowly with increasing flow depth and the stage discharge curves in the smooth and grassed cases appear to be nearly parallel when the relative depth is large the floodplains dominate the experimental flume s discharge capacity the above conclusions are similar to the experimental results under one sided vegetated floodplain conditions but there are also great differences concerning the main channel discharge capacities between one sided vegetated floodplain conditions and two sided vegetated floodplain conditions under two sided vegetated floodplain conditions the largest main channel discharge always occurs at the bending apexes and the smallest discharge is often located near the middle crossover sections cs04 and cs10 however under one sided vegetated floodplain conditions the largest main channel discharge only occurs at the bending apex with maximal extension of vegetated floodplain cs07 and the discharge capacities near the bending apexes with minimal extension of vegetated floodplain are usually smaller the presence of one sided vegetated floodplains significantly enhances the ratios of main channel discharge to total discharge only near the bending apex with maximal extension of vegetated floodplain discharge mainly passes through the main channel only when the relative depth is small when the relative depth is large most discharges pass over the floodplains and the ratios of main channel discharge to floodplain discharge are mainly determined by the cross sectional shapes and transverse widths of the main channel and two adjacent floodplains the conditions of smooth floodplains and one sided vegetated floodplains result in different periodicities concerning the cross sectional average velocities and discharge capacities along the meandering main channel the periodicity under the smooth floodplain conditions is λ 2 but that under one sided vegetated floodplain conditions is λ which is obviously caused by the periodicities of the experimental flume geometry form and the different floodplain conditions under smooth floodplain conditions near the bending apexes the main channel discharges and cross sectional average velocities are all high the main reason is that the processes of the upstream floodplain fluids towards the bending apexes are dominated by the inertia effects and their transverse diffusions are retarded by the main channel flow which causes upstream floodplain fluids to converge at the bending apexes in contrast the upstream floodplain fluid velocities of the bending apexes with minimal extension of vegetated floodplain are reduced due to the retardation of the model vegetation thus in the processes of upstream floodplain fluids towards the bending apex sections under the inertia effects there is enough time for the upstream floodplain fluids to diffuse transversely which appears to reduce the discharge on the vegetated side floodplain and weakens the flow convergence phenomena near the bending apexes with minimal extension of vegetated floodplain therefore the cross sectional average velocities and the qm q ratios near the bending apexes with minimal extension of vegetated floodplain are all low because the upstream area of the bending apex with maximal extension of vegetated floodplain is a smooth floodplain the retardation effect of the smooth floodplain on the fluid is small and the flow velocities on the smooth floodplain are high in addition due to the transverse diffusion of vegetated side floodplain fluid the upstream smooth floodplain of the bending apex with maximal extension of vegetated floodplain acquires a large flow supply therefore when the upstream floodplain fluid of the bending apex with maximal extension of vegetated floodplain flows towards the bending apex under the inertia effect intense convergence occurs and the qm q ratio at the bending apex with maximal extension of vegetated floodplain increases significantly which is a significant finding for actual engineering applications in meandering compound channels associated with one sided vegetated floodplains it is necessary to implement protective engineering measures near the bending apexes with upstream unvegetated floodplains to avoid riverbank collapse 3 3 depth averaged velocity distributions fig 8 indicates the distributions of cross sectional depth averaged velocities and flow dynamic axes along the meandering main channel under the conditions of smooth floodplains and one sided vegetated floodplains the angle between the depth averaged velocity of each measurement line and the cross sectional normal line is defined as the flow deflection angle which is used to quantitatively describe the relative deflection degree of the depth averaged velocity as shown in the figure under one sided vegetated floodplain conditions the deflection degrees of depth averaged velocity in the meandering main channel are related to the cross sectional position relative depth and floodplain vegetation the depth averaged velocities near the bending apexes are inclined towards the main channel concave sides those in the upstream crossover area are roughly inclined towards the vegetated side and those in the downstream crossover area are obviously inclined towards the smooth side for a given relative depth the deflection degrees near the bending apexes are smaller than those in the crossover areas the deflection degrees near the bending apexes with minimal extension of vegetated floodplain are smaller than those under smooth floodplain conditions but the deflection degrees near the bending apex with maximal extension of vegetated floodplain are obviously larger than those under smooth floodplain conditions the centrifugal force always points towards the concave sidewalls from the convex sides near the bending apexes the transverse flow motion due to centrifugal force makes the depth average velocities deviate towards the main channel concave side when the relative depth is small the intrusion intensity of the floodplain flow is relatively weak and the deflection degrees of the depth average velocities mainly depend on the magnitudes of the centrifugal forces in the crossover areas the centrifugal forces caused by curved streamlines are usually small and the deflection degrees largely depend on the intrusion of floodplain flow the presence of model vegetation increases the total resistance of the meandering compound channel thus for a given relative depth under one sided vegetated floodplain conditions the main channel discharges and cross sectional average velocities are lower than those under smooth floodplain conditions further reducing the flow centrifugal forces near the bending apexes with minimal extension of vegetated floodplain therefore the deflection degrees near the bending apexes with minimal extension of vegetated floodplain are smaller than those under smooth floodplain conditions however the situation near the bending apex with maximal extension of vegetated floodplain is fairly different because the upstream area of the bending apex with maximal extension of vegetated floodplain is a smooth floodplain the flow is less impeded and the velocities are relatively higher when the upstream floodplain fluid flows towards the bending apex with maximal extension of vegetated floodplain under the inertia effect intense convergence occurs and results in a large velocity difference between the main channel water surface and the vegetated side floodplain this velocity difference generates a transverse pressure difference from the main channel convex side to the concave side the existence of the transverse pressure difference is bound to promote the deflection degrees under one sided vegetated floodplain conditions as shown in fig 8 the longitudinal depth averaged velocities near the bending apexes are higher close to the main channel convex side and lower adjacent to the concave side when the relative depth is small dr0 15 compared with the smooth floodplain condition the one sided vegetated floodplain condition features larger transverse gradients of the cross sectional longitudinal depth averaged velocities near the bending apexes with minimal extension of vegetated floodplain when the relative depth is large dr0 35 under the condition of one sided vegetated floodplains the transverse gradients near the bending apexes with minimal extension of vegetated floodplain are all much smaller than the corresponding values of the smooth floodplain conditions however near the bending apex with maximal extension of vegetated floodplain there are no significant differences concerning the transverse gradients of the cross sectional longitudinal depth averaged velocities under the both floodplain conditions the bending radius of the main channel curved segments is small and the curvature is large which results in an untimely flow direction adjustment near the main channel concave sides except for the friction retardations near the main channel bottom and the concave sidewalls the fluids near the main channel concave sides are also subject to the head on retardations of the concave sidewalls whereas the fluids near the main channel convex sides are not subject to the head on retardations of the convex sidewalls therefore the longitudinal depth averaged velocities near the main channel convex sides are higher when the relative depth is small dr0 15 the additional resistance of model vegetation to floodplain flow is significant due to the vegetational retardation the velocities of the vegetated side floodplain fluid is less than those near the main channel water surface which makes the vegetated side floodplain fluid produce transverse retardation on the main channel fluid in the bends with minimal extension of vegetated floodplain where the transverse retardation is focused on the main channel concave sides so the transverse gradients of the longitudinal depth averaged velocities are large in contrast when the relative depth is large dr0 35 the proportion of the additional resistance caused by model vegetation to the total flow resistance decreases increasing the flow velocities on the vegetated side floodplain and then the transverse retardation of the vegetated side floodplain fluid to the main channel fluid decreases therefore when the relative depth is large the transverse gradients of the cross sectional longitudinal depth averaged velocities near the bending apexes with minimal extension of vegetated floodplain decrease near the bending apex with maximal extension of vegetated floodplain where the transverse retardation of the vegetated side floodplain fluid on the main channel fluid is focused on the main channel convex side thereby reducing the convex side flow velocities so the transverse distributions of the cross sectional longitudinal depth averaged velocities are relatively uniform the flow dynamic axis also known as the main streamline is the line connecting the points corresponding to the maximum depth averaged velocity in each section the flow deflection degree is closely related to the flow dynamic axis only in a single bend the trend of the flow dynamic axis is largely determined by centrifugal force and the flow dynamic axis and depth averaged velocity near the bending apex are basically inclined towards the riverway concave side however the situation is different in the experimental flume the dynamic axes near the bending apexes are obviously close to the main channel convex side in other words the relationship between the flow deflection angle and dynamic axis is not very close in the experimental meandering compound channel and the main channel curvature and momentum exchange between the floodplains and main channel are the main factors influencing the trend of the flow dynamic axis 3 4 dimensionless longitudinal velocities at the cross sectional positions considering the periodicities of experimental flume geometry form vegetation arrangement and discharge capacities along the meandering main channel three special sections namely cs01 cs04 and cs07 are used to exemplify subsequent analyses fig 9 shows the dimensionless longitudinal velocities at the cross sectional positions when relative depths are respectively 0 15 and 0 35 as shown in the figure relative depth and one sided vegetated floodplain conditions have significant influences on the longitudinal velocity distributions in the meandering main channel for a given relative depth the longitudinal velocities at cross sectional positions under one sided vegetated floodplain conditions are lower than those under smooth floodplain conditions to varying extents the reductions of the longitudinal velocities occur because the one sided floodplain vegetation increases the total resistance of the meandering compound channel thus the main channel discharge for a given relative depth is also reduced when the relative depth is small dr0 15 under the conditions of smooth floodplains and one sided vegetated floodplains the longitudinal velocities in the curved segments are high near the middle parts of the main channel convex side additionally the longitudinal velocities near the convex side of the bend with maximal extension of vegetated floodplain are obviously higher than the corresponding values of the bends with minimal extension of vegetated floodplain this pattern is mainly because the bending radius is small and the curvature is large causing the flow directions near the main channel concave sides to notchangein a timely manner except for the friction retardation near the main channel bottom and concave sidewalls the fluids near the concave sidewalls are also subject to the head on retardations of the concave sidewalls while the fluids near the convex sidewalls are not subject to head on retardations in addition the fluid kinetic energies near the water surface are consumed by the intensive turbulences caused by the momentum exchange between the floodplains and main channel and the kinetic energies near the main channel bottom are also consumed by the friction retardation consequently the areas with larger longitudinal velocities are inclined to the middle parts of the main channel convex sides under one sided vegetated floodplain conditions the vegetated side floodplain fluid is impeded by the model vegetation thus the vegetated side floodplain discharge must be reduced and the reduced discharge referred to as surplus discharge will be reallocated to the smooth side floodplain and main channel because the transverse widths of the concave side vegetated floodplains in the test area are smaller than that of the convex side vegetated floodplain in the test area the vegetated side floodplain with maximal transverse width produces more surplus discharge than the vegetated side floodplains with minimal transverse width however as the transverse widths of convex side smooth floodplains in the test area are larger than that of the concave side smooth floodplain in the test area the main channel discharge in the bend with maximal extension of vegetated floodplain must be larger than those in the bends with minimal extension of vegetated floodplain consequently the longitudinal velocities near the middle parts of the convex side of the bend with maximal extension of vegetated floodplain are obviously higher than the corresponding values of the bends with minimal extension of vegetated floodplain when the relative depth is large dr0 35 the higher longitudinal velocities in the main channel curved segments under smooth floodplain conditions and those in the bend with maximal extension of vegetated floodplain are adjacent to the main channel convex side and near the water surface but the longitudinal velocities in the bends with minimal extension of vegetated floodplain are high in the cross sectional middle parts with the increase of the relative depth the areas near the water surface have exceeded the limited influential ranges of the additional disturbances caused by the sidewalls and the floodplain vegetation which is the fundamental reason for the increases of the longitudinal velocities near the water surface when the relative depth is large the additional resistance generated by the model vegetation only accounts for a small proportion of the total flow resistance so the ratio of surplus discharge caused by the vegetational retardation to the total discharge is reduced however the transverse widths of the convex side smooth floodplains in the test area are larger which makes most discharge pass over the smooth side floodplain because the main channel discharge capacities in the bends with minimal extension of vegetated floodplain are weakened and the cross sectional average velocities are reduced then the head on retardations subjected by the fluids near the main channel concave sides are also weakened thus the areas with high longitudinal velocities move to the cross sectional middle parts liu et al 2016 studied the effects of two sided vegetated floodplains on cross sectional longitudinal velocity distributions and found that the most significant influence of floodplain vegetation on the cross sectional longitudinal velocities occurs at a low relative depth which is probably equal to the deflected grass height the maximum longitudinal velocities in the curved segments appear near the main channel convex side the above conclusions are consistent with the experimental results under one sided vegetated floodplain conditions when the relative depth is the same the longitudinal velocities under two sided vegetated floodplain conditions are generally greater than those under the smooth floodplain conditions however under one sided vegetated floodplain conditions the situation is not necessarily so the longitudinal velocities under one sided vegetated floodplain conditions are larger than those under smooth floodplain conditions only near the bending apex with maximal extension of vegetated floodplain and the longitudinal velocities near the bending apexes with minimal extension of vegetated floodplain are all lower 3 5 relevances between momentum exchange and reynolds stresses as shown in the fig 10 there are generally two secondary flow vortex blobs in cs01 cs04 and cs07 sections the main vortex scales are large and at the upper positions while the minor vortex scales are small and at the lower positions because of the smaller sizes of the minor vortex blobs the main vortex blobs are mainly considered in common hydraulic analyses the overall effects of the main vortexes near the apexes are making the surface fluids flow to main channel concave sides and the bottom fluid flow to the convex sides as is known to all in a single bend the centrifugal force always points towards the concave side from the riverway convex side the driving effect of the centrifugal force makes the water surface near the concave side rise and the water surface near the convex side descend forming transverse water surface gradients under the joint action of centrifugal force and transverse pressure difference due to the transverse water surface gradient the upper fluid flows towards the concave side and the lower fluid flows towards the convex side which forms the secondary flow main vortexes in the single bend the fluid in the experimental meandering main channel is also driven by centrifugal force but why the rotation directions of the main vortex blobs are significantly different compared with those in a single bend is obviously due to the momentum exchange between the floodplains and main channel however for different cross sections along the meandering main channel the causes of the momentum exchange are rather different after the upstream floodplain fluids converge near the bending apexes the transverse flow diffusion is the direct cause of the momentum exchange in the crossover area the momentum exchange is mainly due to the intrusion of the floodplain fluid dominated by itself inertia fig 11 shows the distributions of reynolds stresses r uv and r uw in cs01 cs04 and cs07 sections when the relative depth is 0 15 the existence of the reynolds stress layers near the water surfaces and with larger vertical gradients is the direct evidence of the transverse momentum exchange between the floodplains and main channel the vertical gradient values of the reynolds stress layers near the water surfaces are also a quantitative characterization of the transverse momentum exchange under one sided vegetated floodplain conditions the vertical gradients of the reynolds stress layers near the water surfaces are obviously larger than the corresponding values under smooth floodplain conditions indicating that the additional turbulence caused by floodplain vegetation can be transmitted to main channel through the transverse momentum exchange and exacerbate the flow turbulence in addition why the cross sectional longitudinal velocities near the water surfaces when the relative depth is 0 15 are all smaller is closely related to the turbulent dissipation caused by the momentum exchange 4 conclusions a series of laboratory experiments were conducted in meandering compound channels with smooth floodplains and one sided vegetated floodplains the model grass density was similar to that in the field detailed measurements were acquired in thirteen cross sections along the meandering main channel for low medium and high relative depths dr0 15 dr0 25 and dr0 35 respectively the findings in this paper will help readers understand the direct impacts of one sided vegetated floodplains on velocity distribution characteristics and discharge capacity in the meandering main channel several conclusions can be drawn 1 discharge mainly passes through the main channel only when the relative depth is low when the relative depth is large most discharges pass over the floodplains under the conditions of smooth floodplains and one sided vegetated floodplains the cross sectional average velocities of the main channel and the qm q ratios are different under smooth floodplain conditions near the bending apexes the cross sectional average velocities and main channel discharges are high however the cross sectional average velocities and the qm q ratios near the bending apexes with minimal extension of vegetated floodplain are lower than those under smooth floodplain conditions whereas the ratios near the bending apex with maximal extension of vegetated floodplain are much larger 2 under one sided vegetated floodplain conditions the deflection degrees of depth averaged velocities in the meandering main channel are related to the cross sectional position relative depth and floodplain vegetation the depth averaged velocities near the bending apexes are inclined towards the main channel concave sides those in the upstream crossover area are roughly inclined towards the vegetated side and those in the downstream crossover area are obviously inclined towards the smooth side for a given relative depth the deflection degrees near the bending apexes are smaller than those in the crossover areas the deflection degrees near the bending apexes with minimal extension of vegetated floodplain are smaller than those under smooth floodplain conditions but the deflection degrees near the bending apex with maximal extension of vegetated floodplain are obviously larger than the corresponding values under smooth floodplain conditions 3 near the bending apexes the longitudinal depth averaged velocities are higher close to the main channel convex side and lower adjacent to the concave side when the relative depth is small dr0 15 compared with the smooth floodplain condition the one sided vegetated floodplain condition features larger transverse gradients of the cross sectional longitudinal depth averaged velocities near the bending apexes with minimal extension of vegetated floodplain when the relative depth is large dr0 35 the transverse gradients near the bending apexes with minimal extension of vegetated floodplain are all much smaller than those under the condition of smooth floodplains however near the bending apex with maximal extension of vegetated floodplain there are no significant differences concerning the transverse gradients of the cross sectional longitudinal depth averaged velocities under the both floodplain conditions 4 relative depth and one sided vegetated floodplain conditions significantly influence the longitudinal velocity distributions in the meandering main channel for a given relative depth the longitudinal velocities at the cross sectional positions under one sided vegetated floodplain conditions are lower than those under smooth floodplain conditions to varying extents when the relative depth is 0 15 under the both floodplain conditions the longitudinal velocities in the curved segments are high near the middle parts of the main channel convex side furthermore the longitudinal velocities near the convex side of the bend with maximal extension of vegetated floodplain are obviously larger than the corresponding values near the convex sides of the bends with minimal extension of vegetated floodplain when the relative depth is 0 35 the high

6158,to discuss the effects of asymmetrically vegetated floodplains on the velocity distribution characteristics and discharge capacity of a meandering main channel in this paper continuous river bend models with smooth floodplains and one sided vegetated floodplains were designed in a generalized way three dimensional instantaneous velocity data were obtained with an acoustic doppler velocimeter

feature in nature and vegetation is an important component of dynamic river systems vegetation exerts important influences on flow resistance flood prevention sediment transport and riverbed evolution therefore many scholars in china and other countries have studied vegetated river systems the research achievements have contributed to understand riverbed evolution mechanisms enrich river dynamics theory and improve river management systems furthermore such research is also significant for engineering problems such as channel training ship navigation floodplain exploitation and ecological restoration vegetation is an important part of river systems but many scholars initially did not consider the vegetational influences when studying the flow characteristics in meandering rivers for example a series of experiments were carried out by ervine et al 1993 wormleaton et al 2004 and rameshwaran and ponnambalam 2015 to investigate the main parameters affecting conveyance in meandering compound channels sellin and lambert 1996 examined the flow conditions in a compound channel with an environmentally acceptable geometry and found that approaches commonly assumed in hydraulic analysis do not account for the large interactions between the floodplains and main channel by measuring the discharges in meandering compound channels under different slopes curvatures and water depths shiono et al 1999 found that the influences of slope and curvature on discharge are important and proposed a method based on dimensional analysis to predict the stage discharge relation based on the depth averaged motion equation in the curvilinear coordinate system spooner and shiono 2003 liu et al 2014 mohanty et al 2014 and tang and knight 2015 proposed new methods for predicting the transverse distributions of depth averaged velocities in meandering channels shao et al 2003 discussed the effect of cross sectional morphology on secondary flow in meandering compound channels patra et al 2004 studied the distribution characteristics of depth averaged velocities in meandering compound channels and found that the distribution patterns before and after the flow exchanges between the floodplains and main channel are significantly different zarrati et al 2005 applied a two dimensional depth averaged model in a nonorthogonal curvilinear coordinate system to successfully predict the water surface profiles and velocity distributions in meandering compound channels an attempt to find feasible calculation methods capable of accurately predicting the cross sectional average velocities was made by karamisheva et al 2006 and they concluded that the yang sediment transport formula applied with the proposed velocity calculation method can yield the best predictions for sediment transport comparing one dimensional numerical models with new experiments carried out in a physical model martin vide et al 2008 concluded that one dimensional numerical models overestimate velocities in the main channel but underestimate them on the floodplains shiono et al 2009 conducted a series of experiments to understand the behaviors of flow resistances and sediment transport rates in meandering compound channels while changing the floodplain roughness morvan et al 2002 and jing et al 2011 conducted numerical simulations to investigate the reproductions of secondary flow vortex blobs and the helical motion in a meandering main channel shan et al 2015 ignored two lower order shear stress terms in governing equations and presented a new method to predict the lateral distributions of depth averaged velocities in meandering compound channels qin et al 2016 evaluated the performances of typical secondary flow correction models in the determination of depth averaged flow as the number of bend flow studies has increased many scholars have realized that the effects of vegetation on bend flow cannot be ignored and have carried out many studies to assess the influences for instance james et al 2001 concluded that vegetation can increase resistance through stem drag but may also decrease resistance by reducing separation at tight bends jarvela 2002 studied how the type density and placement of vegetation influence flow resistance ismail 2007 and ismail and shiono 2008 conducted laboratory experiments in a meandering channel with simulated nonvegetated and vegetated floodplains to investigate how the density and arrangement of floodplain vegetation influence the stage discharge relation flow resistance and sediment transport camporeale and ridolfi 2010 found that the increment of vegetation biomass is not simply equal to the increment of the river length based on an artificial neural network model liu and james 2011 used flow depth vegetation density channel sinuosity transverse floodplain slope and floodplain bend tightness to successfully describe the discharge in meandering compound channels liu et al 2016 analyzed the velocity distribution and structure of secondary flow in meandering compound channels with vegetated floodplains and proposed a new calculation method for the stage discharge relation the flood hydraulics in nonerodible vegetated meandering channels were assessed experimentally by ibrahim et al 2016 to study the stage discharge relation flow resistance depth averaged velocity and boundary shear stress patterns during shallow and deep flood inundations savickis et al 2016 conducted a numerical study to analyze the effect of channel sinuosity and vegetation density on the hydraulic behavior in a channelized wetland shan et al 2017 proposed an analytical model for estimating the stage discharge relation in a meandering compound channel with dense submerged flexible floodplain vegetation under high flow conditions the floodplains of natural meandering compound channels usually have vegetation but the growth stages of the vegetation on either side may differ in fig 1 a in many cases one side features thriving vegetation while the other side is sparsely vegetated in fig 1 b in the literature there are few studies on the velocity distribution characteristics and discharge capacity under the effects of asymmetrically vegetated floodplains therefore in this paper continuous river bend models with smooth floodplains and one sided vegetated floodplains were designed in a generalized way the three dimensional instantaneous velocity data were obtained with an acoustic doppler velocimeter adv and the velocity distribution characteristics and discharge capacities in the meandering compound channels with smooth floodplains and with one sided vegetated floodplains were compared 2 experimental arrangements the experiments were conducted based on a continuous river bend model built in the state key laboratory of hydraulics and mountain river engineering in sichuan university in fig 2 to compare and analyze the velocity distribution characteristics and discharge capacity in the meandering compound channels with one sided vegetated floodplains and smooth floodplains the conditions above were tested the floodplain vegetation was represented by artificial turf in fig 2 c with a density of 11 380 pieces m2 each plant had 12 leaves with a length of 3 cm and a width of 0 9 mm and the average height under the natural state was 2 5 cm the flume was 35 m in length 4 m in width and 1 m in height the longitudinal slope j 0 was 0 001 the upstream end was equipped with pumps a triangulation weir an inlet forebay and an energy dissipation grid the downstream end was equipped with a tail lock and a tail water outlet in the generalized meandering main channel a series of arcs were connected by straight line crossover areas detailed information including the cross sectional width b floodplain height h and meander parameters bending radius r central angle φ meander belt wavelength λ meander belt width w crossover area length l and flow path length l is provided in figs 3 and 4 the flume sidewalls were covered with a guide rail which was equipped with a multidimensional measurement and control system produced by the sinfotek company and the system included a measuring bridge measuring platform laser calibrator motor driving devices and numerical control equipment in addition the measuring bridge and measuring platform can be moved horizontally and vertically via a wireless connection terminal in this paper 3 groups of experiments for the test conditions of smooth floodplains and one sided vegetated floodplains were respectively designed the average longitudinal slope of the water surface within a complete meander was approximately equal to the flume longitudinal slope through discharge control and tail lock adjustment the specific experimental parameters are shown in table 1 due to the periodicity of the experimental meandering compound channel in geometrical morphology and vegetation layout a complete meander in the middle of the experimental flume was selected to conduct the research the red rectangular area in fig 2 is the test area where the flow was stable and the impacts of inflow and outflow were small there were 13 measured cross sections in the test area cs01 cs13 in fig 3 each cross section included 9 test lines 1 9 in fig 4 with a transversal space of 7 cm between the adjacent test lines because of the differences in the relative depth dr h h h the lines featured different spaces between the vertical test points for relative depths of 0 15 and 0 25 the vertical spaces of the test points were 1 5 cm but for the relative depth of 0 35 the vertical spaces were 2 cm the velocity data were measured by an adv specifically the microadv produced by american sontek company can accurately measure three dimensional velocity and generate little interference on the flow the microadv is mainly composed of three parts measuring probes with a nonmeasurable area of 5 cm a signal regulator and a signal processor the sensitivity of the velocity measurement is 0 01 cm s and the measurement accuracy is 0 25 cm s there are five types of measuring probes three dimensional overlook three dimensional elevation three dimensional side view two dimensional side view and cable fixed probe in this experiment two types of measuring probes three dimensional overlook and three dimensional elevation are used before the experiment the device was fixed on the measuring platform of a multidimensional measurement and control system thus the experimenters could conduct longitudinal and vertical manipulation through the wireless connection terminal to make the adv probes meet the measurement requirements according to the analyses of the preliminary experimental results the adv sampling frequency was set to 50 hz and the sampling time of each test point was 30 s 3 results and discussion 3 1 calculational methods of hydraulic parameters in addition to longitudinal velocity u other hydraulic parameters are also used for analysis in this

are the components of the measured velocity at a given point along the x and y axes u v and w are the fluctuating velocities at a given point along the x y and z axes b is the main channel width and h is the main channel water depth to facilitate the analyses an orthogonal curvilinear coordinate system as shown in figs 3 and 4 is established its origin is located at the bottom edge midpoint of the initial cross section cs01 and the x axis is along the longitudinal flow path of the meandering main channel extending from the inlet to the outlet the y axis is along the transverse direction of the meandering main channel extending from the right bank to the left bank the z axis is perpendicular to the xoy coordinate plane and upward complying with the right hand screw rule the transverse location parameter is y y b the longitudinal location parameter is x x l and the vertical location parameter is z z h in addition the dimensionless longitudinal velocities are calculated according to u u v s a p e x in which v s a p e x is the cross sectional average velocity at the bending apexes under the smooth floodplain conditions the dimensionless treatment is also conducted for the reynolds

discharge relations of the experimental flume under the conditions of smooth floodplains and one sided vegetated floodplains from the figure the additional resistance produced by the model vegetation has the most significant effect on the discharge capacity of the experimental flume when the relative depth is small and a slight change in discharge causes a significant change in the relative depth for a given discharge the relative depth of the one sided vegetated floodplains is larger than that of the smooth floodplains however the relationship curves for both floodplain conditions become roughly parallel when the relative water depth increases to 0 3 indicating that when the water depth exceeds 0 3 the additional resistance due to model vegetation remains basically unchanged fig 6 indicates that under the smooth floodplain conditions the cross sectional average velocities along the meandering main channel form a w shape the values are higher at the bending apexes and are lower in the crossover areas and they are directly proportional to the relative depth however with the increase in relative depth the cross sectional average velocities increase to a greater degree near the bending apexes than in the crossover areas in contrast under one sided vegetated floodplain conditions the distributions present an approximate λ shape and with an increase in relative depth the cross sectional average velocities near the bending apexes with minimal extension of vegetated floodplain and in the crossover areas all decrease whereas those near the bending apex with maximal extension of vegetated floodplain first increase and then decrease fig 7 shows the ratios of main channel discharge to total discharge qm q under the conditions of smooth floodplains and one sided vegetated floodplains from the figure under smooth floodplain conditions the cross sectional discharges in the bending apexes are high and those in the crossover areas are low and the ratios of main channel discharge to total discharge decrease as the relative depth increases however under one sided vegetated floodplain conditions the cross sectional discharge is highest at the bending apex with maximal extension of vegetated floodplain and lowest near the bending apexes with minimal extension of vegetated floodplain and the qm q ratios of main channel discharge to total discharge in the bends with minimal extension of vegetated floodplain and the crossover areas decrease with the increase of the relative depth nevertheless near the bending apex with maximal extension of vegetated floodplain the qm q ratios first increase and then decrease with an increase in the relative depth when studying the influences of two sided vegetated floodplains on the discharge capacity of a meandering compound channel liu et al 2016 found that the discharge increases with increasing relative depth in two distinct phases in the smooth and grassed channels in the first phase corresponding to dr 0 3 a steep incline is observed whereas in the second phase corresponding to dr 0 3 the discharge increases slowly with increasing flow depth and the stage discharge curves in the smooth and grassed cases appear to be nearly parallel when the relative depth is large the floodplains dominate the experimental flume s discharge capacity the above conclusions are similar to the experimental results under one sided vegetated floodplain conditions but there are also great differences concerning the main channel discharge capacities between one sided vegetated floodplain conditions and two sided vegetated floodplain conditions under two sided vegetated floodplain conditions the largest main channel discharge always occurs at the bending apexes and the smallest discharge is often located near the middle crossover sections cs04 and cs10 however under one sided vegetated floodplain conditions the largest main channel discharge only occurs at the bending apex with maximal extension of vegetated floodplain cs07 and the discharge capacities near the bending apexes with minimal extension of vegetated floodplain are usually smaller the presence of one sided vegetated floodplains significantly enhances the ratios of main channel discharge to total discharge only near the bending apex with maximal extension of vegetated floodplain discharge mainly passes through the main channel only when the relative depth is small when the relative depth is large most discharges pass over the floodplains and the ratios of main channel discharge to floodplain discharge are mainly determined by the cross sectional shapes and transverse widths of the main channel and two adjacent floodplains the conditions of smooth floodplains and one sided vegetated floodplains result in different periodicities concerning the cross sectional average velocities and discharge capacities along the meandering main channel the periodicity under the smooth floodplain conditions is λ 2 but that under one sided vegetated floodplain conditions is λ which is obviously caused by the periodicities of the experimental flume geometry form and the different floodplain conditions under smooth floodplain conditions near the bending apexes the main channel discharges and cross sectional average velocities are all high the main reason is that the processes of the upstream floodplain fluids towards the bending apexes are dominated by the inertia effects and their transverse diffusions are retarded by the main channel flow which causes upstream floodplain fluids to converge at the bending apexes in contrast the upstream floodplain fluid velocities of the bending apexes with minimal extension of vegetated floodplain are reduced due to the retardation of the model vegetation thus in the processes of upstream floodplain fluids towards the bending apex sections under the inertia effects there is enough time for the upstream floodplain fluids to diffuse transversely which appears to reduce the discharge on the vegetated side floodplain and weakens the flow convergence phenomena near the bending apexes with minimal extension of vegetated floodplain therefore the cross sectional average velocities and the qm q ratios near the bending apexes with minimal extension of vegetated floodplain are all low because the upstream area of the bending apex with maximal extension of vegetated floodplain is a smooth floodplain the retardation effect of the smooth floodplain on the fluid is small and the flow velocities on the smooth floodplain are high in addition due to the transverse diffusion of vegetated side floodplain fluid the upstream smooth floodplain of the bending apex with maximal extension of vegetated floodplain acquires a large flow supply therefore when the upstream floodplain fluid of the bending apex with maximal extension of vegetated floodplain flows towards the bending apex under the inertia effect intense convergence occurs and the qm q ratio at the bending apex with maximal extension of vegetated floodplain increases significantly which is a significant finding for actual engineering applications in meandering compound channels associated with one sided vegetated floodplains it is necessary to implement protective engineering measures near the bending apexes with upstream unvegetated floodplains to avoid riverbank collapse 3 3 depth averaged velocity distributions fig 8 indicates the distributions of cross sectional depth averaged velocities and flow dynamic axes along the meandering main channel under the conditions of smooth floodplains and one sided vegetated floodplains the angle between the depth averaged velocity of each measurement line and the cross sectional normal line is defined as the flow deflection angle which is used to quantitatively describe the relative deflection degree of the depth averaged velocity as shown in the figure under one sided vegetated floodplain conditions the deflection degrees of depth averaged velocity in the meandering main channel are related to the cross sectional position relative depth and floodplain vegetation the depth averaged velocities near the bending apexes are inclined towards the main channel concave sides those in the upstream crossover area are roughly inclined towards the vegetated side and those in the downstream crossover area are obviously inclined towards the smooth side for a given relative depth the deflection degrees near the bending apexes are smaller than those in the crossover areas the deflection degrees near the bending apexes with minimal extension of vegetated floodplain are smaller than those under smooth floodplain conditions but the deflection degrees near the bending apex with maximal extension of vegetated floodplain are obviously larger than those under smooth floodplain conditions the centrifugal force always points towards the concave sidewalls from the convex sides near the bending apexes the transverse flow motion due to centrifugal force makes the depth average velocities deviate towards the main channel concave side when the relative depth is small the intrusion intensity of the floodplain flow is relatively weak and the deflection degrees of the depth average velocities mainly depend on the magnitudes of the centrifugal forces in the crossover areas the centrifugal forces caused by curved streamlines are usually small and the deflection degrees largely depend on the intrusion of floodplain flow the presence of model vegetation increases the total resistance of the meandering compound channel thus for a given relative depth under one sided vegetated floodplain conditions the main channel discharges and cross sectional average velocities are lower than those under smooth floodplain conditions further reducing the flow centrifugal forces near the bending apexes with minimal extension of vegetated floodplain therefore the deflection degrees near the bending apexes with minimal extension of vegetated floodplain are smaller than those under smooth floodplain conditions however the situation near the bending apex with maximal extension of vegetated floodplain is fairly different because the upstream area of the bending apex with maximal extension of vegetated floodplain is a smooth floodplain the flow is less impeded and the velocities are relatively higher when the upstream floodplain fluid flows towards the bending apex with maximal extension of vegetated floodplain under the inertia effect intense convergence occurs and results in a large velocity difference between the main channel water surface and the vegetated side floodplain this velocity difference generates a transverse pressure difference from the main channel convex side to the concave side the existence of the transverse pressure difference is bound to promote the deflection degrees under one sided vegetated floodplain conditions as shown in fig 8 the longitudinal depth averaged velocities near the bending apexes are higher close to the main channel convex side and lower adjacent to the concave side when the relative depth is small dr0 15 compared with the smooth floodplain condition the one sided vegetated floodplain condition features larger transverse gradients of the cross sectional longitudinal depth averaged velocities near the bending apexes with minimal extension of vegetated floodplain when the relative depth is large dr0 35 under the condition of one sided vegetated floodplains the transverse gradients near the bending apexes with minimal extension of vegetated floodplain are all much smaller than the corresponding values of the smooth floodplain conditions however near the bending apex with maximal extension of vegetated floodplain there are no significant differences concerning the transverse gradients of the cross sectional longitudinal depth averaged velocities under the both floodplain conditions the bending radius of the main channel curved segments is small and the curvature is large which results in an untimely flow direction adjustment near the main channel concave sides except for the friction retardations near the main channel bottom and the concave sidewalls the fluids near the main channel concave sides are also subject to the head on retardations of the concave sidewalls whereas the fluids near the main channel convex sides are not subject to the head on retardations of the convex sidewalls therefore the longitudinal depth averaged velocities near the main channel convex sides are higher when the relative depth is small dr0 15 the additional resistance of model vegetation to floodplain flow is significant due to the vegetational retardation the velocities of the vegetated side floodplain fluid is less than those near the main channel water surface which makes the vegetated side floodplain fluid produce transverse retardation on the main channel fluid in the bends with minimal extension of vegetated floodplain where the transverse retardation is focused on the main channel concave sides so the transverse gradients of the longitudinal depth averaged velocities are large in contrast when the relative depth is large dr0 35 the proportion of the additional resistance caused by model vegetation to the total flow resistance decreases increasing the flow velocities on the vegetated side floodplain and then the transverse retardation of the vegetated side floodplain fluid to the main channel fluid decreases therefore when the relative depth is large the transverse gradients of the cross sectional longitudinal depth averaged velocities near the bending apexes with minimal extension of vegetated floodplain decrease near the bending apex with maximal extension of vegetated floodplain where the transverse retardation of the vegetated side floodplain fluid on the main channel fluid is focused on the main channel convex side thereby reducing the convex side flow velocities so the transverse distributions of the cross sectional longitudinal depth averaged velocities are relatively uniform the flow dynamic axis also known as the main streamline is the line connecting the points corresponding to the maximum depth averaged velocity in each section the flow deflection degree is closely related to the flow dynamic axis only in a single bend the trend of the flow dynamic axis is largely determined by centrifugal force and the flow dynamic axis and depth averaged velocity near the bending apex are basically inclined towards the riverway concave side however the situation is different in the experimental flume the dynamic axes near the bending apexes are obviously close to the main channel convex side in other words the relationship between the flow deflection angle and dynamic axis is not very close in the experimental meandering compound channel and the main channel curvature and momentum exchange between the floodplains and main channel are the main factors influencing the trend of the flow dynamic axis 3 4 dimensionless longitudinal velocities at the cross sectional positions considering the periodicities of experimental flume geometry form vegetation arrangement and discharge capacities along the meandering main channel three special sections namely cs01 cs04 and cs07 are used to exemplify subsequent analyses fig 9 shows the dimensionless longitudinal velocities at the cross sectional positions when relative depths are respectively 0 15 and 0 35 as shown in the figure relative depth and one sided vegetated floodplain conditions have significant influences on the longitudinal velocity distributions in the meandering main channel for a given relative depth the longitudinal velocities at cross sectional positions under one sided vegetated floodplain conditions are lower than those under smooth floodplain conditions to varying extents the reductions of the longitudinal velocities occur because the one sided floodplain vegetation increases the total resistance of the meandering compound channel thus the main channel discharge for a given relative depth is also reduced when the relative depth is small dr0 15 under the conditions of smooth floodplains and one sided vegetated floodplains the longitudinal velocities in the curved segments are high near the middle parts of the main channel convex side additionally the longitudinal velocities near the convex side of the bend with maximal extension of vegetated floodplain are obviously higher than the corresponding values of the bends with minimal extension of vegetated floodplain this pattern is mainly because the bending radius is small and the curvature is large causing the flow directions near the main channel concave sides to notchangein a timely manner except for the friction retardation near the main channel bottom and concave sidewalls the fluids near the concave sidewalls are also subject to the head on retardations of the concave sidewalls while the fluids near the convex sidewalls are not subject to head on retardations in addition the fluid kinetic energies near the water surface are consumed by the intensive turbulences caused by the momentum exchange between the floodplains and main channel and the kinetic energies near the main channel bottom are also consumed by the friction retardation consequently the areas with larger longitudinal velocities are inclined to the middle parts of the main channel convex sides under one sided vegetated floodplain conditions the vegetated side floodplain fluid is impeded by the model vegetation thus the vegetated side floodplain discharge must be reduced and the reduced discharge referred to as surplus discharge will be reallocated to the smooth side floodplain and main channel because the transverse widths of the concave side vegetated floodplains in the test area are smaller than that of the convex side vegetated floodplain in the test area the vegetated side floodplain with maximal transverse width produces more surplus discharge than the vegetated side floodplains with minimal transverse width however as the transverse widths of convex side smooth floodplains in the test area are larger than that of the concave side smooth floodplain in the test area the main channel discharge in the bend with maximal extension of vegetated floodplain must be larger than those in the bends with minimal extension of vegetated floodplain consequently the longitudinal velocities near the middle parts of the convex side of the bend with maximal extension of vegetated floodplain are obviously higher than the corresponding values of the bends with minimal extension of vegetated floodplain when the relative depth is large dr0 35 the higher longitudinal velocities in the main channel curved segments under smooth floodplain conditions and those in the bend with maximal extension of vegetated floodplain are adjacent to the main channel convex side and near the water surface but the longitudinal velocities in the bends with minimal extension of vegetated floodplain are high in the cross sectional middle parts with the increase of the relative depth the areas near the water surface have exceeded the limited influential ranges of the additional disturbances caused by the sidewalls and the floodplain vegetation which is the fundamental reason for the increases of the longitudinal velocities near the water surface when the relative depth is large the additional resistance generated by the model vegetation only accounts for a small proportion of the total flow resistance so the ratio of surplus discharge caused by the vegetational retardation to the total discharge is reduced however the transverse widths of the convex side smooth floodplains in the test area are larger which makes most discharge pass over the smooth side floodplain because the main channel discharge capacities in the bends with minimal extension of vegetated floodplain are weakened and the cross sectional average velocities are reduced then the head on retardations subjected by the fluids near the main channel concave sides are also weakened thus the areas with high longitudinal velocities move to the cross sectional middle parts liu et al 2016 studied the effects of two sided vegetated floodplains on cross sectional longitudinal velocity distributions and found that the most significant influence of floodplain vegetation on the cross sectional longitudinal velocities occurs at a low relative depth which is probably equal to the deflected grass height the maximum longitudinal velocities in the curved segments appear near the main channel convex side the above conclusions are consistent with the experimental results under one sided vegetated floodplain conditions when the relative depth is the same the longitudinal velocities under two sided vegetated floodplain conditions are generally greater than those under the smooth floodplain conditions however under one sided vegetated floodplain conditions the situation is not necessarily so the longitudinal velocities under one sided vegetated floodplain conditions are larger than those under smooth floodplain conditions only near the bending apex with maximal extension of vegetated floodplain and the longitudinal velocities near the bending apexes with minimal extension of vegetated floodplain are all lower 3 5 relevances between momentum exchange and reynolds stresses as shown in the fig 10 there are generally two secondary flow vortex blobs in cs01 cs04 and cs07 sections the main vortex scales are large and at the upper positions while the minor vortex scales are small and at the lower positions because of the smaller sizes of the minor vortex blobs the main vortex blobs are mainly considered in common hydraulic analyses the overall effects of the main vortexes near the apexes are making the surface fluids flow to main channel concave sides and the bottom fluid flow to the convex sides as is known to all in a single bend the centrifugal force always points towards the concave side from the riverway convex side the driving effect of the centrifugal force makes the water surface near the concave side rise and the water surface near the convex side descend forming transverse water surface gradients under the joint action of centrifugal force and transverse pressure difference due to the transverse water surface gradient the upper fluid flows towards the concave side and the lower fluid flows towards the convex side which forms the secondary flow main vortexes in the single bend the fluid in the experimental meandering main channel is also driven by centrifugal force but why the rotation directions of the main vortex blobs are significantly different compared with those in a single bend is obviously due to the momentum exchange between the floodplains and main channel however for different cross sections along the meandering main channel the causes of the momentum exchange are rather different after the upstream floodplain fluids converge near the bending apexes the transverse flow diffusion is the direct cause of the momentum exchange in the crossover area the momentum exchange is mainly due to the intrusion of the floodplain fluid dominated by itself inertia fig 11 shows the distributions of reynolds stresses r uv and r uw in cs01 cs04 and cs07 sections when the relative depth is 0 15 the existence of the reynolds stress layers near the water surfaces and with larger vertical gradients is the direct evidence of the transverse momentum exchange between the floodplains and main channel the vertical gradient values of the reynolds stress layers near the water surfaces are also a quantitative characterization of the transverse momentum exchange under one sided vegetated floodplain conditions the vertical gradients of the reynolds stress layers near the water surfaces are obviously larger than the corresponding values under smooth floodplain conditions indicating that the additional turbulence caused by floodplain vegetation can be transmitted to main channel through the transverse momentum exchange and exacerbate the flow turbulence in addition why the cross sectional longitudinal velocities near the water surfaces when the relative depth is 0 15 are all smaller is closely related to the turbulent dissipation caused by the momentum exchange 4 conclusions a series of laboratory experiments were conducted in meandering compound channels with smooth floodplains and one sided vegetated floodplains the model grass density was similar to that in the field detailed measurements were acquired in thirteen cross sections along the meandering main channel for low medium and high relative depths dr0 15 dr0 25 and dr0 35 respectively the findings in this paper will help readers understand the direct impacts of one sided vegetated floodplains on velocity distribution characteristics and discharge capacity in the meandering main channel several conclusions can be drawn 1 discharge mainly passes through the main channel only when the relative depth is low when the relative depth is large most discharges pass over the floodplains under the conditions of smooth floodplains and one sided vegetated floodplains the cross sectional average velocities of the main channel and the qm q ratios are different under smooth floodplain conditions near the bending apexes the cross sectional average velocities and main channel discharges are high however the cross sectional average velocities and the qm q ratios near the bending apexes with minimal extension of vegetated floodplain are lower than those under smooth floodplain conditions whereas the ratios near the bending apex with maximal extension of vegetated floodplain are much larger 2 under one sided vegetated floodplain conditions the deflection degrees of depth averaged velocities in the meandering main channel are related to the cross sectional position relative depth and floodplain vegetation the depth averaged velocities near the bending apexes are inclined towards the main channel concave sides those in the upstream crossover area are roughly inclined towards the vegetated side and those in the downstream crossover area are obviously inclined towards the smooth side for a given relative depth the deflection degrees near the bending apexes are smaller than those in the crossover areas the deflection degrees near the bending apexes with minimal extension of vegetated floodplain are smaller than those under smooth floodplain conditions but the deflection degrees near the bending apex with maximal extension of vegetated floodplain are obviously larger than the corresponding values under smooth floodplain conditions 3 near the bending apexes the longitudinal depth averaged velocities are higher close to the main channel convex side and lower adjacent to the concave side when the relative depth is small dr0 15 compared with the smooth floodplain condition the one sided vegetated floodplain condition features larger transverse gradients of the cross sectional longitudinal depth averaged velocities near the bending apexes with minimal extension of vegetated floodplain when the relative depth is large dr0 35 the transverse gradients near the bending apexes with minimal extension of vegetated floodplain are all much smaller than those under the condition of smooth floodplains however near the bending apex with maximal extension of vegetated floodplain there are no significant differences concerning the transverse gradients of the cross sectional longitudinal depth averaged velocities under the both floodplain conditions 4 relative depth and one sided vegetated floodplain conditions significantly influence the longitudinal velocity distributions in the meandering main channel for a given relative depth the longitudinal velocities at the cross sectional positions under one sided vegetated floodplain conditions are lower than those under smooth floodplain conditions to varying extents when the relative depth is 0 15 under the both floodplain conditions the longitudinal velocities in the curved segments are high near the middle parts of the main channel convex side furthermore the longitudinal velocities near the convex side of the bend with maximal extension of vegetated floodplain are obviously larger than the corresponding values near the convex sides of the bends with minimal extension of vegetated floodplain when the relative depth is 0 35 the high longitudinal velocities in the main channel curved segments under smooth floodplain conditions and those in the bend with maximal extension of vegetated floodplain are adjacent to the main channel

6159,groundwater resource exploitations as one of the most valuable water resources cause conflicts among beneficiaries due to different priorities in decision making processes these conflicts lead beneficiaries to decide non cooperatively consequently it is essential to consider non cooperative decision making in order to manage groundwater resources properly in this study non cooperative game theory was applied to groundwater resource management this methodology was employed in bad khaledabad study area located in the center of iran also quantity and quality simulation and optimization models were used to calculate the payoffs of beneficiaries including farmers and government in order to understand beneficiaries non cooperative decision making three games were examined called cropping pattern shift efficiency improvement and linked game the stable solution obtained for the linked game was the scenario where farmers choose to change their cropping patterns which will increase the farmers profit by up to us 3 280 000 and government limits groundwater withdrawals to 66 5 mcm and pays for efficiency improvements which will raise the groundwater table 2m at the end of the fifth year keywords groundwater management non cooperative game theory modflow mt3dms multi objectives optimization 1 introduction resources and goods can be classified into four groups private public toll and common pool based on their subtractability and excludability according to this classification common pool resources are characterized by high subtractability and difficult exclusion one of which is groundwater resource ostrom et al 1994 due to the fact that groundwater exploitation and regulation are shared by numerous stakeholders with conflicts of interests the groundwater resources management is very complicated and costly in common pool resources management in order to investigate the beneficiaries conflicts of interest and assessing the impact of their behavior on the outcome conflict resolution theories can be applied game theory is one of the most commonly used theories and a framework for making an informed managerial decision by means of studying the behavior of the involved stakeholders myerson 2013 game theory provides a more realistic insight into how the stakeholders called player respond to each other s actions in the application of game theory it is assumed that each stakeholder tries to maximize his own gain called payoff yet knowing the actions of other players also affects this gain madani 2010 groundwater resources management institutions as common pools can be classified in three types exogenous regulatory institutions as well as cooperative and non cooperative management madani and dinar 2011 in general cooperative management has gained greater interest in groundwater resources management because of its resemblance to optimization approach loáiciga 2004 madani and dinar 2012a raquel et al 2007 in the optimization based methods the problem is often transformed into a single strategy and single decision maker which reveals a number of shortcomings a series of recent studies has focused on the application of simulation methods optimization approaches and cooperative institutions in groundwater resources management simultaneously alizadeh et al 2017 bazargan lari et al 2009 farhadi et al 2016 lópez corona et al 2013 parsapour moghaddam et al 2015 in cooperative management institutions all stakeholders collaborate to yield the best global utility nevertheless stakeholders preferences are maximizing their individual objectives which leads to behave non cooperatively madani and hipel 2011 therefore non cooperative institutions can be applied to achieve better effectiveness by introducing more realism into the modeling of stakeholders decision making processes limited number of prior studies were found on the application of non cooperative concepts in water resources management fang et al 1993 madani and dinar 2012b madani and hipel 2007 mahjouri and ardestani 2011 in the application of non cooperative institutions two challenging issues should be considered i the need to reconcile the conflicting interests of many beneficiaries and ii the existence of externalities which may affect groundwater level to address the first challenge it is essential to define groundwater beneficiaries and their objectives groundwater stakeholders can be divided into two categories groundwater users and groundwater regulators therefore conflicts among beneficiaries may exist intra sectoral e g among farmers or inter sectoral e g between farmers and the government in this study in order to focus on the first challenging issue conflict of interests between two main stakeholders namely the government and farmers inter sectoral conflicts are considered the basic premise of this study is that farmers are assumed to have a cooperative intra sectoral behavior have a unified front the withdrawal from wells which leads to the groundwater levels decline may be considered as externalities madani and dinar 2012b in this study all farmers are represented by a single stakeholder that protects their preferences in the interaction with the government the variables including well withdrawal by farmers groundwater level fluctuations and the farmers cultivation profits as determinants of the stakeholders decision making procedures are estimated utilizing a linked simulation optimization model accordingly the main objectives of this study are as follows examining the decision making processes between farmers and the government who are unwilling to cooperate assessing impacts of their foresight on decision making processes and investigating the possibility of reaching a cooperative solution in the absence of farmers and government cooperation behavior in the following sections the research method is elaborated including an introduction to modflow and mt3d simulation models the optimization model structure and non cooperative stability definitions then the study area is presented for implementation of the proposed method finally the results of models are presented 2 methodology as shown in fig 1 the research methodology can be divided into three main sections groundwater quantity and quality simulation simulation optimization model and examination of farmers and government non cooperative decision making process according to the fig 1 two objectives of farmers and government are simultaneously optimized the optimal results of this section will be obtained based on the assumption that stakeholders cooperatively participate to gain system s objectives 2 1 groundwater quantity and quality simulation in the present study modflow groundwater

consider the aquifer as an integrated body it can also simulate different water containing layers as confined unconfined or a combination of both in this model it is also possible to simulate the areal recharge evapotranspiration flow to wells flow to drains and flow through riverbeds mt3d model which is developed by zheng 1990 under the supervision of the us environmental protection agency usepa is a common model for simulating the transport of solute in groundwater mt3d is a three dimensional modular that is capable of simulating the advection dispersion and chemical reactions of

confined and semi confined aquifers and model the transport of solutes under different recharge and drain conditions 2 2 groundwater optimization model in this study in order to assess the interaction between main groundwater stakeholders including groundwater users and regulators farmers and government are considered with opposed objectives and preferences the optimization model consists of two objectives i farmer s objective that refers to maximizing farmers total profit during the modeling period eq 3 and ii government objective which is minimizing the mean groundwater level drawdown eq 4 decision variables of this model include the monthly allocation of groundwater to each product and the cultivated area ca of each product during the optimization period 3 max z 1 d 1 d b d c d 4 min z

products on the crop yield eq 6 the higher the ec value the less water will be available for products and since the water availability directly affects the yield the higher water salinity reduces the yield of products table 1 presents assumptions of this study according to the impact of water salinity on the yield of products bauder et al 2011 the constraints of the optimization model are as

product in the same zone in this study pareto solutions are obtained using a nsgaii based meta heuristic genetic algorithm detailed information about this algorithm is provided in srinivas and deb 1994 studies moreover complex proportional assessment copras is used to select among the obtained pareto points in the previous steps in which a weight of 0 5 is assigned to both objectives the present study used the copras method because it is a multi factorial decision making method with simplicity of calculation low calculation time ranking total pareto points simultaneous use of quantitative and qualitative criteria ability to separately calculate positive criteria maximum and negative criteria minimum in the evaluation process ability to estimate the degree of importance of each option as percentages in order to indicate better or worse size of an option and the ability to adapt to local and empirical conditions further information about the copras method can be found in a research by zavadskas and kaklauskas 1996 2 3 application of non cooperative stability in the context of the application of game theory in groundwater resource management firstly it is necessary to define the main concepts according to the problem of interest one of the main components of every game is the players here players are the two stakeholders of the groundwater exploitation management issue namely the farmers and the government although each of these stakeholders consists of multiple components with their own intra sectoral interactions this study only considers the decisions of each stakeholder as a whole and ignores the intra sectoral interactions the other main components of the game are options or strategies in this study each player s available strategies are determined by scenario building in a simulation optimization model the payoff of players for each available scenario is calculated utilizing a simulation model in modflow and mt3dms followed by a two objective optimization model the payoffs of farmers and the government for each scenario are respectively the profit value given by eq 3 and the groundwater level variation given by eq 4 the stable solution of a non cooperative game can be determined by several ways namely nash general meta rationality gmr symmetric meta rationality smr and sequential stability seq types of stability can be categorized based on three criteria i foresight ii willingness to disimprovement and iii knowledge about preferences fang et al 1989 selbirak 1994 in this study the behavior of farmers and the government are examined by the use of non cooperative stabilities nash stability indicates decision making process based on the assumption that each decision maker is only aware of his own priorities also both farmers and the government have a limited foresight meaning that they can only anticipate one response of the other player to their own decisions in the nash solution concept it is assumed that farmers are only interested in increasing their profit and the government only seeks to reduce the groundwater drawdown which indicates both players are risk averse the disadvantage of nash stability is the limited foresight which means farmers and the government will choose the option with the best apparent payoff without considering the other stakeholder counter move since farmers and the government make decisions based on their past experiences and can predict the opponent counter moves other types of stabilities should be considered to avoid the shortcoming of the nash concept gmr is a stability concept which is only applicable to the games where players perform at least two moves madani and hipel 2011 in the gmr concept each player can anticipate the opponent counter move and makes a decision accordingly while farmers and the government s knowledge and past experiences allow them to anticipate the opponent s reactions gmr can be a proper choice for modeling stakeholders behavior the gmr stability solution indicates that farmers will choose the strategy that guarantees their payoff would not be declined by the government response the same also applies to the government seq stability takes a similar approach to the game as gmr but assumes that players are not interested in reducing the opponent s payoff accordingly unlike in gmr farmers are optimistic in assessing the government s response and believe that the government is seeking to reduce drawdown not the cultivation profits this stability perfectly reflects the circumstances of the studied case as the government has consistently proven its intention to reduce the groundwater drawdown with a minimum financial losses for farmers the last considered stability is smr which is similar to gmr with the difference that farmers and the government both have greater foresight and can anticipate three future moves and counter moves in this study the smr concept is applied to assess effects of stakeholders high foresights on their behaviors decision making procedures and the eventual outcomes in the following sections different games between farmers and the government are defined based on the study area characteristics then the matrix form of each game is constructed based on the modeling results and relevant game definitions finally in each game the defined non cooperative stabilities are considered to investigate the stakeholders behavior in responding to each game features in this study different non cooperative solution concepts are applied to assess the effects of foresights risk averseness and knowledge of stakeholders on the process of decision making 3 study area to study the performance and efficiency of this methodology it is tested for bad khaledabad region located in siahkouh basin in isfahan and yazd provinces in center of iran bad khaledabad sub basin has an area of 1851 4 km2 and is located in the northwest of the catchment between 51 20 and 52 20 longitudes and 33 20 and 36 00 latitudes according to collected data this region has 173 wells 9 qanats and a spring with a total annual discharge of 86 86 mcm of which 79 2 mcm is from wells the location of the study area in iran and the location of groundwater exploitation points are displayed in fig 2 the study area is divided into three zones based on changes in the groundwater level table during 1996 2016 zone 1 with increasing water levels in recent years zone 2 in the middle area with the highest cultivation density and the largest decline in water level during the 5 year period of simulation and zone 3 with a continues water fluctuation moreover the optimal water allocation is done monthly for a 5 year period in each zone six ca variables which represent dominant crops namely barley alfalfa wheat corn onions and cantaloupe are considered in each zone hence there are a total of 5 12 6 3 18 1098 decision variables in the optimization model in the presented methodology the groundwater pumping costs is applied to the farmers profit as a costs factor which also may serve the government s objective minimizing the drawdown however farmers of the study area pay such a low price for electricity that they may not actually feel effects of drawdown on the groundwater exploitation expenses the objective function is based on achieving a more realistic estimate of the cultivation costs generally the presence of costs in the objective function brings it closer to the reality of the existing situation 4 results in this study there are general assumptions as follows 1 there are only two beneficiaries government and farmers who have opposite objectives of minimizing the groundwater extraction and maximizing the economic benefit 2 salinity is considered as a qualitative parameter whose impact on the crop yield is considered 3 no game is defined among farmers and intra sectoral interactions are not investigated in the following sections the results of groundwater quantity and quality simulation model are presented then the results of linked simulation and optimization model and developed scenarios are expressed in the third part the results of three game model including cropping pattern shift efficiency improvement and linked games are explained 4 1 results of groundwater quantity and quality simulation groundwater flow modeling was performed in the groundwater modeling system gms software first a conceptual model was built by introducing the position and specification of the study area and then the entire aquifer area was divided into a 1000 1000 grid the groundwater simulation model of bad khaledabad region was calibrated in two steps 1 using the steady flow for the period of 22 june 2011 to 22 september 2011 and 2 using the transient flow for the period of 22 september 2011 to 22 september 2013 in 24 monthly steps table 2 shows the maximum error mean error and root mean square error rmse of modflow and mt3dms results for the calibration and validation period the listed low error values in this table indicate the reasonable accuracy of the groundwater flow simulation model the predicted and observed water levels of nine observation wells in the study area during the validation period are illustrated in fig 3 a in this study salinity is considered as a qualitative parameter because based on the available information in the study area it is examined that while other quality parameters such as phosphate and nitrate have not exceeded the standard values salinity is at the standard threshold and can reduce the crop yield accordingly salinity effects are applied in the optimization model both in the constraint and the crop yield function the simulation of groundwater salinity was performed by the help of electrical conductivity ec parameter since this parameter is not defined in mt3dms tds 0 665ec was used to convert the electrical conductivity ec to total dissolved solids tds as in the mt3dms model the error of groundwater quality simulation also indicated the reasonable accuracy of water salinity modeling in the study area fig 3 b shows predicted and observed tds values for nine observation wells in the study area during the validation period 4 2 simulation multi objective optimization model the simulation multi objectives optimization model smo operates in the following steps specifying the optimization constraints running the optimization model in order to determine the amounts of groundwater allocated to farmers importing the obtained groundwater exploitation values into the simulation model modflow and mt3dms in order to determine water and salinity levels in the study area exporting the obtained water and salinity levels back to the optimization model and calculating the second objective minimizing water level drawdown and repeating the steps above until fulfilling the termination condition the smo model was implemented in the following three strategies in order to examine how beneficiaries government and farmers choose possible strategies 1 continuation of current condition the ca of each product was considered equal to the mean ca in a 5 year historical period and the water level variation was considered to be identical to modflow simulation 2 optimal cropping pattern based on the current condition the smo model was run according to the equations 3 12 to calculate changes in the ca of six products in three zones it aimed to determine the appropriate cropping pattern that could be achieved in the current condition in eq 12 adp min 0 8 adp mean and adp max 1 2 adp mean where adp mean is equal to mean area of crop p in zone d during 1996 2016 3 cropping pattern shift the ca was reallocated from water intensive and less profitable products to more profitable products with relatively lower water requirement this strategy aimed to examine effects of a shift in the cropping pattern towards more profitable products with lower water requirements on changes in water levels for this purpose in the smo model 0 4 a dp m e a n a dp 0 8 a dp m e a n was used to change the ca of barley alfalfa and cantaloupe and 0 8 a dp m e a n a dp 1 5 a dp m e a n was used to change the ca of onion corn and wheat respectively fig 4 a shows the profit from crops in each strategy and fig 4 b represents the total yield in each zone of each strategy the mean groundwater level variation in the entire study area in each strategy is shown in fig 4 c among the examined strategies the optimal cropping pattern strategy based on current condition not only leads to the lowest groundwater exploitation but also to the lowest profit for farmers because the less water allocation results in lower yield and reduces the farmers income in this strategy according to results of the smo model the game theory was used to assess the decision making process of farmers and government in each combination of strategies 4 3 results of the non cooperative decision making the rational decision making process of farmers and government was examined through defining three types of game the cropping pattern shift game the efficiency improvement game and the linked game 4 3 1 game 1 cropping pattern shift in this game it was assumed that the government can adopt one of three strategies namely pessimistic p semi optimistic so and optimistic o and farmers can choose one of three income strategies namely low profitable lp semi profitable sp and high profitable hp table 3 presents the definition of each strategy fig 5 shows the matrix form of cropping pattern shift game in this game there are 9 combinations of choices for stakeholders the payoff of each choice for the government and farmers were determined by smo model the payoff of farmers is a function of ca in each zone as follow payoff for farmers 0 15 profit of zone 1 0 6 profit of zone 2 0 25 profit of zone 3 the basic hypothesis of this game is the ability of the government to enforce limitations on the farmers exploitation in line with the basic assumptions of the game theory this game assumes that the players are rational and fully aware of their own payoff and that of their opponents in each combination of strategies in table 4 nash gmr smr and seq solution concepts are investigated to determine the stakeholders behavior according to results the state o hp is the solution that is revealed through nash gmr smr and seq stabilities the state o hp represents the scenario where farmers choose to change the cropping pattern and the government adopts an optimistic strategy this means that the government allows farmers to extract groundwater 71 mcm per year and farmers change their cropping patterns to make the highest profit under new condition which is 10 260 000 this raises the question as to whether this state provides a stable realistic solution to answer this question three considerations need to be taken 1 in the strategy of cropping pattern shift farmers have to reduce the ca of products such as barley and alfalfa however farmers who know based on experience that there is a market demand for these products will resist taking the risk of cultivating other product that may not have the same demand 2 historical data of the study area indicates that farmers tend to withdraw more water than the allowed amounts hence there is a strong possibility of violation of limits by farmers 3 enforcement of groundwater extraction limitations is difficult by the government as the farmers resistance may transform the issue into a social political problem farmers will have more tendency to accept some restrictions if the government somehow ensures that they make more profit by doing so and thus reduce the possibility of conflict and resistance therefore next game was designed to investigate the possible outcomes of this approach 4 3 2 game 2 efficiency improvement the objective of this game was first to examine the farmers and government decision making procedure in an improvement in the irrigation efficiency and then to link it with the cropping pattern shift game in order to encourage farmers economically to change the cropping pattern and follow extraction limitations this game makes the following basic assumptions irrigation efficiency is 55 and the new ca of each product cannot be lower than 0 8 or higher than 1 2 times the mean ca in the present conditions the government cannot limit the groundwater exploitation contrary to the cropping pattern shift game as the irrigation efficiency increases the recharge from irrigation decreases this effect was applied in the simulation model the government has two alternatives in this game either to invest in the efficiency improvement pay or continue the current state don t pay farmers also have two alternatives either to accept the optimal cropping pattern of efficiency improvement condition accept or refuse it don t accept table 5 presents definitions and features of each state in this game fig 6 shows a strategic diagram of the efficiency improvement game table 6 also indicates obtained results from examining different types of stables between players the state don t pay accept represents the scenario in which the government does not take any action but farmers still choose the optimal cropping pattern since farmers have no desire to change their cropping patterns without any government support this scenario will not come to the reality on the other hand the state pay accept is a stable solution in all stability definitions except for nash this state represents the cooperative decision making between government and farmers in this state because of low foresight of nash it is not recognized as a stable solution according to results of smo model the groundwater exploitation of these states will amount to 66 5 mmc considering issues of the stable solution of the cropping pattern shift game in the third game the two previous games were linked together 4 3 3 linked game this game represents the scenario in which the government attempts to increase the farmers profits by increasing the efficiency in exchange for their cooperation in implementing better cropping patterns and their adherence to water exploitation restrictions farmers have four alternatives in this game two alternatives involve implementing optimal cropping patterns or shifting the cropping pattern based on existing conditions identical to alternatives in the cropping pattern shift game and the same alternatives have an efficiency improvement incentive in place table 7 shows descriptions and characteristics of each state in this game table 8 also indicates the net income in each zone of the study area for each state of linked game using smo model the ca values of each product in every zone and the whole study area of the linked game were calculated and presented in table 9 as shown in table 9 some combinations naturally result in the same ca values for instance ca values are similar in combinations 1 4 7 and 16 because farmers have decided to continue with the same cropping pattern the payoffs of both beneficiaries were determined in fig 7 after calculating the farmers profit water exploitation and water level drawdown for each combination of this game the states which are marked with red are the same sates in the cropping pattern shift game as shown in table 10 the state pay hp ie is the only identified state in all stabilities definitions as the stable solution representing the scenario where farmers choose to use profitable cropping patterns cropping pattern shift while the government not only enforces the strictest limitation on water exploitation 65 5 mcm but also pays the costs of irrigation efficiency improvement in this state the government pays the costs of irrigation efficiency improvement as a financial incentive for farmers to choose better cropping patterns despite the fact that this solution assumes that the government can enforce water exploitation restrictions the incentive based relationship of farmers with the government is likely to limit the farmers violations of restrictions in this scenario linking two previous games showed that the state pay hp ie will resolve the problem of the cropping pattern shift game and encourage farmers to interact with the government table 11 presents features of this state for beneficiaries this stable solution reduces the amount of water withdrawn from the groundwater resource by 18 5 mcm year compared to the existing condition fig 8 shows changes in groundwater levels in the case that farmers and government agree to implement this solution as shown the groundwater level at the end of the fifth year of this scenario is 2 m higher than in the scenario where beneficiaries choose to maintain the status quo i e the combination p don t pay lp nie in the state pay hp ie although the government has to pay the costs of irrigation efficiency improvement in the study area this encourages farmers to accept optimal cropping patterns and respect the water extraction restrictions linking two previous games provides the missing incentive and creates reciprocal relationship of beneficiaries furthermore this particular state was identified as the stable solution in all stability definitions of the linked game this means that all beneficiaries choose this state regardless of their foresight attitude about the opponent optimistic or pessimistic and knowledge about preferences this signifies the higher probability of realization of this scenario if players choose to behave in a non cooperative manner 5 conclusion managing groundwater resources as a common pool resource encounters with various conflicts and diverging objectives because social political and economic factors can cause beneficiaries to behave non cooperatively to maximize their individual profit therefore in this study the game theory was applied to examine the non cooperative decision making procedures of stakeholders involved with the use and regulation of groundwater quantity and quality simulations and an optimization model were used to calculate the payoffs of beneficiaries called farmers and government in each game the non cooperative behavior was first simulated based on current policies in the study area crop pattern game while the farmers non violation of restrictive laws is the basic assumption in modeling this game the excessive groundwater is extracted by farmers in the study area in this game s stable state it is induced that more restrictions on the excessive groundwater exploitation and cropping patterns changes should be considered in the study area given the fact that farmers may violate the proposed crop pattern without the existence of economic incentives the next game efficiency improvement was modeled in this game it is assumed that the government covers the costs of irrigation efficiency improvement completely finally the third game was modeled by linking two previous games in order to create interaction among beneficiaries in this game the stable state represents the scenario in which farmers decide to change the cropping patterns and the government enforces more limitations on water withdrawals 65 5 mcm while covers costs of irrigation efficiency improvement in this state despite the fact that the government limits the farmers groundwater extractions and pays the whole efficiency improvement costs the possibility of farmers violation reduces due to the reciprocal relationship between beneficiaries according to the proposed methodology an interactive relationship is established by considering conflicts diverging objectives and non cooperative behaviors of beneficiaries that leads to maintain groundwater resources and increase the users benefits in this study only farmers are considered as groundwater users while other beneficiaries such as industrials and environmental water rights can be involved it is recommended to model the inter sectional interactions between groundwater users and intra sectoral interactions of each agent e g among farmers as well furthermore it is suggested to consider relationships between farmers by cooperative games or agent based models in future studies declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgement this study was supported by researcher

6159,groundwater resource exploitations as one of the most valuable water resources cause conflicts among beneficiaries due to different priorities in decision making processes these conflicts lead beneficiaries to decide non cooperatively consequently it is essential to consider non cooperative decision making in order to manage groundwater resources properly in this study non cooperative game theory was applied to groundwater resource management this methodology was employed in bad khaledabad study area located in the center of iran also quantity and quality simulation and optimization models were used to calculate the payoffs of beneficiaries including farmers and government in order to understand beneficiaries non cooperative decision making three games were examined called cropping pattern shift efficiency improvement and linked game the stable solution obtained for the linked game was the scenario where farmers choose to change their cropping patterns which will increase the farmers profit by up to us 3 280 000 and government limits groundwater withdrawals to 66 5 mcm and pays for efficiency improvements which will raise the groundwater table 2m at the end of the fifth year keywords groundwater management non cooperative game theory modflow mt3dms multi objectives optimization 1 introduction resources and goods can be classified into four groups private public toll and common pool based on their subtractability and excludability according to this classification common pool resources are characterized by high subtractability and difficult exclusion one of which is groundwater resource ostrom et al 1994 due to the fact that groundwater exploitation and regulation are shared by numerous stakeholders with conflicts of interests the groundwater resources management is very complicated and costly in common pool resources management in order to investigate the beneficiaries conflicts of interest and assessing the impact of their behavior on the outcome conflict resolution theories can be applied game theory is one of the most commonly used theories and a framework for making an informed managerial decision by means of studying the behavior of the involved stakeholders myerson 2013 game theory provides a more realistic insight into how the stakeholders called player respond to each other s actions in the application of game theory it is assumed that each stakeholder tries to maximize his own gain called payoff yet knowing the actions of other players also affects this gain madani 2010 groundwater resources management institutions as common pools can be classified in three types exogenous regulatory institutions as well as cooperative and non cooperative management madani and dinar 2011 in general cooperative management has gained greater interest in groundwater resources management because of its resemblance to optimization approach loáiciga 2004 madani and dinar 2012a raquel et al 2007 in the optimization based methods the problem is often transformed into a single strategy and single decision maker which reveals a number of shortcomings a series of recent studies has focused on the application of simulation methods optimization approaches and cooperative institutions in groundwater resources management simultaneously alizadeh et al 2017 bazargan lari et al 2009 farhadi et al 2016 lópez corona et al 2013 parsapour moghaddam et al 2015 in cooperative management institutions all stakeholders collaborate to yield the best global utility nevertheless stakeholders preferences are maximizing their individual objectives which leads to behave non cooperatively madani and hipel 2011 therefore non cooperative institutions can be applied to achieve better effectiveness by introducing more realism into the modeling of stakeholders decision making processes limited number of prior studies were found on the application of non cooperative concepts in water resources management fang et al 1993 madani and dinar 2012b madani and hipel 2007 mahjouri and ardestani 2011 in the application of non cooperative institutions two challenging issues should be considered i the need to reconcile the conflicting interests of many beneficiaries and ii the existence of externalities which may affect groundwater level to address the first challenge it is essential to define groundwater beneficiaries and their objectives groundwater stakeholders can be divided into two categories groundwater users and groundwater regulators therefore conflicts among beneficiaries may exist intra sectoral e g among farmers or inter sectoral e g between farmers and the government in this study in order to focus on the first challenging issue conflict of interests between two main stakeholders namely the government and farmers inter sectoral conflicts are considered the basic premise of this study is that farmers are assumed to have a cooperative intra sectoral behavior have a unified front the withdrawal from wells which leads to the groundwater levels decline may be considered as externalities madani and dinar 2012b in this study all farmers are represented by a single stakeholder that protects their preferences in the interaction with the government the variables including well withdrawal by farmers groundwater level fluctuations and the farmers cultivation profits as determinants of the stakeholders decision making procedures are estimated utilizing a linked simulation optimization model accordingly the main objectives of this study are as follows examining the decision making processes between farmers and the government who are unwilling to cooperate assessing impacts of their foresight on decision making processes and investigating the possibility of reaching a cooperative solution in the absence of farmers and government cooperation behavior in the following sections the research method is elaborated including an introduction to modflow and mt3d simulation models the optimization model structure and non cooperative stability definitions then the study area is presented for implementation of the proposed method finally the results of models are presented 2 methodology as shown in fig 1 the research methodology can be divided into three main sections groundwater quantity and quality simulation simulation optimization model and examination of farmers and government non cooperative decision making process according to the fig 1 two objectives of farmers and government are simultaneously optimized the optimal results of this section will be obtained based on the assumption that stakeholders cooperatively participate to gain system s objectives 2 1 groundwater quantity and quality simulation in the present study modflow groundwater

consider the aquifer as an integrated body it can also simulate different water containing layers as confined unconfined or a combination of both in this model it is also possible to simulate the areal recharge evapotranspiration flow to wells flow to drains and flow through riverbeds mt3d model which is developed by zheng 1990 under the supervision of the us environmental protection agency usepa is a common model for simulating the transport of solute in groundwater mt3d is a three dimensional modular that is capable of simulating the advection dispersion and chemical reactions of

confined and semi confined aquifers and model the transport of solutes under different recharge and drain conditions 2 2 groundwater optimization model in this study in order to assess the interaction between main groundwater stakeholders including groundwater users and regulators farmers and government are considered with opposed objectives and preferences the optimization model consists of two objectives i farmer s objective that refers to maximizing farmers total profit during the modeling period eq 3 and ii government objective which is minimizing the mean groundwater level drawdown eq 4 decision variables of this model include the monthly allocation of groundwater to each product and the cultivated area ca of each product during the optimization period 3 max z 1 d 1 d b d c d 4 min z

products on the crop yield eq 6 the higher the ec value the less water will be available for products and since the water availability directly affects the yield the higher water salinity reduces the yield of products table 1 presents assumptions of this study according to the impact of water salinity on the yield of products bauder et al 2011 the constraints of the optimization model are as follow 9 p 1 p a pd m a x a d where maxad refers to the total ca in zone d ha eq 10 represents the total water withdrawn from zone d in month m of year t m3 10 g dtm p 1 p v g dpmt a dp 11 e c dtm e c

the maximum ca and minimum ca in each zone are calculated as follow 12 a dp min a dp a dp max where adp min represents the minimum ca of product p in zone d ha and adp max is the maximum ca of this product in the same zone in this study pareto solutions are obtained using a nsgaii based meta heuristic genetic algorithm detailed information about this algorithm is provided in srinivas and deb 1994 studies moreover complex proportional assessment copras is used to select among the obtained pareto points in the previous steps in which a weight of 0 5 is assigned to both objectives the present study used the copras method because it is a multi factorial decision making method with simplicity of calculation low calculation time ranking total pareto points simultaneous use of quantitative and qualitative criteria ability to separately calculate positive criteria maximum and negative criteria minimum in the evaluation process ability to estimate the degree of importance of each option as percentages in order to indicate better or worse size of an option and the ability to adapt to local and empirical conditions further information about the copras method can be found in a research by zavadskas and kaklauskas 1996 2 3 application of non cooperative stability in the context of the application of game theory in groundwater resource management firstly it is necessary to define the main concepts according to the problem of interest one of the main components of every game is the players here players are the two stakeholders of the groundwater exploitation management issue namely the farmers and the government although each of these stakeholders consists of multiple components with their own intra sectoral interactions this study only considers the decisions of each stakeholder as a whole and ignores the intra sectoral interactions the other main components of the game are options or strategies in this study each player s available strategies are determined by scenario building in a simulation optimization model the payoff of players for each available scenario is calculated utilizing a simulation model in modflow and mt3dms followed by a two objective optimization model the payoffs of farmers and the government for each scenario are respectively the profit value given by eq 3 and the groundwater level variation given by eq 4 the stable solution of a non cooperative game can be determined by several ways namely nash general meta rationality gmr symmetric meta rationality smr and sequential stability seq types of stability can be categorized based on three criteria i foresight ii willingness to disimprovement and iii knowledge about preferences fang et al 1989 selbirak 1994 in this study the behavior of farmers and the government are examined by the use of non cooperative stabilities nash stability indicates decision making process based on the assumption that each decision maker is only aware of his own priorities also both farmers and the government have a limited foresight meaning that they can only anticipate one response of the other player to their own decisions in the nash solution concept it is assumed that farmers are only interested in increasing their profit and the government only seeks to reduce the groundwater drawdown which indicates both players are risk averse the disadvantage of nash stability is the limited foresight which means farmers and the government will choose the option with the best apparent payoff without considering the other stakeholder counter move since farmers and the government make decisions based on their past experiences and can predict the opponent counter moves other types of stabilities should be considered to avoid the shortcoming of the nash concept gmr is a stability concept which is only applicable to the games where players perform at least two moves madani and hipel 2011 in the gmr concept each player can anticipate the opponent counter move and makes a decision accordingly while farmers and the government s knowledge and past experiences allow them to anticipate the opponent s reactions gmr can be a proper choice for modeling stakeholders behavior the gmr stability solution indicates that farmers will choose the strategy that guarantees their payoff would not be declined by the government response the same also applies to the government seq stability takes a similar approach to the game as gmr but assumes that players are not interested in reducing the opponent s payoff accordingly unlike in gmr farmers are optimistic in assessing the government s response and believe that the government is seeking to reduce drawdown not the cultivation profits this stability perfectly reflects the circumstances of the studied case as the government has consistently proven its intention to reduce the groundwater drawdown with a minimum financial losses for farmers the last considered stability is smr which is similar to gmr with the difference that farmers and the government both have greater foresight and can anticipate three future moves and counter moves in this study the smr concept is applied to assess effects of stakeholders high foresights on their behaviors decision making procedures and the eventual outcomes in the following sections different games between farmers and the government are defined based on the study area characteristics then the matrix form of each game is constructed based on the modeling results and relevant game definitions finally in each game the defined non cooperative stabilities are considered to investigate the stakeholders behavior in responding to each game features in this study different non cooperative solution concepts are applied to assess the effects of foresights risk averseness and knowledge of stakeholders on the process of decision making 3 study area to study the performance and efficiency of this methodology it is tested for bad khaledabad region located in siahkouh basin in isfahan and yazd provinces in center of iran bad khaledabad sub basin has an area of 1851 4 km2 and is located in the northwest of the catchment between 51 20 and 52 20 longitudes and 33 20 and 36 00 latitudes according to collected data this region has 173 wells 9 qanats and a spring with a total annual discharge of 86 86 mcm of which 79 2 mcm is from wells the location of the study area in iran and the location of groundwater exploitation points are displayed in fig 2 the study area is divided into three zones based on changes in the groundwater level table during 1996 2016 zone 1 with increasing water levels in recent years zone 2 in the middle area with the highest cultivation density and the largest decline in water level during the 5 year period of simulation and zone 3 with a continues water fluctuation moreover the optimal water allocation is done monthly for a 5 year period in each zone six ca variables which represent dominant crops namely barley alfalfa wheat corn onions and cantaloupe are considered in each zone hence there are a total of 5 12 6 3 18 1098 decision variables in the optimization model in the presented methodology the groundwater pumping costs is applied to the farmers profit as a costs factor which also may serve the government s objective minimizing the drawdown however farmers of the study area pay such a low price for electricity that they may not actually feel effects of drawdown on the groundwater exploitation expenses the objective function is based on achieving a more realistic estimate of the cultivation costs generally the presence of costs in the objective function brings it closer to the reality of the existing situation 4 results in this study there are general assumptions as follows 1 there are only two beneficiaries government and farmers who have opposite objectives of minimizing the groundwater extraction and maximizing the economic benefit 2 salinity is considered as a qualitative parameter whose impact on the crop yield is considered 3 no game is defined among farmers and intra sectoral interactions are not investigated in the following sections the results of groundwater quantity and quality simulation model are presented then the results of linked simulation and optimization model and developed scenarios are expressed in the third part the results of three game model including cropping pattern shift efficiency improvement and linked games are explained 4 1 results of groundwater quantity and quality simulation groundwater flow modeling was performed in the groundwater modeling system gms software first a conceptual model was built by introducing the position and specification of the study area and then the entire aquifer area was divided into a 1000 1000 grid the groundwater simulation model of bad khaledabad region was calibrated in two steps 1 using the steady flow for the period of 22 june 2011 to 22 september 2011 and 2 using the transient flow for the period of 22 september 2011 to 22 september 2013 in 24 monthly steps table 2 shows the maximum error mean error and root mean square error rmse of modflow and mt3dms results for the calibration and validation period the listed low error values in this table indicate the reasonable accuracy of the groundwater flow simulation model the predicted and observed water levels of nine observation wells in the study area during the validation period are illustrated in fig 3 a in this study salinity is considered as a qualitative parameter because based on the available information in the study area it is examined that while other quality parameters such as phosphate and nitrate have not exceeded the standard values salinity is at the standard threshold and can reduce the crop yield accordingly salinity effects are applied in the optimization model both in the constraint and the crop yield function the simulation of groundwater salinity was performed by the help of electrical conductivity ec parameter since this parameter is not defined in mt3dms tds 0 665ec was used to convert the electrical conductivity ec to total dissolved solids tds as in the mt3dms model the error of groundwater quality simulation also indicated the reasonable accuracy of water salinity modeling in the study area fig 3 b shows predicted and observed tds values for nine observation wells in the study area during the validation period 4 2 simulation multi objective optimization model the simulation multi objectives optimization model smo operates in the following steps specifying the optimization constraints running the optimization model in order to determine the amounts of groundwater allocated to farmers importing the obtained groundwater exploitation values into the simulation model modflow and mt3dms in order to determine water and salinity levels in the study area exporting the obtained water and salinity levels back to the optimization model and calculating the second objective minimizing water level drawdown and repeating the steps above until fulfilling the termination condition the smo model was implemented in the following three strategies in order to examine how beneficiaries government and farmers choose possible strategies 1 continuation of current condition the ca of each product was considered equal to the mean ca in a 5 year historical period and the water level variation was considered to be identical to modflow simulation 2 optimal cropping pattern based on the current condition the smo model was run according to the equations 3 12 to calculate changes in the ca of six products in three zones it aimed to determine the appropriate cropping pattern that could be achieved in the current condition in eq 12 adp min 0 8 adp mean and adp max 1 2 adp mean where adp mean is equal to mean area of crop p in zone d during 1996 2016 3 cropping pattern shift the ca was reallocated from water intensive and less profitable products to more profitable products with relatively lower water requirement this strategy aimed to examine effects of a shift in the cropping pattern towards more profitable products with lower water requirements on changes in water levels for this purpose in the smo model 0 4 a dp m e a n a dp 0 8 a dp m e a n was used to change the ca of barley alfalfa and cantaloupe and 0 8 a dp m e a n a dp 1 5 a dp m e a n was used to change the ca of onion corn and wheat respectively fig 4 a shows the profit from crops in each strategy and fig 4 b represents the total yield in each zone of each strategy the mean groundwater level variation in the entire study area in each strategy is shown in fig 4 c among the examined strategies the optimal cropping pattern strategy based on current condition not only leads to the lowest groundwater exploitation but also to the lowest profit for farmers because the less water allocation results in lower yield and reduces the farmers income in this strategy according to results of the smo model the game theory was used to assess the decision making process of farmers and government in each combination of strategies 4 3 results of the non cooperative decision making the rational decision making process of farmers and government was examined through defining three types of game the cropping pattern shift game the efficiency improvement game and the linked game 4 3 1 game 1 cropping pattern shift in this game it was assumed that the government can adopt one of three strategies namely pessimistic p semi optimistic so and optimistic o and farmers can choose one of three income strategies namely low profitable lp semi profitable sp and high profitable hp table 3 presents the definition of each strategy fig 5 shows the matrix form of cropping pattern shift game in this game there are 9 combinations of choices for stakeholders the payoff of each choice for the government and farmers were determined by smo model the payoff of farmers is a function of ca in each zone as follow payoff for farmers 0 15 profit of zone 1 0 6 profit of zone 2 0 25 profit of zone 3 the basic hypothesis of this game is the ability of the government to enforce limitations on the farmers exploitation in line with the basic assumptions of the game theory this game assumes that the players are rational and fully aware of their own payoff and that of their opponents in each combination of strategies in table 4 nash gmr smr and seq solution concepts are investigated to determine the stakeholders behavior according to results the state o hp is the solution that is revealed through nash gmr smr and seq stabilities the state o hp represents the scenario where farmers choose to change the cropping pattern and the government adopts an optimistic strategy this means that the government allows farmers to extract groundwater 71 mcm per year and farmers change their cropping patterns to make the highest profit under new condition which is 10 260 000 this raises the question as to whether this state provides a stable realistic solution to answer this question three considerations need to be taken 1 in the strategy of cropping pattern shift farmers have to reduce the ca of products such as barley and alfalfa however farmers who know based on experience that there is a market demand for these products will resist taking the risk of cultivating other product that may not have the same demand 2 historical data of the study area indicates that farmers tend to withdraw more water than the allowed amounts hence there is a strong possibility of violation of limits by farmers 3 enforcement of groundwater extraction limitations is difficult by the government as the farmers resistance may transform the issue into a social political problem farmers will have more tendency to accept some restrictions if the government somehow ensures that they make more profit by doing so and thus reduce the possibility of conflict and resistance therefore next game was designed to investigate the possible outcomes of this approach 4 3 2 game 2 efficiency improvement the objective of this game was first to examine the farmers and government decision making procedure in an improvement in the irrigation efficiency and then to link it with the cropping pattern shift game in order to encourage farmers economically to change the cropping pattern and follow extraction limitations this game makes the following basic assumptions irrigation efficiency is 55 and the new ca of each product cannot be lower than 0 8 or higher than 1 2 times the mean ca in the present conditions the government cannot limit the groundwater exploitation contrary to the cropping pattern shift game as the irrigation efficiency increases the recharge from irrigation decreases this effect was applied in the simulation model the government has two alternatives in this game either to invest in the efficiency improvement pay or continue the current state don t pay farmers also have two alternatives either to accept the optimal cropping pattern of efficiency improvement condition accept or refuse it don t accept table 5 presents definitions and features of each state in this game fig 6 shows a strategic diagram of the efficiency improvement game table 6 also indicates obtained results from examining different types of stables between players the state don t pay accept represents the scenario in which the government does not take any action but farmers still choose the optimal cropping pattern since farmers have no desire to change their cropping patterns without any government support this scenario will not come to the reality on the other hand the state pay accept is a stable solution in all stability definitions except for nash this state represents the cooperative decision making between government and farmers in this state because of low foresight of nash it is not recognized as a stable solution according to results of smo model the groundwater exploitation of these states will amount to 66 5 mmc considering issues of the stable solution of the cropping pattern shift game in the third game the two previous games were linked together 4 3 3 linked game this game represents the scenario in which the government attempts to increase the farmers profits by increasing the efficiency in exchange for their cooperation in implementing better cropping patterns and their adherence to water exploitation restrictions farmers have four alternatives in this game two alternatives involve implementing optimal cropping patterns or shifting the cropping pattern based on existing conditions identical to alternatives in the cropping pattern shift game and the same alternatives have an efficiency improvement incentive in place table 7 shows descriptions and characteristics of each state in this game table 8 also indicates the net income in each zone of the study area for each state of linked game using smo model the ca values of each product in every zone and the whole study area of the linked game were calculated and presented in table 9 as shown in table 9 some combinations naturally result in the same ca values for instance ca values are similar in combinations 1 4 7 and 16 because farmers have decided to continue with the same cropping pattern the payoffs of both beneficiaries were determined in fig 7 after calculating the farmers profit water exploitation and water level drawdown for each combination of this game the states which are marked with red are the same sates in the cropping pattern shift game as shown in table 10 the state pay hp ie is the only identified state in all stabilities definitions as the stable solution representing the scenario where farmers choose to use profitable cropping patterns cropping pattern shift while the government not only enforces the strictest limitation on water exploitation 65 5 mcm but also pays the costs of irrigation efficiency improvement in this state the government pays the costs of irrigation efficiency improvement as a financial incentive for farmers to choose better cropping patterns despite the fact that this solution assumes that the government can enforce water exploitation restrictions the incentive based relationship of farmers with the government is likely to limit the farmers violations of restrictions in this scenario linking two previous games showed that the state pay hp ie will resolve the problem of the cropping pattern shift game and encourage farmers to interact with the government table 11 presents features of this state for beneficiaries this stable solution reduces the amount of water withdrawn from the groundwater resource by 18 5 mcm year compared to the existing condition fig 8 shows changes in groundwater levels in the case that farmers and government agree to implement this solution as shown the groundwater level at the end of the fifth year of this scenario is 2 m higher than in the scenario where beneficiaries choose to maintain the status quo i e the combination p don t pay lp nie in the state pay hp ie although the government has to pay the costs of irrigation efficiency improvement in the study area this encourages farmers to accept optimal cropping patterns and respect the water extraction restrictions linking two previous games provides the missing incentive and creates reciprocal relationship of beneficiaries furthermore this particular state was identified as the stable solution in all stability definitions of the linked game this means that all beneficiaries choose this state regardless of their foresight attitude about the opponent optimistic or pessimistic and knowledge about preferences this signifies the higher probability of realization of this scenario if players choose to behave in a non cooperative manner 5 conclusion managing groundwater resources as a common pool resource encounters with various conflicts and diverging objectives because social political and economic factors can cause beneficiaries to behave non cooperatively to maximize their individual profit therefore in this study the game theory was applied to examine the non cooperative decision making procedures of stakeholders involved with the use and regulation of groundwater quantity and quality simulations and an optimization model were used to calculate the payoffs of beneficiaries called farmers and government in each game the non cooperative behavior was first simulated based on current policies in the study area crop pattern game while the farmers non violation of restrictive laws is the basic assumption in modeling this game the excessive groundwater is extracted by farmers in the study area in this game s stable state it is induced that more restrictions on the excessive groundwater exploitation and cropping patterns changes should be considered in the study area given the fact that farmers may violate the proposed crop pattern without the existence of economic incentives the next game efficiency improvement was modeled in this game it is assumed that the government covers the costs of irrigation efficiency improvement completely finally the third game was modeled by linking two previous games in order to create interaction among beneficiaries in this game the stable state represents the scenario in which farmers decide to change the cropping patterns and the government enforces more limitations on water withdrawals 65 5 mcm while covers costs of irrigation efficiency improvement in this state despite the fact that the government limits the farmers groundwater extractions and pays the whole efficiency improvement costs the possibility of farmers violation reduces due to the reciprocal relationship between beneficiaries according to the proposed methodology an interactive relationship is established by considering conflicts diverging objectives and non cooperative behaviors of beneficiaries that leads to maintain groundwater resources and increase the users benefits in this study only farmers are considered as groundwater users while other beneficiaries such as industrials and environmental water rights can be involved it is recommended to model the inter sectional interactions between groundwater users and intra sectoral interactions of each agent e g among farmers as well furthermore it is suggested to consider relationships between farmers by cooperative games or agent based models in future studies declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgement this study was supported by researcher
