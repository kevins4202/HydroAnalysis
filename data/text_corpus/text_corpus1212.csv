assessed using river discharge data modis and gleam et data and ground as well as satellite inundation extents in the kalu wet and mundeni dry river basins in sri lanka the model was well calibrated and validated nash 0 9 and confirmed to be highly capable of reproducing the long term 20 years observed river discharges nash 0 89 and hydrological flow regime properties for both basins particularly the simulated low flow just before the flood and the peak discharges during the flood as well as their timings coincided well with the observed discharges in both basins which indicates that the model is capable of reproducing soil and vegetation water storages reasonably well and therefore it can be used for real time and forecasting applications with the re starting capability the model simulated

discharges evapotranspiration inundation 1 introduction water is an integral part of life on the earth and thus its cycle is an extremely important process for the existence of all living organisms on the planet throughout the human history the societies have been severely affected by hydro meteorological extremes and thus there have been tremendous efforts to understand assess and predict the water cycle and its impacts on the climate system in recent years fatalities and economic damages caused by storms floods and droughts have significantly increased in the world due to global warming and accelerated population growth winsemius 2015 unisdr 2018 global warming plays an increasingly important role in driving up climate and hydrological extremes by accelerating the water cycle modifying the seasonal patterns and thus threatening to the security of water resources and sustainable development huntington 2006 oki and kanae 2006 hirabayashi et al 2013 ipcc climate change 2014 at the same time ever increasing population growth places additional pressures on the availability of water resources for food water energy consumption and effective measures for disaster risk mitigation and adaptation therefore decision makers crucially require reliable information on water resources as well as water related disasters to quantify hydrological risk i e the combination of hazard vulnerability and exposure for efficient management of resources and effective strategies for adaptation and mitigation hydrological models which are used for understanding various watershed hydrological processes and predicting watershed behaviours have become essential tools for generating information on water resources and water related disasters to support decision making strategies chow et al 1988 over the years hydrological modelling has evolved from simple concepts to very complex physically meaningful and distributed approaches todini 2007 singh 2018 pioneering achievements in hydrological modelling has taken place mainly due to increasing availability of spatially distributed ground and satellite data improved understanding of hydrological processes advancements in computer resources that have boosted the development of several distributed hydrological models dhms and the integration of various physical processes and techniques abbott et al 1986 bathurst et al 1995 yang et al 2000 2004 arnold et al 1998 de roo et al 2000 wang et al 2009a yamazaki et al 2014 particularly due to ever increasing flood disasters and devastating flood damage globally which are more frequently reported than those caused by any other type of natural disasters freer et al 2011 dhms which integrated the capabilities of simulating catchment scale rainfall runoff inundation processes e g mike she refsgaard and storm 1995 lisflood van der knijff et al 2010 and rainfall runoff inundation rri sayama et al 2012 are considered to be very informative and effective tools for developing a proactive flood early warning system and mapping flood hazards to provide crucial flood related information for flood risk management and damage assessment these types of models are capable of providing additional information e g inundation extents flooding depths and most importantly the direction of flow paths as the flood water travels compared to typical i e kinematic wave dhms in which water flows along the defined flow directions bates and de roo 2000 horritt and bates 2001 wilson et al 2007 hunter et al 2007 bates et al 2010 sayama et al 2012 however runoff inundation type models or flood depth and inundation estimations mainly consider the conservation of water balance at a catchment scale model related uncertainty arises mainly due to negligence of several fundamental and critical water energy related parameters and physical processes e g soil moisture canopy interception evapotranspiration et and soil vegetation atmosphere interactions which cannot be overlooked even for flood related applications particularly in arid and semi arid regions for example the amount of moisture within the soil layers controls the surface runoff and infiltration ratio whereas the accurate estimation of the soil vegetation et component of the water budget is crucial for simulating accurate soil vegetation water storages river discharges and flood depths the negligence of essential physical formulations for water and energy budget components and land vegetation atmosphere interactions within rainfall runoff inundation modelling will result in several critical issues in applying these types of models for scientific and operational flood related applications under changing climate one of those critical issues is that uncertainties in the initial soil and vegetation water storages will impact the reliability of simulated flood related parameters and associated flood related risk assessments for past events and therefore additional efforts and time are required for repeated model calibrations for each flood event to obtain reasonable model simulated outputs another issue is that when applying the model to operational flood monitoring and forecasting activities unreliable initial storages will introduce larger uncertainties in the timing of simulated flood onset peak discharges and inundation depths and therefore its output needs to be handled with great caution third as the severity of drought and flooding conditions are expected to increase in the future climate and the extreme climate sequences of dry wet periods are also expected to be modified madakumbura et al 2019 due to virtually certain global warming and an increasing rate of evapotranspiration the applicability of these models to the projected future climate will introduce additional uncertainties in flood related simulation and risk assessment fourth the use of the models beyond flood applications such as for drought assessment or integrated water resources management also becomes questionable as they do not estimate the impact of temperature and evapotranspiration on the water budget explicitly these issues have been recognized as major drawbacks for the applicability of water budget models to water resources management as well as to water related disaster management under changing climate sayama et al 2012 presented a water budget model i e the rainfall runoff inundation rri model for flood applications by employing two dimensional diffusion wave equations to simulate water depths in each orthogonal grid cell and hence integrate the processes of rainfall runoff and the propagation of flood inundation simultaneously the model has been applied to several event based flood simulations and inundation analyses sayama et al 2012 perera et al 2014 nastiti et al 2015 sayama et al 2015 yoshimoto and amarnath 2017 sayama et al 2017 and flood damage assessment shrestha et al 2015 assuming the effect of evapotranspiration soil and vegetation interception stream aquifer interaction can be negligible during a flood event due to these assumptions and the omission of soil vegetation atmosphere interactions of catchment scale hydrological processes the present applications of the model are restricted only to past flood events on the other hand the physical basis of land surface models lsms for the representations of soil vegetation atmosphere interactions et soil moisture dynamics and the incorporation of space born distributed data for reliable vegetation phenology can overcome the issues found in typical water budget based dhms in the past several studies emphasized the importance of lsms in dhms and merged both models to integrate the characteristics of both lsms and flow routing models rigon et al 2006 wang et al 2009a particularly wang et al 2009c coupled a modified simple biosphere model version 2 sib2 model hydro sib2 with a semi distributed geomorphology based hydrological model gbhm a coupled model water and energy budget based distributed hydrological model web dhm has been verified extensively for the representation of physical processes and its applications such as simulation of hydrological responses and the energy budget wang et al 2009a surface temperature and heat budget analysis wang et al 2009b frozen soil processes wang et al 2010 drought analysis jaranilla sanchez et al 2011 snow hydrology shrestha et al 2012 and climate change impact assessment bhatti et al 2016 however this model is not applicable to simulating flood inundation processes in a watershed due to its semi distributed model structure and kinematic wave approximation for water flow estimation which completely omits inundation processes and thus may lead to the overestimation of river discharges in the downstream regions therefore the applicability of web dhm or similar web models which are based on kinematic wave formulations is limited to discharge estimation in the hill terrain of a watershed and cannot be used for flood inundation estimation damage analysis and flood risk analysis in a watershed accordingly this research presents the development of a new model the water and energy budget based rainfall runoff inundation web rri model by integrating previous studies by wang et al 2009a and sayama et al 2012 for integrated water resources management as well as water related disaster management particularly the hydro sib2 model was coupled with the rri model s 2 d flow equations to incorporate water and energy budget processes land vegetation atmosphere interactions multi layer soil moisture dynamics and 2 d lateral water flows to improve interception et infiltration processes runoff and inundation processes as the web rri model takes into account the entire natural hydrological processes of a catchment the model overcomes the limitations identified separately for web dhm and rri models and thus can be used for solving issues in integrated water resources management as well as water related disaster management under the variability of the water cycle as well as changing climate the new model has several merits it incorporates physical formulations for et fluxes soil and vegetation interception and soil moisture dynamics which will improve the accuracy of low flow estimation the timing of flood onset flood peak discharges and inundation depths and extents and then improve the reliability of flood and drought related risk assessment for past events as it takes more inputs e g radiation temperature humidity wind speed leaf area index in addition to precipitation the model will produce reliable responses to the water cycle variability as well as climate change scenarios and therefore it can be used for long term simulations such as reproducing past and projecting future climatology and hydrological extremes of a catchment with a great confidence moreover the model inputs are compatible with numerical weather and climate model outputs thus it can use those outputs directly to estimate basin scale hydrological responses to the model predicted forcing data finally owing to its complete representation of hydrological components of arid and semi arid regions the model can reproduce the actual conditions of hydrological parameters at each time step provided that input data are accurate enough and can be stopped at any time step and restarted from the previous history to reduce the computational burden of pre running of the model for the warming up period in practical applications such as flood forecasting and seasonal prediction this research paper is arranged as follows section 2 presents the overall structure major components and formulation of the web rri model the study area data and model setup are discussed in section 3 the simulation results are analysed and discussed in section 4 and the conclusions are given in section 5 2 model structure and processes this section describes the overall structure of the web rri model its formulations of physical processes including the vertical transfer of moisture and energy fluxes soil vegetation atmosphere interactions soil structure soil moisture dynamics lateral movements of water flow and interaction between vertical and horizontal water flows 2 1 the overall structure of the web rri model the overall web rri model structure fig 1 was divided into four major modules 1 the simple biosphere model 2 sib2 module for the vertical energy and water flux transfer between land and atmosphere for each model grid 2 the vertical soil moisture distribution module based on richard s equation and darcy s equations for groundwater recharge 3 the 2 d diffusive wave lateral flow module for surface flow and groundwater flow and 4 the 1 d diffusive wave river flow module the interactions between surface flow and river flow groundwater flow and soil moisture contents and groundwater flow and river discharge were also implemented in the web rri model the following sections briefly describe the model formulations and their processes 2 2 model formulations 2 2 1 sib2 module for vertical water and energy flux transfer between land and atmosphere this study used sib2 to simulate vertical energy and water fluxes and their transfer between land and atmosphere the sib2 model was developed by sellers et al 1996a b it uses a soil vegetation atmosphere transfer svat scheme in which heat and moisture fluxes originate from soil surface and vegetation canopy sib2 incorporates many significant changes from its original version including reduction of the number of model parameters incorporation of satellite remote sensing observation to describe surface vegetation conditions and its penology and replacement of empirical stomatal models with a photosynthesis conductance model as shown in fig 1 the original sib2 model was formulated to include three soil layers a surface soil layer d1 0 5 cm which acts as the source of direct evaporation when it is moist a root zone d2 5 20 cm which supplies the soil moisture to the vegetation roots and then for transpiration by leaves and a deep soil layer d3 which provides upward recharge of the root zone and source for hydrological base flow the complete formulation of interception evaporation infiltration vertical soil moisture transport plant transpiration and turbulent heat fluxes can be found in sellers et al 1996a the following section provides a brief summary of the governing equations the mass balance equation for the plant canopy interception is given by 1 m cw t p d d d c e ci ρ w the mass balance equation for the ground interception is given by 2 m gw t d d d c e gi ρ w where subscripts cw and gw denote canopy and ground water storage respectively m p d d and d c are the intercepted water m precipitation m s canopy through fall rate m s and canopy drainage rate m s respectively e ci and e gi are the evaporation rates of intercepted water kg m 2 s from canopy and ground ρ w is the density of water k g m 3 and t is time in seconds the maximum amount of canopy interception per unit area is defined by the leaf area index lai times 0 0001 m canopy temperature t c in kelvin is given by 3 c c t c t r nc h c λ e c ξ c ground surface temperature t g in kelvin is given by 4 c g t g t r ng h g λ e g ξ g 2 π c g t g t d τ d deep soil temperature t d in kelvin is given by 5 c d t d t 2 π c g t g t d τ d 365 π where subscripts c g and d represent canopy ground and deep soil respectively r n h λ e and ξ are the net radiation sensible heat flux latent heat flux energy transfer due to phase change in w m 2 respectively c is the effective heat capacity in j k g 1 k 1 and τ d 8400 s as similarly to sib2 the web rri also estimates et from the vegetation canopy and the soil surface the canopy et is based on the evaporation of intercepted water by the canopy and the vegetation transpiration which is extracted by the root system from the root zone soil water the surface evaporation is estimated from the direct evaporation of the surface layer soil moisture and puddled water held on the soil surface 2 2 2 vertical soil moisture distribution the representation of soil water movement in the original concept of the sib2 model is based on three zones layers i e surface soil layer root zone and deep soil layer and uses the finite difference method to solve the equation as shown in fig 1 in the web rri model the root and deep soil layers are divided into many sub soil layers to better represent the vertical water exchanges in the soil layers as described by wang et al 2009a the unsaturated zone vertical flow is given by the following water balance equations surface layer soil moisture w 1 is given by 6 w 1 t 1 θ s d 1 q 1 q 1 2 e g ρ w δ 1 root zone soil moisture w ri is given by 7 w ri t 1 θ s d i q i 1 i q i i 1 e ct i ρ w δ ri deep layer soil moisture w di is given by 8 w di t 1 θ s d i q i 1 i q i δ di where q 1 is the infiltration of water into the first soil layer m s q i 1 i is the water flow from the i 1 th layer to the i th layer e g is the ground surface evaporation rate from surface soil layer e ct i is the vegetation canopy transpiration rate through the stomata k g m 2 s in the i th layer of the root zone d i is the depth of the i th soil layer m θ s is the saturated volumetric water content m 3 m 3 ρ w is the density of water k g m 3 and δ is the flow added or subtracted due to the horizontal and vertical movement of ground water flow in the web rri model the depth of the total unsaturated soil layer changes with the fluctuation of the groundwater table at the beginning of each time step sib2 updates the ground interception and the surface wetness w 1 as an input to the sub layer soil model then the multi layer soil model estimates vertical interlayer water exchanges and soil moisture changes based on one dimensional richard s equation for unsteady and unsaturated flow in a porous medium for each sub layer at the end of all simulations at a particular time step the soil water contents in all three main soil layers are recalculated from updated soil moisture information which is stored in memory for the next model time step and passed to the sib2 module in the case of groundwater recharge estimation when the ground water level d g is below the soil depth d s the web rri model uses darcy s model for the gravitational vertical flow in this module no lateral water exchanges from the surface or subsurface are calculated 2 2 3 2 d diffusive wave lateral flow model for surface and groundwater flows surface or over land flow is formulated using the method employing the rri model presented by sayama et al 2012 in rri both surface and subsurface flows are combined together and the same algorithm is used to simulate lateral flow whereas in web rri surface flow is separated from subsurface flow by incorporating a multi layer soil model the effective overland storage of water after deducting for all losses interception et and infiltration is estimated in the sib2 module and the vertical soil moisture distribution added to the previous step water level at each grid cell and then passed to the 2 d diffusive wave module the water flow from and to each slope grid cell is calculated with a 2 d diffusive shallow water wave model derived from the continuity equation momentum equations for gradually varying unsteady flow conditions and manning s equation with the assumption that inertia terms can be neglected for the diffusive wave approximation the final equations for directional overland flows are derived as follows the equations for flow calculations in x and y directions are as follows 9 q x 1 n h 5 3 h x sgn h x 10 q y 1 n h 5 3 h y sgn h y the mass balance equation is spatially discretized for calculating changes in water level at each grid as follows 11 d h i j dt q x i 1 j q x i j δ x q y i j 1 q y i j δ y h e i j where q x and q y are the unit width discharges in x and y directions n is manning s roughness parameter h is the height of water from the surface h is the height of water from the datum sgn is the signum function q x i j and q y i j are the discharges in x and y directions from a grid cell at a location i j and h e i j is the effective overland storage of water m due to rainfall after accounting all the sinks interception et and infiltration and sources e g upward movement of ground water flow at a grid cell location i j lateral groundwater flow for an unconfined and infinite aquifer is formulated as follows 12 q gx k g f g e f g d g h g x 13 q gy k g f g e f g d g h g y where q gx and q gy are the unit width discharges in x and y directions h g is the height of ground water from the datum msl d g is the depth to the ground water table from the ground level f g is a parameter controlling the vertical exponential decay in the saturated hydraulic conductivity and k g is the saturated conductivity of the groundwater layer the mass balance equation for calculating changes in groundwater level at each grid is defined as 14 d h g i j dt q gx i 1 j q gx i j δ x q gy i j 1 q gy i j δ y to solve the above mentioned equations the fifth order runge kutta approximation with adaptive time step control is applied to both surface flow and groundwater flow calculations in the web rri model the lateral flow within the unsaturated soil layer is not estimated due to a high degree of complexity 2 2 4 1 d diffusive wave river routing module similar to rri the web rri model also treats slopes and river channels at each grid cell separately a river channel in the web rri model is discretized as a single channel along the centreline of the slope grid cell when the model detects a river channel based on flow accumulation information it considers that both slope and river channel are positioned within the same grid cell as described earlier the water flow on the slope is estimated using 2d diffusive wave equations on the other hand the river flow river routing is estimated using a 1d diffusive wave equation which is the same equation as eq 9 and q y was set it to zero to get a one dimensional flow equation the water exchange between the river channel and the slope cell is calculated based on different over flowing formulae which depend on water levels in the slope and the river as well as levee height conditions as described by sayama et al 2012 the amount of water exchange between the groundwater and the river flow is calculated based on modflow equations as described by brunner et al 2010 for a hydraulically connected system when the water table is above the elevation of the bottom of the riverbed at the slope river cell the amount of water exchanges between the river and the groundwater for the hydraulically disconnected system was set to be zero since surveyed data on the river cross section were not available for this research we used a regression equation reported by coe et al 2008 the geometry of the river channel was assumed to be rectangular and its properties were defined by three parameters i e river width river depth and river embankment height which were estimated based on the empirical function of upstream contributing area a in square km 15 w c w a s w 16 d c d a s d where w denotes width m and d denotes depth m cw sw cd and sd are geometry parameters 3 study area data and model setup 3 1 study area this study selected two river basins located in sri lanka based on the rainfall climatology of the island for the web rri model development and verification the spatial distribution of rainfall climatology in sri lanka is highly variable mainly due to seasonally varying monsoon systems i e southwest and northeast monsoons and their interactions with topography the highlands which are situated in the south central part of the island fig 2 a play an important role as physiographical climatic barriers for generating heterogeneous regional rainfall characteristics throughout the island during the southwest monsoon period i e may to september the southern and western regions receive an ample supply of rainfall 1000 4000 mm whereas the northern and eastern regions receive a very limited amount of rainfall 500 mm due to the shadow effect of the highlands similarly during the northeast monsoon i e december to february the eastern and south eastern regions receive a considerable amount of rainfall 500 1200 mm and the southern and western regions come under the shadow of the highlands department of meteorology sri lanka 2019 as a result the mean annual rainfall in sri lanka varies from under 1200 mm in the dry zone i e from the north western to south eastern regions to over 5000 mm in the wet zone i e the south western region therefore this research has selected two river basins for verifying the model applications in the wet and the dry climatic regions in sri lanka the kalu river basin which is located in the wet zone and receives ample of rainfall 3000 mm year throughout the year and the mundeni river basin which is located mostly in the dry zone and receives moderate rainfall 1400 2000 mm year in less than a half year with a little rain for the rest of the year the model simulations and its verifications in the different climatic conditions will enhance the confidence level of the model applicability under changing climate the characteristics of the basins are summarized in the following sections 3 1 1 the kalu river basin the kalu river basin is located in the south western part of sri lanka fig 2 a and b the main river the kalu river is about 130 km long originating in the central hills about an altitude of 2000 m from msl of the country and discharging into the indian ocean the catchment area of the basin is about 2800 km2 the basin is located in the wet zone 2500 mm year and receives an annual rainfall of 4000 mm on average which is significantly higher compared to other river basins in the country the river discharges about 7000 million cubic meters mcm to the indian ocean every year a run off type power plant with a capacity of 70 mw is installed in the kukule river fig 2 b which is one of the tributaries the basin experiences floods frequently due to heavy rainfall events topographic characteristics steep and flat terrains and demographic situations therefore two administrative districts i e ratnapura and kalutara are severely affected a previous study on this river basin by nandalal 2009 proposed a set of scenarios based on the upstream river discharges to estimate the downstream water levels for disaster early warning therefore developing a web rri model for this basin can contribute for water related disaster early warning flood monitoring forecasting and preparedness activities 3 1 2 the mundeni river basin the mundeni river basin is located in the eastern part of sri lanka fig 2 a and c the longest river segment is about 86 km also originating in the central hills about an altitude of 850 m from msl of the country and discharging into the batticaloa lagoon and the bay of bengal the catchment area of the basin is about 1375 km2 the upstream of the basin receives an annual rainfall of 2000 mm and the downstream of the basin receives an annual rainfall of 1400 mm table 2 the estimated river discharge to the batticalo lagoon and the bay of bengal totals about 900 mcm every year the rugam tank a small reservoir with a capacity of 22 mcm is located in the lower reach of the river as depicted in fig 2 c for facilitating rice cultivation during the dry season april september a new reservoir was constructed during 2007 2013 in upstream of the basin i e rambukan oya dam with a capacity of 56 mcm to cater the needs for drinking water and irrigation in the basin fig 2 c previously yoshimoto and amarnath 2017 developed the rri model to demonstrate flood monitoring applications using satellite rainfall data in this basin their study was limited to flood application and thus did not include the long term basin hydrology due to the limitations in the rri model however their results showed that the simulated hydrographs for the flood events need improvements 3 2 data and model setup 3 2 1 topographic data soil type land use and vegetation data topographic data including digital elevation models

methods to the original srtm data soil type land use and vegetation data influence the generation of surface sub surface and river flows soil type distribution data were obtained from the food and agriculture organization fao at 9 km spatial resolution http www fao org the soil datasets contain soil related parameters including saturated hydraulic conductivity for surface soil layer root zone and groundwater layer saturated soil moisture content residual soil moisture content and van genutchen parameters i e alpha and n the land use data were collected from the united states geological survey usgs global datasets with a spatial resolution of 1 km the sib2 model reclassifies land use or vegetation type data of usgs sellers et al 1996a fig 3 show the spatial distribution of static data such as digital elevation model dem and land use type used in web rri modelling for both basins the sib2 model also requires fraction of photo synthetically active radiation fpar and leaf area

locations throughout the island and river discharge observations by the irrigation department for the kalu river basin study daily rainfall data from 44 stations inside and outside the basin were collected for 1981 2010 fig 2 b shows the locations of the daily rain gauges and their spatial distribution table 1 shows the names and latitudes and longitudes of the rain gauge locations and annual average rainfall amounts mm recorded at each location for the period of 1981 2010 most of the rain gauges particularly the ones in hilly regions are in the premises of the tea and rubber plantation estates for the model calibration and validation of simulated streamflow this research used discharge data which was collected during 1981 1999 at the putupaula station 6 61 n 80 06 e in the lower kalu river as shown in fig 2 b the function of the kukule run off type power plant impacts the flow condition marginally at the putupaula gauging station for the mundeni river basin study daily

is located downstream of the gauging point however the newly constructed dam i e rambukan oya dam has impacted the flow condition at the tempitiya gauging stations since 2010 which is out of the selected simulation period i e 1992 2009 for the model validation 3 2 3 japanese reanalysis jra data meteorological forcing inputs for the web rri model such as air temperature wind speed shortwave downward radiation longwave radiation specific humidity and surface pressure were obtained from the japanese 55 year reanalysis jra 55 data the jra 55 data are prepared by the japan meteorological agency jma as a second japanese global atmospheric reanalysis using an advanced data assimilation system and a newly prepared global dataset of past observations the analysis period of jra 55 data covers 55 years from 1958 from the date when regular radiosonde observation began globally it is one of the high quality homogeneous re analysis climate datasets covering the last half century of the entire globe kobayashi et al 2015 the jra 55 data are available at 3 hour temporal resolution and 0 125 spatial resolutions for air temperature wind speed specific humidity and surface pressure and 0 56 spatial resolutions for downward radiations respectively these data were interpolated to model grid resolutions of 450 m and a model temporal resolution of 1 h using a linear interpolation method 3 2 4 evapotranspiration data this research used two independent et datasets to verify the model performance on simulating the et fluxes at a basin scale the selected datasets were from the modis

soil intercepted rainwater by the canopy and the transpiration by vegetation the mod16a2 terrestrial et products were estimated using an improved algorithm by mu et al 2011 the net et products were produced at 8 day temporal resolution and 500 m spatial resolution globally the algorithm for et estimation was formulated on the basis of the penman monteith equation which includes inputs of daily meteorological reanalysis data along with modis remotely sensed data products such as vegetation property dynamics albedo and land cover numerous factors affect remotely observed et estimation and their verification such as the complexity of land surface processes plant biophysics soil properties soil moisture the footprint mismatch between satellite data and ground observations cloud condition

the irrigation department of sri lanka for the 2003 flood event in the kalu river basin however such a dataset was not available for the mudeni river basin and therefore the modis surface reflectance products mod09a1 were utilized to estimate the flood inundation extent mod09a1 version 08 product includes bands from 1 to 7 of modis surface reflectance data at 500 meter spatial and 8 day temporal resolutions in the sinusoidal projection the modified land surface water index mlswi which was proposed by kwak 2017 was employed in this research to obtain the flood inundation extent the mlswi was defined as mlswi 1 r nir r swir 1 r nir r swir where r stands for reflectance values nir stand for near infrared reflectance i e band 2 and swir stands for shortwave infrared reflectance i e band 7 respectively a threshold value of the mlswi 0 6 was chosen to differentiate water cells from other land covers based on their spectral properties 3 3 model discharge evaluation indices mean bias error

wave formulations from the rri model for realistic estimations of water and energy budget processes land atmosphere interactions soil and vegetation water storages and flow amounts and directions for enhancing the model applications to integrated water resources management as well as water related disaster management at a catchment scale this study also investigated the performances of the web rri model in the kalu and mundeni river basins which are located in the wet and dry zones of sri lanka respectively the model performances were evaluated using the available records of observed discharges ground and satellite derived inundation extents and modis and gleam terrestrial et products the results are discussed in the following sections 4 1 comparison of river discharges 4 1 1 model calibration and validation meteorological inputs for the web rri model were prepared for the period of available rainfall observation records i e 1981 2009 for the kalu river basin and 1992 2009 for the mundeni river basin at model grid resolutions the daily rainfall records were interpolated at each model grid using the theisen method and at 1 hour temporal resolution using the uniform distribution method for both basins in the case of the kalu river basin a warm up simulation was set up for the period from 1981 to 1992 to obtain the improved initial conditions for model calibration the discharge data of 1993 at the putuapula gauging point were used for model parameter calibration the validation of calibrated model parameters was conducted using observed discharge data at the same gauging point for 1994 the model performance was evaluated using mbe rmse and nash as described in section 3 3 fig 4 a and b compare the observed daily discharges with the web rri simulated daily discharges from january 1 to december 31 1993 for model calibration and from january 1 to december 31 1994 for model validation in the kalu river basin generally floods in the kalu basin occur during the south west monsoon period may september in 1993 there were two flood peaks at the beginning of june and july during the calibration run the calibrated model parameters are given in table 3 after the calibration of soil and river parameters the model reproduced the hydrological responses of the basin satisfactorily compared to the observed records at the putupaula station with nash equal to 0 94 mbe equal to 7 7 m3 s and rmse equal to 60 m3 s particularly the base flow during the dry period january to may and the peak flow during the wet period were well calibrated in the model for the validation of the soil and river parameters these parameters as shown in table 3 were kept constant the model was used to simulate the basin hydrological responses for 1994 and the results were compared with the observed river discharges at the same location during the validation experiments the results also showed very good agreement with the observed discharges nash 0 92 mbe 11 8 m3 s and rmse 49 m3 s in addition the simulated peak discharges during the flooding periods and the low flows during the dry periods were well reproduced by the web rri model for validation experiments similarly fig 5 a and b compare the observed daily discharges with the web rri simulated daily discharges from june 1 1992 to may 31 1993 for model calibration and from june 1 1993 to may 31 1994 for model validation in the mundeni river basin generally the basin is very dry from march to november for about 7 months the discharge is less than 1 m3 s at the gauging point and the flow in the river starts to rise from the middle of november and reaches its peak at the end of december and becomes dry again in march every year the model was calibrated for the whole one year period including dry and wet spells and the model calibrated parameters are given in table 3 in this basin the performance indices of the web rri model were also very high nash 0 92 mbe 2 17 m3 s and rmse 16 m3 s as shown in fig 5 a the simulation results for the validation of the model parameters were also satisfactory and in very good agreements with the observed discharges nash 0 93 mbe 3 74 m3 s and rmse 17 m3 s as shown in fig 5 b particularly the simulated peak discharges during the wet period were well reproduced by the web rri model for calibration and validation experiments furthermore a long term model validation experiment was conducted by simulating the hydrological responses of the kalu basin for about 20 years and the simulated river discharges were compared with the observed discharges fig 6 a compares the model simulated discharges with the observed discharges at the patupaula gauging station from 1981 to 1999 for 20 years as shown in fig 6 a the model simulated discharges matched the observed discharges during the simulation period and the model performance indices were well estimated i e nash 0 89 mbe 4 7 m3 s rmse 67 m3 s similarly a long term simulation was performed for validating the model simulated hydrological responses of the mundeni river basin from 1992 to 2009 for 17 years the simulated discharges were compared with the observed discharges at the tempitiya gauging point and the results are shown in fig 6 b in the case of the mundeni river basin the long term model simulated river discharges also matched the observed records and the model performance indices were well estimated their values were 0 93 for nash 2 1 m3 s for mbe and 16 m3 s for rmse it could also be noted from fig 6 b that the observed discharges for several years e g 1996 1997 1997 1998 2001 2002 2003 2004 2008 2009 were much less compared to those for other years it also be noted that the period 1997 1998 was a strong el niño year and that 2002 2003 and 2009 2010 were moderate el niño years in addition 1995 1996 was a moderate la niña year and 1998 1999 1999 2000 and 2007 2008 were strong la niña years these initial investigations showed that the warm and cold phases of the el niño southern oscillation commonly called enso in the central and east central equatorial pacific influence the rainfall characteristics and drought conditions of the mundeni river basin whereas there are no such clear differences in the observed river discharges and thus the enso effect was not clearly visible in the kalu river basin during the identified years the wet years in the mundeni river basin with higher discharges 500 m3 s i e 1992 1993 normal year 2000 2001 weak la niña year 2002 2003 moderate el niño year and 2004 2005 weak el niño year showed mixed responses to the enso phenomena further investigations are necessary for the complete understanding of the enso and their influence on the hydro meteorological characteristics in the eastern dry zone of sri lanka 4 1 2 comparison of high flow simulations as described in introduction one of the objectives of the web rri model development is to improve the initial water storages in soil and vegetation and the initial river flow conditions and thereby reduce the effort for the repeated model calibration and improve the simulated flood hydrograph for real time flood monitoring and forecasting applications for the verification of the objectives the simulated high flow events from the model outputs were investigated against observed data in both river basins in the case of the kalu river basin discharge events which exceeded a river discharge of 1000 m3 s i e above the minor flood level at the putupaula station were extracted from the long term simulation results to examine the model performance in each event fig 7 a d compare the extracted observed flood peak discharges with those of the model simulations during 1981 1999 there was a total of four flood peaks that exceeded the limit in 1982 1989 1993 and 1999 as shown in the figure the model simulated peak discharges and their timings matched the observed discharges for all four peak flow cases with nash values greater than 0 84 most importantly the low flows just before the flood events also matched the observed low flows which indicates that the model simulated soil moisture and vegetation storages were reasonably produced just prior to the flooding therefore satisfying one of the requirements for the web rri model development these results showed that the model developed for the kalu river basin well reproduced the hydrological responses of the basin particularly the low flow conditions just before the flood and the peak discharges during the floods therefore the model satisfied the requirements and can be used for real time flood monitoring and forecasting activities i e warm model start up without any further tuning with a great confidence in the simulated results similarly in the case of the mundeni river basin the discharge events which exceeded a river discharge of 400 m3 s at the tempitiya station there are no prescribed flood levels at this station were extracted from the long term simulation and the results were compared with the observed discharges as shown in fig 8 a d there were a total of four cases that exceeded the limit of 400 m3 s in 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 and 2007 as shown in the figure the similar results as obtained for the kalu river basin were obtained for the mundi river basin and the model simulated peak discharges matched the observed discharges for all four peak flow cases with nash values greater than 0 84 in addition the low flows just before the flood events also matched the observed low flows which further confirms good model performance in reliable estimations of soil moisture and vegetation storages and high model applicability to flood peak simulations in the semi arid regions as well as applicability to real time flood monitoring and forecasting activities for simulating flood related disaster risk and damage 4 1 3 comparison of flow regime properties to investigate the overall performance of the web rri model in simulating peak moderate and low flow rates the flow duration curves fdcs were prepared an fdc provides a relationship between a given river discharge rate and the percentage of time that the river discharge rate is equalled or exceeded for a particular watershed vogel and fennessey 1995 fdcs are very useful tools for representing the flow regime s properties for a river basin by exhibiting the entire range of river discharges in log scale from low flows to flood events it has been used for a number of applications in hydrology and water resources management including hydropower water supply irrigation planning and hydrological drought analysis it can also provide information on changes in flow regime in a watershed due to land use and or climate change and therefore reasonable accuracy in reconstructing fdcs from model simulations are required for the model applications for drought and climate change impact assessment studies fig 9 a is an fdc plot at the putupaula station for the period of 1981 1999 for 20 years and fig 9 b is an fdc plot at the tempitiya station in 1992 2009 for 17 years the two figures show very steep gradients visible at the higher end of the observed spectrum 5 time flow equalled or exceeded which indicates the common behaviours of rain caused floods in the small catchments however the gradients below the higher end and in the middle regions differ when compared for both basins the gradient for the kalu river basin is much flatter than that for the mundeni river basin this indicates that the moderate streamflow is sustained throughout the year in the kalu river basin but it is not the case in the mundeni river basin on the other hand the flow regime in the mundeni river basin showed that the low streamflow of 10 m3 s corresponding to the 50 time flow was equalled or exceeded and thus for about a half year the river discharges are less than 10 m3 s in this basin as shown in fig 9 a the reproduction of the simulated fdc is in good agreement with the observed fdc for the entire 20 year period in the kalu river basin the estimated pearson correlation coefficient between observed and simulated discharges was about 0 93 particularly the flow regime between 10 500 m3 s was consistent with the observed flow regime it could also be noted that the model simulated extremely low flow discharges 10 m3 s were slightly higher than the observed values but the exceedance probability corresponding to 10 m3 s was almost 1 these differences are due to water extraction for rural drinking water supply minor irrigation schemes and water accumulation for minor runoff type hydropower generation in the upper streams which are not taken into account for the web rri modelling therefore these results confirmed the better performance of the model for the entire streamflow spectrum in the kalu river basin similarly as shown in fig 9 b the simulated flow regime for the higher end of the spectrum between 100 and 700 m3 s coincided well with the observation for the mundeni river basin the estimated pearson correlation coefficient between observed and simulated discharges was about 0 96 for the entire flow regime however the flow regime simulated to be between 8 100 m3 s showed an underestimation tendency whereas the flow regime simulated to be less than 8 m3 s showed an overestimation tendency as shown in fig 2 b and c the total number of the rain gauges in the kalu river basin was higher 44 locations for 2800 km2 of the catchments area or the rain gauge density is 64 km2 gauge and they were able to capture the heterogeneity in rainfall spatial distribution whereas the total number of the rain gauges in the mundeni river basin was much smaller 4 locations for 1375 km2 of the catchments area or the rain gauge density is 350 km2 gauge and thus they may not be able to capture the heterogeneity in rainfall spatial distribution within the basin particularly in addition to the large scale monsoon and low pressure depression driven rainfall phenomena in the island other phenomena such as small scale convectional rainfall events which occur at a relatively short period of time with higher peaks are more commonly observed in the dry zone it is expected that adding a few more gauges in the upper and middle streams of the basin or combining the gauge data with satellite rainfall estimates can improve the simulation of the basin s hydrological regime between 8 and 100 m3 s in addition the overestimation of the flow regime less than 8 m3 s by the web rri model is due to the water usage for drinking and minor irrigation schemes at the upper stream of the catchment these results showed that the flow regime s properties in both river basins are reasonably reproduced by the web rri model including moderate to low stream flows which indicates that the model is applicable to drought land use and climate change impact assessment studies 4 2 comparison of terrestrial evapotranspiration the accurate estimation of the et component of the water budget in dhm is crucial for simulating accurate soil water storages flood peaks low flows for drought estimation and climate change impacts based on global warming scenarios to investigate the web rri performance in estimating the et component of the water budget two independent et products from the modis and gleam were obtained and processed at a basin scale for both basins the sib2 model is capable of calculating et fluxes individually from four different et components i e soil evaporation evaporation from ground intercepted water evaporation from vegetation intercepted water and transpiration from vegetation this capability of individually simulating each et components is a great advantage and provides an opportunity to investigate changes in land use or irrigation practices under changing climate conditions in the future web rri model application studies to compare the modis net et estimates with the model estimated et fluxes the arithmetic sum of all four et components of the web rri model was calculated and averaged on an 8 day basis at a basin scale the gleam et data was also averaged on an 8 day basis to compare all the products in the same time scale fig 10 a compares the 8 day averaged model simulated et fluxes with the modis observed 8 daily et fluxes and with the 8 day averaged gleam et fluxes the for 8 years 2002 2009 in the kalu river basin the same model which was developed and verified during 1981 1999 in the previous section 4 1 was applied to simulate the basin hydrological characteristics during 2002 2009 the observed discharges during 2000 2009 were under verification due to the detection of changes in the rating curve at the putupaula gauging station in the kalu river basin as shown in fig 10 a the modis as well as gleam et fluctuate between 6 mm day during the wet period and 2 5 mm day during the dry period and the model simulated et fluxes and its trend agreed well with both modis and gleam estimated et fluxes particularly the gleam et flux data showed very good matching in simulating the 8 day trend and its fluctuation with the web rri model outputs compared against the modis et data with the web rri model outputs as a result the model simulated et fluxes showed a relatively higher value for the pearson correlation coefficient r 0 39 with the gleam data as shown in fig 10 c than with the modis et data r 0 14 as shown in fig 10 b in addition the overall model performance indices for the et fluxes also agreed better with the gleam data i e mbe 0 32 mm day and rmse 0 73 mm day than that with the modis data i e mbe 0 33 mm day and rmse 1 04 mm day for the whole period in the kalu river basin similarly fig 11 a is compares estimated and model simulated et fluxes in the mundeni river basin for the same period in this basin the modis as well as the gleam et values fluctuate between 5 mm day during the wet period and 1 5 mm day during the dry period the overall et rates are lower by 1 mm day compared to the et rate in the kalu river basin throughout the period as the mundeni basin is located in the dry zone of sri lanka the estimated et products showed very clear seasonal changes particularly the decreasing trend from march to september and then the increasing trend from september october to february the identified seasonal variation of et fluxes and their values were well simulated by the web rri model and comparable to both reference datasets expect in a few years during the dry period e g 2003 and 2007 in 2003 the model simulated a dry condition i e low et fluxes whereas the both modis and gleam products showed a relatively wet ground condition i e high et fluxes similarly the model also simulated the dry condition in 2007 and during this period modis estimated a moderate dry condition however the gleam products showed a wet condition throughout the period and thus this problem could be due to a retrieval issue in the gleam products the investigation on the observed and simulated river flow conditions during the dry periods in 2003 and 2007 did not find any significant differences and therefore further investigation are needed on the modis and gleam et products rainfall data amount and distributions and model forcing data fig 11 b and c are scatter plots to compare the model simulated et fluxes with the modis and gleam et data for the entire period shown in fig 11 a and the performance indices are shown in the same figures the calculated rmse values for web rri et fluxes were almost same 0 95 for both reference datasets however the correlation coefficient of the web rri model is higher with the gleam products r 0 35 than with modis products r 0 25 the overall performance of the model simulated et fluxes in both basins matched well both modis and gleam data and the estimated performance indices for modis rmse 0 96 1 04 mm day r 0 14 0 25 and gleam rmse 0 73 0 95 mm day r 0 35 0 39 are within the ranges of the reported values in the previous studies which are summarized in section 3 2 4 the identified errors can be attributed to the missing values in modis data during the cloudy period particularly in the kalu river basin biases generated by modis and gleam et retrieval algorithms reanalysis datasets biases in modis lai data biases in meteorological inputs e g rainfall temperature and radiation errors in global land use and soil data and irrigation practices particularly in the mundeni river basin to investigate the model simulated spatial variation of the et fluxes with the modis and the gleam products over the basin the temporal averaging of et fluxes for each grid was performed from 2002 to 2009 and the spatial distributions of et fluxes from the web rri model were compared with modis and gleam fig 12 a c show the spatial distributions of mean et fluxes over the basin during 2002 2009 from the web rri model modis and gleam for the kalu river basin respectively fig 12 d and e show the differences in et fluxes between modis and the web rri model and gleam and web rri model for the same basin respectively the agreement of spatial distribution between the model and modis was quite high due to its high spatial resolution 500 m than gleam 25 km however the calculated differences show that modis overestimated et fluxes at many grid cells compared to gleam data and the values were high 2 mm day whereas the calculated differences for gleam were less than 1 mm day in most of the grids except over the river water cells it could also be noted that the web rri model underestimated the et fluxes over the water cells and along the river paths as shown in fig 12 d and e because the present web rri model treats them as land cells further improvements are needed to upgrade the evaporation component from the water cells similarly fig 13 a c compare the spatial distributions of mean et fluxes over the basin during 2002 2009 from the web rri model modis and gleam for the mundeni river basin respectively as shown in fig 13 b the modis observed et rates are higher in the most upstream part of the basin 4 mm day and are around 2 3 5 mm day in the middle to lower part of the basin due to the variation in the rainfall amount on the other hand the gleam et products showed a uniform distribution of et values that are ranging from 3 mm day to 3 5 mm day in the most of the grids due to its coarser resolution the web rri model simulation results showed that the simulated et rates are in very good agreement in the upstream part of the basin particularly model simulated results with the modis data the hotspots of high et fluxes can be clearly identified due to its fine resolution however when we investigated the differences estimated between the model and the reference data i e modis and gleam in the upstream region as shown in fig 13 d and e the differences were small 1 mm day in both calculations at the same time the model underestimated the et fluxes 1 2 mm day from the middle to lower part of the basin fig 13 d and e most of the underestimations were during the dry period i e may september as it was clearly seen in fig 11 a particularly the simulated et showed larger gaps with two sudden reductions in the et spatial distribution as similar to the interpolated rainfall distributed map by the theisen method not shown in the middle and the lower reaches of the basin as shown in fig 13 a however these unnatural discontinuities were not observed in the kalu basin simulation these larger discontinuities in the mundeni river basin resulted clearly due to limited rainfall observations fig 2 c larger differences in rainfall between the upper and lower reach rainfall gauges as shown in table 2 750 mm year biases generated by interpolated rainfall distributions by the theisen method biases in the recorded rainfall in the middle and lower regions of the basin which did not affect the flow simulations at the tempitiya gauging point trambauer et al 2014 and ramoelo et al 2014 also reported in their studies on validating modis et data that the accuracy of rainfall data was found to be significantly influential on the et amount and distribution a portion of the errors was also attributed to irrigation practices conducted for agricultural activities paddy cultivation in the middle to lower reaches during the dry period more data on rain gauges and irrigation practices data need to be introduced for the better simulation of the et fluxes by the web rri model in the middle to lower reaches during the dry period in this basin in general the model simulated results confirmed that vegetation penology and soil moisture dynamics were reliably incorporated within the model and their effects were reasonably simulated in estimating the et fluxes therefore the web rri model has the potential to estimate et fluxes reasonably well and could be improved further with improved model input data these results further confirm that the web rri model can be implemented for estimating past monitoring present or predicting future agricultural droughts as well as for land use and climate change impact assessment studies 4 3 comparison of inundation extents in all the river basins in sri lanka the duration of the flooding is very short and limited to 3 5 days due to smaller catchment areas in general ground based mapping of flooding is very challenging and costly satellite based mapping is commonly practiced by utilizing space borne sensors such as modis landsat and alos however the availability of satellite observations of past flood events over the kalu river basin was very limited and if available the data only covered a part of the basin or the basin was covered with clouds due to a very active rainfall system that prevails over the basin a major flood event was reported during may 19 21 2003 but the modis surface reflectance data were contaminated by clouds over the entire basin during this period fortunately a ground survey was conducted by the irrigation department of sri lanka for the 2003 may flood event covering the middle to lower parts of the kalu river basin therefore the surveyed flood inundation map of 2003 was obtained from the irrigation department of sri lanka and compared with the model simulated flood extents fig 14 a and b are the maps comparing flood inundation extents from surveyed data by the irrigation department of sri lanka and the simulated maximum flood inundation extents from the web rri model for the 2003 may flood event in the kalu river basin respectively as plotted in fig 14 a most of the observed inundation area was located along the main river of the basin that includes the ratnapura town the upstream area the kalutara town the downstream area as shown in fig 2 b and the in between areas generally the model simulated inundation extents fig 14 b matched the inundation extents surveyed by the irrigation department in addition to the flooding in the main river one of the major tributaries originating from the south and south eastern parts of the basin i e the kuda river also experienced floods during the same period and the model simulated results also produced the inundation extents reasonably well on the other hand the model underestimated the inundation extents in some areas particularly in the most downstream part of the basin and around the river mouth near the indian ocean this underestimation is due to the inaccuracies of satellite dem and the effect of coarse model resolution 500 m as well as the downstream flow discharge condition which is often influenced by the tidal phenomena and shrinkage of the river mouth due to sand deposition the calculated critical success index csi between the field surveyed and model inundation areas as described in section 3 3 was 0 35 the accuracy of the inundation extent can be further improved by incorporating ground based dem or lidar data for flat regions near the coastal belt tidal data and river mouth cross section data in future studies additionally the model also produced inundation information in the most upstream areas of the main river and its remote tributaries this information was not available from the survey records because the surveyed map was prepared for a limited area of the basin using ground truth at specific locations and therefore model outputs are very useful for developing a method for last one mile dissemination of early warning to remote areas in addition to the inundation extents the model can provide crucial information i e inundation depths fig 14 c which is very hard to obtain from remote sensing techniques and field measurements therefore both the model simulated inundation extents and flood depths are crucial information that has great potential for pre and post flood disaster relief rescue and mitigation activities and the results showed that the model produced such information reasonably well for the kalu river basin similarly as described in fig 8 c there was a flood event in the mundeni river basin during december 17 21 2004 though the modis surface reflectance 8 day data were contaminated by clouds during the heavy rainfall events the data collected just after the rainfall event i e during 2004 12 18 to 2004 12 25 were cloud free images and therefore they were processed for flood inundation mapping in this basin fig 15 a and b are the maps that compare the flood inundation extents derived from modis data as described in section 3 2 5 and simulated maximum flood inundation extents from the web rri model for the 2004 flood event in this basin respectively as shown in fig 15 a the modis detected false alarm of inundation areas in the most upstream part and along the southern edge of the basin on the other hand the modis detected inundation areas were located downstream of the tempitiya gauging station as the modis inundation data replicated the 8 day average condition of the land surface condition from december 18 2004 to december 25 2004 the data might have failed to capture the inundations along the river segments in the upstream area before december 18 2004 on the other hand the web rri model driven maximum flood inundation map captured the inundations along the river segments in the upstream area the estimated csi from modis and model inundation extents was about 0 2 for the mundeni basin the reasons for smaller csi are due to limited area coverage by modis time differences between model and observation data and particularly the formulation of csi itself as described in section 3 3 the csi calculation only considers the inundation grids from model and observation and does not consider the matching of non inundation grids for the index calculation in this study there was no overlapping periods where we could find cloud free modis reflectance data and other ground or satellite data for assessing the reliability of modis based flood mapping therefore the flood inundation mapping using modis reflectance data needs to be further investigated and validated using reliable ground based flood mapping data or other satellite data in future studies 5 conclusions dhms have become an essential tool in iwrm particularly due to ever increasing water related disasters dhms with the capability of simulating catchment scale rainfall runoff inundation processes are very informative and effective tools for proactive flood warning flood hazard mapping and flood risk management and assessment however runoff inundation type models used for flood depth and inundation estimations mainly consider the conservation of water balance and overlook several fundamental and critical water energy related parameters and physical processes e g soil moisture canopy interception et and soil vegetation atmosphere interactions with an assumption that their effects can be negligible during a flood event as a result uncertainties in the initial soil and vegetation water storages as well as the estimation of soil moisture canopy interception and et will cause biases in the model simulated outputs which will impact the reliability of simulated flood related parameters and associated flood related risk assessment and thus create the need for additional efforts for repeated event based model calibrations in addition the use of the models for other applications such as drought assessment or iwrm under changing climate becomes questionable since they do not estimate the impact of temperature and et on the water budget explicitly as a result to generate reliable information for supporting decision and policy making on iwrm as well as water related disaster management this study developed a new model the water and energy budget based rri web rri by combining the hydro sib2 model and the rri model s 1 d and 2 d flow equations to incorporate water and energy budget processes land vegetation atmosphere interactions multi layer soil moisture dynamics lateral water flows on the surface and sub surface and in rivers to improve interception et infiltration processes soil moisture runoff and inundation processes the model performance was assessed in the kalu river basin located in the wet zone and the mundeni river basin located in the dry zone of sri lanka the developed models were calibrated and validated for reproducing the observed hydrological responses of the basins at the patupaula station in the kalu river basin and at the tempitiya station in the mundeni river basin respectively the results showed that the nash values obtained from the modelled and observed discharges in both river basins were higher than 0 9 for both calibration and validation experiments a long term validation 1981 to 1999 for the kalu river basin showed that the model simulated discharges matched the observed discharges especially for low and peak flows with high model performance indices nash 0 89 mbe 4 7 m3 s rmse 67 m3 s a long term validation 1992 to 2009 for the mundeni river basin also showed that the model simulated discharges agreed well with the observed discharges and that the model performance indices were well estimated nash 0 93 mbe 2 1 m3 s rmse 16 m3 s in addition the model performance in simulating several peak flow conditions were investigated the model simulated outputs matched the observed peak conditions particularly the simulated low flow just before the flood and the peak flow during the flood as well as their timings coincided well with the observed discharges in both basins which indicates that the model reproduced the soil as well as vegetation storages reasonably well the long term observed and model simulated river discharges were used to construct the fdcs by plotting the complete range of river discharges in log scale from flood events to low flow conditions in order to investigate the model performance in reproducing the flow regime s properties for both river basins in the case of the kalu river basin the simulated flow regime matched the observed flow regime perfectly for the almost entire streamflow spectrum on the other hand in the case of the mundeni river basin though the simulated higher end of the stream flow spectrum agreed very well with the observed one the middle portion was underestimated partly due to the limited number of the rain gauges within the basin in addition the extremely low end of the simulated fdc was overestimated mainly due to water usage for drinking and minor irrigation schemes in the upstream area of the catchment these results from both river basins confirmed that the flow regime s properties can be reasonably reproduced by the web rri model and therefore the model can be used to assess flow regime changes due to land use and climate change scenarios the simulated et fluxes from the web rri were compared with the modis et and the gleam et products during 2002 2009 in general the model simulated et fluxes and its trend agreed well with the gleam et and modis et fluxes particularly the model simulated et fluxes showed a moderate correlation 0 35 0 39 and a low rmse 0 7 0 95 mm day with the gleam et fluxes in both basins whereas they showed a very low correlation 0 14 0 25 and a slightly higher rmse 0 96 1 04 mm day with the modis et fluxes in addition the simulated et rates and their trends matched the et rates obtained from modis and gleam in the both basins underestimations during the dry period i e may to september and two sudden reductions in the spatially distributed et rates were also observed in the mundeni river basin the biases can be attributed to errors in rainfall amount and its distributions the missing values in modis data during the cloudy period particularly in the kalu river basin error generated in the retrieval algorithms of modis and gleam modis lai data meteorological or reanalysis inputs e g temperature and radiation and irrigation practices particularly in the lower reach of the mundeni river basin the model simulated maximum inundation extents were compared with the ground surveyed flood inundation map for the 2003 flood event in the kalu river basin generally the model simulated inundation extents well matched the inundation extents obtained from ground surveyed data modis surface reflectance 8 day data were used to map inundation extents for the 2004 flood event in the mundeni river basin the model simulated inundation extents were comparable with the inundation extents derived from modis data in some areas the model underestimated the inundation extents particularly in the most downstream part of the basin due to the inaccuracies of satellite dem and the effect of coarse resolution 500 m as well as the downstream flow discharge conditions additionally the model produced inundation information in remote areas and provided inundation depth information which is very hard to obtain from remote sensing techniques or field measurements and therefore demonstrated great potential for pre and post flood disaster relief rescue and mitigation activities the accuracy of the inundation extent can be further improved by incorporating ground based dem or lidar data for flat regions near the coastal belt tidal data and river mouth cross section data the model produced inundation information and corresponding water depths in remote areas are very important and can be used for developing a last one mile information dissemination methodology for early warning and rescue operations the web rri model which was developed in this research incorporated all the essential physical formulations for water and energy budget components and land vegetation atmosphere interactions and thus showed good performance in estimating low flows the timing of the flood onset flood peak discharges et and inundation extents in the future this research will focus on expanding the model applicability to generate reliable information for supporting decision and policy making strategies on basin wide iwrm as well as water related disaster management by applying the model to long term simulations such as reproducing and projecting the responses of past and future climatology water cycle variability and hydrological extremes for catchments the research will also include operational applications of the model such as flood forecasting and seasonal prediction in its scope by coupling it with outputs from numerical weather and climate models as well as flood and drought related risk assessment 6 contributions all

6060,distributed hydrological models dhms with the capability of simulating catchment scale water and energy budgets as well as rainfall runoff inundation processes are essential tools for integrated water resource management iwrm as well as water related disaster risk reduction wdrr under changing climate this research developed a new dhm the water and energy budget based rainfall runoff

the simulated low flow just before the flood and the peak discharges during the flood as well as their timings coincided well with the observed discharges in both basins which indicates that the model is capable of reproducing soil and vegetation water storages reasonably well and therefore it can be used for real time and forecasting applications with the re starting capability the model simulated

discharges evapotranspiration inundation 1 introduction water is an integral part of life on the earth and thus its cycle is an extremely important process for the existence of all living organisms on the planet throughout the human history the societies have been severely affected by hydro meteorological extremes and thus there have been tremendous efforts to understand assess and predict the water cycle and its impacts on the climate system in recent years fatalities and economic damages caused by storms floods and droughts have significantly increased in the world due to global warming and accelerated population growth winsemius 2015 unisdr 2018 global warming plays an increasingly important role in driving up climate and hydrological extremes by accelerating the water cycle modifying the seasonal patterns and thus threatening to the security of water resources and sustainable development huntington 2006 oki and kanae 2006 hirabayashi et al 2013 ipcc climate change 2014 at the same time ever increasing population growth places additional pressures on the availability of water resources for food water energy consumption and effective measures for disaster risk mitigation and adaptation therefore decision makers crucially require reliable information on water resources as well as water related disasters to quantify hydrological risk i e the combination of hazard vulnerability and exposure for efficient management of resources and effective strategies for adaptation and mitigation hydrological models which are used for understanding various watershed hydrological processes and predicting watershed behaviours have become essential tools for generating information on water resources and water related disasters to support decision making strategies chow et al 1988 over the years hydrological modelling has evolved from simple concepts to very complex physically meaningful and distributed approaches todini 2007 singh 2018 pioneering achievements in hydrological modelling has taken place mainly due to increasing availability of spatially distributed ground and satellite data improved understanding of hydrological processes advancements in computer resources that have boosted the development of several distributed hydrological models dhms and the integration of various physical processes and techniques abbott et al 1986 bathurst et al 1995 yang et al 2000 2004 arnold et al 1998 de roo et al 2000 wang et al 2009a yamazaki et al 2014 particularly due to ever increasing flood disasters and devastating flood damage globally which are more frequently reported than those caused by any other type of natural disasters freer et al 2011 dhms which integrated the capabilities of simulating catchment scale rainfall runoff inundation processes e g mike she refsgaard and storm 1995 lisflood van der knijff et al 2010 and rainfall runoff inundation rri sayama et al 2012 are considered to be very informative and effective tools for developing a proactive flood early warning system and mapping flood hazards to provide crucial flood related information for flood risk management and damage assessment these types of models are capable of providing additional information e g inundation extents flooding depths and most importantly the direction of flow paths as the flood water travels compared to typical i e kinematic wave dhms in which water flows along the defined flow directions bates and de roo 2000 horritt and bates 2001 wilson et al 2007 hunter et al 2007 bates et al 2010 sayama et al 2012 however runoff inundation type models or flood depth and inundation estimations mainly consider the conservation of water balance at a catchment scale model related uncertainty arises mainly due to negligence of several fundamental and critical water energy related parameters and physical processes e g soil moisture canopy interception evapotranspiration et and soil vegetation atmosphere interactions which cannot be overlooked even for flood related applications particularly in arid and semi arid regions for example the amount of moisture within the soil layers controls the surface runoff and infiltration ratio whereas the accurate estimation of the soil vegetation et component of the water budget is crucial for simulating accurate soil vegetation water storages river discharges and flood depths the negligence of essential physical formulations for water and energy budget components and land vegetation atmosphere interactions within rainfall runoff inundation modelling will result in several critical issues in applying these types of models for scientific and operational flood related applications under changing climate one of those critical issues is that uncertainties in the initial soil and vegetation water storages will impact the reliability of simulated flood related parameters and associated flood related risk assessments for past events and therefore additional efforts and time are required for repeated model calibrations for each flood event to obtain reasonable model simulated outputs another issue is that when applying the model to operational flood monitoring and forecasting activities unreliable initial storages will introduce larger uncertainties in the timing of simulated flood onset peak discharges and inundation depths and therefore its output needs to be handled with great caution third as the severity of drought and flooding conditions are expected to increase in the future climate and the extreme climate sequences of dry wet periods are also expected to be modified madakumbura et al 2019 due to virtually certain global warming and an increasing rate of evapotranspiration the applicability of these models to the projected future climate will introduce additional uncertainties in flood related simulation and risk assessment fourth the use of the models beyond flood applications such as for drought assessment or integrated water resources management also becomes questionable as they do not estimate the impact of temperature and evapotranspiration on the water budget explicitly these issues have been recognized as major drawbacks for the applicability of water budget models to water resources management as well as to water related disaster management under changing climate sayama et al 2012 presented a water budget model i e the rainfall runoff inundation rri model for flood applications by employing two dimensional diffusion wave equations to simulate water depths in each orthogonal grid cell and hence integrate the processes of rainfall runoff and the propagation of flood inundation simultaneously the model has been applied to several event based flood simulations and inundation analyses sayama et al 2012 perera et al 2014 nastiti et al 2015 sayama et al 2015 yoshimoto and amarnath 2017 sayama et al 2017 and flood damage assessment shrestha et al 2015 assuming the effect of evapotranspiration soil and vegetation interception stream aquifer interaction can be negligible during a flood event due to these assumptions and the omission of soil vegetation atmosphere interactions of catchment scale hydrological processes the present applications of the model are restricted only to past flood events on the other hand the physical basis of land surface models lsms for the representations of soil vegetation atmosphere interactions et soil moisture dynamics and the incorporation of space born distributed data for reliable vegetation phenology can overcome the issues found in typical water budget based dhms in the past several studies emphasized the importance of lsms in dhms and merged both models to integrate the characteristics of both lsms and flow routing models rigon et al 2006 wang et al 2009a particularly wang et al 2009c coupled a modified simple biosphere model version 2 sib2 model hydro sib2 with a semi distributed geomorphology based hydrological model gbhm a coupled model water and energy budget based distributed hydrological model web dhm has been verified extensively for the representation of physical processes and its applications such as simulation of hydrological responses and the energy budget wang et al 2009a surface temperature and heat budget analysis wang et al 2009b frozen soil processes wang et al 2010 drought analysis jaranilla sanchez et al 2011 snow hydrology shrestha et al 2012 and climate change impact assessment bhatti et al 2016 however this model is not applicable to simulating flood inundation processes in a watershed due to its semi distributed model structure and kinematic wave approximation for water flow estimation which completely omits inundation processes and thus may lead to the overestimation of river discharges in the downstream regions therefore the applicability of web dhm or similar web models which are based on kinematic wave formulations is limited to discharge estimation in the hill terrain of a watershed and cannot be used for flood inundation estimation damage analysis and flood risk analysis in a watershed accordingly this research presents the development of a new model the water and energy budget based rainfall runoff inundation web rri model by integrating previous studies by wang et al 2009a and sayama et al 2012 for integrated water resources management as well as water related disaster management particularly the hydro sib2 model was coupled with the rri model s 2 d flow equations to incorporate water and energy budget processes land vegetation atmosphere interactions multi layer soil moisture dynamics and 2 d lateral water flows to improve interception et infiltration processes runoff and inundation processes as the web rri model takes into account the entire natural hydrological processes of a catchment the model overcomes the limitations identified separately for web dhm and rri models and thus can be used for solving issues in integrated water resources management as well as water related disaster management under the variability of the water cycle as well as changing climate the new model has several merits it incorporates physical formulations for et fluxes soil and vegetation interception and soil moisture dynamics which will improve the accuracy of low flow estimation the timing of flood onset flood peak discharges and inundation depths and extents and then improve the reliability of flood and drought related risk assessment for past events as it takes more inputs e g radiation temperature humidity wind speed leaf area index in addition to precipitation the model will produce reliable responses to the water cycle variability as well as climate change scenarios and therefore it can be used for long term simulations such as reproducing past and projecting future climatology and hydrological extremes of a catchment with a great confidence moreover the model inputs are compatible with numerical weather and climate model outputs thus it can use those outputs directly to estimate basin scale hydrological responses to the model predicted forcing data finally owing to its complete representation of hydrological components of arid and semi arid regions the model can reproduce the actual conditions of hydrological parameters at each time step provided that input data are accurate enough and can be stopped at any time step and restarted from the previous history to reduce the computational burden of pre running of the model for the warming up period in practical applications such as flood forecasting and seasonal prediction this research paper is arranged as follows section 2 presents the overall structure major components and formulation of the web rri model the study area data and model setup are discussed in section 3 the simulation results are analysed and discussed in section 4 and the conclusions are given in section 5 2 model structure and processes this section describes the overall structure of the web rri model its formulations of physical processes including the vertical transfer of moisture and energy fluxes soil vegetation atmosphere interactions soil structure soil moisture dynamics lateral movements of water flow and interaction between vertical and horizontal water flows 2 1 the overall structure of the web rri model the overall web rri model structure fig 1 was divided into four major modules 1 the simple biosphere model 2 sib2 module for the vertical energy and water flux transfer between land and atmosphere for each model grid 2 the vertical soil moisture distribution module based on richard s equation and darcy s equations for groundwater recharge 3 the 2 d diffusive wave lateral flow module for surface flow and groundwater flow and 4 the 1 d diffusive wave river flow module the interactions between surface flow and river flow groundwater flow and soil moisture contents and groundwater flow and river discharge were also implemented in the web rri model the following sections briefly describe the model formulations and their processes 2 2 model formulations 2 2 1 sib2 module for vertical water and energy flux transfer between land and atmosphere this study used sib2 to simulate vertical energy and water fluxes and their transfer between land and atmosphere the sib2 model was developed by sellers et al 1996a b it uses a soil vegetation atmosphere transfer svat scheme in which heat and moisture fluxes originate from soil surface and vegetation canopy sib2 incorporates many significant changes from its original version including reduction of the number of model parameters incorporation of satellite remote sensing observation to describe surface vegetation conditions and its penology and replacement of empirical stomatal models with a photosynthesis conductance model as shown in fig 1 the original sib2 model was formulated to include three soil layers a surface soil layer d1 0 5 cm which acts as the source of direct evaporation when it is moist a root zone d2 5 20 cm which supplies the soil moisture to the vegetation roots and then for transpiration by leaves and a deep soil layer d3 which provides upward recharge of the root zone and source for hydrological base flow the complete formulation of interception evaporation infiltration vertical soil moisture transport plant transpiration and turbulent heat fluxes can be found in sellers et al 1996a the following section provides a brief summary of the governing equations the mass balance equation for the plant canopy interception is given by 1 m cw t p d d d c e ci ρ w the mass balance equation for the ground interception is given by 2 m gw t d d d c e gi ρ w where subscripts cw and gw denote canopy and ground water storage respectively m p d d and d c are the intercepted water m precipitation m s canopy through fall rate m s and canopy drainage rate m s respectively e ci and e gi are the evaporation rates of intercepted water kg m 2 s from canopy and ground ρ w is the density of water k g m 3 and t is time in seconds the maximum amount of canopy interception per unit area is defined by the leaf area index lai times 0 0001 m canopy temperature t c in kelvin is given by 3 c c t c t r nc h c λ e c ξ c ground surface temperature t g in kelvin is given by 4 c g t g t r ng h g λ e g ξ g 2 π c g t g t d τ d deep soil temperature t d in kelvin is given by 5 c d t d t 2 π c g t g t d τ d 365 π where subscripts c g and d represent canopy ground and deep soil respectively r n h λ e and ξ are the net radiation sensible heat flux latent heat flux energy transfer due to phase change in w m 2 respectively c is the effective heat capacity in j k g 1 k 1 and τ d 8400 s as similarly to sib2 the web rri also estimates et from the vegetation canopy and the soil surface the canopy et is based on the evaporation of intercepted water by the canopy and the vegetation transpiration which is extracted by the root system from the root zone soil water the surface evaporation is estimated from the direct evaporation of the surface layer soil moisture and puddled water held on the soil surface 2 2 2 vertical soil moisture distribution the representation of soil water movement in the original concept of the sib2 model is based on three zones layers i e surface soil layer root zone and deep soil layer and uses the finite difference method to solve the equation as shown in fig 1 in the web rri model the root and deep soil layers are divided into many sub soil layers to better represent the vertical water exchanges in the soil layers as described by wang et al 2009a the unsaturated zone vertical flow is given by the following water balance equations surface layer soil moisture w 1 is given by 6 w 1 t 1 θ s d 1 q 1 q 1 2 e g ρ w δ 1 root zone soil moisture w ri is given by 7 w ri t 1 θ s d i q i 1 i q i i 1 e ct i ρ w δ ri deep layer soil moisture w di is given by 8 w di t 1 θ s d i q i 1 i q i δ di where q 1 is the infiltration of water into the first soil layer m s q i 1 i is the water flow from the i 1 th layer to the i th layer e g is the ground surface evaporation rate from surface soil layer e ct i is the vegetation canopy transpiration rate through the stomata k g m 2 s in the i th layer of the root zone d i is the depth of the i th soil layer m θ s is the saturated volumetric water content m 3 m 3 ρ w is the density of water k g m 3 and δ is the flow added or subtracted due to the horizontal and vertical movement of ground water flow in the web rri model the depth of the total unsaturated soil layer changes with the fluctuation of the groundwater table at the beginning of each time step sib2 updates the ground interception and the surface wetness w 1 as an input to the sub layer soil model then the multi layer soil model estimates vertical interlayer water exchanges and soil moisture changes based on one dimensional richard s equation for unsteady and unsaturated flow in a porous medium for each sub layer at the end of all simulations at a particular time step the soil water contents in all three main soil layers are recalculated from updated soil moisture information which is stored in memory for the next model time step and passed to the sib2 module in the case of groundwater recharge estimation when the ground water level d g is below the soil depth d s the web rri model uses darcy s model for the gravitational vertical flow in this module no lateral water exchanges from the surface or subsurface are calculated 2 2 3 2 d diffusive wave lateral flow model for surface and groundwater flows surface or over land flow is formulated using the method employing the rri model presented by sayama et al 2012 in rri both surface and subsurface flows are combined together and the same algorithm is used to simulate lateral flow whereas in web rri surface flow is separated from subsurface flow by incorporating a multi layer soil model the effective overland storage of water after deducting for all losses interception et and infiltration is estimated in the sib2 module and the vertical soil moisture distribution added to the previous step water level at each grid cell and then passed to the 2 d diffusive wave module the water flow from and to each slope grid cell is calculated with a 2 d diffusive shallow water wave model derived from the continuity equation momentum equations for gradually varying unsteady flow conditions and manning s equation with the assumption that inertia terms can be neglected for the diffusive wave approximation the final equations for directional overland flows are derived as follows the equations for flow calculations in x and y directions are as follows 9 q x 1 n h 5 3 h x sgn h x 10 q y 1 n h 5 3 h y sgn h y the mass balance equation is spatially discretized for calculating changes in water level at each grid as follows 11 d h i j dt q x i 1 j q x i j δ x q y i j 1 q y i j δ y h e i j where q x and q y are the unit width discharges in x and y directions n is manning s roughness parameter h is the height of water from the surface h is the height of water from the datum sgn is the signum function q x i j and q y i j are the discharges in x and y directions from a grid cell at a location i j and h e i j is the effective overland storage of water m due to rainfall after accounting all the sinks interception et and infiltration and sources e g upward movement of ground water flow at a grid cell location i j lateral groundwater flow for an unconfined and infinite aquifer is formulated as follows 12 q gx k g f g e f g d g h g x 13 q gy k g f g e f g d g h g y where q gx and q gy are the unit width discharges in x and y directions h g is the height of ground water from the datum msl d g is the depth to the ground water table from the ground level f g is a parameter controlling the vertical exponential decay in the saturated hydraulic conductivity and k g is the saturated conductivity of the groundwater layer the mass balance equation for calculating changes in groundwater level at each grid is defined as 14 d h g i j dt q gx i 1 j q gx i j δ x q gy i j 1 q gy i j δ y to solve the above mentioned equations the fifth order runge kutta approximation with adaptive time step control is applied to both surface flow and groundwater flow calculations in the web rri model the lateral flow within the unsaturated soil layer is not estimated due to a high degree of complexity 2 2 4 1 d diffusive wave river routing module similar to rri the web rri model also treats slopes and river channels at each grid cell separately a river channel in the web rri model is discretized as a single channel along the centreline of the slope grid cell when the model detects a river channel based on flow accumulation information it considers that both slope and river channel are positioned within the same grid cell as described earlier the water flow on the slope is estimated using 2d diffusive wave equations on the other hand the river flow river routing is estimated using a 1d diffusive wave equation which is the same equation as eq 9 and q y was set it to zero to get a one dimensional flow equation the water exchange between the river channel and the slope cell is calculated based on different over flowing formulae which depend on water levels in the slope and the river as well as levee height conditions as described by sayama et al 2012 the amount of water exchange between the groundwater and the river flow is calculated based on modflow equations as described by brunner et al 2010 for a hydraulically connected system when the water table is above the elevation of the bottom of the riverbed at the slope river cell the amount of water exchanges between the river and the groundwater for the hydraulically disconnected system was set to be zero since surveyed data on the river cross section were not available for this research we used a regression equation reported by coe et al 2008 the geometry of the river channel was assumed to be rectangular and its properties were defined by three parameters i e river width river depth and river embankment height which were estimated based on the empirical function of upstream contributing area a in square km 15 w c w a s w 16 d c d a s d where w denotes width m and d denotes depth m cw sw cd and sd are geometry parameters 3 study area data and model setup 3 1 study area this study selected two river basins located in sri lanka based on the rainfall climatology of the island for the web rri model development and verification the spatial distribution of rainfall climatology in sri lanka is highly variable mainly due to seasonally varying monsoon systems i e southwest and northeast monsoons and their interactions with topography the highlands which are situated in the south central part of the island fig 2 a play an important role as physiographical climatic barriers for generating heterogeneous regional rainfall characteristics throughout the island during the southwest monsoon period i e may to september the southern and western regions receive an ample supply of rainfall 1000 4000 mm whereas the northern and eastern regions receive a very limited amount of rainfall 500 mm due to the shadow effect of the highlands similarly during the northeast monsoon i e december to february the eastern and south eastern regions receive a considerable amount of rainfall 500 1200 mm and the southern and western regions come under the shadow of the highlands department of meteorology sri lanka 2019 as a result the mean annual rainfall in sri lanka varies from under 1200 mm in the dry zone i e from the north western to south eastern regions to over 5000 mm in the wet zone i e the south western region therefore this research has selected two river basins for verifying the model applications in the wet and the dry climatic regions in sri lanka the kalu river basin which is located in the wet zone and receives ample of rainfall 3000 mm year throughout the year and the mundeni river basin which is located mostly in the dry zone and receives moderate rainfall 1400 2000 mm year in less than a half year with a little rain for the rest of the year the model simulations and its verifications in the different climatic conditions will enhance the confidence level of the model applicability under changing climate the characteristics of the basins are summarized in the following sections 3 1 1 the kalu river basin the kalu river basin is located in the south western part of sri lanka fig 2 a and b the main river the kalu river is about 130 km long originating in the central hills about an altitude of 2000 m from msl of the country and discharging into the indian ocean the catchment area of the basin is about 2800 km2 the basin is located in the wet zone 2500 mm year and receives an annual rainfall of 4000 mm on average which is significantly higher compared to other river basins in the country the river discharges about 7000 million cubic meters mcm to the indian ocean every year a run off type power plant with a capacity of 70 mw is installed in the kukule river fig 2 b which is one of the tributaries the basin experiences floods frequently due to heavy rainfall events topographic characteristics steep and flat terrains and demographic situations therefore two administrative districts i e ratnapura and kalutara are severely affected a previous study on this river basin by nandalal 2009 proposed a set of scenarios based on the upstream river discharges to estimate the downstream water levels for disaster early warning therefore developing a web rri model for this basin can contribute for water related disaster early warning flood monitoring forecasting and preparedness activities 3 1 2 the mundeni river basin the mundeni river basin is located in the eastern part of sri lanka fig 2 a and c the longest river segment is about 86 km also originating in the central hills about an altitude of 850 m from msl of the country and discharging into the batticaloa lagoon and the bay of bengal the catchment area of the basin is about 1375 km2 the upstream of the basin receives an annual rainfall of 2000 mm and the downstream of the basin receives an annual rainfall of 1400 mm table 2 the estimated river discharge to the batticalo lagoon and the bay of bengal totals about 900 mcm every year the rugam tank a small reservoir with a capacity of 22 mcm is located in the lower reach of the river as depicted in fig 2 c for facilitating rice cultivation during the dry season april september a new reservoir was constructed during 2007 2013 in upstream of the basin i e rambukan oya dam with a capacity of 56 mcm to cater the needs for drinking water and irrigation in the basin fig 2 c previously yoshimoto and amarnath 2017 developed the rri model to demonstrate flood monitoring applications using satellite rainfall data in this basin their study was limited to flood application and thus did not include the long term basin hydrology due to the limitations in the rri model however their results showed that the simulated hydrographs for the flood events need improvements 3 2 data and model setup 3 2 1 topographic data soil type land use and vegetation data topographic data including digital elevation models

methods to the original srtm data soil type land use and vegetation data influence the generation of surface sub surface and river flows soil type distribution data were obtained from the food and agriculture organization fao at 9 km spatial resolution http www fao org the soil datasets contain soil related parameters including saturated hydraulic conductivity for surface soil layer root zone and groundwater layer saturated soil moisture content residual soil moisture content and van genutchen parameters i e alpha and n the land use data were collected from the united states geological survey usgs global datasets with a spatial resolution of 1 km the sib2 model reclassifies land use or vegetation type data of usgs sellers et al 1996a fig 3 show the spatial distribution of static data such as digital elevation model dem and land use type used in web rri modelling for both basins the sib2 model also requires fraction of photo synthetically active radiation fpar and leaf area

locations throughout the island and river discharge observations by the irrigation department for the kalu river basin study daily rainfall data from 44 stations inside and outside the basin were collected for 1981 2010 fig 2 b shows the locations of the daily rain gauges and their spatial distribution table 1 shows the names and latitudes and longitudes of the rain gauge locations and annual average rainfall amounts mm recorded at each location for the period of 1981 2010 most of the rain gauges particularly the ones in hilly regions are in the premises of the tea and rubber plantation estates for the model calibration and validation of simulated streamflow this research used discharge data which was collected during 1981 1999 at the putupaula station 6 61 n 80 06 e in the lower

of the rain gauge locations and annual average rainfall mm recorded at each location for 1992 2009 for the model calibration and validation of simulated streamflow this research used discharge data collected during 1992 2009 at the tempitiya station 7 62 n 81 44 e located upstream of the rugam tank as shown in fig 2 c the rugam tank does not impact the flow at the tempitiya gauging station as it is located downstream of the gauging point however the newly constructed dam i e rambukan oya dam has impacted the flow condition at the tempitiya gauging stations since 2010 which is out of the selected simulation period i e 1992 2009 for the model validation 3 2 3 japanese reanalysis jra data meteorological forcing inputs for the web rri model such as air temperature wind speed shortwave downward radiation longwave radiation specific humidity and surface pressure were obtained from the japanese 55 year reanalysis jra 55 data the jra 55 data are prepared by the japan meteorological agency jma as a second japanese global atmospheric reanalysis using an advanced data assimilation system and a newly prepared global dataset of past observations the analysis period of jra 55 data covers 55 years from 1958 from the date when regular radiosonde observation began globally it is one of the high quality homogeneous re analysis climate datasets covering the last half century of the entire globe kobayashi et al 2015 the jra 55 data are available at 3 hour temporal resolution and 0 125 spatial resolutions for air temperature wind speed specific humidity and surface pressure and 0 56 spatial resolutions for downward radiations respectively these data were interpolated to model grid resolutions of 450 m and a model temporal resolution of 1 h using a linear interpolation method 3 2 4 evapotranspiration data this research used two independent et datasets to verify the model performance on simulating the et fluxes at a basin scale the selected datasets were from the modis mod16a2 and the global land surface evaporation amsterdam methodology gleam for the period from 2002 to 2009 mod16a2 version 08 is a global product for the terrestrial et and includes evaporation from soil intercepted rainwater by the canopy and the transpiration by vegetation the mod16a2 terrestrial et products were estimated using an improved algorithm by mu et al 2011 the net et products were produced at 8 day temporal resolution and 500 m spatial resolution globally the algorithm for et estimation was formulated on the basis of the penman monteith equation which includes inputs of daily meteorological reanalysis data along with modis remotely sensed data products such as vegetation property dynamics albedo and land cover numerous factors affect remotely observed et estimation and their verification such as the complexity of land surface processes plant biophysics soil properties soil moisture the footprint mismatch between satellite data and ground observations cloud condition

the irrigation department of sri lanka for the 2003 flood event in the kalu river basin however such a dataset was not available for the mudeni river basin and therefore the modis surface reflectance products mod09a1 were utilized to estimate the flood inundation extent mod09a1 version 08 product includes bands from 1 to 7 of modis surface reflectance data at 500 meter spatial and 8 day temporal resolutions in the sinusoidal projection the modified land surface water index mlswi which was proposed by kwak 2017 was employed in this research to obtain the flood inundation extent the mlswi was defined as mlswi 1 r nir r swir 1 r nir r swir where r stands for reflectance values nir stand for near infrared reflectance i e band 2 and swir stands for shortwave infrared reflectance i e band 7 respectively a threshold value of the mlswi 0 6 was chosen to differentiate water cells from other land covers based on their spectral properties 3 3 model discharge evaluation indices mean bias error

wave formulations from the rri model for realistic estimations of water and energy budget processes land atmosphere interactions soil and vegetation water storages and flow amounts and directions for enhancing the model applications to integrated water resources management as well as water related disaster management at a catchment scale this study also investigated the performances of the web rri model in the kalu and mundeni river basins which are located in the wet and dry zones of sri lanka respectively the model performances were evaluated using the available records of observed discharges ground and satellite derived inundation extents and modis and gleam terrestrial et products the results are discussed in the following sections 4 1 comparison of river discharges 4 1 1 model calibration and validation meteorological inputs for the web rri model were prepared for the period of available rainfall observation records i e 1981 2009 for the kalu river basin and 1992 2009 for the mundeni river basin at model grid resolutions the daily rainfall records were interpolated at each model grid using the theisen method and at 1 hour temporal resolution using the uniform distribution method for both basins in the case of the kalu river basin a warm up simulation was set up for the period from 1981 to 1992 to obtain the improved initial conditions for model calibration the discharge data of 1993 at the putuapula gauging point were used for model parameter calibration the validation of calibrated model parameters was conducted using observed discharge data at the same gauging point for 1994 the model performance was evaluated using mbe rmse and nash as described in section 3 3 fig 4 a and b compare the observed daily discharges with the web rri simulated daily discharges from january 1 to december 31 1993 for model calibration and from january 1 to december 31 1994 for model validation in the kalu river basin generally floods in the kalu basin occur during the south west monsoon period may september in 1993 there were two flood peaks at the beginning of june and july during the calibration run the calibrated model parameters are given in table 3 after the calibration of soil and river parameters the model reproduced the hydrological responses of the basin satisfactorily compared to the observed records at the putupaula station with nash equal to 0 94 mbe equal to 7 7 m3 s and rmse equal to 60 m3 s particularly the base flow during the dry period january to may and the peak flow during the wet period were well calibrated in the model for the validation of the soil and river parameters these parameters as shown in table 3 were kept constant the model was used to simulate the basin hydrological responses for 1994 and the results were compared with the observed river discharges at the same location during the validation experiments the results also showed very good agreement with the observed discharges nash 0 92 mbe 11 8 m3 s and rmse 49 m3 s in addition the simulated peak discharges during the flooding periods and the low flows during the dry periods were well reproduced by the web rri model for validation experiments similarly fig 5 a and b compare the observed daily discharges with the web rri simulated daily discharges from june 1 1992 to may 31 1993 for model calibration and from june 1 1993 to may 31 1994 for model validation in the mundeni river basin generally the basin is very dry from march to november for about 7 months the discharge is less than 1 m3 s at the gauging point and the flow in the river starts to rise from the middle of november and reaches its peak at the end of december and becomes dry again in march every year the model was calibrated for the whole one year period including dry and wet spells and the model calibrated parameters are given in table 3 in this basin the performance indices of the web rri model were also very high nash 0 92 mbe 2 17 m3 s and rmse 16 m3 s as shown in fig 5 a the simulation results for the validation of the model parameters were also satisfactory and in very good agreements with the observed discharges nash 0 93 mbe 3 74 m3 s and rmse 17 m3 s as shown in fig 5 b particularly the simulated peak discharges during the wet period were well reproduced by the web rri model for calibration and validation experiments furthermore a long term model validation experiment was conducted by simulating the hydrological responses of the kalu basin for about 20 years and the simulated river discharges were compared with the observed discharges fig 6 a compares the model simulated discharges with the observed discharges at the patupaula gauging station from 1981 to 1999 for 20 years as shown in fig 6 a the model simulated discharges matched the observed discharges during the simulation period and the model performance indices were well estimated i e nash 0 89 mbe 4 7 m3 s rmse 67 m3 s similarly a long term simulation was performed for validating the model simulated hydrological responses of the mundeni river basin from 1992 to 2009 for 17 years the simulated discharges were compared with the observed discharges at the tempitiya gauging point and the results are shown in fig 6 b in the case of the mundeni river basin the long term model simulated river discharges also matched the observed records and the model performance indices were well estimated their values were 0 93 for nash 2 1 m3 s for mbe and 16 m3 s for rmse it could also be noted from fig 6 b that the observed discharges for several years e g 1996 1997 1997 1998 2001 2002 2003 2004 2008 2009 were much less compared to those for other years it also be noted that the period 1997 1998 was a strong el niño year and that 2002 2003 and 2009 2010 were moderate el niño years in addition 1995 1996 was a moderate la niña year and 1998 1999 1999 2000 and 2007 2008 were strong la niña years these initial investigations showed that the warm and cold phases of the el niño southern oscillation commonly called enso in the central and east central equatorial pacific influence the rainfall characteristics and drought conditions of the mundeni river basin whereas there are no such clear differences in the observed river discharges and thus the enso effect was not clearly visible in the kalu river basin during the identified years the wet years in the mundeni river basin with higher discharges 500 m3 s i e 1992 1993 normal year 2000 2001 weak la niña year 2002 2003 moderate el niño year and 2004 2005 weak el niño year showed mixed responses to the enso phenomena further investigations are necessary for the complete understanding of the enso and their influence on the hydro meteorological characteristics in the eastern dry zone of sri lanka 4 1 2 comparison of high flow simulations as described in introduction one of the objectives of the web rri model development is to improve the initial water storages in soil and vegetation and the initial river flow conditions and thereby reduce the effort for the repeated model calibration and improve the simulated flood hydrograph for real time flood monitoring and forecasting applications for the verification of the objectives the simulated high flow events from the model outputs were investigated against observed data in both river basins in the case of the kalu river basin discharge events which exceeded a river discharge of 1000 m3 s i e above the minor flood level at the putupaula station were extracted from the long term simulation results to examine the model performance in each event fig 7 a d compare the extracted observed flood peak discharges with those of the model simulations during 1981 1999 there was a total of four flood peaks that exceeded the limit in 1982 1989 1993 and 1999 as shown in the figure the model simulated peak discharges and their timings matched the observed discharges for all four peak flow cases with nash values greater than 0 84 most importantly the low flows just before the flood events also matched the observed low flows which indicates that the model simulated soil moisture and vegetation storages were reasonably produced just prior to the flooding therefore satisfying one of the requirements for the web rri model development these results showed that the model developed for the kalu river basin well reproduced the hydrological responses of the basin particularly the low flow conditions just before the flood and the peak discharges during the floods therefore the model satisfied the requirements and can be used for real time flood monitoring and forecasting activities i e warm model start up without any further tuning with a great confidence in the simulated results similarly in the case of the mundeni river basin the discharge events which exceeded a river discharge of 400 m3 s at the tempitiya station there are no prescribed flood levels at this station were extracted from the long term simulation and the results were compared with the observed discharges as shown in fig 8 a d there were a total of four cases that exceeded the limit of 400 m3 s in 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 and 2007 as shown in the figure the similar results as obtained for the kalu river basin were obtained for the mundi river basin and the model simulated peak discharges matched the observed discharges for all four peak flow cases with nash values greater than 0 84 in addition the low flows just before the flood events also matched the observed low flows which further confirms good model performance in reliable estimations of soil moisture and vegetation storages and high model applicability to flood peak simulations in the semi arid regions as well as applicability to real time flood monitoring and forecasting activities for simulating flood related disaster risk and damage 4 1 3 comparison of flow regime properties to investigate the overall performance of the web rri model in simulating peak moderate and low flow rates the flow duration curves fdcs were prepared an fdc provides a relationship between a given river discharge rate and the percentage of time that the river discharge rate is equalled or exceeded for a particular watershed vogel and fennessey 1995 fdcs are very useful tools for representing the flow regime s properties for a river basin by exhibiting the entire range of river discharges in log scale from low flows to flood events it has been used for a number of applications in hydrology and water resources management including hydropower water supply irrigation planning and hydrological drought analysis it can also provide information on changes in flow regime in a watershed due to land use and or climate change and therefore reasonable accuracy in reconstructing fdcs from model simulations are required for the model applications for drought and climate change impact assessment studies fig 9 a is an fdc plot at the putupaula station for the period of 1981 1999 for 20 years and fig 9 b is an fdc plot at the tempitiya station in 1992 2009 for 17 years the two figures show very steep gradients visible at the higher end of the observed spectrum 5 time flow equalled or exceeded which indicates the common behaviours of rain caused floods in the small catchments however the gradients below the higher end and in the middle regions differ when compared for both basins the gradient for the kalu river basin is much flatter than that for the mundeni river basin this indicates that the moderate streamflow is sustained throughout the year in the kalu river basin but it is not the case in the mundeni river basin on the other hand the flow regime in the mundeni river basin showed that the low streamflow of 10 m3 s corresponding to the 50 time flow was equalled or exceeded and thus for about a half year the river discharges are less than 10 m3 s in this basin as shown in fig 9 a the reproduction of the simulated fdc is in good agreement with the observed fdc for the entire 20 year period in the kalu river basin the estimated pearson correlation coefficient between observed and simulated discharges was about 0 93 particularly the flow regime between 10 500 m3 s was consistent with the observed flow regime it could also be noted that the model simulated extremely low flow discharges 10 m3 s were slightly higher than the observed values but the exceedance probability corresponding to 10 m3 s was almost 1 these differences are due to water extraction for rural drinking water supply minor irrigation schemes and water accumulation for minor runoff type hydropower generation in the upper streams which are not taken into account for the web rri modelling therefore these results confirmed the better performance of the model for the entire streamflow spectrum in the kalu river basin similarly as shown in fig 9 b the simulated flow regime for the higher end of the spectrum between 100 and 700 m3 s coincided well with the observation for the mundeni river basin the estimated pearson correlation coefficient between observed and simulated discharges was about 0 96 for the entire flow regime however the flow regime simulated to be between 8 100 m3 s showed an underestimation tendency whereas the flow regime simulated to be less than 8 m3 s showed an overestimation tendency as shown in fig 2 b and c the total number of the rain gauges in the kalu river basin was higher 44 locations for 2800 km2 of the catchments area or the rain gauge density is 64 km2 gauge and they were able to capture the heterogeneity in rainfall spatial distribution whereas the total number of the rain gauges in the mundeni river basin was much smaller 4 locations for 1375 km2 of the catchments area or the rain gauge density is 350 km2 gauge and thus they may not be able to capture the heterogeneity in rainfall spatial distribution within the basin particularly in addition to the large scale monsoon and low pressure depression driven rainfall phenomena in the island other phenomena such as small scale convectional rainfall events which occur at a relatively short period of time with higher peaks are more commonly observed in the dry zone it is expected that adding a few more gauges in the upper and middle streams of the basin or combining the gauge data with satellite rainfall estimates can improve the simulation of the basin s hydrological regime between 8 and 100 m3 s in addition the overestimation of the flow regime less than 8 m3 s by the web rri model is due to the water usage for drinking and minor irrigation schemes at the upper stream of the catchment these results showed that the flow regime s properties in both river basins are reasonably reproduced by the web rri model including moderate to low stream flows which indicates that the model is applicable to drought land use and climate change impact assessment studies 4 2 comparison of terrestrial evapotranspiration the accurate estimation of the et component of the water budget in dhm is crucial for simulating accurate soil water storages flood peaks low flows for drought estimation and climate change impacts based on global warming scenarios to investigate the web rri performance in estimating the et component of the water budget two independent et products from the modis and gleam were obtained and processed at a basin scale for both basins the sib2 model is capable of calculating et fluxes individually from four different et components i e soil evaporation evaporation from ground intercepted water evaporation from vegetation intercepted water and transpiration from vegetation this capability of individually simulating each et components is a great advantage and provides an opportunity to investigate changes in land use or irrigation practices under changing climate conditions in the future web rri model application studies to compare the modis net et estimates with the model estimated et fluxes the arithmetic sum of all four et components of the web rri model was calculated and averaged on an 8 day basis at a basin scale the gleam et data was also averaged on an 8 day basis to compare all the products in the same time scale fig 10 a compares the 8 day averaged model simulated et fluxes with the modis observed 8 daily et fluxes and with the 8 day averaged gleam et fluxes the for 8 years 2002 2009 in the kalu river basin the same model which was developed and verified during 1981 1999 in the previous section 4 1 was applied to simulate the basin hydrological characteristics during 2002 2009 the observed discharges during 2000 2009 were under verification due to the detection of changes in the rating curve at the putupaula gauging station in the kalu river basin as shown in fig 10 a the modis as well as gleam et fluctuate between 6 mm day during the wet period and 2 5 mm day during the dry period and the model simulated et fluxes and its trend agreed well with both modis and gleam estimated et fluxes particularly the gleam et flux data showed very good matching in simulating the 8 day trend and its fluctuation with the web rri model outputs compared against the modis et data with the web rri model outputs as a result the model simulated et fluxes showed a relatively higher value for the pearson correlation coefficient r 0 39 with the gleam data as shown in fig 10 c than with the modis et data r 0 14 as shown in fig 10 b in addition the overall model performance indices for the et fluxes also agreed better with the gleam data i e mbe 0 32 mm day and rmse 0 73 mm day than that with the modis data i e mbe 0 33 mm day and rmse 1 04 mm day for the whole period in the kalu river basin similarly fig 11 a is compares estimated and model simulated et fluxes in the mundeni river basin for the same period in this basin the modis as well as the gleam et values fluctuate between 5 mm day during the wet period and 1 5 mm day during the dry period the overall et rates are lower by 1 mm day compared to the et rate in the kalu river basin throughout the period as the mundeni basin is located in the dry zone of sri lanka the estimated et products showed very clear seasonal changes particularly the decreasing trend from march to september and then the increasing trend from september october to february the identified seasonal variation of et fluxes and their values were well simulated by the web rri model and comparable to both reference datasets expect in a few years during the dry period e g 2003 and 2007 in 2003 the model simulated a dry condition i e low et fluxes whereas the both modis and gleam products showed a relatively wet ground condition i e high et fluxes similarly the model also simulated the dry condition in 2007 and during this period modis estimated a moderate dry condition however the gleam products showed a wet condition throughout the period and thus this problem could be due to a retrieval issue in the gleam products the investigation on the observed and simulated river flow conditions during the dry periods in 2003 and 2007 did not find any significant differences and therefore further investigation are needed on the modis and gleam et products rainfall data amount and distributions and model forcing data fig 11 b and c are scatter plots to compare the model simulated et fluxes with the modis and gleam et data for the entire period shown in fig 11 a and the performance indices are shown in the same figures the calculated rmse values for web rri et fluxes were almost same 0 95 for both reference datasets however the correlation coefficient of the web rri model is higher with the gleam products r 0 35 than with modis products r 0 25 the overall performance of the model simulated et fluxes in both basins matched well both modis and gleam data and the estimated performance indices for modis rmse 0 96 1 04 mm day r 0 14 0 25 and gleam rmse 0 73 0 95 mm day r 0 35 0 39 are within the ranges of the reported values in the previous studies which are summarized in section 3 2 4 the identified errors can be attributed to the missing values in modis data during the cloudy period particularly in the kalu river basin biases generated by modis and gleam et retrieval algorithms reanalysis datasets biases in modis lai data biases in meteorological inputs e g rainfall temperature and radiation errors in global land use and soil data and irrigation practices particularly in the mundeni river basin to investigate the model simulated spatial variation of the et fluxes with the modis and the gleam products over the basin the temporal averaging of et fluxes for each grid was performed from 2002 to 2009 and the spatial distributions of et fluxes from the web rri model were compared with modis and gleam fig 12 a c show the spatial distributions of mean et fluxes over the basin during 2002 2009 from the web rri model modis and gleam for the kalu river basin respectively fig 12 d and e show the differences in et fluxes between modis and the web rri model and gleam and web rri model for the same basin respectively the agreement of spatial distribution between the model and modis was quite high due to its high spatial resolution 500 m than gleam 25 km however the calculated differences show that modis overestimated et fluxes at many grid cells compared to gleam data and the values were high 2 mm day whereas the calculated differences for gleam were less than 1 mm day in most of the grids except over the river water cells it could also be noted that the web rri model underestimated the et fluxes over the water cells and along the river paths as shown in fig 12 d and e because the present web rri model treats them as land cells further improvements are needed to upgrade the evaporation component from the water cells similarly fig 13 a c compare the spatial distributions of mean et fluxes over the basin during 2002 2009 from the web rri model modis and gleam for the mundeni river basin respectively as shown in fig 13 b the modis observed et rates are higher in the most upstream part of the basin 4 mm day and are around 2 3 5 mm day in the middle to lower part of the basin due to the variation in the rainfall amount on the other hand the gleam et products showed a uniform distribution of et values that are ranging from 3 mm day to 3 5 mm day in the most of the grids due to its coarser resolution the web rri model simulation results showed that the simulated et rates are in very good agreement in the upstream part of the basin particularly model simulated results with the modis data the hotspots of high et fluxes can be clearly identified due to its fine resolution however when we investigated the differences estimated between the model and the reference data i e modis and gleam in the upstream region as shown in fig 13 d and e the differences were small 1 mm day in both calculations at the same time the model underestimated the et fluxes 1 2 mm day from the middle to lower part of the basin fig 13 d and e most of the underestimations were during the dry period i e may september as it was clearly seen in fig 11 a particularly the simulated et showed larger gaps with two sudden reductions in the et spatial distribution as similar to the interpolated rainfall distributed map by the theisen method not shown in the middle and the lower reaches of the basin as shown in fig 13 a however these unnatural discontinuities were not observed in the kalu basin simulation these larger discontinuities in the mundeni river basin resulted clearly due to limited rainfall observations fig 2 c larger differences in rainfall between the upper and lower reach rainfall gauges as shown in table 2 750 mm year biases generated by interpolated rainfall distributions by the theisen method biases in the recorded rainfall in the middle and lower regions of the basin which did not affect the flow simulations at the tempitiya gauging point trambauer et al 2014 and ramoelo et al 2014 also reported in their studies on validating modis et data that the accuracy of rainfall data was found to be significantly influential on the et amount and distribution a portion of the errors was also attributed to irrigation practices conducted for agricultural activities paddy cultivation in the middle to lower reaches during the dry period more data on rain gauges and irrigation practices data need to be introduced for the better simulation of the et fluxes by the web rri model in the middle to lower reaches during the dry period in this basin in general the model simulated results confirmed that vegetation penology and soil moisture dynamics were reliably incorporated within the model and their effects were reasonably simulated in estimating the et fluxes therefore the web rri model has the potential to estimate et fluxes reasonably well and could be improved further with improved model input data these results further confirm that the web rri model can be implemented for estimating past monitoring present or predicting future agricultural droughts as well as for land use and climate change impact assessment studies 4 3 comparison of inundation extents in all the river basins in sri lanka the duration of the flooding is very short and limited to 3 5 days due to smaller catchment areas in general ground based mapping of flooding is very challenging and costly satellite based mapping is commonly practiced by utilizing space borne sensors such as modis landsat and alos however the availability of satellite observations of past flood events over the kalu river basin was very limited and if available the data only covered a part of the basin or the basin was covered with clouds due to a very active rainfall system that prevails over the basin a major flood event was reported during may 19 21 2003 but the modis surface reflectance data were contaminated by clouds over the entire basin during this period fortunately a ground survey was conducted by the irrigation department of sri lanka for the 2003 may flood event covering the middle to lower parts of the kalu river basin therefore the surveyed flood inundation map of 2003 was obtained from the irrigation department of sri lanka and compared with the model simulated flood extents fig 14 a and b are the maps comparing flood inundation extents from surveyed data by the irrigation department of sri lanka and the simulated maximum flood inundation extents from the web rri model for the 2003 may flood event in the kalu river basin respectively as plotted in fig 14 a most of the observed inundation area was located along the main river of the basin that includes the ratnapura town the upstream area the kalutara town the downstream area as shown in fig 2 b and the in between areas generally the model simulated inundation extents fig 14 b matched the inundation extents surveyed by the irrigation department in addition to the flooding in the main river one of the major tributaries originating from the south and south eastern parts of the basin i e the kuda river also experienced floods during the same period and the model simulated results also produced the inundation extents reasonably well on the other hand the model underestimated the inundation extents in some areas particularly in the most downstream part of the basin and around the river mouth near the indian ocean this underestimation is due to the inaccuracies of satellite dem and the effect of coarse model resolution 500 m as well as the downstream flow discharge condition which is often influenced by the tidal phenomena and shrinkage of the river mouth due to sand deposition the calculated critical success index csi between the field surveyed and model inundation areas as described in section 3 3 was 0 35 the accuracy of the inundation extent can be further improved by incorporating ground based dem or lidar data for flat regions near the coastal belt tidal data and river mouth cross section data in future studies additionally the model also produced inundation information in the most upstream areas of the main river and its remote tributaries this information was not available from the survey records because the surveyed map was prepared for a limited area of the basin using ground truth at specific locations and therefore model outputs are very useful for developing a method for last one mile dissemination of early warning to remote areas in addition to the inundation extents the model can provide crucial information i e inundation depths fig 14 c which is very hard to obtain from remote sensing techniques and field measurements therefore both the model simulated inundation extents and flood depths are crucial information that has great potential for pre and post flood disaster relief rescue and mitigation activities and the results showed that the model produced such information reasonably well for the kalu river basin similarly as described in fig 8 c there was a flood event in the mundeni river basin during december 17 21 2004 though the modis surface reflectance 8 day data were contaminated by clouds during the heavy rainfall events the data collected just after the rainfall event i e during 2004 12 18 to 2004 12 25 were cloud free images and therefore they were processed for flood inundation mapping in this basin fig 15 a and b are the maps that compare the flood inundation extents derived from modis data as described in section 3 2 5 and simulated maximum flood inundation extents from the web rri model for the 2004 flood event in this basin respectively as shown in fig 15 a the modis detected false alarm of inundation areas in the most upstream part and along the southern edge of the basin on the other hand the modis detected inundation areas were located downstream of the tempitiya gauging station as the modis inundation data replicated the 8 day average condition of the land surface condition from december 18 2004 to december 25 2004 the data might have failed to capture the inundations along the river segments in the upstream area before december 18 2004 on the other hand the web rri model driven maximum flood inundation map captured the inundations along the river segments in the upstream area the estimated csi from modis and model inundation extents was about 0 2 for the mundeni basin the reasons for smaller csi are due to limited area coverage by modis time differences between model and observation data and particularly the formulation of csi itself as described in section 3 3 the csi calculation only considers the inundation grids from model and observation and does not consider the matching of non inundation grids for the index calculation in this study there was no overlapping periods where we could find cloud free modis reflectance data and other ground or satellite data for assessing the reliability of modis based flood mapping therefore the flood inundation mapping using modis reflectance data needs to be further investigated and validated using reliable ground based flood mapping data or other satellite data in future studies 5 conclusions dhms have become an essential tool in iwrm particularly due to ever increasing water related disasters dhms with the capability of simulating catchment scale rainfall runoff inundation processes are very informative and effective tools for proactive flood warning flood hazard mapping and flood risk management and assessment however runoff inundation type models used for flood depth and inundation estimations mainly consider the conservation of water balance and overlook several fundamental and critical water energy related parameters and physical processes e g soil moisture canopy interception et and soil vegetation atmosphere interactions with an assumption that their effects can be negligible during a flood event as a result uncertainties in the initial soil and vegetation water storages as well as the estimation of soil moisture canopy interception and et will cause biases in the model simulated outputs which will impact the reliability of simulated flood related parameters and associated flood related risk assessment and thus create the need for additional efforts for repeated event based model calibrations in addition the use of the models for other applications such as drought assessment or iwrm under changing climate becomes questionable since they do not estimate the impact of temperature and et on the water budget explicitly as a result to generate reliable information for supporting decision and policy making on iwrm as well as water related disaster management this study developed a new model the water and energy budget based rri web rri by combining the hydro sib2 model and the rri model s 1 d and 2 d flow equations to incorporate water and energy budget processes land vegetation atmosphere interactions multi layer soil moisture dynamics lateral water flows on the surface and sub surface and in rivers to improve interception et infiltration processes soil moisture runoff and inundation processes the model performance was assessed in the kalu river basin located in the wet zone and the mundeni river basin located in the dry zone of sri lanka the developed models were calibrated and validated for reproducing the observed hydrological responses of the basins at the patupaula station in the kalu river basin and at the tempitiya station in the mundeni river basin respectively the results showed that the nash values obtained from the modelled and observed discharges in both river basins were higher than 0 9 for both calibration and validation experiments a long term validation 1981 to 1999 for the kalu river basin showed that the model simulated discharges matched the observed discharges especially for low and peak flows with high model performance indices nash 0 89 mbe 4 7 m3 s rmse 67 m3 s a long term validation 1992 to 2009 for the mundeni river basin also showed that the model simulated discharges agreed well with the observed discharges and that the model performance indices were well estimated nash 0 93 mbe 2 1 m3 s rmse 16 m3 s in addition the model performance in simulating several peak flow conditions were investigated the model simulated outputs matched the observed peak conditions particularly the simulated low flow just before the flood and the peak flow during the flood as well as their timings coincided well with the observed discharges in both basins which indicates that the model reproduced the soil as well as vegetation storages reasonably well the long term observed and model simulated river discharges were used to construct the fdcs by plotting the complete range of river discharges in log scale from flood events to low flow conditions in order to investigate the model performance in reproducing the flow regime s properties for both river basins in the case of the kalu river basin the simulated flow regime matched the observed flow regime perfectly for the almost entire streamflow spectrum on the other hand in the case of the mundeni river basin though the simulated higher end of the stream flow spectrum agreed very well with the observed one the middle portion was underestimated partly due to the limited number of the rain gauges within the basin in addition the extremely low end of the simulated fdc was overestimated mainly due to water usage for drinking and minor irrigation schemes in the upstream area of the catchment these results from both river basins confirmed that the flow regime s properties can be reasonably reproduced by the web rri model and therefore the model can be used to assess flow regime changes due to land use and climate change scenarios the simulated et fluxes from the web rri were compared with the modis et and the gleam et products during 2002 2009 in general the model simulated et fluxes and its trend agreed well with the gleam et and modis et fluxes particularly the model simulated et fluxes showed a moderate correlation 0 35 0 39 and a low rmse 0 7 0 95 mm day with the gleam et fluxes in both basins whereas they showed a very low correlation 0 14 0 25 and a slightly higher rmse 0 96 1 04 mm day with the modis et fluxes in addition the simulated et rates and their trends matched the et rates obtained from modis and gleam in the both basins underestimations during the dry period i e may to september and two sudden reductions in the spatially distributed et rates were also observed in the mundeni river basin the biases can be attributed to errors in rainfall amount and its distributions the missing values in modis data during the cloudy period particularly in the kalu river basin error generated in the retrieval algorithms of modis and gleam modis lai data meteorological or reanalysis inputs e g temperature and radiation and irrigation practices particularly in the lower reach of the mundeni river basin the model simulated maximum inundation extents were compared with the ground surveyed flood inundation map for the 2003 flood event in the kalu river basin generally the model simulated inundation extents well matched the inundation extents obtained from ground surveyed data modis surface reflectance 8 day data were used to map inundation extents for the 2004 flood event in the mundeni river basin the model simulated inundation extents were comparable with the inundation extents derived from modis data in some areas the model underestimated the inundation extents particularly in the most downstream part of the basin due to the inaccuracies of satellite dem and the effect of coarse resolution 500 m as well as the downstream flow discharge conditions additionally the model produced inundation information in remote areas and provided inundation depth information which is very hard to obtain from remote sensing techniques or field measurements and therefore demonstrated great potential for pre and post flood disaster relief rescue and mitigation activities the accuracy of the inundation extent can be further improved by incorporating ground based dem or lidar data for flat regions near the coastal belt tidal data and river mouth cross section data the model produced inundation information and corresponding water depths in remote areas are very important and can be used for developing a last one mile information dissemination methodology for early warning and rescue operations the web rri model which was developed in this research incorporated all the essential physical formulations for water and energy budget components and land vegetation atmosphere interactions and thus showed good performance in estimating low flows the timing of the flood onset flood peak discharges et and inundation extents in the future this research will focus on expanding the model applicability to generate reliable information for supporting decision and policy making strategies on basin wide iwrm as well as water related disaster management by applying the model to long term simulations such as reproducing and projecting the responses of past and future climatology water cycle variability and hydrological extremes for catchments the research will also include operational applications of the model such as flood forecasting and seasonal prediction in its scope by coupling it with outputs from numerical weather and climate models as well as flood and drought related risk assessment 6 contributions all

6061,the potential impact of shrub expansion on the ecosystem is still under debate in this study we parameterized shrubland in the canadian land surface scheme class as its fifth plant functional type we then used class to simulate the hydrological processes in water stressed shrub covered sites in the us southwest and the mediterranean class overestimates evapotranspiration et and underestimates runoff at the annual time scale rainy season et overestimation is attributable to the overestimation of soil evaporation in the class base run in the mediterranean plant transpiration demonstrates low sensitivity to water stress during dry summers overly early depletion of soil water leads to the consequent underestimation of et at the end of dry seasons in addition the ratio of transpiration to total et is underestimated compared with observations we calibrated the hydrological processes in class accordingly with the aim of reducing soil evaporation which dominates et in the wet seasons and increasing the sensitivity of plant transpiration to water stress the newly introduced parameterization is able to capture well the hydrological dynamics in these four study sites at the monthly time scale still our proposed parameterization for soil evaporation demonstrates high sensitivity to soil composition and needs further calibrations in other regions to guarantee its

rambal 1993 sala and tenhunen 1996 zizka et al 2014 in high latitudes shrub species have expanded into regions which were originally occupied by tundra this invasion into the arctic might be attributable to the combined effects of permafrost thawing more frequent tundra fires and precipitation pattern shifts myers smith et al 2011 lantz et al 2013 despite their continuing expansion in certain ecosystems shrubs influence on the overall biophysical and biochemical processes of ecosystems are still under debate eldridge et al 2011 myers smith et al 2011 2015 among the challenging habitats of shrub species observation shows that these species have been encroaching into previously grass dominated dryland andela et al 2013 which occupies more than 30 of the global land area and has demonstrated the potential for continuous shrub expansion according to climate model predictions huang et al 2016 in addition the encroachment of shrubs could be facilitated by increased water stress in the future jiang et al 2013 it is only recently that researchers have started to introduce shrubs as an individual vegetation category into land models alongside other plant functional types

hydrological processes at four water stressed shrub sites two in the us southwest and two in the mediterranean we parameterize shrubs as dwarf broadleaf trees adapting the existing parameterization of broadleaf trees in class verseghy 2012 here we explore the main physical processes controlling the shrubland hydrology in regions where water availability is the limiting factor class is able to capture well the radiative dynamics in shrubland following the set of parameterizations of broadleaf trees so that the radiative aspect of the simulations is not discussed in this paper in the following sections we focus on explaining the newly introduced modifications based on physical processes specific to water stressed environments which enable class to reproduce the hydrological dynamics at these four study sites we first introduce the study sites and the observation data sets used then we review the parameterizations of radiation and hydrology in the base class model as well as the new hydrological parameterization for water stressed shrubland after that we describe simulations carried out using the base class model as well as the modified version the modifications to class include reducing soil evaporation and increasing plant transpiration s responsiveness to water stress finally we present our discussion and conclusions 2 study sites and data the observational data used here were downloaded from the fluxnet database http fluxnet fluxdata org baldocchi et al 2001 there are about 17 shrub covered sites on the fluxnet website for our study we only chose sites with at least five years of reliable precipitation data that is where the percentage of measured and good quality gap filled precipitation data is at least 70 in each individual year also we only selected shrub covered sites where precipitation is the limiting factor for et excluding sites where et is energy limited only four sites met these two criteria two in the us southwest and two in the mediterranean the study sites characteristics are presented in table 1 and their geographical distribution is shown in fig 1 the topography of the four sites is relatively flat the soil is sandy loam in the us southwest and silty clay in the mediterranean more than 60 of the annual precipitation and more than 50 of the annual et take place during the summers at the two us southwest sites and runoff is negligible there at the mediterranean sites although more than 70 of the annual precipitation occurs outside of the summer period less than 50 of et takes place during the rainy season the rest of the et happens during the dry summers the es lju site overlies karst limestone and more than 50 of the precipitation infiltrates into the soil column as recharge to local groundwater in its rainy season cantón et al 2010 li et al 2011 the it noe site is underlain by limestone and intense rainfall causes overland flow in the fall seasons marras et al 2011 the observed soil depth at the it noe site is also the shallowest the fluxnet data used here include the required meteorological forcing data for running class offline and the observed surface flux data the meteorological forcing data are a combination of observations gap filled data using the marginal distribution sampling mds method reichstein et al 2005 and data downscaled from era interim reanalysis de biased data following vuichard and papale 2015 where applicable latent and sensible heat fluxes represent observational data gap filled using the mds method reichstein et al 2005 to achieve a better energy balance closure we used energy balance corrected versions of the latent and sensible heat fluxes which are adjusted by assuming that the bowen ratio is accurate http fluxnet fluxdata org data fluxnet2015 dataset data processing table 2 shows the diagnosis of land surface radiative and energy balance closure for these four sites during the comparison periods here we define net shortwave radiation net longwave radiation net radiation that is sw lw netrad as the radiative imbalance and net radiation latent heat sensible heat ground heat that is netrad lh sh g as the land surface energy imbalance the magnitudes of the imbalances are small compared with those of the component fluxes except for the ground heat flux the fluxnet database also provides photosynthesis related variables such as net ecosystem exchange nee gross primary production gpp and ecosystem respiration reco daytime nee is modelled as a function of gpp and reco according to lasslop et al 2010 following scott and biederman 2017 here we used the ratio of gpp and et at the monthly scale defined as water use efficiency wue to derive monthly soil evaporation for the us whs site and the details are explained in section 4 1 3 introduction to the canadian land surface scheme class when run in offline mode or in equilibrium climate mode class is used with prescribed vegetation coverage alongside class the canadian terrestrial ecosystem model ctem has been developed to account for dynamic vegetation which simulates vegetation morphological dynamics plant structure and coverage changes ecosystem carbon dynamics in live plant leaves stems and roots as well as in dead carbon pools i e litter detritus and soil carbon and plants establishment survival competition with other species and mortality melton and arora 2016 in this study the dynamic vegetation option provided by ctem is turned off when this is done background vegetation parameters such as vegetation height and coverage rooting depth albedo transmissivity mass and maximum and minimum pai must be specified for each study site via an initialization file plant seasonality is regulated by a growth index determined by the air temperature and the top soil layer temperature together this growth index controls woody plants spring budburst from dormant to fully leafed maturity and fall senescence from fully leafed to leafless 3 1 composite method in class each grid cell can contain up to four subareas representing bare soil snow over bare soil vegetation over soil and vegetation over snow for each subarea the parameters representing land surface properties i e albedo transmissivity roughness length etc are computed separately for the two vegetated subareas vegetation over soil and vegetation over snow pai across the five plant functional types broadleaf tree needleleaf tree crop grass and shrub is averaged according to their individual fractional coverages in order to derive the overall pai of one composite vegetation class simulates land radiative and hydrological dynamics separately for these four subareas at the end of each time step the land prognostic variables are averaged across these four subareas in this study we carried out offline class runs with prescribed atmospheric forcing which includes incoming shortwave radiation incoming longwave radiation air temperature specific humidity wind speed precipitation and surface pressure in this way we provided the background meteorological states for land thermal and hydrological dynamics in the following paragraphs we explain both the thermal and hydrological parameterizations in the base class model following verseghy 2012 as well as our newly introduced modifications to accommodate the hydrological processes in water stressed environments 3 2 thermal dynamics incoming shortwave radiation is the primary energy source for thermal dynamics inside the canopy snow pack and soil column the top soil layer absorbs solar energy and emits longwave radiation as well as exchanging energy with the overlying air through sensible and latent heat fluxes all soil layers experience moisture phase change as well as internal energy change caused by soil heat conduction and or soil water mass loss gain the shortwave radiation absorbed by the canopy and snow pack is balanced by vegetation snow longwave radiation sensible and latent heat fluxes water phase change and internal energy storage 3 3 hydrological dynamics precipitation is the driver of land hydrological processes in class when precipitation occurs rain or snow is intercepted by the canopy or falls onto the ground intercepted water on the canopy either falls onto the surface as throughfall or evaporates back to the air as vegetation evaporation water over land can either evaporate directly back to the atmosphere or infiltrate down into the soil column inside the soil column infiltrated water moves in response to gravity suction or infiltration forces in the model after infiltration or direct evaporation back to the air excess water either ponds on the surface or turns into surface runoff if the depth of the ponded water exceeds its maximum value water in the first soil layer is the source of both soil evaporation and plant transpiration vegetation is able to access water in soil layers as long as the roots can reach these layers water draining out of the bottom of the soil column is defined as baseflow the hydraulic conductivity at the bottom is multiplied by a drainage parameter dependent on the site characteristics if the soil column is situated on top of an impermeable layer e g a bog the drainage parameter is set to zero and there will be no baseflow if free drainage can happen the drainage parameter is set to 1 the value of the drainage parameter can vary between these two end states in all our tests the drainage parameters are set to 1 total et is comprised of soil evaporation plant evaporation and plant transpiration in this study soil evaporation and plant transpiration are the two dominant components because of the relatively low leaf areas vegetation evaporation from intercepted water is small compared with transpiration and soil evaporation and so its effect can be neglected 3 3 1 soil evaporation 3 3 1 1 soil evaporation parameterization in the base class model soil evaporation is the sum of evaporation from bare soil and from soil under the canopy evaporation from bare soil is parameterized on the basis of atmospheric demand and an evaporation efficiency parameter β calculated according to lee and pielke 1992 with the available water of the first soil layer as the upper limit the theoretical bare soil surface evaporation rate e 0 m m s 1 is calculated as 1 e 0 ρ a c dh v a q 0 q a in eq 1 ρ a is the density of air k g m 3 q 0 and q a are the specific humidity at the surface and at the reference height k g k g 1 c dh is the surface drag coefficient for evaporation determined by the atmospheric state and v a is the wind speed at a reference height m s 1 surface specific humidity q 0 is parameterized as β q 0 sat 1 β q a with q 0 sat as the saturated specific humidity at the surface k g k g 1 the soil evaporation efficiency β is determined by the saturation state of the top soil layer as 2 β 0 25 1 c o s θ 1 π θ fc 2 in eq 2 θ 1 is the liquid water content of the first soil layer m 3 m 3 and θ fc is its field capacity m 3 m 3 when the water content of the first soil layer is above or at field capacity the soil evaporation efficiency stays at 1 0 when the water content drops below the wilting point the evaporation efficiency is set to zero in the subarea of vegetation over soil evaporation from soil underneath the canopy e 0 c m m s 1 is parameterized as 3 e 0 c ρ a q 0 q a c r a g in eq 3 q a c is the specific humidity of the canopy air k g k g 1 and 1 r a g m s 1 follows the analysis of deardorff 1972 as 4 1 r a g 1 9 10 3 t 0 v t ac v 1 3 in eq 4 t 0 v and t ac v are the virtual potential temperature of the surface and the canopy air with units k for bare soil the maximum surface evaporation rate e 0 max m m s 1 is set to the sum of any surface ponded water present and available liquid water in the top soil layer 5 e 0 max ρ w z p θ 1 θ r δ z 1 δ t in eq 5 ρ w is the density of water k g m 3 z p is the depth of surface ponded water θ 1 and θ r are the first soil layer volumetric water content and minimum residual soil liquid water content m 3 m 3 δ z 1 is the first soil layer depth 10 c m and δ t is the time interval for soil under vegetation the maximum surface evaporation rate e 0 max c m m s 1 is set equal to the extractable moisture of the first soil layer and it is parameterized as 6 e 0 max c ρ w θ 1 θ r δ z δ t in both eqs 5 and 6 the minimum residual soil liquid water content θ r is set to be 0 04 m 3 m 3 in class at each time step the top soil layer evaporation rate as defined in eqs 1 and 3 is constrained to be less than or equal to the soil evaporation limits defined in eqs 5 and 6 3 3 1 2 soil evaporation parameterization for water stressed environments the parameterization of soil evaporation in the base class model is more general than that in lee and pielke 1992 taking into account the available water of the top soil layer however the parameterization of lee and pielke is derived based on pan experiments kondo et al 1990 and the variation of soil structure and hydrological properties in natural conditions might affect the results in the following part we proposed soil evaporation parameterization to take account the hydrological impacts from soil physical sealing and or a biological crust layer the formation of a seal or crust on bare soil is a common phenomenon in arid areas it can act to reduce soil evaporation and preserve more water inside the soil column sela et al 2015 assouline 2004 a biological crust layer is a thin soil layer formed by soil particles and cyanobacteira green algae microfungi bacteria lichens and bryophytes together belnap 2006 observations show that the biological crust layer can increase the upper soil water holding capacity and reduce soil evaporation especially when the surface soil water content is high cantón et al 2004 chamizo et al 2012 2016 xiao et al 2010 in addition observation studies show that rainfall infiltration rates in the vegetation patches are higher than in the intervening bare soil in dryland katra et al 2007 wang et al 2013 due to the higher level of aggregation developed by root growth and polysaccharides production bochet et al 1999 sarah and rodeh 2004 local microtopography can cause surface water to be channeled from crusted bare soil areas toward vegetation patches for infiltration which will further increase the available soil water for plant transpiration chen et al 2013 rodríguez caballero et al 2018 in water stressed sites the surface evaporation is soil moisture limited therefore in this study our modifications to soil evaporation are achieved by limiting the available soil water here for simplicity we used the same limiting factor for bare soil and for soil under vegetation for each individual site for all test runs presented in the following sections we scaled down e 0 max and e 0 max c by a factor r surf adapted from sellers et al 1992 which increases exponentially as the top soil layer dries for the two us sites we used essentially the same formulation as r surf e x p 8 206 4 255 θ 1 θ fc where θ 1 m 3 m 3 is the top soil layer volumetric water content and θ fc m 3 m 3 is its field capacity for the two mediterranean sites we found it necessary to change the second coefficient from 4 255 to 1 0 in order to achieve the best fit with observations r surf e x p 8 206 1 0 θ 1 θ fc the soil compositions at the two sandy us sites are more consistent with the study region in sellers et al 1992 therefore its r surf factor is readily applicable there however the higher clay contents at the es lju and it noe sites required adjustment of the coefficient to account for the higher soil evaporation resistance merlin et al 2016 the shapes of the two curves are illustrated in fig 2 the factor r surf is then used to reduce soil evaporation and conserve more water inside the soil as shown in eqs 7 and 8 7 e 0 max d r y e 0 max r surf 8 e 0 max d r y c e 0 max c r surf here the proposed parameterization efficiently reduces the overestimation of soil evaporation however soil compositions at these two sandy us sites or the two clayey mediterranean sites are not widely different which prevents us from deriving a more general r surf factor for either sandy or clayey regions 3 3 2 vegetation transpiration parameterization in class the vegetation transpiration flux e c m m s is parameterized according to garratt 1992 as 9 e c ρ a q c q a c r b r c in eq 9 q c is the saturated specific humidity at the canopy temperature k g k g 1 q a c is the specific humidity of the canopy air k g k g 1 r b is the boundary layer resistance s m 1 and r c is the stomatal resistance s m 1 in our study evaporation from intercepted water is small compared with transpiration because of the relatively low leaf areas and so its effect can be neglected water for plant transpiration is drawn from soil layers with water contents higher than the minimum residual soil liquid water content θ r 0 04 m 3 m 3 according to the relative mass of roots in each layer 3 3 3 stomatal resistance 3 3 3 1 stomatal resistance parameterization in the base class model in class the stomatal resistance of vegetation is regulated by vapour pressure deficit δ e soil moisture suction ψ s and air temperature t a fig 3 shows graphically these functional relationships i e f δ e f ψ s and f t a the effect of δ e on stomatal resistance is expressed as oren et al 1999 wu et al 2000 10 f δ e δ e 10 0 c v 2 c v 1 as soil layers dry the soil moisture suction increases the effect of soil wetness on stomatal resistance is determined by the soil moisture suction of the wettest layer ψ s choudhury and idso 1985 fischer et al 1981 11 f ψ s 1 ψ s c ψ 1 c ψ 2 in eqs 10 and 11 c v 1 c v 2 and c ψ 1 c ψ 2 are constants dependent on plant functional type pft for all five pfts in class the air temperature only impacts stomatal resistance when it lies outside the 5 c 40 c range the effect of air temperature on stomatal resistance is expressed via piecewise functions as 12 f t a 250 w h e n t a 5 c t a 50 c 13 f t a 1 1 0 1 5 t a w h e n 5 c t a 5 c 14 f t a 1 1 0 1 40 t a w h e n 40 c t a 50 c 15 f t a 1 w h e n 5 c t a 40 c the resulting combined effect on the overall stomatal resistance r c as a result of vapour pressure deficit air temperature and soil aridity is obtained as their product 16 r c f t a f δ e f ψ s r c u in eq 16 r c u is the unstressed stomatal resistance under the ambient incoming visible shortwave radiation 3 3 3 2 stomatal resistance parameterization for water stressed environments in order to increase the responsiveness of shrub species to water stress we use the soil moisture suction of the top soil layer ψ 1 to determine the impact on stomatal resistance that is eq 11 is modified as follows 17 f ψ 1 1 ψ 1 c ψ 1 c ψ 2 the differences between f ψ 1 defined in eq 17 and f ψ s defined in eq 11 are shown in fig 4 it can be seen that f ψ 1 is more responsive in time to soil moisture variations 3 4 root distribution 3 4 1 root distribution parameterization in the base class model in class root density decreases exponentially with depth feddes et al 1974 within a given soil layer the root fraction is calculated as 18 r δ z e x p 3 0 z t e x p 3 0 z b 1 e x p 3 0 z r in eq 18 z t is the depth of the soil layer top z b is the depth of the soil layer bottom and z r is the overall rooting depth the total fraction of roots in each soil layer across the five plant functional types the effective root density is determined as a weighted average over these five vegetation categories at each time step the effective root density in each soil layer is scaled up or down according to the relative aridity of that specific layer that is the root fraction is weighted by the relative soil moisture suction ψ w ψ i ψ w ψ sat where ψ w and ψ sat are the soil moisture suction at the wilting and saturation points and ψ i is the soil moisture suction at the current time step then the root density is re normalized by the sum of the new root density of all layers this enables the vegetation to extract water preferentially from the wettest soil layer regardless of its depth the shrub rooting depth is assigned an assumed default value of 1 0 m in all of the class experiments below except in tests for the it noe site where it is set to the observed soil depth of 0 40 m 3 5 plant seasonality 3 5 1 plant seasonality parameterization in the base class model in the base class model plant seasonality is regulated by a growth index which is determined by the air temperature and the first layer soil temperature the growth index b is 1 for fully leaved mature vegetation and zero for leafless or dormant plants the transitions between these two stages are linear and last for 30 days for woody species at each time step the growth index increases if both the air temperature and the first layer soil temperature are above 2 c when either the air temperature or the first layer soil temperature drops below 2 c at the end of the fully leaved period the growth index of the woody plants is decreased by the increment for each time step until it is reduced to zero this parameterization of woody plant seasonality was primarily derived for representing plant species in high latitudes where temperature is the limiting factor for vegetation growth at each time step the pai varies between pai max and pai min the maximum and minimum values specified in the initialization file as 19 pai pai min pai max pai min b 3 5 2 plant seasonality parameterization for water stressed environments as our study sites are located in dryland areas where water availability is the primary limiting factor for plant growth in the tests presented below we added the relative wetness of the top soil layer w as a second controlling factor for pai variation defined as 20 w ψ w 1 ψ 1 ψ w 1 ψ sat 1 in eq 20 ψ w 1 m is the top layer soil moisture suction at the wilting point 150 m and ψ sat 1 m is the top layer soil moisture suction at saturation ψ sat 1 is calculated from the sand content of the top soil layer x sand as ψ sat 0 01 e x p 0 0302 x sand 4 33 according to cosby et al 1984 ψ 1 is the soil moisture suction of the top soil layer at the current time step parameterized as 21 ψ 1 ψ sat 1 θ 1 θ p 1 b in eq 21 θ 1 is the top soil layer volumetric water content m 3 m 3 and θ p 1 is the pore volume m 3 m 3 determined by the sand content of the soil layer θ p 1 0 126 x sand 48 9 100 b is a constant determined by the clay content of the soil layer b 0 159 x clay 2 91 clapp and hornberger 1978 at each time step pai responds to water stress in addition to temperature stress as 22 pai pai min pai max pai min b w thus pai is equal to pai max when the top soil layer is at saturation and decreases as the top soil layer dries when the top layer soil moisture suction increases to its wilting point ψ w 1 w is equal to zero we set the pai min as 1 0 to avoid numerical instabilities after deriving pai at each time step the active leaf area index ail of the shrubs is parameterized as ail p a i pai min with this approach leaves at the two mediterranean sites remain active whenever the top soil layer is moist and so they respond immediately as soon as rainfall begins again in the autumn however according to observations dryland shrub species become relatively dormant after experiencing active leaf development for about five months kurc and benton 2010 for the us src site morillas et al 2013 for the es lju site reichstein et al 2003 for the it noe site scott and biederman 2017 for the us whs site to incorporate this observed plant phenology we also introduce a minimum 6 month leaf dormancy function following previous studies bonan et al 2003 zeng 2010 that is the pai is arbitrarily reduced to be 20 of the computed pai outside of the active growing season i e from april to september for the us src and us whs sites and from february to july for the es lju and it noe sites the overall differences between the base class parameterization and our modified pai parameterization are shown in fig 5 4 results 4 1 transpiration ratio at study sites fig 6 shows observed monthly precipitation et and gpp for the four study sites averaged across the comparison periods listed in table 1 the seasonality of precipitation and et is in phase at the two us sites and is out of phase at the two mediterranean sites the gpp seasonal variation follows that of et at the us src site gpp peaks in the spring and summer after rainfalls accompanied by a steep plunge in june related to late spring drought at the es lju and it noe sites the gpp peaks in may following the accumulation of spring rainfall and its decrease starts in june in this study water use efficiency wue is defined as the ratio of gpp to et at the monthly time scale following scott and biederman 2017 studies show that wue stays constant at the annual and monthly time scale when transpiration dominates et scott et al 2015 scott and biederman 2017 an implicit assumption of this method is that gpp from transpiring leaf and stem components dominates overall gpp therefore this method might not be applicable at the two mediterranean sites where root development constitutes a significant portion of gpp during the summer droughts lloret et al 1999 padilla et al 2009 we applied this relationship to derive the bare ground evaporation for the us whs site from july to october across the comparison period fig 7 shows monthly et versus gpp with different colors representing different months for each individual month the y axis intercept represents the average soil evaporation scott and biederman 2017 the slopes of the et gpp lines are mostly consistent from july to october with decreasing y axis intercepts indicating that wue remains constant while bare soil evaporation decreases from july to october scott and biederman 2017 the transpiration ratio for us whs summers during the comparison period is derived as 49 this method is not applicable at the us src site because of its low transpiration in its rainy season with only 24 vegetation coverage observations show that annual transpiration is only 42 of et in 2008 with precipitation as high as 461 mm year cavanaugh et al 2011 this site is much drier from 2009 to 2012 with annual precipitation varying from 194 mm to 333 mm with less intense rainfall events happening in the rainy season rain water is less likely to infiltrate into deeper soil layers water in the shallower soil layers favors soil evaporation instead of plant transpiration cavanaugh et al 2011 thus the transpiration is likely less than 42 of et for the 2009 2012 comparison period previous studies indicate that underground root growth contributes a significant portion of gpp in the mediterranean there precipitation varies greatly from year to year fluctuating from 182 mm to 1143 mm at the es lju site and from 433 mm to 844 mm at the it noe site accordingly the available soil water for et at any given soil depth also varies greatly during summers plants cope with water shortage by reducing their active leaf area and increasing stomatal resistance to restrain et and or by extending roots to access more water adiku et al 2000 poole et al 1981 quevedo and francés 2008 rambal 1993 reichstein et al 2003 sala and tenhunen 1996 thus wue can increase in drier years as less gpp is allocated to leaves and stems and more is allocated to the rooting system reduced leaf and stem gpp are likely to cause transpiration reduction and therefore et reduction meanwhile enhanced gpp of the rooting system enables plants to access water to sustain their survival by lateral root spreading and taproot lengthening for example during the 2003 drought in europe shrubs in pianosa italy were able to achieve the same gpp level as that in 2002 with reduced et fig 8 reichstein et al 2007 indicating a higher wue at the two mediterranean sites rainfall occurs mainly in the spring fall and winter when the evaporation demand is lower than that in summer therefore precipitation is able to penetrate deeper to provide soil moisture recharge for the rainless summers as noted in section 2 the es lju site overlies karst limestone bedrock and shrub species are able to extract soil water stored inside cracks fissures and pipes of bedrock to maintain relatively high et rates when the top soil layer dries up in the summer cantón et al 2010 domingo et al 1999 thus plant transpiration contributes a large portion of et from may to august also as noted above the it noe site is underlain by relatively shallow limestone bedrock fig 6 shows that there et again exceeds precipitation from april till august indicating that et is supplied from deep layer soil water stored during the rainy seasons in short transpiration ratios in these two mediterranean sites are likely to be high during summer drought when more than 50 of annual et takes place at that time soil evaporation is likely to constitute a relatively small portion of et note that even though shrub species manage to survive on water from deeper soil layers in dry months we still parameterize stomatal resistance according to the wetness of the top soil layer to efficiently pass on the water stress to plant transpiration during summer months observations show that in the mediterranean region even at shrub sites with higher precipitation root water uptake still responds to drought pressure in relatively dry summers rambal 1984 in addition growth maintenance and nutrient intake by the deeper roots require more energy compared with these by the shallow roots schenk and jackson 2002 2005 which could work as another constraint in terms of efficient deep root development and functioning compared with the shallow rooting system 4 2 overview of base runs and test runs we used a multi year set of atmospheric forcings to run class for 8 cycles and then compared the simulation from the last cycle with observations for example in the case of the us src site where data are available from 2008 to 2012 we repeated this 5 year period of meteorological forcing to run class 7 times assuming that we had then achieved an equilibrium state over land we used the same period of atmospheric forcing to run class an 8th time from the 8th cycle we only used the simulation results from years 2009 to 2012 in order to avoid any spurious effects caused by the discontinuity between the end of 2012 and the beginning of 2008 table 3 summarizes the base runs and the test runs the base runs were carried out using the standard class formulations and the test runs successively incorporated the modifications described in the above sections to accommodate water stressed shrub environments in test 1 we introduced the adjustment to e 0 max and e 0 max c described in section 3 3 1 2 aimed at reducing soil evaporation to take into account the combined effect of a thin impermeable surface layer and the preferential rainwater infiltration in vegetation patches as well as the favorable runoff reallocation toward the vegetation patches because of the empirical nature of our proposed parameterization its physical implications need further support from observation studies this test led to exacerbation of the transpiration overestimation in the mediterranean sites due to the increased soil water content whereupon we separately added the water limitation factor on pai presented in section 3 5 2 to produce test 2 and the modifications to f ψ s described in section 3 3 3 2 to produce test 3 in order to demonstrate their impacts on plant transpiration individually the combined influence of all these modifications on the hydrological processes is shown in test 4 4 3 comparison between base runs and observations fig 8 shows the comparison between observed and simulated et and its components in the base class run at the monthly time scale evaporation from intercepted water on vegetation is small and is not included here the black solid lines represent the observed monthly et and the gray shaded region represents one standard deviation of et across comparison years for the us src and us whs sites class is able to capture the et seasonality however et is underestimated in the late spring before the soil is replenished by summer rainfalls during the rainy seasons plant transpiration only contributes 18 of et at us src which is much lower than the observed value of 42 cavanaugh et al 2011 at the us whs site the modelled transpiration is 25 of et for the period of july through october and is likewise lower than both the observed value of 58 scott et al 2006 and our derived value of 49 in fig 7 in these simulations with the base class model soil evaporation is the largest component of et constituting 80 at us src and 72 at us whs in the summer rainy season table 4 compared with the two us southwest sites the discrepancies between simulated and observed et at the two mediterranean sites are caused by both soil evaporation overestimation in the rainy season and plant transpiration overestimation underestimation during the summer drought at the es lju site the simulated et peaks in april which is one month earlier than the observation this early peak is attributable to the overestimation of soil evaporation soil evaporation also contributes to an overestimation of et from october to december the higher than observed soil evaporation in the rainy season is partly caused by the lack of representation of local characteristics including developed karst and denuded surface soil which all facilitate the rapid infiltration of water cantón et al 2010 li et al 2011 at the it noe site the simulated et peaks in march while the observed et peaks in may the most severe et underestimation ranges from july to august soil evaporation dominates et for most of the year 4 4 comparison between test runs and observations the comparison between et and its components from test 1 to test 4 and the observations at the monthly time scale is shown in fig 9 at the two us southwest sites the increased plant responsiveness to water stress in test 2 test 3 and test 4 does not improve et significantly after soil evaporation is reduced in test 1 the only exception is in the late spring at us src when the enhanced sensitivity of f ψ s to water stress helps reduce plant transpiration caused by the higher soil water content compared with the slight et underestimation during the us whs rainy summers summer et underestimation at the us src site is more severe the underestimation of et during the us src summer might be caused by the fact that vegetation coverage at this site is not high enough to channel water into the soil column as efficiently as in the more densely vegetated us whs site therefore the sparsely vegetated us src site tends to generate higher soil evaporation during the rainy season at the two mediterranean sites the overestimation of summer plant transpiration is more efficiently addressed by the modification of the f ψ s factor in test 3 than by the modification of the pai factor in test 2 the improved et seasonality at the es lju site in test 4 is due to the reduced soil evaporation in the rainy season and enhanced responsiveness of plant transpiration to water stress in dry spells the es lju site is characterized by dolines fissured and fractured outcrops as well as denuded soil which all facilitate rapid infiltration cantón et al 2010 li et al 2011 therefore observed et in the autumn rainy season is still lower than in the class simulation during summer droughts class underestimates et slightly as the summer water stress can be alleviated to some degree by the plants extraction of soil water stored inside the karst limestone bedrock cantón et al 2010 at the it noe site the overestimation of et during the rainy season is reduced in the test runs however et is still underestimated during the summer droughts the higher observed et might be attributable to lateral root expansion and or the sporadic deep soil patches deeper than 0 4 m which are not represented in the class physics 5 conclusion and discussion in this study we have implemented shrubs as the new fifth plant functional type in class and have simulated the hydrological processes in four shrub covered areas under water stress with two in the us southwest and two in the mediterranean we modified class to accommodate water limited shrublands and capture their seasonal et variation for this purpose we scaled down the maximum soil evaporation and prioritized the first soil layer water content as the primary controlling factor for variation of shrub stomatal resistance and pai in this way we reduced soil evaporation and increased the sensitivity of plant transpiration to water shortage especially in the mediterranean regions where shrubs have to endure long summer droughts this work represents the first in depth assessment of the ability of class to simulate hydrological processes in water stressed environments where et is restricted by available soil water instead of primarily by available energy as in mid and high latitudes the modifications that we have made to the class code will be easy to implement operationally through changes to the initialization files and the introduction of switches based on the presence or absence of shrubs further refinement of our work would require more comprehensive long term measurements of soil moisture at various soil depths compared with variations in pai and et which are not routinely made in addition the applicability of our proposed two sets of soil evaporation reduction factors r surf is constrained by the similarity of the soil composition at the two sandy us sites and the two clayey mediterranean sites in our study we would need data from regions with substantially different soil compositions to derive a more general parameterization of the soil evaporation reduction factor merlin et al 2016 2018 given the limitations of the currently available data we consider that this work represents a significant enhancement to class in our study all sites are situated on flat terrain and each fluxnet site only represents about 1 3 km2 spatially running et al 1999 in dryland with relatively sparse vegetation coverage both soil evaporation and plant transpiration are mostly determined by soil moisture availability which is highly heterogeneous at the spatial scale the hydrological impacts of shrub species on the local water budget can be quite different even within short distances e g poole et al 1981 the applicability of our current parameterizations over larger scales will depend on how well class is able to represent different soil layers contribution to et in areas where soil moisture is the limiting factor in addition geomorphological factors like the slope and the orientation of topography also play important roles in et variation and their impacts should be evaluated the spatial applicability of our work will be explored in the future our study focuses on the shrubland hydrology where water is the limiting factor for the hydrological processes when comes to simulating shrubland s hydrology where radiation is the limiting factor for et for example in the high latitude regions special attention would shift to shrub species impacts on the radiative processes over land dornes et al 2008 marsh et al 2010 declaration of competing

6061,the potential impact of shrub expansion on the ecosystem is still under debate in this study we parameterized shrubland in the canadian land surface scheme class as its fifth plant functional type we then used class to simulate the hydrological processes in water stressed shrub covered sites in the us southwest and the mediterranean class overestimates evapotranspiration et and underestimates runoff at the annual time scale rainy season et overestimation is attributable to the overestimation of soil evaporation in the class base run in the mediterranean plant transpiration demonstrates low sensitivity to water stress during dry summers overly early depletion of soil water leads to the consequent underestimation of et at the end of dry seasons in addition the ratio of transpiration to total et is underestimated compared with observations we calibrated the hydrological processes in class accordingly with the aim of reducing soil evaporation which dominates et in the wet seasons and increasing the sensitivity of plant transpiration to water stress the newly introduced parameterization is able to capture well the hydrological dynamics in these four study sites at the monthly time scale still our proposed parameterization for soil evaporation demonstrates high sensitivity to soil composition and needs further calibrations in other regions to guarantee its

hydrological processes at four water stressed shrub sites two in the us southwest and two in the mediterranean we parameterize shrubs as dwarf broadleaf trees adapting the existing parameterization of broadleaf trees in class verseghy 2012 here we explore the main physical processes controlling the shrubland hydrology in regions where water availability is the limiting factor class is able to capture well the radiative dynamics in shrubland following the set of parameterizations of broadleaf trees so that the radiative aspect of the simulations is not discussed in this paper in the following sections we focus on explaining the newly introduced modifications based on physical processes specific to water stressed environments which enable class to reproduce the hydrological dynamics at these four study sites we first introduce the study sites and the observation data sets used then we review the parameterizations of radiation and hydrology in the base class model as well as the new hydrological parameterization for water stressed shrubland after that we describe simulations carried out using the base class model as well as the modified version the modifications to class include reducing soil evaporation and increasing plant transpiration s responsiveness to water stress finally we present our discussion and conclusions 2 study sites and data the observational data used here were downloaded from the fluxnet database http fluxnet fluxdata org baldocchi et al 2001 there are about 17 shrub covered sites on the fluxnet website for our study we only chose sites with at least five years of reliable precipitation data that is where the percentage of measured and good quality gap filled precipitation data is at least 70 in each individual year also we only selected shrub covered sites where precipitation is the limiting factor for et excluding sites where et is energy limited only four sites met these two criteria two in the us southwest and two in the mediterranean the study sites characteristics are presented in table 1 and their geographical distribution is shown in fig 1 the topography of the four sites is relatively flat the soil is sandy loam in the us southwest and silty clay in the mediterranean more than 60 of the annual precipitation and more than 50 of the annual et take place during the summers at the two us southwest sites and runoff is negligible there at the mediterranean sites although more than 70 of the annual precipitation occurs outside of the summer period less than 50 of et takes place during the rainy season the rest of the et happens during the dry summers the es lju site overlies karst limestone and more than 50 of the precipitation infiltrates into the soil column as recharge to local groundwater in its rainy season cantón et al 2010 li et al 2011 the it noe site is underlain by limestone and intense rainfall causes overland flow in the fall seasons marras et al 2011 the observed soil depth at the it noe site is also the shallowest the fluxnet data used here include the required meteorological forcing data for running class offline and the observed surface flux data the meteorological forcing data are a combination of observations gap filled data using the marginal distribution sampling mds method reichstein et al 2005 and data downscaled from era interim reanalysis de biased data following vuichard and papale 2015 where applicable latent and sensible heat fluxes represent observational data gap filled using the mds method reichstein et al 2005 to achieve a better energy balance closure we used energy balance corrected versions of the latent and sensible heat fluxes which are adjusted by assuming that the bowen ratio is accurate http fluxnet fluxdata org data fluxnet2015 dataset data processing table 2 shows the diagnosis of land surface radiative and energy balance closure for these four sites during the comparison periods here we define net shortwave radiation net longwave radiation net radiation that is sw lw netrad as the radiative imbalance and net radiation latent heat sensible heat ground heat that is netrad lh sh g as the land surface energy imbalance the

2017 here we used the ratio of gpp and et at the monthly scale defined as water use efficiency wue to derive monthly soil evaporation for the us whs site and the details are explained in section 4 1 3 introduction to the canadian land surface scheme class when run in offline mode or in equilibrium climate mode class is used with prescribed vegetation coverage alongside class the canadian terrestrial ecosystem model ctem has been developed to account for dynamic vegetation which simulates vegetation morphological dynamics plant structure and coverage changes ecosystem carbon dynamics

2016 in this study the dynamic vegetation option provided by ctem is turned off when this is done background vegetation parameters such as vegetation height and coverage rooting depth albedo transmissivity mass and maximum and minimum pai must be specified for each study site via an initialization file plant seasonality is regulated by a growth index determined by the air temperature and the top soil layer temperature together this growth index controls woody plants spring budburst from dormant to fully leafed maturity and fall senescence from fully leafed to leafless 3 1 composite method in class each grid cell can contain up to four subareas representing bare soil snow over bare soil vegetation over soil and vegetation over snow for each subarea the parameters representing land surface properties i e albedo transmissivity roughness length etc are computed separately for the two vegetated subareas vegetation over soil and vegetation over snow pai across the five plant functional types broadleaf tree needleleaf tree crop grass and shrub is averaged according to their individual fractional coverages in order to derive the overall pai of one composite vegetation class simulates land radiative and hydrological dynamics separately for these four subareas at the end of each time step the land prognostic variables are averaged across these four subareas in this study we carried out offline class runs with prescribed atmospheric forcing which includes incoming shortwave radiation incoming longwave radiation air temperature specific humidity wind speed precipitation and surface pressure in this way we provided the background meteorological states for land thermal and hydrological dynamics in the following paragraphs we explain both the thermal and hydrological parameterizations in the base class model following verseghy 2012 as well as our newly introduced modifications to accommodate the hydrological processes in water stressed environments 3 2 thermal dynamics incoming shortwave radiation is the primary energy source for thermal dynamics inside the canopy snow pack and soil column the top soil layer absorbs solar energy and emits longwave radiation as well as exchanging energy with the overlying air through sensible and latent heat fluxes all soil layers experience moisture phase change as well as internal energy change caused by soil heat conduction and or soil water mass loss gain the shortwave radiation absorbed by the canopy and snow pack is balanced by vegetation snow longwave radiation sensible and latent heat fluxes water phase change and internal energy storage 3 3 hydrological dynamics precipitation is the driver of land hydrological processes in class when precipitation occurs rain or snow is intercepted by the canopy or falls onto the ground intercepted water on the canopy either falls onto the surface as throughfall or evaporates back to the air as vegetation evaporation water over land can either evaporate directly back to the atmosphere or infiltrate down into the soil column inside the soil column infiltrated water moves in response to gravity suction or infiltration forces in the model after infiltration or direct evaporation back to the air excess water either ponds on the surface or turns into surface runoff if the depth of the ponded water exceeds its maximum value water in the first soil layer is the source of both soil evaporation and plant transpiration vegetation is able to access water in soil layers as long as the roots can reach these layers water draining out of the bottom of the soil column is defined as baseflow the hydraulic conductivity at the bottom is multiplied by a drainage parameter dependent on the site characteristics if the soil column is situated on top of an impermeable layer e g a bog the drainage parameter is set to zero and there will be no baseflow if free drainage can happen the drainage parameter is set to 1 the value of the drainage parameter can vary between these two end states in all our tests the drainage parameters are set to 1 total et is comprised of soil evaporation plant evaporation and plant transpiration in this study soil evaporation and plant transpiration are the two dominant components because of the relatively low leaf areas vegetation evaporation from intercepted water is small compared with transpiration and soil evaporation and so its effect can be neglected 3 3 1 soil evaporation 3 3 1 1 soil evaporation parameterization in the base class model soil evaporation is the sum of evaporation from bare soil and from soil under the canopy evaporation from bare soil is parameterized on the basis of atmospheric demand and an evaporation efficiency parameter β calculated according to lee and pielke 1992 with the available water of the first soil layer as the upper limit the theoretical bare soil surface evaporation rate e 0 m m s 1 is calculated as 1 e 0 ρ a c dh v a q 0 q a in eq 1 ρ a is the density of air k g m 3 q 0 and q a are the specific humidity at the surface and at the reference height k g k g 1 c dh is the surface drag coefficient for evaporation determined by the atmospheric state and v a is the wind speed at a reference height m s 1 surface specific humidity q 0 is parameterized as β q 0 sat 1 β q a with q 0 sat as the saturated specific humidity at the surface k g k g 1 the soil evaporation efficiency β is determined by the saturation state of the top soil layer as 2 β 0 25 1 c o s θ 1 π θ fc 2 in eq 2 θ 1 is the liquid water content of the first soil layer m 3 m 3 and θ fc is its field capacity m 3 m 3 when the water content of the first soil layer is above or at field capacity the soil evaporation efficiency stays at 1 0 when the water content drops below the wilting point the evaporation efficiency is set to zero in the subarea of vegetation over soil evaporation from soil underneath the canopy e 0 c m m s 1 is parameterized as 3 e 0 c ρ a q 0 q a c r a g in eq 3 q a c is the specific humidity of the canopy air k g k g 1 and 1 r a g m s 1 follows the analysis of deardorff 1972 as 4 1 r a g 1 9 10 3 t 0 v t ac v 1 3 in eq 4 t 0 v and t ac v are the virtual potential temperature of the surface and the canopy air with units k for bare soil the maximum surface evaporation rate e 0 max m m s 1 is set to the sum of any surface ponded water present and available liquid water in the top soil layer 5 e 0 max ρ w z p θ 1 θ r δ z 1 δ t in eq 5 ρ w is the density of water k g m 3 z p is the depth of surface ponded water θ 1 and θ r are the first soil layer volumetric water content and minimum residual soil liquid water content m 3 m 3 δ z 1 is the first soil layer depth 10 c m and δ t is the time interval for soil under vegetation the maximum surface evaporation rate e 0 max c m m s 1 is set equal to the extractable moisture of the first soil layer and it is parameterized as 6 e 0 max c ρ w θ 1 θ r δ z δ t in both eqs 5 and 6 the minimum residual soil liquid water content θ r is set to be 0 04 m 3 m 3 in class at each time step the top soil layer evaporation rate as defined in eqs 1 and 3 is constrained to be less than or equal to the soil evaporation limits defined in eqs 5 and 6 3 3 1 2 soil evaporation parameterization for water stressed environments the parameterization of soil evaporation in the base class model is more general than that in lee and pielke 1992 taking into account the available water of the top soil layer however the parameterization of lee and pielke is derived based on pan experiments kondo et al 1990 and the variation of soil structure and hydrological properties in natural conditions might affect the results in the following part we proposed soil evaporation parameterization to take account the hydrological impacts from soil physical sealing and or a biological crust layer the formation of a seal or crust on bare soil is a common phenomenon in arid areas it can act to reduce soil evaporation and preserve more water inside the soil column sela et al 2015 assouline 2004 a biological crust layer is a thin soil layer formed by soil particles and cyanobacteira green algae microfungi bacteria lichens and bryophytes together belnap 2006 observations show that the biological crust layer can increase the upper soil water holding capacity and reduce soil evaporation especially when the surface soil water content is high cantón et al 2004 chamizo et al 2012 2016 xiao et al 2010 in addition observation studies show that rainfall infiltration rates in the vegetation patches are higher than in the intervening bare soil in dryland katra et al 2007 wang et al 2013 due to the higher level of aggregation developed by root growth and polysaccharides production bochet et al 1999 sarah and rodeh 2004 local microtopography can cause surface water to be channeled from crusted bare soil areas toward vegetation patches for infiltration which will further increase the available soil water for plant transpiration chen et al 2013 rodríguez caballero et al 2018 in water stressed sites the surface evaporation is soil moisture limited therefore in this study our modifications to soil evaporation are achieved by limiting the available soil water here for simplicity we used the same limiting factor for bare soil and for soil under vegetation for each individual site for all test runs presented in the following sections we scaled down e 0 max and e 0 max c by a factor r surf adapted from sellers et al 1992 which increases exponentially as the top soil layer dries for the two us sites we used essentially the same formulation as r surf e x p 8 206 4 255 θ 1 θ fc where θ 1 m 3 m 3 is the top soil layer volumetric water content and θ fc m 3 m 3 is its field capacity for the two mediterranean sites we found it necessary to change the second coefficient from 4 255 to 1 0 in order to achieve the best fit with observations r surf e x p 8 206 1 0 θ 1 θ fc the soil compositions at the two sandy us sites are more consistent with the study region in sellers et al 1992 therefore its r surf factor is readily applicable there however the higher clay contents at the es lju and it noe sites required adjustment of the coefficient to account for the higher soil evaporation resistance merlin et al 2016 the shapes of the two curves are illustrated in fig 2 the factor r surf is then used to reduce soil evaporation and conserve more water inside the soil as shown in eqs 7 and 8 7 e 0 max d r y e 0 max r surf 8 e 0 max d r y c e 0 max c r surf here the proposed parameterization efficiently reduces the overestimation of soil evaporation however soil compositions at these two sandy us sites or the two clayey mediterranean sites are not widely different which prevents us from deriving a more general r surf factor for either sandy or clayey regions 3 3 2 vegetation transpiration parameterization in class the vegetation transpiration flux e c m m s is parameterized according to garratt 1992 as 9 e c ρ a q c q a c r b r c in eq 9 q c is the saturated specific humidity at the canopy temperature k g k g 1 q a c is the specific humidity of the canopy air k g k g 1 r b is the boundary layer resistance s m 1 and r c is the stomatal resistance s m 1 in our study evaporation from intercepted water is small compared with transpiration because of the relatively low leaf areas and so its effect can be neglected water for plant transpiration is drawn from soil layers with water contents higher than the minimum residual soil liquid water content θ r 0 04 m 3 m 3 according to the relative mass of roots in each layer 3 3 3 stomatal resistance 3 3 3 1 stomatal resistance parameterization in the base class model in class the stomatal resistance of vegetation is regulated by vapour pressure deficit δ e soil moisture suction ψ s and air temperature t a fig 3 shows graphically these functional relationships i e f δ e f ψ s and f t a the effect of δ e on stomatal resistance is expressed as oren et al 1999 wu et al 2000 10 f δ e δ e 10 0 c v 2 c v 1 as soil layers dry the soil moisture suction increases the effect of soil wetness on stomatal resistance is determined by the soil moisture suction of the wettest layer ψ s choudhury and idso 1985 fischer et al 1981 11 f ψ s 1 ψ s c ψ 1 c ψ 2 in eqs 10 and 11 c v 1 c v 2 and c ψ 1 c ψ 2 are constants dependent on plant functional type pft for all five pfts in class the air temperature only impacts stomatal resistance when it lies outside the 5 c 40 c range the effect of air temperature on stomatal resistance is expressed via piecewise functions as 12 f t a 250 w h e n t a 5 c t a 50 c 13 f t a 1 1 0 1 5 t a w h e n 5 c t a 5 c 14 f t a 1 1 0 1 40 t a w h e n 40 c t a 50 c 15 f t a 1 w h e n 5 c t a 40 c the resulting combined effect on the overall stomatal resistance r c as a result of vapour pressure deficit air temperature and soil aridity is obtained as their product 16 r c f t a f δ e f ψ s r c u in eq 16 r c u is the unstressed stomatal resistance under the ambient incoming visible shortwave radiation 3 3 3 2 stomatal resistance parameterization for water stressed environments in order to increase the responsiveness of shrub species to water stress we use the soil moisture suction of the top soil layer ψ 1 to determine the impact on stomatal resistance that is eq 11 is modified as follows 17 f ψ 1 1 ψ 1 c ψ 1 c ψ 2 the differences between f ψ 1 defined in eq 17 and f ψ s defined in eq 11 are shown in fig 4 it can be seen that f ψ 1 is more responsive in time to soil moisture variations 3 4 root distribution 3 4 1 root distribution parameterization in the base class model in class root density decreases exponentially with depth feddes et al 1974 within a given soil layer the root fraction is calculated as 18 r δ z e x p 3 0 z t e x p 3 0 z b 1 e x p 3 0 z r in eq 18 z t is the depth of the soil layer top z b is the depth of the soil layer bottom and z r is the overall rooting depth the total fraction of roots in each soil layer across the five plant functional types the effective root density is determined as a weighted average over these five vegetation categories at each time step the effective root density in each soil layer is scaled up or down according to the relative aridity of that specific layer that is the root fraction is weighted by the relative soil moisture suction ψ w ψ i ψ w ψ sat where ψ w and ψ sat are the soil moisture suction at the wilting and saturation points and ψ i is the soil moisture suction at the current time step then the root density is re normalized by the sum of the new root density of all layers this enables the vegetation to extract water preferentially from the wettest soil layer regardless of its depth the shrub rooting depth is assigned an assumed default value of 1 0 m in all of the class experiments below except in tests for the it noe site where it is set to the observed soil depth of 0 40 m 3 5 plant seasonality 3 5 1 plant seasonality parameterization in the base class model in the base class model plant seasonality is regulated by a growth index which is determined by the air temperature and the first layer soil temperature the growth index b is 1 for fully leaved mature vegetation and zero for leafless or dormant plants the transitions between these two stages are linear and last for 30 days for woody species at each time step the growth index increases if both the air temperature and the first layer soil temperature are above 2 c when either the air temperature or the first layer soil temperature drops below 2 c at the end of the fully leaved period the growth index of the woody plants is decreased by the increment for each time step until it is reduced to zero this parameterization of woody plant seasonality was primarily derived for representing plant species in high latitudes where temperature is the limiting factor for vegetation growth at each time step the pai varies between pai max and pai min the maximum and minimum values specified in the initialization file as 19 pai pai min pai max pai min b 3 5 2 plant seasonality parameterization for water stressed environments as our study sites are located in dryland areas where water availability is the primary limiting factor for plant growth in the tests presented below we added the relative wetness of the top soil layer w as a second controlling factor for pai variation defined as 20 w ψ w 1 ψ 1 ψ w 1 ψ sat 1 in eq 20 ψ w 1 m is the top layer soil moisture suction at the wilting point 150 m and ψ sat 1 m is the top layer soil moisture suction at saturation ψ sat 1 is calculated from the sand content of the top soil layer x sand as ψ sat 0 01 e x p 0 0302 x sand 4 33 according to cosby et al 1984 ψ 1 is the soil moisture suction of the top soil layer at the current time step parameterized as 21 ψ 1 ψ sat 1 θ 1 θ p 1 b in eq 21 θ 1 is the top soil layer volumetric water content m 3 m 3 and θ p 1 is the pore volume m 3 m 3 determined by the sand content of the soil layer θ p 1 0 126 x sand 48 9 100 b is a constant determined by the clay content of the soil layer b 0 159 x clay 2 91 clapp and hornberger 1978 at each time step pai responds to water stress in addition to temperature stress as 22 pai pai min pai max pai min b w thus pai is equal to pai max when the top soil layer is at saturation and decreases as the top soil layer dries when the top layer soil moisture suction increases to its wilting point ψ w 1 w is equal to zero we set the pai min as 1 0 to avoid numerical instabilities after deriving pai at each time step the active leaf area index ail of the shrubs is parameterized as ail p a i pai min with this approach leaves at the two mediterranean sites remain active whenever the top soil layer is moist and so they respond immediately as soon as rainfall begins again in the autumn however according to observations dryland shrub species become relatively dormant after experiencing active leaf development for about five months kurc and benton 2010 for the us src site morillas et al 2013 for the es lju site reichstein et al 2003 for the it noe site scott and biederman 2017 for the us whs site to incorporate this observed plant phenology we also introduce a minimum 6 month leaf dormancy function following previous studies bonan et al 2003 zeng 2010 that is the pai is arbitrarily reduced to be 20 of the computed pai outside of the active growing season i e from april to september for the us src and us whs sites and from february to july for the es lju and it noe sites the overall differences between the base class parameterization and our modified pai parameterization are shown in fig 5 4 results 4 1 transpiration ratio at study sites fig 6 shows observed monthly precipitation et and gpp for the four study sites averaged across the comparison periods listed in table 1 the seasonality of precipitation and et is in phase at the two us sites and is out of phase at the two mediterranean sites the gpp seasonal variation follows that of et at the us src site gpp peaks in the spring and summer after rainfalls accompanied by a steep plunge in june related to late spring drought at the es lju and it noe sites the gpp peaks in may following the accumulation of spring rainfall and its decrease starts in june in this study water use efficiency wue is defined as the ratio of gpp to et at the monthly time scale following scott and biederman 2017 studies show that wue stays constant at the annual and monthly time scale when transpiration dominates et scott et al 2015 scott and biederman 2017 an implicit assumption of this method is that gpp from transpiring leaf and stem components dominates overall gpp therefore this method might not be applicable at the two mediterranean sites where root development constitutes a significant portion of gpp during the summer droughts lloret et al 1999 padilla et al 2009 we applied this relationship to derive the bare ground evaporation for the us whs site from july to october across the comparison period fig 7 shows monthly et versus gpp with different colors representing different months for each individual month the y axis intercept represents the average soil evaporation scott and biederman 2017 the slopes of the et gpp lines are mostly consistent from july to october with decreasing y axis intercepts indicating that wue remains constant while bare soil evaporation decreases from july to october scott and biederman 2017 the transpiration ratio for us whs summers during the comparison period is derived as 49 this method is not applicable at the us src site because of its low transpiration in its rainy season with only 24 vegetation coverage observations show that annual transpiration is only 42 of et in 2008 with precipitation as high as 461 mm year cavanaugh et al 2011 this site is much drier from 2009 to 2012 with annual precipitation varying from 194 mm to 333 mm with less intense rainfall events happening in the rainy season rain water is less likely to infiltrate into deeper soil layers water in the shallower soil layers favors soil evaporation instead of plant transpiration cavanaugh et al 2011 thus the transpiration is likely less than 42 of et for the 2009 2012 comparison period previous studies indicate that underground root growth contributes a significant portion of gpp in the mediterranean there precipitation varies greatly from year to year fluctuating from 182 mm to 1143 mm at the es lju site and from 433 mm to 844 mm at the it noe site accordingly the available soil water for et at any given soil depth also varies greatly during summers plants cope with water shortage by reducing their active leaf area and increasing stomatal resistance to restrain et and or by extending roots to access more water adiku et al 2000 poole et al 1981 quevedo and francés 2008 rambal 1993 reichstein et al 2003 sala and tenhunen 1996 thus wue can increase in drier years as less gpp is allocated to leaves and stems and more is allocated to the rooting system reduced leaf and stem gpp are likely to cause transpiration reduction and therefore et reduction meanwhile enhanced gpp of the rooting system enables plants to access water to sustain their survival by lateral root spreading and taproot lengthening for example during the 2003 drought in europe shrubs in pianosa italy were able to achieve the same gpp level as that in 2002 with reduced et fig 8 reichstein et al 2007 indicating a higher wue at the two mediterranean sites rainfall occurs mainly in the spring fall and winter when the evaporation demand is lower than that in summer therefore precipitation is able to penetrate deeper to provide soil moisture recharge for the rainless summers as noted in section 2 the es lju site overlies karst limestone bedrock and shrub species are able to extract soil water stored inside cracks fissures and pipes of bedrock to maintain relatively high et rates when the top soil layer dries up in the summer cantón et al 2010 domingo et al 1999 thus plant transpiration contributes a large portion of et from may to august also as noted above the it noe site is underlain by relatively shallow limestone bedrock fig 6 shows that there et again exceeds precipitation from april till august indicating that et is supplied from deep layer soil water stored during the rainy seasons in short transpiration ratios in these two mediterranean sites are likely to be high during summer drought when more than 50 of annual et takes place at that time soil evaporation is likely to constitute a relatively small portion of et note that even though shrub species manage to survive on water from deeper soil layers in dry months we still parameterize stomatal resistance according to the wetness of the top soil layer to efficiently pass on the water stress to plant transpiration during summer months observations show that in the mediterranean region even at shrub sites with higher precipitation root water uptake still responds to drought pressure in relatively dry summers rambal 1984 in addition growth maintenance and nutrient intake by the deeper roots require more energy compared with these by the shallow roots schenk and jackson 2002 2005 which could work as another constraint in terms of efficient deep root development and functioning compared with the shallow rooting system 4 2 overview of base runs and test runs we used a multi year set of atmospheric forcings to run class for 8 cycles and then compared the simulation from the last cycle with observations for example in the case of the us src site where data are available from 2008 to 2012 we repeated this 5 year period of meteorological forcing to run class 7 times assuming that we had then achieved an equilibrium state over land we used the same period of atmospheric forcing to run class an 8th time from the 8th cycle we only used the simulation results from years 2009 to 2012 in order to avoid any spurious effects caused by the discontinuity between the end of 2012 and the beginning of 2008 table 3 summarizes the base runs and the test runs the base runs were carried out using the standard class formulations and the test runs successively incorporated the modifications described in the above sections to accommodate water stressed shrub environments in test 1 we introduced the adjustment to e 0 max and e 0 max c described in section 3 3 1 2 aimed at reducing soil evaporation to take into account the combined effect of a thin impermeable surface layer and the preferential rainwater infiltration in vegetation patches as well as the favorable runoff reallocation toward the vegetation patches because of the empirical nature of our proposed parameterization its physical implications need further support from observation studies this test led to exacerbation of the transpiration overestimation in the mediterranean sites due to the increased soil water content whereupon we separately added the water limitation factor on pai presented in section 3 5 2 to produce test 2 and the modifications to f ψ s described in section 3 3 3 2 to produce test 3 in order to demonstrate their impacts on plant transpiration individually the combined influence of all these modifications on the hydrological processes is shown in test 4 4 3 comparison between base runs and observations fig 8 shows the comparison between observed and simulated et and its components in the base class run at the monthly time scale evaporation from intercepted water on vegetation is small and is not included here the black solid lines represent the observed monthly et and the gray shaded region represents one standard deviation of et across comparison years for the us src and us whs sites class is able to capture the et seasonality however et is underestimated in the late spring before the soil is replenished by summer rainfalls during the rainy seasons plant transpiration only contributes 18 of et at us src which is much lower than the observed value of 42 cavanaugh et al 2011 at the us whs site the modelled transpiration is 25 of et for the period of july through october and is likewise lower than both the observed value of 58 scott et al 2006 and our derived value of 49 in fig 7 in these simulations with the base class model soil evaporation is the largest component of et constituting 80 at us src and 72 at us whs in the summer rainy season table 4 compared with the two us southwest sites the discrepancies between simulated and observed et at the two mediterranean sites are caused by both soil evaporation overestimation in the rainy season and plant transpiration overestimation underestimation during the summer drought at the es lju site the simulated et peaks in april which is one month earlier than the observation this early peak is attributable to the overestimation of soil evaporation soil evaporation also contributes to an overestimation of et from october to december the higher than observed soil evaporation in the rainy season is partly caused by the lack of representation of local characteristics including developed karst and denuded surface soil which all facilitate the rapid infiltration of water cantón et al 2010 li et al 2011 at the it noe site the simulated et peaks in march while the observed et peaks in may the most severe et underestimation ranges from july to august soil evaporation dominates et for most of the year 4 4 comparison between test runs and observations the comparison between et and its components from test 1 to test 4 and the observations at the monthly time scale is shown in fig 9 at the two us southwest sites the increased plant responsiveness to water stress in test 2 test 3 and test 4 does not improve et significantly after soil evaporation is reduced in test 1 the only exception is in the late spring at us src when the enhanced sensitivity of f ψ s to water stress helps reduce plant transpiration caused by the higher soil water content compared with the slight et underestimation during the us whs rainy summers summer et underestimation at the us src site is more severe the underestimation of et during the us src summer might be caused by the fact that vegetation coverage at this site is not high enough to channel water into the soil column as efficiently as in the more densely vegetated us whs site therefore the sparsely vegetated us src site tends to generate higher soil evaporation during the rainy season at the two mediterranean sites the overestimation of summer plant transpiration is more efficiently addressed by the modification of the f ψ s factor in test 3 than by the modification of the pai factor in test 2 the improved et seasonality at the es lju site in test 4 is due to the reduced soil evaporation in the rainy season and enhanced responsiveness of plant transpiration to water stress in dry spells the es lju site is characterized by dolines fissured and fractured outcrops as well as denuded soil which all facilitate rapid infiltration cantón et al 2010 li et al 2011 therefore observed et in the autumn rainy season is still lower than in the class simulation during summer droughts class underestimates et slightly as the summer water stress can be alleviated to some degree by the plants extraction of soil water stored inside the karst limestone bedrock cantón et al 2010 at the it noe site the overestimation of et during the rainy season is reduced in the test runs however et is still underestimated during the summer droughts the higher observed et might be attributable to lateral root expansion and or the sporadic deep soil patches deeper than 0 4 m which are not represented in the class physics 5 conclusion and discussion in this study we have implemented shrubs as the new fifth plant functional type in class and have simulated the hydrological processes in four shrub covered areas under water stress with two in the us southwest and two in the mediterranean we modified class to accommodate water limited shrublands and capture their seasonal et variation for this purpose we scaled down the maximum soil evaporation and prioritized the first soil layer water content as the primary controlling factor for variation of shrub stomatal resistance and pai in this way we reduced soil evaporation and increased the sensitivity of plant transpiration to water shortage especially in the mediterranean regions where shrubs have to endure long summer droughts this work represents the first in depth assessment of the ability of class to simulate hydrological processes in water stressed environments where et is restricted by available soil water instead of primarily by available energy as in mid and high latitudes the modifications that we have made to the class code will be easy to implement operationally through changes to the initialization files and the introduction of switches based on the presence or absence of shrubs further refinement of our work would require more comprehensive long term measurements of soil moisture at various soil depths compared with variations in pai and et which are not routinely made in addition the applicability of our proposed two sets of soil evaporation reduction factors r surf is constrained by the similarity of the soil composition at the two sandy us sites and the two clayey mediterranean sites in our study we would need data from regions with substantially different soil compositions to derive a more general parameterization of the soil evaporation reduction factor merlin et al 2016 2018 given the limitations of the currently available data we consider that this work represents a significant enhancement to class in our study all sites are situated on flat terrain and each fluxnet site only represents about 1 3 km2 spatially running et al 1999 in dryland with relatively sparse vegetation coverage both soil evaporation and plant transpiration are mostly determined by soil moisture availability which is highly heterogeneous at the spatial scale the hydrological impacts of shrub species on the local water budget can be quite different even within short distances e g poole et al 1981 the applicability of our current parameterizations over larger scales will depend on how well class is able to represent different soil layers contribution to et in areas where soil moisture is the limiting factor in addition geomorphological factors like the slope and the orientation of topography also play important roles in et variation and their impacts should be evaluated the spatial applicability of our work will be explored in the future our study focuses on the shrubland hydrology where water is the limiting factor for the hydrological processes when comes to simulating shrubland s hydrology where radiation is the limiting factor for et for example in the high latitude regions special attention would shift to shrub species impacts on the radiative processes over land dornes et al 2008 marsh et al 2010 declaration of competing

6062,detection and attribution of streamflow changes would be a standing point towards optimizing the management of basin scale water resources the three gorges reservoir tgr the largest hydropower project worldwide has recently experienced obvious inflow reduction which has restricted its capability to achieve the designed electricity generation this study considered the design period of tgr 1961 1990 as the baseline period for evaluating inflow variations during the subsequent impact period 1991 2015 annual inflow reduced by 6 and seasonal inflow significantly decreased by 16 in autumn which is the main season for filling reservoir a new stepwise procedure with the help of a water use model a lumped hydrological model and a generic reservoir operation model is presented to unravel the causes of inflow reduction results revealed that the drier climate predominantly caused inflow decreases human activities have notably enhanced in recent decades however they have not posed significant threats to inflow deficiency climate variability water consumption and upstream reservoir operation contributed by 78 15 and 7 to decrease annual inflow while they contributed by 63 4 and 33 to reduce autumn inflow respectively the proposed procedure can quantitatively disentangle major human impacts including water consumption and reservoir regulation such information enriches policy makers knowledge for framing delicacy management of regional human activities in response to changing streamflow pattern keywords three gorges reservoir inflow variation climate variability water consumption reservoir operation 1 introduction attribution of past changes in river streamflow associated with alteration in climate condition and human activities has recently attracted several scholars attention dey and mishra 2017 roderick and farquhar 2011 wang 2014 wu et al 2017 these researches are mainly motivated by the consensus that decomposition of streamflow changes shed light on the hydrological response to climatic or human s changes in the catchment however whether the magnitude and timing of streamflow fluctuate beyond the envelope of historical variability has still remained unclear and if so why is very relevant for framing adaptation strategies in terms of regional water resources planning and management it was reported that several major rivers in china have experienced downward trends of streamflow li et al 2017 wang et al 2015a xu et al 2014 zhai and tao 2017 and the yangtze river that is the largest river in china was even no exception its annual discharge has monotonically decreased by 11 over the industrial period 1865 2008 at the most seaward gauging station yang et al 2010 this negative change has been a serious challenge accompanying with provision of sustainable water resources for human consumption food production electricity generation etc the three gorges reservoir tgr which is fed by the runoff from almost the entire upper catchment of the yangtze river indeed suffers from reduction of inflow at present the tgr is the largest hydropower project worldwide and it is also a strategic and ambitious contribution to meet the growing electricity demands of china territory accounting for 14 of china s total hydropower generation iha 2013 however the tgr has failed to accomplish its designed electricity generation twice in four years due to lower inflow than that in a normal year since it was entered into full operation during 2012 2015 ctg 2013 2016 while the side effects of its operation on altering the downstream flow regime has greatly attracted public attention e g aggravating downstream hydrological droughts li et al 2013 extremely low water levels lai et al 2014 and environmental flow deficit wang et al 2018 during the period of water impoundment little attention has been paid to inflow variations and their causes from the upstream area hence such information may realize the development of adaptive measures to mitigate a possible decline in hydropower generation caused by inflow variations both climate variability and human activities play crucial role in the change of hydrological regime in recent decades human activities have become increasingly extensive in the upper yangtze river especially after chinese economic reform in 1978 the booming economy inevitably increased water demands to meet the needs of households manufacturing electricity and food production etc which directly altered temporal distribution of streamflow via water withdrawal and reservoirs regulation nilsson et al 2005 categorized the yangtze as one of the 104 world s large river systems that have been strongly affected by constructed dams according to the extent of channel fragmentation and flow regulation in particular in the upper yangtze river total storage capacity of large reservoirs may rise up to 61 of annual runoff in case of on time completion of all dams whose are under planning and construction zhang et al 2012 alcamo et al 2003b presented a business as usual scenario of continuing demographic economic and technological trends up to 2025 including the yangtze river they estimated that the growth of water demand would outweigh the assumed improvement in water use efficiency indicating higher pressure on available water along with intensified human activities changes in climatic variables have also been detected in the upper yangtze river the basin was found to be dominated by an upward temperature trend as well as a downward precipitation trend chen et al 2014 zhang et al 2005 against the backdrop of global warming the mean annual temperature has increased by 0 8 c while precipitation has decreased by 3 over the period of 1955 2014 chen et al 2016 this warming and drier climate may similarly continue for another decade until 2030 based on processed global climate model outputs in the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 sun et al 2015 some efforts have been made to identify major causes for streamflow decreases however the conclusions were spatially inconsistent in different sub catchments within the yangtze river basin for example in one hand yang et al 2015 attributed 61 of runoff decline for the entire river basin during post tgr decade 2003 2012 to a reduction in precipitation when that is relative to the pre tgr decade 1993 2002 this is also the case in hanjiang a tributary of the yangtze where climate variation accounted for 84 90 of the runoff reduction in 1991 2006 compared with the period of 1951 1989 liu et al 2012 on the other hand zhang et al 2015 reported that human activities have become dominant driving forces in the upper and middle yangtze river since 1961 hence specific investigations on the inflow variations regarding the tgr and their causes are still indispensable in an attempt made to differentiate the influence of climate variability and human activities on streamflow variations hydrological modelling mass balance and regression approach have been already utilized ahn and merwade 2014 wu et al 2017 these approaches normally share a common rationale that a baseline or a near pristine period can be determined with negligible human activities so that an empirical or a physically based hydrological model could be set up on the basis of runoff observations to estimate climate induced variations of streamflow the discrepancy between the observed variation of streamflow and the climate induced variation is attributed to human activities however the majority of rivers have a long history of human activities that affect their streamflow patterns in particular water abstraction the absolute ignorance of human activities during the baseline period will over or under estimate human influences depending on how pre inflection human activities affect streamflow dey and mishra 2017 wang 2014 zhang et al 2016 moreover disentangling of two major impacts of direct human activities i e water consumption and reservoir regulation is of great significance for policy makers wada et al 2016 therefore this study recommended a stepwise procedure to estimate absolute streamflow variation caused by climate variability water consumption and reservoir regulation it was also attempted to back calculate regional water uses over the entire study period by the use of a global water assessment model called watergap 2 doll et al 2003 by excluding human influences during the baseline period natural runoff process was reconstructed based on a lumped hydrological model in addition a generic reservoir operation model was applied to simulate water storage increments of upstream reservoirs for an impact period with dramatic dam construction consequently the annual and seasonal inflow variations induced by climate variability could be quantified involving water consumption and upstream reservoir operation between the baseline and the impact period the practical purpose of the present study was to identify dominant factors causing decline in annual and autumn inflow to the tgr the procedure proposed for quantifying the role of climate and direct human impacts on streamflow can potentially be applied in catchments along with multi reservoirs and non negligible water abstraction 2 regional setting and datasets 2 1 the upper yangtze river basin the main course of yangtze river originates from the qinghai tibet plateau and flows 6300 km eastward to the east china sea its upper basin lies in the transition zone from the west high alpine terrain to the east low plain in which the corresponding elevation ranges from 5000 m above sea level at headwater section to below 500 m near yichang a hydrological gauging station dividing yangtze river into the upper and lower sections the tgr 111 0 e 30 82 n has been located at the downstream end of the upper yangtze river basin see fig 1 and it receives discharge from a drainage area of 1 006 mkm2 with mean annual total streamflow of about 427 gm3 1961 2015 which accounted for approximately 50 of the yangtze river s total streamflow as a result of the abundant water resources and steep river slopes the upper yangtze river has a tremendous potential for hydropower generation six tributaries jinshajiang river yalongjiang river daduhe river minjiang river jialingjiang river and wujiang river in addition to the up reaches of yangtze river are extensively used for hydropower exploitation huang and yan 2009 the tgr is the first reservoir providing carryover storage over multiple seasons in the main reaches of yangtze accompanying with impressively large storage capacity 39 3 gm3 by global standards however in terms of hydrology the tgr can only store 9 and also regulate 4 of the mean annual total inflow thus its hydropower potential is firmly dependent on the allocation of seasonal inflows which is highly uneven as a consequence of the monsoon climate dominating the majority of the basin annual and monthly mean of precipitation potential evapotranspiration pet for the upper yangtze river and the observed inflow to the tgr are listed in table 1 in a normal year the subtropical monsoon transports a huge amount of atmospheric moisture from the east and south china sea to the basin during april to october thus the inflow is mainly concentrated on mid summer and early autumn from july to september accounting for nearly one half of the total rate per year however the tgr does not store water until the period of mid autumn october to reserve capacity for attenuating summer floods thus the hydropower potential of tgr is particularly sensitive to the inflow variations in autumn 2 2 major human activities in the basin socioeconomic development after china stabilized around 1960s major socioeconomic indicators of the basin such as gross domestic product gdp population electricity production as well as effective irrigation area eia have continuously increased for over more than half a century according to the census as shown in fig 2 a regional population has been doubled to 173 million within 55 years even though the rate of population growth remarkably slowed down after the 1980s when one child policy was implemented to sustain this population growth the eia for food supply has increased by 2 4 times from 21 103 km2 in 1961 to 51 103 km2 in 2015 see fig 2b as a measure of people s productive activity the rate of gdp growth is impressive as well it is noteworthy that the annual growth rate of gdp in china was continually higher than 6 5 from the 1990s onward in addition the growth of electricity production was in consistent with the gdp rate the rapid increase in the above mentioned factors implies more extensive water use activities and non negligible growth of freshwater consumption abstracted from river network reservoir construction the storage delays in reservoirs not only redistribute seasonal streamflow but also result in water loss through increasing water surface evaporation as well as initial filling of reservoirs over the period of 1990 2015 several construction projects related to large dams were completed or being constructed in the basin their main utilizations were hydropower generation flood control and irrigation up to 2015 the basin upstream of the tgr involved 35 large reservoirs with an installed power generation capacity in excess of 300 mw in operation the cumulative total and regulated storage capacity had reached 68 and 35 gm3 respectively which are about twice the ones of the tgr as illustrated in fig 2c 2 3 datasets data applied in the analyses consist of three categories reservoir information hydrometeorological observations and water use and socio economic data general information belonged to 36 large reservoirs including the tgr was extracted from the 4th national survey on hydroelectric resources published in 2005 and almanac of china s water power 1961 2015 data belonged to each reservoir described geographical location year of initial operation catchment area riverbed slope and total storage capacity see table s1 according to the location of 36 large reservoirs and 5 hydrological stations yichang is not included the upper yangtze river was divided into 41 sub basins as shown in fig 3 monthly discharge data at five gauging stations including pingshan gaochang fushun beibei and wulong in the upper yangtze river basin were collected to calibrate the water balance model for major tributaries of the basin see fig 1 on the main reaches between the tgr and yichang station there was indeed a reservoir being operated named gezhouba however it was a run of river hydroelectric project without a notable impact on seasonal streamflow consequently historical records at yichang station were served as a practical estimate of virtual inflow to the tgr before the dam being constructed in june 2003 afterwards observed inflow to the tgr was compiled from china three gorges corporation as a chinese state owned power company monthly observations of meteorological data belonging to 75 stations are plotted in fig 3 which acquired from the national climate center of china meteorological administration daily pet was determined for each station using the penman monteith method monthly pet was computed by accumulating the daily values general description of the penman monteith method was given in supplementary evidences the thiessen polygon method was used to calculate basin wide precipitation and pet data over the time as well the values of population eia and electricity production were gathered from the provincial statistical yearbooks of 9 provinces in mainland china qinghai tibet sichuan yunnan chongqing gansu shaanxi guizhou and hubei describing upstream tributaries of the tgr assume that population eia and electricity production are evenly distributed within each province then their basin wide value can be derived from multiplying the density by the area of each province located in the basin it was herein attempted to apply china s gdp per capita constant 2005 us derived from world bank national accounts data http geodata grid unep ch as a surrogate for basin wide value annual national water withdrawal data were collected on the basis of china statistical yearbooks published since 2000 for calibrating industrial and domestic use models data on regional total water withdrawal and consumption in the upper yangtze river were collected from changjiang and southwest river water resources bulletin 1998 2015 which serve to cross check on the total water withdrawal simulation the period of study and analysis includes the baseline period 1961 1990 and the impact period 1991 2015 the year of 1990 is a milestone with regard to human activities in the region as it is the year from which on economic growth and dam construction began to accelerate in addition the tgr was designed before 1990 thus understanding of main causes of inflow variations after the design period is crucial to design an optimal reservoir operation strategy 3 methods 3 1 statistical analysis for detecting abrupt changes the pettitt test was used to identify abrupt changes in hydrometeorological variables the test is widely used in the stochastic analysis to detect abrupt changes in the mean distribution of the variable of interest due to its robustness for data distribution skewness under the null hypothesis of no change rougé et al 2013 xie et al 2014 the mann whitney u test was utilized for testing two samples before and after the change point obtained from the same distribution in which a change point was selected maximizing the statistic the pettitt s statistics u τ n were derived from the rank based comparison between observations with length of n before and after a specific time τ which could be defined as follows 1 u τ n i 1 τ j τ 1 n sgn x j x i where sgn θ 1 if θ 0 0 if θ 0 and 1 if θ 0 once a potential change point is specified e g the year of 1990 the confidence probability of change can be quantified as 2 p 1 2 exp 6 u τ n 2 n 2 n 3 given a critical level of confidence 1 α that usually equals 95 if p 1 α the null hypothesis is rejected and it can be inferred that a significant change has occurred at the point τ the pettitt test may lead to misleading results when hydrometeorological data are auto correlated to overcome this weakness we followed the tfpwcu procedure i e trend free prewhitening along with residuals correction and unbiased estimation of autocorrelation coefficient to mitigate the adverse effect of autocorrelation on assessing the confidence probability of change serinaldi and kilsby 2016 the original data was whitened via a short term persistence process lag one autoregressive ar1 and a long term persistence process fractional gaussian noise fgn respectively before implementing the pettitt test significant changes were reported only if the ar 1 based and fgn based prewhitening approaches reached an agreement see table s2 3 2 quantitative assessment of inflow variations 3 2 1 general framework for quantifying the attribution to inflow changes to differentiate and quantify the relative importance of major factors influencing inflow the water balance equation needs to be developed that is described as 3 i tgr q nat q use δ s res where i tgr is the monthly total inflow to the tgr q nat and q use denote the natural runoff and the water consumption in the basin respectively and δ s res represents the monthly increments in water storage of upstream reservoirs and it is positive while more water is stored in the reservoirs at the end of the month than at the beginning the equation was established regarding the basic assumption that climate variability water consumption and upstream reservoir operation were only drivers for monthly inflow to the tgr thus the variations in natural runoff water consumption and water storage increments of upstream reservoirs were accurately simulated and compared so as to assess their relative contributions to total inflow changes the procedure for calibrating and validating models to reproduce historical variations of the three mentioned impact factors are outlined as follows step 1 water use reconstruction the water use model was calibrated based on water use records 2000 2015 and then was applied to reconstruct water uses over the whole study period 1961 2015 step 2 natural runoff simulation the baseline period 1961 1990 was divided into calibration 1961 1980 and validation 1981 1990 phases to calibrate and validate the hydrological model parameters during the baseline period only 3 out of 35 reservoirs were in operation their cumulative total storage capacities take less than one percent of the annual inflow to the tgr see fig 2c consequently the differences between the observed inflow and the simulated water consumption were calculated to present reliable references for calibrating hydrological model so as to create natural runoff for the entire study period step 3 reservoir regulation estimation the reservoir operation model was calibrated against the estimated monthly water storage increments of upstream reservoirs δ s res in the impact period the estimated δ s res were calculated by subtracting the simulated water consumption and natural runoff obtained from the observed inflow if the model was capable of reproducing these estimation values climate variability water consumption and upstream reservoir operation would be taken as the major factors into account influencing monthly inflow variations otherwise we might suspect that there were other effective factors which were not considered by the aforementioned water balance equation eq 3 we should not overlook that model validation is also an essential procedure for water use model and reservoir operation model with regard to water use model water withdrawal in each sector was calibrated according to national statistics while their totality was verified in reference to total water withdrawal documented in regional statistics as actual reservoir operation data are scattered over independent companies which can hardly be gathered we resorted to the cumulative storage capacity of these reservoirs as a surrogate for reflecting the general impact of reservoir operation the growth of cumulative storage capacity over time was applied to verify the output of reservoir operation model i e cumulative water storage increments of upstream reservoirs 3 2 2 water use model the water use model of watergap2 was used to simulate water withdrawal in major water use sectors e g domestic industry and irrigation water consumption was considered as the part of the withdrawn water that was consumed through evapotranspiration incorporating into manufacture crops and humans the water consumption was estimated q use eq 3 by applying the multi year average value of consumptive uses ratio i e 45 which was collected from the changjiang and southwest river water resources bulletin 1998 2015 the mentioned model could estimate withdrawn water based on the water use intensity in each sector and corresponding driving force the driving forces of water use refer to population in the domestic sector electricity generation in the industrial sector and eia in the irrigation sector the domestic and industrial water intensities were modeled by considering variations in structure and technology of water use according to the data describing global water use trends alcamo et al 2003a suggested a sigmoid curve to describe the structural water use intensity in the domestic sector m3 person and a hyperbolic curve to describe the structural water use intensity in the industrial sector m3 mwh denoted by dswi and iswi respectively 4 dswi d s w i min d s w i max 1 exp r dom g d p 2 5 iswi 1 r ind gdp g d p min i s w i min where gdp is the per capita annual gdp us year r dom and r ind are dimensionless curve parameters that require calibration further accounting for technological change improving water use efficiency and dswi and iswi can be computed by 6 dwi d s w i 1 η dom t t 0 7 iwi i s w i 1 η ind t t 0 where η dom and η ind are the annual rates of decrease in structural water use intensity year t 0 is the time when technological change is taken into account here it was attempted to assume t 0 1980 η dom and η ind equal 0 6 that is consistent with the reports for hindcasting and projecting of global water uses published by florke et al 2013 and wada et al 2016 the irrigation water intensity is the irrigation of water requirement per unit of crop land mm km2 it is computed for each month of the growing season as the difference between the crop water requirement and the available soil moisture supplied by precipitation 8 irwi k c e pet p avail η irri where η irri is the ratio of irrigation water consumption over withdrawal in absence of detail data on measuring improvement in irrigation water use efficiency it could be assumed that η irri would be the same as the basin wide consumptive uses ratio i e 45 p avail is the effective precipitation available to the crop that was estimated on the basis of the united states department of agriculture usda soil conservation service method scs e pet denotes the pet the non dimensional crop coefficient k c was set for the five growing months as 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 0 8 for paddy situations doll and siebert 2002 we assumed the cropping pattern to be paddy rice over the effective irrigation area because the basin is among the major paddy rice cropping areas of the country the growing season was determined using a rule based algorithm incorporating the site specific meteorological conditions doll and siebert 2002 sectoral water intensities multiplied by driving forces yielded the withdrawn water both of the domestic industrial and irrigation water withdrawals were calculated in each sub basin and then aggregated to the whole basin scale 3 2 3 monthly hydrological model for assessing hydrological consequences of climate variability a lumped monthly rainfall runoff model was employed which initially proposed by xiong and guo 1999 and guo 2002 and that is appropriate for using in the humid and semi humid region of china this two parameter model namely xiong model considers runoff as a single component it offers parsimonious yet refined structure to describe monthly runoff generation process and simplifies model s calibration its high efficiency in reproducing historical monthly runoff has been proved in more than 100 basins in china multi model comparison results revealed that two parameter models e g xiong model are perfect to achieve a comparable or even better performance than complex models reflecting that the objective is proper e g construction of monthly natural runoff that is driven by historical or projected variations of climatic variables bai et al 2015 the structure of model consists of two fundamental functions for simulating actual evapotranspiration e act and natural runoff q nat eq 3 at the t th month which are given as 9 e act t c e pan t tanh p t e pan t 10 q nat t s soil t 1 p t e act t tanh s soil t 1 p t e act t sc 11 s soil t s soil t 1 p t e act t q nat t where climatic inputs precipitation p and pan evaporation e pan determine water limited and energy limited conditions for the model respectively without changing physical meaning pet was adopted instead of pan evaporation as the energy boundary to restrict the actual evapotranspiration the quantity of the remaining water in the soil after the evaporation losses is determined by the term s soil t 1 p t e act t with s soil t 1 being soil water content at the end of the t 1 th month soil water content at the end of the next month s soil t is calculated according to the water conservation law eq 11 the evaporation coefficient c and the field capacity sc are model parameters which were calibrated based on two assessment criterion including nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and water balance error wbe the ranges and optimized values of the model parameters are given in table 2 3 2 4 reservoir operation model generic reservoir operation models are often adopted solutions to comprehensively assess the large scale hydrologic alterations caused by multi reservoirs using limited information including reservoir specifications inflow generation and water demand doll et al 2009 ehsani et al 2016 in this study the algorithm developed by hanasaki et al 2006 was used to simulate the process of reservoir outflows the algorithm presents a representative operation scheme diverting excess water from the wet season to the dry season in addition to fulfilling downstream water requirements this scheme does not necessary be the same as the actual operation rules at each reservoir however it reflects the general principle of reservoir regulation as such the monthly release r is parameterized as 12 r α 0 5 2 k y r p 1 α 0 5 2 i res 0 α 0 5 k y r p α 0 5 where α denotes the total storage capacity to mean total annual inflow ratio k y is the release coefficient reflecting initial storage in the y th operational year i res is the monthly inflow and r p is the provisional monthly release accounting for mean annual inflow and fluctuations in downstream water requirements herein downstream refers to the downward area to the next reservoir or if there was no further reservoir to the outlet of the basin apart from hanasaki et al s scheme 2006 evaporation losses were regarded from water surface of large reservoirs the difference between the potential and actual evapotranspiration was added to the water balance of reservoirs thus taking into account the landscape change from land to open water body reservoir evaporation is directly proportional to reservoir surface area however this requires establishing a geometrical relationship to translate reservoir storage volume to surface area for that purpose it was attempted to select a tetrahedron shape with isosceles triangles proposed by fekete et al 2010 to compute the reservoir surface area as a function of the storage the monthly increments in water storage of upstream reservoirs δ s res as previously defined in eq 3 was then calculated according to the water balance of reservoirs which is expressed as 13 δ s res upstream i res e res β r s dead s res δ s res s total where the term upstream indicates integration over the basin upstream of the tgr e res denotes the increased evaporation losses s res is water content in reservoirs at the beginning of the month the reservoir storage may vary from dead storage s dead to total storage s total herein β is a dimensionless coefficient for correcting monthly releases and it is used to account for the impact of human s decisions on monthly releases after calibration it was revealed that β was in the range between 0 5 and 2 5 among different months with a β below 0 5 no more inflow can be stored as the reservoir has been filled while with a β above 2 5 no more release is produced as the reservoir is nearly empty therefore if β is inside the range of 0 5 2 5 that may prevent the reservoir operation model from reproducing monthly releases in an unrealistic manner 4 results and discussion 4 1 the observed inflow variations precipitation and pet the pettitt test was utilized to evaluate the confidence probability of abrupt changes in the mean value of annual and seasonal inflows precipitation and pet from the baseline period to the impact period fig 4 depicts the computed magnitude percentage and probability of the variations in comparison with the baseline period annual inflow was 27 gm3 6 lower during the impact period this magnitude of reduction accounts for nearly 70 of total storage capacity of the tgr that has practical significance for hydropower generation considering the intra annual variability seasonal inflows were stable in spring march may and became slightly lower in summer june august and higher in winter december february significant inflow variations occurred in autumn september november with a decrease of 24 gm3 16 according to the variations were shown in climatic variables seasonal precipitation did not remarkably change during spring and summer however it became slightly larger in winter and significantly smaller in autumn autumn precipitation decreased by 19 mm 9 annual precipitation declined insignificantly by 18 mm 2 changes in pet were positive in all seasons rising pet neutralized increase of precipitation in winter and emphasized the aggravation of water loss in autumn autumn pet rose insignificantly by 4 mm 2 qualitatively the increased pet and decreased precipitation were consistent with annual and autumn inflow reductions however to find out whether climatic impact has dominated inflow changes it was attempted to resort to the numerical simulation results fig 5 presents the simulated total inflow as the summation of natural runoff and water consumption for the baseline period and by integrating monthly increments in upstream reservoir storage for the impact period calibration of the hydrological model was carried out from 1961 to 1980 and validation was from 1981 to 1990 it can be clearly seen that the simulated total inflow was well aligned with the observations in the baseline period the nse coefficient in the calibration and validation phases is 93 7 and 95 7 on the monthly time scale respectively the wbe coefficient for these two phases is 2 0 and 1 0 respectively by further involving the effects of reservoir operation the simulated total inflow excellently reproduces historical variations for the later impact period with nearly the same nse 93 1 and a better wbe 0 9 accordingly it is feasible to reliably investigate variations in each factor in order to assess their impacts on total inflow variations 4 2 variations in water use water use hindcasting presents widespread increases in domestic industrial and irrigation water withdrawals driven by growing population and rising prosperity the modeled temporal variations of sectoral water uses over the basin during the past 55 years are shown in fig 6 the overall regional water uses increased by 9 3 gm3 between the baseline and the impact period specifically regional domestic industrial and irrigation water uses increased by 2 7 gm3 0 4 gm3 and 6 2 gm3 respectively since there was no regional dataset reporting sectoral water uses the domestic and industrial water use models were calibrated based on input data derived from national statistical values that were rescaled to the upper yangtze river according to the density of population and electricity production the simulated domestic and industrial water withdrawal achieved a satisfactory agreement with the national statistics regional total water withdrawal published by changjiang and southwest river water resources bulletin was not incorporated into water use modelling thus it provided a reference to validate the performance of water use model fig 6 shows that the model outcomes reproduced the increasing water use trend that has been recorded between 1998 and 2015 during 1998 2015 the multiyear average value of simulated total water withdrawal was estimated to be 6 lower than the recorded data this underestimation can be ascribed to some minor water use sectors which were not explicitly considered in this study despite that the current simulation results well reflected the development of major sectoral water uses to be specific there was a flat increase of domestic water withdrawal between 1975 and 1990 owing to introduction of efficiency improvement see green line in fig 6 an increase was apparent again since 1990 mainly related to rising population and growing domestic structural water use intensity which may attribute to increasing demands for household water use appliances the household water use demands would eventually saturate with the growth in income as domestic water uses were stabilized around 2010 water withdrawn for industrial purposes peaked in 1980 reaching 13 gm3 per year followed by a decline until 2000 although the electricity production steadily rose during this time period see purple line in fig 6 after that industrial water withdrawal gradually recovered to 11 gm3 in 2015 both decreasing the structural water use intensity as well as improving water saving technologies slowed down the corresponding trend and even decreased industrial water withdrawal along with economic booming which began since 1980s china encountered with more serious water stresses and strived for resource efficient industry from a legal perspective the country implemented its first edition of national water law in 1988 followed by several specific policies addressing water conservation water pollution prevention etc the developed legal framework significantly promoted improvement of water recycling technology within industrial factories the allocation of limited water resources as well as stringent water use efficiency standards pushed local governments to reduce water intensive industries the increasing trend of irrigation water requirement was generally dominated by eia see blue line in fig 6 the strong fluctuation of irrigation water withdrawal was driven by climatic variability the large scale of water withdrawals coincided with dry climate and vice versa total water withdrawal showed upward variations in all seasons in terms of percentage of variations while annual domestic and industrial water withdrawal were evenly allocated within one year see fig 7 the increases in major crop growing season mainly in summer were marked the spatial distribution of variations of total water withdrawal in sub basins as displayed in fig 8 a highlights the dominant regions experiencing intensified water use activities mainly in the southern and eastern part of the basin previous investigation on pet by using various trend detection methods have shown consistent agreement on finding major upward trends concentrated on the southern region wang et al 2015b the increased evapotranspiration led to more irrigation water requirements which explained the considerable water use increments in this area the eastern region is a very densely populated area e g chongqing megacity and is very appropriate for agricultural activities e g sichuan basin the high total water withdrawal is driven by high population as well as cropping density 4 3 variations in natural runoff by means of monthly hydrological modelling it is ideal to obtain the temporal variations of natural inflow to the tgr see fig 7 as well as the spatial distribution of natural runoff variations in the basin see fig 8b and c it is noteworthy that both of them enhanced the policy makers understanding regarding the natural hydrological response to climate variability according to simulated natural inflow all seasonal inflows became lower the negative change in autumn was significant being assorted with the variation in precipitation in winter the magnitude of rising pet outweighed the precipitation increases leading to downward changes of natural inflow the observed inflow fig 4a and the simulated natural inflow fig 7 have close downward variation at the annual time scale 27 gm3 and 21 gm3 however this concurrence did not happen in different seasons in the low flow seasons spring and winter additional water compensated for natural inflow losses so that more water entered into the tgr during the impact period than the baseline period in practice in the high flow seasons summer and autumn the observed inflow declined by 6 gm3 and 24 gm3 obviously exceeding variations in natural inflow 2 gm3 and 15 gm3 both of these values demonstrate that non climatic factors have also apparently reallocated seasonal inflows to the tgr another notable issue is the absence of considerable increasing trends in natural inflow in the main flooding of summer that could be expected based on observed precipitation changes jiang et al 2008 2007 and the corresponding natural runoff xu et al 2008 which was based on 1961 2000 datasets the trends greatly weakened when the time series were extended to 1961 2015 in the present study it casts doubt on whether the upper yangtze river has been experienced more severe flood hazards in recent decades concerning that one of the major tasks of the tgr is flood attenuation to answer this question it requires a further study with an emphasis on investigating variations in frequency and intensity of flood hazards herein it is worth mentioning that the intensification of floods is not necessarily associated with the larger amount of seasonal mean value in recent decades the regime of floods might have been characterized by higher intensity along with shorten duration as it was found in precipitation in several parts of the yangtze river zhang et al 2013 regarding the spatial distribution of annual natural runoff see fig 8b decreases were mainly concentrated on the plain area of sichuan basin eastern region with an area over the upper reaches of jialingjiang river north eastern region where the percentage of variation exceeded 15 however in autumn see fig 8c the area of decreases were more widespread particularly significant in the area around the upper reaches of yangtze river and the wujiang river hachured areas these are economically highly developed regions in western china with megacities and large irrigation areas more noteworthy is these regions also suffered from the most significant intensification of water use activities of the basin as it was identified in fig 8a addressing autumn water shortages could become a consequent issue if natural runoff decreases continue 4 4 water storage increments of upstream reservoirs in the impact period as for evaluating inflow variation regulated by upstream reservoirs the simulated water storage increments of upstream reservoirs required verification the cumulative annual and autumn increments in reservoir water storage were correlated with the cumulative capacity of large reservoirs upstream of the tgr shown in fig 9 the strong linear correlations along with extremely low significance levels indicated that the simulated impact of reservoir operation approximated the real world cases the upstream reservoirs affected inflow to the tgr by transferring water among seasons along with raising evaporation losses as well as impounding reservoirs the multiyear average value of seasonal increments in upstream reservoir storages clearly reflected their general principle of operation as shown in fig 10 that is from the previous winter to the next spring the stored water were gradually released to generate electricity and satisfy water demand and meanwhile the water level of reservoir was kept as high as possible to gain sufficient water head for hydraulic generator as well as maintaining navigation conditions during the flood season of summer most reservoirs were operated at a low flood control level to reserve enough spaces for flood peak attenuation while some of them began to impound floodwaters in advance in autumn the regulated water storages were again filled in preparation for the coming low flow season collectively the amount of water impounded in the wet season exceeded the amount of water released in the dry season over the impact period around 2 gm3 inflow to the tgr on multi year average were annually lost due to the combined effects of increasing evaporation and the initial filling of reservoirs from a regional perspective the total reservoir storage capacity of jinshajiang and yalongjiang rivers was obviously larger than other tributaries in autumn the reservoirs have retained 3 8 gm3 water on multi year average which almost reached sum of others in the basin see fig 11 to sustain the planning projects that divert water from yalongjiang river to northwest china and from jinshajiang river to central yunnan province more reservoirs will be built in this sub basin in preparation for storing an additional 20 4 gm3 water annually these reservoirs will act to further reduce inflow to the tgr in the coming decades 4 5 main causes of annual and autumn inflow reductions herein we discuss the attribution for decreasing annual and autumn inflow table 3 shows the magnitude of annual and seasonal variations during the baseline period in which the effect of reservoir operation was minor the simulated total inflows natural inflow less water consumption were very close to the observations simulations slightly overestimated total inflow by 0 7 1 gm3 in autumn and 0 9 4 gm3 on mean annual statistic where the errors were much smaller than the magnitude of reductions observed over the impact period furthermore the observed variations in total inflow were well replicated by the summation of simulated variations in natural inflow water consumption as well as water storage increments of upstream reservoirs it reinforces confidence in the methods applied to properly quantify the contribution of three impact factors fig 12 further helps illustrate a relative comparison between cumulative inflow gains and losses over the impact period one general point becomes very clear that climate variability dominated annual and autumn inflow reduction meanwhile the fact deserved explicit emphasis that human activities were obviously enhanced even though their contributions are still complementary according to the numerical simulation results the drier climate was responsible for 78 of the annual inflow decrease while the effects of water consumption and upstream reservoir operation were accounted for 15 and 7 respectively to be more specific the percentage due to sectoral water consumption was 10 for irrigation 4 for domestic and 1 for industrial sectors see fig 13 a in autumn the drier climate accounted for 63 of the inflow reduction around 33 of the decrease arose from water impoundment from upstream reservoirs while 4 of which can be attributed to the increased water consumption see fig 13b for other seasons human activities contributed to a comparable or greater share of inflow variations particularly in winter when water released from upstream reservoirs was the main reason for inflow enhancement however it is noteworthy that the magnitude of inflow variations in these seasons were remarkably lower than that in autumn 4 6 uncertainties of the attribution results we should clearly pointed out that there are uncertainties associated with numerical modelling for the attribution results we did not include considerations for small reservoirs in the framework of our reservoir operation model the majority of these reservoirs were lack of actual operation data and were run of river projects that had minor effects on seasonal streamflow the water use model can be improved by introducing the spatial distribution of population electricity generation effective irrigation area and cropping pattern with higher resolution future work requires more reliable and multi source data involved in the reservoir operation model to improve the simulation accuracy the effect of man made land use and land cover changes luccs were omitted in the simplification of lumped hydrological model luccs is a complex process which is affected by both natural variability socioeconomic development and water policy the predominant land use change was farmland the diminishing farmland contributed to the recovery of forest vegetation and the expansion of urban land the afforestation program increased vegetation cover and can reduce annual water yield the urbanization program increased impervious area and would lead to an increase in the runoff yield meanwhile the government set the minimum amount of arable land to ensure food security based on the present study more comprehensive analyses on identifying the individual and combined effects of luccs on local climate and runoff generation can assist in refining the attribution of hydrological changes 5 conclusions the tgr is a major alternative energy source serving to supply growing electricity demand of china nevertheless inflow reductions after the design period 1961 1990 have recently reduced its capability to fulfil the designed electricity generation in the following decades 1991 2015 the tgr has lost 6 of annual inflow accounting for approximately 70 of its total storage capacity during the main season of water impoundment inflow in autumn significantly reduced by 16 this study was aimed at identifying inflow variations that have occurred between the baseline period 1961 1990 and the impact period 1991 2015 in association with climate variability water consumption and upstream reservoir operation it could be concluded that the drier climate was the main cause for decreasing annual and autumn inflow although the rising water consumption was impressive however the magnitude of its increment has not prevailed climate induced variation upstream reservoir operation cannot be cited as the major driving force for decreasing autumn inflow either around one half upstream large reservoirs have just put into practice in the recent 5 years 2011 2015 that cannot properly explain previous inflow variations specifically the relative contribution rates of climate variability water consumption and upstream reservoir operation aiming to decrease annual inflow are 78 15 and 7 respectively while those rates leading to reduce autumn inflow are 63 4 and 33 respectively the climatic impact is still a primary consideration for framing adaptive operation strategy of the tgr in response to negative consequences of inflow variations despite intensified human activities given that autumn inflow reduction is significant and is often attributed to the drier climate that are plausible to last for another decade it is recommended to move the starting time of tgr water impoundment ahead to early autumn to reach normal water storage in time among water consumption sectors retrofitting of irrigation system with modernized water saving technology is an efficient approach to mitigate inflow losses because of a large amount of irrigation water consumption in the total amount of consumptive water besides the upstream reservoirs should be operated in an adaptive manner to avoid retaining autumn inflow simultaneously the study suggested a stepwise procedure with incorporation of water use and hydrological and reservoir operation models to identify the main reason for streamflow variation this approach offers merits in two respects first it explicitly considers water consumption on the baseline period rather than arbitrarily ignores its effect secondly major human activities including water consumption and reservoir regulation are quantitatively isolated so they could be well managed regarding each property furthermore the models can lay a groundwork for projections of regional water availability and demand balances for the next studies the proposed procedure can be extended to more catchments along with prevailing reservoir regulation and water abstraction and it is expected to provide more information for management of regional water resources being resilient to the change of streamflow pattern declaration of competing interest

6062,detection and attribution of streamflow changes would be a standing point towards optimizing the management of basin scale water resources the three gorges reservoir tgr the largest hydropower project worldwide has recently experienced obvious inflow reduction which has restricted its capability to achieve the designed electricity generation this study considered the design period of tgr 1961 1990 as the baseline period for evaluating inflow variations during the subsequent impact period 1991 2015 annual inflow reduced by 6 and seasonal inflow significantly decreased by 16 in autumn which is the main season for filling reservoir a new stepwise procedure with the help of a water use model a lumped hydrological model and a generic reservoir operation model is presented to unravel the causes of inflow reduction results revealed that the drier climate predominantly caused inflow decreases human activities have notably enhanced in recent decades however they have not posed significant threats to inflow deficiency climate variability water consumption and upstream reservoir operation contributed by 78 15 and 7 to decrease annual inflow while they contributed by 63 4 and 33 to reduce autumn inflow respectively the proposed procedure can quantitatively disentangle major human impacts including water consumption and reservoir regulation such information enriches policy makers knowledge for framing delicacy management of regional human activities in response to changing streamflow pattern keywords three gorges reservoir inflow variation climate variability water consumption reservoir operation 1 introduction attribution of past changes in river streamflow associated with alteration in climate condition and human activities has recently attracted several scholars attention dey and mishra 2017 roderick and farquhar 2011 wang 2014 wu et al 2017 these researches are mainly motivated by the consensus that decomposition of streamflow changes shed light on the hydrological response to climatic or human s changes in the catchment however whether the magnitude and timing of streamflow fluctuate beyond the envelope of historical variability has still remained unclear and if so why is very relevant for framing adaptation strategies in terms of regional water resources planning and management it was reported that several major rivers in china have experienced downward trends of streamflow li et al 2017 wang et al 2015a xu et al 2014 zhai and tao 2017 and the yangtze river that is the largest river in china was even no exception its annual discharge has monotonically decreased by 11 over the industrial period 1865 2008 at the most seaward gauging station yang et al 2010 this negative change has been a serious challenge accompanying with provision of sustainable water resources for human consumption food production electricity generation etc the three gorges reservoir tgr which is fed by the runoff from almost the entire upper catchment of the yangtze river indeed suffers from reduction of inflow at present the tgr is the largest hydropower project worldwide and it is also a strategic and ambitious contribution to meet the growing electricity demands of china territory accounting for 14 of china s total hydropower generation iha 2013 however the tgr has failed to accomplish its designed electricity generation twice in four years due to lower inflow than that in a normal year since it was entered into full operation during 2012 2015 ctg 2013 2016 while the side effects of its operation on altering the downstream flow regime has greatly attracted public attention e g aggravating downstream hydrological droughts li et al 2013 extremely low water levels lai et al 2014 and environmental flow deficit wang et al 2018 during the period of water impoundment little attention has been paid to inflow variations and their causes from the upstream area hence such information may realize the development of adaptive measures to mitigate a possible decline in hydropower generation caused by inflow variations both climate variability and human activities play crucial role in the change of hydrological regime in recent decades human activities have become increasingly extensive in the upper yangtze river especially after chinese economic reform in 1978 the booming economy inevitably increased water demands to meet the needs of households manufacturing electricity and food production etc which directly altered temporal distribution of streamflow via water withdrawal and reservoirs regulation nilsson et al 2005 categorized the yangtze as one of the 104 world s large river systems that have been strongly affected by constructed dams according to the extent of channel fragmentation and flow regulation in particular in the upper yangtze river total storage capacity of large reservoirs may rise up to 61 of annual runoff in case of on time completion of all dams whose are under planning and construction zhang et al 2012 alcamo et al 2003b presented a business as usual scenario of continuing demographic economic and technological trends up to 2025 including the yangtze river they estimated that the growth of water demand would outweigh the assumed improvement in water use efficiency indicating higher pressure on available water along with intensified human activities changes in climatic variables have also been detected in the upper yangtze river the basin was found to be dominated by an upward temperature trend as well as a downward precipitation trend chen et al 2014 zhang et al 2005 against the backdrop of global warming the mean annual temperature has increased by 0 8 c while precipitation has decreased by 3 over the period of 1955 2014 chen et al 2016 this warming and drier climate may similarly continue for another decade until 2030 based on processed global climate model outputs in the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 sun et al 2015 some efforts have been made to identify major causes for streamflow decreases however the conclusions were spatially inconsistent in different sub catchments within the yangtze river basin for example in one hand yang et al 2015 attributed 61 of runoff decline for the entire river basin during post tgr decade 2003 2012 to a reduction in precipitation when that is relative to the pre tgr decade 1993 2002 this is also the case in hanjiang a tributary of the yangtze where climate variation accounted for 84 90 of the runoff reduction in 1991 2006 compared with the period of 1951 1989 liu et al 2012 on the other hand zhang et al 2015 reported that human activities have become dominant driving forces in the upper and middle yangtze river since 1961 hence specific investigations on the inflow variations regarding the tgr and their causes are still indispensable in an attempt made to differentiate the influence of climate variability and human activities on streamflow variations hydrological modelling mass balance and regression approach have been already utilized ahn and merwade 2014 wu et al 2017 these approaches normally share a common rationale that a baseline or a near pristine period can be determined with negligible human activities so that an empirical or a physically based hydrological model could be set up on the basis of runoff observations to estimate climate induced variations of streamflow the discrepancy between the observed variation of streamflow and the climate induced variation is attributed to human activities however the majority of rivers have a long history of human activities that affect their streamflow patterns in particular water abstraction the absolute ignorance of human activities during the baseline period will over or under estimate human influences depending on how pre inflection human activities affect streamflow dey and mishra 2017 wang 2014 zhang et al 2016 moreover disentangling of two major impacts of direct human activities i e water consumption and reservoir regulation is of great significance for policy makers wada et al 2016 therefore this study recommended a stepwise procedure to estimate absolute streamflow variation caused by climate variability water consumption and reservoir regulation it was also attempted to back calculate regional water uses over the entire study period by the use of a global water assessment model called watergap 2 doll et al 2003 by excluding human influences during the baseline period natural runoff process was reconstructed based on a lumped hydrological model in addition a generic reservoir operation model was applied to simulate water storage increments of upstream reservoirs for an impact period with dramatic dam construction consequently the annual and seasonal inflow variations induced by climate variability could be quantified involving water consumption and upstream reservoir operation between the baseline and the impact period the practical purpose of the present study was to identify dominant factors causing decline in annual and autumn inflow to the tgr the procedure proposed for quantifying the role of climate and direct human impacts on streamflow can potentially be applied in catchments along with multi reservoirs and non negligible water abstraction 2 regional setting and datasets 2 1 the upper yangtze river basin the main course of yangtze river originates from the qinghai tibet plateau and flows 6300 km eastward to the east china sea its upper basin lies in the transition zone from the west high alpine terrain to the east low plain in which the corresponding elevation ranges from 5000 m above sea level at headwater section to below 500 m near yichang a hydrological gauging station dividing yangtze river into the upper and lower sections the tgr 111 0 e 30 82 n has been located at the downstream end of the upper yangtze river basin see fig 1 and it receives discharge from a drainage area of 1 006 mkm2 with mean annual total streamflow of about 427 gm3 1961 2015 which accounted for approximately 50 of the yangtze river s total streamflow as a result of the abundant water resources and steep river slopes the upper yangtze river has a tremendous potential for hydropower generation six tributaries jinshajiang river yalongjiang river daduhe river minjiang river jialingjiang river and wujiang river in addition to the up reaches of yangtze river are extensively used for hydropower exploitation huang and yan 2009 the tgr is the first reservoir providing carryover storage over multiple seasons in the main reaches of yangtze accompanying with impressively large storage capacity 39 3 gm3 by global standards however in terms of hydrology the tgr can only store 9 and also regulate 4 of the mean annual total inflow thus its hydropower potential is firmly dependent on the allocation of seasonal inflows which is highly uneven as a consequence of the monsoon climate dominating the majority of the basin annual and monthly mean of precipitation potential evapotranspiration pet for the upper yangtze river and the observed inflow to the tgr are listed in table 1 in a normal year the subtropical monsoon transports a huge amount of atmospheric moisture from the east and south china sea to the basin during april to october thus the inflow is mainly concentrated on mid summer and early autumn from july to september accounting for nearly one half of the total rate per year however the tgr does not store water until the period of mid autumn october to reserve capacity for attenuating summer floods thus the hydropower potential of tgr is particularly sensitive to the inflow variations in autumn 2 2 major human activities in the basin socioeconomic development after china stabilized around 1960s major socioeconomic indicators of the basin such as gross domestic product gdp population electricity production as well as effective irrigation area eia have continuously increased for over more than half a century according to the census as shown in fig 2 a regional population has been doubled to 173 million within 55 years even though the rate of population growth remarkably slowed down after the 1980s when one child policy was implemented to sustain this population growth the eia for food supply has increased by 2 4 times from 21 103 km2 in 1961 to 51 103 km2 in 2015 see fig 2b as a measure of people s productive activity the rate of gdp growth is impressive as well it is noteworthy that the annual growth rate of gdp in china was continually higher than 6 5 from the 1990s onward in addition the growth of electricity production was in consistent with the gdp rate the rapid increase in the above mentioned factors implies more extensive water use activities and non negligible growth of freshwater consumption abstracted from river network reservoir construction the storage delays in reservoirs not only redistribute seasonal streamflow but also result in water loss through increasing water surface evaporation as well as initial filling of reservoirs over the period of 1990 2015 several construction projects related to large dams were completed or being constructed in the basin their main utilizations were hydropower generation flood control and irrigation up to 2015 the basin upstream of the tgr involved 35 large reservoirs with an installed power generation capacity in excess of 300 mw in operation the cumulative total and regulated storage capacity had reached 68 and 35 gm3 respectively which are about twice the ones of the tgr as illustrated in fig 2c 2 3 datasets data applied in the analyses consist of three categories reservoir information hydrometeorological observations and water use and socio economic data general information belonged to 36 large reservoirs including the tgr was extracted from the 4th national survey on hydroelectric resources published in 2005 and almanac of china s water power 1961 2015 data belonged to each reservoir described geographical location year of initial operation catchment area riverbed slope and total storage capacity see table s1 according to the location of 36 large reservoirs and 5 hydrological stations yichang is not included the upper yangtze river was divided into 41 sub basins as shown in fig 3 monthly discharge data at five gauging stations including pingshan gaochang fushun beibei and wulong in the upper yangtze river basin were collected to calibrate the water balance model for major tributaries of the basin see fig 1 on the main reaches between the tgr and yichang station there was indeed a reservoir being operated named gezhouba however it was a run of river hydroelectric project without a notable impact on seasonal streamflow consequently historical records at yichang station were served as a practical estimate of virtual inflow to the tgr before the dam being constructed in june 2003 afterwards observed inflow to the tgr was compiled from china three gorges corporation as a chinese state owned power company monthly observations of meteorological data belonging to 75 stations are plotted in fig 3 which acquired from the national climate center of china meteorological administration daily pet was determined for each station using the penman monteith method monthly pet was computed by accumulating the daily values general description of the penman monteith method was given in supplementary evidences the thiessen polygon method was used to calculate basin wide precipitation and pet data over the time as well the values of population eia and electricity production were gathered from the provincial statistical yearbooks of 9 provinces in mainland china qinghai tibet sichuan yunnan chongqing gansu shaanxi guizhou and hubei describing upstream tributaries of the tgr assume that population eia and electricity production are evenly distributed within each province then their basin wide value can be derived from multiplying the density by the area of each province located in the basin it was herein attempted to apply china s gdp per capita constant 2005 us derived from world bank national accounts data http geodata grid unep ch as a surrogate for basin wide value annual national water withdrawal data were collected on the basis of china statistical yearbooks published since 2000 for calibrating industrial and domestic use models data on regional total water withdrawal and consumption in the upper yangtze river were collected from changjiang and southwest river water resources bulletin 1998 2015 which serve to cross check on the total water withdrawal simulation the period of study and analysis includes the baseline period 1961 1990 and the impact period 1991 2015 the year of 1990 is a milestone with regard to human activities in the region as it is the year from which on economic growth and dam construction began to accelerate in addition the tgr was designed before 1990 thus understanding of main causes of inflow variations after the design period is crucial to design an optimal reservoir operation strategy 3 methods 3 1 statistical analysis for detecting abrupt changes the pettitt test was used to identify abrupt changes in hydrometeorological variables the test is widely used in the stochastic analysis to detect abrupt changes in the mean distribution of the variable of interest due to its robustness for data distribution skewness under the null hypothesis of no change rougé et al 2013 xie et al 2014 the mann whitney u test was utilized for testing two samples before and after the change point obtained from the same distribution in which a change point was selected maximizing the statistic the pettitt s statistics u τ n were derived from the rank based comparison between observations with length of n before and after a specific time τ which could be defined as follows 1 u τ n i 1 τ j τ 1 n sgn x j x i where sgn θ 1 if θ 0 0 if θ 0 and 1 if θ 0 once a potential change point is specified e g the year of 1990 the confidence probability of change can be quantified as 2 p 1 2 exp 6 u τ n 2 n 2 n 3 given a critical level of confidence 1 α that usually equals 95 if p 1 α the null hypothesis is rejected and it can be inferred that a significant change has occurred at the point τ the pettitt test may lead to misleading results when hydrometeorological data are auto correlated to overcome this weakness we followed the tfpwcu procedure i e trend free prewhitening along with residuals correction and unbiased estimation of autocorrelation coefficient to mitigate the adverse effect of autocorrelation on assessing the confidence probability of change serinaldi and kilsby 2016 the original data was whitened via a short term persistence process lag one autoregressive ar1 and a long term persistence process fractional gaussian noise fgn respectively before implementing the pettitt test significant changes were reported only if the ar 1 based and fgn based prewhitening approaches reached an agreement see table s2 3 2 quantitative assessment of inflow variations 3 2 1 general framework for quantifying the attribution to inflow changes to differentiate and quantify the relative importance of major factors influencing inflow the water balance equation needs to be developed that is described as 3 i tgr q nat q use δ s res where i tgr is the monthly total inflow to the tgr q nat and q use denote the natural runoff and the water consumption in the basin respectively and δ s res represents the monthly increments in water storage of upstream reservoirs and it is positive while more water is stored in the reservoirs at the end of the month than at the beginning the equation was established regarding the basic assumption that climate variability water consumption and upstream reservoir operation were only drivers for monthly inflow to the tgr thus the variations in natural runoff water consumption and water storage increments of upstream reservoirs were accurately simulated and compared so as to assess their relative contributions to total inflow changes the procedure for calibrating and validating models to reproduce historical variations of the three mentioned impact factors are outlined as follows step 1 water use reconstruction the water use model was calibrated based on water use records 2000 2015 and then was applied to reconstruct water uses over the whole study period 1961 2015 step 2 natural runoff simulation the baseline period 1961 1990 was divided into calibration 1961 1980 and validation 1981 1990 phases to calibrate and validate the hydrological model parameters during the baseline period only 3 out of 35 reservoirs were in operation their cumulative total storage capacities take less than one percent of the annual inflow to the tgr see fig 2c consequently the differences between the observed inflow and the simulated water consumption were calculated to present reliable references for calibrating hydrological model so as to create natural runoff for the entire study period step 3 reservoir regulation estimation the reservoir operation model was calibrated against the estimated monthly water storage increments of upstream reservoirs δ s res in the impact period the estimated δ s res were calculated by subtracting the simulated water consumption and natural runoff obtained from the observed inflow if the model was capable of reproducing these estimation values climate variability water consumption and upstream reservoir operation would be taken as the major factors into account influencing monthly inflow variations otherwise we might suspect that there were other effective factors which were not considered by the aforementioned water balance equation eq 3 we should not overlook that model validation is also an essential procedure for water use model and reservoir operation model with regard to water use model water withdrawal in each sector was calibrated according to national statistics while their totality was verified in reference to total water withdrawal documented in regional statistics as actual reservoir operation data are scattered over independent companies which can hardly be gathered we resorted to the cumulative storage capacity of these reservoirs as a surrogate for reflecting the general impact of reservoir operation the growth of cumulative storage capacity over time was applied to verify the output of reservoir operation model i e cumulative water storage increments of upstream reservoirs 3 2 2 water use model the water use model of watergap2 was used to simulate water withdrawal in major water use sectors e g domestic industry and irrigation water consumption was considered as the part of the withdrawn water that was consumed through evapotranspiration incorporating into manufacture crops and humans the water consumption was estimated q use eq 3 by applying the multi year average value of consumptive uses ratio i e 45 which was collected from the changjiang and southwest river water resources bulletin 1998 2015 the mentioned model could estimate withdrawn water based on the water use intensity in each sector and corresponding driving force the driving forces of water use refer to population in the domestic sector electricity generation in the industrial sector and eia in the irrigation sector the domestic and industrial water intensities were modeled by considering variations in structure and technology of water use according to the data describing global water use trends alcamo et al 2003a suggested a sigmoid curve to describe the structural water use intensity in the domestic sector m3 person and a hyperbolic curve to describe the structural water use intensity in the industrial sector m3 mwh denoted by dswi and iswi respectively 4 dswi d s w i min d s w i max 1 exp r dom g d p 2 5 iswi 1 r ind gdp g d p min i s w i min where gdp is the per capita annual gdp us year r dom and r ind are dimensionless curve parameters that require calibration further accounting for technological change improving water use efficiency and dswi and iswi can be computed by 6 dwi d s w i 1 η dom t t 0 7 iwi i s w i 1 η ind t t 0 where η dom and η ind are the annual rates of decrease in structural water use intensity year t 0 is the time when technological change is taken into account here it was attempted to assume t 0 1980 η dom and η ind equal 0 6 that is consistent with the reports for hindcasting and projecting of global water uses published by florke et al 2013 and wada et al 2016 the irrigation water intensity is the irrigation of water requirement per unit of crop land mm km2 it is computed for each month of the growing season as the difference between the crop water requirement and the available soil moisture supplied by precipitation 8 irwi k c e pet p avail η irri where η irri is the ratio of irrigation water consumption over withdrawal in absence of detail data on measuring improvement in irrigation water use efficiency it could be assumed that η irri would be the same as the basin wide consumptive uses ratio i e 45 p avail is the effective precipitation available to the crop that was estimated on the basis of the united states department of agriculture usda soil conservation service method scs e pet denotes the pet the non dimensional crop coefficient k c was set for the five growing months as 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 0 8 for paddy situations doll and siebert 2002 we assumed the cropping pattern to be paddy rice over the effective irrigation area because the basin is among the major paddy rice cropping areas of the country the growing season was determined using a rule based algorithm incorporating the site specific meteorological conditions doll and siebert 2002 sectoral water intensities multiplied by driving forces yielded the withdrawn water both of the domestic industrial and irrigation water withdrawals were calculated in each sub basin and then aggregated to the whole basin scale 3 2 3 monthly hydrological model for assessing hydrological consequences of climate variability a lumped monthly rainfall runoff model was employed which initially proposed by xiong and guo 1999 and guo 2002 and that is appropriate for using in the humid and semi humid region of china this two parameter model namely xiong model considers runoff as a single component it offers parsimonious yet refined structure to describe monthly runoff generation process and simplifies model s calibration its high efficiency in reproducing historical monthly runoff has been proved in more than 100 basins in china multi model comparison results revealed that two parameter models e g xiong model are perfect to achieve a comparable or even better performance than complex models reflecting that the objective is proper e g construction of monthly natural runoff that is driven by historical or projected variations of climatic variables bai et al 2015 the structure of model consists of two fundamental functions for simulating actual evapotranspiration e act and natural runoff q nat eq 3 at the t th month which are given as 9 e act t c e pan t tanh p t e pan t 10 q nat t s soil t 1 p t e act t tanh s soil t 1 p t e act t sc 11 s soil t s soil t 1 p t e act t q nat t where climatic inputs precipitation p and pan evaporation e pan determine water limited and energy limited conditions for the model respectively without changing physical meaning pet was adopted instead of pan evaporation as the energy boundary to restrict the actual evapotranspiration the quantity of the remaining water in the soil after the evaporation losses is determined by the term s soil t 1 p t e act t with s soil t 1 being soil water content at the end of the t 1 th month soil water content at the end of the next month s soil t is calculated according to the water conservation law eq 11 the evaporation coefficient c and the field capacity sc are model parameters which were calibrated based on two assessment criterion including nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and water balance error wbe the ranges and optimized values of the model parameters are given in table 2 3 2 4 reservoir operation model generic reservoir operation models are often adopted solutions to comprehensively assess the large scale hydrologic alterations caused by multi reservoirs using limited information including reservoir specifications inflow generation and water demand doll et al 2009 ehsani et al 2016 in this study the algorithm developed by hanasaki et al 2006 was used to simulate the process of reservoir outflows the algorithm presents a representative operation scheme diverting excess water from the wet season to the dry season in addition to fulfilling downstream water requirements this scheme does not necessary be the same as the actual operation rules at each reservoir however it reflects the general principle of reservoir regulation as such the monthly release r is parameterized as 12 r α 0 5 2 k y r p 1 α 0 5 2 i res 0 α 0 5 k y r p α 0 5 where α denotes the total storage capacity to mean total annual inflow ratio k y is the release coefficient reflecting initial storage in the y th operational year i res is the monthly inflow and r p is the provisional monthly release accounting for mean annual inflow and fluctuations in downstream water requirements herein downstream refers to the downward area to the next reservoir or if there was no further reservoir to the outlet of the basin apart from hanasaki et al s scheme 2006 evaporation losses were regarded from water surface of large reservoirs the difference between the potential and actual evapotranspiration was added to the water balance of reservoirs thus taking into account the landscape change from land to open water body reservoir evaporation is directly proportional to reservoir surface area however this requires establishing a geometrical relationship to translate reservoir storage volume to surface area for that purpose it was attempted to select a tetrahedron shape with isosceles triangles proposed by fekete et al 2010 to compute the reservoir surface area as a function of the storage the monthly increments in water storage of upstream reservoirs δ s res as previously defined in eq 3 was then calculated according to the water balance of reservoirs which is expressed as 13 δ s res upstream i res e res β r s dead s res δ s res s total where the term upstream indicates integration over the basin upstream of the tgr e res denotes the increased evaporation losses s res is water content in reservoirs at the beginning of the month the reservoir storage may vary from dead storage s dead to total storage s total herein β is a dimensionless coefficient for correcting monthly releases and it is used to account for the impact of human s decisions on monthly releases after calibration it was revealed that β was in the range between 0 5 and 2 5 among different months with a β below 0 5 no more inflow can be stored as the reservoir has been filled while with a β above 2 5 no more release is produced as the reservoir is nearly empty therefore if β is inside the range of 0 5 2 5 that may prevent the reservoir operation model from reproducing monthly releases in an unrealistic manner 4 results and discussion 4 1 the observed inflow variations precipitation and pet the pettitt test was utilized to evaluate the confidence probability of abrupt changes in the mean value of annual and seasonal inflows precipitation and pet from the baseline period to the impact period fig 4 depicts the computed magnitude percentage and probability of the variations in comparison with the baseline period annual inflow was 27 gm3 6 lower during the impact period this magnitude of reduction accounts for nearly 70 of total storage capacity of the tgr that has practical significance for hydropower generation considering the intra annual variability seasonal inflows were stable in spring march may and became slightly lower in summer june august and higher in winter december february significant inflow variations occurred in autumn september november with a decrease of 24 gm3 16 according to the variations were shown in climatic variables seasonal precipitation did not remarkably change during spring and summer however it became slightly larger in winter and significantly smaller in autumn autumn precipitation decreased by 19 mm 9 annual precipitation declined insignificantly by 18 mm 2 changes in pet were positive in all seasons rising pet neutralized increase of precipitation in winter and emphasized the aggravation of water loss in autumn autumn pet rose insignificantly by 4 mm 2 qualitatively the increased pet and decreased precipitation were consistent with annual and autumn inflow reductions however to find out whether climatic impact has dominated inflow changes it was attempted to resort to the numerical simulation results fig 5 presents the simulated total inflow as the summation of natural runoff and water consumption for the baseline period and by integrating monthly increments in upstream reservoir storage for the impact period calibration of the hydrological model was carried out from 1961 to 1980 and validation was from 1981 to 1990 it can be clearly seen that the simulated total inflow was well aligned with the observations in the baseline period the nse coefficient in the calibration and validation phases is 93 7 and 95 7 on the monthly time scale respectively the wbe coefficient for these two phases is 2 0 and 1 0 respectively by further involving the effects of reservoir operation the simulated total inflow excellently reproduces historical variations for the later impact period with nearly the same nse 93 1 and a better wbe 0 9 accordingly it is feasible to reliably investigate variations in each factor in order to assess their impacts on total inflow variations 4 2 variations in water use water use hindcasting presents widespread increases in domestic industrial and irrigation water withdrawals driven by growing population and rising prosperity the modeled temporal variations of sectoral water uses over the basin during the past 55 years are shown in fig 6 the overall regional water uses increased by 9 3 gm3 between the baseline and the impact period specifically regional domestic industrial and irrigation water uses increased by 2 7 gm3 0 4 gm3 and 6 2 gm3 respectively since there was no regional dataset reporting sectoral water uses the domestic and industrial water use models were calibrated based on input data derived from national statistical values that were rescaled to the upper yangtze river according to the density of population and electricity production the simulated domestic and industrial water withdrawal achieved a satisfactory agreement with the national statistics regional total water withdrawal published by changjiang and southwest river water resources bulletin was not incorporated into water use modelling thus it provided a reference to validate the performance of water use model fig 6 shows that the model outcomes reproduced the increasing water use trend that has been recorded between 1998 and 2015 during 1998 2015 the multiyear average value of simulated total water withdrawal was estimated to be 6 lower than the recorded data this underestimation can be ascribed to some minor water use sectors which were not explicitly considered in this study despite that the current simulation results well reflected the development of major sectoral water uses to be specific there was a flat increase of domestic water withdrawal between 1975 and 1990 owing to introduction of efficiency improvement see green line in fig 6 an increase was apparent again since 1990 mainly related to rising population and growing domestic structural water use intensity which may attribute to increasing demands for household water use appliances the household water use demands would eventually saturate with the growth in income as domestic water uses were stabilized around 2010 water withdrawn for industrial purposes peaked in 1980 reaching 13 gm3 per year followed by a decline until 2000 although the electricity production steadily rose during this time period see purple line in fig 6 after that industrial water withdrawal gradually recovered to 11 gm3 in 2015 both decreasing the structural water use intensity as well as improving water saving technologies slowed down the corresponding trend and even decreased industrial water withdrawal along with economic booming which began since 1980s china encountered with more serious water stresses and strived for resource efficient industry from a legal perspective the country implemented its first edition of national water law in 1988 followed by several specific policies addressing water conservation water pollution prevention etc the developed legal framework significantly promoted improvement of water recycling technology within industrial factories the allocation of limited water resources as well as stringent water use efficiency standards pushed local governments to reduce water intensive industries the increasing trend of irrigation water requirement was generally dominated by eia see blue line in fig 6 the strong fluctuation of irrigation water withdrawal was driven by climatic variability the large scale of water withdrawals coincided with dry climate and vice versa total water withdrawal showed upward variations in all seasons in terms of percentage of variations while annual domestic and industrial water withdrawal were evenly allocated within one year see fig 7 the increases in major crop growing season mainly in summer were marked the spatial distribution of variations of total water withdrawal in sub basins as displayed in fig 8 a highlights the dominant regions experiencing intensified water use activities mainly in the southern and eastern part of the basin previous investigation on pet by using various trend detection methods have shown consistent agreement on finding major upward trends concentrated on the southern region wang et al 2015b the increased evapotranspiration led to more irrigation water requirements which explained the considerable water use increments in this area the eastern region is a very densely populated area e g chongqing megacity and is very appropriate for agricultural activities e g sichuan basin the high total water withdrawal is driven by high population as well as cropping density 4 3 variations in natural runoff by means of monthly hydrological modelling it is ideal to obtain the temporal variations of natural inflow to the tgr see fig 7 as well as the spatial distribution of natural runoff variations in the basin see fig 8b and c it is noteworthy that both of them enhanced the policy makers understanding regarding the natural hydrological response to climate variability according to simulated natural inflow all seasonal inflows became lower the negative change in autumn was significant being assorted with the variation in precipitation in winter the magnitude of rising pet outweighed the precipitation increases leading to downward changes of natural inflow the observed inflow fig 4a and the simulated natural inflow fig 7 have close downward variation at the annual time scale 27 gm3 and 21 gm3 however this concurrence did not happen in different seasons in the low flow seasons spring and winter additional water compensated for natural inflow losses so that more water entered into the tgr during the impact period than the baseline period in practice in the high flow seasons summer and autumn the observed inflow declined by 6 gm3 and 24 gm3 obviously exceeding variations in natural inflow 2 gm3 and 15 gm3 both of these values demonstrate that non climatic factors have also apparently reallocated seasonal inflows to the tgr another notable issue is the absence of considerable increasing trends in natural inflow in the main flooding of summer that could be expected based on observed precipitation changes jiang et al 2008 2007 and the corresponding natural runoff xu et al 2008 which was based on 1961 2000 datasets the trends greatly weakened when the time series were extended to 1961 2015 in the present study it casts doubt on whether the upper yangtze river has been experienced more severe flood hazards in recent decades concerning that one of the major tasks of the tgr is flood attenuation to answer this question it requires a further study with an emphasis on investigating variations in frequency and intensity of flood hazards herein it is worth mentioning that the intensification of floods is not necessarily associated with the larger amount of seasonal mean value in recent decades the regime of floods might have been characterized by higher intensity along with shorten duration as it was found in precipitation in several parts of the yangtze river zhang et al 2013 regarding the spatial distribution of annual natural runoff see fig 8b decreases were mainly concentrated on the plain area of sichuan basin eastern region with an area over the upper reaches of jialingjiang river north eastern region where the percentage of variation exceeded 15 however in autumn see fig 8c the area of decreases were more widespread particularly significant in the area around the upper reaches of yangtze river and the wujiang river hachured areas these are economically highly developed regions in western china with megacities and large irrigation areas more noteworthy is these regions also suffered from the most significant intensification of water use activities of the basin as it was identified in fig 8a addressing autumn water shortages could become a consequent issue if natural runoff decreases continue 4 4 water storage increments of upstream reservoirs in the impact period as for evaluating inflow variation regulated by upstream reservoirs the simulated water storage increments of upstream reservoirs required verification the cumulative annual and autumn increments in reservoir water storage were correlated with the cumulative capacity of large reservoirs upstream of the tgr shown in fig 9 the strong linear correlations along with extremely low significance levels indicated that the simulated impact of reservoir operation approximated the real world cases the upstream reservoirs affected inflow to the tgr by transferring water among seasons along with raising evaporation losses as well as impounding reservoirs the multiyear average value of seasonal increments in upstream reservoir storages clearly reflected their general principle of operation as shown in fig 10 that is from the previous winter to the next spring the stored water were gradually released to generate electricity and satisfy water demand and meanwhile the water level of reservoir was kept as high as possible to gain sufficient water head for hydraulic generator as well as maintaining navigation conditions during the flood season of summer most reservoirs were operated at a low flood control level to reserve enough spaces for flood peak attenuation while some of them began to impound floodwaters in advance in autumn the regulated water storages were again filled in preparation for the coming low flow season collectively the amount of water impounded in the wet season exceeded the amount of water released in the dry season over the impact period around 2 gm3 inflow to the tgr on multi year average were annually lost due to the combined effects of increasing evaporation and the initial filling of reservoirs from a regional perspective the total reservoir storage capacity of jinshajiang and yalongjiang rivers was obviously larger than other tributaries in autumn the reservoirs have retained 3 8 gm3 water on multi year average which almost reached sum of others in the basin see fig 11 to sustain the planning projects that divert water from yalongjiang river to northwest china and from jinshajiang river to central yunnan province more reservoirs will be built in this sub basin in preparation for storing an additional 20 4 gm3 water annually these reservoirs will act to further reduce inflow to the tgr in the coming decades 4 5 main causes of annual and autumn inflow reductions herein we discuss the attribution for decreasing annual and autumn inflow table 3 shows the magnitude of annual and seasonal variations during the baseline period in which the effect of reservoir operation was minor the simulated total inflows natural inflow less water consumption were very close to the observations simulations slightly overestimated total inflow by 0 7 1 gm3 in autumn and 0 9 4 gm3 on mean annual statistic where the errors were much smaller than the magnitude of reductions observed over the impact period furthermore the observed variations in total inflow were well replicated by the summation of simulated variations in natural inflow water consumption as well as water storage increments of upstream reservoirs it reinforces confidence in the methods applied to properly quantify the contribution of three impact factors fig 12 further helps illustrate a relative comparison between cumulative inflow gains and losses over the impact period one general point becomes very clear that climate variability dominated annual and autumn inflow reduction meanwhile the fact deserved explicit emphasis that human activities were obviously enhanced even though their contributions are still complementary according to the numerical simulation results the drier climate was responsible for 78 of the annual inflow decrease while the effects of water consumption and upstream reservoir operation were accounted for 15 and 7 respectively to be more specific the percentage due to sectoral water consumption was 10 for irrigation 4 for domestic and 1 for industrial sectors see fig 13 a in autumn the drier climate accounted for 63 of the inflow reduction around 33 of the decrease arose from water impoundment from upstream reservoirs while 4 of which can be attributed to the increased water consumption see fig 13b for other seasons human activities contributed to a comparable or greater share of inflow variations particularly in winter when water released from upstream reservoirs was the main reason for inflow enhancement however it is noteworthy that the magnitude of inflow variations in these seasons were remarkably lower than that in autumn 4 6 uncertainties of the attribution results we should clearly pointed out that there are uncertainties associated with numerical modelling for the attribution results we did not include considerations for small reservoirs in the framework of our reservoir operation model the majority of these reservoirs were lack of actual operation data and were run of river projects that had minor effects on seasonal streamflow the water use model can be improved by introducing the spatial distribution of population electricity generation effective irrigation area and cropping pattern with higher resolution future work requires more reliable and multi source data involved in the reservoir operation model to improve the simulation accuracy the effect of man made land use and land cover changes luccs were omitted in the simplification of lumped hydrological model luccs is a complex process which is affected by both natural variability socioeconomic development and water policy the predominant land use change was farmland the diminishing farmland contributed to the recovery of forest vegetation and the expansion of urban land the afforestation program increased vegetation cover and can reduce annual water yield the urbanization program increased impervious area and would lead to an increase in the runoff yield meanwhile the government set the minimum amount of arable land to ensure food security based on the present study more comprehensive analyses on identifying the individual and combined effects of luccs on local climate and runoff generation can assist in refining the attribution of hydrological changes 5 conclusions the tgr is a major alternative energy source serving to supply growing electricity demand of china nevertheless inflow reductions after the design period 1961 1990 have recently reduced its capability to fulfil the designed electricity generation in the following decades 1991 2015 the tgr has lost 6 of annual inflow accounting for approximately 70 of its total storage capacity during the main season of water impoundment inflow in autumn significantly reduced by 16 this study was aimed at identifying inflow variations that have occurred between the baseline period 1961 1990 and the impact period 1991 2015 in association with climate variability water consumption and upstream reservoir operation it could be concluded that the drier climate was the main cause for decreasing annual and autumn inflow although the rising water consumption was impressive however the magnitude of its increment has not prevailed climate induced variation upstream reservoir operation cannot be cited as the major driving force for decreasing autumn inflow either around one half upstream large reservoirs have just put into practice in the recent 5 years 2011 2015 that cannot properly explain previous inflow variations specifically the relative contribution rates of climate variability water consumption and upstream reservoir operation aiming to decrease annual inflow are 78 15 and 7 respectively while those rates leading to reduce autumn inflow are 63 4 and 33 respectively the climatic impact is still a primary consideration for framing adaptive operation strategy of the tgr in response to negative consequences of inflow variations despite intensified human activities given that autumn inflow reduction is significant and is often attributed to the drier climate that are plausible to last for another decade it is recommended to move the starting time of tgr water impoundment ahead to early autumn to reach normal water storage in time among water consumption sectors retrofitting of irrigation system with modernized water saving technology is an efficient approach to mitigate inflow losses because of a large amount of irrigation water consumption in the total amount of consumptive water besides the upstream reservoirs should be operated in an adaptive manner to avoid retaining autumn inflow simultaneously the study suggested a stepwise procedure with incorporation of water use and hydrological and reservoir operation models to identify the main reason for streamflow variation this approach offers merits in two respects first it explicitly considers water consumption on the baseline period rather than arbitrarily ignores its effect secondly major human activities including water consumption and reservoir regulation are quantitatively isolated so they could be well managed regarding each property furthermore the models can lay a groundwork for projections of regional water availability and demand balances for the next studies the proposed procedure can be extended to more catchments along with prevailing reservoir regulation and water abstraction and it is expected to provide more information for management of regional water resources being resilient to the change of streamflow pattern declaration of competing interest

6063,the global expansion of irrigation based agricultural practices is causing an overexploitation of groundwater resources a thorough understanding of groundwater recharge processes is necessary for restoring groundwater and improving water resources management especially in desert oasis aquifers in endorheic basins in this paper the ejina oasis in the downstream of heihe river basin was selected as the representative case for such an endeavor based on stable isotopes and end member mixing analysis we found that the shallow groundwater was modern water with 13 originating from local precipitation and 87 from river water infiltration the semi confined groundwater is a mixture of shallow groundwater 30 lateral groundwater flowing from the middle heihe river basin mhr 52 and confined groundwater 18 confined groundwater was old water formed in paleo climatic humid and cold conditions shallow groundwater levels were restored substantially after implementation of the ecological water diversion project ewdp began in 2000 in the heihe river basin but the semi confined groundwater levels still declined slowly these different responses to ewdp are attributed to the differences in primary recharge sources of the two aquifers because river water infiltration was the main sources of shallow groundwater increases in river discharge into the ejina oasis resulted in increased shallow groundwater levels over a short time scale continued over pumping of groundwater for irrigation in the mhr reduced lateral groundwater flow into the lower heihe river basin which was the primary source of semi confined groundwater for successful groundwater restoration and maintenance of groundwater for the future ewdp implementation must integrate water management of river water and groundwater diversion across the whole basin our results can provide useful information on policy decision makers for sustainable use of water resources in the oases of other similar watersheds

been diverted to the oases of the middle reaches between 1960 and 1990 primarily due to expansion of the irrigated agriculture xi et al 2015 xu et al 2019 has resulted in decreased river discharge lowered groundwater levels dried out lakes and the degradation of important ecosystems in the ejina oasis at the downstream of the basin this situation not only dramatically increased the number of sandstorms in local region but also induced greater numbers of sandstorms in northern china feng et al 2013 to address these issues the ecological water diversion project ewdp in the heihe river basin was implemented in 2000 to increase the amount of water diverted to the ejina oasis to prevent further deterioration of the environment and restore the ecological and hydrological functions of the

ecological balance in the ejina oasis has attracted the attention of eco hydrological researchers for a long period of time but the focus on this specific region has increased more recently previous studies on the groundwater in the oasis can be summarized into the following three aspects first to explore the relationship between the groundwater levels variations and the vegetation changes zhu et

qualitatively describe the hydrogeological and geochemical characteristics of groundwater su et al 2007 wen et al 2008 wang et al 2014b zhao et al 2018 although the existing researches on the ejina oasis have provided useful insights into the restoration of shallow groundwater levels a quantitative estimation of the sources of groundwater recharge to both the shallow and semi confined aquifers is still necessary especially as the semi confined groundwater resources have become a more prominent sources of freshwater in the ejina oasis xi et al 2018 lacking definitive information about groundwater recharge sources government decision makers have not appropriately managed the health of these aquifers xi et al 2010 shen et al 2017 yu et al 2018 if this situation continues it is likely that the groundwater degradation in the semi confined aquifer will become an intractable problem for the ejina oasis the significant differences in isotopic compositions among precipitation surface

significant insights for creating sustainable water resources management plans guo et al 2019 in this paper a comprehensive analysis on the stable isotopic and geochemical methods as well as end member mixing analysis was conducted we aim to expand the body of knowledge about sources of groundwater recharge in the ejina oasis by 1 investigating the isotopic and geochemical signatures of shallow semi confined confined aquifers 2 quantifying the recharge sources of different aquifers and 3 exploring the responses of the shallow and semi confined aquifers to the ewdp implementation to inform integrated water resources management efforts our results will provide fundamental information on groundwater recharge sources in multiple aquifers system in the ejina oasis which can be used to optimize the strategies of ewdp on conjunctive management of surface water and groundwater and to explore a balance between recharge and abstraction of groundwater in heihe river basin with a much broader implications for other parts of the world with similar watersheds 2 study area 2 1 general setting the heihe river basin is the second largest endorheic basin in the arid region of northwestern china the river originates in the qilian mountains and then flows northward through the zhangye jiuquan jinta and dingxin oasis in the middle reaches and the ejina oasis in the lower reaches fig 1a and b in the ejina oasis the heihe river forks into eastern and western branches from the langxin mountains and then disappears in the east juyan lake and west juyan lake dried respectively fig 1a the main riverbeds are shallow and wide with sand and coarse sand substrate which promotes river water infiltration into the groundwater system wen et al 2008 groundwater is the major available water resource in the oasis the natural desert riparian woods and the nature desert ecosystem are dependent on the groundwater sources feng et al 2013 the level of groundwater is the key factor for keeping the stability of eco environment at the oasis shen et al 2017 the ejina oasis geographically consists of a series of middle and low denudation mountains and proluvial fan delta covering approximately 3 104 km2 the elevation declines from the langxin mountain 1200 m a s l in the southwest part of the oasis to the east juyan lake 850 m a s l in the northeast the oasis is surrounded by the gobi desert and the badain jaran desert fig 1b the ejina oasis is considered as an important ecological barrier against sandstorms due to the desert around the oasis is the main sources areas of sand storm in china the study area is dominated by an arid continental climate with broad variations in temperature and precipitation the mean annual temperature is 9 c with monthly average temperature ranges from 36 c to 42 c the mean annual precipitation is 33 mm but can be as high as 100 mm in the wettest years and only 7 mm in driest years the mean annual pan evaporation is about 3200 mm more than 70 of the annual precipitation falls between june and september and some precipitation events can cause floods and produce temporary streams 2 2 geological and hydrogeological setting the ejina oasis is a regional sag geotectonic basin the eastern margin is bounded by the hidden badain jaran desert fault the southern edge is linked with the fault of alashan uplift and the northern and western boundaries lie along the bedrock of adjacent mountains glacial and interglacial stages frequently alternated in the quaternary which led to intensive denudation and erosion in the qilian mountains the majority of the eroded materials were transported to the basin by the heihe river and the floods resulted in the formation of alluvial proluvial fans delta in the basin the impermeable basement rocks of the basin consist of sinian z and late jurassic j3 formations and the main aquifers overlying the basement rock are comprised of unconsolidated quaternary q sediments with pebbles sandstone medium fine sandstone sandy mudstone and mudstone fig 2 due to the effect of tectonic movement the sediments thickness has been increasing from the marginal to the central of the basin and the grain size of sediment has been decreasing from coarse sands in the southwest to fine sands in the northeast fig 2 however the coarse sediments were alternated with the fine materials in the vertical layers frequently owing to the runoff variations of the heihe river during the glacial and interglacial periods the quaternary sediments comprise the main aquifers in the ejina oasis due to their unconsolidated and high permeable nature fig 2 these are the most productive units and constitute the base of the groundwater reservoir based on the impact of geologic structures in the horizontal directions groundwater levels decline gradually from southern to northern as a result groundwater changes from shallow groundwater to semi confined and confined groundwater the groundwater in the ejina oasis flows from the southwest to the northeast with the hydraulic gradient ranging from 0 6 to over 1 qin et al 2012 in the vertical the aquifers vary from the single shallow aquifer in the southwest to the multiple aquifers of semi confined and confined groundwater in the northeast the shallow aquifers in the basin are no more than 30 m in depth and were distributed in the upper of discontinuous aquicludes the confined aquifer is more than 100 m underground with the continuous aquicludes covering on it resulting in very slow recharge rates the semi confined aquifer found between the shallow aquifer and confined aquifer and ranges between 30 m and 100 m underground fig 2 even though the hydraulic characteristics of the three aquifers are significantly different they exhibited close relationships in recharge origin and reserve conditions xi et al 2010 wang et al 2013 3 material and methods 3 1 sampling and analysis river water and groundwater samples were taken during august 2015 and july 2016 to document spatial variation in the isotopic and geochemical signatures in the middle reaches of the heihe river mhr and of the different aquifers in the ejina oasis we obtained 10 groundwater from deep wells with depths range from 60 to 120 m and 21 river water samples from the mhr and 76 groundwater samples from the ejina oasis including shallow n 33 well depths less than 30 m semi confined groundwater samples n 38 well depths range from 30 to 100 m and confined n 5 a sample from well with the depth over 100 m and four samples from artesian wells groundwater samples we also collected 10 precipitation samples from june to september in 2015 and 2016 at the ejina oasis and rainfall in the four months accounted for 89 and 83 of the annual precipitation respectively sample bottles were completely filled with water without headspace and sealed with a parafilm tape all samples were stored in hdpe bottles at 4 c until laboratory analyses the sampling sites were marked in the fig 1c in addition the 20 year data between 1990 and 2009 from four monitoring wells well a well b well c and well d was used to investigate the groundwater levels variations before and after the ewdp implementation the depth of well a well b well c and well d is 16 m 22 m 85 m and 70 m respectively the well a and well b are shallow groundwater and the semi confined groundwater was identified for well c and well d fig 2 the stable oxygen and hydrogen isotopic values of water samples were analyzed using gv isoprime continuous flow mass spectrometer cf irms at the key laboratory of ecohydrology of inland river basin chinese academy of sciences the oxygen stable isotope ratio values of the samples were measured using co2 h2o equilibration the hydrogen stable isotope ratio values were measured using cf irms the water sample equilibrated in a vial with h2 gas using platinum wire as the catalyst the results were expressed in concentrations per mil relative to the vienna standard mean ocean water v smow and symbolized as δ 18o and δd the systematic analytical errors for the δd and δ 18o values were 0 02 and 0 05 respectively electrical conductivity ec and ph were measured using hq40d portable electronic equipment hach usa the cl concentrations were measured with an analytical error of 0 2 by means of ion chromatography using an ics 2500 ion chromatograph dionex sunnyvale ca in the same laboratory 3 2 end member mixing analysis end member mixing analysis emma which is based on the mass balance of tracers was used to determine the potential sources contributing to river and groundwater samples and to evaluate the contribution of each source to groundwater recharge the method is described as the following equation 1 q t m 1 n q m q t c t j m 1 n q m c m j j 1 k where qt is the mixed groundwater qm is the recharge from component m and c m j is the tracer j incorporated into the component m we used this technique with four underlying assumption 1 groundwater is a mixture of source substances with a fixed composition 2 the mixing process is linear and completely dependent on hydrodynamic mixing 3 the substances used as tracers are conservative and 4 the source substances have extreme concentrations 4 results 4 1 stable isotope compositions of waters the stable isotope compositions of precipitation in the ejina oasis varied widely with the values ranging from 10 02 to 8 04 for δ 18o and 63 21 to 13 79 for δd the arithmetic mean values of δ 18o and δd is 3 65 and 29 83 respectively the d excess values changed from 50 50 to 16 98 with an average of 0 66 a synthesis of precipitation stable isotope values from our samples and the published literature zhao et al 2011 gnip was used to establish the local meteoric water line lmwl for exploring the interaction relationship between precipitation and groundwater in the ejina oasis fig 3 the lmwl is determined as δd 7 34δ 18o 8 31 r2 0 98 n 146 and the summer local meteoric water line slmwl based on the ten precipitation samples from our field works is expressed as δd 4 28δ 18o 14 21 r2 0 84 n 10 fig 3 compared with the global meteoric water line δd 8 17δ 18o 10 35 r2 0 98 n 206 rozanski et al 1993 the slopes and intercepts of lmwl and slmwl were significantly lower the deviation of lmwl from the gmwl can be attributed to the convective recycling effects that drive summer rains and the considerable secondary evaporation of rainfall that occurs in the region the δ 18o and δd values of groundwater samples from the mhr varied from 9 14 to 6 35 and from 60 29 to 41 39 respectively with the mean value of 7 47 and 48 95 river water from the middle and lower reaches of the heihe river displayed a narrow range of isotopic values for both δ 18o 7 80 to 6 20 and δd 49 60 to 34 51 and the mean value of 7 and 41 69 respectively the d excess of river water varied from 8 10 to 18 00 the δ 18o and δd of groundwater in the different aquifers in the ejina oasis exhibited was significant fluctuations with the δ 18o ranging from 7 05 to 5 11 and the δd ranging from 51 73 to 37 44 table 1 the shallow groundwater enriched in the heaviest isotope with the mean values of 6 53 and 44 55 for δ 18o and δd respectively the semi confined groundwater exhibited more depleted isotopes than the shallow groundwater but they were not as depleted as the groundwater from the confined aquifer with a mean δ 18o value of 7 79 and a mean δd value of 52 98 table 1 the confined groundwater showed the most negative isotopic composition with the δ 18o values varying from 10 56 to 10 95 and δd varying from 89 43 to 90 67 average value 10 74 and 89 94 table 1 the d excess values of groundwater samples from the three aquifers in the oasis were remarkable discrepancy and the average d excess values of the shallow groundwater semi confined groundwater and confined groundwater were 7 71 9 33 and 4 05 respectively in fig 4 the shallow groundwater samples were plotted underneath of the lmwl and located in the upper right corner as well as marked with the yellow oval the semi confined groundwater samples distributed in the middle part while the confined groundwater samples were clustered in the bottom left corner they were marked with shallow blue and gray ovals respectively fig 4 additionally the d excess values could be used to group the groundwater sample by aquifer zhao et al 2012 guo et al 2019 the shallow groundwater samples all gathered in the upper right the semi confined groundwater samples were closely connected with it and located in the upper left and the confined groundwater samples were assembled in the left bottom fig 5 the differences in stable isotopic compositions of the three kinds of groundwater coupled with the spatial distributions figs 4 and 5 indicated that groundwater from groundwater of shallow semi confined and confined aquifers was probably fed by different water sources 4 2 the electric conductivity ec and cl concentrations of waters the river water exhibited the lowest ec concentrations the ec concentrations ranging from 0 20 ms cm to 0 81 ms cm with an average value of 0 57 ms cm table 1 the ec concentrations of groundwater samples from the mhr varied from 0 63 ms cm to 6 19 ms cm and the average was 2 61 ms cm groundwater in the ejina oasis had significantly higher ec values than river water table 1 specifically the shallow groundwater had the highest ec values varying from 1 10 ms cm to 22 30 ms cm the ec concentration of the semi confined groundwater changed from 1 92 ms cm to 22 80 ms cm mean 5 84 ms cm the confined groundwater exhibited lowest ec values among the three aquifers in the ejina oasis which ranged from 2 06 ms cm to 3 96 ms cm mean 3 08 ms cm cl concentrations of river water ranged from 0 08 meq l to 2 74 meq l mean 0 81 meq l the cl concentrations of the groundwater in the mhr varied from 0 70 meq l to 23 71 meq l with a mean value of 8 64 meq l it showed a very wide range of the cl concentrations for the groundwater in the ejina oasis table 1 it displayed a decreasing trend from shallow aquifer to semi confined aquifer and to confined aquifer with the mean values of 10 99 meq l 9 33 meq l and 8 48 meq l respectively 5 discussion 5 1 the recharge sources of different aquifers 5 1 1 origin of groundwater in confined aquifer given the much depleted isotope values and the low ec and cl concentrations of the confined groundwater samples it is unlikely that recharge from the shallow and the semi confined aquifer to the confined aquifer occurred additionally groundwater pressure of the confined aquifer was higher than other two upper aquifers ruan et al 2015 the confined groundwater samples had relatively homogeneous stable isotope compositions and were significantly more depleted than the weighted average value of modern precipitation δp 7 07 for δ 18o and 43 61 for δd which has been calculated by precipitation stable isotope values from our samples and the published data zhao et al 2011 gnip fig 3 and the d excess values were all negative table 1 and fig 5 these results suggested that the confined groundwater was not probably a mixture of multiple water sources and the preferential recharge of confined aquifer in the ejina oasis could take place during cooler climatic conditions these climatic conditions likely existed in the cold periods of the late pleistocene and holocene or the high mountains dassi 2011 while the qilian mountains could be a potential source of recharge for this region but the confined aquifers exhibited more depleted isotopes than that of groundwater in the qilian mountains the mean δ 18o 8 20 zhao et al 2018 it demonstrated that the lateral groundwater flow from the qilian mountain was impossible to recharge the confined aquifer of the ejina oasis thus it was considering comprehensively that the confined groundwater aquifer likely contained old water that originated during paleo climatic humid and cold conditions which prevailed during the late pleistocene and the early holocene su et al 2007 confined aquifer groundwater from surrounding oases e g minqin oasis jinchang oasis east junggar basin have similar δ 18o δd and d excess values which have been attributed to formation of the aquifer in the late pleistocene and holocene edmunds et al 2006 ma et al 2010 li et al 2015 5 1 2 origin of groundwater in shallow aquifer the enriched δ 18o and δd values in the shallow groundwater in the ejina oasis were similar to those of river water in the middle and lower heihe river indicating a close hydrological connection between river water and shallow groundwater the flat terrain in the oasis and high permeability of the aquifer material allowed for river water infiltration into the groundwater aquifers when it was discharged slowly from the reservoir in the mhr xi et al 2015 the local evaporation line of shallow groundwater lel1 is δd 4 75δ 18o 13 37 r2 0 66 fig 6 the slope is only 4 75 which had a lower intercept than the lmwl due to the evaporation of river water recharging the aquifer in addition the ec and cl concentrations were highest in the shallow groundwater likely influenced by evaporation as river water infiltrated under the local extreme arid environment consequently we can conclude that river water infiltration was an important recharge source of the shallow groundwater in the oasis precipitation also seems to be a non negligible recharge source for the shallow groundwater although the climate is extremely arid in the ejina oasis and majority of precipitation events are concentrated in the summer and autumn months some heavy rain events can lead to the floods xi et al 2010 importantly the ejina oasis is located in the terminal basin of heihe river and floodwaters from the surrounding mountains flow into the oasis and disappear via infiltration into the highly permeable shallow aquifer or evaporate finally additionally the equation of the slmwl is δd 4 28δ 18o 14 21 which is similar to the lel1 fig 6 indicating the local summer precipitation played a vital role in the shallow groundwater recharge so it is appropriate to consider precipitation as one of the prominent groundwater recharge sources furthermore the shallow groundwater samples were distributed along the lmwl and the shallow groundwater enriched in the heaviest isotope and all concentrated in the upper right compared with the semi confined groundwater and confined groundwater figs 4 and 5 they were quite different from the old groundwater of the confined aquifer indicating it was modern water therefore the shallow groundwater was identified as modern water and it was fed by the local precipitation and river water infiltration recharge 5 1 3 origin of groundwater in semi confined aquifer stable isotope compositions of most semi confined groundwater samples were higher than the confined groundwater but were lower than the shallow groundwater fig 4 the isotopic discrepancy of groundwater of different aquifers is primarily controlled by main recharge sources carucci et al 2012 thus we can conclude that the main recharge water of the semi confined groundwater was distinguished from the shallow and confined groundwater the semi confined groundwater samples were assembled beneath the lmwl like the shallow groundwater fig 4 and the two kinds groundwater samples were distributed along the lmwl in spite of the shallow groundwater samples gathered in the right upper corner fig 4 implying that a closely hydrologic link was existed between shallow and semi confined aquifers moreover the distribution of semi confined groundwater samples was closely connected with the shallow groundwater in fig 5 the local high permeability shallow aquifer in the ejina oasis supports vertical migration of groundwater from the shallow aquifer to the semi confined aquifer xi et al 2010 the local evaporation line of semi confined groundwater lel2 is δd 8 50δ 18o 13 26 r2 0 87 the slope is significantly higher than that of lel1 and lmwl fig 6 suggesting the semi confined groundwater has experienced less evaporation than the shallow groundwater the δ 18o and δd values of the semi confined groundwater were similar to the groundwater of the mhr indicating there was a close hydrological connection between them the deep groundwater aquifer of the mhr at 1250 m elevation is less than 60 m deep while the semi confined groundwater in the ejina oasis at 900 m elevation is less than 30 m deep and this hydraulic gradient can promote lateral flow of groundwater from the mhr towards the ejina oasis xi et al 2015 given the similar isotopic characteristics of groundwater in the mhr and the oasis it is reasonable to consider that groundwater from the mhr is a vital recharge source for groundwater in the semi confined aquifer in the ejina oasis the intersection between lel and lmwl indicated a stable isotope composition for the initial groundwater recharge source δi that is a weighted mean of initial precipitation as an effective recharge source dogramaci et al 2012 the calculated δi of the semi confined groundwater was 8 37 for δ 18o and 53 13 for δd which was more negative than the mean δ 18o value of shallow groundwater 6 53 the lateral groundwater flow from mhr 7 47 and the semi confined groundwater 7 79 thus besides the shallow groundwater and the lateral groundwater from mhr some other water source with a more depleted isotopic composition contributed to recharging the semi confined aquifer we considered the confined groundwater as a third potential recharge source for the semi confined aquifer as this water source had the most depleted isotope values there were distributed numerous faults between the semi confined aquifer and the confined aquifer fig 2 which could promote upward flow of the confined groundwater to replenish the semi confined groundwater consequently the shallow groundwater the lateral groundwater flow and the confined groundwater were three potential recharge sources for the semi confined groundwater in the ejina oasis 5 2 quantitative evaluation of recharge source contributions clearly identifying groundwater recharge sources and their corresponding contributions is prerequisite to sustainable management of aquifers to ensure that the needs of humans and ecosystem are met yang et al 2019 the emma was widely used to evaluate the contribution ratio of each recharge source of groundwater guo et al 2015 the oxygen isotope compositions of waters have the potential for use in tracing both sources and flow paths in groundwater systems liu and yamanaka 2012 meanwhile cl is a very conservative tracer and is useful as a groundwater tracer to evaluate groundwater recharge in alluvial sediments huang et al 2017 δ 18o δd and cl values for precipitation river water and groundwater from different aquifers were used to evaluate the contribution ratio of each recharge source to the different groundwater pools in the ejina oasis plots of mean δd vs δ 18o and cl vs δ 18o for groundwater and potential end members show that shallow groundwater was close to the mixing line of precipitation and river water which are two likely end members fig 7 a based on the two component hydrograph separation model calculation we found that about 87 of shallow groundwater was derived from the river water and 13 from the local precipitation in fig 7b the semi confined groundwater was located within the triangle formed by the three potential end members the shallow groundwater the lateral groundwater from the mhr and the confined groundwater based on the three component hydrograph separation model analysis the shallow groundwater the lateral groundwater from mhr and the confined groundwater accounted for 30 52 and 18 of the semi confined groundwater respectively the possible error of the estimated contribution ratio was computed by considering the uncertain composition of end members and groundwater guo et al 2015 a gaussian error estimators based uncertainty propagation technique genereux 1998 was used in this study to estimate uncertainties in tracer based hydrograph separation standard deviation of values δ18o and cl concentration of groundwater and corresponding end members were used to estimate the uncertainty with 70 confidence possible errors of the end members ranged from 3 to 10 table 2 which suggested that the results of the hydrograph separation were considerably reliable within a 10 error range 5 3 conceptual model of groundwater recharge for the different aquifers the hydrogeological data the isotopic and geochemical signatures of groundwater and the recharge sources of groundwater and their contribution ratios were all used to develop a conceptual model for groundwater recharge sources in the ejina oasis fig 8 the aquifers of the ejina oasis can be divided into the shallow aquifer semi confined aquifer and confined aquifer the shallow groundwater was modern water mainly controlled by precipitation and river water and easily influenced by evaporation the semi confined aquifer located between the shallow aquifer and the confined aquifer was influence by the close hydrological connections between with the other two aquifers the relatively low ec and cl concentrations of groundwater in this aquifer suggested slight influence of water rock interaction or recharge by water which has experienced less evaporation the semi confined groundwater is mixture of different water sources with gravity driven vertical infiltration from shallow groundwater due to favorable lithological conditions lateral groundwater from the mhr flow providing more than half of the recharge and upwards seepage from the confined aquifer among these three sources water the lateral groundwater flow from the mhr was a primary source because of the hydraulic gradient and the local good hydrogeological conditions promoting lateral water movement figs 1b and 2 the confined groundwater presented remarkable differences compared the two upper aquifers with the depleted isotopes and low geochemical concentrations ec and cl suggesting weak hydrological connections with the upper two aquifers the confined groundwater likely formed in the paleo climatic humid and cold conditions and flow direction within the aquifer is unclear 5 4 insight for integrated water resources management the shallow and semi confined aquifers experienced different variations in groundwater levels during 1990 2010 with contrasting trends occurring after the ewdp fig 9 a and b the groundwater levels of wells a and b in the shallow aquifer varied from 2 59 m in 1990 to 2 68 m in 2000 and from 1 99 m in 1990 to 2 18 m in 2000 respectively meanwhile the groundwater levels of wells c and d in the semi confined aquifer decreased from 4 02 m in 1990 to 5 54 m in 2000 and from 1 54 m in 1990 to 1 87 m in 2000 respectively the declining groundwater levels in the two aquifers during this period triggered a series of ecological problems at the ejina oasis including the disappearance of the terminal lakes loss of vegetation cover atrophy of natural oases desertification and frequent sandstorm si et al 2015 as part of the ewdp to improve the ecosystem more than 57 82 of the upstream heihe river water was diverted to the ejina oasis zhang et al 2018 in the 2 3 years following the implementation of ewdp the shallow groundwater levels began to rise gradually fig 9a and b the groundwater levels in wells a and b rose to 2 34 m and 1 8 m in 2009 which were higher than the groundwater levels had been in 1990 shallow groundwater levels continued to recover gradually and can now meet the water requirements of the local groundwater dependent ecosystems zhang et al 2017 but there has been a gap between the reality and the expectations in terms of vegetation recovery zhou et al 2018 although the declining trends of the semi confined groundwater levels slowed during three years after the implementation of the ewdp the groundwater levels have continued to decrease in well c and d the highest groundwater levels were appeared in 1990 with 4 02 m and 1 54 m respectively and the lowest levels were measured in 2009 with 6 54 m and 2 06 m before the ewdp the groundwater levels of the two wells have declined 1 52 m and 0 33 m after 2000 the groundwater levels of the two wells have decreased 1 m and 0 13 m fig 9c and d the implementation of ewdp did not change the trajectory of decreasing semi confined groundwater levels yu et al 2018 the evidently different responses of the shallow and semi confined aquifers to the ewdp implementation were attributed to the diversities of recharge sources river water infiltration was the main source of recharge 87 to the shallow aquifer in the ejina oasis once increased surface runoff flowed into the ejina oasis the groundwater level of shallow aquifer was raised in a relatively short time however the semi confined groundwater is a mixture of shallow groundwater 30 lateral groundwater flowing from mhr 52 and confined groundwater 18 it demonstrated that there was a remarkable hydrological connection between the middle and the lower reaches aquifers and emphasized the critical role of groundwater interactions of different aquifers in the ejina oasis after the ewdp began the average runoff of the lanxin mountains station has increased to 5 29 108 m3 during 2000 2010 with an increase of 1 52 108 m3 compared to the level between 1990 and 2000 zhang et al 2018 this resulted in the gradual raise of shallow groundwater level in the ejina oasis but the correlation between the runoff from the middle reaches and groundwater levels in the oasis is not significant due to influence of ecology and hydrogeology yao et al 2015 the area of ejina oasis has increased to 533 04 km2 in 2000 from 704 95 km2 in 2010 in which croplands was the largest contributor li et al 2018 meanwhile the croplands became a main consumer of freshwater resources than the terminal lakes in the oasis zhang et al 2018 the ewdp was designed to allocate more water for environmental use not for supporting agriculture development si et al 2015 thus the expansion of cropland was an unsuitable use of water resources and it has retarded groundwater level and ecosystem restoration in the ejina oasis the decline of the groundwater in the semi confined aquifer was mainly attributed to a reduction in groundwater flow from the mhr as farmers in the oases of the mhr continued to over exploit groundwater for irrigation even after the application of ewdp li et al 2018 the middle reaches has experienced a continuous expansion of cropland of which the total irrigation water volume had increased from 18 71 108 m3 a in 1990 1999 to 19 28 108 m3 a in 2000 2010 with most of the newly reclaimed farmland was only dependent on groundwater irrigation in the middle reaches after 2000 cheng et al 2014 it was reported that groundwater irrigation has increased from 4 04 108 to 6 15 108 m3 a whereas canal irrigation has decreased from 14 67 108 to 13 13 108 m3 a the irrigation activities have caused as much as 1 86 m decline of groundwater level in mhr during the past three decades what may be worrisome in the future with a further 3 06 0 4 m decline till 2050 liu et al 2018 niu et al 2019 evidently the ewdp implementation has indirectly led to an imbalance in the groundwater resource between the midstream and downstream reaches with resulting local vegetation degradation in the middle reaches and there has been an expansion of crop land in the downstream oasis accordingly we should be based on integrated water management of river water and groundwater diversion across the whole basin to promote the recovery of groundwater level of different aquifers it is also necessary to scientifically control the areas of the midstream farmlands and desert oasis at downstream to restrict non ecological water use and to reduce non beneficial evapotranspiration in the ejina oasis for optimizing the water allocation ratio in the basin scale 6 conclusions this research is a systematic attempt to identify recharge sources of shallow semi confined and confined aquifers in the ejina oasis using water isotopes δ 18o and δd and geochemistry ec and cl shallow groundwater is modern water which originates from 13 of local precipitation and 87 of river water infiltration recharge while the confined groundwater likely formed in the paleo climatic humid and cold conditions that prevailed during the late pleistocene and the early holocene is old water and non renewable the semi confined groundwater is mixed water which deriving from 30 of the shallow groundwater 52 of the lateral groundwater from the mhr and 18 of confined groundwater after implementation of the ewdp shallow groundwater levels increased due to diversions of the heihe river into the ejina oasis and river water infiltration however the semi confined groundwater levels continued to decline due to decreased recharge from the mhr where groundwater was over exploited for irrigation all this information can be included in integrated water management efforts that account for river water and groundwater diversion across the watershed

6063,the global expansion of irrigation based agricultural practices is causing an overexploitation of groundwater resources a thorough understanding of groundwater recharge processes is necessary for restoring groundwater and improving water resources management especially in desert oasis aquifers in endorheic basins in this paper the ejina oasis in the downstream of heihe river basin was selected as the representative case for such an endeavor based on stable isotopes and end member mixing analysis we found that the shallow groundwater was modern water with 13 originating from local precipitation and 87 from river water infiltration the semi confined groundwater is a mixture of shallow groundwater 30 lateral groundwater flowing from the middle heihe river basin mhr 52 and confined groundwater 18 confined groundwater was old water formed in paleo climatic humid and cold conditions shallow groundwater levels were restored substantially after implementation of the ecological water diversion project ewdp began in 2000 in the heihe river basin but the semi confined groundwater levels still declined slowly these different responses to ewdp are attributed to the differences in primary recharge sources of the two aquifers because river water infiltration was the main sources of shallow groundwater increases in river discharge into the ejina oasis resulted in increased shallow groundwater levels over a short time scale continued over pumping of groundwater for irrigation in the mhr reduced lateral groundwater flow into the lower heihe river basin which was the primary source of semi confined groundwater for successful groundwater restoration and maintenance of groundwater for the future ewdp implementation must integrate water management of river water and groundwater diversion across the whole basin our results can provide useful information on policy decision makers for sustainable use of water resources in the oases of other similar watersheds

2016 the successful implementation of water resource projects requires a clear understanding of site specific hydrological processes such as groundwater recharge which until now have been neglected

been diverted to the oases of the middle reaches between 1960 and 1990 primarily due to expansion of the irrigated agriculture xi et al 2015 xu et al 2019 has resulted in decreased river discharge lowered groundwater levels dried out lakes and the degradation of important ecosystems in the ejina oasis at the downstream of the basin this situation not only dramatically increased the number of sandstorms in local region but also induced greater numbers of sandstorms in northern china feng et al 2013 to address these issues the ecological water diversion project ewdp in the heihe river basin was implemented in 2000 to increase the amount of water diverted to the ejina oasis to prevent further deterioration of the environment and restore the ecological and hydrological functions of the oasis cheng et al 2014 the natural desert riparian woods and the nature desert ecosystem are dependent on the groundwater sources which are the primary available water resource in the ejina oasis feng

resource management shallow groundwater levels in the ejina oasis aquifer have gradually recovered but groundwater levels in the semi confined aquifer continues to decrease since the 1990s even though

ecological balance in the ejina oasis has attracted the attention of eco hydrological researchers for a long period of time but the focus on this specific region has increased more recently previous studies on the groundwater in the oasis can be summarized into the following three aspects first to explore the relationship between the groundwater levels variations and the vegetation changes zhu et al 2009 wang et al 2014a si et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 zhou et al 2018 second to focus on assessment interactions of surface water and shallow groundwater yao et al 2015 xi et al 2015 2018 third to qualitatively describe the hydrogeological and geochemical characteristics of groundwater su et al 2007 wen et al 2008 wang et al 2014b zhao et al 2018 although the existing researches on the ejina oasis have provided useful insights into the restoration of shallow groundwater levels a quantitative estimation of the sources of groundwater recharge to both the shallow and semi confined aquifers is still necessary especially as the semi confined groundwater resources have become a more prominent sources of freshwater in the ejina oasis xi et al 2018 lacking definitive information about groundwater recharge sources government decision makers have not appropriately managed the health of these aquifers xi et al 2010 shen et al 2017 yu et al 2018 if this situation continues it is likely that the groundwater degradation in the semi confined aquifer will become an intractable problem for the ejina oasis the significant differences in isotopic compositions among precipitation surface

isotopes 18o and d of water have been widely used as environmental indicator in the field of groundwater origin and recharge prada et al 2016 jasechko et al 2017 the end member mixing analysis emma approach can be exploited to identify and quantify water sources contributing to the recharge of various aquifers based on the mass balance of tracers peng et al 2016 and these results will provide significant insights for creating sustainable water resources management plans guo et al 2019 in this paper a comprehensive analysis on the stable isotopic and geochemical methods as well as end member mixing analysis was conducted we aim to expand the body of knowledge about sources of groundwater recharge in the ejina oasis by 1 investigating the isotopic and geochemical signatures of shallow semi confined confined aquifers 2 quantifying the recharge sources of different aquifers and 3 exploring the responses of the shallow and semi confined aquifers to the ewdp implementation to inform integrated water resources management efforts our results will provide fundamental information on groundwater recharge sources in multiple aquifers system in the ejina oasis which can be used to optimize the strategies of ewdp on conjunctive management of surface water and groundwater and to explore a balance between recharge and abstraction of groundwater in heihe river basin with a much broader implications for other parts of the world with similar watersheds 2 study area 2 1 general setting the heihe river basin is the second largest endorheic basin in the arid region of northwestern china the river originates in the qilian mountains and then flows northward through the zhangye jiuquan jinta and dingxin oasis in the middle reaches and the ejina oasis in the lower reaches fig 1a and b in the ejina oasis the heihe river forks into eastern and western branches from the langxin mountains and then disappears in the east juyan lake and west juyan lake dried respectively fig 1a the main riverbeds are shallow and wide with sand and coarse sand substrate which promotes river water infiltration into the groundwater system wen et al 2008 groundwater is the major available water resource in the oasis the natural desert riparian woods and the nature desert ecosystem are dependent on the groundwater sources feng et al 2013 the level of groundwater is the key factor for keeping the stability of eco environment at the oasis shen et al 2017 the ejina oasis geographically consists of a series of middle and low denudation mountains and proluvial fan delta covering approximately 3 104 km2 the elevation declines from the langxin mountain 1200 m a s l in the southwest part of the oasis to the east juyan lake 850 m a s l in the northeast the oasis is surrounded by the gobi desert and the badain jaran desert fig 1b the ejina oasis is considered as an important ecological barrier against sandstorms due to the desert around the oasis is the main sources areas of sand storm in china the study area is dominated by an arid continental climate with broad variations in temperature and precipitation the mean annual temperature is 9 c with monthly average temperature ranges from 36 c to 42 c the mean annual precipitation is 33 mm but can be as high as 100 mm in the wettest years and only 7 mm in driest years the mean annual pan evaporation is about 3200 mm more than 70 of the annual precipitation falls between june and september and some precipitation events can cause floods and produce temporary streams 2 2 geological and hydrogeological setting the ejina oasis is a regional sag geotectonic basin the eastern margin is bounded by the hidden badain jaran desert fault the southern edge is linked with the fault of alashan uplift and the northern and western boundaries lie along the bedrock of adjacent mountains glacial and interglacial stages frequently alternated in the quaternary which led to intensive denudation and erosion in the qilian mountains the majority of the eroded materials were transported to the basin by the heihe river and the floods resulted in the formation of alluvial proluvial fans delta in the basin the impermeable basement rocks of the basin consist of sinian z and late jurassic j3 formations and the main aquifers overlying the basement rock are comprised of unconsolidated quaternary q sediments with pebbles sandstone medium fine sandstone sandy mudstone and mudstone fig 2 due to the effect of tectonic movement the sediments thickness has been increasing from the marginal to the central of the basin and the grain size of sediment has been decreasing from coarse sands in the southwest to fine sands in the northeast fig 2 however the coarse sediments were alternated with the fine materials in the vertical layers frequently owing to the runoff variations of the heihe river during the glacial and interglacial periods the quaternary sediments comprise the main aquifers in the ejina oasis due to their unconsolidated and high permeable nature fig 2 these are the most productive units and constitute the base of the groundwater reservoir based on the impact of geologic structures in the horizontal directions groundwater levels decline gradually from southern to northern as a result groundwater changes from shallow groundwater to semi confined and confined groundwater the groundwater in the ejina oasis flows from the southwest to the northeast with the hydraulic gradient ranging from 0 6 to over 1 qin et al 2012 in the vertical the aquifers vary from the single shallow aquifer in the southwest to the multiple aquifers of semi confined and confined groundwater in the northeast the shallow aquifers in the basin are no more than 30 m in depth and were distributed in the upper of discontinuous aquicludes the confined aquifer is more than 100 m underground with the continuous aquicludes covering on it resulting in very slow recharge rates the semi confined aquifer found between the shallow aquifer and confined aquifer and ranges between 30 m and 100 m underground fig 2 even though the hydraulic characteristics of the three aquifers are significantly different they exhibited close relationships in recharge origin and reserve conditions xi et al 2010 wang et al 2013 3 material and methods 3 1 sampling and analysis river water and groundwater samples were taken during august 2015 and july 2016 to document spatial variation in the isotopic and geochemical signatures in the middle reaches of the heihe river mhr and of the different aquifers in the ejina oasis we obtained 10 groundwater from deep wells with depths range from 60 to 120 m and 21 river water samples from the mhr and 76 groundwater samples from the ejina oasis including shallow n 33 well depths less than 30 m semi confined groundwater samples n 38 well depths range from 30 to 100 m and confined n 5 a sample from well with the depth over 100 m and four samples from artesian wells groundwater samples we also collected 10 precipitation samples from june to september in 2015 and 2016 at the ejina oasis and rainfall in the four months accounted for 89 and 83 of the annual precipitation respectively sample bottles were completely filled with water without headspace and sealed with a parafilm tape all samples were stored in hdpe bottles at 4 c until laboratory analyses the sampling sites were marked in the fig 1c in addition the 20 year data between 1990 and 2009 from four monitoring wells well a well b well c and well d was used to investigate the groundwater levels variations before and after the ewdp implementation the depth of well a well b well c and well d is 16 m 22 m 85 m and 70 m respectively the well a and well b are shallow groundwater and the semi confined groundwater was identified for well c and well d fig 2 the stable oxygen and hydrogen isotopic values of water samples were analyzed using gv isoprime continuous flow mass spectrometer cf irms at the key laboratory of ecohydrology of inland river basin chinese academy of sciences the oxygen stable isotope ratio values of the samples were measured using co2 h2o equilibration the hydrogen stable isotope ratio values were measured using cf irms the water sample equilibrated in a vial with h2 gas using platinum wire as the catalyst the results were expressed in concentrations per mil relative to the vienna standard mean ocean water v smow and symbolized as δ 18o and δd the systematic analytical errors for the δd and δ 18o values were 0 02 and 0 05 respectively electrical conductivity ec and ph were measured using hq40d portable electronic equipment hach usa the cl concentrations were measured with an analytical error of 0 2 by means of ion chromatography using an ics 2500 ion chromatograph dionex sunnyvale ca in the same laboratory 3 2 end member mixing analysis end member mixing analysis emma which is based on the mass balance of tracers was used to determine the potential sources contributing to river and groundwater samples and to evaluate the contribution of each source to groundwater recharge the method is described as the following equation 1 q t m 1 n q m q t c t j m 1 n q m c m j j 1 k where qt is the mixed groundwater qm is the recharge from component m and c m j is the tracer j incorporated into the component m we used this technique with four underlying assumption 1 groundwater is a mixture of source substances with a fixed composition 2 the mixing process is linear and completely dependent on hydrodynamic mixing 3 the substances used as tracers are conservative and 4 the source substances have extreme concentrations 4 results 4 1 stable isotope compositions of waters the stable isotope compositions of precipitation in the ejina oasis varied widely with the values ranging from 10 02 to 8 04 for δ 18o and 63 21 to 13 79 for δd the arithmetic mean values of δ 18o and δd is 3 65 and 29 83 respectively the d excess values changed from 50 50 to 16 98 with an average of 0 66 a synthesis of precipitation stable isotope values from our samples and the published literature zhao et al 2011 gnip was used to establish the local meteoric water line lmwl for exploring the interaction relationship between precipitation and groundwater in the ejina oasis fig 3 the lmwl is determined as δd 7 34δ 18o 8 31 r2 0 98 n 146 and the summer local meteoric water line slmwl based on the ten precipitation samples from our field works is expressed as δd 4 28δ 18o 14 21 r2 0 84 n 10 fig 3 compared with the global meteoric water line δd 8 17δ 18o 10 35 r2 0 98 n 206 rozanski et al 1993 the slopes and intercepts of lmwl and slmwl were significantly lower the deviation of lmwl from the gmwl can be attributed to the convective recycling effects that drive summer rains and the considerable secondary evaporation of rainfall that occurs in the region the δ 18o and δd values of groundwater samples from the mhr varied from 9 14 to 6 35 and from 60 29 to 41 39 respectively with the mean value of 7 47 and 48 95 river water from the middle and lower reaches of the heihe river displayed a narrow range of isotopic values for both δ 18o 7 80 to 6 20 and δd 49 60 to 34 51 and the mean value of 7 and 41 69 respectively the d excess of river water varied from 8 10 to 18 00 the δ 18o and δd of groundwater in the different aquifers in the ejina oasis exhibited was significant fluctuations with the δ 18o ranging from 7 05 to 5 11 and the δd ranging from 51 73 to 37 44 table 1 the shallow groundwater enriched in the heaviest isotope with the mean values of 6 53 and 44 55 for δ 18o and δd respectively the semi confined groundwater exhibited more depleted isotopes than the shallow groundwater but they were not as depleted as the groundwater from the confined aquifer with a mean δ 18o value of 7 79 and a mean δd value of 52 98 table 1 the confined groundwater showed the most negative isotopic composition with the δ 18o values varying from 10 56 to 10 95 and δd varying from 89 43 to 90 67 average value 10 74 and 89 94 table 1 the d excess values of groundwater samples from the three aquifers in the oasis were remarkable discrepancy and the average d excess values of the shallow groundwater semi confined groundwater and confined groundwater were 7 71 9 33 and 4 05 respectively in fig 4 the shallow groundwater samples were plotted underneath of the lmwl and located in the upper right corner as well as marked with the yellow oval the semi confined groundwater samples distributed in the middle part while the confined groundwater samples were clustered in the bottom left corner they were marked with shallow blue and gray ovals respectively fig 4 additionally the d excess values could be used to group the groundwater sample by aquifer zhao et al 2012 guo et al 2019 the shallow groundwater samples all gathered in the upper right the semi confined groundwater samples were closely connected with it and located in the upper left and the confined groundwater samples were assembled in the left bottom fig 5 the differences in stable isotopic compositions of the three kinds of groundwater coupled with the spatial distributions figs 4 and 5 indicated that groundwater from groundwater of shallow semi confined and confined aquifers was probably fed by different water sources 4 2 the electric conductivity ec and cl concentrations of waters the river water exhibited the lowest ec concentrations the ec concentrations ranging from 0 20 ms cm to 0 81 ms cm with an average value of 0 57 ms cm table 1 the ec concentrations of groundwater samples from the mhr varied from 0 63 ms cm to 6 19 ms cm and the average was 2 61 ms cm groundwater in the ejina oasis had significantly higher ec values than river water table 1 specifically the shallow groundwater had the highest ec values varying from 1 10 ms cm to 22 30 ms cm the ec concentration of the semi confined groundwater changed from 1 92 ms cm to 22 80 ms cm mean 5 84 ms cm the confined groundwater exhibited lowest ec values among the three aquifers in the ejina oasis which ranged from 2 06 ms cm to 3 96 ms cm mean 3 08 ms cm cl concentrations of river water ranged from 0 08 meq l to 2 74 meq l mean 0 81 meq l the cl concentrations of the groundwater in the mhr varied from 0 70 meq l to 23 71 meq l with a mean value of 8 64 meq l it showed a very wide range of the cl concentrations for the groundwater in the ejina oasis table 1 it displayed a decreasing trend from shallow aquifer to semi confined aquifer and to confined aquifer with the mean values of 10 99 meq l 9 33 meq l and 8 48 meq l respectively 5 discussion 5 1 the recharge sources of different aquifers 5 1 1 origin of groundwater in confined aquifer given the much depleted isotope values and the low ec and cl concentrations of the confined groundwater samples it is unlikely that recharge from the shallow and the semi confined aquifer to the confined aquifer occurred additionally groundwater pressure of the confined aquifer was higher than other two upper aquifers ruan et al 2015 the confined groundwater samples had relatively homogeneous stable isotope compositions and were significantly more depleted than the weighted average value of modern precipitation δp 7 07 for δ 18o and 43 61 for δd which has been calculated by precipitation stable isotope values from our samples and the published data zhao et al 2011 gnip fig 3 and the d excess values were all negative table 1 and fig 5 these results suggested that the confined groundwater was not probably a mixture of multiple water sources and the preferential recharge of confined aquifer in the ejina oasis could take place during cooler climatic conditions these climatic conditions likely existed in the cold periods of the late pleistocene and holocene or the high mountains dassi 2011 while the qilian mountains could be a potential source of recharge for this region but the confined aquifers exhibited more depleted isotopes than that of groundwater in the qilian mountains the mean δ 18o 8 20 zhao et al 2018 it demonstrated that the lateral groundwater flow from the qilian mountain was impossible to recharge the confined aquifer of the ejina oasis thus it was considering comprehensively that the confined groundwater aquifer likely contained old water that originated during paleo climatic humid and cold conditions which prevailed during the late pleistocene and the early holocene su et al 2007 confined aquifer groundwater from surrounding oases e g minqin oasis jinchang oasis east junggar basin have similar δ 18o δd and d excess values which have been attributed to formation of the aquifer in the late pleistocene and holocene edmunds et al 2006 ma et al 2010 li et al 2015 5 1 2 origin of groundwater in shallow aquifer the enriched δ 18o and δd values in the shallow groundwater in the ejina oasis were similar to those of river water in the middle and lower heihe river indicating a close hydrological connection between river water and shallow groundwater the flat terrain in the oasis and high permeability of the aquifer material allowed for river water infiltration into the groundwater aquifers when it was discharged slowly from the reservoir in the mhr xi et al 2015 the local evaporation line of shallow groundwater lel1 is δd 4 75δ 18o 13 37 r2 0 66 fig 6 the slope is only 4 75 which had a lower intercept than the lmwl due to the evaporation of river water recharging the aquifer in addition the ec and cl concentrations were highest in the shallow groundwater likely influenced by evaporation as river water infiltrated under the local extreme arid environment consequently we can conclude that river water infiltration was an important recharge source of the shallow groundwater in the oasis precipitation also seems to be a non negligible recharge source for the shallow groundwater although the climate is extremely arid in the ejina oasis and majority of precipitation events are concentrated in the summer and autumn months some heavy rain events can lead to the floods xi et al 2010 importantly the ejina oasis is located in the terminal basin of heihe river and floodwaters from the surrounding mountains flow into the oasis and disappear via infiltration into the highly permeable shallow aquifer or evaporate finally additionally the equation of the slmwl is δd 4 28δ 18o 14 21 which is similar to the lel1 fig 6 indicating the local summer precipitation played a vital role in the shallow groundwater recharge so it is appropriate to consider precipitation as one of the prominent groundwater recharge sources furthermore the shallow groundwater samples were distributed along the lmwl and the shallow groundwater enriched in the heaviest isotope and all concentrated in the upper right compared with the semi confined groundwater and confined groundwater figs 4 and 5 they were quite different from the old groundwater of the confined aquifer indicating it was modern water therefore the shallow groundwater was identified as modern water and it was fed by the local precipitation and river water infiltration recharge 5 1 3 origin of groundwater in semi confined aquifer stable isotope compositions of most semi confined groundwater samples were higher than the confined groundwater but were lower than the shallow groundwater fig 4 the isotopic discrepancy of groundwater of different aquifers is primarily controlled by main recharge sources carucci et al 2012 thus we can conclude that the main recharge water of the semi confined groundwater was distinguished from the shallow and confined groundwater the semi confined groundwater samples were assembled beneath the lmwl like the shallow groundwater fig 4 and the two kinds groundwater samples were distributed along the lmwl in spite of the shallow groundwater samples gathered in the right upper corner fig 4 implying that a closely hydrologic link was existed between shallow and semi confined aquifers moreover the distribution of semi confined groundwater samples was closely connected with the shallow groundwater in fig 5 the local high permeability shallow aquifer in the ejina oasis supports vertical migration of groundwater from the shallow aquifer to the semi confined aquifer xi et al 2010 the local evaporation line of semi confined groundwater lel2 is δd 8 50δ 18o 13 26 r2 0 87 the slope is significantly higher than that of lel1 and lmwl fig 6 suggesting the semi confined groundwater has experienced less evaporation than the shallow groundwater the δ 18o and δd values of the semi confined groundwater were similar to the groundwater of the mhr indicating there was a close hydrological connection between them the deep groundwater aquifer of the mhr at 1250 m elevation is less than 60 m deep while the semi confined groundwater in the ejina oasis at 900 m elevation is less than 30 m deep and this hydraulic gradient can promote lateral flow of groundwater from the mhr towards the ejina oasis xi et al 2015 given the similar isotopic characteristics of groundwater in the mhr and the oasis it is reasonable to consider that groundwater from the mhr is a vital recharge source for groundwater in the semi confined aquifer in the ejina oasis the intersection between lel and lmwl indicated a stable isotope composition for the initial groundwater recharge source δi that is a weighted mean of initial precipitation as an effective recharge source dogramaci et al 2012 the calculated δi of the semi confined groundwater was 8 37 for δ 18o and 53 13 for δd which was more negative than the mean δ 18o value of shallow groundwater 6 53 the lateral groundwater flow from mhr 7 47 and the semi confined groundwater 7 79 thus besides the shallow groundwater and the lateral groundwater from mhr some other water source with a more depleted isotopic composition contributed to recharging the semi confined aquifer we considered the confined groundwater as a third potential recharge source for the semi confined aquifer as this water source had the most depleted isotope values there were distributed numerous faults between the semi confined aquifer and the confined aquifer fig 2 which could promote upward flow of the confined groundwater to replenish the semi confined groundwater consequently the shallow groundwater the lateral groundwater flow and the confined groundwater were three potential recharge sources for the semi confined groundwater in the ejina oasis 5 2 quantitative evaluation of recharge source contributions clearly identifying groundwater recharge sources and their corresponding contributions is prerequisite to sustainable management of aquifers to ensure that the needs of humans and ecosystem are met yang et al 2019 the emma was widely used to evaluate the contribution ratio of each recharge source of groundwater guo et al 2015 the oxygen isotope compositions of waters have the potential for use in tracing both sources and flow paths in groundwater systems liu and yamanaka 2012 meanwhile cl is a very conservative tracer and is useful as a groundwater tracer to evaluate groundwater recharge in alluvial sediments huang et al 2017 δ 18o δd and cl values for precipitation river water and groundwater from different aquifers were used to evaluate the contribution ratio of each recharge source to the different groundwater pools in the ejina oasis plots of mean δd vs δ 18o and cl vs δ 18o for groundwater and potential end members show that shallow groundwater was close to the mixing line of precipitation and river water which are two likely end members fig 7 a based on the two component hydrograph separation model calculation we found that about 87 of shallow groundwater was derived from the river water and 13 from the local precipitation in fig 7b the semi confined groundwater was located within the triangle formed by the three potential end members the shallow groundwater the lateral groundwater from the mhr and the confined groundwater based on the three component hydrograph separation model analysis the shallow groundwater the lateral groundwater from mhr and the confined groundwater accounted for 30 52 and 18 of the semi confined groundwater respectively the possible error of the estimated contribution ratio was computed by considering the uncertain composition of end members and groundwater guo et al 2015 a gaussian error estimators based uncertainty propagation technique genereux 1998 was used in this study to estimate uncertainties in tracer based hydrograph separation standard deviation of values δ18o and cl concentration of groundwater and corresponding end members were used to estimate the uncertainty with 70 confidence possible errors of the end members ranged from 3 to 10 table 2 which suggested that the results of the hydrograph separation were considerably reliable within a 10 error range 5 3 conceptual model of groundwater recharge for the different aquifers the hydrogeological data the isotopic and geochemical signatures of groundwater and the recharge sources of groundwater and their contribution ratios were all used to develop a conceptual model for groundwater recharge sources in the ejina oasis fig 8 the aquifers of the ejina oasis can be divided into the shallow aquifer semi confined aquifer and confined aquifer the shallow groundwater was modern water mainly controlled by precipitation and river water and easily influenced by evaporation the semi confined aquifer located between the shallow aquifer and the confined aquifer was influence by the close hydrological connections between with the other two aquifers the relatively low ec and cl concentrations of groundwater in this aquifer suggested slight influence of water rock interaction or recharge by water which has experienced less evaporation the semi confined groundwater is mixture of different water sources with gravity driven vertical infiltration from shallow groundwater due to favorable lithological conditions lateral groundwater from the mhr flow providing more than half of the recharge and upwards seepage from the confined aquifer among these three sources water the lateral groundwater flow from the mhr was a primary source because of the hydraulic gradient and the local good hydrogeological conditions promoting lateral water movement figs 1b and 2 the confined groundwater presented remarkable differences compared the two upper aquifers with the depleted isotopes and low geochemical concentrations ec and cl suggesting weak hydrological connections with the upper two aquifers the confined groundwater likely formed in the paleo climatic humid and cold conditions and flow direction within the aquifer is unclear 5 4 insight for integrated water resources management the shallow and semi confined aquifers experienced different variations in groundwater levels during 1990 2010 with contrasting trends occurring after the ewdp fig 9 a and b the groundwater levels of wells a and b in the shallow aquifer varied from 2 59 m in 1990 to 2 68 m in 2000 and from 1 99 m in 1990 to 2 18 m in 2000 respectively meanwhile the groundwater levels of wells c and d in the semi confined aquifer decreased from 4 02 m in 1990 to 5 54 m in 2000 and from 1 54 m in 1990 to 1 87 m in 2000 respectively the declining groundwater levels in the two aquifers during this period triggered a series of ecological problems at the ejina oasis including the disappearance of the terminal lakes loss of vegetation cover atrophy of natural oases desertification and frequent sandstorm si et al 2015 as part of the ewdp to improve the ecosystem more than 57 82 of the upstream heihe river water was diverted to the ejina oasis zhang et al 2018 in the 2 3 years following the implementation of ewdp the shallow groundwater levels began to rise gradually fig 9a and b the groundwater levels in wells a and b rose to 2 34 m and 1 8 m in 2009 which were higher than the groundwater levels had been in 1990 shallow groundwater levels continued to recover gradually and can now meet the water requirements of the local groundwater dependent ecosystems zhang et al 2017 but there has been a gap between the reality and the expectations in terms of vegetation recovery zhou et al 2018 although the declining trends of the semi confined groundwater levels slowed during three years after the implementation of the ewdp the groundwater levels have continued to decrease in well c and d the highest groundwater levels were appeared in 1990 with 4 02 m and 1 54 m respectively and the lowest levels were measured in 2009 with 6 54 m and 2 06 m before the ewdp the groundwater levels of the two wells have declined 1 52 m and 0 33 m after 2000 the groundwater levels of the two wells have decreased 1 m and 0 13 m fig 9c and d the implementation of ewdp did not change the trajectory of decreasing semi confined groundwater levels yu et al 2018 the evidently different responses of the shallow and semi confined aquifers to the ewdp implementation were attributed to the diversities of recharge sources river water infiltration was the main source of recharge 87 to the shallow aquifer in the ejina oasis once increased surface runoff flowed into the ejina oasis the groundwater level of shallow aquifer was raised in a relatively short time however the semi confined groundwater is a mixture of shallow groundwater 30 lateral groundwater flowing from mhr 52 and confined groundwater 18 it demonstrated that there was a remarkable hydrological connection between the middle and the lower reaches aquifers and emphasized the critical role of groundwater interactions of different aquifers in the ejina oasis after the ewdp began the average runoff of the lanxin mountains station has increased to 5 29 108 m3 during 2000 2010 with an increase of 1 52 108 m3 compared to the level between 1990 and 2000 zhang et al 2018 this resulted in the gradual raise of shallow groundwater level in the ejina oasis but the correlation between the runoff from the middle reaches and groundwater levels in the oasis is not significant due to influence of ecology and hydrogeology yao et al 2015 the area of ejina oasis has increased to 533 04 km2 in 2000 from 704 95 km2 in 2010 in which croplands was the largest contributor li et al 2018 meanwhile the croplands became a main consumer of freshwater resources than the terminal lakes in the oasis zhang et al 2018 the ewdp was designed to allocate more water for environmental use not for supporting agriculture development si et al 2015 thus the expansion of cropland was an unsuitable use of water resources and it has retarded groundwater level and ecosystem restoration in the ejina oasis the decline of the groundwater in the semi confined aquifer was mainly attributed to a reduction in groundwater flow from the mhr as farmers in the oases of the mhr continued to over exploit groundwater for irrigation even after the application of ewdp li et al 2018 the middle reaches has experienced a continuous expansion of cropland of which the total irrigation water volume had increased from 18 71 108 m3 a in 1990 1999 to 19 28 108 m3 a in 2000 2010 with most of the newly reclaimed farmland was only dependent on groundwater irrigation in the middle reaches after 2000 cheng et al 2014 it was reported that groundwater irrigation has increased from 4 04 108 to 6 15 108 m3 a whereas canal irrigation has decreased from 14 67 108 to 13 13 108 m3 a the irrigation activities have caused as much as 1 86 m decline of groundwater level in mhr during the past three decades what may be worrisome in the future with a further 3 06 0 4 m decline till 2050 liu et al 2018 niu et al 2019 evidently the ewdp implementation has indirectly led to an imbalance in the groundwater resource between the midstream and downstream reaches with resulting local vegetation degradation in the middle reaches and there has been an expansion of crop land in the downstream oasis accordingly we should be based on integrated water management of river water and groundwater diversion across the whole basin to promote the recovery of groundwater level of different aquifers it is also necessary to scientifically control the areas of the midstream farmlands and desert oasis at downstream to restrict non ecological water use and to reduce non beneficial evapotranspiration in the ejina oasis for optimizing the water allocation ratio in the basin scale 6 conclusions this research is a systematic attempt to identify recharge sources of shallow semi confined and confined aquifers in the ejina oasis using water isotopes δ 18o and δd and geochemistry ec and cl shallow groundwater is modern water which originates from 13 of local precipitation and 87 of river water infiltration recharge while the confined groundwater likely formed in the paleo climatic humid and cold conditions that prevailed during the late pleistocene and the early holocene is old water and non renewable the semi confined groundwater is mixed water which deriving from 30 of the shallow groundwater 52 of the lateral groundwater from the mhr and 18 of confined groundwater after implementation of the ewdp shallow groundwater levels increased due to diversions of the heihe river into the ejina oasis and river water infiltration however the semi confined groundwater levels continued to decline due to decreased recharge from the mhr where groundwater was over exploited for irrigation all this information can be included in integrated water management efforts that account for river water and groundwater diversion across the watershed

6064,this study considers the effects of wind field forcing data on a 3 d hydrodynamic model of two connected urban lakes in central finland one of which is used as municipal water source we consider the wind data from a nearby official weather station local winds measured at several sites at the target lakes and winds obtained by spatio temporal modelling dispersion of tracers was simulated in the lakes in order to assess the propagation of a contaminant cloud and especially the possibility of contaminants reaching the municipal water source we found that there can be important differences in tracer transport timing and path depending of the wind field used in the model no clearly superior method for obtaining the wind field was found spatial wind fields can improve lake model predictions when lakes are fragmented and sheltered lake model performance can be further improved by ensemble modelling approach keywords currents lakes computational modelling tracer wind field water flow 1 introduction computational modelling is a commonly used method to estimate e g environmental effects of waste waters from industry and municipalities as a cost effective and transparent way to study different scenarios it can provide important information for decision makers types of models range from simple mass balance calculations to realistic coupled hydrodynamical ecological models nowadays data including e g bathymetry weather and boundary flow measurements needed to create and run a realistic hydrodynamic model are becoming openly accessible in many countries in the european union open access data policies have been mandated by the directive public sector information psi directive 2013 37 eu and in finland all data obtained by public entities have been open since 1999 act on the openness of government activities 621 1999 elsewhere especially in the united states noaa began to release weather information already in 1970s and unites states has continued making information resources accessible discoverable and usable by the public open data policy m 13 13 continuously increasing abundance of publicly available data has made it feasible to build lake models in many locations without an extensive local measurement campaign using weather forcing data from the nearest meteorological station as one of the most important forcing data for a hydrodynamic model meteorological data is ideally obtained at or nearby a study area the effect of winds on the water circulation pattern is a well known phenomenon krauss 2001 wu et al 2018 and references within and theoretical descriptions of near surface currents to wind forcing are well established stokes 1847 ekman 1905 longuet higgins 1953 1960 dobroklonskiy 1969 gonella 1971 lai and rao 1976 madsen 1977 pollard 1970 weber 1981 davies 1985a b however experiments usually show deviations from theoretical values like in case of deflection angle between wind and currents shulman and bryson 1961 furthermore the assumption that wind is spatially homogeneous could result in considerable errors in the flow field simulations podsetchine and schernewski 1999 significance of non homogenous wind field was also observed at keszthely bay of lake balaton where the simulated currents were in poor agreement with the observations when a conventional uniform wind shear pattern was applied józsa et al 1990 in that study the best fit of simulated flow to the observed pattern was achieved by empirically adjusting the spatial distribution of wind shear stresses starting with zero along the coast and increasing it linearly with a distance from the shore up to its full value in terms of the fetch length the reasons for this considerable spatial wind variation were found to be the surrounding topography the sheltering effect of trees and buildings on the shore and the nonuniform lake surface roughness still most of the studies use uniform wind field over the entire lake without taking into account the shelter of banks and islands falconer et al 1991 wu et al 2018 knowledge of local wind conditions and spatial heterogeneity of the wind stress over the lake is especially important for fragmented lakes having fairly small basins and on the littoral zone of all lakes many lakes at high latitudes in siberia scandinavia canada and alaska are small having formed after continental ice receded after the last ice age for example in finland only about 1 4 of lakes are larger than one square kilometer by area raatikainen and kuusisto 1990 typically these lakes can be wind sheltered for some hundreds of meters from shore local wind fields consist of lake breeze and are affected by morphological factors of the surrounding terrain such as channelling heterogeneous wind field has been shown to have an effect on phytoplankton patchiness on a small lake schernewski et al 2005 the effect of local wind forcing on computational models signell et al 2005 has been already considered along with other small scale features rasmussen et al 2009 however their small scale resolution is high about 600 m compared to the features and length scales in finnish lakes which can be as small as 10 m in lagrangian interpretation of particle transport it is well recognized that wind field is the most significant driving force yu et al 2017 despite recognition of the effects of heterogeneous wind fields on lake currents and the ability to model spatial wind variability over lakes venäläinen et al 2003 actual usage of spatial wind fields on lake simulations is rare one reason for this is the lack of cost effective way to computationally model the wind fields validation of computational flow models can be challenging one problem arises when frequency of some forcing data e g discharge or surface height is only available as daily average while meteorological data might be available at up to 1 min intervals at least for small and shallow lakes this can lead to situations where there are delayed features on the time series comparing simulated currents to measured currents evaluating goodness of fit using root mean square error rmse might give some answers suitable coefficients can be developed on a case by case basis using statistical methods and tools in a study of ecosystem dynamics lhermitte et al 2015 a few coefficients are listed and their characteristics are discussed in general different coefficients are sensitive to different aspects of the data some are sensitive to magnitudes while others can be used to characterize temporal aspects such as timings and delays lhermitte et al 2015 all point to point goodness of fit measures penalizes deviation from observation even though similar but temporally displaced behavior is present in the studied time series therefore point to point measures are misleading in cases where both time series show similar temporal behavior but with different timings there exists other estimators such as dynamic time warping dtw used e g in the field of speech recognition to find a best available match by non linearly modifying the time axes berndt and clifford 1994 ordinary pearson correlation coefficient is merely a measure for linearity and it is a poor estimator for similarity rodgers and alan nicewander 1988 lhermitte et al 2015 the often used concordance correlation coefficient is better suited to measure the agreement of two variables or time series in some cases it is critical to have an accurate description of local wind and consequently the lake flow field for example an accident near a water body can result in an oil spill or release of other harmful chemicals to the lake from a risk management point of view the ability to track and predict substance transport through the water body is crucial also assessing the risk to vulnerable sites like raw water resources and spawning areas of valuable fish can greatly benefit from realistic computational modelling methods karjalainen et al 2019 in our study area a municipal raw water intake is located within the study area where correctly predicting the advection of hazardous substances e g from a chemical spill originating from a nearby road accident or algae bloom is deemed necessary in this paper we examine the performance of a hydrodynamic model of two small connected lakes using local wind forcing data obtained by several different methods we study how the different wind fields affect the currents and dispersion of imaginary tracers within the model in the first part of the paper we introduce the study area and measurements section 2 presents the different methods used section 3 presents the results of local wind field calculations by different methods and the effect of wind forcing on the water currents finally section 4 discusses the results and concludes the paper 2 material and methods 2 1 study area our study area the coupled lakes tuomiojärvi and palokkajärvi and their upstream lake system are located in central finland in the city of jyväskylä both lakes are classified as small humic lakes surface area a of lake tuomiojärvi is 298 ha h mean depth is 3 5 m maximum depth mh is 13 1 m and volume v is 10 3 10 6 m 3 corresponding characteristics for lake palokkajärvi are a 258 ha h 2 8 m mh 10 1 m and v 7 2 10 6 m 3 main inflow river pappilanjoki to the lakes tuomiojärvi and palokkajärvi system is located in the northern part of lake palokkajärvi and the outflow river tourujoki is in the southern part of the same lake there are only few low current brooks feeding lake tuomiojärvi from its catchment the biggest inflow to lake tuomiojärvi is brook syväoja located in north west fig 1 the two lakes are connected by a short river called löylyjoki that is 130 m long 5 m wide and 0 9 m deep on average due to dredging and to various crossing bridges it resembles more an artificial channel than a natural river river löylyjoki has been observed to flow in both directions the european route 75 e75 a major highway running through europe from the arctic sea to the mediterranean sea crosses over river löylyjoki and runs on a narrow isthmus between the study lakes tuomiojärvi and palokkajärvi the two lakes differ in water quality with lake tuomiojärvi being in better condition when nutrients turbidity and color are examined river pappilanjoki transports nutrients and suspended solids to lake palokkajärvi lake tuomiojärvi also serves as a surface water source for municipal drinking water for the city of jyväskylä 2 2 current measurements discharges were measured in brook syväoja with a handheld current meter in year 2016 discharge measurements were conducted approximately weekly during ice free period with a handheld acoustic sontek flowtracker device discharge data for river tourujoki and water level data for lake palokkajärvi were obtained from an open database maintained by finnish environment institute hertta database and the intake for potable water was obtained from the waterworks fixed continuously measuring current meter was anchored to the desired location 62 26557 25 7385 and depth measures 1 m from surface in this study we used aanderaa rcm9 device measuring currents at ten minute intervals in 2015 fig 1 2 3 meteorological data meteorological data from tikkakoski airport located approximately 15 km north of the study lakes was obtained through finnish meteorological institute fmi open data services the data consisted wind speed and direction measured at 10 m air temperature cloudiness humidity and rain intensity local meteorological field stations were installed at and in the vicinity of lake tuomiojärvi and lake palokkajärvi by the authors during summer 2015 fig 1 the stations were set up to measure wind speed and wind direction at 5 min intervals and air temperature relative humidity and rainfall at 15 min intervals all observed values are 5 min averages description of surroundings of each of the measurement stations are given in appendix a 2 4 wind field modelling we estimated local wind fields around the two lakes using a spatial temporal model based on wind data observed at the local stations fig 1 this chapter outlines the modelling methodology and shows some results the details of the modelling are described in appendix b in this study we combined two methodologies time series analysis and spatial analysis interpolation in specific auto regressive ar models and kriging are used for the time series analysis and spatial interpolation respectively the modelling procedure in this study is shown in fig 2 as a flowchart first basic statistical data analysis is carried out to investigate the stochastic characteristics such as stationarity and auto cross correlations of the wind directions and speeds second an appropriate temporal model is selected based on the results of the statistical analysis we selected one dimensional auto regressive ar models as the temporal models third the model parameters are estimated using a optimization method in this study we estimated the ar coefficients using direct monte carlo method with 100 000 samples finally spatially sparse wind data at each time step are statistically interpolated by the kriging this spatial temporal model can estimate wind direction and speed at any location and any time step with low computational cost appendix b fig b5 hereafter the obtained model is referred to as s t model 2 5 hydrodynamic modelling 2 5 1 lake circulation model we used version 2 9 of the coherens model luyten 2013 as our 3d hydrodynamic model to provide the physics related to advection diffusion coherens is an ocean circulation model that solves navier stokes equations using the boussinesq approximation and the assumption of vertical hydrostatic equilibrium the primitive equations are solved in a horizontally uniform rectangular grid with the resolution of 50 m for both of the horizontal directions 76 and 85 grid cells in west east and south north directions respectively and with 10 σ layers directions east to west and south to north are hereafter referred as x and y directions the water column is always divided into 10 layers at regular intervals for each lake grid point i the model runs were started from rest i e initial values of 0 were used for currents and concentrations and 5 c for temperature continuous release was started immediately but accidental releases after 177 h of running the model in the model we consider the four biggest inflows and outflows of the lakes surface height was used as a boundary condition for river pappilanjoki and discharges for river tourujoki brook syväoja as well as for the intake of potable water for brook syväoja we generated the daily discharge values based on a statistical model that utilized rainfall data obtained from fmi open data service and our own discharge measurements performed in open water period in the year 2016 we implemented a simple transport module to version 2 9 of coherens based on coherens version 1 luyten et al 1999 we set the model up to follow the dispersion of a imaginary tracer from three different sources 1 an accident on the bridge over river löylyjoki 2 a leakage from a sewage pipe installed on the bottom of lake palokkajärvi 3 and an accident on the narrow ridge between lakes on the european route 75 fig 1 in scenarios 1 3 the imaginary tracer release is instantaneous duration of the release is half an hour and the amount of material approximately corresponds to the carrying capacity of semi truck and is 30 m3 with an arbitrary concentration of 1 unit l for sites 1 and 3 the imaginary tracer is discharged to the surface and for site 2 to the bottom we consider concentrations in several observation points located in both lakes and also in the middle of river löylyjoki see fig 1 in lake tuomiojärvi the observation locations are the water intake pipe mouth of waterworks and the narrow passage between northern and southern basins for lake palokkajärvi those observation locations are at the mouths of the rivers pappilanjoki and tourujoki 3 results in this chapter we discuss the effects of temporal accuracy of wind forcing to the lake model as well as compare three wind forcing options representing different aspects of local wind fields two of them are direct measurement values lehtisaari and kaijala see fig 1 and the third one is the wind field obtained using the spatio temporal modelling discussed in chapter wind field modelling the obtained results are compared to corresponding wind data at the tikkakoski airport 3 1 effect of different wind forcing to currents in general the simulated currents follow the y component of the measured current more closely than the x component fig 3 and appendix d this is due to the fact that this direction is almost in the direction of the main flow we found that none of the wind forcing options was clearly better than other when comparing the simulation results to the observed currents different wind forcing catches different features in different times and misses others furthermore goodness of fit measures are dependent of the model grid location chosen to correspond the current measurement location moving one vertical or horizontal step from a selected point affects to the goodness of fit measures and also the visual correspondence between simulation results and measurement if we consider obtained time series as probability distributions or histograms we observe that there are no big differences between magnitudes of simulated currents although there is bigger deviation in the direction fig 4 again choosing a different grid location to represent measurement location affects the correspondence between measurement and simulation results however the best statistical correspondence leads to poorer visual correspondence between the time series root mean square error values compared to flow fields from lake simulation performed using tikkakoski wind data are presented for all lake model lattice points and same sigma layer for simulations using wind data from the a s t model and b kaijala fig 5 in both comparisons similar spatial locations are highlighted flow fields from simulation performed using s t model wind deviate more from simulation using tikkakoski wind data than is the case when using kaijala wind fields this can be seen from fig 5a and b and more directly from fig 5c the magnitude of the deviation is related to the depth of the comparison point since in a spatially homogenous sigma layer system the thickness of a layer depends on depth for shallower points the layer thickness is lower and wind forcing causes higher surface flow speeds although the main flow direction through river löylyjoki is usually from lake tuomiojärvi to lake palokkajärvi it is quite common that the direction of flow changes now and then see fig 6 roughly estimated the change of flow direction back flow can occur at high water with suitable wind the duration of back flow situations are usually short see fig 7 it is even possible for the flow direction to change within the time it takes to make a single discharge measurement of river löylyjoki using a hand held measurement device it is expected that different wind forcing also has an effect on the timing and duration of back flow events this can be seen from figs 6 and 7 with s t model wind forcing the back flow event is ongoing simultaneously with the releases of the imaginary tracers in addition the duration of back flow events is shortest for s t model wind forcing there are subtle timing differences of back flow events throughout the study period when using s t model wind forcing the timing differences are small furthermore there is also a clear threshold value about 1 h for forcing frequency after which the shape of the probability distribution changes for low frequency longer time between forcing data short backflow events occur at a smaller probability when compared to the higher frequencies for low frequencies also longer backflow events are more probable than for higher frequencies 3 2 effect of wind forcing to dispersion although different wind forcing data has noticeable differences to the timings and durations of the backflow events it does not necessary guarantee that these deviations would be enough to create big effects when considered the dispersion of imaginary tracers to the lake system this is caused due to the fact that a long lasting back flow event does not automatically mean a larger volume of water actually transported backwards 3 2 1 instantaneous sources 3 2 1 1 arrival times of the plume for different wind forcing the arrival of the concentration plume of an imaginary tracer released from three different locations has been calculated for different wind forcing frequencies local measured wind observations kaijala and lehtisaari and for the s t model that uses all available measured wind data the cases using different wind forcing frequencies are later referred to temporal cases and the cases using local wind data and s t model data to spatial arrival times are presented again for 5 different locations that are same than in the arrival time inspection within the selected observation locations see fig 1 the water intake location is the most interesting based on simulations the imaginary plume would arrive in the shortest time when using the s t model wind from location 1 10 5 h see figs 1 and 11 using other spatial forcing the plume arrives much later from location 1 kaijala 219 8 h and lehtisaari 157 3 h by high updating rate of wind forcing arrival times of plume are about 30 h while for low updating rate they are between 171 8 and 173 3 h from location 3 plumes arrives simultaneously by kaijala and s t model wind 158 5 h and much later by kaijala winds 220 h regardless of the updating rate of tikkakoski wind data the plumes arrive about 172 h these arrival times are same or later when using low updating rate of wind forcing for high updating rate of wind forcing arrival times of imaginary tracer are about 30 h from location 1 but for location 2 arrival times are same regardless the frequency release from location 2 although being closest to release location 1 arrives fastest by the tikkakoski forcing if applied with frequencies greater than the threshold value between 15 and 60 min fig 8 information shown in fig 5 and 6b helps understand why this happens the traveling time from location 2 to the river takes such a long time that the plume misses the first backflow event of the s t model and the first backflow event of tikkakoski forcing is earlier than the second backflow event of s t model forcing hence the plume arrives faster to river löylyjoki and water intake observation point from release location 2 behavior of arrival times of the observation locations located at lake tuomiojärvi can be mostly explained by dynamics of river löylyjoki from time to time effects of the local dynamics of the lake tuomiojärvi are so big that river löylyjoki changes flow direction when the observation location is at either the mouth of river tourujoki or river pappilanjoki there are no big differences between arrival times between wind forcing used but the arrival time of the plume from location 3 to mouth of river pappilanjoki is smaller than from others release locations 3 2 1 2 effect of wind forcing to concentration time series the peaks in concentration time series observed at the water intake location presented in fig 9 are caused by short pulses i e back flow events coming through river löylyjoki since there are no other sources within lake tuomiojärvi the concentration is decreasing between backward pulses of the current due the outflow from river löylyjoki and dispersion within the lake the biggest clearly visible differences between time series are the timing of peaks and their magnitude or entire lack of peaks based on time series presented in fig 9a it is clear that the timing of back flow of river löylyjoki and release of harmful substances from place 1 bridge over river löylyjoki are almost identical since the front plume reaches the water intake locations much more rapidly than by other wind forcing in addition the amount of imaginary tracer coming in this first occasion is so high that other back flow induced plumes cannot be resolved from the higher background concentration although the water intake location is the closest observation point to the release locations not all concentration bursts caused by back flow events are visible because depending on the local wind the burst can move to a direction different from the water intake location depending of the length of this journey the burst will disperse and it might not be visible at all in water intake location thus the concentration peaks in fig 9 do not reflect perfectly the back flow events timing presented in fig 6 for river löylyjoki observation location the concentrations vary in a range 10 8 10 6 not shown values close to 10 8 can be associated to a flow coming from lake tuomiojärvi and higher values for a flow coming from lake palokkajärvi based on the concentration time series it is difficult to determine any systematic deviations between the wind forcing data applied spatial differences between concentration fields are clear fig 10 3 2 2 continuous source continuous release from river pappilanjoki behaves quite similarly when compared to instantaneous releases considered above in chapter 3 2 1 fig 11 in observation locations on lake tuomiojärvi and river tourujoki there are less shifting between wind forcing that produce the highest concentration fig 11a d and e in other observation places the shifting is frequent especially in river pappilanjoki fig 11c this is expected since the observation point is near the source although incoming concentration and water height boundary conditions were the same for all simulated wind forcing scenarios the amount of imaginary tracer mass coming into the lake can change between simulations this is due the fact that water level boundary condition follows given water height and flow direction and speed can change to fulfill this restriction also changing the amount of incoming imaginary tracer this partially explains why the wind scenario causing the highest concentration values fluctuates as much as it does wind effect on concentration at different parts of lake tuomiojärvi is quite similar fig 11a water intake and 11e narrow passage at lake tuomiojärvi the levels are generally smaller because tracer released to lake palokkajärvi can only be transported to lake tuomiojärvi during backflow events through river löylyjoki as lake tuomiojärvi and lake palokkajärvi are in a delicate balance fig 11b we can see wind forcing scenario specific differences in water exchange and concentrations the fluctuation is combined to timings of backflow events caused by frequent changes of wind relevant question is how much of the loading and in what concentration can be transported to a critical area of interest e g a water intake or a recreational area one way to formulate the relative concentration difference caused by different wind forcing scenarios is by the equation s x concentration b y x w i n d d a t a concentration b y t i k k a k o s k i w i n d d a t a 1 100 where sx is relative concentration difference x refers to kaijala lehtisaari or s t model wind data fig 11 naturally the meaningfulness of the concentration differences strongly depends on the substances considered and therefore it cannot be said in general which deviation is too small or big to matter since at the beginning of the simulation the lakes are at zero concentration there are huge fluctuations in relative concentration differences before the imaginary tracer disperses to the whole lake system fig 12 for those locations that are located far from source this naturally takes more time than for those located closer at the vicinity of the source i e near river pappilanjoki the deviation of s t model simulated concentration values compared to tikkakoski data driven simulation can be as high as 200 from time to time fig 12a i e three times higher between those extremes difference at the negative side of zero but it fluctuates constantly to positive side see fig 13 for other wind scenarios the differences are small and the fluctuations occur symmetrically around zero generally the greater fluctuations are at observation points located on the western shoreline magnitude of the fluctuation decreases as a function of distance to the observation location as expected in the vicinity of river löylyjoki the analysis becomes more difficult since the water exchange between the two lakes increases the fluctuations here the s t model data causes the largest deviations compared to tikkakoski wind forcing data since the s t model data is derived from observation data measured on site kaijala and lehtisaari included the deviations are expected to be caused by s t model s spatial variability 4 discussion our results from a typical nordic lake confirm the earlier results of the importance of local wind field venäläinen et al 2003 the widely used approach using the synoptic wind data from a nearby airport may lead to significant biases especially in wind direction data the wind field over the lakes was very heterogeneous in this study as well as in case for lakes längelmävesi and roine venäläinen et al 2003 the surrounding terrain in our case had altitude variations up to 110 m whereas in the case of lakes längelmävesi and roine by venäläinen et al 2003 the altitude difference between the lake and highest hill top in the surroundings was only half of that in that case wind station situated on the middle of the pelagic zone of the lake we found that in addition to variations in lake flow fields induced by winds blowing from different directions the different wind forcing had also a noticeable effect on timing and duration of back flow events in river löylyjoki as well as the shape and travel time of the imaginary tracer plume within the lakes measured and modelled timings of back flow events are not necessarily matched by increasing the frequency of wind forcing since surface stress and heat exchange processes are based on 10 min average wind large and pond 1981 it is not straightforward to determine which of the wind forcing used in the model gives the most realistic flow field especially when limited number of measurement devices is used to obtain calibration data this is especially true when comparing spatially different wind forcing data sets that all use the same temporal resolution all the local wind fields produced slightly different flow fields which was obvious also from the dispersion of an imaginary tracer there was one modelled situation where the imaginary tracer concentration at a certain observation point differed more than 20 between different wind forcing when studying tracer dispersion computationally it might not be enough to use only average scenarios but also quantify the risk of rapid tracer transport to vulnerable locations in the study area however small deviations in concentration can be also important when considering long term exposure to harmful substances and bioaccumulation to aquatic fauna short term spreading in various forcing scenarios as well as long term effects of concentrations should therefore be considered in risk analyses delivered to e g decision makers one approach to quantify model uncertainty is to use an ensemble modelling approach stott and forest 2007 it is well known that different models do not always produce the same result with the same input data despite the fact that they are all sound i e every choice that has been made can be justified by scientific arguments pearson et al 2006 best guess for future is usually the mean makridakis and winkler 1983 or median behavior of the models and the limits of possible outcomes are derived from results which deviate most from the median ensemble modelling is a wide term and short summary of its variability is given by araujo and new 2007 and it can be used even in situations where outcomes from various models are used as inputs to another models gain et al 2011 for instantaneous release of tracer i e accident scenario the concentration differences between model runs using different local wind fields are closely connected to the dynamics of the connected lakes that is the short term timing of events determines how the tracer will disperse for continuous release also the long term or averaged behavior of the system becomes important when using one of the local wind field variations as atmospheric forcing in lake flow simulations the one obtained by spatio temporal modelling s t model caused the largest deviations compared to the simulations using tikkakoski wind data in most cases this is somewhat surprising since it is derived from local wind data of both kaijala and lehtisaari and results from simulations using kaijala or lehtisaari wind data separately largely follow results from simulations using tikkakoski wind data one reason for this is that there is spatial variability in the s t model that is missing from the others the spatial resolution 50 m 50 m of the s t model coincides with the lake model resolution which can cause larger variations in the surface stress between the model grid points the wind data is usually much coarser spatially in most case studies using coherens or other ocean models to calculate the hydrodynamic transports wind forcing has notable effects on the current fields and dispersion of tracers choosing the best wind forcing is however problematic since calibration of 3 d circulation model to current measurements is problematic when average flow velocities fluctuate around zero one complication is deciding the criteria on how to choose the model parametrizations including applying forcing data to produce the closest correspondence between observations and model results some of the goodness of fit measures are well known such as rmse and concordance correlation and others have been tailored to suit this particular study case appendix d table d1 before using any coefficient to measure the goodness of fit it is vital know the process leading to the observed time series taking into account the differences in forcing data grid size and measurement device specifications the obtained simulated currents are qualitatively sufficient for this study 5 conclusions effects of different wind forcing data to the modelled dynamics of the lake and dispersion of instantaneous and continuous release was studied on the connected lakes tuomiojärvi and palokkajärvi the different wind forcings had a notable effect on the lake flow fields and also had a clear effect on the dispersion of imaginary tracers within a lake system we also found that the applied wind forcing scenarios introduced differences on the dynamics of river löylyjoki connecting our study lakes this river controls the amount of imaginary tracer entering to lake tuomiojärvi none of the methods to obtain local wind forcing for the model was found clearly superior to the others obtaining a reliable description of a wind field on the lakes is made significantly more complicated by the convoluted shorelines simultaneous use of multiple local wind assessment methods in estimating the dispersion of tracer transport could give a sound basis for risk assessment for example in order to guarantee municipal water safety it is of vital importance to know how quickly an accidental release of substances could be transported to the surface water intake we also found that care must be taken when comparing modelled flow field results to measurement data obtained with a relatively inaccurate current meter in limited number of locations the analysis of flow data versus model results proved to be inconclusive therefore in the future a spatially extended measuring campaign with devices more suited to lake environment is required furthermore more studies are needed to determine the relationship and required spatial accuracy of both wind forcing data and the 3 d hydrodynamic lake model declaration of competing interest the authors declare the following financial interests personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests researcher from finnish environment institute has got funding from company jyväskylän energia oy for creating calibrated and validated 3d flow model for the study area

appendix b spatial temporal modelling of local wind fields stochastic characteristics of time series data as the first step of the spatial temporal modelling of wind speed and direction we developed a one dimensional temporal model based on the observed wind data at each station and a time series analysis fig 2 fig b1 shows the time series data of wind speed and direction observed at viitaniemi station from 1st august to 30th september 2015 the horizontal axis indicates time step which means 15 min step we studied stochastic characteristics auto correlation function acf and cross correlation function ccf of the time series data the sample acf c k and sample ccf c k i j are defined as b1 c k 1 n n k 1 n y n μ y n k μ b2 c k i j 1 n n k 1 n y n i μ i y n k j μ j where n is the number of data k is lag and yn is observation data at n th step in this study yn i and yn j indicate wind direction and wind speed respectively sample mean μ is is defined as b3 μ 1 n n 1 n y n although the curves of the computed sample acf have periodic components both of the acf of wind speed and direction decrease with increasing lag and converge into zero fig b2 these trends are often seen as time series data following stationary process therefore we assumed that the time series data follow stationary process and employed auto regressive models ar model for temporal modelling although the curves of sample ccf between the wind direction and speed have small periodic components the correlation coefficients are less than 0 25 see fig b3 therefore the correlation between wind direction and speed is relatively low this fact means that we can treat wind speed and direction independently and make one dimensional ar models for each observation data time series modelling e g kitagawa 2010 based on the results of the acf and the ccf we made a one dimensional ar model for each observation data as time series data are given n th data yn can be estimated by the ar model which is defined as

spatial interpolation for the one dimensional time series data generated by the ar model the kriging is a method for spatial interpolation for data at given points by calculate a weighted mean of the

wind fields by combining the ar model and the ordinary kriging spatial temporal modelling of local wind fields can be achieved although the proposed method provides wind fields near the surface of the lakes wind speed changes with altitude i e wind speed increases with increasing altitude in order to consider the effect of altitude the wind profile power law robeson and shein 1997 was applied to the estimated wind speed the power law is defined as b9 u u ref z z ref α where u is wind speed at height z u ref is known wind speed at known altitude z ref and α is an empirically derived coefficient that is dependent upon the stability of the atmosphere and is usually set as 0 143 the u ref and z ref are estimated by the proposed spatial temporal modelling appendix c modelling daily discharges of brook syväoja we conducted discharge measurement of brook syväoja approximately weekly in open water period in the year 2016 based on this discharge data and precipitation data available we obtained equation describing the discharges this estimation of brook syväoja discharge is obtained by finding such amount of accumulated water that minimizes the total deviation from observations i e we conducted least square fittings for various amounts of accumulated water to find the value that minimizes the difference fig c1 the best fit was gained by using accumulated rainfall during previous 17 5 days of a discharge measurement estimated discharge values describe well the observations fig c2 appendix d see table d1 
6064,this study considers the effects of wind field forcing data on a 3 d hydrodynamic model of two connected urban lakes in central finland one of which is used as municipal water source we consider the wind data from a nearby official weather station local winds measured at several sites at the target lakes and winds obtained by spatio temporal modelling dispersion of tracers was simulated in the lakes in order to assess the propagation of a contaminant cloud and especially the possibility of contaminants reaching the municipal water source we found that there can be important differences in tracer transport timing and path depending of the wind field used in the model no clearly superior method for obtaining the wind field was found spatial wind fields can improve lake model predictions when lakes are fragmented and sheltered lake model performance can be further improved by ensemble modelling approach keywords currents lakes computational modelling tracer wind field water flow 1 introduction computational modelling is a commonly used method to estimate e g environmental effects of waste waters from industry and municipalities as a cost effective and transparent way to study different scenarios it can provide important information for decision makers types of models range from simple mass balance calculations to realistic coupled hydrodynamical ecological models nowadays data including e g bathymetry weather and boundary flow measurements needed to create and run a realistic hydrodynamic model are becoming openly accessible in many countries in the european union open access data policies have been mandated by the directive public sector information psi directive 2013 37 eu and in finland all data obtained by public entities have been open since 1999 act on the openness of government activities 621 1999 elsewhere especially in the united states noaa began to release weather information already in 1970s and unites states has continued making information resources accessible discoverable and usable by the public open data policy m 13 13 continuously increasing abundance of publicly available data has made it feasible to build lake models in many locations without an extensive local measurement campaign using weather forcing data from the nearest meteorological station as one of the most important forcing data for a hydrodynamic model meteorological data is ideally obtained at or nearby a study area the effect of winds on the water circulation pattern is a well known phenomenon krauss 2001 wu et al 2018 and references within and theoretical descriptions of near surface currents to wind forcing are well established stokes 1847 ekman 1905 longuet higgins 1953 1960 dobroklonskiy 1969 gonella 1971 lai and rao 1976 madsen 1977 pollard 1970 weber 1981 davies 1985a b however experiments usually show deviations from theoretical values like in case of deflection angle between wind and currents shulman and bryson 1961 furthermore the assumption that wind is spatially homogeneous could result in considerable errors in the flow field simulations podsetchine and schernewski 1999 significance of non homogenous wind field was also observed at keszthely bay of lake balaton where the simulated currents were in poor agreement with the observations when a conventional uniform wind shear pattern was applied józsa et al 1990 in that study the best fit of simulated flow to the observed pattern was achieved by empirically adjusting the spatial distribution of wind shear stresses starting with zero along the coast and increasing it linearly with a distance from the shore up to its full value in terms of the fetch length the reasons for this considerable spatial wind variation were found to be the surrounding topography the sheltering effect of trees and buildings on the shore and the nonuniform lake surface roughness still most of the studies use uniform wind field over the entire lake without taking into account the shelter of banks and islands falconer et al 1991 wu et al 2018 knowledge of local wind conditions and spatial heterogeneity of the wind stress over the lake is especially important for fragmented lakes having fairly small basins and on the littoral zone of all lakes many lakes at high latitudes in siberia scandinavia canada and alaska are small having formed after continental ice receded after the last ice age for example in finland only about 1 4 of lakes are larger than one square kilometer by area raatikainen and kuusisto 1990 typically these lakes can be wind sheltered for some hundreds of meters from shore local wind fields consist of lake breeze and are affected by morphological factors of the surrounding terrain such as channelling heterogeneous wind field has been shown to have an effect on phytoplankton patchiness on a small lake schernewski et al 2005 the effect of local wind forcing on computational models signell et al 2005 has been already considered along with other small scale features rasmussen et al 2009 however their small scale resolution is high about 600 m compared to the features and length scales in finnish lakes which can be as small as 10 m in lagrangian interpretation of particle transport it is well recognized that wind field is the most significant driving force yu et al 2017 despite recognition of the effects of heterogeneous wind fields on lake currents and the ability to model spatial wind variability over lakes venäläinen et al 2003 actual usage of spatial wind fields on lake simulations is rare one reason for this is the lack of cost effective way to computationally model the wind fields validation of computational flow models can be challenging one problem arises when frequency of some forcing data e g discharge or surface height is only available as daily average while meteorological data might be available at up to 1 min intervals at least for small and shallow lakes this can lead to situations where there are delayed features on the time series comparing simulated currents to measured currents evaluating goodness of fit using root mean square error rmse might give some answers suitable coefficients can be developed on a case by case basis using statistical methods and tools in a study of ecosystem dynamics lhermitte et al 2015 a few coefficients are listed and their characteristics are discussed in general different coefficients are sensitive to different aspects of the data some are sensitive to magnitudes while others can be used to characterize temporal aspects such as timings and delays lhermitte et al 2015 all point to point goodness of fit measures penalizes deviation from observation even though similar but temporally displaced behavior is present in the studied time series therefore point to point measures are misleading in cases where both time series show similar temporal behavior but with different timings there exists other estimators such as dynamic time warping dtw used e g in the field of speech recognition to find a best available match by non linearly modifying the time axes berndt and clifford 1994 ordinary pearson correlation coefficient is merely a measure for linearity and it is a poor estimator for similarity rodgers and alan nicewander 1988 lhermitte et al 2015 the often used concordance correlation coefficient is better suited to measure the agreement of two variables or time series in some cases it is critical to have an accurate description of local wind and consequently the lake flow field for example an accident near a water body can result in an oil spill or release of other harmful chemicals to the lake from a risk management point of view the ability to track and predict substance transport through the water body is crucial also assessing the risk to vulnerable sites like raw water resources and spawning areas of valuable fish can greatly benefit from realistic computational modelling methods karjalainen et al 2019 in our study area a municipal raw water intake is located within the study area where correctly predicting the advection of hazardous substances e g from a chemical spill originating from a nearby road accident or algae bloom is deemed necessary in this paper we examine the performance of a hydrodynamic model of two small connected lakes using local wind forcing data obtained by several different methods we study how the different wind fields affect the currents and dispersion of imaginary tracers within the model in the first part of the paper we introduce the study area and measurements section 2 presents the different methods used section 3 presents the results of local wind field calculations by different methods and the effect of wind forcing on the water currents finally section 4 discusses the results and concludes the paper 2 material and methods 2 1 study area our study area the coupled lakes tuomiojärvi and palokkajärvi and their upstream lake system are located in central finland in the city of jyväskylä both lakes are classified as small humic lakes surface area a of lake tuomiojärvi is 298 ha h mean depth is 3 5 m maximum depth mh is 13 1 m and volume v is 10 3 10 6 m 3 corresponding characteristics for lake palokkajärvi are a 258 ha h 2 8 m mh 10 1 m and v 7 2 10 6 m 3 main inflow river pappilanjoki to the lakes tuomiojärvi and palokkajärvi system is located in the northern part of lake palokkajärvi and the outflow river tourujoki is in the southern part of the same lake there are only few low current brooks feeding lake tuomiojärvi from its catchment the biggest inflow to lake tuomiojärvi is brook syväoja located in north west fig 1 the two lakes are connected by a short river called löylyjoki that is 130 m long 5 m wide and 0 9 m deep on average due to dredging and to various crossing bridges it resembles more an artificial channel than a natural river river löylyjoki has been observed to flow in both directions the european route 75 e75 a major highway running through europe from the arctic sea to the mediterranean sea crosses over river löylyjoki and runs on a narrow isthmus between the study lakes tuomiojärvi and palokkajärvi the two lakes differ in water quality with lake tuomiojärvi being in better condition when nutrients turbidity and color are examined river pappilanjoki transports nutrients and suspended solids to lake palokkajärvi lake tuomiojärvi also serves as a surface water source for municipal drinking water for the city of jyväskylä 2 2 current measurements discharges were measured in brook syväoja with a handheld current meter in year 2016 discharge measurements were conducted approximately weekly during ice free period with a handheld acoustic sontek flowtracker device discharge data for river tourujoki and water level data for lake palokkajärvi were obtained from an open database maintained by finnish environment institute hertta database and the intake for potable water was obtained from the waterworks fixed continuously measuring current meter was anchored to the desired location 62 26557 25 7385 and depth measures 1 m from surface in this study we used aanderaa rcm9 device measuring currents at ten minute intervals in 2015 fig 1 2 3 meteorological data meteorological data from tikkakoski airport located approximately 15 km north of the study lakes was obtained through finnish meteorological institute fmi open data services the data consisted wind speed and direction measured at 10 m air temperature cloudiness humidity and rain intensity local meteorological field stations were installed at and in the vicinity of lake tuomiojärvi and lake palokkajärvi by the authors during summer 2015 fig 1 the stations were set up to measure wind speed and wind direction at 5 min intervals and air temperature relative humidity and rainfall at 15 min intervals all observed values are 5 min averages description of surroundings of each of the measurement stations are given in appendix a 2 4 wind field modelling we estimated local wind fields around the two lakes using a spatial temporal model based on wind data observed at the local stations fig 1 this chapter outlines the modelling methodology and shows some results the details of the modelling are described in appendix b in this study we combined two methodologies time series analysis and spatial analysis interpolation in specific auto regressive ar models and kriging are used for the time series analysis and spatial interpolation respectively the modelling procedure in this study is shown in fig 2 as a flowchart first basic statistical data analysis is carried out to investigate the stochastic characteristics such as stationarity and auto cross correlations of the wind directions and speeds second an appropriate temporal model is selected based on the results of the statistical analysis we selected one dimensional auto regressive ar models as the temporal models third the model parameters are estimated using a optimization method in this study we estimated the ar coefficients using direct monte carlo method with 100 000 samples finally spatially sparse wind data at each time step are statistically interpolated by the kriging this spatial temporal model can estimate wind direction and speed at any location and any time step with low computational cost appendix b fig b5 hereafter the obtained model is referred to as s t model 2 5 hydrodynamic modelling 2 5 1 lake circulation model we used version 2 9 of the coherens model luyten 2013 as our 3d hydrodynamic model to provide the physics related to advection diffusion coherens is an ocean circulation model that solves navier stokes equations using the boussinesq approximation and the assumption of vertical hydrostatic equilibrium the primitive equations are solved in a horizontally uniform rectangular grid with the resolution of 50 m for both of the horizontal directions 76 and 85 grid cells in west east and south north directions respectively and with 10 σ layers directions east to west and south to north are hereafter referred as x and y directions the water column is always divided into 10 layers at regular intervals for each lake grid point i the model runs were started from rest i e initial values of 0 were used for currents and concentrations and 5 c for temperature continuous release was started immediately but accidental releases after 177 h of running the model in the model we consider the four biggest inflows and outflows of the lakes surface height was used as a boundary condition for river pappilanjoki and discharges for river tourujoki brook syväoja as well as for the intake of potable water for brook syväoja we generated the daily discharge values based on a statistical model that utilized rainfall data obtained from fmi open data service and our own discharge measurements performed in open water period in the year 2016 we implemented a simple transport module to version 2 9 of coherens based on coherens version 1 luyten et al 1999 we set the model up to follow the dispersion of a imaginary tracer from three different sources 1 an accident on the bridge over river löylyjoki 2 a leakage from a sewage pipe installed on the bottom of lake palokkajärvi 3 and an accident on the narrow ridge between lakes on the european route 75 fig 1 in scenarios 1 3 the imaginary tracer release is instantaneous duration of the release is half an hour and the amount of material approximately corresponds to the carrying capacity of semi truck and is 30 m3 with an arbitrary concentration of 1 unit l for sites 1 and 3 the imaginary tracer is discharged to the surface and for site 2 to the bottom we consider concentrations in several observation points located in both lakes and also in the middle of river löylyjoki see fig 1 in lake tuomiojärvi the observation locations are the water intake pipe mouth of waterworks and the narrow passage between northern and southern basins for lake palokkajärvi those observation locations are at the mouths of the rivers pappilanjoki and tourujoki 3 results in this chapter we discuss the effects of temporal accuracy of wind forcing to the lake model as well as compare three wind forcing options representing different aspects of local wind fields two of them are direct measurement values lehtisaari and kaijala see fig 1 and the third one is the wind field obtained using the spatio temporal modelling discussed in chapter wind field modelling the obtained results are compared to corresponding wind data at the tikkakoski airport 3 1 effect of different wind forcing to currents in general the simulated currents follow the y component of the measured current more closely than the x component fig 3 and appendix d this is due to the fact that this direction is almost in the direction of the main flow we found that none of the wind forcing options was clearly better than other when comparing the simulation results to the observed currents different wind forcing catches different features in different times and misses others furthermore goodness of fit measures are dependent of the model grid location chosen to correspond the current measurement location moving one vertical or horizontal step from a selected point affects to the goodness of fit measures and also the visual correspondence between simulation results and measurement if we consider obtained time series as probability distributions or histograms we observe that there are no big differences between magnitudes of simulated currents although there is bigger deviation in the direction fig 4 again choosing a different grid location to represent measurement location affects the correspondence between measurement and simulation results however the best statistical correspondence leads to poorer visual correspondence between the time series root mean square error values compared to flow fields from lake simulation performed using tikkakoski wind data are presented for all lake model lattice points and same sigma layer for simulations using wind data from the a s t model and b kaijala fig 5 in both comparisons similar spatial locations are highlighted flow fields from simulation performed using s t model wind deviate more from simulation using tikkakoski wind data than is the case when using kaijala wind fields this can be seen from fig 5a and b and more directly from fig 5c the magnitude of the deviation is related to the depth of the comparison point since in a spatially homogenous sigma layer system the thickness of a layer depends on depth for shallower points the layer thickness is lower and wind forcing causes higher surface flow speeds although the main flow direction through river löylyjoki is usually from lake tuomiojärvi to lake palokkajärvi it is quite common that the direction of flow changes now and then see fig 6 roughly estimated the change of flow direction back flow can occur at high water with suitable wind the duration of back flow situations are usually short see fig 7 it is even possible for the flow direction to change within the time it takes to make a single discharge measurement of river löylyjoki using a hand held measurement device it is expected that different wind forcing also has an effect on the timing and duration of back flow events this can be seen from figs 6 and 7 with s t model wind forcing the back flow event is ongoing simultaneously with the releases of the imaginary tracers in addition the duration of back flow events is shortest for s t model wind forcing there are subtle timing differences of back flow events throughout the study period when using s t model wind forcing the timing differences are small furthermore there is also a clear threshold value about 1 h for forcing frequency after which the shape of the probability distribution changes for low frequency longer time between forcing data short backflow events occur at a smaller probability when compared to the higher frequencies for low frequencies also longer backflow events are more probable than for higher frequencies 3 2 effect of wind forcing to dispersion although different wind forcing data has noticeable differences to the timings and durations of the backflow events it does not necessary guarantee that these deviations would be enough to create big effects when considered the dispersion of imaginary tracers to the lake system this is caused due to the fact that a long lasting back flow event does not automatically mean a larger volume of water actually transported backwards 3 2 1 instantaneous sources 3 2 1 1 arrival times of the plume for different wind forcing the arrival of the concentration plume of an imaginary tracer released from three different locations has been calculated for different wind forcing frequencies local measured wind observations kaijala and lehtisaari and for the s t model that uses all available measured wind data the cases using different wind forcing frequencies are later referred to temporal cases and the cases using local wind data and s t model data to spatial arrival times are presented again for 5 different locations that are same than in the arrival time inspection within the selected observation locations see fig 1 the water intake location is the most interesting based on simulations the imaginary plume would arrive in the shortest time when using the s t model wind from location 1 10 5 h see figs 1 and 11 using other spatial forcing the plume arrives much later from location 1 kaijala 219 8 h and lehtisaari 157 3 h by high updating rate of wind forcing arrival times of plume are about 30 h while for low updating rate they are between 171 8 and 173 3 h from location 3 plumes arrives simultaneously by kaijala and s t model wind 158 5 h and much later by kaijala winds 220 h regardless of the updating rate of tikkakoski wind data the plumes arrive about 172 h these arrival times are same or later when using low updating rate of wind forcing for high updating rate of wind forcing arrival times of imaginary tracer are about 30 h from location 1 but for location 2 arrival times are same regardless the frequency release from location 2 although being closest to release location 1 arrives fastest by the tikkakoski forcing if applied with frequencies greater than the threshold value between 15 and 60 min fig 8 information shown in fig 5 and 6b helps understand why this happens the traveling time from location 2 to the river takes such a long time that the plume misses the first backflow event of the s t model and the first backflow event of tikkakoski forcing is earlier than the second backflow event of s t model forcing hence the plume arrives faster to river löylyjoki and water intake observation point from release location 2 behavior of arrival times of the observation locations located at lake tuomiojärvi can be mostly explained by dynamics of river löylyjoki from time to time effects of the local dynamics of the lake tuomiojärvi are so big that river löylyjoki changes flow direction when the observation location is at either the mouth of river tourujoki or river pappilanjoki there are no big differences between arrival times between wind forcing used but the arrival time of the plume from location 3 to mouth of river pappilanjoki is smaller than from others release locations 3 2 1 2 effect of wind forcing to concentration time series the peaks in concentration time series observed at the water intake location presented in fig 9 are caused by short pulses i e back flow events coming through river löylyjoki since there are no other sources within lake tuomiojärvi the concentration is decreasing between backward pulses of the current due the outflow from river löylyjoki and dispersion within the lake the biggest clearly visible differences between time series are the timing of peaks and their magnitude or entire lack of peaks based on time series presented in fig 9a it is clear that the timing of back flow of river löylyjoki and release of harmful substances from place 1 bridge over river löylyjoki are almost identical since the front plume reaches the water intake locations much more rapidly than by other wind forcing in addition the amount of imaginary tracer coming in this first occasion is so high that other back flow induced plumes cannot be resolved from the higher background concentration although the water intake location is the closest observation point to the release locations not all concentration bursts caused by back flow events are visible because depending on the local wind the burst can move to a direction different from the water intake location depending of the length of this journey the burst will disperse and it might not be visible at all in water intake location thus the concentration peaks in fig 9 do not reflect perfectly the back flow events timing presented in fig 6 for river löylyjoki observation location the concentrations vary in a range 10 8 10 6 not shown values close to 10 8 can be associated to a flow coming from lake tuomiojärvi and higher values for a flow coming from lake palokkajärvi based on the concentration time series it is difficult to determine any systematic deviations between the wind forcing data applied spatial differences between concentration fields are clear fig 10 3 2 2 continuous source continuous release from river pappilanjoki behaves quite similarly when compared to instantaneous releases considered above in chapter 3 2 1 fig 11 in observation locations on lake tuomiojärvi and river tourujoki there are less shifting between wind forcing that produce the highest concentration fig 11a d and e in other observation places the shifting is frequent especially in river pappilanjoki fig 11c this is expected since the observation point is near the source although incoming concentration and water height boundary conditions were the same for all simulated wind forcing scenarios the amount of imaginary tracer mass coming into the lake can change between simulations this is due the fact that water level boundary condition follows given water height and flow direction and speed can change to fulfill this restriction also changing the amount of incoming imaginary tracer this partially explains why the wind scenario causing the highest concentration values fluctuates as much as it does wind effect on concentration at different parts of lake tuomiojärvi is quite similar fig 11a water intake and 11e narrow passage at lake tuomiojärvi the levels are generally smaller because tracer released to lake palokkajärvi can only be transported to lake tuomiojärvi during backflow events through river löylyjoki as lake tuomiojärvi and lake palokkajärvi are in a delicate balance fig 11b we can see wind forcing scenario specific differences in water exchange and concentrations the fluctuation is combined to timings of backflow events caused by frequent changes of wind relevant question is how much of the loading and in what concentration can be transported to a critical area of interest e g a water intake or a recreational area one way to formulate the relative concentration difference caused by different wind forcing scenarios is by the equation s x concentration b y x w i n d d a t a concentration b y t i k k a k o s k i w i n d d a t a 1 100 where sx is relative concentration difference x refers to kaijala lehtisaari or s t model wind data fig 11 naturally the meaningfulness of the concentration differences strongly depends on the substances considered and therefore it cannot be said in general which deviation is too small or big to matter since at the beginning of the simulation the lakes are at zero concentration there are huge fluctuations in relative concentration differences before the imaginary tracer disperses to the whole lake system fig 12 for those locations that are located far from source this naturally takes more time than for those located closer at the vicinity of the source i e near river pappilanjoki the deviation of s t model simulated concentration values compared to tikkakoski data driven simulation can be as high as 200 from time to time fig 12a i e three times higher between those extremes difference at the negative side of zero but it fluctuates constantly to positive side see fig 13 for other wind scenarios the differences are small and the fluctuations occur symmetrically around zero generally the greater fluctuations are at observation points located on the western shoreline magnitude of the fluctuation decreases as a function of distance to the observation location as expected in the vicinity of river löylyjoki the analysis becomes more difficult since the water exchange between the two lakes increases the fluctuations here the s t model data causes the largest deviations compared to tikkakoski wind forcing data since the s t model data is derived from observation data measured on site kaijala and lehtisaari included the deviations are expected to be caused by s t model s spatial variability 4 discussion our results from a typical nordic lake confirm the earlier results of the importance of local wind field venäläinen et al 2003 the widely used approach using the synoptic wind data from a nearby airport may lead to significant biases especially in wind direction data the wind field over the lakes was very heterogeneous in this study as well as in case for lakes längelmävesi and roine venäläinen et al 2003 the surrounding terrain in our case had altitude variations up to 110 m whereas in the case of lakes längelmävesi and roine by venäläinen et al 2003 the altitude difference between the lake and highest hill top in the surroundings was only half of that in that case wind station situated on the middle of the pelagic zone of the lake we found that in addition to variations in lake flow fields induced by winds blowing from different directions the different wind forcing had also a noticeable effect on timing and duration of back flow events in river löylyjoki as well as the shape and travel time of the imaginary tracer plume within the lakes measured and modelled timings of back flow events are not necessarily matched by increasing the frequency of wind forcing since surface stress and heat exchange processes are based on 10 min average wind large and pond 1981 it is not straightforward to determine which of the wind forcing used in the model gives the most realistic flow field especially when limited number of measurement devices is used to obtain calibration data this is especially true when comparing spatially different wind forcing data sets that all use the same temporal resolution all the local wind fields produced slightly different flow fields which was obvious also from the dispersion of an imaginary tracer there was one modelled situation where the imaginary tracer concentration at a certain observation point differed more than 20 between different wind forcing when studying tracer dispersion computationally it might not be enough to use only average scenarios but also quantify the risk of rapid tracer transport to vulnerable locations in the study area however small deviations in concentration can be also important when considering long term exposure to harmful substances and bioaccumulation to aquatic fauna short term spreading in various forcing scenarios as well as long term effects of concentrations should therefore be considered in risk analyses delivered to e g decision makers one approach to quantify model uncertainty is to use an ensemble modelling approach stott and forest 2007 it is well known that different models do not always produce the same result with the same input data despite the fact that they are all sound i e every choice that has been made can be justified by scientific arguments pearson et al 2006 best guess for future is usually the mean makridakis and winkler 1983 or median behavior of the models and the limits of possible outcomes are derived from results which deviate most from the median ensemble modelling is a wide term and short summary of its variability is given by araujo and new 2007 and it can be used even in situations where outcomes from various models are used as inputs to another models gain et al 2011 for instantaneous release of tracer i e accident scenario the concentration differences between model runs using different local wind fields are closely connected to the dynamics of the connected lakes that is the short term timing of events determines how the tracer will disperse for continuous release also the long term or averaged behavior of the system becomes important when using one of the local wind field variations as atmospheric forcing in lake flow simulations the one obtained by spatio temporal modelling s t model caused the largest deviations compared to the simulations using tikkakoski wind data in most cases this is somewhat surprising since it is derived from local wind data of both kaijala and lehtisaari and results from simulations using kaijala or lehtisaari wind data separately largely follow results from simulations using tikkakoski wind data one reason for this is that there is spatial variability in the s t model that is missing from the others the spatial resolution 50 m 50 m of the s t model coincides with the lake model resolution which can cause larger variations in the surface stress between the model grid points the wind data is usually much coarser spatially in most case studies using coherens or other ocean models to calculate the hydrodynamic transports wind forcing has notable effects on the current fields and dispersion of tracers choosing the best wind forcing is however problematic since calibration of 3 d circulation model to current measurements is problematic when average flow velocities fluctuate around zero one complication is deciding the criteria on how to choose the model parametrizations including applying forcing data to produce the closest correspondence between observations and model results some of the goodness of fit measures are well known such as rmse and concordance correlation and others have been tailored to suit this particular study case appendix d table d1 before using any coefficient to measure the goodness of fit it is vital know the process leading to the observed time series taking into account the differences in forcing data grid size and measurement device specifications the obtained simulated currents are qualitatively sufficient for this study 5 conclusions effects of different wind forcing data to the modelled dynamics of the lake and dispersion of instantaneous and continuous release was studied on the connected lakes tuomiojärvi and palokkajärvi the different wind forcings had a notable effect on the lake flow fields and also had a clear effect on the dispersion of imaginary tracers within a lake system we also found that the applied wind forcing scenarios introduced differences on the dynamics of river löylyjoki connecting our study lakes this river controls the amount of imaginary tracer entering to lake tuomiojärvi none of the methods to obtain local wind forcing for the model was found clearly superior to the others obtaining a reliable description of a wind field on the lakes is made significantly more complicated by the convoluted shorelines simultaneous use of multiple local wind assessment methods in estimating the dispersion of tracer transport could give a sound basis for risk assessment for example in order to guarantee municipal water safety it is of vital importance to know how quickly an accidental release of substances could be transported to the surface water intake we also found that care must be taken when comparing modelled flow field results to measurement data obtained with a relatively inaccurate current meter in limited number of locations the analysis of flow data versus model results proved to be inconclusive therefore in the future a spatially extended measuring campaign with devices more suited to lake environment is required furthermore more studies are needed to determine the relationship and required spatial accuracy of both wind forcing data and the 3 d hydrodynamic lake model declaration of competing interest the authors declare the following financial interests personal relationships which may be considered as

appendix b spatial temporal modelling of local wind fields stochastic characteristics of time series data as the first step of the spatial temporal modelling of wind speed and direction we developed a one dimensional temporal model based on the observed wind data at each station and a time series analysis fig 2 fig b1 shows the time series data of wind speed and direction observed at viitaniemi station from 1st august to 30th september 2015 the horizontal axis indicates time step which means 15 min step we studied stochastic characteristics auto correlation function acf and cross correlation function ccf of the time series data the sample acf c k and sample ccf c k i j are defined as b1 c k 1 n n k 1 n y n μ y n k μ b2 c k i j 1 n n k 1 n y n i μ i y n k j μ j where n is the number of data k is lag and yn is observation data at n th step in this study yn i and yn j indicate wind direction and wind speed respectively sample mean μ is is defined as b3 μ 1 n n 1 n y n although the curves of the computed sample acf have periodic components both of the acf of wind speed and direction decrease with increasing lag and converge into zero fig b2 these trends are often seen as time series data following stationary process therefore we assumed that the time series data follow stationary process and employed auto regressive models ar model for temporal modelling although the curves of sample ccf between the wind direction and speed have small periodic components the correlation coefficients are less than 0 25 see fig b3 therefore the correlation between wind direction and speed is relatively low this fact means that we can treat wind speed and direction independently and make one dimensional ar models for each observation data time series modelling e g kitagawa 2010 based on the results of the acf and the ccf we made a one dimensional ar model for each observation data as time series data are given n th data yn can be estimated by the ar model which is defined as

order to fit the ar model to the data the order m and ar coefficients need to be estimated these parameters are noted as θ μ a 1 a m for simplicity in this study we set m 21 and determined the best ar

spatial interpolation for the one dimensional time series data generated by the ar model the kriging is a method for spatial interpolation for data at given points by calculate a weighted mean of the

wind fields by combining the ar model and the ordinary kriging spatial temporal modelling of local wind fields can be achieved although the proposed method provides wind fields near the surface of the lakes wind speed changes with altitude i e wind speed increases with increasing altitude in order to consider the effect of altitude the wind profile power law robeson and shein 1997 was applied to the estimated wind speed the power law is defined as b9 u u ref z z ref α where u is wind speed at height z u ref is known wind speed at known altitude z ref and α is an empirically derived coefficient that is dependent upon the stability of the atmosphere and is usually set as 0 143 the u ref and z ref are estimated by the proposed spatial temporal modelling appendix c modelling daily discharges of brook syväoja we conducted discharge measurement of brook syväoja approximately weekly in open water period in the year 2016 based on this discharge data and precipitation data available we obtained equation describing the discharges this estimation of brook syväoja discharge is obtained by finding such amount of accumulated water that minimizes the total deviation from observations i e we conducted least square fittings for various amounts of accumulated water to find the value that minimizes the difference fig c1 the best fit was gained by using accumulated rainfall during previous 17 5 days of a discharge measurement estimated discharge values describe well the observations fig c2 appendix d see table d1
