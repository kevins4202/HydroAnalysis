24955,despite the prevalence of high order interactions hois in pollination herbivory metacommunities few studies have yet explored the dynamical implications of such high order interacting effects on the metacommunity persistence in a spatial context here we develop a spatially implicit patch dynamic framework for a simple three species system with one pollinator and one herbivore sharing one plant species in order to check whether and how the hois induced by the herbivore modify system robustness to habitat loss we find that high order interacting effects are a complex function of demographic characteristics habitat loss and top down control interestingly hois do not affect species extinction thresholds though they can mediate species abundances depending on habitat loss and top down control furthermore habitat loss initiates a bottom up cascade of species extinction regardless of hois the herbivore shows most susceptible to habitat loss while both mutualists suffer the abrupt extinction at the same threshold because of their interdependence finally we observe that both mutualists surprisingly display diverse including negative positive or neutral responses to an increase in feeding pressure but the herbivore shows a monotonic decline in population abundance overall we provide an important theoretical framework to explore the effect of hois on metacommunity robustness of the pollination herbivory interactions to habitat loss at a regional scale keywords high order interactions habitat loss herbivory patch dynamics pollination 1 introduction both pollination and herbivory are the most important interactions between plants and animals in natural communities and numerous studies have already explored their community stability for decades fortuna and bascompte 2006 lewinsohn et al 2006 bastolla et al 2009 thébault and fontaine 2010 tylianakis and morris 2017 most of these studies focused on the structural dynamics of bipartite networks with either mutualistic e g pollination or antagonistic e g herbivory networks and found that the network architecture favoring stability fundamentally differs between antagonistic and mutualistic interactions thébault and fontaine 2010 despite the remarkable advances these studies that consider mutualistic and antagonistic interactions separately overlook the potential important influence of high order interactions hois one species modulating the direct interaction between two others wootton 1994 goudard and loreau 2008 occurring between them sauve et al 2014 2016a fontaine et al 2011 kefi et al 2012 in nature almost all species can be involved in both mutualistic and antagonistic interactions simultaneously and mounting evidence confirms that both types of interaction are not independent from each other e g herbivory affects pollination so called hois strauss et al 1996 strauss 1997 krupnick et al 1999 lehtila and strauss 1999 adler et al 2001 2006 theis 2006 kessler and halitschke 2009 danderson and molano flores 2010 as observed herbivory can result in divergent consequences for pollination review in lucas barbosa 2016 evidence of herbivory reducing pollination in nature abounds e g by altering floral display strauss 1997 by activating chemical defenses of plants adler et al 2006 and by decreasing availability and quality of rewards for pollinators strauss 1997 lehtila and strauss 1999 adler et al 2006 examples of herbivory facilitating pollination are less common but do occur for instance root herbivory increased visits by pollinators to flowers of the mustard sinapis arvensis poveda et al 2003 2005 in addition plant secondary metabolites in floral rewards induced by herbivores can serve as antibiotics for pollinators thereby enhancing pollination and optimizing plant reproduction richardson and bond 2015 despite the prevalence of hois in a pollination herbivory community they are often excluded from models combining both mutualistic and antagonistic interactions georgelin and loeuille 2014 mougi and kondoh 2014 sauve et al 2016b in fact most of previous work just examined species coexistence under pairwise direct mutualistic or antagonistic interactions separately even though both interactions are simply bonded sauve et al 2014 in addition studies of ignoring hois may be insufficient for understanding the evolution of interactions in general and the coevolutionary process in particular as they cannot capture the full community complexity thus we still lack clear expectations of how such hois should affect species coexistence and therefore the persistence of the pollination herbivory interactions as a whole studies exploring the role of spatial context are also key to understanding how hois operate across the pollination herbivory metacommunities mayfield and stouffer 2017 yet very few have investigated the dynamical implications of such high order interacting effects on the metacommunity persistence in a spatial context over the past three decades metacommunity theory has become increasingly prevalent in examining the effect of habitat destruction on species extinction in antagonistic and or mutualistic interactions and great advances have been achieved in general understanding of the negative consequences of habitat loss for biodiversity e g nee and may 1992 tilman et al 1994 1997 klausmeier 2001 fortuna and bascompte 2006 pillai et al 2010 2011 liao et al 2016 2017a b c by using metacommunity approach we thus develop a spatially implicit patch dynamic mean field framework for a simple three species module with a consumer and a mutualist sharing a plant species fig 1 so as to focus on the role of hois for the response of the pollination herbivory interaction to habitat loss since this module is a small system whose high order effects are easier to study and understand it can help identify the mechanisms on which complex network dynamics rely avoiding confusion by the complexity of ecological networks 2 methods 2 1 model description we first consider a landscape of an infinite number of well mixed size equal patches with two habitat types suitable habitat s patches which can be colonized by species and unsuitable habitat u patches which is unsuitable for any species establishment illustrated in fig 1 as all s patches have the same size it is justified to assume that they can support the equal maximum population for a given species thus the number of s patches occupied by a species patch occupancy can be considered as a measure of its total populations we use s to represent the proportion of suitable patches in the entire landscape so the level of habitat loss u 1 s i e the fraction of unsuitable patches then we introduce a pollination herbivory community containing three species plant i pollinator j and herbivore k with the mutualist j e g pollination and the consumer k e g eating plant leaves flowers and seeds etc sharing the same plant i see fig 1a given that the mutualistic or antagonistic interaction occurs only when both species i and j or i and k are present at the same patch in addition we assume that species j cannot survive in a patch without the plant i while the plant i is able to survive but cannot reproduce without the pollinator j fig 1b likewise species k cannot survive without the plant i in a local patch but the plant i can persist in the absence of species k when species i j and k are all present in a local patch hois induced by the herbivore occur which are assumed to modulate the mutualistic interactions by affecting plant population fitness based on traditional mean field metacommunity models fortuna and bascompte 2006 liao et al 2016 2017a b c xu et al 2018 we thus can derive the patch dynamics for a pollination herbivory interaction in landscapes subject to habitat loss 1 d ρ i d t c i ρ j 1 θ i j k ρ k ρ i 1 u ρ i c o l o n i z a t i o n e i ρ i μ k ρ k e x t i n c t i o n 2 d ρ j d t c j ρ j ρ i ρ j c o l

patches occupied by species i j and k respectively in the landscape so called global patch occupancy gpo and other parameter interpretations are seen in table 1 each equation listed above consists of two terms colonization and extinction the colonization term encapsulates both reproduction and subsequent establishment of offspring via random dispersal in a local patch the plant i cannot reproduce in a patch without the pollinator j and the pollinator j cannot survive in the absence of the plant i thus ρ j also represents the fraction of patches occupied by both species i and j the colonization term in eq 1 is equal to the colonization rate ci pollinated by species j times the fraction of source patches i e patches occupied by the pollinator and the plant ρ j and times the fraction of empty s patches 1 u ρ i fortuna and bascompte 2006 specifically the hois that species k modulates the pollination between species i and j are assumed to increase with coefficient θ i j k 0 or decrease θ i j

the i patches similarly species j or k can colonize the patches occupied by the plant i but without itself i e ρ i ρ j in eq 2 or ρ i ρ k in eq 3 the extinction term in eqs 1 3 summarizes all forms of density independent mortality experienced by species including intrinsic mortality with rate ei ej and ek and increased extinction of the plant i when over consumed by the herbivore k so called top down control μ k ρ k in eq 1 the death of the plant i can be caused by its intrinsic extinction e i ρ i as well as increased extinction due to over predation by the herbivore k μ k ρ k with ρ k being the fraction of patches occupied by both species i and k while the plant i in a local patch without the herbivore k does not undergo the top down control pillai et al 2010 2011 liao et al 2016 2017a b c since the extinction of the plant from a patch can cause the subsequent extinction of the pollinator and or the herbivore armstrong 1987 fortuna and bascompte 2006 i e species j or k cannot survive in a local patch where the plant i goes extinct due to its intrinsic mortality or top down extinction see eqs 2 3 note that we can obtain the system with no hois by setting θ i j k 0 which can be treated as the reference case so as to scale the effects of hois on system robustness to habitat loss 2 2 model analysis in the pollination herbivory system no species can survive alone because of their interdependence when the herbivore k goes extinct ρ k 0 we obtain the pollination system 4 d p i d t c i p j 1 u p i e i p i 5 d p j d t c j p j p i p j e i e j p j where we give a detailed mathematical analysis for system stability in appendix and find three equilibria a trivial equilibrium 0 0 with local asymptotic stability a locally stable positive equilibrium and another unstable positive equilibrium fig 2 by tracking the stable positive equilibrium we observe that the abundances of both species i and j at equilibrium are decreased with increasing habitat loss fig 2 and they go extinct abruptly at the same threshold defined as the maximum habitat loss that a species can tolerate without going extinct if the pollinator j becomes extinct ρ j 0 then the plant i cannot reproduce see eq 1 and ultimately go extinct as such the herbivore k will go extinct as well as it cannot survive without the basal plant i thus the herbivory system cannot exist alone without pollinators in the pollination herbivory system in which all species i j and k survive we find that it is quite difficult to derive the equilibrium for such complex system because of a very long and messy mathematical expression as such we first make the stability analysis for the equilibrium points via numerical solutions using ode45 matlab r2016a by tracking the dynamical trajectories under various initial species abundances within the effective range ρ i ρ j ρ k 0 1 note that ρ j ρ i a n d ρ k ρ i with a large number of numerical analysis figs s1 s6 in appendix there exist a trivial equilibrium 0 0 0 and a non trivial positive equilibrium fig 3 this positive equilibrium should be feasible as many dynamical trajectories ultimately converge at a positive point i e unaffected by the initial state suggesting that this positive equilibrium might be stable fig s3 in appendix again we track the positive feasible equilibrium by varying the coefficient of hois θ i j k 1 1 top down extinction rate μ k 0 1 and habitat loss u 0 1 fig 3 as expected increasing θ i j k promotes all species abundances at equilibrium in contrast to the case of increasing habitat loss interestingly as top down extinction rate increases i e increasing feeding pressure gpos for both species i and j are decreased initially but later increased whereas the abundance of species k shows a monotonic decline then we further conduct numerical simulations ode45 matlab r2016a to explore whether and how different hois alter the response of the pollination herbivory interaction to habitat loss simulations are run long enough for initial transients to dissipate and reach an equilibrium state a species is assumed to be extinct if gpo falls below 0 00001 a broad range of biologically reasonable parameter combinations are explored and found to yield qualitatively similar outcomes see figs s1 s9 in appendix thereby allowing us to present our outcomes as generalities by choosing one of parameter combinations set in figs 2 6 3 results we first investigate how habitat loss affects species persistence in a pollination herbivory system at equilibrium fig 4 generally an increase of habitat loss reduces gpos for all species irrespective of hois meanwhile the plant species can keep higher population abundance than the pollinator but both species suffer an abrupt extinction at the same threshold yet the herbivore is more vulnerable to habitat loss therefore going extinct soonest when comparing to the reference case with no hois θ i j k 0 we find that positive hois promote species abundances in contrast to negative hois see fig s8 in appendix however as habitat loss increases effects of hois are gradually weakened and ultimately disappear when the herbivore just goes extinct suggesting that hois cannot affect species extinction thresholds furthermore an increase of top down extinction rate μ k lowers gpo for the herbivore monotonically while population abundances for both mutualists display diverse positive neutral or negative responses to top down control depending on both habitat loss and hois e g fig s7 in appendix then we systematically explore the effect of variation in top down control on species persistence again under different hois fig 5 as the top down extinction rate increases gpos for both mutualists initially decrease but then increase up to their occupancy at μk 0 because of the release in top down control i e extinction of the herbivore while the herbivore abundance declines monotonically regardless of hois as expected positive hois can maintain higher species abundances than negative hois yet such high order effects are greatly restricted by both habitat loss and top down control for example effects of hois are weakened with increasing habitat loss because of lower species abundances and therefore species encounter frequency interestingly as top down control increases the effect of hois is initially enhanced but later weakened and ultimately disappears when the herbivore goes extinct we finally analyze the interactive effects of habitat loss and top down control on species coexistence under hois fig 6 both increasing habitat loss and top down control generally speed up species extinction while the herbivore shows most susceptible to both factors both mutualists display the same extinction threshold because of their interdependence again hois do not affect species coexistence pattern fig 6 though they can mediate species abundances to some degree see fig s9 in appendix 4 discussion we develop a patch dynamic framework for a pollination herbivory module in landscapes subject to habitat loss where the plant is assumed to undergo hois induced by the herbivore i e directly affecting plant population fitness at the same time such high order effects can feed back to the pollinator and the herbivore separately via a trophic cascade to some extent this spatially implicit approach for modelling hois is distinct from previous non spatial models e g wootton 1994 goudard and loreau 2008 where nontrophic interactions are introduced by directly adding nontrophic modifications into trophic interactions with the model we find that although hois can mediate species patch occupancy with positive or negative hois promoting or decreasing species abundances they do not affect species extinction thresholds the maximal habitat loss beyond which a species just goes extinct this can be explained from the fact that if a species in the pollination herbivory system approaches extinction ρ i ρ j o r ρ k 0 then the high order effect would disappear as species encounter frequency tends to zero θ i j k ρ j ρ k ρ i 0 in other words the occurrence of hois requires all species plant pollinator and herbivore to be present in a local patch thus hois would be greatly weakened at extremely low levels of species abundances and ultimately the effect of hois would disappear if one or more species go extinct due to increased habitat loss however both habitat loss and top down control determine these high order effects by altering species abundances for example while effects of hois are gradually decreased with increasing habitat loss such effects are initially enlarged but later weakened as top down control increases habitat loss initiates a bottom up cascade of species extinction from plants to both pollinators and herbivores essentially the reduction of plant species abundance resulting from habitat loss can lead to lower pollination rates which in turn decreases plant reproductive success the decline in plant persistence further results in a lower herbivore abundance as the herbivore requires the plant resource for survival interestingly the herbivore displays most susceptible to habitat loss while both mutualists suffer the abrupt extinction as habitat loss increases showing the same extinction threshold because of their interdependence i e plant species cannot reproduce without pollinators while pollinators cannot survive without plant resources fortuna and bascompte 2006 xu et al 2018 this outcome may provide some guidance for potential biological control attempts of pest herbivores by properly reducing habitat amount as both mutualists can tolerate much more habitat loss than herbivores as habitat is lost the sudden and unexpected extinction of both mutualists reminds those conservation ecologists that the fact declines are gradual does not mean that an extinction cliff is not just around the corner klausmeier 2001 of course the details of extinction trajectories depend critically on the mechanisms that promote species coexistence in the first place only after we achieve a complete understanding of the mechanisms of biodiversity maintenance will we be able to effectively monitor and manage against species extinction facing habitat loss klausmeier 2001 both mutualists interestingly reveal diverse including positive neutral or negative responses to an increase of the feeding pressure on plant species μ k while the herbivore shows a monotonic decline in population abundance fig 5 as the feeding pressure increases the patch occupancy of both mutualists initially decreases but then increases and finally saturates when the herbivore goes extinct logically at low levels of feeding pressure all species can keep relatively high population abundances and as such the resulting increased top down control μ k ρ k because of increasing feeding pressure can reduce plant abundance which further decreases the patch occupancy of the pollinator and the herbivore via a trophic cascade yet when further increasing the feeding pressure the rapid decline in patch occupancy of the herbivore would in turn promote the abundances of both mutualists due to the decreased top down control μ k ρ k ultimately as the extinction of the herbivore ρ k 0 leads to the release in top down control effects of top down control would disappear thereby restoring the pollination efficiency fig 5 consequently increasing feeding pressure on plant species results in variation in top down control and therefore diverse responses of both mutualists yet such top down effects are greatly restricted by habitat loss fig 5 in our model we do not consider the hois induced by the pollinator in nature pollination may also increase or decrease herbivory e g several floral traits involved in pollination have been shown to attract herbivores strauss et al 2002 adler and bronstein 2004 theis 2006 while some ant pollinators can protect plants against herbivores buckley 1983 beattie et al 1985 another particular example is that a few wasp pollinators can parasitize pest insects and hence suppress the herbivory between plants and insects machado et al 2005 besides the plant biochemical defenses induced by the herbivore is also ignored in our model mothershead and marquis 2000 adler et al 2001 2006 gómez 2008 kessler et al 2008 knauer and schiestl 2017 thus future study could integrate the pollinator induced hois as well as the chemical defense mechanism into our theoretical framework so as to achieve a deeper understanding of the pollination herbivory system stability this study presents a patch occupancy model for a pollinator plant herbivore module in fragmented landscapes by involving hois in this simple system we find that species interacting in a high order way can affect species abundances depending on both habitat loss and top down control yet such hois do not affect species extinction thresholds to empirically evaluate the effects of hois first we can use observations of pairwise mutualistic and antagonistic interactions separately and then parameters characterizing these direct interactions are determined subsequently these parameters are used to predict the dynamics of the full community ultimately the high order interacting effects can be inferred by checking whether the observed results match the predicted results via comparative analysis our theoretical framework can be further extended by integrating network approaches so as to understand and predict how hois

klausmeier 2001 fortuna and bascompte 2006 pillai et al 2010 2011 liao et al 2016 2017a b c by using metacommunity approach we thus develop a spatially implicit patch dynamic mean field framework for a simple three species module with a consumer and a mutualist sharing a plant species fig 1 so as to focus on the role of hois for the response of the pollination herbivory interaction to habitat loss since this module is a small system whose high order effects are easier to study and understand it can help identify the mechanisms on which complex network dynamics rely avoiding confusion by the complexity of ecological networks 2 methods 2 1 model description we first consider a landscape of an infinite number of well mixed size equal patches with two habitat types suitable habitat s patches which can be colonized by species and unsuitable habitat u patches which is unsuitable for any species establishment illustrated in fig 1 as all s patches have the same size it is justified to assume that they can support the equal maximum population for a given species thus the number of s patches occupied by a species patch occupancy can be considered as a measure of its total populations we use s to represent the proportion of suitable patches in the entire landscape so the level of habitat loss u 1 s i e the fraction of unsuitable patches then we introduce a pollination herbivory community containing three species plant i pollinator j and herbivore k with the mutualist j e g pollination and the consumer k e g eating plant leaves flowers and seeds etc sharing the same plant i see fig 1a given that the mutualistic or antagonistic interaction occurs only when both species i and j or i and k are present at the same patch in addition we assume that species j cannot survive in a patch without the plant i while the plant i is able to survive but cannot reproduce without the pollinator j fig 1b likewise species k cannot survive without the plant i in a local patch but the plant i can persist in the absence of species k when species i j and k are all present in a local patch hois induced by the herbivore occur which are assumed to modulate the mutualistic interactions by affecting plant population fitness based on traditional mean field metacommunity models fortuna and bascompte 2006 liao et al 2016 2017a b c xu et al 2018 we thus can derive the patch dynamics for a pollination

patches occupied by species i j and k respectively in the landscape so called global patch occupancy gpo and other parameter interpretations are seen in table 1 each equation listed above consists of two terms colonization and extinction the colonization term encapsulates both reproduction and subsequent establishment of offspring via random dispersal in a local patch the plant i cannot reproduce in a patch without the pollinator j and the pollinator j cannot survive in the absence of the plant i thus ρ j also represents the fraction of patches occupied by both species i and j the colonization term in eq 1 is equal to the colonization rate ci pollinated by species j times the fraction of source patches i e patches occupied by the pollinator and the plant ρ j and times the fraction of empty

density independent mortality experienced by species including intrinsic mortality with rate ei ej and ek and increased extinction of the plant i when over consumed by the herbivore k so called top down control μ k ρ k in eq 1 the death of the plant i can be caused by its intrinsic extinction e i ρ i as well as increased extinction due to over predation by the herbivore k μ k ρ k with ρ k being the fraction of patches occupied by both species i and k while the plant i in a local patch without the herbivore k does not undergo the top down control pillai et al 2010 2011 liao et al 2016 2017a b c since the extinction of the plant from a patch can cause the subsequent extinction of the pollinator and or the herbivore armstrong 1987 fortuna and bascompte 2006 i e species j or k cannot survive in a local patch where the plant i goes extinct due to its intrinsic mortality or top down extinction see eqs 2 3 note that we can obtain the system with no hois by setting θ i j k 0 which can be treated as the reference case so as to scale the effects of hois on system robustness to habitat loss 2 2 model analysis in the pollination herbivory system no species can survive alone because of their interdependence when the herbivore k goes extinct ρ k 0 we obtain the pollination system 4 d p i d t c i p j 1 u p i e i p i 5 d p j d t c j p j p i p j e i e j p j where we give a detailed mathematical analysis for system stability in appendix and find three equilibria a trivial equilibrium 0 0 with local asymptotic stability a locally stable positive equilibrium and another unstable positive equilibrium fig 2 by tracking the stable positive equilibrium we observe that the abundances of both species i and j at equilibrium are decreased with increasing habitat loss fig 2 and they go extinct abruptly at the same threshold defined as the maximum habitat loss that a species can tolerate without going extinct if the pollinator j becomes extinct ρ j 0 then the plant i cannot reproduce see eq 1 and ultimately go extinct as such the herbivore k will go extinct as well as it cannot survive without the basal plant i thus the herbivory system cannot exist alone without pollinators in the pollination herbivory system in which all species i j and k survive we find that it is quite difficult to derive the equilibrium for such complex system because of a very long and messy mathematical expression as such we first make the stability analysis for the equilibrium points via numerical solutions using ode45 matlab r2016a by tracking the dynamical trajectories under various initial species abundances within the effective range ρ i ρ j ρ k 0 1 note that ρ j ρ i a n d ρ k ρ i with a large number of numerical analysis figs s1 s6 in appendix there exist a trivial equilibrium 0 0 0 and a non trivial positive equilibrium fig 3 this positive equilibrium should be feasible as many dynamical trajectories ultimately converge at a positive point i e unaffected by the initial state suggesting that this positive equilibrium might be stable fig s3 in appendix again we track the positive feasible equilibrium by varying the coefficient of hois θ i j k 1 1 top down extinction rate μ k 0 1 and habitat loss u 0 1 fig 3 as expected increasing θ i j k promotes all species abundances at equilibrium in contrast to the case of increasing habitat loss interestingly as top down extinction rate increases i e increasing feeding pressure gpos for both species i and j are decreased initially but later increased whereas the abundance of species k shows a monotonic decline then we further conduct numerical simulations ode45 matlab r2016a to explore whether and how different hois alter the response of the pollination herbivory interaction to habitat loss simulations are run long enough for initial transients to dissipate and reach an equilibrium state a species is assumed to be extinct if gpo falls below 0 00001 a broad range of biologically reasonable parameter combinations are explored and found to yield qualitatively similar outcomes see figs s1 s9 in appendix thereby allowing us to present our outcomes as generalities by choosing one of parameter combinations set in figs 2 6 3 results we first investigate how habitat loss affects species persistence in a pollination herbivory system at equilibrium fig 4 generally an increase of habitat loss reduces gpos for all species irrespective of hois meanwhile the plant species can keep higher population abundance than the pollinator but both species suffer an abrupt extinction at the same threshold yet the herbivore is more vulnerable to habitat loss therefore going extinct soonest when comparing to the reference case with no hois θ i j k 0 we find that positive hois promote species abundances in contrast to negative hois see fig s8 in appendix however as habitat loss increases effects of hois are gradually weakened and ultimately disappear when the herbivore just goes extinct suggesting that hois cannot affect species extinction thresholds furthermore an increase of top down extinction rate μ k lowers gpo for the herbivore monotonically while population abundances for both mutualists display diverse positive neutral or negative responses to top down control depending on both habitat loss and hois e g fig s7 in appendix then we systematically explore the effect of variation in top down control on species persistence again under different hois fig 5 as the top down extinction rate increases gpos for both mutualists initially decrease but then increase up to their occupancy at μk 0 because of the release in top down control i e extinction of the herbivore while the herbivore abundance declines monotonically regardless of hois as expected positive hois can maintain higher species abundances than negative hois yet such high order effects are greatly restricted by both habitat loss and top down control for example effects of hois are weakened with increasing habitat loss because of lower species abundances and therefore species encounter frequency interestingly as top down control increases the effect of hois is initially enhanced but later weakened and ultimately disappears when the herbivore goes extinct we finally analyze the interactive effects of habitat loss and top down control on species coexistence under hois fig 6 both increasing habitat loss and top down control generally speed up species extinction while the herbivore shows most susceptible to both factors both mutualists display the same extinction threshold because of their interdependence again hois do not affect species coexistence pattern fig 6 though they can mediate species abundances to some degree see fig s9 in appendix 4 discussion we develop a patch dynamic framework for a pollination herbivory module in landscapes subject to habitat loss where the plant is assumed to undergo hois induced by the herbivore i e directly affecting plant population fitness at the same time such high order effects can feed back to the pollinator and the herbivore separately via a trophic cascade to some extent this spatially implicit approach for modelling hois is distinct from previous non spatial models e g wootton 1994 goudard and loreau 2008 where nontrophic interactions are introduced by directly adding nontrophic modifications into trophic interactions with the model we find that although hois can mediate species patch occupancy with positive or negative hois promoting or decreasing species abundances they do not affect species extinction thresholds the maximal habitat loss beyond which a species just goes extinct this can be explained from the fact that if a species in the pollination herbivory system approaches extinction ρ i ρ j o r ρ k 0 then the high order effect would disappear as species encounter frequency tends to zero θ i j k ρ j ρ k ρ i 0 in other words the occurrence of hois requires all species plant pollinator and herbivore to be present in a local patch thus hois would be greatly weakened at extremely low levels of species abundances and ultimately the effect of hois would disappear if one or more species go extinct due to increased habitat loss however both habitat loss and top down control determine these high order effects by altering species abundances for example while effects of hois are gradually decreased with increasing habitat loss such effects are initially enlarged but later weakened as top down control increases habitat loss initiates a bottom up cascade of species extinction from plants to both pollinators and herbivores essentially the reduction of plant species abundance resulting from habitat loss can lead to lower pollination rates which in turn decreases plant reproductive success the decline in plant persistence further results in a lower herbivore abundance as the herbivore requires the plant resource for survival interestingly the herbivore displays most susceptible to habitat loss while both mutualists suffer the abrupt extinction as habitat loss increases showing the same extinction threshold because of their interdependence i e plant species cannot reproduce without pollinators while pollinators cannot survive without plant resources fortuna and bascompte 2006 xu et al 2018 this outcome may provide some guidance for potential biological control attempts of pest herbivores by properly reducing habitat amount as both mutualists can tolerate much more habitat loss than herbivores as habitat is lost the sudden and unexpected extinction of both mutualists reminds those conservation ecologists that the fact declines are gradual does not mean that an extinction cliff is not just around the corner klausmeier 2001 of course the details of extinction trajectories depend critically on the mechanisms that promote species coexistence in the first place only after we achieve a complete understanding of the mechanisms of biodiversity maintenance will we be able to effectively monitor and manage against species extinction facing habitat loss klausmeier 2001 both mutualists interestingly reveal diverse including positive neutral or negative responses to an increase of the feeding pressure on plant species μ k while the herbivore shows a monotonic decline in population abundance fig 5 as the feeding pressure increases the patch occupancy of both mutualists initially decreases but then increases and finally saturates when the herbivore goes extinct logically at low levels of feeding pressure all species can keep relatively high population abundances and as such the resulting increased top down control μ k ρ k because of increasing feeding pressure can reduce plant abundance which further decreases the patch occupancy of the pollinator and the herbivore via a trophic cascade yet when further increasing the feeding pressure the rapid decline in patch occupancy of the herbivore would in turn promote the abundances of both mutualists due to the decreased top down control μ k ρ k ultimately as the extinction of the herbivore ρ k 0 leads to the release in top down control effects of top down control would disappear thereby restoring the pollination efficiency fig 5 consequently increasing feeding pressure on plant species results in variation in top down control and therefore diverse responses of both mutualists yet such top down effects are greatly restricted by habitat loss fig 5 in our model we do not consider the hois induced by the pollinator in nature pollination may also increase or decrease herbivory e g several floral traits involved in pollination have been shown to attract herbivores strauss et al 2002 adler and bronstein 2004 theis 2006 while some ant pollinators can protect plants against herbivores buckley 1983 beattie et al 1985 another particular example is that a few wasp pollinators can parasitize pest insects and hence suppress the herbivory between plants and insects machado et al 2005 besides the plant biochemical defenses induced by the herbivore is also ignored in our model mothershead and marquis 2000 adler et al 2001 2006 gómez 2008 kessler et al 2008 knauer and schiestl 2017 thus future study could integrate the pollinator induced hois as well as the chemical defense mechanism into our theoretical framework so as to achieve a deeper understanding of the pollination herbivory system stability this study presents a patch occupancy model for a pollinator plant herbivore module in fragmented landscapes by involving hois in this simple system we find that species interacting in a high order way can affect species abundances depending on both habitat loss and top down control yet such hois do not affect species extinction thresholds to empirically evaluate the effects of hois first we can use observations of pairwise mutualistic and antagonistic interactions separately and then parameters characterizing these direct interactions are determined subsequently these parameters are used to predict the dynamics of the full community ultimately the high order interacting effects can be inferred by checking whether the observed results match the predicted results via comparative analysis our theoretical framework can be further extended by integrating network approaches so as to understand and predict how hois

24956,the growth and distribution of plant species in water limited environments is often limited by the atmospheric evaporative demands which is measured in terms of potential evapotranspiration pet while pet estimated by different methods have been widely used to assess vegetation response to climate change species distribution models offer unique opportunity to compare their efficiency in predicting habitat suitability of plant species in this study we perform the first multi species comparison of two widely used metrics of pet i e penman monteith and thornthwaite and show how they result in similar or different on projected distribution of water limited species and potential consequences on their conservation strategies across north central u s to build species distribution models of eight species we used two sets of environmental predictors which were identical except for the metric of pet penman monteith vs thornthwaite and projected habitat suitability for historical 2005 and future 2099 periods we found an excellent model performance with no difference under two sets of predictors auc 0 93 the relative influence of thornthwaite pet on habitat prediction was higher than penman pet for most of the species we observed that the area of the projected suitable habitat was always higher under thornthwaite set of predictors than penman set of predictors ranges from 25 to 941 with the exception of pinus contorta for which the reverse was true in most cases these differences were non trivial indicating that the choice of the pet metric although both of them are commonly used can have dramatic consequences on the conservation management decisions therefore the conservation management decisions can be markedly different depending on the choice of the pet metric used for species distribution modeling of water limited species keywords pet penman monteith thornthwaite habitat suitability conservation 1 introduction species distribution models sdms are widely used tools for projecting distribution of species under climate change and for estimating the relative impact of various predictors of distribution chang et al 2014 guisan and thuiller 2005 mainali et al 2015 piekielek et al 2015 hence sdms may offer an opportunity to compare the relative importance of two different measures of the same underlying phenomenon to date most sdm applications have used one formulation of potential evapotranspiration pet i e thornthwaite for projecting habitat suitability of species under the climate change chang et al 2014 dilts et al 2015 this widely used formulation of pet is based only on temperature a new formulation of pet called penman monteith includes additional metrics for estimating pet as pet estimated by these two metrics differ in a given space it is reasonable to expect that the projected suitable habitat also differs depending on the metric of pet in this study we explore how two common methods of pet estimation can have different impacts on habitat projections and potential consequences on conservation efforts of water limited species across north central u s atmospheric evaporative demand often plays the dominant role in structuring the vegetation communities in water limited environment currie 1991 li et al 2013 this demand called pet has been estimated with several methods such as penman monteith monteith 1965 penman 1948 thornthwaite 1948 priestley and taylor 1972 and turc 1961 as different methods result into different pet values the choice of pet in modeling approaches may result in different ecological interpretations however the common approaches of estimating pet include penman monteith method hereafter penman and thornthwaite method hereafter thornthwaite because thornthwaite pet can be computed with temperature alone it has had wider applications alternatively penman method requires several additional variables viz solar radiation relative humidity vapor pressure deficit and wind speed although it provides a more sophisticated model of pet a reliable estimation of pet with penman has largely been a formidable challenge in past especially at large spatial extents primarily because of lack of available metrics at such spatial extents the latest generation of gcms however provide key elements required to estimate penman pet i e solar radiation vapor pressure deficit and wind speed abatzoglou and brown 2012 stocker et al 2013 taylor et al 2012 making it easier than before to compute the pet comparison of the two metrics of pet has shown considerable variation in space some have found higher penman pet compared to thornthwaite pet and others found the opposite fisher et al 2011 hobbins et al 2008 lu et al 2005 van der schrier et al 2011 a global comparison found that pet estimates by thornthwaite are higher than penman in the tropics and lower in the subtropics van der schrier et al 2011 lower pet values derived from thornthwaite types method compared to penman method have been reported for the usa fisher et al 2011 vörösmarty et al 1998 and sub saharan africa hulme et al 1996 in a recent study adhikari et al 2019 estimated lower thornthwaite pet than penman pet along a strong water balance ecotone across north central u s compared with thornthwaite penman formulation of pet validated reasonably well against field data in regional and global scale studies benli et al 2010 chen et al 2005 lópez urrea et al 2006 tukimat et al 2012 weiß and menzel 2008 the greater reliability of penman pet values is thought to be due to a more sophisticated model of pet with several variables which is expected to estimate the actual physical process more reliably than a simpler thornthwaite model of pet does lu et al 2005 because of their wider use and noticeable differences it is necessary to compare the effects of pet derived from these two methods for ecological and management applications because the two methods are substantially different in estimated pet various indices derived from these pet e g variation in aridity index palmer s drought index and moisture index should also vary considerably between penman and thornthwaite dewes et al 2017 consequently this penman thornthwaite discrepancy can have adverse impacts on strategies plans and processes for climate change adaptation mcafee 2013 therefore the choice of pet must be guided by objective evaluation of the alternate methods that provide an estimate of pet for instance future studies could project the less extreme loss of habitat suitability of water limited species under thornthwaite pet due to less atmospheric evaporative demands under thornthwaite pet past studies have demonstrated considerable difference in habitat predictions resulting from different algorithms spatial resolutions global climate models predictors sample sizes and climate change scenarios acevedo et al 2017 araújo and guisan 2006 bucklin et al 2015 henderson et al 2014 hernandez et al 2006 mainali et al 2015 pearson et al 2006 syphard and franklin 2009 2010 thuiller et al 2004 however model performance and projections of habitat suitability of species mostly influenced by moisture stress under penman vs thornthwaite pet have not been evaluated yet particularly the choice of pet estimated by an appropriate method can be of highly impactful in projecting suitable habitat in water limited environment therefore the choice of pet in sdm of water limited species can influence policy guiding efforts for conservation and management of species under current and future climates in this study we compare the impact of penman and thornthwaite pet in projecting the habitat suitability of eight dominant tree species in water limited forest ecosystems of north central u s specifically we aim to answer the following scientific questions in this study 1 does the performance of models built under the penman pet set of predictors better explain distributions of water limited tree species than those built under thornthwaite pet set the two sets keep identical set of predictors except for pet 2 to what extent does the weighting of environmental predictors differ in models using the penman vs thornthwaite formulation of pet 3 how does projected area of suitable habitat for water limited species under climate change differ under the two metrics of pet 2 methods 2 1 study area and species north central u s is our study region that spans from washington at north west to michigan at north east and from nevada at south west to tennessee at south east the study region is 3 495 769 km2 of the contiguous u s and it includes over twenty five states fig 1 the region is characterized by strong environmental gradients from drier west to high humid east due to gradients in temperature and precipitation the region comprises eight major forest communities with the following dominant tree species doulas fir psuedotsuga menziessi ponderosa pine pinus ponderosa aspen populus sp black spruce picea sp hemlock tsuga sp whitebark pine pinus albicaulis and red maple acer rubrum many forest ecosystems of this region are under various degrees of exposure to the climate change to study the difference in influence of penman pet and thornthwaite pet on habitat modeling we selected eight dominant tree species viz juniperus scopulorum pinus contorta pinus flexilis pinus ponderosa pinus resinosa pinus albicaulis pinus pungens and psuedotsuga menziessi that 1 exist in relatively dry region of north central u s and 2 have their growth and distribution strongly limited by water availability 2 2 distributional data we derived presence and absence records of each species from the u s fia program database http apps fs fed us fiadb downloads datamart html the fia has delineated the forest of our entire study area into a grid of hexagonal cells that are 2500 ha 25 km2 each in each grid cell is one long term sampling plot composed of four adjacent circles of 58 9 ft 18 m radius each a census on the trees is conducted inside these circles this systematic and through sampling across the u s provides a high quality data about tree distribution the absences were drawn from the grid cells that did not contain the species in fia data to reduce the chances of false absences we added a buffer of 5 km around each presence point and excluded any absences falling within this buffer our approach of a identifying areas of absences with thorough sampling and b excluding absent records within 5 km radius of a presence point is expected to provide high quality data for species distribution models because the absent records are more likely to represent an absent state compared to a typical sdm where pseudoabsences are drawn for a regression model like random forest we used two categories of the data represent contrasting states of presence and absence although modelers conveniently use the term pseudoabsences for the background data this collectively indicates that our models are more informed as they operate on environmental space of presences vs true absences the delineation of geographic background for obtaining absences can dramatically impact the model performance and estimated habitat suitability specifically a large background can artificially inflate model evaluation score such as auc and simultaneously give a model that does a poor job of discriminating sites for suitability in the core region of distribution acevedo 2012 therefore we adopted local convex hull approach to determine the geographic background where a model is trained a local convex hull of presences eliminates larger areas within minimum convex polygon without occurrence records thereby shrinking the background for each species we tried a range of local convex hull with different alpha parameters and selected the one that was substantially smaller than minimum convex polygon but included enough areas to contrast grid cells with presences in environmental space because we use a regression model thuiller et al 2016 that builds sdm by contrasting environmental space of presences with that of absences when the absences do not fall in the grid cells with presences we included an equal number of presence and absence records to the model 2 3 historic climate data environmental predictors including monthly average minimum and maximum temperature precipitation pet and relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed for the entire united states at 4 km spatial resolution were derived from multivariate adaptive constructive analogs maca products available predictors in maca data have been derived by a statistical downscaling method and calibrated with observed meteorological dataset i e training dataset from several weather stations to make compatible spatial patterns after correcting historical biases these predictors are available through webpage of university of idaho https climate northwestknowledge net maca abatzoglou and brown 2012 maca data incorporates daily data from general circulation models and validated over western united states by global reanalysis data the advantage of maca data over other downscaled data includes the following 1 maca avoids interpolation based methods with the use of analogs and 2 maca s multivariate approach to improve the physical relationships among the variables abatzoglou and brown 2012 the 4 km spatial resolution data was again statistically downscaled to 1 km spatial resolution available pet estimates in maca product was computed with penman monteith method using solar radiation humidity and wind velocity data a subset of each predictor was created with a shape file of our study area fig 1 monthly average thornthwaite pet was estimated using monthly average temperature from maca products following a method described in chang et al 2014 all the historic climate data were summarized as monthly average for the period of 1980 2006 2 4 non climate predictors in addition to the climatic variables we used aridity index available water holding capacity awhc and sand miller and white 1998 as non climatic predictors to project habitat suitability of species 2 5 collinearity analysis eighty seven predictors were initially considered for each species for constructing sdms for a given species the only predictor that was different between penman and thornthwaite set was the measure of pet penman pet vs thornthwaite pet before the collinearity analysis highly collinear predictors do not uniquely contribute to the model but such a collinearity among predictors can be problematic when assessing significance of individual parameters therefore we eliminated highly correlated predictors of each species from the set using software for assisted habitat modeling sahm embedded in the vistrails scientific workflow management system morisette et al 2013 specifically for each species we eliminated predictors from the set such that the remaining covariates have a pearson s correlation coefficient of 0 70 since this was performed for each species separately the final set of predictors for each species was different however different species do not necessarily have the same collinearity between two predictors this set of predictors was paired with 1 penman pet to create one set of predictors hereafter penman set and with 2 thornthwaite pet to create another set of predictors hereafter thornthwaite set the differences in the habitat suitability estimates with the use of penman set and thornthwaite set would be the unique effect of penman pet and thornthwaite pet when several other predictors are included as predictors 2 6 gcm and future climate data to understand impacts of warming under climate change from 2071 to 2099 we adopted two climate change scenarios with the same set of climate variables projected by general circulation model gcm selected two climate change scenarios include high and low representative concentrative pathway rcp8 5 and rcp4 5 from 2010 to 2099 the rcp 8 5 scenario represents the amount of anthropogenic forcing of 8 5 w m2 consistent with increases in atmospheric greenhouse gases at current rates whereas rcp 4 5 represents anthropogenic forcing of 4 5 w m2 a significant reduction in global greenhouse emissions moss et al 2010 for each of these two emission scenarios the future climates were created by averaging their prediction for the period of 2071 2099 from a warm and dry ccsm4 gcm both historical and future environmental variables are similar but future ones are projected under climate change scenarios the ccsm4 gcm moderately captures overall spread of future projections of temperature and precipitation changes across the study area adhikari and hansen 2019 adhikari et al 2019 2 7 species distribution models to model species distribution we used random forest rf implemented in biomod2 software programmed in r environment thuiller et al 2016 as it is one of the most efficient modeling methods used in species distribution modeling magness et al 2008 mainali et al 2015 often single decision tree or classification and regression tree cart may end up with high variance and high biases contrary to cart the advance extension of rf builds multiple decision trees using subsamples of available input variables this makes the model more stable with better generalization and higher predictive power of independent data breiman 2001 rf has been found in omitting noises in the input variables to improve accuracy and control over fitting matsuki et al 2016 2 8 model development and evaluation since no independent dataset was available the presence absence data of each species was randomly split in a ratio that 80 data have been used for model development calibration and 20 data have been used for model evaluation with 5 fold cross validation dormann et al 2012 the calibration and evaluation selection was run for 100 times before analysis the result the accuracy of the model was assessed from the data generated by the split sample using two metrics area under the curve auc of receiver operator characteristic roc curves and true skill statistic tss these two metrics consider different weights associated with various types of prediction errors of omission commission or confusion widely reported auc metric is both threshold and prevalence independent model evaluation metric fielding and bell 1997 models with the auc value 0 70 is considered as poor 0 7 0 9 as moderate and 0 9 a good model tss is threshold dependent metrics for model evaluation which ranged between 1 no agreement and 1 total agreement landis and koch 1977 we interpreted tss statistics as 0 4 were poor 0 4 0 8 useful and 0 8 good to excellent r script of the analysis is included in supplement 2 9 analysis we compared auc and tss scores secured by the best models created from penman set vs thornthwaite set the study also compared the relative influence of the predictors on habitat predictions of each species under two sets of predictors we categorized probability or habitat suitability into two categories as below suitable greater than 0 50 and unsuitable less than 0 50 we then assessed the ratio of the suitable area predicted by penman set to the thornthwaite set 3 results each species ended up with different numbers of predictors for model trainings after removing autocorrelated predictors fig 2 interestingly the final set of predictors of a species were very similar in the two sets of pet available water holding capacity and soil texture percent sand were common predictors among all species our results showed no difference in performance of the models constructed with the two sets of predictors table 1 overall the models under both sets penman and thornthwaite of predictors secure good to excellent score in prediction with the auc and tss values ranging from 0 93 to 0 98 and 0 71 to 0 85 respectively except that auc was 0 84 0 86 tss was 0 58 0 61under both sets of predictors for p pungens auc is a popular metric of model evaluation when a model needs to be evaluated for both false positive and false negative a situation that is not typical of traditional ecological analysis but definitely a concern in sdm this metric is highly intuitive to modelers therefore it has a wider application in sdm work however studies have shown many times that auc can be unreliable in certain conditions e g lobo et al 2008 mainali et al 2015 to minimize this challenge we employed alpha hull of presences for selecting absences also the design of the study true absences would mean that auc should reflect true underlying model performance which is in contrast to a typical sdm where the background points are used as pseudoabsences this made us confident that auc is the right choice of model evaluation and we stuck to it because scientific community is more comfortable to this metric to add to our analysis we also computed tss score these two model evaluation scores are strongly correlated with r2 0 96 this indicates that the traditionally reported problems with auc are virtually absent in our study therefore we reported the model output of habitat suitability based on widely used auc among the environmental predictors precipitation had highest influence on habitat distribution of all species except p resinosa under penman pet set fig 2 however thornthwaite pet showed highest influence on predicting habitat of all species except p resinosa under thornthwaite set therefore as the most dominant pattern in influential predictors thornthwaite set identifies thornthwaite pet itself as the most influential predictor whereas penman set identifies predictors other than the measure of pet as the most influential predictors under both sets of predictors soil texture sand was the most influential factor for the distribution of p resinosa fig 2 available soil water holding capacity showed some degree of influence on the habitat distribution of p contorta p flexilis p resinosa and p menziesii fig 2 under both set of predictors solar radiation from march to july showed some influence over the distribution of j scopulorum and p menziesii may to september precipitation showed considerable impacts on distribution of j scopulorum p flexilis p ponderosa p albicaulis and p menziesii under both sets of predictors fig 2 january precipitation showed the greatest impacts on distribution of p pungens under both pet interestingly the influence of precipitation on habitat prediction of all species was lower under thornthwaite set than under penman set it is easy to see that this difference is offset by the difference in influence of the metric of pet itself a total of 48 separate maps of habitat suitability fig 3 were generated for 8 species 3 climate scenarios current rcp4 5 rcp8 5 2 sets of predictors penman and thornthwaite the extent of suitable habitat under current climate was predicted higher by thornthwaite set than penman set for five species viz j scopulorum p ponderosa p resinosa p menziesii and p pungens figs 3 5 table 2 all of these species except p resinosa showed a marked decline in suitable habitat in future with the difference between penman and thornthwaite remaining similar as under current climate for two species p albicaulis and p flexilus predicted current habitat was similar under both penman and thornthwaite but they diverge in future showing similar effect as in the other species i e thornthwaite predicting larger extent than penman the only species that exhibited larger extent predicted by penman than thornthwaite under any climate is p contorta the percentage change in habitat of all species in future compared to current prediction are listed in table 3 overall thornthwaite set predicted larger extent of suitable habitat than penman set did for all scenarios current rcp 4 5 rcp 8 5 of all species with two exceptions 1 the prediction was similar for p albicaulis and p flexilis under current climate and 2 the predictions are in reverse direction penman thornthwaite for p contorta under all climate fig 5 4 discussion various metrics of potential evapotranspiration pet have been used in studies related to ecology conservation biogeography climate change etc where the choice of pet metric is apparently driven more by convenience and less by justification given that each metric of pet is specific in its parameters and model structure the measure of pet is metric specific though a thorough comparison of different metrics on species distribution has never been tested projected species distributions have been used in various kinds of management decisions and research questions here we perform the first multi species comparison of two widely used measures of pet and show how they result in similar or different projection of species distribution additional novelties of our study includes the following 1 this is the first ever application of penman monteith estimate of pet in species distribution modeling 2 we downscaled maca variables to a spatial resolution that is ecologically relevant to tree species distribution maca product is special in that it offers many non standard climatic variables for future that are not available from other sources and 3 we applied our model across a continental water balance ecotone where the spatial pattern of water limitation emphasizes the need to represent pet adequately in modeling efforts collectively our study makes a case for future modeling efforts of tree species distributions using a metric of pet that is more appropriate for the studied system and geographical area in this study we compared influenced of pet estimated by two methods on habitat suitability of eight dominant tree species of north central us region which is mostly driven by moisture stress for each species we predicted the habitat suitability with two sets of identical environmental predictors under penman and thornthwaite pet where the only difference is in the metric of pet different species can have different set of predictors this design of keeping all the predictors constant and varying only one predictor of interest pet allows us to directly and quantitatively compare the relative importance of two measures of pet penman vs thornthwaite because the metric of pet is one of the most important predictors of the species distribution in moisture limited environment the estimated importance of the pet as predictor is interpretable as a measure of variable importance that is unique to pet when all the other predictors correlated and uncorrelated to pet are also included in the model because these two metrics are commonly used estimates of pet the discrepancy between the two models in projecting species distribution will have important consequences in conservation and restoration planning their difference in relative influence indicates the unique contribution of the metric in explaining species distribution we show that the distribution of these species is projected substantially differently under penman pet vs thornthwaite pet metrics however the predictive performance of models built with two sets of predictors was similar within a species the accuracy of current modeling method is high showing good to excellent model performance under auc model evaluation metrics and the two sets of predictors do not differ in model performance however the observed dissimilarities in species distribution projections could be due to the impacts of limiting factors on growth and distribution of plant species which are captured differently by the regression models built based on penman set of predictors vs thornthwaite set of predictors e g sandy soil explained higher variability in habitat projection of p resinosa the interpretation of high performance of the models has some important caveats first the model performance metric is relevant only to model training and testing areas the region of model projection can be much larger beyond the geographic space of model construction the evaluation metric is irrelevant and models with very high evaluation metric in the model construction range can yield an unrealistic model for projecting far from the training area mainali et al 2015 second a good fit of model with current distribution does not necessarily indicate the similar performance in the future porfirio et al 2014 the underlying statistical relationship between environmental factors and suitable habitat of the species may change over time these two types of challenges collectively indicate that the spatial first challenge and temporal second one stability of the species distribution models may not be as good as we desire and unfortunately our study can have both types of challenges auc has been criticized as an unreliable metric of model evaluation metric in sdm with valid reasons lobo et al 2008 mainali et al 2015 it is sensitive to geographic background lobo et al 2008 it is entirely possible to secure a very high auc and yield a useless model acevedo 2017 our study design is different from a traditional sdm study and so does not suffer from the same problems reported elsewhere for the following reasons first we do not use pseudoabsences we have real absences collected by a long term systematic data collection effort of large institutions that have well set standards second contrary to a standard sdm that uses a convex hull we shrank the background by using alpha hull third our approach does a fair job in comparing the models because the penman vs thornthwaite set of predictors were supplied with the same set of presence absence data including x fold split of points into training and testing set in such situations even when the absolute value of auc is not reliable the relative difference is an indicator of model fit to data therefore we have confidence in our results based on models evaluated with auc using eight tree species of water limited environment we have demonstrated that uncertainties associated with methodological issues of important variables can affect model outputs substantially this is not a situation of missing out an important predictor rather this is an issue of two different approaches of estimating an important predictor which is pet a sub optimal choice of the model for estimating pet may lead into erroneous planning for conservation and management of targeted species although no past studies explicitly considered the issues on variation in habitat prediction due to difference in pet from two methods our study suggests that the discrepancies in model outputs of different species have been associated with the sets of predictors under penman and thornthwaite pet among eight species considered for this study the model showed that the predicted habitat suitability was higher under thornthwaite set for current and both climate change scenarios than for penman set for all species except p contorta since many past studies reported lower pet values estimated by thornthwaite method adhikari et al 2019 fisher et al 2011 hulme et al 1996 the habitat suitability of water limited species under the influence of thornthwaite pet should be over predicted because of low atmospheric evaporative demands under thornthwaite method this study showed that difference in estimation method of the identical predictors here pet can alter influence of other variables on modeling outputs in this study the unique contribution of precipitation in explaining species distribution is higher under penman set for most of the species for example under the penman set july precipitation was the most important predictor of the habitat of p flexilis p ponderosa and j scopulorum but this was replaced by july pet with the thornthwaite set this may be due to the change in the extent of collinearity between the predictors when multiple methods produce different outputs for the same predictors in addition this variation is contingent upon the species types environmental conditions and geographical locations acevedo et al 2012 syphard and franklin 2009 the contribution of temperature on distribution is lower for all species given that these species grow in water limited environments it is not surprising to see a lesser role of temperature in determining distribution however the impacts of other variables are similar under both sets of predictors showing less importance on distribution of water limited plants 4 1 management and conservation implications the consideration of potential range of a species for conservation and management depends upon the predictive ability of models for habitat suitability and identification of appropriate environmental predictors discrepancies in model predictions due to different sets of environmental predictors can impair the conservation and resource management planning for example it is important to be cautious during formulation of management plans for p resinosa as the model predicted decreases in suitable habitat under penman set and increases under thornthwaite set this species can be categorized as highly vulnerable when habitat is predicted under penman pet set hence the study suggests for a careful consideration of model outputs generated by using appropriate predictors as several other studies have shown that penman estimate of pet is more reliable than thornthwaite lópez urrea et al 2006 weiß and menzel 2008 benli et al 2010 these prior studies can be a guide for selecting appropriate set of predictors even for species for which the future predictions are markedly different between penman vs thornthwaite set 5 conclusion penman and thornthwaite are commonly used measures of pet these two measures are substantially different in model structure and complexity whereas penman is considered to represent pet more accurately than thornthwaite the latter has wider availability in this study we performed a litmus test of how these two metrics of pet perform in predicting species distribution of eight species from moisture stress environment for entire species range thornthwaite predicted higher area than penman in most of the cases climatic scenarios of eight species and the differences are non trivial hence it is important to indicate that 1 the two metrics of pet are substantially different in predicting species range or highly suitable habitat and 2 these differences are not uniform across species i e one or the other metric of pet can predict higher suitable area for different species therefore the conservation management decisions can be markedly different depending on the metric of pet used for sdm it is important to emphasize that the ease of availability should not drive the use of thornthwaite pet neither should the model complexity of penman should make it more desirable whereas a more complex formulation of penman pet might be better able to characterize the actual pet because of its associated several additional variables a careful comparison of the two metrics in a given area and study systems would yield most accurate projection of species distribution author s contribution each author has made significant

24956,the growth and distribution of plant species in water limited environments is often limited by the atmospheric evaporative demands which is measured in terms of potential evapotranspiration pet while pet estimated by different methods have been widely used to assess vegetation response to climate change species distribution models offer unique opportunity to compare their efficiency in predicting habitat suitability of plant species in this study we perform the first multi species comparison of two widely used metrics of pet i e penman monteith and thornthwaite and show how they result in similar or different on projected distribution of water limited species and potential consequences on their conservation strategies across north central u s to build species distribution models of eight species we used two sets of environmental predictors which were identical except for the metric of pet penman monteith vs thornthwaite and projected habitat suitability for historical 2005 and future 2099 periods we found an excellent model performance with no difference under two sets of predictors auc 0 93 the relative influence of thornthwaite pet on habitat prediction was higher than penman pet for most of the species we observed that the area of the projected suitable habitat was always higher under thornthwaite set of predictors than penman set of predictors ranges from 25 to 941 with the exception of pinus contorta for which the reverse was true in most cases these differences were non trivial indicating that the choice of the pet metric although both of them are commonly used can have dramatic consequences on the conservation management decisions therefore the conservation management decisions can be markedly different depending on the choice of the pet metric used for species distribution modeling of water limited species keywords pet penman monteith thornthwaite habitat suitability conservation 1 introduction species distribution models sdms are widely used tools for projecting distribution of species under climate change and for estimating the relative impact of various predictors of distribution chang et al 2014 guisan and thuiller 2005 mainali et al 2015 piekielek et al 2015 hence sdms may offer an opportunity to compare the relative importance of two different measures of the same underlying phenomenon to date most sdm applications have used one formulation of potential evapotranspiration pet i e thornthwaite for projecting habitat suitability of species under the climate change chang et al 2014 dilts et al 2015 this widely used formulation of pet is based only on temperature a new formulation of pet called penman monteith includes additional metrics for estimating pet as pet estimated by these two metrics differ in a given space it is reasonable to expect that the projected suitable habitat also differs depending on the metric of pet in this study we explore how two common methods of pet estimation can have different impacts on habitat projections and potential consequences on conservation efforts of water limited species across north central u s atmospheric evaporative demand often plays the dominant role in structuring the vegetation communities in water limited environment currie 1991 li et al 2013 this demand called pet has been estimated with several methods such as penman monteith monteith 1965 penman 1948 thornthwaite 1948 priestley and taylor 1972 and turc 1961 as different methods result into different pet values the choice of pet in modeling approaches may result in different ecological interpretations however the common approaches of estimating pet include penman monteith method hereafter penman and thornthwaite method hereafter thornthwaite because thornthwaite pet can be computed with temperature alone it has had wider applications alternatively penman method requires several additional variables viz solar radiation relative humidity vapor pressure deficit and wind speed although it provides a more sophisticated model of pet a reliable estimation of pet with penman has largely been a formidable challenge in past especially at large spatial extents primarily because of lack of available metrics at such spatial extents the latest generation of gcms however provide key elements required to estimate penman pet i e solar radiation vapor pressure deficit and wind speed abatzoglou and brown 2012 stocker et al 2013 taylor et al 2012 making it easier than before to compute the pet comparison of the two metrics of pet has shown considerable variation in space some have found higher penman pet compared to thornthwaite pet and others found the opposite fisher et al 2011 hobbins et al 2008 lu et al 2005 van der schrier et al 2011 a global comparison found that pet estimates by thornthwaite are higher than penman in the tropics and lower in the subtropics van der schrier et al 2011 lower pet values derived from thornthwaite types method compared to penman method have been reported for the usa fisher et al 2011 vörösmarty et al 1998 and sub saharan africa hulme et al 1996 in a recent study adhikari et al 2019 estimated lower thornthwaite pet than penman pet along a strong water balance ecotone across north central u s compared with thornthwaite penman formulation of pet validated reasonably well against field data in regional and global scale studies benli et al 2010 chen et al 2005 lópez urrea et al 2006 tukimat et al 2012 weiß and menzel 2008 the greater reliability of penman pet values is thought to be due to a more sophisticated model of pet with several variables which is expected to estimate the actual physical process more reliably than a simpler thornthwaite model of pet does lu et al 2005 because of their wider use and noticeable differences it is necessary to compare the effects of pet derived from these two methods for ecological and management applications because the two methods are substantially different in estimated pet various indices derived from these pet e g variation in aridity index palmer s drought index and moisture index should also vary considerably between penman and thornthwaite dewes et al 2017 consequently this penman thornthwaite discrepancy can have adverse impacts on strategies plans and processes for climate change adaptation mcafee 2013 therefore the choice of pet must be guided by objective evaluation of the alternate methods that provide an estimate of pet for instance future studies could project the less extreme loss of habitat suitability of water limited species under thornthwaite pet due to less atmospheric evaporative demands under thornthwaite pet past studies have demonstrated considerable difference in habitat predictions resulting from different algorithms spatial resolutions global climate models predictors sample sizes and climate change scenarios acevedo et al 2017 araújo and guisan 2006 bucklin et al 2015 henderson et al 2014 hernandez et al 2006 mainali et al 2015 pearson et al 2006 syphard and franklin 2009 2010 thuiller et al 2004 however model performance and projections of habitat suitability of species mostly influenced by moisture stress under penman vs thornthwaite pet have not been evaluated yet particularly the choice of pet estimated by an appropriate method can be of highly impactful in projecting suitable habitat in water limited environment therefore the choice of pet in sdm of water limited species can influence policy guiding efforts for conservation and management of species under current and future climates in this study we compare the impact of penman and thornthwaite pet in projecting the habitat suitability of eight dominant tree species in water limited forest ecosystems of north central u s specifically we aim to answer the following scientific questions in this study 1 does the performance of models built under the penman pet set of predictors better explain distributions of water limited tree species than those built under thornthwaite pet set the two sets keep identical set of predictors except for pet 2 to what extent does the weighting of environmental predictors differ in models using the penman vs thornthwaite formulation of pet 3 how does projected area of suitable habitat for water limited species under climate change differ under the two metrics of pet 2 methods 2 1 study area and species north central u s is our study region that spans from washington at north west to michigan at north east and from nevada at south west to tennessee at south east the study region is 3 495 769 km2 of the contiguous u s and it includes over twenty five states fig 1 the region is characterized by strong environmental gradients from drier west to high humid east due to gradients in temperature and precipitation the region comprises eight major forest communities with the following dominant tree species doulas fir psuedotsuga menziessi ponderosa pine pinus ponderosa aspen populus sp black spruce picea sp hemlock tsuga sp whitebark pine pinus albicaulis and red maple acer rubrum many forest ecosystems of this region are under various degrees of exposure to the climate change to study the difference in influence of penman pet and thornthwaite pet on habitat modeling we selected eight dominant tree species viz juniperus scopulorum pinus contorta pinus flexilis pinus ponderosa pinus resinosa pinus albicaulis pinus pungens and psuedotsuga menziessi that 1 exist in relatively dry region of north central u s and 2 have their growth and distribution strongly limited by water availability 2 2 distributional data we derived presence and absence records of each species from the u s fia program database http apps fs fed us fiadb downloads datamart html the fia has delineated the forest of our entire study area into a grid of hexagonal cells that are 2500 ha 25 km2 each in each grid cell is one long term sampling plot composed of four adjacent circles of 58 9 ft 18 m radius each a census on the trees is conducted inside these circles this systematic and through sampling across the u s provides a high quality data about tree distribution the absences were drawn from the grid cells that did not contain the species in fia data to reduce the chances of false absences we added a buffer of 5 km around each presence point and excluded any absences falling within this buffer our approach of a identifying areas of absences with thorough sampling and b excluding absent records within 5 km radius of a presence point is expected to provide high quality data for species distribution models because the absent records are more likely to represent an absent state compared to a typical sdm where pseudoabsences are drawn for a regression model like random forest we used two categories of the data represent contrasting states of presence and absence although modelers conveniently use the term pseudoabsences for the background data this collectively indicates that our models are more informed as they operate on environmental space of presences vs true absences the delineation of geographic background for obtaining absences can dramatically impact the model performance and estimated habitat suitability specifically a large background can artificially inflate model evaluation score such as auc and simultaneously give a model that does a poor job of discriminating sites for suitability in the core region of distribution acevedo 2012 therefore we adopted local convex hull approach to determine the geographic background where a model is trained a local convex hull of presences eliminates larger areas within minimum convex polygon without occurrence records thereby shrinking the background for each species we tried a range of local convex hull with different alpha parameters and selected the one that was substantially smaller than minimum convex polygon but included enough areas to contrast grid cells with presences in environmental space because we use a regression model thuiller et al 2016 that builds sdm by contrasting environmental space of presences with that of absences when the absences do not fall in the grid cells with presences we included an equal number of presence and absence records to the model 2 3 historic climate data environmental predictors including monthly average minimum and maximum temperature precipitation pet and relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed for the entire united states at 4 km spatial resolution were derived from multivariate adaptive constructive analogs maca products available predictors in maca data have been derived by a statistical downscaling method and calibrated with observed meteorological dataset i e training dataset from several weather stations to make compatible spatial patterns after correcting historical biases these predictors are available through webpage of university of idaho https climate northwestknowledge net maca abatzoglou and brown 2012 maca data incorporates daily data from general circulation models and validated over western united states by global reanalysis data the advantage of maca data over other downscaled data includes the following 1 maca avoids interpolation based methods with the use of analogs and 2 maca s multivariate approach to improve the physical relationships among the variables abatzoglou and brown 2012 the 4 km spatial resolution data was again statistically downscaled to 1 km spatial resolution available pet estimates in maca product was computed with penman monteith method using solar radiation humidity and wind velocity data a subset of each predictor was created with a shape file of our study area fig 1 monthly average thornthwaite pet was estimated using monthly average temperature from maca products following a method described in chang et al 2014 all the historic climate data were summarized as monthly average for the period of 1980 2006 2 4 non climate predictors in addition to the climatic variables we used aridity index available water holding capacity awhc and sand miller and white 1998 as non climatic predictors to project habitat suitability of species 2 5 collinearity analysis eighty seven predictors were initially considered for each species for constructing sdms for a given species the only predictor that was different between penman and thornthwaite set was the measure of pet penman pet vs thornthwaite pet before the collinearity analysis highly collinear predictors do not uniquely contribute to the model but such a collinearity among predictors can be problematic when assessing significance of individual parameters therefore we eliminated highly correlated predictors of each species from the set using software for assisted habitat modeling sahm embedded in the vistrails scientific workflow management system morisette et al 2013 specifically for each species we eliminated predictors from the set such that the remaining covariates have a pearson s correlation coefficient of 0 70 since this was performed for each species separately the final set of predictors for each species was different however different species do not necessarily have the same collinearity between two predictors this set of predictors was paired with 1 penman pet to create one set of predictors hereafter penman set and with 2 thornthwaite pet to create another set of predictors hereafter thornthwaite set the differences in the habitat suitability estimates with the use of penman set and thornthwaite set would be the unique effect of penman pet and thornthwaite pet when several other predictors are included as predictors 2 6 gcm and future climate data to understand impacts of warming under climate change from 2071 to 2099 we adopted two climate change scenarios with the same set of climate variables projected by general circulation model gcm selected two climate change scenarios include high and low representative concentrative pathway rcp8 5 and rcp4 5 from 2010 to 2099 the rcp 8 5 scenario represents the amount of anthropogenic forcing of 8 5 w m2 consistent with increases in atmospheric greenhouse gases at current rates whereas rcp 4 5 represents anthropogenic forcing of 4 5 w m2 a significant reduction in global greenhouse emissions moss et al 2010 for each of these two emission scenarios the future climates were created by averaging their prediction for the period of 2071 2099 from a warm and dry ccsm4 gcm both historical and future environmental variables are similar but future ones are projected under climate change scenarios the ccsm4 gcm moderately captures overall spread of future projections of temperature and precipitation changes across the study area adhikari and hansen 2019 adhikari et al 2019 2 7 species distribution models to model species distribution we used random forest rf implemented in biomod2 software programmed in r environment thuiller et al 2016 as it is one of the most efficient modeling methods used in species distribution modeling magness et al 2008 mainali et al 2015 often single decision tree or classification and regression tree cart may end up with high variance and high biases contrary to cart the advance extension of rf builds multiple decision trees using subsamples of available input variables this makes the model more stable with better generalization and higher predictive power of independent data breiman 2001 rf has been found in omitting noises in the input variables to improve accuracy and control over fitting matsuki et al 2016 2 8 model development and evaluation since no independent dataset was available the presence absence data of each species was randomly split in a ratio that 80 data have been used for model development calibration and 20 data have been used for model evaluation with 5 fold cross validation dormann et al 2012 the calibration and evaluation selection was run for 100 times before analysis the result the accuracy of the model was assessed from the data generated by the split sample using two metrics area under the curve auc of receiver operator characteristic roc curves and true skill statistic tss these two metrics consider different weights associated with various types of prediction errors of omission commission or confusion widely reported auc metric is both threshold and prevalence independent model evaluation metric fielding and bell 1997 models with the auc value 0 70 is considered as poor 0 7 0 9 as moderate and 0 9 a good model tss is threshold dependent metrics for model evaluation which ranged between 1 no agreement and 1 total agreement landis and koch 1977 we interpreted tss statistics as 0 4 were poor 0 4 0 8 useful and 0 8 good to excellent r script of the analysis is included in supplement 2 9 analysis we compared auc and tss scores secured by the best models created from penman set vs thornthwaite set the study also compared the relative influence of the predictors on habitat predictions of each species under two sets of predictors we categorized probability or habitat suitability into two categories as below suitable greater than 0 50 and unsuitable less than 0 50 we then assessed the ratio of the suitable area predicted by penman set to the thornthwaite set 3 results each species ended up with different numbers of predictors for model trainings after removing autocorrelated predictors fig 2 interestingly the final set of predictors of a species were very similar in the two sets of pet available water holding capacity and soil texture percent sand were common predictors among all species our results showed no difference in performance of the models constructed with the two sets of predictors table 1 overall the models under both sets penman and thornthwaite of predictors secure good to excellent score in prediction with the auc and tss values ranging from 0 93 to 0 98 and 0 71 to 0 85 respectively except that auc was 0 84 0 86 tss was 0 58 0 61under both sets of predictors for p pungens auc is a popular metric of model evaluation when a model needs to be evaluated for both false positive and false negative a situation that is not typical of traditional ecological analysis but definitely a concern in sdm this metric is highly intuitive to modelers therefore it has a wider application in sdm work however studies have shown many times that auc can be unreliable in certain conditions e g lobo et al 2008 mainali et al 2015 to minimize this challenge we employed alpha hull of presences for selecting absences also the design of the study true absences would mean that auc should reflect true underlying model performance which is in contrast to a typical sdm where the background points are used as pseudoabsences this made us confident that auc is the right choice of model evaluation and we stuck to it because scientific community is more comfortable to this metric to add to our analysis we also computed tss score these two model evaluation scores are strongly correlated with r2 0 96 this indicates that the traditionally reported problems with auc are virtually absent in our study therefore we reported the model output of habitat suitability based on widely used auc among the environmental predictors precipitation had highest influence on habitat distribution of all species except p resinosa under penman pet set fig 2 however thornthwaite pet showed highest influence on predicting habitat of all species except p resinosa under thornthwaite set therefore as the most dominant pattern in influential predictors thornthwaite set identifies thornthwaite pet itself as the most influential predictor whereas penman set identifies predictors other than the measure of pet as the most influential predictors under both sets of predictors soil texture sand was the most influential factor for the distribution of p resinosa fig 2 available soil water holding capacity showed some degree of influence on the habitat distribution of p contorta p flexilis p resinosa and p menziesii fig 2 under both set of predictors solar radiation from march to july showed some influence over the distribution of j scopulorum and p menziesii may to september precipitation showed considerable impacts on distribution of j scopulorum p flexilis p ponderosa p albicaulis and p menziesii under both sets of predictors fig 2 january precipitation showed the greatest impacts on distribution of p pungens under both pet interestingly the influence of precipitation on habitat prediction of all species was lower under thornthwaite set than under penman set it is easy to see that this difference is offset by the difference in influence of the metric of pet itself a total of 48 separate maps of habitat suitability fig 3 were generated for 8 species 3 climate scenarios current rcp4 5 rcp8 5 2 sets of predictors penman and thornthwaite the extent of suitable habitat under current climate was predicted higher by thornthwaite set than penman set for five species viz j scopulorum p ponderosa p resinosa p menziesii and p pungens figs 3 5 table 2 all of these species except p resinosa showed a marked decline in suitable habitat in future with the difference between penman and thornthwaite remaining similar as under current climate for two species p albicaulis and p flexilus predicted current habitat was similar under both penman and thornthwaite but they diverge in future showing similar effect as in the other species i e thornthwaite predicting larger extent than penman the only species that exhibited larger extent predicted by penman than thornthwaite under any climate is p contorta the percentage change in habitat of all species in future compared to current prediction are listed in table 3 overall thornthwaite set predicted larger extent of suitable habitat than penman set did for all scenarios current rcp 4 5 rcp 8 5 of all species with two exceptions 1 the prediction was similar for p albicaulis and p flexilis under current climate and 2 the predictions are in reverse direction penman thornthwaite for p contorta under all climate fig 5 4 discussion various metrics of potential evapotranspiration pet have been used in studies related to ecology conservation biogeography climate change etc where the choice of pet metric is apparently driven more by convenience and less by justification given that each metric of pet is specific in its parameters and model structure the measure of pet is metric specific though a thorough comparison of different metrics on species distribution has never been tested projected species distributions have been used in various kinds of management decisions and research questions here we perform the first multi species comparison of two widely used measures of pet and show how they result in similar or different projection of species distribution additional novelties of our study includes the following 1 this is the first ever application of penman monteith estimate of pet in species distribution modeling 2 we downscaled maca variables to a spatial resolution that is ecologically relevant to tree species distribution maca product is special in that it offers many non standard climatic variables for future that are not available from other sources and 3 we applied our model across a continental water balance ecotone where the spatial pattern of water limitation emphasizes the need to represent pet adequately in modeling efforts collectively our study makes a case for future modeling efforts of tree species distributions using a metric of pet that is more appropriate for the studied system and geographical area in this study we compared influenced of pet estimated by two methods on habitat suitability of eight dominant tree species of north central us region which is mostly driven by moisture stress for each species we predicted the habitat suitability with two sets of identical environmental predictors under penman and thornthwaite pet where the only difference is in the metric of pet different species can have different set of predictors this design of keeping all the predictors constant and varying only one predictor of interest pet allows us to directly and quantitatively compare the relative importance of two measures of pet penman vs thornthwaite because the metric of pet is one of the most important predictors of the species distribution in moisture limited environment the estimated importance of the pet as predictor is interpretable as a measure of variable importance that is unique to pet when all the other predictors correlated and uncorrelated to pet are also included in the model because these two metrics are commonly used estimates of pet the discrepancy between the two models in projecting species distribution will have important consequences in conservation and restoration planning their difference in relative influence indicates the unique contribution of the metric in explaining species distribution we show that the distribution of these species is projected substantially differently under penman pet vs thornthwaite pet metrics however the predictive performance of models built with two sets of predictors was similar within a species the accuracy of current modeling method is high showing good to excellent model performance under auc model evaluation metrics and the two sets of predictors do not differ in model performance however the observed dissimilarities in species distribution projections could be due to the impacts of limiting factors on growth and distribution of plant species which are captured differently by the regression models built based on penman set of predictors vs thornthwaite set of predictors e g sandy soil explained higher variability in habitat projection of p resinosa the interpretation of high performance of the models has some important caveats first the model performance metric is relevant only to model training and testing areas the region of model projection can be much larger beyond the geographic space of model construction the evaluation metric is irrelevant and models with very high evaluation metric in the model construction range can yield an unrealistic model for projecting far from the training area mainali et al 2015 second a good fit of model with current distribution does not necessarily indicate the similar performance in the future porfirio et al 2014 the underlying statistical relationship between environmental factors and suitable habitat of the species may change over time these two types of challenges collectively indicate that the spatial first challenge and temporal second one stability of the species distribution models may not be as good as we desire and unfortunately our study can have both types of challenges auc has been criticized as an unreliable metric of model evaluation metric in sdm with valid reasons lobo et al 2008 mainali et al 2015 it is sensitive to geographic background lobo et al 2008 it is entirely possible to secure a very high auc and yield a useless model acevedo 2017 our study design is different from a traditional sdm study and so does not suffer from the same problems reported elsewhere for the following reasons first we do not use pseudoabsences we have real absences collected by a long term systematic data collection effort of large institutions that have well set standards second contrary to a standard sdm that uses a convex hull we shrank the background by using alpha hull third our approach does a fair job in comparing the models because the penman vs thornthwaite set of predictors were supplied with the same set of presence absence data including x fold split of points into training and testing set in such situations even when the absolute value of auc is not reliable the relative difference is an indicator of model fit to data therefore we have confidence in our results based on models evaluated with auc using eight tree species of water limited environment we have demonstrated that uncertainties associated with methodological issues of important variables can affect model outputs substantially this is not a situation of missing out an important predictor rather this is an issue of two different approaches of estimating an important predictor which is pet a sub optimal choice of the model for estimating pet may lead into erroneous planning for conservation and management of targeted species although no past studies explicitly considered the issues on variation in habitat prediction due to difference in pet from two methods our study suggests that the discrepancies in model outputs of different species have been associated with the sets of predictors under penman and thornthwaite pet among eight species considered for this study the model showed that the predicted habitat suitability was higher under thornthwaite set for current and both climate change scenarios than for penman set for all species except p contorta since many past studies reported lower pet values estimated by thornthwaite method adhikari et al 2019 fisher et al 2011 hulme et al 1996 the habitat suitability of water limited species under the influence of thornthwaite pet should be over predicted because of low atmospheric evaporative demands under thornthwaite method this study showed that difference in estimation method of the identical predictors here pet can alter influence of other variables on modeling outputs in this study the unique contribution of precipitation in explaining species distribution is higher under penman set for most of the species for example under the penman set july precipitation was the most important predictor of the habitat of p flexilis p ponderosa and j scopulorum but this was replaced by july pet with the thornthwaite set this may be due to the change in the extent of collinearity between the predictors when multiple methods produce different outputs for the same predictors in addition this variation is contingent upon the species types environmental conditions and geographical locations acevedo et al 2012 syphard and franklin 2009 the contribution of temperature on distribution is lower for all species given that these species grow in water limited environments it is not surprising to see a lesser role of temperature in determining distribution however the impacts of other variables are similar under both sets of predictors showing less importance on distribution of water limited plants 4 1 management and conservation implications the consideration of potential range of a species for conservation and management depends upon the predictive ability of models for habitat suitability and identification of appropriate environmental predictors discrepancies in model predictions due to different sets of environmental predictors can impair the conservation and resource management planning for example it is important to be cautious during formulation of management plans for p resinosa as the model predicted decreases in suitable habitat under penman set and increases under thornthwaite set this species can be categorized as highly vulnerable when habitat is predicted under penman pet set hence the study suggests for a careful consideration of model outputs generated by using appropriate predictors as several other studies have shown that penman estimate of pet is more reliable than thornthwaite lópez urrea et al 2006 weiß and menzel 2008 benli et al 2010 these prior studies can be a guide for selecting appropriate set of predictors even for species for which the future predictions are markedly different between penman vs thornthwaite set 5 conclusion penman and thornthwaite are commonly used measures of pet these two measures are substantially different in model structure and complexity whereas penman is considered to represent pet more accurately than thornthwaite the latter has wider availability in this study we performed a litmus test of how these two metrics of pet perform in predicting species distribution of eight species from moisture stress environment for entire species range thornthwaite predicted higher area than penman in most of the cases climatic scenarios of eight species and the differences are non trivial hence it is important to indicate that 1 the two metrics of pet are substantially different in predicting species range or highly suitable habitat and 2 these differences are not uniform across species i e one or the other metric of pet can predict higher suitable area for different species therefore the conservation management decisions can be markedly different depending on the metric of pet used for sdm it is important to emphasize that the ease of availability should not drive the use of thornthwaite pet neither should the model complexity of penman should make it more desirable whereas a more complex formulation of penman pet might be better able to characterize the actual pet because of its associated several additional variables a careful comparison of the two metrics in a given area and study systems would yield most accurate projection of species distribution author s contribution each author has made significant

24957,predicting post fire tree mortality is a major area of research in fire prone forests woodlands and savannas worldwide past research has relied overwhelmingly on logistic regression analysis lr that predicts post fire tree status as a binary outcome i e living or dead one of the most problematic issues for lr or any classification problem occurs when there is a class imbalance in the training data in these instances predictions will be biased toward the majority class using a historical prescribed fire data set of longleaf pines pinus palustris from northern florida usa we compare results from standard lr and the machine learning algorithm random forest rf first we demonstrate the class imbalance problem using simulated data we then show how a balanced rf model can be used to alleviate the bias in the model and improve mortality prediction results in the simulated example lr model sensitivity and specificity was clearly biased based on the degree of imbalance between the classes the balanced rf models had consistent sensitivity and specificity throughout the simulated data sets re analyzing the original longleaf pine data set with a balanced rf model showed that although both lr and rf models had similar areas under the receiver operating curve auc the rf model had better discrimination for predicting new observations of dead trees both lr and rf models identified duff consumption and percent crown scorch as important predictors of tree mortality however the rf model also suggested pre fire duff depth as an important predictor our analysis highlights

problem however lr alone is not a classification algorithm each predicted observation is a probability of a positive outcome in this case a probability of mortality to classify an observation the user must select a threshold probability above which the tree is predicted to die typically this threshold is set at 0 5 or 0 6 ryan and reinhardt 1988 regelbrugge and conard 1993 keyser et al 2006 thies

data not used in the model fitting process recent evaluation efforts have shown mixed results in predictive accuracy hood et al 2007b ganio and progar 2017 kane et al 2017a grayson et al 2017 hood and lutes 2017 furniss et al 2019 mortality models are often site and or species specific and therefore can perform poorly at predicting new data which underscores the importance for validating models for example ganio and progar 2017 found that their logistic regression models for ponderosa pine pinus ponderosa and douglas fir pseudotsuga menziesii had low sensitivity but high specificity the disparity between sensitivity and specificity found in the validation of mortality models has led many to suggest that the threshold probability should be changed to reflect the management goals of the user hood et al 2007a cansler et al 2019 for example if accurate prediction of dead trees is more important than accurate prediction of live trees the user can adjust the threshold probability for the classification hood et al 2010 ganio and progar 2017 grayson et al 2017 the pattern of low sensitivity and high specificity or vice versa is common in tree mortality models as well as in classification models in other disciplines where the response classes of the training data are heavily imbalanced e g there are many more live trees than dead trees in these so called rare events models such as logistic regression underestimate the probability of the rare class king and zeng 2001 for example alberg et al 2004 demonstrated that when prevalence of a disease deviates away from 50 sensitivity and specificity are conversely increased or decreased depending on the direction of the deviation post fire tree mortality data sets typically suffer from class imbalance for instance in prescribed fires where primary objectives typically include minimizing overstory mortality and the fire is generally a low to moderate intensity surface fire logistic regression equations for post fire tree mortality are likely to underestimate post fire tree mortality in order to improve our ability to predict post fire tree mortality there is a major need to evaluate alternative analytical methods to the lr model barnard et al 2019 one classification algorithm known to excel in predicting new observations is random forest rf breiman 2001a random forest is an extension of classification and regression trees cart see de ath and fabricius 2000 that consists of a collection of cart style trees in which each tree casts a vote for which class e g live or dead is predicted breiman 2001a b for each classification tree a random set of observations are selected with replacement as well as a random selection of predictor variables those observations not selected for fitting an individual classification tree are considered out of bag oob samples and are used to assess error the use of randomly selected predictors and oob samples for validation reduces the bias in rf models and prevents overfitting the data breiman 2001a however because rf models are a bootstrap sample of the training data they are also sensitive to imbalanced classes when classes are heavily imbalanced the probability is high that some of the bootstrap samples will not contain any observations of the minority class chen et al 2004 to solve this issue chen et al 2004 proposed the balanced random forest algorithm which draws an equal number of observations for each class in our case equal numbers of living and dead trees in this study we investigate the utility of rf as an alternative to lr to model fire induced tree mortality following prescribed fire we test the impact of model selection on an existing data set of fire induced mortality in long unburned longleaf pine pinus palustris mill forests in north florida usa data from varner et al 2007 we demonstrate the class imbalance problem with post fire mortality prediction using lr and rf on simulated data and compare variable importance and cross validated predictions between the two analysis methods on the original data we then discuss the advantages and disadvantages of rf analyses for post fire tree mortality prediction and how to apply this model more broadly to enhance post fire mortality prediction accuracy 2 materials methods 2 1 field data we used the data set from varner et al 2007 as the basis for all of our data analyses table 1 to demonstrate the class imbalance problem with post fire mortality prediction compare results of lr and rf and discuss advantages and disadvantages of the two methods the data are from long unburned longleaf pine forests at eglin air force base in northwest florida treated with prescribed fire stands consisted of a sparse remnant longleaf pine overstory of approximately 45 200 trees 10 cm dbh ha 1 and midstories dominated by quercus laevis walt q geminata small pinus clausa chapman ex engelm vasey ex sarg var immuginata and ilex vomitoria ait varner et al 2007 the climate of the area is subtropical with warm humid summers and mild winters mean temperature of the study area is 19 7 c and mean annual precipitation is 1580 mm overing et al 1995 prescribed fires were conducted in 2001 and 2002 from february to april the original study was established as a randomized block experiment consisting of four blocks where day of burn duff moisture content varied among sites from dry 55 dry mass moist 85 dry mass and wet 115 dry mass the unburned control treatments that were not burned in varner et al 2007 were not included in this study forest floor depth was measured at the base of 50 randomly selected longleaf pines 15 cm diameter in each 10 ha burn unit by horizon including litter oi horizon and duff oe and oa organic soil horizons at each tree eight evenly spaced pins 20 cm tall were buried flush with the litter surface prior to ignition and measured after the prescribed fire to estimate litter and duff consumption crown volume scorched was estimated using the methods in peterson 1985 bole char heights were measured as the average of four measurements tree injury was assessed within six weeks of all burns and mortality was surveyed every six months for two years post fire 2 2 simulated data analysis to demonstrate the class imbalance problem we simulated nine new data sets of 10 000 observations where each data set varied in the mortality rate from 10 to 90 dead trees for each live class and dead class in each new simulated data set we also simulated two injuries crown scorch and duff consumption based a random sample of a normal distribution that had the same means and standard deviations of the original data see table 1 for means and standard deviations from varner et al 2007 we fit lr models to each simulated data set using the glm function in the r package stats r core team 2018 we then fit a balanced rf model to the same data using the randomforest function in the package randomforest with 10 000 classification trees and the sampsize parameter set to randomly select 100 live and 100 dead trees for each classification tree liaw and wiener 2002 crown volume scorched and duff consumption were the only predictor variables included in both lr and rf models we repeated this process creating new data sets and refitting the models 100 times model accuracy was determined by predicting the training data with the models and determining each models sensitivity and specificity using the following formulas s e n s i t i v i t y t p t p f n s p e c i f i c i t y t n t n f p where tp and tn are the number of true positive and true negative predictions respectively and fp and fn are the number of false positive and false negative predictions respectively for the lr models a threshold of 0 5 was used to determine mortality 2 3 original data analysis to explore variable importance between lr and rf generated models and to show how rf models can be useful in interpreting tree mortality we reanalyzed the original data set of 443 longleaf pine trees using the randomforest function in addition to crown scorch and duff consumption we included dbh char height scorch height pre fire duff depth and pre fire litter depth as predictor variables we fit lr models using crown scorch and duff consumption as predictors since varner et al 2007 fit a full model and then followed standard model reductions procedures to develop a final model that only includes these two significant variables we set the sampsize parameter to select 10 live and dead trees for each classification tree variable importance was determined using the varimpplot function in the randomforest package in rf models variable importance is determined by calculating the mean decrease in accuracy when a variable is removed from the model by permuting the oob data liaw and wiener 2002 we used the r package pdp to plot the partial dependence functions greenwell 2017 partial dependence functions plot the overall estimated change in the probability of mortality as a predictor varies over its distribution goldstein et al 2015 2 4 cross validation we used repeated 5 fold cross validation to compare rf and lr models on the original data the data were randomly grouped into five equally sized subsets both lr and rf models were fit to four groups the training data sets and used to predict the data in the one group not used in model fitting the test data set the lr models used a threshold probability of 0 5 to determine mortality while the rf models used the majority vote of classification trees this process was repeated such that each group was used once as a test data set for each model that was fit we calculated the roc curve and subsequent auc using the roc and auc functions in the r package proc robin et al 2011 probabilities for the rf models used to calculate the roc curve were based on proportion of votes of the classification trees the cross validation was repeated ten times with new random subsets assigned after each repetition we used the createfolds function in the r package caret to subset the data for each repetition kuhn 2008 3 results 3 1 simulated data effects of class imbalance increasing the class imbalance had a striking effect on the lr post fire longleaf pine mortality models fig 1 a at the lowest mortality rate sensitivity was low and specificity was high as the lr models predicted live trees with high accuracy and dead trees with low accuracy logistic regression models trained with balanced classes 50 mortality had average sensitivity rates of 0 83 and average specificity rates of 0 80 at higher mortality rates sensitivity was high and specificity was low in contrast the rf models had more consistent sensitivity and specificity rates than the lr models fig 1b average accuracy for the rf models ranged from 0 85 0 87 for sensitivity and from 0 79 0 81 for specificity 3 2 original data variable importance to predict tree mortality the rf model trained on the original longleaf pine data from varner et al 2007 provided additional insights into variable importance for predicting post fire tree mortality in agreement with the lr model duff consumption was the most important predictor of post fire tree mortality in long unburned longleaf pine stands for the rf model fig 2 additionally the rf model showed that crown volume scorched and pre fire duff depth were also important positive predictors of fire induced tree mortality all other predictors i e dbh char height scorch height and pre fire litter depth in the model had little to no impact on model accuracy the partial dependence plots showed that increasing duff consumption increased the average probability of tree mortality in the model from approximately 0 25 to 0 6 over the range of 0 100 duff consumption fig 3 a crown scorch also increased the probability of tree mortality from approximately 0 3 to 0 5 over the range of 0 100 scorch fig 3b although pre fire duff depth was nearly as important as fire caused crown scorch the partial dependence plot of duff depth on the probability of tree mortality was mostly flat with a slight increase in the probability of about 0 05 for trees with duff depths 8 cm fig 3c the combined partial dependence of duff consumption and crown scorch shows that trees with high scorch and high duff consumption had a higher probability of mortality than trees with high scorch or high duff consumption alone fig 4 a likewise the combination of a thick pre fire duff layer and high duff consumption had high probability of mortality fig 4b partial dependence plots for pre fire duff and crown scorch showed minimal increases in mortality with increases of both predictor variables fig 4c the 5 fold cross validation of the lr and rf models fit to the original data from varner et al 2007 showed similar results to the simulation data at the lowest mortality level 10 the lr models had an average sensitivity of 0 32 and average specificity of 0 99 fig 5 the rf models were more consistent with average sensitivity of 0 70 and average specificity of 0 80 fig 5 the auc values from the roc curves were similar for both model types with an average auc of 0 87 for lr and 0 85 for rf fig 5 4 discussion traditional post fire tree mortality lr models trained with data containing heavily imbalanced response classes can severely under predict the minority class in most prescribed fire cases dead trees these results are consistent with the findings in other disciplines that use lr to model binary outcomes such as disease diagnostic tests in medical fields alberg et al 2004 to our knowledge no studies in the post fire tree mortality literature have specifically dealt with the problem of imbalance classes on the training data of lr models all of the current fire modeling tools available to practitioners rely on lr for the prediction of tree mortality it is likely that the class imbalance problem is a major contributor to the poor predictive performance observed in tree mortality models validated in the literature grayson et al 2017 ganio and progar 2017 hood and lutes 2017 kane et al 2017a in our study we show that balanced rf models can be a potential solution to the class imbalance problem in post fire tree mortality models king and zeng 2001 proposed that the class imbalance problem can be mitigated during the data collection stage of a study they suggest using an endogenous stratified sampling strategy as a more efficient sampling design for models with rare events for example if post fire tree mortality is low collect all or a subset of dead tree observations and then a random equal sample of live tree observations this sampling strategy not only solves the class imbalance issue but can also save on resources for data collection king and zeng 2001 hood et al 2010 used a slightly different sampling approach that resulted in approximately equal number of live and dead trees to develop lr mortality models for california conifers following wildfire they sampled trees across a matrix of low to high crown and bole injury ranges for different tree sizes and species targeting approximately 30 sample trees within each combination of species size class crown injury class and bole injury class using 10 fold cross validation hood et al 2010 evaluated the accuracy of their models and found false positive and negative rates varied but all were higher than 0 6 and most were higher than 0 7 although hood et al 2010 validated their models with data not used in the model fitting process using cross validation as we did with ours they note that the data are still from the same fires and ideally the models should be tested on new data from fires on separate sites grayson et al 2017 however included the models from hood et al 2010 in their validation of models in the literature on a new data set and found that they were not among the best fitting models this might suggest that one or more additional predictors are missing to extend their applicability to other geographic areas or for different forest conditions e g predictors incorporating spatial dispersion or competition random forest models may be a better option in predicting new data due to the ability to incorporate a large number of predictor variables studies and model development that require pre fire measures of the trees or local fuels that may be modified by the fire as with pre fire duff depth in the longleaf pine data set would complicate the endogenous stratification approach but extensive pre fire measures of these conditions or modeled a priori relationships could be used to ameliorate this issue in their original study using lr varner et al 2007 found that the best predictors of individual mortality of longleaf pine were the percent of duff consumed in the fire and the percent crown volume scorched with scorch only significant in the dry duff moisture treatment post fire tree mortality was significantly higher in the dry duff moisture treatment than any other treatment varner et al 2007 duff consumption was six times greater in the dry duff moisture treatment than in the wet treatment and three times greater than in the moist treatment varner et al 2007 as with many prescribed fire studies overall tree mortality was low with mean mortality rates of 0 5 3 0 and 20 5 for the wet moist and dry treatments respectively the original longleaf pine mortality data had a class imbalance of 400 live trees to 43 dead trees as a result the cross validated lr model using a threshold of 0 5 performed poorly at predicting dead trees low sensitivity and predicted live trees with high accuracy high specificity several studies suggest that a different threshold value should be used to accommodate for the differences in sensitivity and specificity based on management objectives hood et al 2010 ganio and progar 2017 grayson et al 2017 cansler et al 2019 the fact that the auc values of both lr and rf models were nearly identical indicates that the potential discriminatory ability of both models is similar and that adjusting the threshold value of the lr models could yield similar accuracy to the rf model as adjusting the threshold does not affect the auc this solution as our study illustrates sidesteps an important point the mortality probabilities estimated by lr are likely to be biased we suggest using balanced rf as a better solution as there is no need to specify a single threshold criterion by default rf models use the majority vote of each classification tree in the forest to determine the predicted outcome the proportion of votes in a rf model can also be used in the same manner as a threshold probability in lr models should management applications require a different decision criterion than the majority random forest models have been shown to provide exceptional predictive performance breiman 2001a b prasad et al 2006 rodriguez galiano et al 2012 for example rodriguez galiano et al 2012 found that rf correctly classified remotely sensed land cover data with an accuracy of 92 random forest models can also effectively predict fire impacts across large landscapes including fire severity and post fire forest structure kane et al 2015a b random forest models also have several appealing statistical qualities in that they do not make any distributional assumptions about the data they can handle a high number of predictor variables and they are not sensitive to missing values cutler et al 2007 additionally rf models can evaluate more than two classes as well as continuous response variables although multinomial lr can be used to model more than two response classes and linear regression can be used to model continuous response variables it is still often necessary to reduce the dimensionality of the data in lr and other traditional statistical methods especially if there are high correlations among predictor variables breiman 2001b argues that by reducing the dimensionality of the data one also reduces potentially valuable information for prediction by including the full suite of predictors in our rf model we identified a relationship with pre fire duff depth that was not evident in the lr model of varner et al 2007 past and future studies on post fire tree mortality may benefit by using rf and including additional potential predictors as well as considering model performance for continuous responses such as growth or estimates of vigor instead of coarse binary responses of live or dead one of the criticisms of rf models is that they are a black box with the model using complex and largely unknown mechanisms to produce predictions from the predictor variables breiman 2001b partial dependence functions can help with some of the interpretation but rf models are generally poor at interpretability and are not a tool to be used for hypothesis testing breiman 2001b cutler et al 2007 random forest models do not generate p values nor estimate confidence intervals which may be a drawback for some users however cutler et al 2007 suggest that the results of rf models can be used as inputs to more traditional multivariate statistical techniques regardless because predicting post fire tree mortality is a classification problem accurate prediction is more important for many applications than interpretability decision support tools designed to assist land managers with predicting fire caused tree mortality such as the software program first order fire effects model fofem lutes 2018 may improve by incorporating balanced rf models in future versions there are several potential benefits for land managers including the ability to enter new data and have the model update predictions to improve local estimates for example rf could potentially allow users to add new predictors to the model without the need to check that all the assumptions of lr are met and without the need to explicitly state interactive effects future decision support tools could therefore learn to provide more accurate predictions specific to different environments at the same time the data that are provided by the users can be sent to the researchers that develop the software for evaluation an application such as this could greatly increase our ability to rapidly incorporate new data into predictive modeling systems and increase our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of fire induced tree mortality hood et al 2018 author contributions

24957,predicting post fire tree mortality is a major area of research in fire prone forests woodlands and savannas worldwide past research has relied overwhelmingly on logistic regression analysis lr that predicts post fire tree status as a binary outcome i e living or dead one of the most problematic issues for lr or any classification problem occurs when there is a class imbalance in the training data in these instances predictions will be biased toward the majority class using a historical prescribed fire data set of longleaf pines pinus palustris from northern florida usa we compare results from standard lr and the machine learning algorithm random forest rf first we demonstrate the class imbalance problem using simulated data we then show how a balanced rf model can be used to alleviate the bias in the model and improve mortality prediction results in the simulated example lr model sensitivity and specificity was clearly biased based on the degree of imbalance between the classes the balanced rf models had consistent sensitivity and specificity throughout the simulated data sets re analyzing the original longleaf pine data set with a balanced rf model showed that although both lr and rf models had similar areas under the receiver operating curve auc the rf model had better discrimination for predicting new observations of dead trees both lr and rf models identified duff consumption and percent crown scorch as important predictors of tree mortality however the rf model also suggested pre fire duff depth as an important predictor our analysis highlights

sensitivity and specificity are conversely increased or decreased depending on the direction of the deviation post fire tree mortality data sets typically suffer from class imbalance for instance in prescribed fires where primary objectives typically include minimizing overstory mortality and the fire is generally a low to moderate intensity surface fire logistic regression equations for post fire tree mortality are likely to underestimate post fire tree mortality in order to improve our ability to predict post fire tree mortality there is a major need to evaluate alternative analytical methods to the lr model barnard et al 2019 one classification algorithm known to excel in predicting new observations is random forest rf breiman 2001a random forest is an extension of classification and regression trees cart see de ath and fabricius 2000 that consists of a collection of cart style trees in which each tree casts a vote for which class e g live or dead is predicted breiman 2001a b for each classification tree a random set of observations are selected with replacement as well as a random selection of predictor variables those observations not selected for fitting an individual classification tree are considered out of bag oob samples and are used to assess error the use of randomly selected predictors and oob samples for validation reduces the bias in rf models and prevents overfitting the data breiman 2001a however because rf models are a bootstrap sample of the training data they are also sensitive to imbalanced classes when classes are heavily imbalanced the probability is high that some of the bootstrap samples will not contain any observations of the minority class chen et al 2004 to solve this issue chen et al 2004 proposed the balanced random forest algorithm which draws an equal number of observations for each class in our case equal numbers of living and dead trees in this study we investigate the utility of rf as an alternative to lr to model fire induced tree mortality following prescribed fire we test the impact of model selection on an existing data set of fire induced mortality in long unburned longleaf pine pinus palustris mill forests in north florida usa data from varner et al 2007 we demonstrate the class imbalance problem with post fire mortality prediction using lr and rf on simulated data and compare variable importance and cross validated predictions between the two analysis methods on the original data we then discuss the advantages and disadvantages of rf analyses for post fire tree mortality prediction and how to apply this model more broadly to enhance post fire mortality prediction accuracy 2 materials methods 2 1 field data we used the data set from varner et al 2007 as the basis for all of our data analyses table 1 to demonstrate the class imbalance problem with post fire mortality prediction compare results of lr and rf and discuss advantages and disadvantages of the two methods the data are from long unburned longleaf pine forests at eglin air force base in northwest florida treated with prescribed fire stands consisted of a sparse remnant longleaf pine overstory of approximately 45 200 trees 10 cm dbh ha 1 and midstories dominated by quercus laevis walt q geminata small pinus clausa chapman ex engelm vasey ex sarg var immuginata and ilex vomitoria ait varner et al 2007 the climate of the area is subtropical with warm humid summers and mild winters mean temperature of the study area is 19 7 c and mean annual precipitation is 1580 mm overing et al 1995 prescribed fires were conducted in 2001 and 2002 from february to april the original study was established as a randomized block experiment consisting of four blocks where day of burn duff moisture content varied among sites from dry 55 dry mass moist 85 dry mass and wet 115 dry mass the unburned control treatments that were not burned in varner et al 2007 were not included in this study forest floor depth was measured at the base of 50 randomly selected longleaf pines 15 cm diameter in each 10 ha burn unit by horizon including litter oi horizon and duff oe and oa organic soil horizons at each tree eight evenly spaced pins 20 cm tall were buried flush with the litter surface prior to ignition and measured after the prescribed fire to estimate litter and duff consumption crown volume scorched was estimated using the methods in peterson 1985 bole char heights were measured as the average of four measurements tree injury was assessed within six weeks of all burns and mortality was surveyed every six months for two years post fire 2 2 simulated data analysis to demonstrate the class imbalance problem we simulated nine new data sets of 10 000 observations where each data set varied in the mortality rate from 10 to 90 dead trees for each live class and dead class in each new simulated data set we also simulated two injuries crown scorch and duff consumption based a random sample of a normal distribution that had the same means and standard deviations of the original data see table 1 for means and standard deviations from varner et al 2007 we fit lr models to each simulated data set using the glm function in the r package stats r core team 2018 we then fit a balanced rf model to the same data using the randomforest function in the package randomforest with 10 000 classification trees and the sampsize parameter set to randomly select 100 live and 100 dead trees for each classification tree liaw and wiener 2002 crown volume scorched and duff consumption were the only predictor variables included in both lr and rf models we repeated this process creating new data sets and refitting the models 100 times model accuracy was determined by predicting the training data with the models and determining each models sensitivity and specificity using the following formulas s e n s i t i v i t y t p t p f n s p e c i f i c i t y t n t n f p where tp and tn are the number of true positive and true negative predictions respectively and fp and fn are the number of false positive and false negative predictions respectively for the lr models a threshold of 0 5 was used to determine mortality 2 3 original data analysis to explore variable importance between lr and rf generated models and to show how rf models can be useful in interpreting tree mortality we reanalyzed the original data set of 443 longleaf pine trees using the randomforest function in addition to crown scorch and duff consumption we included dbh char height scorch height pre fire duff depth and pre fire litter depth as predictor variables we fit lr models using crown scorch and duff consumption as predictors since varner et al 2007 fit a full model and then followed standard model reductions procedures to develop a final model that only includes these two significant variables we set the sampsize parameter to select 10 live and dead trees for each classification tree variable importance was determined using the varimpplot function in the randomforest package in rf models variable importance is determined by calculating the mean decrease in accuracy when a variable is removed from the model by permuting the oob data liaw and wiener 2002 we used the r package pdp to plot the partial dependence functions greenwell 2017 partial dependence functions plot the overall estimated change in the probability of mortality as a predictor varies over its distribution goldstein et al 2015 2 4 cross validation we used repeated 5 fold cross validation to compare rf and lr models on the original data the data were randomly grouped into five equally sized subsets both lr and rf models were fit to four groups the training data sets and used to predict the data in the one group not used in model fitting the test data set the lr models used a threshold probability of 0 5 to determine mortality while the rf models used the majority vote of classification trees this process was repeated such that each group was used once as a test data set for each model that was fit we calculated the roc curve and subsequent auc using the roc and auc functions in the r package proc robin et al 2011 probabilities for the rf models used to calculate the roc curve were based on proportion of votes of the classification trees the cross validation was repeated ten times with new random subsets assigned after each repetition we used the createfolds function in the r package caret to subset the data for each repetition kuhn 2008 3 results 3 1 simulated data effects of class imbalance increasing the class imbalance had a striking effect on the lr post fire longleaf pine mortality models fig 1 a at the lowest mortality rate sensitivity was low and specificity was high as the lr models predicted live trees with high accuracy and dead trees with low accuracy logistic regression models trained with balanced classes 50 mortality had average sensitivity rates of 0 83 and average specificity rates of 0 80 at higher mortality rates sensitivity was high and specificity was low in contrast the rf models had more consistent sensitivity and specificity rates than the lr models fig 1b average accuracy for the rf models ranged from 0 85 0 87 for sensitivity and from 0 79 0 81 for specificity 3 2 original data variable importance to predict tree mortality the rf model trained on the original longleaf pine data from varner et al 2007 provided additional insights into variable importance for predicting post fire tree mortality in agreement with the lr model duff consumption was the most important predictor of post fire tree mortality in long unburned longleaf pine stands for the rf model fig 2 additionally the rf model showed that crown volume scorched and pre fire duff depth were also important positive predictors of fire induced tree mortality all other predictors i e dbh char height scorch height and pre fire litter depth in the model had little to no impact on model accuracy the partial dependence plots showed that increasing duff consumption increased the average probability of tree mortality in the model from approximately 0 25 to 0 6 over the range of 0 100 duff consumption fig 3 a crown scorch also increased the probability of tree mortality from approximately 0 3 to 0 5 over the range of 0 100 scorch fig 3b although pre fire duff depth was nearly as important as fire caused crown scorch the partial dependence plot of duff depth on the probability of tree mortality was mostly flat with a slight increase in the probability of about 0 05 for trees with duff depths 8 cm fig 3c the combined partial dependence of duff consumption and crown scorch shows that trees with high scorch and high duff consumption had a higher probability of mortality than trees with high scorch or high duff consumption alone fig 4 a likewise the combination of a thick pre fire duff layer and high duff consumption had high probability of mortality fig 4b partial dependence plots for pre fire duff and crown scorch showed minimal increases in mortality with increases of both predictor variables fig 4c the 5 fold cross validation of the lr and rf models fit to the original data from varner et al 2007 showed similar results to the simulation data at the lowest mortality level 10 the lr models had an average sensitivity of 0 32 and average specificity of 0 99 fig 5 the rf models were more consistent with average sensitivity of 0 70 and average specificity of 0 80 fig 5 the auc values from the roc curves were similar for both model types with an average auc of 0 87 for lr and 0 85 for rf fig 5 4 discussion traditional post fire tree mortality lr models trained with data containing heavily imbalanced response classes can severely under predict the minority class in most prescribed fire cases dead trees these results are consistent with the findings in other disciplines that use lr to model binary outcomes such as disease diagnostic tests in medical fields alberg et al 2004 to our knowledge no studies in the post fire tree mortality literature have specifically dealt with the problem of imbalance classes on the training data of lr models all of the current fire modeling tools available to practitioners rely on lr for the prediction of tree mortality it is likely that the class imbalance problem is a major contributor to the poor predictive performance observed in tree mortality models validated in the literature grayson et al 2017 ganio and progar 2017 hood and lutes 2017 kane et al 2017a in our study we show that balanced rf models can be a potential solution to the class imbalance problem in post fire tree mortality models king and zeng 2001 proposed that the class imbalance problem can be mitigated during the data collection stage of a study they suggest using an endogenous stratified sampling strategy as a more efficient sampling design for models with rare events for example if post fire tree mortality is low collect all or a subset of dead tree observations and then a random equal sample of live tree observations this sampling strategy not only solves the class imbalance issue but can also save on resources for data collection king and zeng 2001 hood et al 2010 used a slightly different sampling approach that resulted in approximately equal number of live and dead trees to develop lr mortality models for california conifers following wildfire they sampled trees across a matrix of low to high crown and bole injury ranges for different tree sizes and species targeting approximately 30 sample trees within each combination of species size class crown injury class and bole injury class using 10 fold cross validation hood et al 2010 evaluated the accuracy of their models and found false positive and negative rates varied but all were higher than 0 6 and most were higher than 0 7 although hood et al 2010 validated their models with data not used in the model fitting process using cross validation as we did with ours they note that the data are still from the same fires and ideally the models should be tested on new data from fires on separate sites grayson et al 2017 however included the models from hood et al 2010 in their validation of models in the literature on a new data set and found that they were not among the best fitting models this might suggest that one or more additional predictors are missing to extend their applicability to other geographic areas or for different forest conditions e g predictors incorporating spatial dispersion or competition random forest models may be a better option in predicting new data due to the ability to incorporate a large number of predictor variables studies and model development that require pre fire measures of the trees or local fuels that may be modified by the fire as with pre fire duff depth in the longleaf pine data set would complicate the endogenous stratification approach but extensive pre fire measures of these conditions or modeled a priori relationships could be used to ameliorate this issue in their original study using lr varner et al 2007 found that the best predictors of individual mortality of longleaf pine were the percent of duff consumed in the fire and the percent crown volume scorched with scorch only significant in the dry duff moisture treatment post fire tree mortality was significantly higher in the dry duff moisture treatment than any other treatment varner et al 2007 duff consumption was six times greater in the dry duff moisture treatment than in the wet treatment and three times greater than in the moist treatment varner et al 2007 as with many prescribed fire studies overall tree mortality was low with mean mortality rates of 0 5 3 0 and 20 5 for the wet moist and dry treatments respectively the original longleaf pine mortality data had a class imbalance of 400 live trees to 43 dead trees as a result the cross validated lr model using a threshold of 0 5 performed poorly at predicting dead trees low sensitivity and predicted live trees with high accuracy high specificity several studies suggest that a different threshold value should be used to accommodate for the differences in sensitivity and specificity based on management objectives hood et al 2010 ganio and progar 2017 grayson et al 2017 cansler et al 2019 the fact that the auc values of both lr and rf models were nearly identical indicates that the potential discriminatory ability of both models is similar and that adjusting the threshold value of the lr models could yield similar accuracy to the rf model as adjusting the threshold does not affect the auc this solution as our study illustrates sidesteps an important point the mortality probabilities estimated by lr are likely to be biased we suggest using balanced rf as a better solution as there is no need to specify a single threshold criterion by default rf models use the majority vote of each classification tree in the forest to determine the predicted outcome the proportion of votes in a rf model can also be used in the same manner as a threshold probability in lr models should management applications require a different decision criterion than the majority random forest models have been shown to provide exceptional predictive performance breiman 2001a b prasad et al 2006 rodriguez galiano et al 2012 for example rodriguez galiano et al 2012 found that rf correctly classified remotely sensed land cover data with an accuracy of 92 random forest models can also effectively predict fire impacts across large landscapes including fire severity and post fire forest structure kane et al 2015a b random forest models also have several appealing statistical qualities in that they do not make any distributional assumptions about the data they can handle a high number of predictor variables and they are not sensitive to missing values cutler et al 2007 additionally rf models can evaluate more than two classes as well as continuous response variables although multinomial lr can be used to model more than two response classes and linear regression can be used to model continuous response variables it is still often necessary to reduce the dimensionality of the data in lr and other traditional statistical methods especially if there are high correlations among predictor variables breiman 2001b argues that by reducing the dimensionality of the data one also reduces potentially valuable information for prediction by including the full suite of predictors in our rf model we identified a relationship with pre fire duff depth that was not evident in the lr model of varner et al 2007 past and future studies on post fire tree mortality may benefit by using rf and including additional potential predictors as well as considering model performance for continuous responses such as growth or estimates of vigor instead of coarse binary responses of live or dead one of the criticisms of rf models is that they are a black box with the model using complex and largely unknown mechanisms to produce predictions from the predictor variables breiman 2001b partial dependence functions can help with some of the interpretation but rf models are generally poor at interpretability and are not a tool to be used for hypothesis testing breiman 2001b cutler et al 2007 random forest models do not generate p values nor estimate confidence intervals which may be a drawback for some users however cutler et al 2007 suggest that the results of rf models can be used as inputs to more traditional multivariate statistical techniques regardless because predicting post fire tree mortality is a classification problem accurate prediction is more important for many applications than interpretability decision support tools designed to assist land managers with predicting fire caused tree mortality such as the software program first order fire effects model fofem lutes 2018 may improve by incorporating balanced rf models in future versions there are several potential benefits for land managers including the ability to enter new data and have the model update predictions to improve local estimates for example rf could potentially allow users to add new predictors to the model without the need to check that all the assumptions of lr are met and without the need to explicitly state interactive effects future decision support tools could therefore learn to provide more accurate predictions specific to different environments at the same time the data that are provided by the users can be sent to the researchers that develop the software for evaluation an application such as this could greatly increase our ability to rapidly incorporate new data into predictive modeling systems and increase our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of fire induced tree mortality hood et al 2018 author contributions

24958,whole tree harvesting wth following final felling of productive forests is increasingly promoted as a method to extract biomass for energy purposes despite its importance there is a limited number of experimental studies investigating the impacts of wth on forest ecosystem sustainability modelling studies have previously been carried out to complement and explain empirical observations from four long term wth experiments in sweden the literature shows a significant discrepancy between these studies and open questions remain as to the fate of the base cations that are not removed in the absence of wth this study uses the integrated ecosystem model forsafe which simulate a forest ecosystem s biogeochemical processes and the feedbacks between these processes to trace the fate of base cations for the said four long term wth experiments the study shows that the model generally captures the observed effects of wth on the stocks of base cations in the biomass and in the soil the modelled results were also used to map how the base cations removed through wth would otherwise if left at the site have been distributed in the ecosystem the results indicate that the soil organic pool may be more important to the long term base cation balance than the exchangeable pool and should receive more attention in future research keywords forest nutrition base cation cycling acidification forsafe 1 introduction eu s target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80 95 by 2050 relative to the level of 1990 european commission 2012 means substantially increased demand of renewable energy from forests accordingly whole tree harvesting wth has been increasing in sweden over the last decades wth here defined as harvesting of stems branches and tops are presently performed on 23 35 of the clear cuts swedish forest agency 2016 and this fraction is expected to continue to increase börjesson et al 2017 management practices performed to optimize one ecosystem service may occur at the expense of another ecosystem service gamfeldt et al 2013 potential conflicts between wth and the swedish environmental objectives were highlighted in a synthesis paper by de jong et al 2017 where the highest sustainable wth level was estimated to 50 of the total harvested area negative effects on biodiversity and acidification were identified as the limiting factors although negative effects on base cation status and acidification have been presented both in evaluation of experiments brandtberg and olsson 2012 zetterberg et al 2013 and in modelling exercises using profile akselsson et al 2007 2018 and magic zetterberg et al 2014 2016 there is a discrepancy in the results with larger effects according to the models than in the measurements zetterberg et al 2016 de jong et al 2017 this introduces uncertainties in the decision support to be used for policy makers within the sustainable forestry field the lack of dynamics in these models has been suggested as a potential explanation for this discrepancy zetterberg et al 2016 paré and thiffault 2016 for example feedback mechanisms between soil chemistry tree growth weathering and leaching in this study the dynamic model forsafe wallman et al 2005 belyazid et al 2006 which couples process descriptions of tree growth decomposition soil processes and hydrology was applied to four experimental sites in sweden where long term effects of wth have been studied for 40 years brandtberg and olsson 2012 the overarching aim was to increase the understanding of processes and feedback mechanisms in the soil after wth to be able to better quantify how base cation losses after whole tree harvesting are distributed between soil runoff water and biomass in different time scales the objectives were to investigate if the forsafe model captures the measured effects in soil soil water and biomass after wth to use the model to describe processes feedbacks and the base cation dynamics in soil biomass and runoff water during the course of one forest generation after wth 2 material and methods 2 1 site description and data 2 1 1 study sites the four study sites constitute a long term experiment established in the mid 70 s to investigate the impact of whole tree harvesting on tree growth and soil status björkroth and rosén 1977 the sites were clear cut between 1974 76 using different harvest intensities the treatments considered in this study were i conventional harvest ch where only stems were harvested and ii whole tree harvest wth where stems branches and needles were harvested each treatment was repeated in four blocks at each site with each block measuring 20 m x 20 m in size two of the sites tönnersjöheden and kosta are located in the nemoral boreal climate zone of southern sweden whereas the other two sites lövliden and lund are in the boreal zone of northern sweden tönnersjöheden is located near the west coast and receives higher precipitation and deposition than the other three sites all sites are on glacial till except for lund which is on an alluvial deposit after clear cut and patch scarification two of the sites tönnersjöheden and lövliden were planted with norway spruce picea abies and two kosta and lund with scots pine pinus sylvestris site data is described in more detail in olsson et al 1996 land use history for three of the sites is described in zetterberg et al 2013 lund which was not included in the study by zetterberg et al was a naturally regenerated scots pine forest prior to clear felling in 1974 the stand is on a sandy alluvial deposit next to the vindeln river the soil is exceptionally well drained and nutrient poor the survival rate of seedlings after planting was very low with only around 20 survival after 15 years egnell and leijon 1999 and replacement was allowed through natural regeneration 2 1 2 sampling procedure and soil analyses soil samples were taken from 70 cm deep soil pits excavated in july 2016 within each plot at each site a soil pit was dug approximately 1 m from the edge samples were collected from each visibly distinct horizon usually four samples in total o a b and c horizons but occasionally also one sample from a bc horizon soils were dried and sieved and subsequently analysed for texture total element content exchangeable cations c and n content soil density and hydrological parameters field capacity wilting point and the limit for potential evapotranspiration were calculated from organic matter content and texture according to balland et al 2008 mineral surface area was calculated from soil texture according to warfvinge and sverdrup 1995 cat ion exchange capacity cec was calculated as the net charge of all exchangeable cat ions al3 h ca2 mg2 k na fe and mn and the base saturation bs was calculated as the proportion of biologically active base cations ca2 mg2 and k of the total cec the mineralogy was calculated from the total element content using the a2m model posch and kurz 2007 data from previous studies was also used to evaluate model performance this included tree biomass data which has been regularly estimated at each site since 1990 egnell and leijon 1999 zetterberg et al 2016 with the exception of lund where tree biomass was only surveyed once concentrations of base cations in tree tissue björkroth and rosén 1977 zetterberg et al 2016 soil water chemistry data which was regularly sampled during 2003 2005 and 2008 2010 only the former period at lund zetterberg et al 2013 and soil chemistry data which was sampled to a depth of 20 cm on three different occasions olsson et al 1996 brandtberg and olsson 2012 zetterberg et al 2013 2 1 3 deposition and climate deposition was given to the model as annual input and was distributed proportionally to the precipitation deposition sequences for so4 2 no3 and nh4 were constructed by combining modelled scenarios and measured deposition for cl ca2 mg2 k and na hindcasted and forecasted deposition were assumed equal to the average contemporary deposition details on the calculations of deposition sequences and meteorological time series can be found in the appendix 2 2 model description and set up 2 2 1 forsafe forsafe is a forest ecosystem model coupling processes of tree growth decomposition weathering exchange processes in soils and hydrology it was originally conceived as a coupling between the core process algorithms of four separate models the tree growth model pnet aber and federer 1992 the soil chemistry model safe alveteg 1998 the decomposition model decomp wallman et al 2005 walse et al 1998 and the hydrology model pulse lindström and gardelin 1992 the model domain is a 1d soil column including the rooting zone of the soil the organic and mineral soil layers and the above ground tree biomass forsafe simulates the response of forest ecosystems to environmental changes and management practices and includes processes such as photosynthesis carbon and nutrient allocation nutrient uptake ion exchange decomposition weathering leaching evapotranspiration and runoff elements included in forsafe are n c ca2 mg2 k na cl h al so4 2 these elements are distributed between different stores in the model biomass sap wood foliage and fine roots deadwood soil organic material exchangeable pools and soil solution all model parameters are pre defined by the user with the exception of the initial base saturation and the gapon coefficients for ion exchange for each soil layer which are automatically calibrated to match observed values of base saturations alveteg 1998 in this study forsafe3 0 which runs on a daily time step was used yu et al 2016 2 2 2 management scenarios in forsafe trees consist of three biomass compartments needles fine roots and wood with wood including stem bark branches stumps and coarse roots 2 mm for the ch scenario it was assumed that 60 of the wood was removed from the site after clear cut for the wth scenario it was assumed that 80 of the wood and 95 of the needles were removed zetterberg et al 2013 for lund 15 of the stand was cut each year between 1979 and 1988 in the simulations to simulate the high mortality for seedlings at the site at tönnersjöheden a thinning was performed in 2004 when 20 of the biomass was cut and only stems were harvested at both ch and wth plots at kosta two thinnings were performed during the first in the year 2000 40 of the biomass on ch plots and 25 of the biomass at wth plots was cut and the original treatment was repeated with ch on ch plots and wth on wth plots during the second thinning in 2010 20 of the biomass was cut and only stems were harvested at both ch and wth plots at lövliden and lund no thinnings have yet been performed 2 2 3 site specific adjustments of model parameters while the model parameters of forsafe are normally not adjusted for individual sites some site specific adjustments were however still necessary to make in this study these were to account for the slow initial tree growth on the northern sites the photosynthesis rate was reduced by 45 by decreasing the parameter amaxfrac from 0 76 to 0 42 the parameters fraction of luxury uptake regulating the maximum concentration of nutrients in needles were altered so that they would match base cation concentrations in tissue samples from trees at the specific sites table a3 the parameters average concentration in wood were altered so that simulated wood base cation concentrations would match tissue samples from all woody biomass compartments stem bark branches stumps and coarse roots this change was necessary as forsafe aggregates all those compartments into one single representation of woody biomass table a3 the texture at lund was changed so that all silt was replaced with sand in the pedotransfer functions balland et al 2008 as the calculated hydrological properties did not reflect the well drained soil at lund the lund soil is a sorted alluvial soil with a predominant grain size in the coarse silt and fine sand fractions 2 2 4 model implementation and analyses of the results for the two southern sites forsafe was run from the point in time when the stand clear cut in the 1970 s was established 1904 for tönnersjöheden and 1874 for kosta for the two northern sites which had not previously been clear cut forsafe was run from year 1900 tree species parameters for the spruce sites were taken from zanchi et al 2014 for the pine sites some of the parameters specific to scots pine were drawn from previous studies table a2 details on model initialization and parameterization can be found in the appendix the model was ran separately for each of the 32 plots 4 ch 4 wth 4 sites to compare the modelled effects from ch and wth on exchangeable bc and soil water bc concentrations with observations the statistical analyses in zetterberg et al 2013 2016 were repeated on modelled data for soil water bc concentrations a mixed model anova was used testing the effects of site season and treatment i e harvesting intensity including interaction terms between all three factors the test was separately performed for the two time periods of 2003 2005 and 2008 2010 average values over each year and season for exchangeable bc modelled values were averaged over the three years when samples had been previously taken 1991 2002 and 2012 effects of site time and treatment were tested with the mixed model including interaction terms between all three factors furthermore the statistical analyses on observed data was also repeated for the lumped parameter bc as zetterberg et al 2013 2016 had only analyzed effects on individual base cations 2 2 5 base cation tracing to investigate patterns potentially hidden by spatial variability additional model runs were also set up using the average values from all four ch plots at each site the arithmetic means were then used to define layer thickness soil texture organic matter content cec bs soil density and mineralogy then both the ch and wth scenarios were run separately these runs were used to trace the fate of base cations contained in harvest residues left on sites in forsafe base cations can be contained in five different pools deadwood bcdead som including soil microbial biomass bcsom biomass bcbio exchangeable bc bcex and soil water bcsw since the amount of base cations momentarily contained in soil water is small in relation to other pools bcsw was neglected in all calculations however at each time step an amount of bc leaves the system through leaching in these calculations the cumulative leaching bcleach is accounted for as a fifth term when tracing the fate of the base cations at each annual time step the difference in size of each bc pool between ch and wth plots was calculated as 1 δ b c p b c p c h b c p w t h where bcp is the total amount of base cations in pool p and δbcp is the difference in pool size between ch and wth harvesting the proportion of the whole base cation difference between ch and wth attributable to pool p φbcp is then calculated as 2 φ b c p δ b c p δ b c h 100 where δbch is the total difference in bc between ch and wth harvesting immediately after clear cut 3 results 3 1 effects from whole tree harvesting 3 1 1 tree biomass at all four sites observed biomass was on average higher on ch plots than on wth plots fig 1 the effect was smallest at lund with on average 6 higher biomass on ch plots and largest at kosta with on average 36 higher biomass on ch plots just before the first thinning 25 years after clear cut the difference between ch and wth plots was significant at tönnersjöheden and kosta p 0 05 but not significant at lund and lövliden in the latter case because of large between plot variability biomass growth was reasonably well modelled in forsafe although there was a tendency of a too fast initial growth rate at kosta and lövliden fig 1 the negative effects of slower tree growth on wth plots were also captured by the model modelled biomass was significantly higher on ch than on wth plots at tönnersjöheden kosta and lövliden but not at lund table 1 3 1 2 base cations in soil water in the statistical analysis on observed data treatment i e harvesting intensity had a significant effect on bc soil water concentrations for samples taken 2003 2005 but not for the samples taken 2008 2010 although the effect from the interaction term site x treatment was weakly significant the statistical analysis on modelled data showed no significant effect from treatment for any of those two distinct time periods however when analyzing the earlier time period of 1981 1983 approx 5 7 years after clear cut the treatment effect was significant p 0 017 fig 2 table 2 the implication of these results is that soil water bc concentrations were likely higher on ch plots than on wth plots for the first decades after clear cut and thus leaching was an important sink for base cations on ch plots relative to wth plots during this time period at some point in time this effect gradually subsided and 35 years after clear cut only small differences remained observations suggest that this shift happened 30 years after clear cut while it occurred about 10 years earlier in the model simulations 3 1 3 exchangeable base cations regarding the store of bcex organic layer upper 20 cm of the mineral soil previous studies have demonstrated that a bcex tended to decrease during the period 15 to 37 years after clear cut and b bcex was significantly higher at ch plots than at wth plots 15 years after clear cut but two decades later the differences were no longer significant brandtberg and olsson 2012 zetterberg et al 2013 the lund site however deviated from this pattern with increasing bcex and an increasing difference in bcex between ch and wth plots was observed fig 3 the model in general predicted small effects from wth on bcex at least in comparison with the plot to plot variability the only site that displayed a clear but temporary effect on bcex was tönnersjöheden furthermore with the exception of lund modelled bcex tended to be higher than previously observed especially for lövliden where there was almost no overlap between the intervals covered by modelled and previously observed bcex fig 4 the observed decreasing difference in bcex between ch and wth plots was not captured in the modelled results which is reflected in the non significant effect from the interaction term site x treatment table 3 one possible reason for the discrepancies between modelled and observed bcex is the large spatial variability between plots in the samples to which forsafe was calibrated for all sites except tönnersjöheden the intra site variability in 2016 the year to which the modelled bcex was calibrated was much larger than on previous sampling occasions fig 3 differences between modelled and previously measured bcex can therefore possibly be attributed to differences in sampling procedures 3 1 4 summary tree growth curves were reasonably well modelled in forsafe as well as the negative effects from wth forsafe simulations agreed with the observations that there was an initial effect from harvesting intensity on soil water bc concentrations and by implication leaching but that this effect subsided with time however the timing of this shift differed between observations and simulations as observations indicated that differences remained up to 30 years after clear cut while the modelled effect from harvesting intensity lasted for 20 years for exchangeable bc forsafe was not able to reproduce the observed the different dynamics between ch and wth plots one reason for this is that the between plot variability of the 2016 samples to which forsafe was calibrated exceeds the effect from wth on bcex pools this may in turn may be an artifact from the sampling procedure 3 2 tracing base cations 3 2 1 distribution of base cations between pools in forsafe harvest residues left on site after conventional harvesting contain base cations which with time will be redistributed to tree biomass stored in the soil as exchangeable base cations or in the soil organic matter or leave the ecosystem through leaching in forsafe woody residue i e branches and stumps is represented as deadwood while needles and fine roots are directly distributed to the four litter quality classes of the som the modelled difference in total bc left on site after clear cut between ch and wth plots δbch was 1 31 eq m2 for tönnersjöheden 1 12 eq m2 for kosta 1 38 eq m2 for lövliden and 0 6 eq m2 for lund corresponding estimates of the actual difference between ch and wth plots were 1 12 1 15 1 44 and 0 30 eq m2 respectively björkroth and rosén 1977 zetterberg et al 2013 fig 4 table 4 demonstrate how these extra base cations are distributed between bcdead bcsom bcbio bcex and bcleach the only term possible to evaluate against observations is δbcbio which can be estimated from observed biomass stem bark branches needles and roots and bc concentrations in samples from tree tissues the modelled re distribution of bc to biomass agreed exceptionally well with observed data except for tönnersjöheden where modelled δbcbio was significantly higher than observed table 4 furthermore the model could now clearly reproduce the subsiding effect from wth on bcex at tönnersjöheden and lövliden as well as the opposing pattern at lund 3 2 2 summary loss of bc through leaching was approximately equally important at all four sites with δbcleach equaling 35 45 after 45 years most of the extra leaching from ch plots occurred during the first decade after clear cut and for the two northern sites there was no increase at all in δbcleach after 20 years following clear cut a substantial share of base cations is contained in som δbcsom was approximately constant at 20 30 for the first 45 years after clear cut at all four sites the rapid decrease in δbcex observed at tönnersjöheden lövliden and kosta zetterberg et al 2013 was captured by forsafe for the two former sites but not for kosta for lund δbcex increased with time 20 45 years after clear cut which is in accordance with observations fig 4 with the exception of lund δbcbio grew steadily throughout the first 45 years after clear cut note that for the first thinning at kosta in 2000 the original treatment was repeated with a larger harvest of biomass from wth plots since harvested biomass is included in the biomass term this temporarily decreased bc in biomass on ch plots relative to wth plots 4 discussion 4 1 forsafe background and assumptions forsafe is a forest ecosystem model including biological geochemical and hydrological processes it is a unique model in that it aims to simultaneously simulate the biogeochemical cycles of several elements and their interdependencies rather than exclusively focusing on ecosystem components regardless of ecosystem the elemental biogeochemical cycles and their interactions are assumed to be governed by the same processes in response to the microclimatic and chemical environmental containing their different stages such as soil solution chemistry for the aqueous soil phase this requires high resolution in process descriptions but it allows the model to address feedback mechanisms and non linear responses and reduces the need for parameter calibration subsequently forsafe is better suited and intended to reproduce broader behavioral patterns in response to anthropogenic changes such as forest cutting or changes in climate and less suited to exactly replicating reality where the model fails to reproduce observed patterns it is able to highlight the processes that are not well described by the model the long term whole tree harvest experiments initiated in the 1970 s have been the subject of numerous studies in this study our aim was to investigate if the key results in these studies could be reproduced by the forest ecosystem model forsafe a tree growth is significantly faster after ch than after wth egnell and leijon 1999 egnell and valinger 2003 egnell 2011 b wth effects on soil water bc concentrations were ambiguous or non significant 28 34 years after clear cut zetterberg et al 2013 c wth had significant negative effects on the store of exchangeable bc 15 years after clear cut however this effect had diminished or disappeared after another ten years brandtberg and olsson 2012 zetterberg et al 2013 when ran on individual plots the results from forsafe agreed well with a fig 1 and fairly well with b fig 2 however the model did not reproduce differences in the dynamics of bcex between ch and wth plots fig 3 when forsafe instead was used to simulate ch and wth with identical input data so that the modelled response to harvest intensity is not obscured by plot to plot variability the results were in agreement with c as well fig 4 while it has been hypothesized that the two effects are related i e that the initially larger bcex stores on ch plots becomes depleted by faster tree growth and higher uptake brandtberg and olsson 2012 it is still not fully understood how base cations contained in harvest residues are distributed between trees soil and water over time this is partly because leaching mainly occurred during the first decade after clear cut before any soil water samples were collected zetterberg et al 2016 quantified the fluxes of base cations following ch and wth respectively for the long term experiments studied here using the geochemical acidification model magic however the model exaggerated the soil ca2 losses during the development of the new tree stand and did not reproduce the rapid diminishing differences between ch and wth the authors attributed this to the lack of biological feedback mechanisms in magic or alternatively imperfect description of processes such as the non dynamic pool of organic matter 4 2 uncertainties and limitations acknowledging the complexity of the biochemical cycles in a forest ecosystem the descriptions of most processes in forsafe are of course simplified furthermore uncertainties in the sampling processes affect the results some of the important error sources in this study were since forsafe assumes active base cation uptake modelled tissue concentrations of base cations were the same on ch and wth plots in reality unless it is a limiting nutrient base cation uptake is likely to be passive knecht göransson 2004 which should give higher needle concentrations of bc on ch plots where more base cations are available a higher bc concentration in needle tissue on ch plots was indeed confirmed at tönnersjöheden but none of the other sites olsson unpublished data this was also the reason why the parameters fraction of luxury uptake and average concentration in wood had to be calibrated to observations as running the model with the initial set of parameters resulted in much too high needle base cation concentrations the modelled tree growth was slightly too fast fig 1 and especially the canopy growth the modelled canopy had reached full size after 15 years on southern sites and 23 years on northern sites in contrast observations indicated that the canopy was still growing after 45 years of development of the new stand furthermore the amaxfrac parameter was decreased for the two northern sites to account for the very slow initial growth the slower tree growth in the north may be due to both low nitrogen availability tamm 2012 and negative effects from sub zero ambient air temperatures in late spring and early autumn on photosynthesis bergh et al 1998 soil samples were collected from one soil pit per plot in contrast to earlier studies where a total of 25 samples per plot were collected olsson et al 1996 however previous soil sampling only included the upper 20 cm whereas forsafe requires soil samples representing the entire rooting zone this sampling procedure is more intrusive and it was not practically possible to better represent the spatial variability within each plot this is likely the cause for the much larger among plot variability in modelled bcex compared to previous observations fig 3 4 3 modelled biogeochemical process 4 3 1 tree growth tree growth the average modelled effects from wth on tree growth was correctly simulated in forsafe in broader terms although the variability among sites was smaller compared to observations table 1 in the forsafe simulations trees on ch plots grew faster because they had access to more nitrogen increasing the n fraction of foliage which increases the photosynthesis rates aber et al 1996 a higher n content in needles on ch plots than on wth plots was confirmed for tissue samples taken 8 10 years after clear cut however 16 18 years after clear cut no significant differences in n content remained olsson et al 2000 egnell 2011 in general forsafe predicted 1 a larger effect on tree growth from wth on pine stands than on spruce stands comparing tönnersjöheden and kosta this reflected the higher nitrogen use efficiency of pine niinemets 2002 2 a larger effect of wth on tree growth in relative terms on northern than on southern sites comparing tönnersjöheden and lövliden this is because the nitrogen dose added as harvest residues is much larger relative to deposition at the northern sites whereas n contained in harvest residues at tönnersjöheden corresponded to 14 years of n deposition it corresponded to more than 60 years of deposition and fixation at lövliden the lund site however was an obvious exception to these rules as it despite being a northern pine stand displayed the smallest effect from wth in forsafe the reason for this was that trees at lund were strictly nitrogen limited on both ch and wth plots i e the n concentrations in needles were at the lower critical level for pine of 12 mg n g dw the modelled results agreed with observations and egnell and leijon 1999 hypothesized that the small effect on tree growth at lund was due to the ability of nutrient poor pine stands to compensate for nitrogen deficits by increased fixation a mechanism that forsafe was not able to capture 4 3 2 ion exchange brandtberg and olsson 2012 and zetterberg et al 2013 both reported that differences in bcex between ch and wth plots decreased with time at tönnersjöheden lövliden and kosta this trend was reproduced by forsafe for two of the sites tönnersjöheden and lövliden for kosta the modelled δbcex remained nearly constant until 45 years after clear cut and demands from higher growth rates on ch plots were instead supported by release of bc from decomposing deadwood and som the reasons for this were mainly a the addition of c a 0 2 eq ha additional base cations on ch plots after the thinning in 2000 as the harvesting treatment was repeated and b the c a 50 higher cec at kosta than at tönnersjöheden and lövliden the latter may be an artifact from the sampling procedure previous studies did report higher cec in the organic layer for kosta but the total cec down to 20 cm was not higher at kosta than at the other sites zetterberg et al 2013 in forsafe decreasing δbcex was mainly driven by faster tree growth and higher bc uptake on ch plots the hypothesis that tree growth drives these changes is supported by both observations fig 3 and forsafe simulations fig 4 from the fourth site lund there patterns were reversed with an increasing δbcex and a decreasing δbcbio with time 4 3 3 leaching of the bc added as harvest residues on ch plots between 35 kosta and 45 lövliden and lund had been lost through leaching after 45 years fig 4 most of the leaching losses occurred during the first decade after clear cut associated with leaching of no3 in the forsafe simulations half of the total extra leaching of base cations from ch plots up until 45 years after clear cut occurred during the first 6 7 years at the northern sites and during the first 11 years at the two southern sites 4 4 implications effects from whole tree harvesting the cost of whole tree harvesting can be divided into short term and long term impacts on trees soil and runoff water chemistry short term impacts can be defined as effects limited to one rotation period and include a loss in tree growth and lowered buffering capacity of runoff due to reduced leaching of base cations long term impacts can be defined as persistent effects on soil status and include permanent reductions in the bc stocks in the soil consisting of exchangeable base cations and base cations contained in recalcitrant organic matter in the forsafe simulations the most common fate for the base cations left in harvest residues after 40 years of development of the new stand was loss by leaching consistently throughout the four study sites however this is not necessarily to say that negative effects on the quality of runoff water should always be the major concern when evaluating effects of harvest practices losses of bc to runoff may be tolerable as long as the buffering capacity is sufficient to withstand acid episodes a deep saturated zone below the rooting zone will generally provide for a sufficient buffering capacity for the draining stream network erlandsson et al 2016 negative effects on tree growth from wth have been previously documented on these sites egnell and leijon 1999 egnell and valinger 2003 egnell 2011 and were also largely correctly captured in forsafe fig 1 long term depletion of soil bc stocks may be more serious as it weakens the soil s potential to sustain the biochemical base cation cycle much attention has been focused on the store of exchangeable base cations on which long term effects from wth appears limited as suggested both by observations and models instead the results from this study suggest that the effects from wth on som pools of base cations are both larger and more persistent than those on the exchangeable store acknowledgments the authors wish to express their gratitude for the financial support granted by the swedish energy agency as well as the project biodiversity and ecosystem services in a

timrilt 2014 2015 per erik karlsson pers comm to account for the effect of tree size on dd the calculated dd was multiplied with a factor that equaled zero directly after clear cut and increased linearly to reach a value of one 30 years after clear cut the calculated ddf was then applied to the whole time series to calculated dd from wd the modelled deposition of so4 2 no3 and nh4 pre 1996 and post 2015 was then downscaled to match the measured deposition at timrilt the modelled deposition time series was then multiplied with a coefficient equal to the ratio between the measured deposition at timrilt 1996 2015 and the modelled deposition for the same period downscaling was done separately for wet and dry deposition for kosta deposition time series were calculated with a similar method however for kosta the measured deposition from two different swethro sites was used the nearest site attsjö had measured deposition 1997 2001 to expand time series of observed

the observed values from sampling in 2016 to establish the initial conditions the model was run under constant climate and deposition scenarios for a given period of time the length of the initialization period was estimated from knowledge of the land use history where shorter period was chosen for the southern sites and especially for tönnersjöheden which was not forested prior to the 1900 s for the northern sites which were pristine forests before clear cutting in the 1970 s longer initialization periods were used and especially for lövliden where a longer initialization period was required to build up the n store in the soil to match the observed table a1 table a4 
24958,whole tree harvesting wth following final felling of productive forests is increasingly promoted as a method to extract biomass for energy purposes despite its importance there is a limited number of experimental studies investigating the impacts of wth on forest ecosystem sustainability modelling studies have previously been carried out to complement and explain empirical observations from four long term wth experiments in sweden the literature shows a significant discrepancy between these studies and open questions remain as to the fate of the base cations that are not removed in the absence of wth this study uses the integrated ecosystem model forsafe which simulate a forest ecosystem s biogeochemical processes and the feedbacks between these processes to trace the fate of base cations for the said four long term wth experiments the study shows that the model generally captures the observed effects of wth on the stocks of base cations in the biomass and in the soil the modelled results were also used to map how the base cations removed through wth would otherwise if left at the site have been distributed in the ecosystem the results indicate that the soil organic pool may be more important to the long term base cation balance than the exchangeable pool and should receive more attention in future research keywords forest nutrition base cation cycling

jong et al 2017 where the highest sustainable wth level was estimated to 50 of the total harvested area negative effects on biodiversity and acidification were identified as the limiting factors although negative effects on base cation status and acidification have been presented both in evaluation of experiments brandtberg and olsson 2012 zetterberg et al 2013 and in modelling exercises using profile akselsson et al 2007 2018 and magic zetterberg et al 2014 2016 there is a discrepancy in the results with larger effects according to the models than in the measurements zetterberg et al

sweden where long term effects of wth have been studied for 40 years brandtberg and olsson 2012 the overarching aim was to increase the understanding of processes and feedback mechanisms in the soil after wth to be able to better quantify how base cation losses after whole tree harvesting are distributed between soil runoff water and biomass in different time scales the objectives were to investigate if the forsafe model captures the measured effects in soil soil water and biomass after wth to use the model to describe processes feedbacks and the base cation dynamics in soil biomass and runoff water during the course of one forest generation after wth 2 material and methods 2 1 site description and data 2 1 1 study sites the four study sites constitute a long term experiment established in the mid 70 s to investigate the impact of whole tree harvesting on tree growth and soil status björkroth and rosén 1977 the sites were clear cut between 1974 76 using different harvest intensities the treatments considered in this study were i conventional harvest ch where only stems were harvested and ii whole tree harvest wth where stems branches and needles were harvested each treatment was repeated in four blocks at each site with each block measuring 20 m x 20 m in size two of the sites tönnersjöheden and kosta are located in the nemoral boreal climate zone of southern sweden whereas the other two sites lövliden and lund are in the boreal zone of northern sweden tönnersjöheden is located near the west coast and receives higher precipitation and deposition than the other three sites all sites are on glacial till except for lund which is on an alluvial deposit after clear cut and patch scarification two of the sites tönnersjöheden and lövliden were planted with norway spruce picea abies and two kosta and lund with scots pine pinus sylvestris site data is described in more detail in olsson et al 1996 land use history for three of the sites is described in zetterberg et al 2013 lund which was not included in the study by zetterberg et al was a naturally regenerated scots pine forest prior to clear felling in 1974 the stand is on a sandy alluvial deposit next to the vindeln river the soil is exceptionally well drained and nutrient poor the survival rate of seedlings after planting was very low with only around 20 survival after 15 years egnell and leijon 1999 and replacement was allowed through natural regeneration 2 1 2 sampling procedure and soil analyses soil samples were taken from 70 cm deep soil pits excavated in july 2016 within each plot at each site a soil pit was dug approximately 1 m from the edge samples were collected from each visibly distinct horizon usually four samples in total o a b and c horizons but occasionally also one sample from a bc horizon soils were dried and sieved and subsequently analysed for texture total element content exchangeable cations c and n content soil density and hydrological parameters field capacity wilting point and the limit for potential evapotranspiration were calculated from organic matter content and texture according to balland et al 2008 mineral surface area was calculated from soil texture according to warfvinge and sverdrup 1995 cat ion exchange capacity cec was calculated as the net charge of all exchangeable cat ions al3 h ca2 mg2 k na fe and mn and the base saturation bs was calculated as the proportion of biologically active base cations ca2 mg2 and k of the total cec the mineralogy was calculated from the total element content using the a2m model posch and kurz 2007 data from previous studies was also used to evaluate model performance this included tree biomass data which has been regularly estimated at each site since 1990 egnell and leijon 1999 zetterberg et al 2016 with the exception of lund where tree biomass was only surveyed once concentrations of base cations in tree tissue björkroth and rosén 1977 zetterberg et al 2016 soil water chemistry data which was regularly sampled during 2003 2005 and 2008 2010 only the former period at lund zetterberg et al 2013 and soil chemistry data which was sampled to a depth of 20 cm on three different occasions olsson et al 1996 brandtberg and olsson 2012 zetterberg et al 2013 2 1 3 deposition and climate deposition was given to the model as annual input and was distributed proportionally to the precipitation deposition sequences for so4 2 no3 and nh4 were constructed by combining modelled scenarios and measured deposition for cl ca2 mg2 k and na hindcasted and forecasted deposition were assumed equal to the average contemporary deposition details on the calculations of deposition sequences and meteorological time series can be found in the appendix 2 2 model description and set up 2 2 1 forsafe forsafe is a forest ecosystem model coupling processes of tree growth decomposition weathering exchange processes in soils and hydrology it was originally conceived as a coupling between the core process algorithms of four separate models the tree growth model pnet aber and federer 1992 the soil chemistry model safe alveteg 1998 the decomposition model decomp wallman et al 2005 walse et al 1998 and the hydrology model pulse lindström and gardelin 1992 the model domain is a 1d soil column including the rooting zone of the soil the organic and mineral soil layers and the above ground tree biomass forsafe simulates the response of forest ecosystems to environmental changes and management practices and includes processes such as photosynthesis carbon and nutrient allocation nutrient uptake ion exchange decomposition weathering leaching evapotranspiration and runoff elements included in forsafe are n c ca2 mg2 k na cl h al so4 2 these elements are distributed between different stores in the model biomass sap wood foliage and fine roots deadwood soil organic material exchangeable pools and soil solution all model parameters are pre defined by the user with the exception of the initial base saturation and the gapon coefficients for ion exchange for each soil layer which are automatically calibrated to match observed values of base saturations alveteg 1998 in this study forsafe3 0 which runs on a daily time step was used yu et al 2016 2 2 2 management scenarios in forsafe trees consist of three biomass compartments needles fine roots and wood with wood including stem bark branches stumps and coarse roots 2 mm for the ch scenario it was assumed that 60 of the wood was removed from the site after clear cut for the wth scenario it was assumed that 80 of the wood and 95 of the needles were removed zetterberg et al 2013 for lund 15 of the stand was cut each year between 1979 and 1988 in the simulations to simulate the high mortality for seedlings at the site at tönnersjöheden a thinning was performed in 2004 when 20 of the biomass was cut and only stems were harvested at both ch and wth plots at kosta two thinnings were performed during the first in the year 2000 40 of the biomass on ch plots and 25 of the biomass at wth plots was cut and the original treatment was repeated with ch on ch plots and wth on wth plots during the second thinning in 2010 20 of the biomass was cut and only stems were harvested at both ch and wth plots at lövliden and lund no thinnings have yet been performed 2 2 3 site specific adjustments of model parameters while the model parameters of forsafe are normally not adjusted for individual sites some site specific adjustments were however still necessary to make in this study these were to account for the slow initial tree growth on the northern sites the photosynthesis rate was reduced by 45 by decreasing the parameter amaxfrac from 0 76 to 0 42 the parameters fraction of luxury uptake regulating the maximum concentration of nutrients in needles were altered so that they would match base cation concentrations in tissue samples from trees at the specific sites table a3 the parameters average concentration in wood were altered so that simulated wood base cation concentrations would match tissue samples from all woody biomass compartments stem bark branches stumps and coarse roots this change was necessary as forsafe aggregates all those compartments into one single representation of woody biomass table a3 the texture at lund was changed so that all silt was replaced with sand in the pedotransfer functions balland et al 2008 as the calculated hydrological properties did not reflect the well drained soil at lund the lund soil is a sorted alluvial soil with a predominant grain size in the coarse silt and fine sand fractions 2 2 4 model implementation and analyses of the results for the two southern sites forsafe was run from the point in time when the stand clear cut in the 1970 s was established 1904 for tönnersjöheden and 1874 for kosta for the two northern sites which had not previously been clear cut forsafe was run from year 1900 tree species parameters for the spruce sites were taken from zanchi et al 2014 for the pine sites some of the parameters specific to scots pine were drawn from previous studies table a2 details on model initialization and parameterization can be found in the appendix the model was ran separately for each of the 32 plots 4 ch 4 wth 4 sites to compare the modelled effects from ch and wth on exchangeable bc and soil water bc concentrations with observations the statistical analyses in zetterberg et al 2013 2016 were repeated on modelled data for soil water bc concentrations a mixed model anova was used testing the effects of site season and treatment i e harvesting intensity including interaction terms between all three factors the test was separately performed for the two time periods of 2003 2005 and 2008 2010 average values over each year and season for exchangeable bc modelled values were averaged over the three years when samples had been previously taken 1991 2002 and 2012 effects of site time and treatment were tested with the mixed model including interaction terms between all three factors furthermore the statistical analyses on observed data was also repeated for the lumped parameter bc as zetterberg et al 2013 2016 had only analyzed effects on individual base cations 2 2 5 base cation tracing to investigate patterns potentially hidden by spatial variability additional model runs were also set up using the average values from all four ch plots at each site the arithmetic means were then used to define layer thickness soil texture organic matter content cec bs soil density and mineralogy then both the ch and wth scenarios were run separately these runs were used to trace the fate of base cations contained in harvest residues left on sites in forsafe base cations can be contained in five different pools deadwood bcdead som including soil microbial biomass bcsom biomass bcbio exchangeable bc bcex and soil water bcsw since the amount of base cations momentarily contained in soil water is small in relation to other pools bcsw was neglected in all calculations however at each time step an amount of bc leaves the system through leaching in these calculations the cumulative leaching bcleach is accounted for as a fifth term when tracing the fate of the base cations at each annual time step the difference in size of each bc pool between ch and wth plots was calculated as 1 δ b c p b c p c h b c p w t h where bcp is the total amount of base cations in pool p and δbcp is the difference in pool size between ch and wth harvesting the proportion of the whole base cation difference between ch and wth attributable to pool p φbcp is then calculated as 2 φ b c p δ b c p δ b c h 100 where δbch is the total difference in bc between ch and wth harvesting immediately after clear cut 3 results 3 1 effects from whole tree harvesting 3 1 1 tree biomass at all four sites observed biomass was on average higher on ch plots than on wth plots fig 1 the effect was smallest at lund with on average 6 higher biomass on ch plots and largest at kosta with on average 36 higher biomass on ch plots just before the first thinning 25 years after clear cut the difference between ch and wth plots was significant at tönnersjöheden and kosta p 0 05 but not significant at lund and lövliden in the latter case because of large between plot variability biomass growth was reasonably well modelled in forsafe although there was a tendency of a too fast initial growth rate at kosta and lövliden fig 1 the negative effects of slower tree growth on wth plots were also captured by the model modelled biomass was significantly higher on ch than on wth plots at tönnersjöheden kosta and lövliden but not at lund table 1 3 1 2 base cations in soil water in the statistical analysis on observed data treatment i e harvesting intensity had a significant effect on bc soil water concentrations for samples taken 2003 2005 but not for the samples taken 2008 2010 although the effect from the interaction term site x treatment was weakly significant the statistical analysis on modelled data showed no significant effect from treatment for any of those two distinct time periods however when analyzing the earlier time period of 1981 1983 approx 5 7 years after clear cut the treatment effect was significant p 0 017 fig 2 table 2 the implication of these results is that soil water bc concentrations were likely higher on ch plots than on wth plots for the first decades after clear cut and thus leaching was an important sink for base cations on ch plots relative to wth plots during this time period at some point in time this effect gradually subsided and 35 years after clear cut only small differences remained observations suggest that this shift happened 30 years after clear cut while it occurred about 10 years earlier in the model simulations 3 1 3 exchangeable base cations regarding the store of bcex organic layer upper 20 cm of the mineral soil previous studies have demonstrated that a bcex tended to decrease during the period 15 to 37 years after clear cut and b bcex was significantly higher at ch plots than at wth plots 15 years after clear cut but two decades later the differences were no longer significant brandtberg and olsson 2012 zetterberg et al 2013 the lund site however deviated from this pattern with increasing bcex and an increasing difference in bcex between ch and wth plots was observed fig 3 the model in general predicted small effects from wth on bcex at least in comparison with the plot to plot variability the only site that displayed a clear but temporary effect on bcex was tönnersjöheden furthermore with the exception of lund modelled bcex tended to be higher than previously observed especially for lövliden where there was almost no overlap between the intervals covered by modelled and previously observed bcex fig 4 the observed decreasing difference in bcex between ch and wth plots was not captured in the modelled results which is reflected in the non significant effect from the interaction term site x treatment table 3 one possible reason for the discrepancies between modelled and observed bcex is the large spatial variability between plots in the samples to which forsafe was calibrated for all sites except tönnersjöheden the intra site variability in 2016 the year to which the modelled bcex was calibrated was much larger than on previous sampling occasions fig 3 differences between modelled and previously measured bcex can therefore possibly be attributed to differences in sampling procedures 3 1 4 summary tree growth curves were reasonably well modelled in forsafe as well as the negative effects from wth forsafe simulations agreed with the observations that there was an initial effect from harvesting intensity on soil water bc concentrations and by implication leaching but that this effect subsided with time however the timing of this shift differed between observations and simulations as observations indicated that differences remained up to 30 years after clear cut while the modelled effect from harvesting intensity lasted for 20 years for exchangeable bc forsafe was not able to reproduce the observed the different dynamics between ch and wth plots one reason for this is that the between plot variability of the 2016 samples to which forsafe was calibrated exceeds the effect from wth on bcex pools this may in turn may be an artifact from the sampling procedure 3 2 tracing base cations 3 2 1 distribution of base cations between pools in forsafe harvest residues left on site after conventional harvesting contain base cations which with time will be redistributed to tree biomass stored in the soil as exchangeable base cations or in the soil organic matter or leave the ecosystem through leaching in forsafe woody residue i e branches and stumps is represented as deadwood while needles and fine roots are directly distributed to the four litter quality classes of the som the modelled difference in total bc left on site after clear cut between ch and wth plots δbch was 1 31 eq m2 for tönnersjöheden 1 12 eq m2 for kosta 1 38 eq m2 for lövliden and 0 6 eq m2 for lund corresponding estimates of the actual difference between ch and wth plots were 1 12 1 15 1 44 and 0 30 eq m2 respectively björkroth and rosén 1977 zetterberg et al 2013 fig 4 table 4 demonstrate how these extra base cations are distributed between bcdead bcsom bcbio bcex and bcleach the only term possible to evaluate against observations is δbcbio which can be estimated from observed biomass stem bark branches needles and roots and bc concentrations in samples from tree tissues the modelled re distribution of bc to biomass agreed exceptionally well with observed data except for tönnersjöheden where modelled δbcbio was significantly higher than observed table 4 furthermore the model could now clearly reproduce the subsiding effect from wth on bcex at tönnersjöheden and lövliden as well as the opposing pattern at lund 3 2 2 summary loss of bc through leaching was approximately equally important at all four sites with δbcleach equaling 35 45 after 45 years most of the extra leaching from ch plots occurred during the first decade after clear cut and for the two northern sites there was no increase at all in δbcleach after 20 years following clear cut a substantial share of base cations is contained in som δbcsom was approximately constant at 20 30 for the first 45 years after clear cut at all four sites the rapid decrease in δbcex observed at tönnersjöheden lövliden and kosta zetterberg et al 2013 was captured by forsafe for the two former sites but not for kosta for lund δbcex increased with time 20 45 years after clear cut which is in accordance with observations fig 4 with the exception of lund δbcbio grew steadily throughout the first 45 years after clear cut note that for the first thinning at kosta in 2000 the original treatment was repeated with a larger harvest of biomass from wth plots since harvested biomass is included in the biomass term this temporarily decreased bc in biomass on ch plots relative to wth plots 4 discussion 4 1 forsafe background and assumptions forsafe is a forest ecosystem model including biological geochemical and hydrological processes it is a unique model in that it aims to simultaneously simulate the biogeochemical cycles of several elements and their interdependencies rather than exclusively focusing on ecosystem components regardless of ecosystem the elemental biogeochemical cycles and their interactions are assumed to be governed by the same processes in response to the microclimatic and chemical environmental containing their different stages such as soil solution chemistry for the aqueous soil phase this requires high resolution in process descriptions but it allows the model to address feedback mechanisms and non linear responses and reduces the need for parameter calibration subsequently forsafe is better suited and intended to reproduce broader behavioral patterns in response to anthropogenic changes such as forest cutting or changes in climate and less suited to exactly replicating reality where the model fails to reproduce observed patterns it is able to highlight the processes that are not well described by the model the long term whole tree harvest experiments initiated in the 1970 s have been the subject of numerous studies in this study our aim was to investigate if the key results in these studies could be reproduced by the forest ecosystem model forsafe a tree growth is significantly faster after ch than after wth egnell and leijon 1999 egnell and valinger 2003 egnell 2011 b wth effects on soil water bc concentrations were ambiguous or non significant 28 34 years after clear cut zetterberg et al 2013 c wth had significant negative effects on the store of exchangeable bc 15 years after clear cut however this effect had diminished or disappeared after another ten years brandtberg and olsson 2012 zetterberg et al 2013 when ran on individual plots the results from forsafe agreed well with a fig 1 and fairly well with b fig 2 however the model did not reproduce differences in the dynamics of bcex between ch and wth plots fig 3 when forsafe instead was used to simulate ch and wth with identical input data so that the modelled response to harvest intensity is not obscured by plot to plot variability the results were in agreement with c as well fig 4 while it has been hypothesized that the two effects are related i e that the initially larger bcex stores on ch plots becomes depleted by faster tree growth and higher uptake brandtberg and olsson 2012 it is still not fully understood how base cations contained in harvest residues are distributed between trees soil and water over time this is partly because leaching mainly occurred during the first decade after clear cut before any soil water samples were collected zetterberg et al 2016 quantified the fluxes of base cations following ch and wth respectively for the long term experiments studied here using the geochemical acidification model magic however the model exaggerated the soil ca2 losses during the development of the new tree stand and did not reproduce the rapid diminishing differences between ch and wth the authors attributed this to the lack of biological feedback mechanisms in magic or alternatively imperfect description of processes such as the non dynamic pool of organic matter 4 2 uncertainties and limitations acknowledging the complexity of the biochemical cycles in a forest ecosystem the descriptions of most processes in forsafe are of course simplified furthermore uncertainties in the sampling processes affect the results some of the important error sources in this study were since forsafe assumes active base cation uptake modelled tissue concentrations of base cations were the same on ch and wth plots in reality unless it is a limiting nutrient base cation uptake is likely to be passive knecht göransson 2004 which should give higher needle concentrations of bc on ch plots where more base cations are available a higher bc concentration in needle tissue on ch plots was indeed confirmed at tönnersjöheden but none of the other sites olsson unpublished data this was also the reason why the parameters fraction of luxury uptake and average concentration in wood had to be calibrated to observations as running the model with the initial set of parameters resulted in much too high needle base cation concentrations the modelled tree growth was slightly too fast fig 1 and especially the canopy growth the modelled canopy had reached full size after 15 years on southern sites and 23 years on northern sites in contrast observations indicated that the canopy was still growing after 45 years of development of the new stand furthermore the amaxfrac parameter was decreased for the two northern sites to account for the very slow initial growth the slower tree growth in the north may be due to both low nitrogen availability tamm 2012 and negative effects from sub zero ambient air temperatures in late spring and early autumn on photosynthesis bergh et al 1998 soil samples were collected from one soil pit per plot in contrast to earlier studies where a total of 25 samples per plot were collected olsson et al 1996 however previous soil sampling only included the upper 20 cm whereas forsafe requires soil samples representing the entire rooting zone this sampling procedure is more intrusive and it was not practically possible to better represent the spatial variability within each plot this is likely the cause for the much larger among plot variability in modelled bcex compared to previous observations fig 3 4 3 modelled biogeochemical process 4 3 1 tree growth tree growth the average modelled effects from wth on tree growth was correctly simulated in forsafe in broader terms although the variability among sites was smaller compared to observations table 1 in the forsafe simulations trees on ch plots grew faster because they had access to more nitrogen increasing the n fraction of foliage which increases the photosynthesis rates aber et al 1996 a higher n content in needles on ch plots than on wth plots was confirmed for tissue samples taken 8 10 years after clear cut however 16 18 years after clear cut no significant differences in n content remained olsson et al 2000 egnell 2011 in general forsafe predicted 1 a larger effect on tree growth from wth on pine stands than on spruce stands comparing tönnersjöheden and kosta this reflected the higher nitrogen use efficiency of pine niinemets 2002 2 a larger effect of wth on tree growth in relative terms on northern than on southern sites comparing tönnersjöheden and lövliden this is because the nitrogen dose added as harvest residues is much larger relative to deposition at the northern sites whereas n contained in harvest residues at tönnersjöheden corresponded to 14 years of n deposition it corresponded to more than 60 years of deposition and fixation at lövliden the lund site however was an obvious exception to these rules as it despite being a northern pine stand displayed the smallest effect from wth in forsafe the reason for this was that trees at lund were strictly nitrogen limited on both ch and wth plots i e the n concentrations in needles were at the lower critical level for pine of 12 mg n g dw the modelled results agreed with observations and egnell and leijon 1999 hypothesized that the small effect on tree growth at lund was due to the ability of nutrient poor pine stands to compensate for nitrogen deficits by increased fixation a mechanism that forsafe was not able to capture 4 3 2 ion exchange brandtberg and olsson 2012 and zetterberg et al 2013 both reported that differences in bcex between ch and wth plots decreased with time at tönnersjöheden lövliden and kosta this trend was reproduced by forsafe for two of the sites tönnersjöheden and lövliden for kosta the modelled δbcex remained nearly constant until 45 years after clear cut and demands from higher growth rates on ch plots were instead supported by release of bc from decomposing deadwood and som the reasons for this were mainly a the addition of c a 0 2 eq ha additional base cations on ch plots after the thinning in 2000 as the harvesting treatment was repeated and b the c a 50 higher cec at kosta than at tönnersjöheden and lövliden the latter may be an artifact from the sampling procedure previous studies did report higher cec in the organic layer for kosta but the total cec down to 20 cm was not higher at kosta than at the other sites zetterberg et al 2013 in forsafe decreasing δbcex was mainly driven by faster tree growth and higher bc uptake on ch plots the hypothesis that tree growth drives these changes is supported by both observations fig 3 and forsafe simulations fig 4 from the fourth site lund there patterns were reversed with an increasing δbcex and a decreasing δbcbio with time 4 3 3 leaching of the bc added as harvest residues on ch plots between 35 kosta and 45 lövliden and lund had been lost through leaching after 45 years fig 4 most of the leaching losses occurred during the first decade after clear cut associated with leaching of no3 in the forsafe simulations half of the total extra leaching of base cations from ch plots up until 45 years after clear cut occurred during the first 6 7 years at the northern sites and during the first 11 years at the two southern sites 4 4 implications effects from whole tree harvesting the cost of whole tree harvesting can be divided into short term and long term impacts on trees soil and runoff water chemistry short term impacts can be defined as effects limited to one rotation period and include a loss in tree growth and lowered buffering capacity of runoff due to reduced leaching of base cations long term impacts can be defined as persistent effects on soil status and include permanent reductions in the bc stocks in the soil consisting of exchangeable base cations and base cations contained in recalcitrant organic matter in the forsafe simulations the most common fate for the base cations left in harvest residues after 40 years of development of the new stand was loss by leaching consistently throughout the four study sites however this is not necessarily to say that negative effects on the quality of runoff water should always be the major concern when evaluating effects of harvest practices losses of bc to runoff may be tolerable as long as the buffering capacity is sufficient to withstand acid episodes a deep saturated zone below the rooting zone will generally provide for a sufficient buffering capacity for the draining stream network erlandsson et al 2016 negative effects on tree growth from wth have been previously documented on these sites egnell and leijon 1999 egnell and valinger 2003 egnell 2011 and were also largely correctly captured in forsafe fig 1 long term depletion of soil bc stocks may be more serious as it weakens the soil s potential to sustain the biochemical base cation cycle much attention has been focused on the store of exchangeable base cations on which long term effects from wth appears limited as suggested both by observations and models instead the results from this study suggest that the effects from wth on som pools of base cations are both larger and more persistent than those on the exchangeable store acknowledgments the authors wish to express their gratitude for the financial support granted by the swedish energy agency as well as the project biodiversity and ecosystem services in a

timrilt 2014 2015 per erik karlsson pers comm to account for the effect of tree size on dd the calculated dd was multiplied with a factor that equaled zero directly after clear cut and increased linearly to reach a value of one 30 years after clear cut the calculated ddf was then applied to the whole time series to calculated dd from wd the modelled deposition of so4 2 no3 and nh4 pre 1996

the observed values from sampling in 2016 to establish the initial conditions the model was run under constant climate and deposition scenarios for a given period of time the length of the initialization period was estimated from knowledge of the land use history where shorter period was chosen for the southern sites and especially for tönnersjöheden which was not forested prior to the 1900 s for the northern sites which were pristine forests before clear cutting in the 1970 s longer initialization periods were used and especially for lövliden where a longer initialization period was required to build up the n store in the soil to match the observed table a1 table a4 
24959,the decline of the natural ecosystem on the ogasawara islands caused by invasive species has been an important environmental problem and projects for eradicating invasive species are currently underway some invasive species have proliferated in the host environment and are affecting the material cycle in the ecosystem if the invasive species were removed from the environment the material cycle of the ecosystem may be altered and native species that should be protected may be negatively affected after the introduction of invasive alien species namely goats and rats the vegetation declined on nakoudojima island an island that belongs to the ogasawara islands therefore in this study a mathematical model was developed to simulate and analyze the ecosystem changes that occurred following the eradication of goats and rats when only rats were eradicated the island s vegetation changed to grassland but revegetation was delayed and the biomass of the native animal species did not recover significantly when only goats were eradicated the vegetation recovered and the biomass of the native animal species increased however the island became forested and many native herbaceous plant species became extinct when goats and rats were eradicated simultaneously the vegetation recovered and the biomass of the native animal species increased however the ecosystem became very unstable and two extreme results were obtained the vegetation of the entire island changed to either forest or grassland the results of this study suggest that instead of simply eradicating invasive species it is necessary to monitor post eradication changes in the ecosystem and take adaptive measures as required keywords insular ecosystem invasive species eradication ecosystem change scenario evaluation computer simulation 1 introduction in many parts of the world invasive species are causing environmental problems it has long been suggested that island ecosystems especially ecosystems on oceanic islands are susceptible to damages caused by invasive species elton 1958 the ogasawara islands registered in 2011 as a world natural heritage site is no exception following the start of human settlement in the 19th century the unique ecosystems of the islands were severely damaged by the introduction of multiple alien species therefore projects are currently underway on many of the islands in an attempt to eradicate such species however invasive species cannot simply be removed from the environment because many have already established an interactive system with local native species in the host ecosystem removing invasive species can have a negative impact on the native species with which the invasive species interact human intervention can affect many native species if indirect effects are included especially if the interactions between native and invasive species are complex therefore removing component species from an ecosystem even if they are invasive species may disrupt the ecosystem pimm 1980 zavaleta et al 2001 quince et al 2005 in addition some invasive species may flourish in the host ecosystems and represent a large portion of the ecosystem s biomass goats rats beefwoods white popinacs and bishop woods are examples of this on the ogasawara islands removal of these species would greatly alter the material circulation of the ecosystem and concerns exist about the impact on native species it is desirable that the potential impacts of a project on the native ecosystem via material circulation are identified prior to starting an eradication project or during the early stages of an eradication project one effective method is the use of computer simulations this allows for the estimation of the effects of human intervention and the proposal of specific eradication methods that exert the least influence on the native ecosystem some theoretical studies on the effects of species removal have been conducted pimm 1980 quince et al 2005 these studies aimed to reveal the general trends of the effect on biological communities in cases where the target area for the computer simulation is specified it is necessary to conduct the simulation using a mathematical model capable of representing the ecosystem of the area recently several studies have been published raymond et al 2011 sahasrabudhe and motter 2011 bode et al 2015 baker et al 2017 that reveal interesting behavior of biological communities and can contribute to managing the target ecosystems such studies should continue to advance a potential method is to incorporate actual material cycle processes into the model ecosystem previous studies considered only predator prey interactions by using simple forms of equations however real ecosystems are more complicated material cycles in real ecosystems involve several types of interactions e g competition one handed interference and processes in real ecosystems the growth of producers cannot be expressed by r alone even if plants receive adequate sunlight they cannot grow without nutrients complicated models are not always good ludwig and walters 1985 iwasa 1990 however overly simplified models cannot analyze the complex phenomena in real ecosystems therefore we developed an ecosystem model incorporating material cycle processes yoshida et al submitted this model provides a good reproduction of the current state of ecosystem on the nakoudojima island the target island of this study in the ogasawara island group the location for this study was the nakoudojima island in the ogasawara islands the nakoudojima island belongs to the mukojima islands located 50 km north of chichijima island in the ogasawara islands on nakoudojima island two invasive species feral goats and rats were an issue in the 1990s ogasawara islands ecosystem conservation action plan kanto regional environment office of japan et al 2010 feral goats often destruct vegetation and accelerate soil erosion by grazing and trampling coblentz 1978 coblentz and van vuren 1987 this has occurred on nakoudojima island on this island grassland and denuded areas expanded while deforestation continued hata et al 2007 kachi 2010 in addition feral goats interfere with seabird nesting by trampling nests mcchesney and tershy 1998 chiba et al 2007 because black rats are known to be generalist omnivores they have substantial effects on plants and invertebrates hashimoto 2010 in particular impacts on endemic land snails chiba 2007 endemic insects karube 2010 and small seabirds have been severe jones et al 2008 kawakami et al 2010 however a project for the eradication of invasive goats on the island ended in 1999 hata et al 2007 in addition the eradication of rats is now being planned ogasawara islands ecosystem conservation action plan kanto regional environment office of japan et al 2010 approximately 20 years have passed since the completion of the goat eradication project and it is important to identify changes in the ecosystem resulting from their removal consequently a simulation model reproducing the ecosystem of nakoudojima island was warranted we developed such a model which could reproduce ecosystem conditions on nakoudojima island as disturbed by invasive species yoshida et al submitted using this model we may be able to make strong predictions regarding changes in the ecosystem of nakoudojima island after eradication of invasive species in this study simulations of the eradication of invasive goats and rats were conducted the goals were to identify changes in the post eradication ecosystem and propose a desirable eradication scenario 2 methods 2 1 outline of the model the ecosystem of nakoudojima island prior to the eradication of invasive goats fig 1 was represented using an ecosystem model developed in a previous study and the model s details and parameters are described in appendix method and yoshida et al submitted the nutrient cycle on oceanic islands is characteristically a closed system in a small area that receives an input of necessary nutrient from seabirds hiradate et al 2015 an island ecosystem consists of seabirds plants native and invasive trees and grasses and invertebrate animals primarily arthropods we assume feeding types are herbivorous carnivorous scavenger litter eating and coprophagous only where goat droppings are present an ecosystem includes numerous species and often not much is known about their ecology in the model ecological traits of some of such species are determined by several methods appendix method yoshida et al submitted in general seabirds feed on fish at sea and leave droppings and die on islands the droppings and carcasses decompose over time or are eaten by scavengers and are broken down into nutrient available to plants and stored in below ground sinks plants grow by absorbing only the necessary amount of nutrient plants are classified into herbaceous and woody plants and plants that occupy a similar niche compete against each other the model assumes that herbaceous plants grow faster than woody plants but grow to shorter heights and so cannot compete with woody plants plants are used by herbivorous animals the model assumes only herbivorous invertebrates invasive goats and rats herbivores are preyed on by carnivorous invertebrates and invasive rats our model incorporates the following four processes the growth of animals and plants predator prey relationship detritus decomposition and competition in several forms competition among plant species and seabird species disturbance of seabird nests by goats and trampling of plants by goats and seabirds for the details of the model see appendix method and our previous paper yoshida et al submitted variables are explained in full detail below parameter values supported by the literature were used where possible and where relevant literature was not available e g traits of species that have not been studied in detail values considered reasonable by an expert were estimated and iterative simulations were used to determine values that reproduce the actual island ecosystems appendix method yoshida et al submitted 2 2 simulation of eradication of invasive species the eradication began 10 000 days after the start of the simulation in this study three various scenarios were used only goats are eradicated only rats are eradicated both goats and rats are eradicated in simulating the eradication of goats a constant amount of goat biomass was removed daily from the virtual ecosystem in this research we ran a simulation assuming that 40 kg of biomass was removed on a daily basis at this removal rate the eradication was completed in approximately 100 days the actual goat eradication on the island was performed intermittently and completion required approximately one year the eradication pressure used in this simulation was believed to be stronger than the actual eradication pressure used for the goat population the adopted removal rate was chosen because a lower rate may have resulted in failure to eradicate the goats the simulation assumed that the eradicated goats remained in the ecosystem as carcasses as it occurred in the actual eradication project rats have been eradicated on many islands however they are difficult to eradicate and such attempts often fail harper and bunburyb 2015 holmes et al 2015 keitt et al 2015 russell and holmes 2015 amos et al 2016 in the ogasawara islands a previous attempt to eradicate rats on nishijima island failed reasons for the difficulty to eradicate rats include their high fertility the difficulty in capturing them due to their agility and their small size which allows them to use hiding spaces such as gaps between rocks and reduces the catch efficiency at low population densities the process of catching rats under these conditions can be described as a holling iii functional response ito et al 1992 therefore in this study the simulation assumed that workers engaging in the eradication project would remove rat biomass in accordance with the following equation holling iii type yamamura et al 1978 d e d t k m m 2 c m 2 where de dt biomass removed per unit hour k interaction coefficient between eradication workers and rats m biomass of eradication workers m biomass of rats c constant reflects handling time in this study k 0 3 m 3 assuming the involvement of 50 workers and c 0 5 were used the removed biomass remained in the ecosystem as carcasses the efforts for eradicating rats continued until the end of the simulation as a result rats were not eradicated but the biomass of rats was reduced to 1 10 compared with the original status table 1 see the total biomass of rat after eradication of rat for each scenario a 10 000 day observation period was set and the final status was compared among the scenarios the simulation was run 1000 times for each scenario 3 results 3 1 changes in the ecosystem between pre and post eradication fig 2 shows the changes in vegetation ratio between pre and post eradication before the eradication grassland was the dominant vegetation and approximately 24 of the island was without vegetation fig 2 the value was compatible to the real data measured by hata et al 2007 yoshida et al submitted when only goats were eradicated the vegetation improved dramatically and bare ground disappeared transforming almost the entire island into a forested area fig 2 when only rats were eradicated grassland was the dominant vegetation however the vegetation did not improve as much as it did for the eradication of goats leaving 7 of the island without vegetation fig 2 when both goats and rats were eradicated bare ground disappeared almost entirely and grassland and forested areas accounted for 50 each of the island s area on average fig 2 however compared with other scenarios where goats and rats were eradicated separately the standard deviation was considerably higher table 1 fig 2 the changes in the entire ecosystem are summarized in table 1 and fig 3 when goats were eradicated the amount of nutrient salt in the soil and the amount of litter increased noticeably table 1 fig 3a on the other hand both the number and biomass of invertebrate species decreased specifically the number of herbivorous invertebrate species decreased by approximately 24 table 1 fig 3a for carnivorous invertebrates the number of species decreased by 31 and the biomass decreased by 56 table 1 fig 3a the number of forest nesting seabird species increased but a decrease was observed for grassland nesting seabird species resulting in an overall decrease in the number of seabird species table 1 fig 3a however the biomass increased significantly for both grassland nesting and forest nesting seabirds with the latter exhibiting a more pronounced increase table 1 fig 3a while 11 of woody plants became extinct the number of herbaceous plant species decreased significantly to 18 compared to pre eradication table 1 fig 3a while the biomass of woody plants increased significantly the biomass of herbaceous plants decreased to a near extinction level table 1 fig 3a after the eradication of goats the biomass of rats increased more than five fold table 1 fig 3a white popinacs increased significantly with a 10 fold increase in biomass and a 14 fold increase in area table 1 fig 3a when rats were eradicated the biomass of carnivorous invertebrates increased significantly table 1 fig 3b in addition the amount of nutrient salt the biomass of herbaceous plants and the biomass of herbivorous invertebrates increased slightly table 1 fig 3b however many parameters exhibited little recovery or worsened compared with pre eradication table 1 fig 3b these results indicated that it was not desirable to eradicate only rats when goats and rats were eradicated simultaneously many parameters showed a marked increase table 1 fig 3c in addition the rate of increase in white popinacs was reduced compared to a scenario where only goats were eradicated table 1 fig 3c these results indicated that recovery effects were highest when goats and rats were eradicated simultaneously however the number of herbivorous invertebrates decreased by approximately 20 and the number of herbaceous plants decreased by approximately 42 table 1 fig 3c 3 2 vegetation changes for the simultaneous eradication of goats and rats detailed analysis was performed concerning the resulting vegetation following the simultaneous eradication of goats and rats grasslands and forests accounted for an average of 50 each of the total area fig 2 however results did not correspond to the average fig 4 out of 1000 simulations nearly the entire island changed to grassland 421 times but for 468 times the ratio of grassland lower than 10 fig 4 out of these 468 simulations nearly the entire island became forested 459 times and became denuded called crashed ecosystem see below section 3 4 these results showed that following the simultaneous eradication of goats and rats the ecosystem became bi stable resulting in the entire island to become either forest or grassland dominated to examine whether it was possible to predict whether forests or grasslands became dominant after the simultaneous eradication of goats and rats the pre eradication characteristics of the forest and grassland ecosystems were compared strongly significant statistical differences 99 9 were observed only for the number of species and the biomass of carnivorous invertebrates table 2 slightly significant statistical differences 95 were observed for the total amount of litter that of biomass of tree rat and white popinac table 2 a comparison of the biomass of herbivorous invertebrates in the forest and grassland ecosystems after the simultaneous eradication of goats and rats indicated that the biomass of herbivorous invertebrates was twice as high in the grasslands compared to the forests mean biomass of herbivorous invertebrates in the grassland was 22 28 s d 16 67 and in the forest was 11 06 s d 9 20 3 3 results with large standard deviations as with the vegetation rate mentioned in section 3 2 the amounts of nutrients and litter and biomass of herbivorous invertebrates and seabirds also had large standard deviations after the eradication of goats and rats table 1 the total seabird biomass after eradication was widely distributed from 0 to 90 appendix fig 1a as a result it exhibited a large standard deviation table 1 in addition it had a strong peak in the interval from 40 to 45 appendix fig 1a appendix fig 1b represents the distribution of the biomass of grassland nesting seabirds this distribution had two peaks the interval from 40 to 45 and that from 0 to 5 appendix fig 1b when the entire area of the island was covered by grassland in the model the biomass of grassland nesting seabirds reached a maximum carrying capacity approximately 45 and that of forest nesting seabirds was 0 conversely when the island was covered by forest the biomass of grassland nesting seabirds was 0 and that of forest nesting birds reached the maximum value because the ecosystem became bi stable fig 4 the total biomass of seabirds was approximately 45 in most cases appendix fig 1a in 111 cases of 1000 simulations forest and grassland coexisted neither coverage ratio exceeded 90 in such cases the total biomass of seabirds was greater than 45 because the two types of seabirds coexisted the maximum biomass of seabirds was 85 6 in rare cases vegetation on the island was not restored and a wide denuded area remained in 9 cases of 1000 simulations the ratio of vegetation area did not exceed 80 as mentioned below in such cases the seabird biomass declined the minimum was 3 97 therefore seabird biomass was widely distributed from near 0 to 90 the distribution of the amount of nutrients after eradication of goats and rats had two peaks with intervals from 0 to 100 and from 500 to 700 appendix fig 2 then we compared the two types of ecosystems for which the amount of nutrients after eradication was less than 100 or was larger than 500 ecosystems having a low amount of nutrients had a larger ratio of forest appendix table 1 such ecosystems had smaller numbers of grass species and grassland nesting seabird species appendix table 1 indicating forest expansion such ecosystems also had greater species diversity and biomass of carnivorous invertebrates and a lower biomass of herbivorous invertebrates these features are compatible with those of forested ecosystems after eradication table 2 these results indicate that nutrients in forested ecosystems were stored in aboveground parts of the forest and not in belowground reservoirs because forests had a much larger biomass aboveground than did grasslands in fact the amount of nutrients in forested ecosystems was negatively related to tree biomass appendix fig 3 as mentioned above after eradication of goats and rats vegetation and seabird biomass in ecosystems were restored fig 3 and table 1 consequently the nutrient supply was increased in the case of grassland ecosystems nutrient supply was stored in belowground reservoirs then the value of the amounts of nutrients increased conversely in the case of forest ecosystems nutrients were converted from the belowground reservoirs to tree biomass then the value of the amounts of nutrients decreased the distribution litter after eradication exhibited two peaks at intervals from 0 to 400 and from 1000 to 1500 appendix fig 4 we compared two types of ecosystems for which the amount of litter after eradication was less than 400 or was greater than 1000 appendix table 2 the most remarkable difference between them was in the vegetation ecosystems having a small amount of litter were covered by grasslands on the other hand those having a large amount of litter were covered by forests other differences in characteristics between ecosystems with small or large amounts of litter were similar to the aforementioned case for amounts of nutrients appendix table 1 it appeared that forests produce greater amounts of litter than grasslands because forests have a large amount of biomass per unit area then we analyzed the relationship between the amount of plant biomass and that of litter appendix fig 5 the amount of litter was positively related to that of plant biomass in addition it was obvious that forested ecosystems had greater amounts of plant biomass and litter and grassland ecosystems have smaller amounts this result clearly indicated that the amount of litter was strongly controlled by vegetation type the amount of biomass of herbivorous invertebrates also exhibited a large standard deviation table 1 the distribution of biomass of herbivorous invertebrates exhibited a peak in the interval from 5 to 10 and was skewed to the right then we compared the two types of ecosystems for which the biomass of herbivorous invertebrates was in the interval from 5 to 10 or was greater than 30 appendix table 3 ecosystems having a smaller biomass of herbivorous invertebrates had a lower diversity of grass species greater diversity and biomass of carnivorous invertebrates and a smaller ratio of grasslands their features were similar to those of ecosystems that had small amounts of nutrients appendix table 1 and a large amount of litter appendix table 2 that is ecosystems covered by forest after eradication of goats and rats table 2 in fact of 337 ecosystems for which the biomass of herbivorous invertebrates was in the interval from 5 to 10 225 ecosystems were almost completely covered by forest the ratio of forest was greater than 90 and 169 ecosystems were completely covered by forest the ratio of forest was 100 3 4 crashed ecosystems of 1000 simulated ecosystems vegetation of 9 ecosystems was not restored after the eradication of goats and rats these are called crashed ecosystems it is very important to predict such undesirable results before eradication thus we analyzed the properties prior to eradication for these crashed ecosystems as compared with other ecosystems crashed ecosystems had small amounts of nutrients low diversity of grass species a small ratio of grassland areas low diversity and biomass of animal species a large ratio of denuded areas and a high ratio and biomass of white popinac forest table 3 these results indicated that crashed ecosystems before eradication were destroyed by invasive species to a greater extent than were other ecosystems we investigated changes in 9 crashed ecosystems after eradication of goats and rats after eradication the forest area fluctuated rapidly and strongly fig 5 a such fluctuation was never observed in ecosystems that did not crash the first pulse of forest primarily consisted of white popinac fig 5b forest area 30 93 area of white popinac 27 80 the fluctuation pattern of biomass of herbivorous invertebrates was similar but slightly delayed relative to that of forest areas fig 5a c this result indicated that the fluctuation pattern of forest areas was mainly controlled by herbivorous invertebrates when the ecosystem was completely covered by forest approximately the 14 500th time step fig 5b grass species went extinct after that the forest rapidly declined once more but the rapid and strong fluctuation in forest area ceased and forest area increased very slightly fig 5a then large denuded areas remained 4 discussion 4 1 implications for the behavior of the model system it is well known that invasive mammals severely disturb species in invaded ecosystems e g elton 1958 williamson 1996 courchamp et al 2003 kachi 2010 then after eradication of invasive mammals the biomass and observable number of species were increased as compared with the pre eradication state plants hamann 1975 1979 hata et al 2007 2010 2014 seabirds robertson et al 1994 kawakami et al 2010 invertebrates lorvelec and pascal 2005 the same tendencies were observed in the simulations in this study table 1 fig 3 from these results it is considered that the model in this study could reproduce substantial properties of natural ecosystems fig 6 shows a simplified schematic diagram of the interactions in the ecosystem represented in the model if only goats are eradicated their feeding pressure decreases thereby improving the vegetation fig 6b in addition the disturbance of nesting sites caused by goats decreases facilitating the reproduction of seabirds table 1 fig 3 as a result the supply of nutrient salts increases significantly due to the increase in seabirds feces and carcasses table 1 fig 3 thereby accelerating revegetation if goats are eradicated the biomass of rats that compete with goats for food increases table 1 figs 3 and 6b if rats increase their feeding pressure on invertebrates increases fig 6b thereby reducing the number and biomass of invertebrate species table 1 fig 3 if herbivorous invertebrates decrease their feeding pressure on plants decreases fig 6b further promoting revegetation some organisms are affected negatively by an increase in rats while rats prey on seabirds they eat only small birds kawakami et al 2010 in other words the biomass of seabirds as a whole is not greatly affected therefore if goats are eradicated the supply of nutrient salts increases significantly table 1 fig 3 and becomes the driving force behind revegetation rats being omnivorous feed on plants and the rats feeding pressure on plants naturally increases however because rats also prey on other animals their feeding pressure on plants does not increase significantly because herbivorous invertebrates also decrease it is believed that the feeding pressure on plants would decrease compared to when goats are present why does the entire island become forested when goats are eradicated this is due to the decrease in the feeding pressure on plants fig 6b creating conditions where both herbaceous and woody plants can increase as a result herbaceous and woody plants compete with each other and the taller woody plants outcompete the herbaceous plants as a result the entire island becomes dominated by forest compared with the case where only goats are eradicated the ecosystem does not improve if only rats are eradicated table 1 fig 3 the most important reason for this outcome is that the number of goats remains the same goats feed on a wide range of plants and disturb seabird nesting sites fig 1 therefore the vegetation is damaged and the number of seabirds the driving force behind the improvement in the ecosystem does not increase if rats are removed invertebrates increase table 1 fig 3 and an increase in herbivorous invertebrates has a negative effect on revegetation as a result the vegetation does not improve entirely leaving bare patches of land table 1 figs 2 and 3 if both goats and rats are eradicated simultaneously on average most parameters will improve significantly table 1 fig 3 compared with the case where only goats are eradicated the rate of increase in white popinacs is reduced therefore it is desirable to eradication goats and rats simultaneously however there is a possibility that as forests improve the grassland area decreases which reduces the number of herbaceous plant species and grassland nesting seabird species these potential problems may call for the implementation of additional measures as pointed out by okochi 2009 the problem with the simultaneous eradication of goats and rats is that the post eradication ecosystem is likely to progress to one of two extreme outcomes either grassland or forested fig 4 this likely results from several parameters amounts of nutrients and litter biomass of herbivorous invertebrates and that of seabirds which had large standard deviations see results 3 3 and table 1 because the amount of litter and biomass of seabirds were directly influenced by vegetation and the amount of nutrients were directly affected by the biomass of seabirds regarding the biomass of herbivorous invertebrates see below the difficulty in predicting the final state of the ecosystem can pose a significant problem for managing the ecosystem therefore the resulting grassland and forest ecosystems were analyzed in terms of the pre eradication differences between the two the only strongly significant differences 99 9 found were the number and biomass of carnivorous invertebrate species table 2 if goats and rats are eradicated simultaneously plants and invertebrates do not experience the feeding pressure fig 6d the point is that following the eradication the herbivorous invertebrates directly control whether the island becomes forest or grassland and the woody plants outcompete the herbaceous plants due to their slow growth that makes them susceptible to feeding damage caused by the animals fig 6d prior to the eradication of goats and rats the invertebrates lived under rather harsh conditions on the island due to the high feeding pressure of rats and low plant biomass the herbivorous invertebrates cannot increase table 1 before eradication state this means that carnivorous invertebrates also cannot increase in biomass as a result when goats and rats are present the number of invertebrate species decreases rather significantly how the carnivorous invertebrates survive under these conditions determines the fate of the ecosystem fig 7 if goats and rats are eradicated the island s vegetation begins to improve herbivorous invertebrates start reproducing as the availability of prey improves and as they are free from the feeding pressures of rats if a sufficient number of carnivorous invertebrates remain the reproduction of herbivorous invertebrates is suppressed as a result woody plants and herbaceous plants propagate without being affected by herbivorous invertebrates and compete with each other fig 6d as a result woody plants outcompete the herbaceous plants and the island becomes forested figs 6d 7 if a sufficient number of carnivorous invertebrates are not present after the eradication of goats and rats the opposite process occurs fig 7 if only a small number of carnivorous invertebrates are present after the eradication of goats and rats the propagation of herbivorous invertebrates cannot be suppressed fig 5 6d 7 as a result while plants experience strong feeding pressure woody plants are more susceptible to feeding damage due to their lower proliferation potential therefore forests decline turning almost the entire island into grassland what does control the number of species and the amount of biomass of carnivorous invertebrate the total amount of biomass of rat may control them it is not a clear conclusion because the difference was small table 2 carnivorous invertebrates were prone to go extinct by the feeding pressure of rats because the biomass per single species of carnivorous invertebrate is much smaller than that of herbivorous invertebrate carnivore 0 114 herbivore 0 218 calculated from table 1 therefore the number of species of carnivorous invertebrate became smaller when the total biomass of rat was large the difference in the total amount of biomass of tree in table 2 was mainly depended on that of white popinac tree species other than white popinac could not increase by the strong feeding pressure of goats and rats however because white popinac has a large growth rate yoshida et al submitted it could slightly increase its biomass by the process shown in fig 7 the difference in the total amount of litter may be the result 4 2 crashed ecosystems although it was rare the model ecosystem could crash after eradication of goats and rats fig 5 for formulation of an ecological restoration plan it is very important to avoid such unfavorable results before eradication crashed ecosystems had a lower amount of nutrients low species diversities for invertebrates and plants a smaller area of grasslands and a larger area of white popinac table 3 in most cases ecosystems with a low species diversity for invertebrates became grasslands table 2 however in crashed ecosystems white popinac rapidly increases after eradication of goats and rats fig 5 white popinac is a pioneer tree species that has the ability to fix nitrogen jayasundara et al 1997 therefore white popinac can rapidly increase before the eradication state of crashed ecosystems leaving a large denuded area and a small amount of nutrients table 3 this rapid increase is considered a perturbation in crashed ecosystems that is strong enough to overcome the resilience of the ecosystems and then a so called regime shift e g scheffer et al 2001 occurred therefore in the crashed ecosystems there were rapid fluctuations with strong magnitudes in forest areas and in the biomass of herbivorous invertebrates fig 5a c when the forest area reached 100 grass species went extinct after that grassland never expanded even when forest declined then a large denuded area remained why did the fluctuations in forest area stop the fluctuations in forest area was strongly controlled by the amount of herbivorous invertebrates fig 5a c these were also affected by carnivorous invertebrates and grasses if forest area increases fig 8 a the biomass of herbivores increases fig 8b in this situation carnivorous invertebrates shift their feeding effort to herbivores of trees fig 8c the forest area decreases because of the high grazing pressure by herbivores of trees fig 8d the biomass of herbivores of trees is reduced by predation pressure by carnivores and the lack of food fig 8e if forest area decreases and the grassland area can expand fig 8d then the biomass of herbivores of grasses increases fig 8e therefore carnivorous invertebrates shift their feeding effort to herbivores of grasses fig 8f if the biomass of herbivores of trees is reduced forest can expand again fig 8a if forest area reaches 100 grasses go extinct e g approximately the 14 500th step in fig 5a at that time the cycle shown in fig 8 is stopped and the fluctuation of forest area does not occur again 4 3 today s nakoudojima island and further work on the real nakoudojima island only goats were eradicated in this case this study predicted that the island would be covered by forest table 1 figs 2 3 this was also observed on the galapagos islands sample plots test hamann 1975 1979 in fact the forest area on the island is expanding but the main component of the forest is white popinac osawa et al 2015 in addition the vegetation has not yet recovered although over 15 years have passed since the eradication of goats one of the reasons for the slow pace of vegetation recovery is soil erosion hata et al 2019 colonization of seedlings is directly interfered with by soil erosion in addition soil erosion exposes the subsoil which has a high value for soil exchange acidity and a smaller amount of nutrients under such conditions it is difficult for most plants to grow except for white popinac which has the ability to fix nitrogen jayasundara et al 1997 today s nakoudojima is in a condition similar to that of crashed ecosystems that is there is an increase in white popinac area and a small amount of nutrients table 3 fig 5b however strong fluctuations in forest area fig 5a have not been observed thus the ecosystem on nakoudojima island may not have crashed this study suggests that invasive goats and rats should be eradicated simultaneously table 1 figs 2 3 similar results were obtained in several previous studies caut et al 2007 griffiths 2011 innes and saunders 2011 glen et al 2013 thus this is considered to be a general conclusion however this is not always possible because of multiple reasons e g the budget limitation in this case it is very important to determine an adequate schedule for eradication because if an inadequate schedule is adopted native species may be in a critical situation okochi 2009 as the number of related species increases determining an eradication schedule becomes more difficult in such cases computer simulation is one of the most helpful methods and this study has already begun e g bode et al 2015 to make more practical plans for eradication of invasive species the issue of an eradication schedule should be considered in further studies 5 conclusion in this study three scenarios for eradicating invasive goats and rats were examined the results showed that while some level of ecosystem recovery could be expected from eradicating only goats it was desirable to eradication goats and rats simultaneously however in this scenario it may be necessary to give special care to herbaceous plants and grassland nesting seabirds in addition when goats and rats were eradicated simultaneously one of two extreme outcomes occurred the entire island became dominated by forest or grassland therefore it is suggested that instead of only setting the goal of eradicating the invasive species to conserve the island s ecosystem it is necessary to monitor post eradication changes in the ecosystem while taking adaptive measures as required acknowledgement this study was supported by grant in aid for scientific research a no 24710038 25241025 16h01794 from the japan society for the promotion of science we thank

24959,the decline of the natural ecosystem on the ogasawara islands caused by invasive species has been an important environmental problem and projects for eradicating invasive species are currently underway some invasive species have proliferated in the host environment and are affecting the material cycle in the ecosystem if the invasive species were removed from the environment the material cycle of the ecosystem may be altered and native species that should be protected may be negatively affected after the introduction of invasive alien species namely goats and rats the vegetation declined on nakoudojima island an island that belongs to the ogasawara islands therefore in this study a mathematical model was developed to simulate and analyze the ecosystem changes that occurred following the eradication of goats and rats when only rats were eradicated the island s vegetation changed to grassland but revegetation was delayed and the biomass of the native animal species did not recover significantly when only goats were eradicated the vegetation recovered and the biomass of the native animal species increased however the island became forested and many native herbaceous plant species became extinct when goats and rats were eradicated simultaneously the vegetation recovered and the biomass of the native animal species increased however the ecosystem became very unstable and two extreme results were obtained the vegetation of the entire island changed to either forest or grassland the results of this study suggest that instead of simply eradicating invasive species it is necessary to monitor post eradication changes in the ecosystem and take adaptive measures as required keywords insular ecosystem invasive species eradication ecosystem change scenario evaluation computer simulation 1 introduction in many parts of the world invasive species are causing environmental problems it has long been suggested that island ecosystems especially ecosystems on oceanic islands are susceptible to damages caused by invasive species elton 1958 the ogasawara islands registered in 2011 as a world natural heritage site is no exception following the start of human settlement in the 19th century the unique ecosystems of the islands were severely damaged by the introduction of multiple alien species therefore projects are currently underway on many of the islands in an attempt to eradicate such species however invasive species cannot simply be removed from the environment because many have already established an interactive system with local native species in the host ecosystem removing invasive species can have a negative impact on the native species with which the invasive species interact human intervention can affect many native species if indirect effects are included especially if the interactions between native and invasive species are complex therefore removing component species from an ecosystem even if they are invasive species may disrupt the ecosystem pimm 1980 zavaleta et al 2001 quince et al 2005 in addition some invasive species may flourish in the host ecosystems and represent a large portion of the ecosystem s biomass goats rats beefwoods white popinacs and bishop woods are examples of this on the ogasawara islands removal of these species would greatly alter the material circulation of the ecosystem and concerns exist about the impact on native species it is desirable that the potential impacts of a project on the native ecosystem via material circulation are identified prior to starting an eradication project or during the early stages of an eradication project one effective method is the use of computer simulations this allows for the estimation of the effects of human intervention and the proposal of specific eradication methods that exert the least influence on the native ecosystem some theoretical studies on the effects of species removal have been conducted pimm 1980 quince et al 2005 these studies aimed to reveal the general trends of the effect on biological communities in cases where the target area for the computer simulation is specified it is necessary to conduct the simulation using a mathematical model capable of representing the ecosystem of the area recently several studies have been published raymond et al 2011 sahasrabudhe and motter 2011 bode et al 2015 baker et al 2017 that reveal interesting behavior of biological communities and can contribute to managing the target ecosystems such studies should continue to advance a potential method is to incorporate actual material cycle processes into the model ecosystem previous studies considered only predator prey interactions by using simple forms of equations however real ecosystems are more complicated material cycles in real ecosystems involve several types of interactions e g competition one handed interference and processes in real ecosystems the growth of producers cannot be expressed by r alone even if plants receive adequate sunlight they cannot grow without nutrients complicated models are not always good ludwig and walters 1985 iwasa 1990 however overly simplified models cannot analyze the complex phenomena in real ecosystems therefore we developed an ecosystem model incorporating material cycle processes yoshida et al submitted this model provides a good reproduction of the current state of ecosystem on the nakoudojima island the target island of this study in the ogasawara island group the location for this study was the nakoudojima island in the ogasawara islands the nakoudojima island belongs to the mukojima islands located 50 km north of chichijima island in the ogasawara islands on nakoudojima island two invasive species feral goats and rats were an issue in the 1990s ogasawara islands ecosystem conservation action plan kanto regional environment office of japan et al 2010 feral goats often destruct vegetation and accelerate soil erosion by grazing and trampling coblentz 1978 coblentz and van vuren 1987 this has occurred on nakoudojima island on this island grassland and denuded areas expanded while deforestation continued hata et al 2007 kachi 2010 in addition feral goats interfere with seabird nesting by trampling nests mcchesney and tershy 1998 chiba et al 2007 because black rats are known to be generalist omnivores they have substantial effects on plants and invertebrates hashimoto 2010 in particular impacts on endemic land snails chiba 2007 endemic insects karube 2010 and small seabirds have been severe jones et al 2008 kawakami et al 2010 however a project for the eradication of invasive goats on the island ended in 1999 hata et al 2007 in addition the eradication of rats is now being planned ogasawara islands ecosystem conservation action plan kanto regional environment office of japan et al 2010 approximately 20 years have passed since the completion of the goat eradication project and it is important to identify changes in the ecosystem resulting from their removal consequently a simulation model reproducing the ecosystem of nakoudojima island was warranted we developed such a model which could reproduce ecosystem conditions on nakoudojima island as disturbed by invasive species yoshida et al submitted using this model we may be able to make strong predictions regarding changes in the ecosystem of nakoudojima island after eradication of invasive species in this study simulations of the eradication of invasive goats and rats were conducted the goals were to identify changes in the post eradication ecosystem and propose a desirable eradication scenario 2 methods 2 1 outline of the model the ecosystem of nakoudojima island prior to the eradication of invasive goats fig 1 was represented using an ecosystem model developed in a previous study and the model s details and parameters are described in appendix method and yoshida et al submitted the nutrient cycle on oceanic islands is characteristically a closed system in a small area that receives an input of necessary nutrient from seabirds hiradate et al 2015 an island ecosystem consists of seabirds plants native and invasive trees and grasses and invertebrate animals primarily arthropods we assume feeding types are herbivorous carnivorous scavenger litter eating and coprophagous only where goat droppings are present an ecosystem includes numerous species and often not much is known about their ecology in the model ecological traits of some of such species are determined by several methods appendix method yoshida et al submitted in general seabirds feed on fish at sea and leave droppings and die on islands the droppings and carcasses decompose over time or are eaten by scavengers and are broken down into nutrient available to plants and stored in below ground sinks plants grow by absorbing only the necessary amount of nutrient plants are classified into herbaceous and woody plants and plants that occupy a similar niche compete against each other the model assumes that herbaceous plants grow faster than woody plants but grow to shorter heights and so cannot compete with woody plants plants are used by herbivorous animals the model assumes only herbivorous invertebrates invasive goats and rats herbivores are preyed on by carnivorous invertebrates and invasive rats our model incorporates the following four processes the growth of animals and plants predator prey relationship detritus decomposition and competition in several forms competition among plant species and seabird species disturbance of seabird nests by goats and trampling of plants by goats and seabirds for the details of the model see appendix method and our previous paper yoshida et al submitted variables are explained in full detail below parameter values supported by the literature were used where possible and where relevant literature was not available e g traits of species that have not been studied in detail values considered reasonable by an expert were estimated and iterative simulations were used to determine values that reproduce the actual island ecosystems appendix method yoshida et al submitted 2 2 simulation of eradication of invasive species the eradication began 10 000 days after the start of the simulation in this study three various scenarios were used only goats are eradicated only rats are eradicated both goats and rats are eradicated in simulating the eradication of goats a constant amount of goat biomass was removed daily from the virtual ecosystem in this research we ran a simulation assuming that 40 kg of biomass was removed on a daily basis at this removal rate the eradication was completed in approximately 100 days the actual goat eradication on the island was performed intermittently and completion required approximately one year the eradication pressure used in this simulation was believed to be stronger than the actual eradication pressure used for the goat population the adopted removal rate was chosen because a lower rate may have resulted in failure to eradicate the goats the simulation assumed that the eradicated goats remained in the ecosystem as carcasses as it occurred in the actual eradication project rats have been eradicated on many islands however they are difficult to eradicate and such attempts often fail harper and bunburyb 2015 holmes et al 2015 keitt et al 2015 russell and holmes 2015 amos et al 2016 in the ogasawara islands a previous attempt to eradicate rats on nishijima island failed reasons for the difficulty to eradicate rats include their high fertility the difficulty in capturing them due to their agility and their small size which allows them to use hiding spaces such as gaps between rocks and reduces the catch efficiency at low population densities the process of catching rats under these conditions can be described as a holling iii functional response ito et al 1992 therefore in this study the simulation assumed that workers engaging in the eradication project would remove rat biomass in accordance with the following equation holling iii type yamamura et al 1978 d e d t k m m 2 c m 2 where de dt biomass removed per unit hour k interaction coefficient between eradication workers and rats m biomass of eradication workers m biomass of rats c constant reflects handling time in this study k 0 3 m 3 assuming the involvement of 50 workers and c 0 5 were used the removed biomass remained in the ecosystem as carcasses the efforts for eradicating rats continued until the end of the simulation as a result rats were not eradicated but the biomass of rats was reduced to 1 10 compared with the original status table 1 see the total biomass of rat after eradication of rat for each scenario a 10 000 day observation period was set and the final status was compared among the scenarios the simulation was run 1000 times for each scenario 3 results 3 1 changes in the ecosystem between pre and post eradication fig 2 shows the changes in vegetation ratio between pre and post eradication before the eradication grassland was the dominant vegetation and approximately 24 of the island was without vegetation fig 2 the value was compatible to the real data measured by hata et al 2007 yoshida et al submitted when only goats were eradicated the vegetation improved dramatically and bare ground disappeared transforming almost the entire island into a forested area fig 2 when only rats were eradicated grassland was the dominant vegetation however the vegetation did not improve as much as it did for the eradication of goats leaving 7 of the island without vegetation fig 2 when both goats and rats were eradicated bare ground disappeared almost entirely and grassland and forested areas accounted for 50 each of the island s area on average fig 2 however compared with other scenarios where goats and rats were eradicated separately the standard deviation was considerably higher table 1 fig 2 the changes in the entire ecosystem are summarized in table 1 and fig 3 when goats were eradicated the amount of nutrient salt in the soil and the amount of litter increased noticeably table 1 fig 3a on the other hand both the number and biomass of invertebrate species decreased specifically the number of herbivorous invertebrate species decreased by approximately 24 table 1 fig 3a for carnivorous invertebrates the number of species decreased by 31 and the biomass decreased by 56 table 1 fig 3a the number of forest nesting seabird species increased but a decrease was observed for grassland nesting seabird species resulting in an overall decrease in the number of seabird species table 1 fig 3a however the biomass increased significantly for both grassland nesting and forest nesting seabirds with the latter exhibiting a more pronounced increase table 1 fig 3a while 11 of woody plants became extinct the number of herbaceous plant species decreased significantly to 18 compared to pre eradication table 1 fig 3a while the biomass of woody plants increased significantly the biomass of herbaceous plants decreased to a near extinction level table 1 fig 3a after the eradication of goats the biomass of rats increased more than five fold table 1 fig 3a white popinacs increased significantly with a 10 fold increase in biomass and a 14 fold increase in area table 1 fig 3a when rats were eradicated the biomass of carnivorous invertebrates increased significantly table 1 fig 3b in addition the amount of nutrient salt the biomass of herbaceous plants and the biomass of herbivorous invertebrates increased slightly table 1 fig 3b however many parameters exhibited little recovery or worsened compared with pre eradication table 1 fig 3b these results indicated that it was not desirable to eradicate only rats when goats and rats were eradicated simultaneously many parameters showed a marked increase table 1 fig 3c in addition the rate of increase in white popinacs was reduced compared to a scenario where only goats were eradicated table 1 fig 3c these results indicated that recovery effects were highest when goats and rats were eradicated simultaneously however the number of herbivorous invertebrates decreased by approximately 20 and the number of herbaceous plants decreased by approximately 42 table 1 fig 3c 3 2 vegetation changes for the simultaneous eradication of goats and rats detailed analysis was performed concerning the resulting vegetation following the simultaneous eradication of goats and rats grasslands and forests accounted for an average of 50 each of the total area fig 2 however results did not correspond to the average fig 4 out of 1000 simulations nearly the entire island changed to grassland 421 times but for 468 times the ratio of grassland lower than 10 fig 4 out of these 468 simulations nearly the entire island became forested 459 times and became denuded called crashed ecosystem see below section 3 4 these results showed that following the simultaneous eradication of goats and rats the ecosystem became bi stable resulting in the entire island to become either forest or grassland dominated to examine whether it was possible to predict whether forests or grasslands became dominant after the simultaneous eradication of goats and rats the pre eradication characteristics of the forest and grassland ecosystems were compared strongly significant statistical differences 99 9 were observed only for the number of species and the biomass of carnivorous invertebrates table 2 slightly significant statistical differences 95 were observed for the total amount of litter that of biomass of tree rat and white popinac table 2 a comparison of the biomass of herbivorous invertebrates in the forest and grassland ecosystems after the simultaneous eradication of goats and rats indicated that the biomass of herbivorous invertebrates was twice as high in the grasslands compared to the forests mean biomass of herbivorous invertebrates in the grassland was 22 28 s d 16 67 and in the forest was 11 06 s d 9 20 3 3 results with large standard deviations as with the vegetation rate mentioned in section 3 2 the amounts of nutrients and litter and biomass of herbivorous invertebrates and seabirds also had large standard deviations after the eradication of goats and rats table 1 the total seabird biomass after eradication was widely distributed from 0 to 90 appendix fig 1a as a result it exhibited a large standard deviation table 1 in addition it had a strong peak in the interval from 40 to 45 appendix fig 1a appendix fig 1b represents the distribution of the biomass of grassland nesting seabirds this distribution had two peaks the interval from 40 to 45 and that from 0 to 5 appendix fig 1b when the entire area of the island was covered by grassland in the model the biomass of grassland nesting seabirds reached a maximum carrying capacity approximately 45 and that of forest nesting seabirds was 0 conversely when the island was covered by forest the biomass of grassland nesting seabirds was 0 and that of forest nesting birds reached the maximum value because the ecosystem became bi stable fig 4 the total biomass of seabirds was approximately 45 in most cases appendix fig 1a in 111 cases of 1000 simulations forest and grassland coexisted neither coverage ratio exceeded 90 in such cases the total biomass of seabirds was greater than 45 because the two types of seabirds coexisted the maximum biomass of seabirds was 85 6 in rare cases vegetation on the island was not restored and a wide denuded area remained in 9 cases of 1000 simulations the ratio of vegetation area did not exceed 80 as mentioned below in such cases the seabird biomass declined the minimum was 3 97 therefore seabird biomass was widely distributed from near 0 to 90 the distribution of the amount of nutrients after eradication of goats and rats had two peaks with intervals from 0 to 100 and from 500 to 700 appendix fig 2 then we compared the two types of ecosystems for which the amount of nutrients after eradication was less than 100 or was larger than 500 ecosystems having a low amount of nutrients had a larger ratio of forest appendix table 1 such ecosystems had smaller numbers of grass species and grassland nesting seabird species appendix table 1 indicating forest expansion such ecosystems also had greater species diversity and biomass of carnivorous invertebrates and a lower biomass of herbivorous invertebrates these features are compatible with those of forested ecosystems after eradication table 2 these results indicate that nutrients in forested ecosystems were stored in aboveground parts of the forest and not in belowground reservoirs because forests had a much larger biomass aboveground than did grasslands in fact the amount of nutrients in forested ecosystems was negatively related to tree biomass appendix fig 3 as mentioned above after eradication of goats and rats vegetation and seabird biomass in ecosystems were restored fig 3 and table 1 consequently the nutrient supply was increased in the case of grassland ecosystems nutrient supply was stored in belowground reservoirs then the value of the amounts of nutrients increased conversely in the case of forest ecosystems nutrients were converted from the belowground reservoirs to tree biomass then the value of the amounts of nutrients decreased the distribution litter after eradication exhibited two peaks at intervals from 0 to 400 and from 1000 to 1500 appendix fig 4 we compared two types of ecosystems for which the amount of litter after eradication was less than 400 or was greater than 1000 appendix table 2 the most remarkable difference between them was in the vegetation ecosystems having a small amount of litter were covered by grasslands on the other hand those having a large amount of litter were covered by forests other differences in characteristics between ecosystems with small or large amounts of litter were similar to the aforementioned case for amounts of nutrients appendix table 1 it appeared that forests produce greater amounts of litter than grasslands because forests have a large amount of biomass per unit area then we analyzed the relationship between the amount of plant biomass and that of litter appendix fig 5 the amount of litter was positively related to that of plant biomass in addition it was obvious that forested ecosystems had greater amounts of plant biomass and litter and grassland ecosystems have smaller amounts this result clearly indicated that the amount of litter was strongly controlled by vegetation type the amount of biomass of herbivorous invertebrates also exhibited a large standard deviation table 1 the distribution of biomass of herbivorous invertebrates exhibited a peak in the interval from 5 to 10 and was skewed to the right then we compared the two types of ecosystems for which the biomass of herbivorous invertebrates was in the interval from 5 to 10 or was greater than 30 appendix table 3 ecosystems having a smaller biomass of herbivorous invertebrates had a lower diversity of grass species greater diversity and biomass of carnivorous invertebrates and a smaller ratio of grasslands their features were similar to those of ecosystems that had small amounts of nutrients appendix table 1 and a large amount of litter appendix table 2 that is ecosystems covered by forest after eradication of goats and rats table 2 in fact of 337 ecosystems for which the biomass of herbivorous invertebrates was in the interval from 5 to 10 225 ecosystems were almost completely covered by forest the ratio of forest was greater than 90 and 169 ecosystems were completely covered by forest the ratio of forest was 100 3 4 crashed ecosystems of 1000 simulated ecosystems vegetation of 9 ecosystems was not restored after the eradication of goats and rats these are called crashed ecosystems it is very important to predict such undesirable results before eradication thus we analyzed the properties prior to eradication for these crashed ecosystems as compared with other ecosystems crashed ecosystems had small amounts of nutrients low diversity of grass species a small ratio of grassland areas low diversity and biomass of animal species a large ratio of denuded areas and a high ratio and biomass of white popinac forest table 3 these results indicated that crashed ecosystems before eradication were destroyed by invasive species to a greater extent than were other ecosystems we investigated changes in 9 crashed ecosystems after eradication of goats and rats after eradication the forest area fluctuated rapidly and strongly fig 5 a such fluctuation was never observed in ecosystems that did not crash the first pulse of forest primarily consisted of white popinac fig 5b forest area 30 93 area of white popinac 27 80 the fluctuation pattern of biomass of herbivorous invertebrates was similar but slightly delayed relative to that of forest areas fig 5a c this result indicated that the fluctuation pattern of forest areas was mainly controlled by herbivorous invertebrates when the ecosystem was completely covered by forest approximately the 14 500th time step fig 5b grass species went extinct after that the forest rapidly declined once more but the rapid and strong fluctuation in forest area ceased and forest area increased very slightly fig 5a then large denuded areas remained 4 discussion 4 1 implications for the behavior of the model system it is well known that invasive mammals severely disturb species in invaded ecosystems e g elton 1958 williamson 1996 courchamp et al 2003 kachi 2010 then after eradication of invasive mammals the biomass and observable number of species were increased as compared with the pre eradication state plants hamann 1975 1979 hata et al 2007 2010 2014 seabirds robertson et al 1994 kawakami et al 2010 invertebrates lorvelec and pascal 2005 the same tendencies were observed in the simulations in this study table 1 fig 3 from these results it is considered that the model in this study could reproduce substantial properties of natural ecosystems fig 6 shows a simplified schematic diagram of the interactions in the ecosystem represented in the model if only goats are eradicated their feeding pressure decreases thereby improving the vegetation fig 6b in addition the disturbance of nesting sites caused by goats decreases facilitating the reproduction of seabirds table 1 fig 3 as a result the supply of nutrient salts increases significantly due to the increase in seabirds feces and carcasses table 1 fig 3 thereby accelerating revegetation if goats are eradicated the biomass of rats that compete with goats for food increases table 1 figs 3 and 6b if rats increase their feeding pressure on invertebrates increases fig 6b thereby reducing the number and biomass of invertebrate species table 1 fig 3 if herbivorous invertebrates decrease their feeding pressure on plants decreases fig 6b further promoting revegetation some organisms are affected negatively by an increase in rats while rats prey on seabirds they eat only small birds kawakami et al 2010 in other words the biomass of seabirds as a whole is not greatly affected therefore if goats are eradicated the supply of nutrient salts increases significantly table 1 fig 3 and becomes the driving force behind revegetation rats being omnivorous feed on plants and the rats feeding pressure on plants naturally increases however because rats also prey on other animals their feeding pressure on plants does not increase significantly because herbivorous invertebrates also decrease it is believed that the feeding pressure on plants would decrease compared to when goats are present why does the entire island become forested when goats are eradicated this is due to the decrease in the feeding pressure on plants fig 6b creating conditions where both herbaceous and woody plants can increase as a result herbaceous and woody plants compete with each other and the taller woody plants outcompete the herbaceous plants as a result the entire island becomes dominated by forest compared with the case where only goats are eradicated the ecosystem does not improve if only rats are eradicated table 1 fig 3 the most important reason for this outcome is that the number of goats remains the same goats feed on a wide range of plants and disturb seabird nesting sites fig 1 therefore the vegetation is damaged and the number of seabirds the driving force behind the improvement in the ecosystem does not increase if rats are removed invertebrates increase table 1 fig 3 and an increase in herbivorous invertebrates has a negative effect on revegetation as a result the vegetation does not improve entirely leaving bare patches of land table 1 figs 2 and 3 if both goats and rats are eradicated simultaneously on average most parameters will improve significantly table 1 fig 3 compared with the case where only goats are eradicated the rate of increase in white popinacs is reduced therefore it is desirable to eradication goats and rats simultaneously however there is a possibility that as forests improve the grassland area decreases which reduces the number of herbaceous plant species and grassland nesting seabird species these potential problems may call for the implementation of additional measures as pointed out by okochi 2009 the problem with the simultaneous eradication of goats and rats is that the post eradication ecosystem is likely to progress to one of two extreme outcomes either grassland or forested fig 4 this likely results from several parameters amounts of nutrients and litter biomass of herbivorous invertebrates and that of seabirds which had large standard deviations see results 3 3 and table 1 because the amount of litter and biomass of seabirds were directly influenced by vegetation and the amount of nutrients were directly affected by the biomass of seabirds regarding the biomass of herbivorous invertebrates see below the difficulty in predicting the final state of the ecosystem can pose a significant problem for managing the ecosystem therefore the resulting grassland and forest ecosystems were analyzed in terms of the pre eradication differences between the two the only strongly significant differences 99 9 found were the number and biomass of carnivorous invertebrate species table 2 if goats and rats are eradicated simultaneously plants and invertebrates do not experience the feeding pressure fig 6d the point is that following the eradication the herbivorous invertebrates directly control whether the island becomes forest or grassland and the woody plants outcompete the herbaceous plants due to their slow growth that makes them susceptible to feeding damage caused by the animals fig 6d prior to the eradication of goats and rats the invertebrates lived under rather harsh conditions on the island due to the high feeding pressure of rats and low plant biomass the herbivorous invertebrates cannot increase table 1 before eradication state this means that carnivorous invertebrates also cannot increase in biomass as a result when goats and rats are present the number of invertebrate species decreases rather significantly how the carnivorous invertebrates survive under these conditions determines the fate of the ecosystem fig 7 if goats and rats are eradicated the island s vegetation begins to improve herbivorous invertebrates start reproducing as the availability of prey improves and as they are free from the feeding pressures of rats if a sufficient number of carnivorous invertebrates remain the reproduction of herbivorous invertebrates is suppressed as a result woody plants and herbaceous plants propagate without being affected by herbivorous invertebrates and compete with each other fig 6d as a result woody plants outcompete the herbaceous plants and the island becomes forested figs 6d 7 if a sufficient number of carnivorous invertebrates are not present after the eradication of goats and rats the opposite process occurs fig 7 if only a small number of carnivorous invertebrates are present after the eradication of goats and rats the propagation of herbivorous invertebrates cannot be suppressed fig 5 6d 7 as a result while plants experience strong feeding pressure woody plants are more susceptible to feeding damage due to their lower proliferation potential therefore forests decline turning almost the entire island into grassland what does control the number of species and the amount of biomass of carnivorous invertebrate the total amount of biomass of rat may control them it is not a clear conclusion because the difference was small table 2 carnivorous invertebrates were prone to go extinct by the feeding pressure of rats because the biomass per single species of carnivorous invertebrate is much smaller than that of herbivorous invertebrate carnivore 0 114 herbivore 0 218 calculated from table 1 therefore the number of species of carnivorous invertebrate became smaller when the total biomass of rat was large the difference in the total amount of biomass of tree in table 2 was mainly depended on that of white popinac tree species other than white popinac could not increase by the strong feeding pressure of goats and rats however because white popinac has a large growth rate yoshida et al submitted it could slightly increase its biomass by the process shown in fig 7 the difference in the total amount of litter may be the result 4 2 crashed ecosystems although it was rare the model ecosystem could crash after eradication of goats and rats fig 5 for formulation of an ecological restoration plan it is very important to avoid such unfavorable results before eradication crashed ecosystems had a lower amount of nutrients low species diversities for invertebrates and plants a smaller area of grasslands and a larger area of white popinac table 3 in most cases ecosystems with a low species diversity for invertebrates became grasslands table 2 however in crashed ecosystems white popinac rapidly increases after eradication of goats and rats fig 5 white popinac is a pioneer tree species that has the ability to fix nitrogen jayasundara et al 1997 therefore white popinac can rapidly increase before the eradication state of crashed ecosystems leaving a large denuded area and a small amount of nutrients table 3 this rapid increase is considered a perturbation in crashed ecosystems that is strong enough to overcome the resilience of the ecosystems and then a so called regime shift e g scheffer et al 2001 occurred therefore in the crashed ecosystems there were rapid fluctuations with strong magnitudes in forest areas and in the biomass of herbivorous invertebrates fig 5a c when the forest area reached 100 grass species went extinct after that grassland never expanded even when forest declined then a large denuded area remained why did the fluctuations in forest area stop the fluctuations in forest area was strongly controlled by the amount of herbivorous invertebrates fig 5a c these were also affected by carnivorous invertebrates and grasses if forest area increases fig 8 a the biomass of herbivores increases fig 8b in this situation carnivorous invertebrates shift their feeding effort to herbivores of trees fig 8c the forest area decreases because of the high grazing pressure by herbivores of trees fig 8d the biomass of herbivores of trees is reduced by predation pressure by carnivores and the lack of food fig 8e if forest area decreases and the grassland area can expand fig 8d then the biomass of herbivores of grasses increases fig 8e therefore carnivorous invertebrates shift their feeding effort to herbivores of grasses fig 8f if the biomass of herbivores of trees is reduced forest can expand again fig 8a if forest area reaches 100 grasses go extinct e g approximately the 14 500th step in fig 5a at that time the cycle shown in fig 8 is stopped and the fluctuation of forest area does not occur again 4 3 today s nakoudojima island and further work on the real nakoudojima island only goats were eradicated in this case this study predicted that the island would be covered by forest table 1 figs 2 3 this was also observed on the galapagos islands sample plots test hamann 1975 1979 in fact the forest area on the island is expanding but the main component of the forest is white popinac osawa et al 2015 in addition the vegetation has not yet recovered although over 15 years have passed since the eradication of goats one of the reasons for the slow pace of vegetation recovery is soil erosion hata et al 2019 colonization of seedlings is directly interfered with by soil erosion in addition soil erosion exposes the subsoil which has a high value for soil exchange acidity and a smaller amount of nutrients under such conditions it is difficult for most plants to grow except for white popinac which has the ability to fix nitrogen jayasundara et al 1997 today s nakoudojima is in a condition similar to that of crashed ecosystems that is there is an increase in white popinac area and a small amount of nutrients table 3 fig 5b however strong fluctuations in forest area fig 5a have not been observed thus the ecosystem on nakoudojima island may not have crashed this study suggests that invasive goats and rats should be eradicated simultaneously table 1 figs 2 3 similar results were obtained in several previous studies caut et al 2007 griffiths 2011 innes and saunders 2011 glen et al 2013 thus this is considered to be a general conclusion however this is not always possible because of multiple reasons e g the budget limitation in this case it is very important to determine an adequate schedule for eradication because if an inadequate schedule is adopted native species may be in a critical situation okochi 2009 as the number of related species increases determining an eradication schedule becomes more difficult in such cases computer simulation is one of the most helpful methods and this study has already begun e g bode et al 2015 to make more practical plans for eradication of invasive species the issue of an eradication schedule should be considered in further studies 5 conclusion in this study three scenarios for eradicating invasive goats and rats were examined the results showed that while some level of ecosystem recovery could be expected from eradicating only goats it was desirable to eradication goats and rats simultaneously however in this scenario it may be necessary to give special care to herbaceous plants and grassland nesting seabirds in addition when goats and rats were eradicated simultaneously one of two extreme outcomes occurred the entire island became dominated by forest or grassland therefore it is suggested that instead of only setting the goal of eradicating the invasive species to conserve the island s ecosystem it is necessary to monitor post eradication changes in the ecosystem while taking adaptive measures as required acknowledgement this study was supported by grant in aid for scientific research a no 24710038 25241025 16h01794 from the japan society for the promotion of science we thank
