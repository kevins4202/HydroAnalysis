anjali and sabumon 2017 valiente et al 2022 nevertheless from the perspective of sustainable wastewater treatment light energy is possible to be utilized to produce nitrite substrate for anammox reaction via constructing phototroph anammox symbiotic nitrogen removal system manser et al 2016 successfully established a symbiotic nitrogen removal reactor with microalgae ammonia oxidizing bacteria and anammox bacteria microalgae produced oxygen through photosynthesis and achieved stable nitrogen removal without the need for aeration and external electron donor addition zhang et al 2022 constructed an algal partial nitrification anammox biofilm system by light culture it has achieved effective nitrogen removal by algae and nitrifying bacteria on the outer while anammox bacteria on

semiconductor would also interact with anammox consortia and mitigate its photo oxidative damage previous studies have shown that selenium compounds exhibited antioxidant properties ji et al 2013 xu et al 2013 selenium can combine with proteins to produce important selenoproteins that act as antioxidant enzymes newton et al 2021 herein it might also be possible to scavenge ros for anammox sludge under light irradiation the main objective of this study was to fabricate nano semiconductor doped inorganic biological hybrid system for stable nitrogen removal under high intensity light irradiation the selenium doped carbon quantum dots se cqds were synthesized and its optical property was initially evaluated then the improvement of se cqds on anammox sludge activity under high intensity solar simulated light illumination was evaluated after examining the metabolic and enzymatic response of microorganism to semiconductor the behind interaction mechanism was explored 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation and characterization of se cqds se cqds were prepared by a hydrothermal carbonization method using selenocysteine as carbon source briefly 150 mg selenocysteine was dissolved in 10 ml

experiment setup the anammox granular sludge used in this study was obtained from an upflow sludge blanket reactor which has been stably operated in our laboratory for more than two years the batch photo irradiation experiment was carried out by using a 100 ml quartz bottle solar simulated illumination 50 000 lux provided by a xenon lamp was imposed on sludge the xenon lamp wavelength output parameter was 200 780 nm and spectral output range was 200 2500 nm the temperature was controlled at 35 1 c by a circulating water bath in this work medium consisting of nitrogen substrate 100 mg l 1 nh4 n 100 mg l 1 no2 n inorganic salt solution and trace elements was used and the initial ph was controlled between 7 45 and 7 55 jin et al 2013 se cqds with a content of 0 25 0 32 0 38 0 42 and 0 50 ml g 1 volatile suspended solid vss were added into the above mixture respectively anammox sludge was added to the quartz bottle and aerated with argon for 10 min to provide an anaerobic environment in comparison additional controls i e dark conditions and light irradiation without se cqds dosage were also set in this study three parallel treatments were set for each group and the results were expressed as average standard deviation to explore the free radical scavenging ability of se cqds terephthalic acid was selected as an oh probe and its concentration change was measured during the photo illumination process also electron paramagnetic resonance epr bruker a300 x band spectrometer ger was applied to analyze the scavenging effect of se cqds on photo generated ros by using 5 5 dimethy l 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo as a oh probe 2 3 determination of sludge metabolic activity and quantification of functional genes in this work the nitrogen removal activity of sludge was evaluated by measuring the specific anammox activity saa yang and jin 2013 zhang et al 2016 extraction and analysis of ros i e o2 h2o2 oh and oh probe o26 enzyme activity i e gsh px t sod cat and malondialdehyde mda were performed using kits following the manufacturers instructions the electron transport system activity etsa of anammox sludge was determined by the redox dye iodonitrotetrazolium chloride wan et al 2016 sludge extracellular polymer substances eps were extracted by the thermal extraction method and the lowry and anthrone method were applied to determine the protein humic substance and polysaccharide contents respectively li et al 2018 the ladderane lipids components of anammox sludge were extracted by sequentially ultrasonic treatment with methanol methylene chloride and phosphate buffer solution an ultra high performance liquid chromatography triple quadrupole mass spectrometer uplc i class xevo tq s micro waters usa was used for the determination of the ladderane lipids the specific determination method of ladderane lipids was shown in table s1 after a batch photo irradiation test sludge samples were collected to extract dna by using the power soil dna kit mobio laboratories usa three functional genes hzsa hdh and nirs were selected and quantified through quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr quantstudio 3 applied biosystems usa the detailed experimental procedures of qpcr were described in a previous report yin et al 2016 the primers used in the experiment are detailed in table s2 2 4 other analysis scanning electron microscopy sem em 30 plus usa and transmission electron microscopy tem hitachi ht7700 jpn were used to observe the morphology of anammox sludge cultivated under different conditions the chemical elements of sludge quantum dots mixture were screened by an energy dispersive spectrometer eds oxford x max uk fluorescence microscopy nikon eclipse ni u jpn was applied to examine the distribution of se cqds on sludge surface by setting a specific wavelength the routine tests including nh4 n no3 n no2 n suspended solids vss and ph were determined by referencing to standard methods greenberg et al 2005 heme c was quantified by a pyridine heme spectrophotometry method tang et al 2011 changes in the relative content of oh were detected by terephthalic acid photoluminescence method yu et al 2022 the titanium sulfate colorimetric method was used to measure the h2o2 concentration eisenberg 1943 the details of band structure and quantum efficiency estimation of se cqds can be found in si 3 results 3 1 the morphologic and chemical properties of se cqds the morphology and size of se cqds were characterized by collecting hrtem images as shown in fig 1 a the particle size of the as synthesized se cqds was between 3 and 13 nm with an average size of 6 3 nm the proportion of se cqds with a size of approximate 6 nm was the highest accounting for 21 of the total particles a typical lattice spacing of 2 5 å was observed fig 1b the structure and composition of se cqds was further analyzed by xps spectrum and results indicate that the se cqds are mainly composed of carbon nitrogen oxygen and selenium fig s1 the xps spectrum of c 1s exhibited four main peaks at a binding energy of 284 70 284 30 ev 285 20 ev and 287 80 ev which ascribes to graphite sp2 c c se c o and c n bonds respectively yang et al 2015 peaks of 398 90 ev and 400 10 ev in the n 1s spectrum normally ascribes to the pyridine nitrogen and pyrrole nitrogen structures the se 3d spectrum showed the presence of c se bonds li et al 2017 afm analysis revealed that the as prepared se cqds are monodisperse with a height between 0 5 and 3 nm fig 1c the band structure of se cqds was analyzed by ultraviolet vis spectra and xps valence band spectra the absorption edge of se cqds is 407 nm which indicated that its main absorption range is in the ultraviolet range fig s2a the band gap of se cqds analyzed by tauc plot was about 3 02 ev fig s2b guan et al 2013 fig s2c showed the valence band spectrum of se cqds the top of the valence band of se cqds is about 2 87 ev thus the bottom of the conduction band of se cqds was calculated to be 0 15 ev fig s2d also the quantum efficiency of se cqds was estimated as 8 17 the stability test results of se cqds are shown in fig s4 the results showed that the as prepared se cqds exhibited a good stability sem images fig s5 show that bacteria were contracted after light illumination which may indicate the photo inhibition on their growth quantum dots could greatly mitigate the above situation implying its potential protective role to anammox sludge tem images clearly showed that se cqds evenly distributed inside and outside of the cell fig 1d in comparing to the sludge without quantum dots treatment fig 1e also eds spot scanning showed that the selenium element was existed within the cell while no se related signal was observed in the control sample fig s6 in addition fluorescence microscopy images show that under the maximum excitation wavelength blue fluorescence was observed in the system with added se cqds fig 1f while there was a weak fluorescence signal in the system without se cqds fig s7 the above results clearly showed that the as prepared se cqds was closely bind to anammox bacteria 3 2 photo oxidative damage on anammox granule and its mitigation by se cqds as shown in fig 2 a sludge saa declined by 29 7 5 2 after irradiating at 50 000 lux solar simulated light for 4 h this result clearly implied that an intense light would induce strong inhibition on anammox sludge activity saa increased gradually with increased dosage of se cqds into system and reached a maximum value at 0 42 ml g 1 vss dosage which corresponded to approximate 102 9 4 8 that of the dark condition this indicated that the inhibition effect of light on anammox sludge can be restored to a certain extent by the addition of se cqds however further increase of se cqds dosage to 0 50 ml g 1 vss would result in sludge activity decline accounting for approximate 91 2 5 0 of the saa that in the dark system a possible reason is that high content of se cqds might impose inherent bio toxicity to sludge oh et al 2016 under dark condition once se cqds content increased to 0 50 ml g 1 vss sludge saa decreased significantly to 78 11 2 fig s8 which supported the above assumption to explore the influence of wavelength on the activity of anammox sludge a batch light irradiation experiment by using different optical filters was conducted fig 2b it was observed that saa decreased to 251 2 4 1 mg n g 1 vss d 1 under full spectrum light irradiation compared with that obtained in darkness 364 0 5 1 mg n g 1 vss d 1 saa reached to 303 2 0 3 mg n g 1 vss d 1 under ultraviolet light λ 420 nm and increased to 344 1 17 3 mg n g 1 vss d 1under visible light λ 420 nm this indicated that the activity of anammox sludge was mainly inhibited by ultraviolet light saa substantially recovered to 342 1 0 3 mg n g 1 vss d 1 after addition of 0 42 ml g 1 vss se cqds under ultraviolent light irridiation which proved again for its protective role the photoluminescence test showed that se cqds exhibited a maximum excitation and emission wavelength at 385 nm and 485 nm respectively fig 2c se cqds are possibly excited by ultraviolet light and then emitted visible light which partially alleviated the photo inhibition on anammox sludge microorganisms undergo a series of complex physiological changes when they are subjected to stress sludge eps content was commonly changed as a response to external stimulus however in the present study a negligible change of eps content was observed after 4 h light illumination fig s9 ladderane lipids on the membrane of anammoxosome were impermeable for poisonous hydrazine which are unique for anammox bacteria moss frank et al 2018 ladderane core lipids can be used not only as biomarkers of amammox bacteria but also as indicators of anammox process that have occurred in the environment zhao et al 2019 the change in the peak area of pentyl 5 ladderane fatty acid methyl ester i was used to represent the change in the relative content of the ladderane core lipids zhao et al 2019 results showed that the ladderane lipids content in light conditions was 61 15 of that in darkness which was consistent with the change in saa fig 2d when 0 25 and 0 42 ml g 1 vss se cqds were added the relative contents of the chromatographic peak area increased to 79 56 and 96 43 of the dark condition respectively therefore as a biomarker of anammox bacteria the change in relative content of pentyl 5 ladderane fatty acid methyl ester i was consistent with the previous results which again verified our hypothesis that the addition of se cqds could protect the anammox sludge from oxidative damage in this study three functional genes hzsa hdh and nirs of anammox bacteria were quantitatively analyzed fig s10 showed that the absolute abundance of hzsa decreased from 4 64 107 2 77 106 dark condition to 2 93 107 5 10 105 copies ng 1 dna light condition the absolute abundance of hdh decreased from 1 07 107 2 81 105 to 5 8 106 3 75 105 copies ng 1 and nirs decreased from 1 65 107 8 17 105 to 9 37 106 5 20 105 copies ng 1 after supplying 0 42 ml g 1 vss se cqds the absolute abundances of hzsa hdh and nirs increased to 4 21 107 7 08 105 9 04 106 5 86 105 and 1 73 107 4 10 104 copies ng 1 respectively hzsa and hdh encode hydrazine synthase and hydrazine dehydrogenase which play important roles in nitrogen conversion and are considered biomarkers of anammox bacteria wu et al 2016 therefore the quantitative analysis of anammox functional genes further verified the inhibitory effect of light on the anammox system and mitigation function of se cqds 3 3 photo induced ros production and cellular antioxidant activity change the increase in intracellular ros content under external stimulation may lead to oxidative stress and cell damage therefore it is particularly important to determine the contents of intracellular ros and lipid peroxidation product i e mda levels in anammox sludge the amount of ros in the light only system increased by 234 8 4 1 compared to that in the dark system fig 3 a however se cqds could significantly attenuate the ros intensity under optimum se cqds dosage 0 42 ml g 1 vss the ros accumulation was reduced to 127 4 7 of that under dark condition therefore we speculated that the anammox sludge activity decline under 50 000 lux illumination was due to excessive intracellular ros production which triggered oxidative stress and damage to bacteria the increase in mda content in the light system also supports this assumption the mda content increased by 112 7 18 8 under light illumination condition after adding 0 42 ml g 1 vss se cqds the mda content decreased by 28 4 2 7 compared with that under dark conditions the decrease in mda content compared with that in the system without se cqds indicates a mitigation in free radical attack on cells which may be because se cqds have a scavenging effect on free radicals produced in the system to verify the responsible species for sludge activity decline the changes in specific ros contents h2o2 oh and o2 in the system were further evaluated among the three oxidative species oh and o2 contents significantly increased after light irradiation fig 3b the oh content increased by 34 5 2 9 compared to that in the dark system while the o2 content increased by 16 9 10 3 se cqds could reduce the content of oh in the system to the same level as that under dark condition the relative contents of o2 and h2o2 were the lowest under the se cqds dosage at 0 38 ml g 1 vss and 0 42 ml g 1 vss respectively the activities of three antioxidant enzymes gsh px t sod and cat were also determined in this study fig 3c these enzymes are related to the decomposition of h2o2 and the scavenging of o2 results showed that the enzyme activities of gsh px t sod and cat after light irradiation respectively decreased by 7 7 13 3 14 1 5 4 and 26 2 8 6 compared with those in the dark system preliminary analysis suggested that high intensity light may induce oxidative stress that disrupted the redox balance and lead to a certain degree of cell death herein the over accumulation of ros would be the possible reason for the declined enzyme activity the increased activity of antioxidant enzymes indicated an enhanced ability of h2o2 decomposition and o2 scavenging therefore anammox sludge could maintain its own redox balance the relative activities of gsh px t sod and cat increased by 15 2 13 3 10 8 5 1 and 11 5 3 5 in the system supplemented with 0 42 ml g 1 vss se cqds compared with that in the dark system in this study the heme c and etsa contents of anammox sludge were also determined fig s11a showed that the relative content of heme c decreased by 31 7 5 7 after sludge being inhibited by light with the addition of se cqds the heme c content increased gradually and reached 98 4 8 9 of that under dark condition in previous reports heme c was strongly correlated with saa ren et al 2022 etsa can indicate the metabolic activity of microorganisms and the degradation performance of pollutants yang et al 2020 in this study the etsa of sludge under light conditions was significantly reduced which was only 67 4 5 2 that of the dark system fig s11b etsa increased with the addition of se cqds which reached to 85 2 in the presence of 0 42 ml g 1 vss se cqds 3 4 the potential radical quenching mechanism by se cqds as a fluorescence probe for semi quantitatively detecting oh terephthalic acid was added into simulative system to explore the potential radical quenching ability of se cqds under 50 000 lux illumination the composite signal of terephthalic acid oh adduct in 3 mm h2o2 solution increased greatly which indicated the production of oh fig 4 a in contrast only a small amount of oh was formed after the addition of se cqds fig 4b epr was further employed to detect the oh changes in both heterogeneous ultraviolent excites tio2 and homogenous photocatalytic ultraviolent activates h2o2 systems as shown in fig 4c a strong signal referring to dmpo oh adduct was observed in the above two systems after adding se cqds the signal disappeared in addition oh probe o26 was used to label oh in anammox bacterial cells and sludge was observed by fluorescence microscopy fig s12 results showed that an obvious green fluorescence generated after exposing sludge at light irradiation fig s12e indicating a high content of oh was formed in comparison the green fluorescent intensity was greatly reduced after dosing se cqds proving good its good quenching ability towards ros consequently se cqds have a superior scavenging effect on oh which mitigated the photo oxidative damage on sludge to explore whether light was involved in ros quenching fenton system was constructed under dark condition and terephthalic acid was used to probe the change of oh content in the system as shown in the fig 4d the fluorescence intensity of oh was significantly decreased with supply of se cqds into system herein se cqds reacted as a strong reducing agent to directly remove oh without the need for light activation 4 discussion ros are mostly produced by continuous single electron transfer reactions of oxygen molecules catalyzed by enzymes in the respiratory chain o2 can be converted spontaneously or enzymatically by superoxide dismutase sod to h2o2 borisov et al 2021 under external stimulation h2o2 produced by microorganisms can cross the cell membrane and combine with fe2 to generate the strong oxidant oh through fenton like reaction glaeser et al 2011 since bacteria also possess endogenous photosensitizers a high intensity light can produce a large amount of ros which inhibits their activity flavin cofactors are present in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase ii of the respiratory chain which also are able to react with molecular oxygen to produce h2o2 and o2 messner and imlay 1999 generally intracellular antioxidant enzyme system was essential to maintain redox homeostasis sod decomposes o2 into h2o2 or o2 h2o2 is further decomposed into h2o by cat and gsh px fig 5 however due to the high content of heme c of anammox bacteria the fenton like reaction mediated oh content was high which would in turn attack enzyme system fig 3c and possibly cause cell apoptosis or necrosis zhang et al 2014 herein an increased lipid peroxide product content was observed fig 3a more importantly ladderane lipid structure was damaged fig 2d and functional genes abundances were declined fig s8 leading to a decreased nitrogen removal activity se cqds were found to greatly mitigate the above oxidative damages for the extracellular interaction between se cqds and anammox cells first the surface attached se cqds were able to partially absorb ultraviolent light fig 2c and emit visible light since the photoinhibition was primarily originated from ultraviolent light the optical property of as prepared se cqds would partially attenuate potential photoinhibition on bacteria once se cqds penetrated into cells fig 1d it can effectively scavenge oh and mitigate the oxidative stress under the optimal dosage antioxidant enzymes activities recovered fig 3c and lipid peroxide level declined figs 2d and 3a which resulted in a sludge activity recovery recent studies also found that the selenium containing compounds exhibited antioxidant properties domínguez álvarez et al 2022 herein benefiting from the extracellular and intracellular interaction with microbial cells se cqds would maintain a redox homeostasis and mitigate cellular photoinhibition 5 conclusions the specific anammox activity decreased by 29 7 5 2 and reactive oxygen species ros content increased by 134 8 4 1 under 50 000 lux light oh and o2 were identified as the leading ros inducing lipid peroxidation and antioxidase function detriment also the structure of ladderane lipids located on anammoxosome was destroyed by ros and functional genes abundances declined accordingly sludge activity could be completely recovered under the optimum dosage of 0 42 ml g 1 vss se cqds the added se cqds was efficient to absorb ultraviolent light and scavenge oxidative ros which could greatly mitigate the photooxidative damage caused on anammox granule the findings of this work provide in depth understanding the metabolic

parameter was 200 780 nm and spectral output range was 200 2500 nm the temperature was controlled at 35 1 c by a circulating water bath in this work medium consisting of nitrogen substrate 100 mg l 1 nh4 n 100 mg l 1 no2 n inorganic salt solution and trace elements was used and the initial ph was controlled between 7 45 and 7 55 jin et al 2013 se cqds with a content of 0 25 0 32 0 38 0 42 and 0 50 ml g 1 volatile suspended solid vss were added into the above mixture respectively anammox sludge was added to the quartz bottle and aerated with argon for 10 min to provide an anaerobic environment in comparison additional controls i e dark conditions and light irradiation without se cqds dosage were also set in this study three parallel treatments were set for each group and the results were expressed as average standard deviation to explore the free radical scavenging ability of se cqds terephthalic acid was selected as an oh probe and its concentration change was measured during the photo illumination process also electron paramagnetic resonance epr bruker a300 x band spectrometer ger was applied to analyze the scavenging effect of se cqds on photo generated ros by using 5 5 dimethy l 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo as a oh probe 2 3 determination of sludge metabolic activity and quantification of functional genes in this work the nitrogen removal activity of sludge was evaluated by measuring the specific anammox activity saa yang and jin 2013 zhang et al 2016 extraction and analysis of ros i e o2 h2o2 oh and oh probe o26 enzyme activity i e gsh px t sod cat and malondialdehyde mda were performed using kits following the manufacturers instructions the electron transport system activity etsa of anammox sludge was determined by the redox dye iodonitrotetrazolium chloride wan et al 2016 sludge extracellular polymer substances eps were extracted by the thermal extraction method and the lowry and anthrone method were applied to determine the protein humic substance and polysaccharide contents respectively li et al 2018 the ladderane lipids components of anammox sludge were extracted by sequentially ultrasonic treatment with methanol methylene chloride and phosphate buffer solution an ultra high performance liquid chromatography triple quadrupole mass spectrometer uplc i class xevo tq s micro waters usa was used for the determination of the ladderane lipids the specific determination method of ladderane lipids was shown in table s1 after a batch photo irradiation test sludge samples were collected to extract dna by using the power soil dna kit mobio laboratories usa three functional genes hzsa hdh and nirs were selected and quantified through quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr quantstudio 3 applied biosystems usa the detailed experimental procedures of qpcr were described in a previous report yin et al 2016 the primers used in the experiment are detailed in table s2 2 4 other analysis scanning electron microscopy sem em 30 plus usa and transmission electron microscopy tem hitachi ht7700 jpn were used to observe the morphology of anammox sludge cultivated under different conditions the chemical elements of sludge quantum dots mixture were screened by an energy dispersive spectrometer eds oxford x max uk fluorescence microscopy nikon eclipse ni u jpn was applied to examine the distribution of se cqds on sludge surface by setting a specific wavelength the routine tests including nh4 n no3 n no2 n suspended solids vss and ph were determined by referencing to standard methods greenberg et al 2005 heme c was quantified by a pyridine heme spectrophotometry method tang et al 2011 changes in the relative content of oh were detected by terephthalic acid photoluminescence method yu et al 2022 the titanium sulfate colorimetric method was used to measure the h2o2 concentration eisenberg 1943 the details of band structure and quantum efficiency estimation of se cqds can be found in si 3 results 3 1 the morphologic and chemical properties of se cqds the morphology and size of se cqds were characterized by collecting hrtem images as shown in fig 1 a the particle size of the as synthesized se cqds was between 3 and 13 nm with an average size of 6 3 nm the proportion of se cqds with a size of approximate 6 nm was the highest accounting for 21 of the total particles a typical lattice spacing of 2 5 å was observed fig 1b the structure and composition of se cqds was further analyzed by xps spectrum and results indicate that the se cqds are mainly composed of carbon nitrogen oxygen and selenium fig s1 the xps spectrum of c 1s exhibited four main peaks at a binding energy of 284 70 284 30 ev 285 20 ev and 287 80 ev which ascribes to graphite sp2 c c se c o and c n bonds respectively yang et al 2015 peaks of 398 90 ev and 400 10 ev in the n 1s spectrum normally ascribes to the pyridine nitrogen and pyrrole nitrogen structures the se 3d spectrum showed the presence of c se bonds li et al 2017 afm analysis revealed that the as prepared se cqds are monodisperse with a height between 0 5 and 3 nm fig 1c the band structure of se cqds was analyzed by ultraviolet vis spectra and xps valence band spectra the absorption edge of se cqds is 407 nm which indicated that its main absorption range is in the ultraviolet range fig s2a the band gap of se cqds analyzed by tauc plot was about 3 02 ev fig s2b guan et al 2013 fig s2c showed the valence band spectrum of se cqds the top of the valence band of se cqds is about 2 87 ev thus the bottom of the conduction band of se cqds was calculated to be 0 15 ev fig s2d also the quantum efficiency of se cqds was estimated as 8 17 the stability test results of se cqds are shown in fig s4 the results showed that the as prepared se cqds exhibited a good stability sem images fig s5 show that bacteria were contracted after light illumination which may indicate the photo inhibition on their growth quantum dots could greatly mitigate the above situation implying its potential protective role to anammox sludge tem images clearly showed that se cqds evenly distributed inside and outside of the cell fig 1d in comparing to the sludge without quantum dots treatment fig 1e also eds spot scanning showed that the selenium element was existed within the cell while no se related signal was observed in the control sample fig s6 in addition fluorescence microscopy images show that under the maximum excitation wavelength blue fluorescence was observed in the system with added se cqds fig 1f while there was a weak fluorescence signal in the system without se cqds fig s7 the above results clearly showed that the as prepared se cqds was closely bind to anammox bacteria 3 2 photo oxidative damage on anammox granule and its mitigation by se cqds as shown in fig 2 a sludge saa declined by 29 7 5 2 after irradiating at 50 000 lux solar simulated light for 4 h this result clearly implied that an intense light would induce strong inhibition on anammox sludge activity saa increased gradually with increased dosage of se cqds into system and reached a maximum value at 0 42 ml g 1 vss dosage which corresponded to approximate 102 9 4 8 that of the dark condition this indicated that the inhibition effect of light on anammox sludge can be restored to a certain extent by the addition of se cqds however further increase of se cqds dosage to 0 50 ml g 1 vss would result in sludge activity decline accounting for approximate 91 2 5 0 of the saa that in the dark system a possible reason is that high content of se cqds might impose inherent bio toxicity to sludge oh et al 2016 under dark condition once se cqds content increased to 0 50 ml g 1 vss sludge saa decreased significantly to 78 11 2 fig s8 which supported the above assumption to explore the influence of wavelength on the activity of anammox sludge a batch light irradiation experiment by using different optical filters was conducted fig 2b it was observed that saa decreased to 251 2 4 1 mg n g 1 vss d 1 under full spectrum light irradiation compared with that obtained in darkness 364 0 5 1 mg n g 1 vss d 1 saa reached to 303 2 0 3 mg n g 1 vss d 1 under ultraviolet light λ 420 nm and increased to 344 1 17 3 mg n g 1 vss d 1under visible light λ 420 nm this indicated that the activity of anammox sludge was mainly inhibited by ultraviolet light saa substantially recovered to 342 1 0 3 mg n g 1 vss d 1 after addition of 0 42 ml g 1 vss se cqds under ultraviolent light irridiation which proved again for its protective role the photoluminescence test showed that se cqds exhibited a maximum excitation and emission wavelength at 385 nm and 485 nm respectively fig 2c se cqds are possibly excited by ultraviolet light and then emitted visible light which partially alleviated the photo inhibition on anammox sludge microorganisms undergo a series of complex physiological changes when they are subjected to stress sludge eps content was commonly changed as a response to external stimulus however in the present study a negligible change of eps content was observed after 4 h light illumination fig s9 ladderane lipids on the membrane of anammoxosome were impermeable for poisonous hydrazine which are unique for anammox bacteria moss frank et al 2018 ladderane core lipids can be used not only as biomarkers of amammox bacteria but also as indicators of anammox process that have occurred in the environment zhao et al 2019 the change in the peak area of pentyl 5 ladderane fatty acid methyl ester i was used to represent the change in the relative content of the ladderane core lipids zhao et al 2019 results showed that the ladderane lipids content in light conditions was 61 15 of that in darkness which was consistent with the change in saa fig 2d when 0 25 and 0 42 ml g 1 vss se cqds were added the relative contents of the chromatographic peak area increased to 79 56 and 96 43 of the dark condition respectively therefore as a biomarker of anammox bacteria the change in relative content of pentyl 5 ladderane fatty acid methyl ester i was consistent with the previous results which again verified our hypothesis that the addition of se cqds could protect the anammox sludge from oxidative damage in this study three functional genes hzsa hdh and nirs of anammox bacteria were quantitatively analyzed fig s10 showed that the absolute abundance of hzsa decreased from 4 64 107 2 77 106 dark condition to 2 93 107 5 10 105 copies ng 1 dna light condition the absolute abundance of hdh decreased from 1 07 107 2 81 105 to 5 8 106 3 75 105 copies ng 1 and nirs decreased from 1 65 107 8 17 105 to 9 37 106 5 20 105 copies ng 1 after supplying 0 42 ml g 1 vss se cqds the absolute abundances of hzsa hdh and nirs increased to 4 21 107 7 08 105 9 04 106 5 86 105 and 1 73 107 4 10 104 copies ng 1 respectively hzsa and hdh encode hydrazine synthase and hydrazine dehydrogenase which play important roles in nitrogen conversion and are considered biomarkers of anammox bacteria wu et al 2016 therefore the quantitative analysis of anammox functional genes further verified the inhibitory effect of light on the anammox system and mitigation function of se cqds 3 3 photo induced ros production and cellular antioxidant activity change the increase in intracellular ros content under external stimulation may lead to oxidative stress and cell damage therefore it is particularly important to determine the contents of intracellular ros and lipid peroxidation product i e mda levels in anammox sludge the amount of ros in the light only system increased by 234 8 4 1 compared to that in the dark system fig 3 a however se cqds could significantly attenuate the ros intensity under optimum se cqds dosage 0 42 ml g 1 vss the ros accumulation was reduced to 127 4 7 of that under dark condition therefore we speculated that the anammox sludge activity decline under 50 000 lux illumination was due to excessive intracellular ros production which triggered oxidative stress and damage to bacteria the increase in mda content in the light system also supports this assumption the mda content increased by 112 7 18 8 under light illumination condition after adding 0 42 ml g 1 vss se cqds the mda content decreased by 28 4 2 7 compared with that under dark conditions the decrease in mda content compared with that in the system without se cqds indicates a mitigation in free radical attack on cells which may be because se cqds have a scavenging effect on free radicals produced in the system to verify the responsible species for sludge activity decline the changes in specific ros contents h2o2 oh and o2 in the system were further evaluated among the three oxidative species oh and o2 contents significantly increased after light irradiation fig 3b the oh content increased by 34 5 2 9 compared to that in the dark system while the o2 content increased by 16 9 10 3 se cqds could reduce the content of oh in the system to the same level as that under dark condition the relative contents of o2 and h2o2 were the lowest under the se cqds dosage at 0 38 ml g 1 vss and 0 42 ml g 1 vss respectively the activities of three antioxidant enzymes gsh px t sod and cat were also determined in this study fig 3c these enzymes are related to the decomposition of h2o2 and the scavenging of o2 results showed that the enzyme activities of gsh px t sod and cat after light irradiation respectively decreased by 7 7 13 3 14 1 5 4 and 26 2 8 6 compared with those in the dark system preliminary analysis suggested that high intensity light may induce oxidative stress that disrupted the redox balance and lead to a certain degree of cell death herein the over accumulation of ros would be the possible reason for the declined enzyme activity the increased activity of antioxidant enzymes indicated an enhanced ability of h2o2 decomposition and o2 scavenging therefore anammox sludge could maintain its own redox balance the relative activities of gsh px t sod and cat increased by 15 2 13 3 10 8 5 1 and 11 5 3 5 in the system supplemented with 0 42 ml g 1 vss se cqds compared with that in the dark system in this study the heme c and etsa contents of anammox sludge were also determined fig s11a showed that the relative content of heme c decreased by 31 7 5 7 after sludge being inhibited by light with the addition of se cqds the heme c content increased gradually and reached 98 4 8 9 of that under dark condition in previous reports heme c was strongly correlated with saa ren et al 2022 etsa can indicate the metabolic activity of microorganisms and the degradation performance of pollutants yang et al 2020 in this study the etsa of sludge under light conditions was significantly reduced which was only 67 4 5 2 that of the dark system fig s11b etsa increased with the addition of se cqds which reached to 85 2 in the presence of 0 42 ml g 1 vss se cqds 3 4 the potential radical quenching mechanism by se cqds as a fluorescence probe for semi quantitatively detecting oh terephthalic acid was added into simulative system to explore the potential radical quenching ability of se cqds under 50 000 lux illumination the composite signal of terephthalic acid oh adduct in 3 mm h2o2 solution increased greatly which indicated the production of oh fig 4 a in contrast only a small amount of oh was formed after the addition of se cqds fig 4b epr was further employed to detect the oh changes in both heterogeneous ultraviolent excites tio2 and homogenous photocatalytic ultraviolent activates h2o2 systems as shown in fig 4c a strong signal referring to dmpo oh adduct was observed in the above two systems after adding se cqds the signal disappeared in addition oh probe o26 was used to label oh in anammox bacterial cells and sludge was observed by fluorescence microscopy fig s12 results showed that an obvious green fluorescence generated after exposing sludge at light irradiation fig s12e indicating a high content of oh was formed in comparison the green fluorescent intensity was greatly reduced after dosing se cqds proving good its good quenching ability towards ros consequently se cqds have a superior scavenging effect on oh which mitigated the photo oxidative damage on sludge to explore whether light was involved in ros quenching fenton system was constructed under dark condition and terephthalic acid was used to probe the change of oh content in the system as shown in the fig 4d the fluorescence intensity of oh was significantly decreased with supply of se cqds into system herein se cqds reacted as a strong reducing agent to directly remove oh without the need for light activation 4 discussion ros are mostly produced by continuous single electron transfer reactions of oxygen molecules catalyzed by enzymes in the respiratory chain o2 can be converted spontaneously or enzymatically by superoxide dismutase sod to h2o2 borisov et al 2021 under external stimulation h2o2 produced by microorganisms can cross the cell membrane and combine with fe2 to generate the strong oxidant oh through fenton like reaction glaeser et al 2011 since bacteria also possess endogenous photosensitizers a high intensity light can produce a large amount of ros which inhibits their activity flavin cofactors are present in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase ii of the respiratory chain which also are able to react with molecular oxygen to produce h2o2 and o2 messner and imlay 1999 generally intracellular antioxidant enzyme system was essential to maintain redox homeostasis sod decomposes o2 into h2o2 or o2 h2o2 is further decomposed into h2o by cat and gsh px fig 5 however due to the high content of heme c of anammox bacteria the fenton like reaction mediated oh content was high which would in turn attack enzyme system fig 3c and possibly cause cell apoptosis or necrosis zhang et al 2014 herein an increased lipid peroxide product content was observed fig 3a more importantly ladderane lipid structure was damaged fig 2d and functional genes abundances were declined fig s8 leading to a decreased nitrogen removal activity se cqds were found to greatly mitigate the above oxidative damages for the extracellular interaction between se cqds and anammox cells first the surface attached se cqds were able to partially absorb ultraviolent light fig 2c and emit visible light since the photoinhibition was primarily originated from ultraviolent light the optical property of as prepared se cqds would partially attenuate potential photoinhibition on bacteria once se cqds penetrated into cells fig 1d it can effectively scavenge oh and mitigate the oxidative stress under the optimal dosage antioxidant enzymes activities recovered fig 3c and lipid peroxide level declined figs 2d and 3a which resulted in a sludge activity recovery recent studies also found that the selenium containing compounds exhibited antioxidant properties domínguez álvarez et al 2022 herein benefiting from the extracellular and intracellular interaction with microbial cells se cqds would maintain a redox homeostasis and mitigate cellular photoinhibition 5 conclusions the specific anammox activity decreased by 29 7 5 2 and reactive oxygen species ros content increased by 134 8 4 1 under 50 000 lux light oh and o2 were identified as the leading ros inducing lipid peroxidation and antioxidase function detriment also the structure of ladderane lipids located on anammoxosome was destroyed by ros and functional genes abundances declined accordingly sludge activity could be completely recovered under the optimum dosage of 0 42 ml g 1 vss se cqds the added se cqds was efficient to absorb ultraviolent light and scavenge oxidative ros which could greatly mitigate the photooxidative damage caused on anammox granule the findings of this work provide in depth understanding the metabolic response mechanism of anammox consortia to light irradiation and might be valuable for a more stable and sustainable nitrogen removal technology development appendix a declaration of competing

15606,this study was aimed to evaluate the effects of a pre treatment involving sulfite s iv synergistically activated by ultraviolet uv fe ii on natural organic matter nom enhanced ca2 scaling during nanofiltration treatment based on the variations in the physicochemical properties and correlation analyses of irreversible resistance the intrinsic fouling mechanisms were revealed from two aspects bulk crystallization interaction between nom and inorganic ions and surface crystallization morphology of surface crystallization and a change in the ca2 concentration in the scaling layer furthermore the degradation contribution rates of different free radicals during the uv fe ii s iv ufs treatment process were evaluated during the reactions in the ufs three free radicals so 4 oh and e aq were generated and in situ fe iii was formed in situ the carboxyl groups of the nom were attacked by the free radicals resulting in decreased of carboxyl concentration and density in addition the bond between ca2 and nom weakened and hydrophobic hpo substances were mineralized however the fe iii formed in situ was active and electropositive competing with ca2 for the complexation active sites on the nom the synergy effect of bulk crystallization and surface crystallization led to a significant decrease in the particle size of feed solution the crystal size and roughness of membrane surface also decreased which was conducive to reducing the membrane irreversible resistance correlation analysis revealed that the hpo ratio carboxyl density and particle size 100 nm ratio were effective characterization parameters for predicting irreversible resistance this study not only provides guidance for alleviating membrane fouling caused by nom enhanced ca2 scaling during the nanofiltration process but also presents the rationality of irreversible resistance during nanofiltration process and various indicators with strong linear correlation graphical abstract image graphical abstract

groups yu et al 2018a poses great threat to the safety of drinking water and is difficult to effectively remove using traditional water treatment processes kimura et al 2018 nanofiltration nf technology has great potential in nom separation owing to its superior purification capacity however previous studies have reported that their membrane pores were easily blocked when the nom molecular weight distribution was close to the molecular weight cut off of the membrane yang et al 2020 yu et al 2018a the inorganic crystallization of a feed solution may also aggravate membrane fouling lin et al 2021b furthermore humic acids has not only interact with metal ions such as calcium ions to generate crystal organic combined networks but also act as nuclei to enhance bulk crystallization thereby facilitating the formation of scaling and precipitation lin et al 2021a wang et al 2016 moreover sodium alginate sa reportedly has a rigid fibrous structure which can form an extensive three dimensional cross linked structure known as a gel with ca2 tang et al 2011 the ionic bridge between the two adjacent carboxyl groups of bovine serum albumin bsa has also been formed by reacting with ca2 from different peptide chains tang et al 2011 thereby forming a dense scaling layer at the membrane surface therefore the application of nf in nom removal is severely hindered by these problems lin et al 2014 yang et al 2018 this phenomenon is also found to be particularly common during the nf treatment process of surface water with seawater erosion and organic matter in the southeast coastal regions of china several studies have employed a pre treatment for nom water purification tian et al 2018 bai et al 2021 yang et al 2020 adsorption such as powder activated carbon pac may remove organic foulants or micropollutants from water however ding et al 2021 established that in the long term operation of an ultrafiltration and gravity membrane system a dense cake layer was formed thereby aggravating membrane fouling as a result of the pre deposition of pac at the membrane surface the combined fouling of adsorbents and nom resulted in both nom pre adsorption and nf in addition to adsorption several studies have revealed that oxidation is a possible method for improving the molecular weight distribution hydrophilic hpi and hydrophobic properties of nom bai et al 2021 yang et al 2020 hence advanced oxidation processes aops have been widely used to further improve the efficiency of oxidation treatment aops have high potential to alleviate membrane fouling caused by nom tian et al 2018 investigated the effects of ultraviolet uv activated persulfate on ultrafiltration membrane fouling caused by surface water with high dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations 5 5 7 5 mg l they found that at a concentration of 0 6 mm of persulfate after 120 min of uv irradiation ultrafiltration membrane fouling was greatly mitigated the formation of so 4 and hydroxyl radicals oh removed 58 of nom and fluorescent molecules were virtually totally destroyed meanwhile with the reduction of nom and development of hpi substances adhesion between nom and membrane was weakened furthermore at neutral ph nom was more likely to be hydroxylated and carboxylated than degraded by free radicals thereby increasing its nom hydrophilicity and mitigating membrane fouling yang et al 2020 the sulfate radical advanced oxidation process sr aop has recently been considered as a fenton like reaction with a high applicability it reportedly exhibits more stable properties larger effective ph range higher initial reaction rate and selective degradation of organic compounds than oh wacławek et al 2017 when s iv was activated by transition metals such as ferrous fe ii an alternating reaction combined with non radical and radical reactions occurred s iv was also identified as the inner layer coordination complexation of fe ii and s iv eq 1 chen et al 2019a 2019b meena et al 2017 zhou et al 2018 under natural reoxygenation the complexes formed by fe ii and s iv were rapidly oxidized to fe iii s iv complexes however the fe iii s iv complexes were very unstable and were therefore rapidly decomposed to fe ii and so 3 after the internal transfer of electrons from s iv to fe iii eqs 2 and 3 chen et al 2019b gao et al 2019 so 3 can rapidly combine with oxygen to form so 5 and then react with s iv to form so 4 eqs 4 and 5 in addition hso 3 reacts with so 5 to form so 3 and hso 5 further reacted with fe2 to form fe3 and so 4 eq 9 liu et al 2021 these are the two important pathways for generating so 4 from s iv the decomposition of fe ii iii s iv complexes plays an important role in the loop of metal valence state transformation and oxysulfur radical evolution and is thus a factor influencing the overall rate of sulfite oxidation during this decomposition process the energy input in the form of uv radiation specifically contributes to increasing the decomposition rate zhang et al 2013 in addition uv radiation excites so2 3 to produce so 3 and hydrates electrons e aq eq 7 which have degradation and mineralization effects on nom gu et al 2017 the main reactions in the hybrid uv fe ii s iv ufs system are presented in table 1 and the loops of fe valence transformation and oxysulfur radical evolution in the ufs are shown in fig 1 both the possibility of the synergistic activation of s iv by uv and fe ii and nf fouling mitigation caused by seawater erosion and nom should be explored therefore the aim of this study was to apply fe ii and uv to synergistically activate sulfite to obtain a cheap safe and moderate alternative to persulfate that improves the complex crystallization of organic matter and ca2 during nf treatment a comparison of uv activation alone with the combined activation of fe ii and uv fe ii was performed to explore the effect of the hybrid system on nom to further understand the fouling mitigation mechanisms in addition the removal effects of so 4 oh and e aq on sulfamethoxazole smx were investigated via quenching experiments to determine the contributions of different free radicals to the degradation rate by determining the effluent doc disinfection by product dbp concentrations and membrane flux the feasibility and safety of the hybrid system treatment were evaluated 2 materials and methods 2 1 feed water preparation nom typically composes of polysaccharides proteins and humic substances the quality of raw water quality in southeast coastal areas of china is easily influenced by precipitation and temperature which are difficult to control as a single experimental variable in this study model foulants with cacl2 and na2so4 were employed to simulate surface water eroded by seawater and nom the quality parameter of the studied raw water is presented in table s1 an ha solution was prepared as follows method briefly 1 g of ha h16752 sigma aldrich usa was dissolved in 900 ml of 0 1 mm naoh solution and the ph was adjusted to 7 0 0 2 by adding hcl the solution was then stirred for 24 h 1 g of sa and bsa sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china was weighted and stirred in a beaker for 24 h the volume was maintained at 1000 ml and the ph was adjusted to 7 0 0 2 to obtain a reserve solution in this study the concentrations of the ha sa and bsa in the solution were all 5 mg l tert butanol tba and methanol meoh were purchased from aladdin chemicals aladdin co china cacl2 10 mm and na2so4 10 mm solutions were added to simulate the ionic strength of surface water eroded by seawater the remaining solutions were made using deionized di water with analytic reagent obtained from china national medicines china all experimental groups and abbreviations are presented in table 2 2 2 experimental protocol a polyamide nf membrane effective area of 42 cm2 and molecular weight cut off of 300 da nf270 dow filmtec usa was utilized for the cross flow nf test the nf system comprised a metering pump type p bran luebbe germany a manometer and an electronic balance and cross flow membrane module cf042d sterlitch usa the operating pressure δp pa of the nf system was maintained at 0 8 mpa using the manometer cross flow filtration typically adopted in nf therefore the feed liquid flows parallel to the membrane surface driven by the pump cross flow rate refers to the parallel velocity which was 0 2 m s in this study a thermostatic bath dc 0510 scientz china was used to maintain the temperature at 25 1 during the filtration process the permeate was collected in the beaker and recorded on a computer each nf membrane was compacted in the system using di water for 2 h in advance and the experimental device is shown in fig 2 the uv fe ii sulfite pre treatment device is shown in fig s1 2 3 membrane fouling assessment total resistance rtot m 1 can be primarily divided into membrane inherent resistance rm and scaling layer resistance rs lin et al 2021b thus the nf membrane was placed in the membrane module and then filtered using di water to acquire the initial membrane flux j0 l m2h the rm was then calculated as shown in eq 10 the μ pa s is the dynamic viscosity coefficient of water at room temperature the raw water was filtrated and the average flux of the final 10 ml was denoted as j1 and was used to calculate rtot as shown in eq 11 to wipe off the scaling layer the surface of the nf membrane was gently wiped using a wet sponge when nf was completed the nf membrane was then installed onto the membrane module and filtrated using di water the stable flux was recorded as j2 thus rs was further divided into reversible resistance rr and irreversible resistance rir as shown in eq 12 and eq 13 respectively in addition the specific flux was defined as the ratio of j1 to j0 the calculation methods of pearson s correlation analysis are described in si 10 r m δ p μ j 0 11 r tot δ p μ j 1 12 r ir δ p μ j 2 δ p μ j 0 13 r r δ p μ j 1 δ p μ j 2 2 4 characterization of the membrane scaling layer previous studies have revealed that the ca2 scaling is enhanced by nom at the membrane surface during filtration bai et al 2021 yang et al 2020 the scaling layer was gently peeled into 1 l of di water subsequently 0 1 mm hcl was added using ultrasonic shocking heated and stirred to first dissolve the scaling layer the ca2 concentration was determined using an atomic absorption spectrometer and via the flame atomic method the ca2 concentration at the membrane surface was determined via atomic fluorescence absorption aa 7000 shimadzu japan a scanning electron microscope sem gemini sem 300 zeiss germany was used to analyze the morphology of the scaling layer at the membrane surface the surface roughness was determined via atomic

to evaluate the effect of oxidation on the concentration of carboxyl groups and crystallization of the feed solution 3 results and discussion 3 1 variations in the specific flux and scaling layer resistance during filtration the curves of specific flux during nf are shown in fig 3 for the nom enhanced ca2 scaling the specific flux was remarkably decreased to 0 39 without pre treatment the specific flux increased to 0 52 with the application of fs1 whereas there was no significant flux improvement under us1 evidently the e aq generated by sulfite photodecomposition was rapidly oxidized by the residual dissolved oxygen in the feed solution resulting in an ineffective mineralized degradation of nom gu et al 2016 li et al 2014 the specific flux was significantly increased at ufs1 compared under us1 and fs1 suggesting that the synergistic effect between fe ii and uv activation was superior as was hypothesised meanwhile the trend of the specific flux greatly varied under ufs the specific flux was increased during the initial filtration stage this phenomenon was consistent with previous studies which demonstrated that a delayed period was required before flux decline during nf of brackish water this can be attributed to the time required to generate sufficient crystal nuclei in the feed solution lin et al 2021a 2021b this difference also indicated that the ufs hybrid system could effectively delay crystal nucleus formation thereby mitigating membrane fouling membrane fouling was effectively alleviated by increasing oxidant dosage fig 3a and b the final specific flux under ufs2 for example was increased to 0 95 lin et al 2021b studied the effect of ha enhanced gypsum scaling pre oxidation using naclo they found that naclo resulted in continuous aggravation of short term membrane fouling while long term membrane fouling was only slightly alleviated they also found that naclo accelerated the formation of crystal nuclei and damaged the integrity of scaling layer to form a porous structure the average particle size of feed solution crystals also decreased with an increasing dosage of oxidants lin et al 2021a the effectiveness of the hybrid system in alleviating nom enhanced ca2 scaling on membrane fouling was further established via this discrepancy to better assess the advantages of ufs during membrane fouling mitigation additional experiments were performed using natural water from a peninsula in the southeast china in this study the natural water was contaminated by seawater and nom fig s2 similarly the specific flux of ufs2 decreased from 0 92 to 0 81 ufs still exhibited the excellent effects of membrane fouling mitigation effects fig 4 a shows the membrane resistance under different pre treatment conditions based on the resistance calculation formula the rtot of feed solution was 2 6 1014 m 1 the rs was further divided into rr and rir using the cleaning method described in section 2 3 the rir was 0 48 1014 m 1 and the rr was 2 12 1014 m 1 under ufs2 the rr and rir were reduced to 0 21 1013 m 1 and 2 08 1013 m 1 respectively indicating that the hybrid system had an excellent effect on membrane fouling mitigation to further verify the rationality division of rs the flux of the cleaned membrane was measured through the feed solution fig 4b compared with cycle 1 both the initial and final fluxes of the membrane significantly decreased during cycles 2 and 3 the initial flux of cycle 2 was 0 43 that is 0 85 times that of cycle 1 which was close to the ratio of rir to rtot in cycle 1 this phenomenon verified the rationality of irreversible rir previous study has reported that the size of nf membrane pores may increase under high ionic strength al amoudi and lovitt 2007 increased pore sizes reportedly lead to the enhancement of nom adsorption and increase in inorganic ions in addition the hpo fraction of nom and ca2 gets adsorbed at the membrane surface and can be hardly removed via simple physical cleaning roudman and digiano 2000 meanwhile the final flux under ufs2 in the second cycle decreased by 5 18 compared with that in cycle 1 and this value was decreased by 1 85 in cycle 5 this indicated that rir did not increase linearly with the filtration time when the filtration period was extended to 1000 min the final specific flux under ufs2 decreased to 0 81 which was only 0 1 less than that at 200 min the membrane fouling mitigation performance for multi cycle applications was also remarkable furthermore to evaluate the influence of iron ions and sulfate ions on the characteristics of the effluent water the effluent water characteristics of the control and ufs2 groups were measured as presented in table s7 the zeta potential ca2 concentration and doc of the nf effluent decreased under the ufs2 pre treatment combined with the study results by bai et al 2021 it was concluded that the ufs2 process did not aggravate the effluent characteristics after nf 3 2 physicochemical properties of feedwater the two major functional groups of nom were the carboxyl and phenolic groups moreover the density of the phenolic groups was remarkably less than that of the carboxyl groups adusei gyamfi et al 2019 furthermore unlike the phenolic group the carboxyl group dissociated at ph values less than 8 0 because the carboxyl group is relatively more acidic ritchie and perdue 2003 owing to the dissociation of carboxyl group a double electric layer with a large potential surrounded the nom surface which was the most important reason for the negative charge of the nom previous studies have revealed that zeta potential could accurately reflect the charge characteristics of nom owing to the dissociation of carboxyl groups at a ph of 7 0 5 thereby efficiently evaluating the abundance of carboxyl groups bai et al 2021 collins et al 1986 lin et al 2021b yin et al 2020 the maximum zeta potential was 15 2 mv and the doc concentration was 3 71 mg l fig 5 a with an increased dosage of oxidants the zeta potential significantly decreased this might be because the carboxyl concentration in the feed solution decreased owing to the degradation of nom which was also established by the decrease in the doc this phenomenon was inconsistent with previous studies lin et al 2021b xue et al 2016 it was more likely that so 4 had a longer half life 30 40 μs and higher oxidation potential 2 5 3 1 v than oh 20 ns 1 8 2 7 v hence so 4 could effectively react with organic compounds and could improve the mass transfer efficiency thereby destroying the carboxyl structure wang et al 2021 the zeta potential of fs1 was 7 2 mv which was considerably higher than that under the ufs1 group uv light applied as an energy source accelerated the decomposition of the fe and s iv complex thereby improving the reaction efficiency and producing more sulfate radicals in situ compared with those under the us pre treatment the zeta potentials under the fs and ufs pre treatment significantly decreased the flocculation effect of in situ generation of fe iii shielded the negative charge of the nom to evaluate the density of carboxyl groups in the nom the ratio of the zeta potential to the doc could be considered as the approximate concentration of carboxyl groups in the nom the zeta doc significantly decreased with increasing dosage of oxidants table s5 in general decrease in the density and concentration of carboxyl groups may lead to a change in the interaction between carboxyl groups and inorganic ions thereby affecting the mechanisms of membrane fouling several studies have revealed that hpo substances can cause intense membrane fouling al amoudi 2010 tang et al 2011 xu et al 2006 to better understand the variations in nom properties following different pre treatment in the feed solution the hpi and hpo proportions were measured fig 5b eerrors may arise owing to the dilution of doc the control group had more hydrophobic substances than the ufs2 group moreover the hpo substances had a greater impact on membrane fouling therefore uv254 which was more sensitive to hydrophobic substances was used in this study to characterize the fluctuations in the hpo fraction the hpo fraction accounted for 63 7 without pre treatment the hpo ratio gradually decreased and the hpi increased with an increase in the oxidant dosage the mineralization and degradation of hpo were accelerated by the in situ formation of free radicals when fe ii participated in activation the proportion of hpo substances was low this might be because some hpo substances were removed by the flocculation of the fe iii formed in situ compared with those under fs2 and us2 hpo substances were removed more effectively under ufs2 confirming the hypothesis in section 3 1 that uv and fe ii synergistically activated s iv the correlations between different membrane fouling resistances rr and rir and physicochemical properties of the feed solution were systematically estimated the fitting formula and determination coefficients are shown in fig s3 the hpo fraction exhibited a higher linear correlation with rir fig s3b r2 0 9030 than with rr fig s3d r2 0 7324 the hpo substances can be adsorbed and deposited at the membrane surface tang et al 2011 hence thick and smooth scaling layers may have formed when hpo absorbed at the membrane surface a cake enhanced osmotic pressure ceop phenomenon occurred after the formation of this scaling layer which severely hindered the reverse diffusion of solute from the membrane surface to the feed solution the ceop phenomenon also led to the diffusion of solutes in the scaling layer thereby aggravating concentration polarization chong et al 2008 hoek and elimelech 2003 which considerably reduced the electrostatic particle membrane and particle particle interactions the forces which controlled the secondary and tertiary structures of nom were found to change at an extremely high ionic strength at the membrane surface bacchin et al 2002 moreover a slow recombination of nom occurred such that the nom was reorganized into a rigid dense spherical macromolecule at the membrane surface resulted in the increase of rir al amoudi 2010 the hpo fraction also significantly increased linearly with an increase in the zeta potential and zeta doc absolute value r2 0 9607 0 9402 fig s3f and h these results indicated that the total carboxyl group concentration and the carboxyl group density in the nom were positively correlated with the hpo fraction the concentration and density of carboxyl groups in the feed solution were important factors influencing the irreversible resistance this was because ca2 was more likely to form complex with nom which had higher carboxyl group density similarly the relationships of the hpi fraction with resistance zeta potential and zeta doc were the opposite to those of the hpo fraction however the correlation was relatively poor the results showed that the hpo fraction could better predict the changes in rir than the hpi fraction 3 3 variations in the functional group ftir spectra was used to characterize the variations in the nom functional groups fig 6 wavelengths in the range of 1400 1500 cm 1 were considered as amide structures of proteins which were related to the spatial structure α helix of proteins the wavelengths of carboxyl groups were in the range of 1600 1700 cm 1 and the wavelength range of 1000 1200 cm 1 represented ether bonds c o c ho et al 2018 yang et al 2020 after pre treatment the peak intensity of the carboxyl groups weakened indicating that some of the carboxyl groups had been oxidized this was also consistent with the estimation results of the zeta potential moreover the peak in the amide groups weakened indicating effective destruction of proteins chou et al 2016 li et al 2019 the intensity of the carboxyl group peak decreased whereas that of the c o c increased with an increase in the oxidant dosage the carboxyl group can convert to c o c through epoxidation or oxygenation reaction under ufs thus the concentration of free carboxyl group was decreased to avoid forming complex with ca2 al jorani et al 2018 cusso et al 2016 mester et al 2020 yu et al 2018b moreover compared with those under us1 and fs1 the intensity of carboxyl and amide structure peaks remarkably decreased under ufs1 this indicated that the effect on nom removal was superior owing to the synergistic activation of uv and fe ii in addition the synergistic effect seemed to be increased and more efficient at lower concentrations fig 6a and b 3 4 dbps dbps may generate during the treatment process thereby posing threat to human health therefore three typical regulated dbps and bromine dbps br dbps were determined in this study trihalomethane thm was represented by chloroform tcm haloacetic acid haa was represented by dichloroacetic acid dcaa and dichloroacetonirile dcan was represented by haloacetonitrile han zhou et al 2015 br dbps and the control effects of the three kinds of thm control effect are shown in fig s4 the total concentration of dbps with fs was higher than that with us fig 7 this was more likely because the e aq was the major free radical during uv activation which had better control effect on the generation of dbps than oh the concentrations of the regulated dbps tcm dcaa and dcan under ufs2 were decreased to 3 65 6 03 and 3 93 μg l respectively similarly br dbps also exhibited an excellent control effect fig s4 wang et al 2018 established that dbp degradation was a first order reaction at a certain ps concentration 0 0 5 mm this was highly consistent with the decreasing trend of the dbp concentrations in this study when the oxidant dosage increased in addition the positive effects of so 4 on dbp removal were superior than those of oh this was because the reactivity of nom with oh koh nom 2 5 104 l mg 1 s 1 was higher than that with so 4 kso 4 nom 2 103 l mg 1 s 1 hou et al 2018 the steady state concentration of oh under ufs was 2 5 10 13 m whereas it was 2 5 10 12 m under uv h2o2 hua et al 2019 high concentrations of oh and reactivity with nom resulted in increased contents of dbp precursors for example the formation of acetaldehyde after uv h2o2 was 128 higher than that of uv persulfate at the same oxidant dosage inducing a higher yields of dbps xie et al 2015 3 5 bulk crystallization the changes in the carboxyl group concentration in the feed solution affected the complexation with ca2 which might exert a great influence on the particle size distribution and scaling layer at the membrane surface therefore the distribution of nanometre scale particles of bulk crystals in the feed solution was monitored fig 8 during the filtration process bulk crystallizations and different sizes were developed in feed solution without treatment the average particle size of feed solution decreased with oxidant addition exerting an inhibiting effect on bulk crystallizations with an increase in the oxidant dosage the average particle size distribution further decreased to 4 85 nm under ufs2 the mechanisms of the hybrid system on nom enhanced bulk crystallization were further revealed during the activation of fe ii more reactive and electropositive fe iii were formed in situ therefore the carboxyl groups were more likely to preferentially bind with fe iii thereby weakening the bridging effect of ca2 on nom as well as bulk crystallization mi and elimelech 2008 therefore the average particle size of the feed solution was significantly decreased under the ufs treatment in addition correlation analysis results showed that both rr and rir were positively correlated with the particle size 100 nm fraction correspondingly the linear relationship between average particle size and resistance was weaker than that between resistance and particle size 100 nm fraction indicating that the particle size 100 nm fraction could better predict the variations in the membrane resistances the linear r2 and pearson r regression analysis as well as the significance analysis p of zeta or zeta doc with particle size distribution were performed table s6 the p value of either zeta or zeta doc with particle size distribution passed the α 0 005 detection threshold therefore both zeta and zeta doc had significant impacts on the particle size distribution this hypothesis was also confirmed by the calculation results of r2 and r bulk crystallization had a higher correlation with rir r2 0 9017 than with rr r2 0 8826 which was helpful for understanding the mitigation mechanisms 3 6 surface crystallization the foulant concentration and scaling layer morphology affected the membrane flux and resistance consequently the morphologies of the scaling layer were further scanned via sem fig 9 at a proportional scale the inorganic scaling in the control group was significantly large and the cake layer was dense nf membrane surfaces were typically negatively charged owing to the dissociation of functional groups carboxyl and amino groups it is known that nom is also negatively charged which results in electrostatic repulsion between the membrane surface and nom meanwhile the debye length was inversely proportional to the square of ionic strength thus debye length decreased at high ionic concentrations implying that the double electric layer was thinner under electrostatic repulsion the compression of the double electric layer results in a decrease in the energy barrier which was conducive to the aggregation and settlement of nom at the membrane surface tang et al 2011 in addition the scaling layer was considerably stacked thereby aggravating membrane fouling the crystallization in fig 9a was partly rough and partly smooth the rough crystallization was more likely generated by nom and ca2 complexation whereas the smooth scaling layer tended to be inorganic crystallization the size of inorganic structure at the membrane surface remarkably decreased and porous structures appeared with oxidant addition this porous structure appeared more readily when fe ii was involved in the activation process fig 9b d it was reasonable to conclude that the formation of porous structure was related to the flocculation of fe iii formed in situ during the reaction process moreover this porous structure could mitigate membrane fouling and effectively improve the membrane flux it is well known that the roughness of membrane surface influences the interaction energy and membrane fouling hence monitoring the variations in the membrane surface roughness was necessary fig 10 shows the afm diagrams of the membrane surface under different pre treatment conditions for the control group the average deviation ra and root mean square rms were 71 75 nm and 89 65 nm respectively which indicated surface roughness gao et al 2021 this was likely attributed to the fact that nom was adsorbed on the membrane surface and enhanced the bulk crystallization of ca2 however crystallization accumulated at the membrane surface evidenced through sem these two reasons led to the increase in the membrane surface roughness the electrostatic repulsion between foulants and the membrane decreased owing to the increase in roughness bowen and doneva 2000 moreover foulants were preferentially deposited in the valley region of the rough structures because of the relatively strong adhesion force at this area the surface shear rate and acid base polar interaction in the valley region were weakened resulting in severe membrane fouling however the ra and rms decreased to 43 18 nm and 55 46 nm under ufs2 respectively indicating that the surface roughness was significantly reduced under hybrid system the ca2 concentration in the scaling layer was measured to characterize the variations in crystallization at the membrane surface after oxidation the ca2 concentration on the membrane surface reached 35 854 mg m2 without pre treatment indicating that the surface crystallization primarily comprised of ca2 fig 11 furthermore carboxyl groups and polysaccharides significantly enhanced ca2 crystallization this number decreased to 25 551 mg m2 under ufs1 and declined steadily to 11 532 mg m2 with the addition of oxidants the variations in the ca2 concentration at membrane surface were further analyzed from the perspective of intermolecular forces and nf membrane rejection mechanism during oxidation the carboxyl group was attacked by free radicals the ca2 concentration in the scaling layer was declined with a decrease in the carboxyl concentration moreover more reactive and electropositive fe iii was generated in situ during the activation of sulfite by fe ii then the fe iii formed in situ were preferentially bound to nom when competing with ca2 for nom adsorption sites therefore the complexation of ca2 to nom was further weakened this also explained why the ca2 concentration under us2 was considerably higher than those under fs2 and ufs2 combining fe iii and the membrane functional groups was more likely to cause a decrease in the charge density at the membrane surface or even render the charge reversal in this case the interception mechanism was affected by the donnan and dielectric effects the electrostatic attraction of membrane was also changed to electrostatic repulsion of ca2 which further decreased ca2 concentration the linear fitting of ca2 and membrane resistance also established that ca2 concentration in the scaling layer was an important factor influencing rir 3 7 mechanism of oxidation influenced membrane fouling behaviors to further explore the treatment mechanism of ufs in terms of the interfacial interaction energies the curves of interface interaction energy between foulants and membrane were drawn fig 12 and the surface free energy is listed in table s4 the glw lw gab ab and gel el represented the van der waals interaction polar interaction force and electrostatic interaction interface free energy respectively the sum of the three constitutes the total interface free energy yang et al 2021 the g131 represented cohesive free energy whereas g132 represented adhesive free energy the total interaction energy had a maximum value called the energy barrier which was expressed as the energy that has to be overcome for binding to the membrane surface zhang et al 2022 without pre treatment the energy barrier was only 241 47 mj m2 this was consistent with the conclusion that a small energy barrier was formed owing to the compression of double electric layer under high ionic strength the ab and el interactions were repulsive forces between foulants and membrane occurring over the entire separation distance whereas the lw interaction acted as an attraction the strength of the interaction between two planar surfaces could be quantified by the specific energy of contact at the energy barrier the specific energies of lw ab and el exhibited no remarkable differences however the ab interaction was changed with oxidant addition the effective distance of the ab interaction between the foulants and membrane was considerably longer than those of el and lw interactions in addition the specific contact energy of the ab interaction accounted for 69 of the total contact energy under ufs2 indicating that ab interaction played a key role in binding the foulants to the membranes this conclusion was also consistent with results in surface free energy value in table s4 and previous studies zhang et al 2020 zhao et al 2016 the correlation between the energy barrier and membrane resistance under different treatment conditions is shown in fig 12h and i both reversible and irreversible resistance decreased with increasing of energy barrier indicating that there was a strong negative linear correlation between energy barrier and membrane resistance this showed that with addition of oxidant and increase in dosage the energy required by foulant to overcome for binding to the membrane surface increased hence membrane fouling was effectively alleviated in addition to the linear correlation analysis pearson correlation analysis was used in this study to further determine indicators related to membrane resistance as shown in fig 13 as well as significance detection p in si all the absolute values of the correlation coefficients between irreversible resistance and each parameter were higher than 0 9 the ratio of the zeta potential r 0 98 zeta doc r 0 95 hpi ratio r 0 91 particle size 100 nm ratio r 0 97 and energy barrier r 0 94 showed excellent negative correlation indicating that decrease in the value of above indicators were beneficial for reducing the rir correspondingly hpo ratio r 0 95 particle size 100 nm ratio r 0 97 and ca2 concentration at the membrane surface r 0 92 were highly positively correlated with rir the proportion of zeta potential hpo ratio and particle size 100 nm ratio had a strong correlation with rir r 0 95 it was more appropriate to predict the variations in the irreversible resistance by measuring the above indicators similarly the p values between membrane resistance and each parameter were all less than 0 01 indicating that the detection parameters had a substantial influence on the changes in rr and rir with the exception of hpo and rr p 0 014 to comprehensively analyze the contribution rate of different free radicals to the mineralization degradation of nom during the oxidation process this study used electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy as well as explored the smx removal rate of ufs2 under different quenchers compared with the control group ufs2 group exhibited remarkable peak fluctuations indicating the generation of hydroxyl and sulfate radicals fig s6 ufs meoh represented methanol as a quencher whereas ufs tba represented tertiary butanol as a quencher fig s5 previous studies reported that methanol had a good quenching effect on so 4 and oh therefore smx was primarily degraded by e aq under ufs meoh thus e aq obtained a degradation efficiency of 25 1 moreover tert butanol had an excellent quenching effect on oh but had little effect on so 4 it was found that smx was primarily degraded by e aq and so 4 under ufs tba bai et al 2021 qiu et al 2019 based on the differences in the smx degradation rate between ufs meoh and ufs tba the degradation efficiency of so 4 was calculated as 54 8 whereas that of oh was 22 1 it was established that so 4 played a major role in nom degradation in the ufs system notably that the degradation rate of smx after tert butanol quenching reached 79 9 which was 10 5 higher than that under ufs therefore the formation of oh followed the consumption of so 4 consequently the consumption of so 4 was reduced owing to the quenching of oh by tert butanol thereby increasing the degradation rate of smx based on the above analysis the mitigation mechanism of ufs on nom enhanced ca2 scaling during nf was briefly described fig 14 with the use of ufs hybrid systems there were at least four different effects on nom including the mineralization of nom decrease in the carboxyl density change in scale layer structure and competitive complexation between fe iii and ca2 under the synergistic action of the above four effects membrane fouling was greatly alleviated 3 8 economic implications the above study primarily evaluated the ufs process from the aspect of the membrane fouling mitigation effect considering practical applications this study compared the economic differences between the control and ufs2 the computation details of power consumption and cost are presented in table s8 owing to regional disparities in chemicals and electricity costs this study uniformly considered the current scenario in the author s region without pre treatment the power consumption of nf treatment was 5850 kwh per ton and the power consumption per ton was reduced to 1600 kwh under ufs2 furthermore the total cost per ton water was approximately reduced by 74 this proportion may be even higher considering the decay of membrane life without treatment certainly the actual operational cost should be determined for wider practical applications however the ufs process could evidently reduce operational costs and has potential to practical applications 4 conclusion surface water polluted by seawater erosion and organic matter was simulated in this study the purpose of this study was to explore the fouling mitigation effect of nom enhanced ca2 scaling during nanofiltration the mechanisms of the uv fe ii s iv hybrid system in mitigating membrane fouling were also further explored filtration experiments revealed that uv and fe ii had remarkable synergistic effects on the activation of s iv resulting in effective membrane fouling mitigation in addition the rationality of the irreversible resistance division of nom enhanced ca2 scaling during nf was verified the linearly positive correlations between rir and the proportion of hydrophobic substances carboxyl density and particle size were established using correlation analysis during ufs treatment the concentration and density of carboxyl on nom significantly decreased owing to the attack of three free radicals so 4 oh and e aq fe iii formed in situ during the activation process competed with ca2 for the complex active sites in the nom more reactive and electropositive fe iii formed in situ preferentially bound to carboxyl groups severely limiting ca2 crystallization this also resulted in particle size decrease effectively reducing the bulk crystallization size furthermore hpo substances could cause severe membrane fouling than hpi substances with the use of ufs hpo substances were effectively degraded and mineralized thereby weakening the adsorption at the membrane surface and further reducing the development of irreversible resistance finally the quenching experiment revealed that so 4 was the major active radical in nom fouling mitigation and the inhibition of oh generation was more likely to further improve the treatment efficiency declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

15606,this study was aimed to evaluate the effects of a pre treatment involving sulfite s iv synergistically activated by ultraviolet uv fe ii on natural organic matter nom enhanced ca2 scaling during nanofiltration treatment based on the variations in the physicochemical properties and correlation analyses of irreversible resistance the intrinsic fouling mechanisms were revealed from two aspects bulk crystallization interaction between nom and inorganic ions and surface crystallization morphology of surface crystallization and a change in the ca2 concentration in the scaling layer furthermore the degradation contribution rates of different free radicals during the uv fe ii s iv ufs treatment process were evaluated during the reactions in the ufs three free radicals so 4 oh and e aq were generated and in situ fe iii was formed in situ the carboxyl groups of the nom were attacked by the free radicals resulting in decreased of carboxyl concentration and density in addition the bond between ca2 and nom weakened and hydrophobic hpo substances were mineralized however the fe iii formed in situ was active and electropositive competing with ca2 for the complexation active sites on the nom the synergy effect of bulk crystallization and surface crystallization led to a significant decrease in the particle size of feed solution the crystal size and roughness of membrane surface also decreased which was conducive to reducing the membrane irreversible resistance correlation analysis revealed that the hpo ratio carboxyl density and particle size 100 nm ratio were effective characterization parameters for predicting irreversible resistance this study not only provides guidance for alleviating membrane fouling caused by nom enhanced ca2 scaling during the nanofiltration

groups yu et al 2018a poses great threat to the safety of drinking water and is difficult to effectively remove using traditional water treatment processes kimura et al 2018 nanofiltration nf technology has great potential in nom separation owing to its superior purification capacity however previous studies have reported that their membrane pores were easily blocked when the nom molecular weight distribution was close to the molecular weight cut off of the membrane yang et al 2020 yu et al 2018a the inorganic crystallization of a feed solution may also aggravate membrane fouling lin et al 2021b furthermore humic acids has not only interact with metal ions such as calcium ions to generate crystal organic combined networks but also act as nuclei to enhance bulk crystallization thereby facilitating the formation of scaling and precipitation lin et al 2021a wang et al 2016 moreover sodium alginate sa reportedly has a rigid fibrous structure which can form an extensive three dimensional cross linked structure known as a gel with ca2 tang et al 2011 the ionic bridge between the two adjacent carboxyl groups of bovine serum albumin bsa has also been formed by reacting with ca2 from different peptide chains tang et al 2011 thereby forming a dense scaling layer at the membrane surface therefore the application of nf in nom removal is severely hindered by these problems lin et al 2014 yang et al 2018 this phenomenon is also found to be particularly common during the nf treatment process of surface water with seawater erosion and organic matter in the southeast coastal regions of china several studies have employed a pre treatment for nom water purification tian et al 2018 bai et al 2021 yang et al 2020 adsorption such as powder activated carbon pac may remove organic foulants or micropollutants from water however ding et al 2021 established that in the long term operation of an ultrafiltration and gravity membrane system a dense cake layer was formed thereby aggravating membrane fouling as a result of the pre deposition of pac at the membrane surface the combined fouling of adsorbents and nom resulted in both nom pre adsorption and nf in addition to adsorption several studies have revealed that oxidation is a possible method for improving the molecular weight distribution hydrophilic hpi and hydrophobic properties of nom bai et al 2021 yang et al 2020 hence advanced oxidation processes aops have been widely used to further improve the efficiency of oxidation treatment aops have high potential to alleviate membrane fouling caused by nom tian et al 2018 investigated the effects of ultraviolet uv activated persulfate on ultrafiltration membrane fouling caused by surface water with high dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations 5 5 7 5 mg l they found that at a concentration of 0 6 mm of persulfate after 120 min of uv irradiation ultrafiltration membrane fouling was greatly mitigated the formation of so 4 and hydroxyl radicals oh removed 58 of nom and fluorescent molecules were virtually totally destroyed meanwhile with the reduction of nom and development of hpi substances adhesion between nom and membrane was weakened furthermore at neutral ph nom was more likely to be hydroxylated and carboxylated than degraded by free radicals thereby increasing its nom hydrophilicity and mitigating membrane fouling yang et al 2020 the sulfate radical advanced oxidation process sr aop has recently been considered as a fenton like reaction with a high applicability it reportedly exhibits more stable properties larger effective ph range higher initial reaction rate and selective degradation of organic compounds than oh wacławek et al 2017 when s iv was activated by transition metals such as ferrous fe ii an alternating reaction combined with non radical and radical reactions occurred s iv was also identified as the inner layer coordination complexation of fe ii and s iv eq 1 chen et al 2019a 2019b meena et al 2017 zhou et al 2018 under natural reoxygenation the complexes formed by fe ii and s iv were rapidly oxidized to fe iii s iv complexes however the fe iii s iv complexes were very unstable and were therefore rapidly decomposed to fe ii and so 3 after the internal transfer of electrons from s iv to fe iii eqs 2 and 3 chen et al 2019b gao et al 2019 so 3 can rapidly combine with oxygen to form so 5 and then react with s iv to form so 4 eqs 4 and 5 in addition hso 3 reacts with so 5 to form so 3 and hso 5 further reacted with fe2 to form fe3 and so 4 eq 9 liu et al 2021 these are the two important pathways for generating so 4 from s iv the decomposition of fe ii iii s iv complexes plays an important role in the loop of metal valence state transformation and oxysulfur radical evolution and is thus a factor influencing the overall rate of sulfite oxidation during this decomposition process the energy input in the form of uv radiation specifically contributes to increasing the decomposition rate zhang et al 2013 in addition uv radiation excites so2 3 to produce so 3 and hydrates electrons e aq eq 7 which have degradation and mineralization effects on nom gu et al 2017 the main reactions in the hybrid uv fe ii s iv ufs system are presented in table 1 and the loops of fe valence transformation and oxysulfur radical evolution in the ufs are shown in fig 1 both the possibility of the synergistic activation of s iv by uv and fe ii and nf fouling mitigation caused by seawater erosion and nom should be explored therefore the aim of this study was to apply fe ii and uv to synergistically activate sulfite to obtain a cheap safe and moderate alternative to persulfate that improves the complex crystallization of organic matter and ca2 during nf treatment a comparison of uv activation alone with the combined activation of fe ii and uv fe ii was performed to explore the effect of the hybrid system on nom to further understand the fouling mitigation mechanisms in addition the removal effects of so 4 oh and e aq on sulfamethoxazole smx were investigated via quenching experiments to determine the contributions of different free radicals to the degradation rate by determining the effluent doc disinfection by product dbp concentrations and membrane flux the feasibility and safety of the hybrid system treatment were evaluated 2 materials and methods 2 1 feed water preparation nom typically composes of polysaccharides proteins and humic substances the quality of raw water quality in southeast coastal areas of china is easily influenced by precipitation and temperature which are difficult to control as a single experimental variable in this study model foulants with cacl2 and na2so4 were employed to simulate surface water eroded by seawater and nom the quality parameter of the studied raw water is presented in table s1 an ha solution was prepared as follows method briefly 1 g of ha h16752 sigma aldrich usa was dissolved in 900 ml of 0 1 mm naoh solution and the ph was adjusted to 7 0 0 2 by adding hcl the solution was then stirred for 24 h 1 g of sa and bsa sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china was weighted and stirred in a beaker for 24 h the volume was maintained at 1000 ml and the ph was adjusted to 7 0 0 2 to obtain a reserve solution in this study the concentrations of the ha sa and bsa in the solution were all 5 mg l tert butanol tba and methanol meoh were purchased from aladdin chemicals aladdin co china cacl2 10 mm and na2so4 10 mm solutions were added to simulate the ionic strength of surface water eroded by seawater the remaining solutions were made using deionized di water with analytic reagent obtained from china national medicines china all experimental groups and abbreviations are presented in table 2 2 2 experimental protocol a polyamide nf membrane effective area of 42 cm2 and molecular weight cut off of 300 da nf270 dow filmtec usa was utilized for the cross flow nf test the nf system comprised a metering pump type p bran luebbe germany a manometer and an electronic balance and cross flow membrane module cf042d sterlitch usa the operating pressure δp pa of the nf system was maintained at 0 8 mpa using the manometer cross flow filtration typically adopted in nf therefore the feed liquid flows parallel to the membrane surface driven by the pump cross flow rate refers to the parallel velocity which was 0 2 m s in this study a thermostatic bath dc 0510 scientz china was used to maintain the temperature at 25 1 during the filtration process the permeate was collected in the beaker and recorded on a computer each nf membrane was compacted in the system using di water for 2 h in advance and the experimental device is shown in fig 2 the uv fe ii sulfite pre treatment device is shown in fig s1 2 3 membrane fouling assessment total resistance rtot m 1 can be primarily divided into membrane inherent resistance rm and scaling layer resistance rs lin et al 2021b thus the nf membrane was placed in the membrane module and then filtered using di water to acquire the initial membrane flux j0 l m2h the rm was then calculated as shown in eq 10 the μ pa s is the dynamic viscosity coefficient of water at room temperature the raw water was filtrated and the average flux of the final 10 ml was denoted as j1 and was used to calculate rtot as shown in eq 11 to wipe off the scaling layer the surface of the nf membrane was gently wiped using a wet sponge when nf was completed the nf membrane was then installed onto the membrane module and filtrated using di water the stable flux was recorded as j2 thus rs was further divided into reversible resistance rr and irreversible resistance rir as shown in eq 12 and eq 13 respectively in addition the specific flux was defined as the ratio of j1 to j0 the calculation methods of pearson s correlation analysis are described in si 10 r m δ p μ j 0 11 r tot δ p μ j 1 12 r ir δ p μ j 2 δ p μ j 0 13 r r δ p μ j 1 δ p μ j 2 2 4 characterization of the membrane scaling layer previous studies have revealed that the ca2 scaling is enhanced by nom at the membrane surface during filtration bai et al 2021 yang et al 2020 the scaling layer was gently peeled into 1 l of di water subsequently 0 1 mm hcl was added using ultrasonic shocking heated and stirred to first dissolve the scaling layer the ca2 concentration was determined using an atomic absorption spectrometer and via the flame atomic method the ca2 concentration at the membrane surface was determined via atomic fluorescence absorption aa 7000 shimadzu japan a scanning electron microscope sem gemini sem 300 zeiss germany was used to analyze the morphology of the scaling layer at the membrane surface the surface roughness was determined via atomic force microscopy afm bioscopesystem bruker usa the hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity were analyzed using the contact angle analyzer jysp 360 beijing china of fouled membrane the cohesive and adhesive free energies of membrane were then calculated using the contact angle data based on the xdlvo theory and interface free energy is introduced in si zhang et al 2022 2020 zhao et al 2016 2 5 physicochemical properties of feed solution the uv absorbance uv254 was determined using an ultraviolet absorbance spectrophotometer t6 puxi china and the concentration of dissolved organic carbon doc was detected using a total organic carbon analyzer toc multi n c 2100s jena germany the samples filtered using a 0 45 μm microfilter were separated using styrene diethylene xad 4 and methyl methacrylate copolymer xad 8 resins to analyze the changes in the hpi hpo and transitional tpi fractions in the samples using uv254 the functional groups of the organic compounds were analyzed using a fourier transform infrared spectrometer ftir nicolet 8700 thermal usa the dbps were identified using a gas chromatography mass spectrometer gc ms agilent 209 6890 usa to ensure the drinking safety after treatment smx was measured via high performance liquid mass spectrometry e2695 waters usa both particle size distribution and zeta potential were determined using zetasizer nano zs 90 malvern uk to evaluate the effect of oxidation on the concentration of carboxyl groups and crystallization of the feed solution 3 results and discussion 3 1 variations in the specific flux and scaling layer resistance during filtration the curves of specific flux during nf are shown in fig 3 for the nom enhanced ca2 scaling the specific flux was remarkably decreased to 0 39 without pre treatment the specific flux increased to 0 52 with the application of fs1 whereas there was no significant flux improvement under us1 evidently the e aq generated by sulfite photodecomposition was rapidly oxidized by the residual dissolved oxygen in the feed solution resulting in an ineffective mineralized degradation of nom gu et al 2016 li et al 2014 the specific flux was significantly increased at ufs1 compared under us1 and fs1 suggesting that the synergistic effect between fe ii and uv activation was superior as was hypothesised meanwhile the trend of the specific flux greatly varied under ufs the specific flux was increased during the initial filtration stage this phenomenon was consistent with previous studies which demonstrated that a delayed period was required before flux decline during nf of brackish water this can be attributed to the time required to generate sufficient crystal nuclei in the feed solution lin et al 2021a 2021b this difference also indicated that the ufs hybrid system could effectively delay crystal nucleus formation thereby mitigating membrane fouling membrane fouling was effectively alleviated by increasing oxidant dosage fig 3a and b the final specific flux under ufs2 for example was increased to 0 95 lin et al 2021b studied the effect of ha enhanced gypsum scaling pre oxidation using naclo they found that naclo resulted in continuous aggravation of short term membrane fouling while long term membrane fouling was only slightly alleviated they also found that naclo accelerated the formation of crystal nuclei and damaged the integrity of scaling layer to form a porous structure the average particle size of feed solution crystals also decreased with an increasing dosage of oxidants lin et al 2021a the effectiveness of the hybrid system in alleviating nom enhanced ca2 scaling on membrane fouling was further established via this discrepancy to better assess the advantages of ufs during membrane fouling mitigation additional experiments were performed using natural water from a peninsula in the southeast china in this study the natural water was contaminated by seawater and nom fig s2 similarly the specific flux of ufs2 decreased from 0 92 to 0 81 ufs still exhibited the excellent effects of membrane fouling mitigation effects fig 4 a shows the membrane resistance under different pre treatment conditions based on the resistance calculation formula the rtot of feed solution was 2 6 1014 m 1 the rs was further divided into rr and rir using the cleaning method described in section 2 3 the rir was 0 48 1014 m 1 and the rr was 2 12 1014 m 1 under ufs2 the rr and rir were reduced to 0 21 1013 m 1 and 2 08 1013 m 1 respectively indicating that the hybrid system had an excellent effect on membrane fouling mitigation to further verify the rationality division of rs the flux of the cleaned membrane was measured through the feed solution fig 4b compared with cycle 1 both the initial and final fluxes of the membrane significantly decreased during cycles 2 and 3 the initial flux of cycle 2 was 0 43 that is 0 85 times that of cycle 1 which was close to the ratio of rir to rtot in cycle 1 this phenomenon verified the rationality of irreversible rir previous study has reported that the size of nf membrane pores may increase under high ionic strength al amoudi and lovitt 2007 increased pore sizes reportedly lead to the enhancement of nom adsorption and increase in inorganic ions in addition the hpo fraction of nom and ca2 gets adsorbed at the membrane surface and can be hardly removed via simple physical cleaning roudman and digiano 2000 meanwhile the final flux under ufs2 in the second cycle decreased by 5 18 compared with that in cycle 1 and this value was decreased by 1 85 in cycle 5 this indicated that rir did not increase linearly with the filtration time when the filtration period was extended to 1000 min the final specific flux under ufs2 decreased to 0 81 which was only 0 1 less than that at 200 min the membrane fouling mitigation performance for multi cycle applications was also remarkable furthermore to evaluate the influence of iron ions and sulfate ions on the characteristics of the effluent water the effluent water characteristics of the control and ufs2 groups were measured as presented in table s7 the zeta potential ca2 concentration and doc of the nf effluent decreased under the ufs2 pre treatment combined with the study results by bai et al 2021 it was concluded that the ufs2 process did not aggravate the effluent characteristics after nf 3 2 physicochemical properties of feedwater the two major functional groups of nom were the carboxyl and phenolic groups moreover the density of the phenolic groups was remarkably less than that of the carboxyl groups adusei gyamfi et al 2019 furthermore unlike the phenolic group the carboxyl group dissociated at ph values less than 8 0 because the carboxyl group is relatively more acidic ritchie and perdue 2003 owing to the dissociation of carboxyl group a double electric layer with a large potential surrounded the nom surface which was the most important reason for the negative charge of the nom previous studies have revealed that zeta potential could accurately reflect the charge characteristics of nom owing to the dissociation of carboxyl groups at a ph of 7 0 5 thereby efficiently evaluating the abundance of carboxyl groups bai et al 2021 collins et al 1986 lin et al 2021b yin et al 2020 the maximum zeta potential was 15 2 mv and the doc concentration was 3 71 mg l fig 5 a with an increased dosage of oxidants the zeta potential significantly decreased this might be because the carboxyl concentration in the feed solution decreased owing to the degradation of nom which was also established by the decrease in the doc this phenomenon was inconsistent with previous studies lin et al 2021b xue et al 2016 it was more likely that so 4 had a longer half life 30 40 μs and higher oxidation potential 2 5 3 1 v than oh 20 ns 1 8 2 7 v hence so 4 could effectively react with organic compounds and could improve the mass transfer efficiency thereby destroying the carboxyl structure wang et al 2021 the zeta potential of fs1 was 7 2 mv which was considerably higher than that under the ufs1 group uv light applied as an energy source accelerated the decomposition of the fe and s iv complex thereby improving the reaction efficiency and producing more sulfate radicals in situ compared with those under the us pre treatment the zeta potentials under the fs and ufs pre treatment significantly decreased the flocculation effect of in situ generation of fe iii shielded the negative charge of the nom to evaluate the density of carboxyl groups in the nom the ratio of the zeta potential to the doc could be considered as the approximate concentration of carboxyl groups in the nom the zeta doc significantly decreased with increasing dosage of oxidants table s5 in general decrease in the density and concentration of carboxyl groups may lead to a change in the interaction between carboxyl groups and inorganic ions thereby affecting the mechanisms of membrane fouling several studies have revealed that hpo substances can cause intense membrane fouling al amoudi 2010 tang et al 2011 xu et al 2006 to better understand the variations in nom properties following different pre treatment in the feed solution the hpi and hpo proportions were measured fig 5b eerrors may arise owing to the dilution of doc the control group had more hydrophobic substances than the ufs2 group moreover the hpo substances had a greater impact on membrane fouling therefore uv254 which was more sensitive to hydrophobic substances was used in this study to characterize the fluctuations in the hpo fraction the hpo fraction accounted for 63 7 without pre treatment the hpo ratio gradually decreased and the hpi increased with an increase in the oxidant dosage the mineralization and degradation of hpo were accelerated by the in situ formation of free radicals when fe ii participated in activation the proportion of hpo substances was low this might be because some hpo substances were removed by the flocculation of the fe iii formed in situ compared with those under fs2 and us2 hpo substances were removed more effectively under ufs2 confirming the hypothesis in section 3 1 that uv and fe ii synergistically activated s iv the correlations between different membrane fouling resistances rr and rir and physicochemical properties of the feed solution were systematically estimated the fitting formula and determination coefficients are shown in fig s3 the hpo fraction exhibited a higher linear correlation with rir fig s3b r2 0 9030 than with rr fig s3d r2 0 7324 the hpo substances can be adsorbed and deposited at the membrane surface tang et al 2011 hence thick and smooth scaling layers may have formed when hpo absorbed at the membrane surface a cake enhanced osmotic pressure ceop phenomenon occurred after the formation of this scaling layer which severely hindered the reverse diffusion of solute from the membrane surface to the feed solution the ceop phenomenon also led to the diffusion of solutes in the scaling layer thereby aggravating concentration polarization chong et al 2008 hoek and elimelech 2003 which considerably reduced the electrostatic particle membrane and particle particle interactions the forces which controlled the secondary and tertiary structures of nom were found to change at an extremely high ionic strength at the membrane surface bacchin et al 2002 moreover a slow recombination of nom occurred such that the nom was reorganized into a rigid dense spherical macromolecule at the membrane surface resulted in the increase of rir al amoudi 2010 the hpo fraction also significantly increased linearly with an increase in the zeta potential and zeta doc absolute value r2 0 9607 0 9402 fig s3f and h these results indicated that the total carboxyl group concentration and the carboxyl group density in the nom were positively correlated with the hpo fraction the concentration and density of carboxyl groups in the feed solution were important factors influencing the irreversible resistance this was because ca2 was more likely to form complex with nom which had higher carboxyl group density similarly the relationships of the hpi fraction with resistance zeta potential and zeta doc were the opposite to those of the hpo fraction however the correlation was relatively poor the results showed that the hpo fraction could better predict the changes in rir than the hpi fraction 3 3 variations in the functional group ftir spectra was used to characterize the variations in the nom functional groups fig 6 wavelengths in the range of 1400 1500 cm 1 were considered as amide structures of proteins which were related to the spatial structure α helix of proteins the wavelengths of carboxyl groups were in the range of 1600 1700 cm 1 and the wavelength range of 1000 1200 cm 1 represented ether bonds c o c ho et al 2018 yang et al 2020 after pre treatment the peak intensity of the carboxyl groups weakened indicating that some of the carboxyl groups had been oxidized this was also consistent with the estimation results of the zeta potential moreover the peak in the amide groups weakened indicating effective destruction of proteins chou et al 2016 li et al 2019 the intensity of the carboxyl group peak decreased whereas that of the c o c increased with an increase in the oxidant dosage the carboxyl group can convert to c o c through epoxidation or oxygenation reaction under ufs thus the concentration of free carboxyl group was decreased to avoid forming complex with ca2 al jorani et al 2018 cusso et al 2016 mester et al 2020 yu et al 2018b moreover compared with those under us1 and fs1 the intensity of carboxyl and amide structure peaks remarkably decreased under ufs1 this indicated that the effect on nom removal was superior owing to the synergistic activation of uv and fe ii in addition the synergistic effect seemed to be increased and more efficient at lower concentrations fig 6a and b 3 4 dbps dbps may generate during the treatment process thereby posing threat to human health therefore three typical regulated dbps and bromine dbps br dbps were determined in this study trihalomethane thm was represented by chloroform tcm haloacetic acid haa was represented by dichloroacetic acid dcaa and dichloroacetonirile dcan was represented by haloacetonitrile han zhou et al 2015 br dbps and the control effects of the three kinds of thm control effect are shown in fig s4 the total concentration of dbps with fs was higher than that with us fig 7 this was more likely because the e aq was the major free radical during uv activation which had better control effect on the generation of dbps than oh the concentrations of the regulated dbps tcm dcaa and dcan under ufs2 were decreased to 3 65 6 03 and 3 93 μg l respectively similarly br dbps also exhibited an excellent control effect fig s4 wang et al 2018 established that dbp degradation was a first order reaction at a certain ps concentration 0 0 5 mm this was highly consistent with the decreasing trend of the dbp concentrations in this study when the oxidant dosage increased in addition the positive effects of so 4 on dbp removal were superior than those of oh this was because the reactivity of nom with oh koh nom 2 5 104 l mg 1 s 1 was higher than that with so 4 kso 4 nom 2 103 l mg 1 s 1 hou et al 2018 the steady state concentration of oh under ufs was 2 5 10 13 m whereas it was 2 5 10 12 m under uv h2o2 hua et al 2019 high concentrations of oh and reactivity with nom resulted in increased contents of dbp precursors for example the formation of acetaldehyde after uv h2o2 was 128 higher than that of uv persulfate at the same oxidant dosage inducing a higher yields of dbps xie et al 2015 3 5 bulk crystallization the changes in the carboxyl group concentration in the feed solution affected the complexation with ca2 which might exert a great influence on the particle size distribution and scaling layer at the membrane surface therefore the distribution of nanometre scale particles of bulk crystals in the feed solution was monitored fig 8 during the filtration process bulk crystallizations and different sizes were developed in feed solution without treatment the average particle size of feed solution decreased with oxidant addition exerting an inhibiting effect on bulk crystallizations with an increase in the oxidant dosage the average particle size distribution further decreased to 4 85 nm under ufs2 the mechanisms of the hybrid system on nom enhanced bulk crystallization were further revealed during the activation of fe ii more reactive and electropositive fe iii were formed in situ therefore the carboxyl groups were more likely to preferentially bind with fe iii thereby weakening the bridging effect of ca2 on nom as well as bulk crystallization mi and elimelech 2008 therefore the average particle size of the feed solution was significantly decreased under the ufs treatment in addition correlation analysis results showed that both rr and rir were positively correlated with the particle size 100 nm fraction correspondingly the linear relationship between average particle size and resistance was weaker than that between resistance and particle size 100 nm fraction indicating that the particle size 100 nm fraction could better predict the variations in the membrane resistances the linear r2 and pearson r regression analysis as well as the significance analysis p of zeta or zeta doc with particle size distribution were performed table s6 the p value of either zeta or zeta doc with particle size distribution passed the α 0 005 detection threshold therefore both zeta and zeta doc had significant impacts on the particle size distribution this hypothesis was also confirmed by the calculation results of r2 and r bulk crystallization had a higher correlation with rir r2 0 9017 than with rr r2 0 8826 which was helpful for understanding the mitigation mechanisms 3 6 surface crystallization the foulant concentration and scaling layer morphology affected the membrane flux and resistance consequently the morphologies of the scaling layer were further scanned via sem fig 9 at a proportional scale the inorganic scaling in the control group was significantly large and the cake layer was dense nf membrane surfaces were typically negatively charged owing to the dissociation of functional groups carboxyl and amino groups it is known that nom is also negatively charged which results in electrostatic repulsion between the membrane surface and nom meanwhile the debye length was inversely proportional to the square of ionic strength thus debye length decreased at high ionic concentrations implying that the double electric layer was thinner under electrostatic repulsion the compression of the double electric layer results in a decrease in the energy barrier which was conducive to the aggregation and settlement of nom at the membrane surface tang et al 2011 in addition the scaling layer was considerably stacked thereby aggravating membrane fouling the crystallization in fig 9a was partly rough and partly smooth the rough crystallization was more likely generated by nom and ca2 complexation whereas the smooth scaling layer tended to be inorganic crystallization the size of inorganic structure at the membrane surface remarkably decreased and porous structures appeared with oxidant addition this porous structure appeared more readily when fe ii was involved in the activation process fig 9b d it was reasonable to conclude that the formation of porous structure was related to the flocculation of fe iii formed in situ during the reaction process moreover this porous structure could mitigate membrane fouling and effectively improve the membrane flux it is well known that the roughness of membrane surface influences the interaction energy and membrane fouling hence monitoring the variations in the membrane surface roughness was necessary fig 10 shows the afm diagrams of the membrane surface under different pre treatment conditions for the control group the average deviation ra and root mean square rms were 71 75 nm and 89 65 nm respectively which indicated surface roughness gao et al 2021 this was likely attributed to the fact that nom was adsorbed on the membrane surface and enhanced the bulk crystallization of ca2 however crystallization accumulated at the membrane surface evidenced through sem these two reasons led to the increase in the membrane surface roughness the electrostatic repulsion between foulants and the membrane decreased owing to the increase in roughness bowen and doneva 2000 moreover foulants were preferentially deposited in the valley region of the rough structures because of the relatively strong adhesion force at this area the surface shear rate and acid base polar interaction in the valley region were weakened resulting in severe membrane fouling however the ra and rms decreased to 43 18 nm and 55 46 nm under ufs2 respectively indicating that the surface roughness was significantly reduced under hybrid system the ca2 concentration in the scaling layer was measured to characterize the variations in crystallization at the membrane surface after oxidation the ca2 concentration on the membrane surface reached 35 854 mg m2 without pre treatment indicating that the surface crystallization primarily comprised of ca2 fig 11 furthermore carboxyl groups and polysaccharides significantly enhanced ca2 crystallization this number decreased to 25 551 mg m2 under ufs1 and declined steadily to 11 532 mg m2 with the addition of oxidants the variations in the ca2 concentration at membrane surface were further analyzed from the perspective of intermolecular forces and nf membrane rejection mechanism during oxidation the carboxyl group was attacked by free radicals the ca2 concentration in the scaling layer was declined with a decrease in the carboxyl concentration moreover more reactive and electropositive fe iii was generated in situ during the activation of sulfite by fe ii then the fe iii formed in situ were preferentially bound to nom when competing with ca2 for nom adsorption sites therefore the complexation of ca2 to nom was further weakened this also explained why the ca2 concentration under us2 was considerably higher than those under fs2 and ufs2 combining fe iii and the membrane functional groups was more likely to cause a decrease in the charge density at the membrane surface or even render the charge reversal in this case the interception mechanism was affected by the donnan and dielectric effects the electrostatic attraction of membrane was also changed to electrostatic repulsion of ca2 which further decreased ca2 concentration the linear fitting of ca2 and membrane resistance also established that ca2 concentration in the scaling layer was an important factor influencing rir 3 7 mechanism of oxidation influenced membrane fouling behaviors to further explore the treatment mechanism of ufs in terms of the interfacial interaction energies the curves of interface interaction energy between foulants and membrane were drawn fig 12 and the surface free energy is listed in table s4 the glw lw gab ab and gel el represented the van der waals interaction polar interaction force and electrostatic interaction interface free energy respectively the sum of the three constitutes the total interface free energy yang et al 2021 the g131 represented cohesive free energy whereas g132 represented adhesive free energy the total interaction energy had a maximum value called the energy barrier which was expressed as the energy that has to be overcome for binding to the membrane surface zhang et al 2022 without pre treatment the energy barrier was only 241 47 mj m2 this was consistent with the conclusion that a small energy barrier was formed owing to the compression of double electric layer under high ionic strength the ab and el interactions were repulsive forces between foulants and membrane occurring over the entire separation distance whereas the lw interaction acted as an attraction the strength of the interaction between two planar surfaces could be quantified by the specific energy of contact at the energy barrier the specific energies of lw ab and el exhibited no remarkable differences however the ab interaction was changed with oxidant addition the effective distance of the ab interaction between the foulants and membrane was considerably longer than those of el and lw interactions in addition the specific contact energy of the ab interaction accounted for 69 of the total contact energy under ufs2 indicating that ab interaction played a key role in binding the foulants to the membranes this conclusion was also consistent with results in surface free energy value in table s4 and previous studies zhang et al 2020 zhao et al 2016 the correlation between the energy barrier and membrane resistance under different treatment conditions is shown in fig 12h and i both reversible and irreversible resistance decreased with increasing of energy barrier indicating that there was a strong negative linear correlation between energy barrier and membrane resistance this showed that with addition of oxidant and increase in dosage the energy required by foulant to overcome for binding to the membrane surface increased hence membrane fouling was effectively alleviated in addition to the linear correlation analysis pearson correlation analysis was used in this study to further determine indicators related to membrane resistance as shown in fig 13 as well as significance detection p in si all the absolute values of the correlation coefficients between irreversible resistance and each parameter were higher than 0 9 the ratio of the zeta potential r 0 98 zeta doc r 0 95 hpi ratio r 0 91 particle size 100 nm ratio r 0 97 and energy barrier r 0 94 showed excellent negative correlation indicating that decrease in the value of above indicators were beneficial for reducing the rir correspondingly hpo ratio r 0 95 particle size 100 nm ratio r 0 97 and ca2 concentration at the membrane surface r 0 92 were highly positively correlated with rir the proportion of zeta potential hpo ratio and particle size 100 nm ratio had a strong correlation with rir r 0 95 it was more appropriate to predict the variations in the irreversible resistance by measuring the above indicators similarly the p values between membrane resistance and each parameter were all less than 0 01 indicating that the detection parameters had a substantial influence on the changes in rr and rir with the exception of hpo and rr p 0 014 to comprehensively analyze the contribution rate of different free radicals to the mineralization degradation of nom during the oxidation process this study used electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy as well as explored the smx removal rate of ufs2 under different quenchers compared with the control group ufs2 group exhibited remarkable peak fluctuations indicating the generation of hydroxyl and sulfate radicals fig s6 ufs meoh represented methanol as a quencher whereas ufs tba represented tertiary butanol as a quencher fig s5 previous studies reported that methanol had a good quenching effect on so 4 and oh therefore smx was primarily degraded by e aq under ufs meoh thus e aq obtained a degradation efficiency of 25 1 moreover tert butanol had an excellent quenching effect on oh but had little effect on so 4 it was found that smx was primarily degraded by e aq and so 4 under ufs tba bai et al 2021 qiu et al 2019 based on the differences in the smx degradation rate between ufs meoh and ufs tba the degradation efficiency of so 4 was calculated as 54 8 whereas that of oh was 22 1 it was established that so 4 played a major role in nom degradation in the ufs system notably that the degradation rate of smx after tert butanol quenching reached 79 9 which was 10 5 higher than that under ufs therefore the formation of oh followed the consumption of so 4 consequently the consumption of so 4 was reduced owing to the quenching of oh by tert butanol thereby increasing the degradation rate of smx based on the above analysis the mitigation mechanism of ufs on nom enhanced ca2 scaling during nf was briefly described fig 14 with the use of ufs hybrid systems there were at least four different effects on nom including the mineralization of nom decrease in the carboxyl density change in scale layer structure and competitive complexation between fe iii and ca2 under the synergistic action of the above four effects membrane fouling was greatly alleviated 3 8 economic implications the above study primarily evaluated the ufs process from the aspect of the membrane fouling mitigation effect considering practical applications this study compared the economic differences between the control and ufs2 the computation details of power consumption and cost are presented in table s8 owing to regional disparities in chemicals and electricity costs this study uniformly considered the current scenario in the author s region without pre treatment the power consumption of nf treatment was 5850 kwh per ton and the power consumption per ton was reduced to 1600 kwh under ufs2 furthermore the total cost per ton water was approximately reduced by 74 this proportion may be even higher considering the decay of membrane life without treatment certainly the actual operational cost should be determined for wider practical applications however the ufs process could evidently reduce operational costs and has potential to practical applications 4 conclusion surface water polluted by seawater erosion and organic matter was simulated in this study the purpose of this study was to explore the fouling mitigation effect of nom enhanced ca2 scaling during nanofiltration the mechanisms of the uv fe ii s iv hybrid system in mitigating membrane fouling were also further explored filtration experiments revealed that uv and fe ii had remarkable synergistic effects on the activation of s iv resulting in effective membrane fouling mitigation in addition the rationality of the irreversible resistance division of nom enhanced ca2 scaling during nf was verified the linearly positive correlations between rir and the proportion of hydrophobic substances carboxyl density and particle size were established using correlation analysis during ufs treatment the concentration and density of carboxyl on nom significantly decreased owing to the attack of three free radicals so 4 oh and e aq fe iii formed in situ during the activation process competed with ca2 for the complex active sites in the nom more reactive and electropositive fe iii formed in situ preferentially bound to carboxyl groups severely limiting ca2 crystallization this also resulted in particle size decrease effectively reducing the bulk crystallization size furthermore hpo substances could cause severe membrane fouling than hpi substances with the use of ufs hpo substances were effectively degraded and mineralized thereby weakening the adsorption at the membrane surface and further reducing the development of irreversible resistance finally the quenching experiment revealed that so 4 was the major active radical in nom fouling mitigation and the inhibition of oh generation was more likely to further

15607,precipitation can affect the residence time of nitrogen compounds and temperature can influence nitrogen transformation in soil therefore we hypothesized that climate factors can affect the emissions of n2o an important greenhouse gas produced via nitrogen transformation by influencing the migration and transformation of nonpoint source nitrogen in soil to test this hypothesis and quantify the effect of climate factors on n2o emissions the swat model and the modified swat n2o coupler were used to study the effect of climate factors on the migration and transformation of nonpoint source nitrogen and n2o emissions in an agricultural watershed from 2009 to 2018 temperature affected n2o emissions more significant than precipitation and n2o emissions increased with temperature and reached a plateau when the average monthly temperature was 23 0 c the n2o emissions first increased rapidly with precipitation due to the increase in moisture however when the average monthly precipitation reached 78 8 mm the n2o emissions began to decrease because the residence time of nitrogen compounds in soil were reduced due to fast removal via runoff which inhibits n2o emissions under the context of climate change with three scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 rcp8 5 temperature would increase gradually while precipitation would not change significantly from 2021 to 2080 as a result the changes would increase n2o emissions by 6 7 32 3 and 70 7 respectively this study quantifies the feedback of n2o emissions to climate change in croplands providing a scientific basis for climate change mitigation and agricultural management graphical abstarct image graphical abstract keywords climate change nonpoint source pollution migration transformation n2o emissions data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction nitrous oxide n2o is an important greenhouse gas that has attracted increasing attention maaz et al 2021 wang et al 2021a shcherbak et al 2014 yang et al 2021 it plays a key role in global climate change due to its long residence in the troposphere and the role of stratospheric ozone depletion through photochemical processes ravishankara et al 2009 fiat et al 2019 the n2o potential greenhouse effect of a molecule is 298 times higher than that of co2 signor and cerri 2013 tian et al 2017 therefore it is very important to explore the influencing factors of n2o emissions for formulating emission reduction policies cropland soil is one of the most important sources contributing to the increase in n2o concentrations thompson et al 2019 accounting for approximately 25 of total global n2o emissions in nitrogen davidson and kanter 2014 reay et al 2012 soil microorganisms dominate denitrification with nitrate nitrogen no3 n as the reaction substrate and nitrification with ammonium nitrogen nh4 n as the reaction substrate and these processes are the most important ways to produce n2o in soil zhao et al 2020 temperature can affect the enzyme activity of microorganisms and influence the n2o emissions it has been reported that the activity of microorganisms in soil gradually increases with temperature duan et al 2019 koponen et al 2004 and soil moisture also influences the activity of microorganisms feng et al 2018 thus affecting nitrification and denitrification processes and the production of n2o in addition as the substrates for n2o production mainly come from the application of nitrogen fertilizer chen et al 2019 ren et al 2020 zhou et al 2018 the production of n2o will depend on the residence time of nitrogen fertilizer in cropland soils soil moisture is influenced by precipitation zhong et al 2018 in addition precipitation plays an important role in controlling the migration of nonpoint source nitrogen by influencing hydrological processes in watersheds perera et al 2015 wu et al 2012 if precipitation increases surface water yield will increase which results in an increase in total nitrogen tn loss from soils wang et al 2018b and a decrease in the residence time of nitrogen fertilizer in soils therefore the migration and transformation of nitrogen compounds and the production of n2o in soils will be influenced by climate factors including precipitation and temperature based on this deduction we hypothesized that changes in climate factors could influence n2o emissions by affecting the migration and transformation of nonpoint source nitrogen in soils to test this hypothesis and quantify the effect of climate factors on n2o emissions the swat soil and water assessment tool model wang et al 2018a 2016 was used to simulate the hydrologic process and the migration and transformation of nonpoint source nitrogen in addition as model simulation is an effective method used to study the temporal and spatial variation in n2o emissions at a watershed scale gao et al 2020 wagena et al 2017 zhou et al 2015 the swat n2o coupler which we developed previously by collecting 4488 measurements from around the world gao et al 2019 was modified to simulate the n2o emissions based on the output of soil nitrogen soil moisture and soil temperature from the swat model we selected the weihe upstream watershed a subbasin of the yellow river as the study area which was mainly composed of croplands with a proportion of 44 55 we used the swat model to simulate hydrologic processes climate conditions the migration and transformation of nonpoint source nitrogen at the same time we also used the modified swat n2o coupler to simulate n2o emissions from 2009 to 2018 based on this we also predicted the temperature precipitation and n2o emissions in the weihe upstream watershed from 2021 to 2080 under the context of climate change with three scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 rcp8 5 via this study we can learn to what extent that climate factors can affect n2o emissions through influencing nonpoint source nitrogen 2 materials and methods 2 1 mechanism concept and simulation about the effect of climate factors on n2o emissions from cropland soils climate factors can affect n2o emissions by influencing the migration and transformation of nonpoint source nitrogen in an agricultural watershed fig 1 after nonpoint source nitrogen is imported into the soil a series of biochemical processes will occur in the soil zhao et al 2020 climate factors can affect the migration and transformation of nonpoint source nitrogen by changing physical and chemical properties and hydrologic processes in soil wang et al 2019 which would affect n2o emissions these processes can be simulated by swat model the swat model is a semi distributed hydrological model that is mainly used to simulate cycles of nutrients and hydrology wang et al 2019 2020 the weather data topography data soil data land management data and land use data can be used to simulate the variation in soil temperature soil moisture and various forms of nitrogen in the soil and nitrogen concentration data in the river and sediment and flow data for the river can be used to calibrate and validate the model the swat n2o coupler was used to simulate the n2o emissions in this study gao et al 2019 the swat n2o coupler is a tool that can read the soil parameters soil nitrogen soil moisture and soil temperature output by the swat model for each hydrologic response unit hru and then export n2o emissions at the hru scale these functions were written in python and packaged on arcgis platforms as tools 2 2 the study area the weihe river is located on the loess plateau of china and is the largest tributary of the yellow river to eliminate the influence of industrial source nitrogen in the midstream and downstream the weihe upstream watershed was selected as the study area due to industrial underdevelopment cropland grassland and forest are the main land use types in the weihe upstream watershed and nonpoint source nitrogen in this area mainly comes from agriculture the topography of the weihe upstream watershed is high in the west and low in the east the geomorphologic types are mainly hills and gullies the weihe upstream watershed is located in a temperate monsoon climate zone with warm and rainy summers and cold and dry winters zhao et al 2019 precipitation is mainly concentrated in july october accounting for more than 60 of the annual precipitation zhou et al 2020 fig 2 because the formula in the swat n2o coupler was developed based on global data we modified it to fit the actual situation of the weihe upstream watershed this study modified the formula in the swat n2o coupler with our field observation data and literature data li et al 2018 sun et al 2018 xiao 2019 wang 2014 yan et al 2013 including 44 sets of soil n2o emissions g n ha 1 day 1 soil no3 n mg kg soil temperature c and soil moisture vol from six sampling sites the following is the modified formula 1 n 2 o s o i l 3 340 0 352 s n 0 080 s t 0 040 s w where n 2 o s o i l s n s t and s w are the soil n2o emissions g n ha 1 day 1 soil no3 n concentration mg kg soil temperature c and soil moisture vol respectively then we used the modified swat n2o coupler to simulate n2o emissions in the weihe upstream watershed 2 3 calibration and validation methods we used swat cup for calibration and validation and selected sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi2 as the calibration algorithm the performance of the swat model was evaluated by using the nash sutcliffe efficiency n s e and coefficient of determination r 2 as objective functions the following are the formulas for calculating n s e and r 2 2 n s e i 1 n r i r 2 i 1 n s i r i 2 i 1 n r i r 2 3 r 2 i 1 n r i r s i s 2 i 1 n r i r 2 i 1 n s i s 2 where r i is the i t h realistic value r is the mean value of

three climate scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 from 2021 to 2080 were obtained by using the regional climate model regcm4 4 the 25 km resolution climate change simulation was conducted by regcm4 4 driven by the cmip5 model of hadgem2 es gao et al 2017 han et al 2017 shi et al 2018 quantile delta mapping was further employed to correct the systematic biases cannon et al 2015 han et al 2019 tong et al 2021 when all the data were ready we first used the monthly nh3 n data in the river from january 2012 to october 2017 and the monthly flow and sediment data from january 2002 to december 2017 to calibrate and validate the swat model for stream flow and sediments the calibration period was from 2002 to 2012 and the validation period was from 2013 to 2017 for nh3 n the calibration period was from 2012 to 2015 and the validation period was from 2015 to 2017 then we used the modified swat n2o coupler to read soil nitrogen soil moisture and soil temperature data output from the swat model so that the daily data of n2o emissions from the weihe upstream watershed from 2009 to 2018 were obtained at the same time running the swat model we could obtain a large amount of daily climate hydrological and nonpoint source nitrogen data 2 5 data analysis we obtained daily n2o emissions temperature tmp precipitation prcp sediment yield sy water yield wy surface runoff sr nitrates taken by surface runoff ntsr total nitrates lost tnl including the nitrate taken by surface runoff soil runoff and groundwater runoff and total organic nitrogen lost tonl at the hru scale from 2009 to 2018 according to the method of area weighting the hru data were summarized for the subbasin and then averaged to obtain the daily average data of the subbasin 4 p j s u b m k i 1 n p j h r u i k a r e a h

the areas of h r u n and s u b m respectively in addition n is the number of hrus in s u b m then the daily data of the parameters of the subbasin were obtained by averaging the daily data over ten

to form the annual mean daily data for instance 7 p 0101 p 20090101 p 20100101 p 20180101 10 as there were few paddy fields in the study area urban areas had more hardened ground and the area was small we did not consider the n2o emissions of these land use types so we selected cropland forest and grassland for single factor anova the kolmogorov smirnov test was used to examine the normal distribution of environmental factors and n2o emissions for the non normally distributed variables we log transformed or exponentially transformed the data to compare the differences in n2o emissions between different land use types we used one way anova then we fitted the relationship between n2o emissions and environmental factors we also used stepwise regression analysis on related variables to examine multivariable relationships between n2o emissions and environmental factors all statistical analyzes used spss 19 0 software with a significance level of p 0 05 and origin 8 0 software was used to draw figures arcgis 10 4 was used to show the general situation of the study area and the spatial distribution of parameters python was used for data integration 3 results and discussions 3 1 calibration and validation of the swat model the n s e and r 2 values for stream flow and total sediment through river sections during calibration and validation periods were higher than 0 65 fig s1a and b which indicated that the simulations were good the n s e and r 2 values for the content of nh3 n in the river water during the calibration periods were 0 6 and 0 56 respectively and they were 0 85 and 0 63 during the validation periods respectively fig s1c such calibration and validation results showed that the model could be used to simulate the migration and transformation of nonpoint source pollution in the weihe upstream watershed 3 2 spatial variation in n2o emissions with land use types and subbasins using meteorological data from 2009 to 2018 as input to the model we obtained the data on daily n2o emissions and other related environmental factors in the weihe upstream watershed from 2009 to 2018 the n2o emissions from cropland 66 91 94 75 g ha 1 day 1 were significantly higher than those from grassland 17 66 7 05 g ha 1 day 1 forest 17 28 6 55 g ha 1 day 1 and unclassified land 0 83 0 34 g ha 1 day 1 fig s2 the n2o emissions showed great spatial variation which was mainly controlled by land use types figs 2 and s3 overall cropland was mainly located in the western and northeastern regions fig 2 which had high n2o emissions 3 81 5 58 g ha 1 day 1 the main land use types in the southeast and southwest regions were forestlands and grasslands fig 2 which had low n2o emissions 1 17 0 44 g ha 1 day 1 for the 20th subbasin and 21st subbasin although they had the same climatic and hydrological conditions fig s4 the n2o emissions of the 20th subbasin mainly covered by cropland were higher than those of the 21st subbasin mainly covered by forest figs 2 and s3 table s1 because the 20th subbasin received more fertilizer ren et al 2020 cropland in the west and northeast regions also caused the n2o emissions to be significantly higher than those in forestland and grassland located in the southeast and southwest regions figs 2 and s3 this result indicated that fertilization played a positive role in n2o emissions moreover temperature and precipitation could affect the spatial distribution of n2o emissions and the n2o emissions were at the highest levels in fig s3 only when temperatures and precipitation were within the appropriate range rather than when reaching the maximum figs s3 and s4 for instance for the 2nd 13th 14th 16th 23th and 28th subbasins the proportion of croplands in these subbasins reached 57 6 60 0 60 7 64 0 60 7 and 79 1 respectively and all of them were typical croplands table s1 although the precipitation in the 2nd 13th 14th 16th subbasins were lower than those of 23th and 28th subbasins the n2o emissions of the former were not only higher than the latter but also at the highest level among all the subbasins of the study area this was because the lower precipitation of the 2nd 13th 14th 16th subbasins led to the lower nitrogen loss which benefited the n2o emissions figs s3 and s4 3 3 temporal variation in environmental factors and n2o emissions in the model we set up the same fertilization measures for croplands in march may and june to simulate real management under the influence of peaked precipitation sediment yield water yield and surface runoff also peaked in summer especially in july for the whole weihe upstream watershed fig s5b d nitrates taken by surface runoff ntsr increased after three fertilizations to different degrees the nitrates taken by surface runoff for one month was 1 89 105 kg after the first fertilization for the whole weihe upstream watershed then it decreased to 1 53 105 kg 6 31 104 kg after the second and third fertilization respectively and it had a peak value again in july 8 38 104 kg fig s5e this may because permeability of soil was not good due to it was dry for a long time before march so it was easy to generated surface runoff and then took away the nitrate as soil moisture increased the soil permeability became better so a large amount of nitrate was lost by infiltration rather than surface runoff in july when precipitation was at the peak of the year the rain generated surface runoff before it seeped so the nitrates taken by surface runoff increased again however total nitrates lost tnl was highest after the second fertilization 1 59 106 kg and lowest after the first fertilization 2 89 105 kg in addition the total nitrates lost was still very high in july september and october without fertilizer application fig s5e the total organic nitrogen lost tonl was minimally affected by fertilization and its value peaked in july 2 56 106 kg and september 3 81 106 kg corresponding to the peak time of water yield fig s5e since total organic nitrogen lost contained dissolved organic nitrogen the value of it was not only related to sediment yield but also to water yield therefore although sediment yield in september was lower than in july total organic nitrogen lost was higher in september than in july because water yield in september 5 78 107 m3 was higher than that of july 4 73 107 m3 after each fertilization the n2o emissions increased dramatically and reached a peak then n2o emissions began to decrease and each range of decrease the proportion of the decrease from the highest value to the lowest value was different in three fertilizations the range of decrease in march 9 31 was significantly smaller than that in may 61 30 and june 52 19 and after june the n2o emissions continued to decline the peak values of n2o emissions after three fertilizations were different and the n2o emissions in march 3 81 g ha 1 day 1 were smaller than those in may 11 18 g ha 1 day 1 and june 12 95 g ha 1 day 1 fig s5 and the monthly n2o emissions in march 5 39 108 g were also lower than those in may 1 34 109 g and june 1 30 109 g for the whole weihe upstream watershed when the first fertilization applied in early march the n2o emissions increased dramatically after the peak n2o emissions they did not decrease significantly mainly because of the low total nitrates lost caused by the low precipitation in the weihe upstream watershed in march fig s5a only a tiny fraction of the nitrogen in the soil was washed into the river because of the low water yield fig s5c and e wang et al 2018b although the nitrates taken by surface runoff were higher than those in the later fertilization periods fig s5e it did not have much impact on the n2o emissions because of the lower total nitrates lost than those in the later fertilization periods fig s5e at this time nitrogen was relatively sufficient for microorganisms so there was only a slight decrease in n2o emissions when the second fertilization applied in early may the n2o emissions increased dramatically which was caused by the high temperature and sufficient moisture fig s5a c davidson and swank 1986 however after the peak n2o emissions a sharp decline occurred fig s5e it has been reported that ammonia in the soil volatilizes easily under higher temperatures duan et al 2019 koponen et al 2004 wang et al 2021b which limits nitrification and reduces n2o emissions in may the precipitation was significantly higher than that in march fig s5a and the increase in water yield resulting from high precipitation could cause nitrate loss in the soil fig s5a c and e zhang et al 2020 accelerating the decrease in n2o emissions moreover the value of total nitrates lost was very high in may fig s5e but the value of nitrates taken by surface runoff was relatively low fig s5e which indicated that more nitrates infiltrated into the deep soil were washed into the river by water flow than the amount after the first fertilization nitrates in deep soil might be more likely to produce n2o because of anaerobic conditions hu et al 2015 so the loss of this part of nitrates accelerates the decrease in n2o emissions when the third fertilization applied in early june the n2o emissions also increased dramatically under higher temperatures and precipitation fig s5a after the peak n2o emissions the n2o emissions continued to decrease until the next fertilization in the next year fig s5e during this period the loss of nitrogen still existed fig s5e which caused n2o emissions to decrease rapidly after increasing unlike the second fertilization the total organic nitrogen lost began to increase because of further increases in precipitation fig s5e in july and september the high values of total organic nitrogen lost and water yield indicated that the increase in water yield caused soil erosion lin et al 2020 fig s5c e because organic nitrogen is attached to sediments organic nitrogen can be washed into rivers with sediments as soil erosion occurs kiani et al 2018 during this period the dissolved nitrates converted by organic nitrogen also entered the river by the water flow fig s5e which accelerated the decrease in n2o emissions compared with march there were higher temperatures and precipitation in june which were beneficial to the production of n2o fig 3 however compared with may there were excessive temperatures and precipitation in june which created factors that were detrimental to the production of n2o thus the n2o emissions were lower than those in may fig 4 3 4 relationships between n2o emissions and climate as well as other environmental factors precipitation and n2o emissions r2 0 78 fig 3 as well as temperature and n2o emissions r2 0 80 fig 3 could be fitted to quadratic functions such functions told us that as precipitation increased the n2o emissions first increased and then decreased additionally as temperature increased the n2o emissions first increased and then the rate of increase decreased when the average monthly precipitation and average monthly temperature reached 78 8 mm and 23 0 c respectively then the n2o emissions began to decrease with precipitation and the rate of increase in n2o emissions was zero with temperature respectively for the hydrology a relationship between water yield and n2o emissions could be fitted to a power function r2 0 75 fig 5 b the relationships between surface runoff r2 0 73 fig 5a sediment yield r2 0 39 fig 5c and n2o emissions could be fitted to logarithmic functions they told us that as water yield surface runoff sediment yield increased the n2o emissions began to increase rapidly and then the degree of increase gradually weakened for the migration of nonpoint source nitrogen relationships between nitrate taken by surface runoff r2 0 45 fig 5d total nitrate lost r2 0 74 fig 5e total organic nitrogen lost r2 0 40 fig 5f and n2o emissions could be fitted to logarithmic functions this result told us that as nitrates taken by surface runoff total nitrates lost and total organic nitrogen lost increased n2o emissions began to increase rapidly and the degree of increase gradually declined stepwise regression analysis showed that standardized coefficients of related factors were sorted as sno3 stmp sprcp swy stnl this result reflected that no3 was the reaction substrate for n2o emissions and was the most important factor of n2o emissions the standardized coefficients of total nitrates lost and water yield were both negative because the increase of water yield will result in the increase of total nitrate lost and then the decrease of soil nitrate content which directly inhibited n2o emissions table s2 the contribution of temperature change to n2o emissions variation was higher than that of precipitation it could be concluded from the stepwise regression analysis that temperature played an important role in controlling n2o emissions and precipitation had complex effects on n2o emissions table s2 3 5 changes in n2o emissions in future climate scenarios to simulate n2o emissions using future climate data the following formula was acquired from a fitting of the n2o emissions data with the climate data of the weihe upstream watershed 8 ln n 2 o 3 0 04 lo g 10 prcp 0 85 ln tmp 5 0 83 r 2 0 70 the regional climate model regcm4 4 and three climate scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 were used to simulate the future climate between 2021 and 2080 the result showed that under three climate scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the global average temperature around 2080 rise by 1 85 2 98 and 4 56 c compared to before the industrial revolution then future climate data are used to bring in formula 8 to obtain future n2o emissions data in rcp2 6 the changes in temperature and precipitation are 0 043 c 10 y and 0 021 mm 10 y respectively fig s6a under rcp4 5 the changes in temperature and precipitation are 0 375 c 10 y and 0 002 mm 10 y respectively fig s6b under rcp8 5 the changes in temperature and precipitation are 0 704 c 10 y and 0 022 mm 10 y respectively fig s6c all of the changes of precipitation do not pass the significance test and the changes of temperature do not pass the significance test in rcp2 6 this result reflects that the increasing rates of temperature and precipitation are higher under higher intensity rcp scenarios as a result the changes in n2o emissions would be 0 010 g ha day 10 y 0 090 g ha day 10 y and 0 180 g ha day 10 y respectively and the enhancement would also be stronger under higher intensity rcp scenarios under the context of climate change with three scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 rcp8 5 the n2o emissions in the last decade 2071 2080 of predicted time period in the future would increase by 6 70 32 30 and 70 69 respectively compared with those in the first decade 2021 2030 of predicted time period in the future therefore the weihe upstream watershed should take corresponding reduction measures to control n2o emissions under future climate change in addition the weihe upstream watershed is located in the semi arid area the temperature will increase significantly but the precipitation will not increase significantly resulting in limited nitrogen loss in the future as a consequence n2o emissions will increase significantly in the future therefore this prediction results may be applicable to the climate area similar to the weihe upstream watershed in the future under climate change we found that temperature will be the main positive factor controlling n2o emissions compared with precipitation due to the complex effects of precipitation on the migration of nonpoint source pollutants at different times the effect of precipitation on n2o emissions is uncertain in the future it has been reported that the temperature in the weihe upstream watershed will increase in the future precipitation will decrease and the total extreme precipitation will also decrease zhou et al 2020 with the decrease in extreme precipitation the nitrogen washed into the river will decrease in a short period of time which will increase n2o emissions however if the reduced precipitation is concentrated in spring it is not conducive to n2o emissions therefore it is necessary to determine the seasonal variation in precipitation in the weihe upstream watershed to more precisely predict the effect of climate change on n2o emissions in the future in addition land use affects the migration of nonpoint source pollutants and land use changes over time wang et al 2018a therefore it is also necessary to explore how land use will affect n2o emissions by the migration of nonpoint source pollutants yan et al 2022 3 6 implications and limitations this research indicated that climate factors can affect n2o emissions by influencing the migration and transformation of nonpoint source nitrogen in an agricultural watershed fig 1 although field experimental research considered the effect of climate factors on n2o emissions gaihre et al 2014 rabot et al 2016 wu et al 2017 it did not analyze the change in n2o emissions from the aspect of the migration of nitrogen which was well compensated by our study in addition by means of a model rather than an experiment we could obtain long term daily data to give a more detailed characterization of temporal variations in n2o emissions moreover we established a formula for n2o emissions and climate parameters based on data from 2009 2018 and predicted n2o emissions based on future climate change scenarios from 2021 to 2080 however many results showed that microbial enzyme activity played an important role in n2o emissions duan et al 2019 koponen et al 2004 su et al 2019 nitrification and denitrification were essentially microbial driven and sometimes microbial enzyme activity played a decisive role on n2o emissions our model only considered soil temperature soil moisture and contents of nitrates so we should add microbial enzyme activity data to simulate n2o emissions more accurately in the future proper rainfall can increase soil moisture and promote n2o emissions the surface runoff generated by excessive rainfall can promote the entry of nonpoint source nitrogen into rivers wu et al 2012 but at the same time reduce n2o emissions from cultivated soil the entry of nonpoint source nitrogen into rivers and lakes will not only reduce the use efficiency of nitrogen fertilizer but also elevate the nitrogen concentration in waters affect the water quality and cause the eutrophication of lakes chen et al 2013 moreover the nitrogen compounds entering rivers and lakes will be transformed and release n2o liu et al 2013a 2013b therefore it is necessary to study the relationships among nitrogen fertilizer application greenhouse gas emissions and climate change at the watershed scale to provide a scientific basis for greenhouse gas emission reduction and agricultural management 4 conclusions the swat model and the modified swat n2o coupler were used to simulate the n2o emissions as well as the relevant environmental factors in the weihe upstream watershed different land uses could lead to different n2o emissions and the n2o emissions in cropland were the highest among different land use types temperature played an important role in controlling n2o emissions and precipitation had complex effects on n2o emissions the n2o emissions first increased and reached a plateau at 23 0 c and then the rate of increase decreased with temperature the n2o emissions was inhibited under excessive heating conditions probably because of the volatilization of ammonia the n2o emissions first increased rapidly with precipitation due to the increase in moisture which might have promoted microbial activity and created anoxic conditions however when the average monthly precipitation reached 78 8 mm the n2o emissions began to decrease because the residence time of nitrogen compounds in soil were reduced due to fast removal via runoff which inhibited n2o emissions in the future under the three scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 rcp8 5 higher temperature might lead to greater n2o emissions while insignificant changes in precipitation might have little effect on n2o emissions in the weihe upstream watershed credit authorship contribution statement jing huang conceptualization methodology writing original draft ruimin liu project

15607,precipitation can affect the residence time of nitrogen compounds and temperature can influence nitrogen transformation in soil therefore we hypothesized that climate factors can affect the emissions of n2o an important greenhouse gas produced via nitrogen transformation by influencing the migration and transformation of nonpoint source nitrogen in soil to test this hypothesis and quantify the effect of climate factors on n2o emissions the swat model and the modified swat n2o coupler were used to study the effect of climate factors on the migration and transformation of nonpoint source nitrogen and n2o emissions in an agricultural watershed from 2009 to 2018 temperature affected n2o emissions more significant than precipitation and n2o emissions increased with temperature and reached a plateau when the average monthly temperature was 23 0 c the n2o emissions first increased rapidly with precipitation due to the increase in moisture however when the average monthly precipitation reached 78 8 mm the n2o emissions began to decrease because the residence time of nitrogen compounds in soil were reduced due to fast removal via runoff which inhibits n2o emissions under the context of climate change with three scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 rcp8 5 temperature would increase gradually while precipitation would not change significantly from 2021 to 2080 as a result the changes would increase n2o emissions by 6 7 32 3 and 70 7 respectively this study quantifies the feedback of n2o emissions to climate change in croplands providing a scientific basis for climate change mitigation and agricultural management graphical abstarct image graphical abstract keywords climate change nonpoint source pollution migration transformation n2o emissions data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction nitrous oxide n2o is an important greenhouse gas that has attracted increasing attention maaz et al 2021 wang et al 2021a shcherbak et al 2014 yang et al 2021 it plays a key role in global climate change due to its long residence in the troposphere and the role of stratospheric ozone depletion through photochemical processes ravishankara et al 2009 fiat et al 2019 the n2o potential greenhouse effect of a molecule is 298 times higher than that of co2 signor and cerri 2013 tian et al 2017 therefore it is very important to explore the influencing factors of n2o emissions for formulating emission reduction policies cropland soil is one of the most important sources contributing to the increase in n2o concentrations thompson et al 2019 accounting for approximately 25 of total global n2o emissions in nitrogen davidson and kanter 2014 reay et al 2012 soil microorganisms dominate denitrification with nitrate nitrogen no3 n as the reaction substrate and nitrification with ammonium nitrogen nh4 n as the reaction substrate and these processes are the most important ways to produce n2o in soil zhao et al 2020 temperature can affect the enzyme activity of microorganisms and influence the n2o emissions it has been reported that the activity of microorganisms in soil gradually increases with temperature duan et al 2019 koponen et al 2004 and soil moisture also influences the activity of microorganisms feng et al 2018 thus affecting nitrification and denitrification processes and the production of n2o in addition as the substrates for n2o production mainly come from the application of nitrogen fertilizer chen et al 2019 ren et al 2020 zhou et al 2018 the production of n2o will depend on the residence time of nitrogen fertilizer in cropland soils soil moisture is influenced by precipitation zhong et al 2018 in addition precipitation plays an important role in controlling the migration of nonpoint source nitrogen by influencing hydrological processes in watersheds perera et al 2015 wu et al 2012 if precipitation increases surface water yield will increase which results in an increase in total nitrogen tn loss from soils wang et al 2018b and a decrease in the residence time of nitrogen fertilizer in soils therefore the migration and transformation of nitrogen compounds and the production of n2o in soils will be influenced by climate factors including precipitation and temperature based on this deduction we hypothesized that changes in climate factors could influence n2o emissions by affecting the migration and transformation of nonpoint source nitrogen in soils to test this hypothesis and quantify the effect of climate factors on n2o emissions the swat soil and water assessment tool model wang et al 2018a 2016 was used to simulate the hydrologic process and the migration and transformation of nonpoint source nitrogen in addition as model simulation is an effective method used to study the temporal and spatial variation in n2o emissions at a watershed scale gao et al 2020 wagena et al 2017 zhou et al 2015 the swat n2o coupler which we developed previously by collecting 4488 measurements from around the world gao et al 2019 was modified to simulate the n2o emissions based on the output of soil nitrogen soil moisture and soil temperature from the swat model we selected the weihe upstream watershed a subbasin of the yellow river as the study area which was mainly composed of croplands with a proportion of 44 55 we used the swat model to simulate hydrologic processes climate conditions the migration and transformation of nonpoint source nitrogen at the same time we also used the modified swat n2o coupler to simulate n2o emissions from 2009 to 2018 based on this we also predicted the temperature precipitation and n2o emissions in the weihe upstream watershed from 2021 to 2080 under the context of climate change with three scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 rcp8 5 via this study we can learn to what extent that climate factors can affect n2o emissions through influencing nonpoint source nitrogen 2 materials and methods 2 1 mechanism concept and simulation about the effect of climate factors on n2o emissions from cropland soils climate factors can affect n2o emissions by influencing the migration and transformation of nonpoint source nitrogen in an agricultural watershed fig 1 after nonpoint source nitrogen is imported into the soil a series of biochemical processes will occur in the soil zhao et al 2020 climate factors can affect the migration and transformation of nonpoint source nitrogen by changing physical and chemical properties and hydrologic processes in soil wang et al 2019 which would affect n2o emissions these processes can be simulated by swat model the swat model is a semi distributed hydrological model that is mainly used to simulate cycles of nutrients and hydrology wang et al 2019 2020 the weather data topography data soil data land management data and land use data can be used to simulate the variation in soil temperature soil moisture and various forms of nitrogen in the soil and nitrogen concentration data in the river and sediment and flow data for the river can be used to calibrate and validate the model the swat n2o coupler was used to simulate the n2o emissions in this study gao et al 2019 the swat n2o coupler is a tool that can read the soil parameters soil nitrogen soil moisture and soil temperature output by the swat model for each hydrologic response unit hru and then export n2o emissions at the hru scale these functions were written in python and packaged on arcgis platforms as tools 2 2 the study area the weihe river is located on the loess plateau of china and is the largest tributary of the yellow river to eliminate the influence of industrial source nitrogen in the midstream and downstream the weihe upstream watershed was selected as the study area due to industrial underdevelopment cropland grassland and forest are the main land use types in the weihe upstream watershed and nonpoint source nitrogen in this area mainly comes from agriculture the topography of the weihe upstream watershed is high in the west and low in the east the geomorphologic types are mainly hills and gullies the weihe upstream watershed is located in a temperate monsoon climate zone with warm and rainy summers and cold and dry winters zhao et al 2019 precipitation is mainly concentrated in july october accounting for more than 60 of the annual precipitation zhou et al 2020 fig 2 because the formula in the swat n2o coupler was developed based on global data we modified it to fit the actual situation of the weihe upstream watershed this study modified the formula in the swat n2o coupler with our field observation data and literature data li et al 2018 sun et al 2018 xiao 2019 wang 2014 yan et al 2013 including 44 sets of soil n2o emissions g n ha 1 day 1 soil no3 n mg kg soil temperature c and soil moisture vol from six sampling sites the following is the modified formula 1 n 2 o s o i l 3 340 0 352 s n 0 080 s t 0 040 s w where n 2 o s o i l s n s t and s w are the soil n2o emissions g n ha 1 day 1 soil no3 n concentration mg kg soil temperature c and soil moisture vol respectively then we used the modified swat n2o coupler to simulate n2o emissions in the weihe upstream watershed 2 3 calibration and validation methods we used swat cup for calibration and validation and selected sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi2 as the calibration algorithm the performance of the swat model was evaluated by using the nash sutcliffe efficiency n s e and coefficient of determination r 2 as objective functions the following are the formulas for calculating n s e and r 2 2 n s e i 1 n r i r 2 i 1 n s i r i 2 i 1 n r i r 2 3 r 2 i 1 n r i r s i s 2 i 1 n r i r 2 i 1 n s i s 2 where r i is the i t h realistic value r is the mean value of

three climate scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 from 2021 to 2080 were obtained by using the regional climate model regcm4 4 the 25 km resolution climate change simulation was conducted by regcm4 4 driven by the cmip5 model of hadgem2 es gao et al 2017 han et al 2017 shi et al 2018 quantile delta mapping was further employed to correct the systematic biases cannon et al 2015 han et al 2019 tong et al 2021 when all the data were ready we first used the monthly nh3 n data in the river from january 2012 to october 2017 and the monthly flow and sediment data from january 2002 to december 2017 to calibrate and validate the swat model for stream flow and sediments the calibration period was from 2002 to 2012 and the validation period was from 2013 to 2017 for nh3 n the calibration period was from 2012 to 2015 and the validation period was from 2015 to 2017 then we used the modified swat n2o coupler to read soil nitrogen soil moisture and soil temperature data output from the swat model so that the daily data of n2o emissions from the weihe upstream watershed from 2009 to 2018 were obtained at the same time running the swat model we could obtain a large amount of daily climate hydrological and nonpoint source nitrogen data 2 5 data analysis we obtained daily n2o emissions temperature tmp precipitation prcp sediment yield sy water yield wy surface runoff sr nitrates taken by surface runoff ntsr total nitrates lost tnl including the nitrate taken by surface runoff soil runoff and groundwater runoff and total organic nitrogen lost tonl at the hru scale from 2009 to 2018 according to the method of area weighting the hru data were summarized for the subbasin and then averaged to obtain the daily average data of the subbasin 4 p j s u b m k i 1 n p j h r u i k a r e a h

the areas of h r u n and s u b m respectively in addition n is the number of hrus in s u b m then the daily data of the parameters of the subbasin were obtained by averaging the daily data over ten

to form the annual mean daily data for instance 7 p 0101 p 20090101 p 20100101 p 20180101 10 as there were few paddy fields in the study area urban areas had more hardened ground and the area was small we did not consider the n2o emissions of these land use types so we selected cropland forest and grassland for single factor anova the kolmogorov smirnov test was used to examine the normal distribution of environmental factors and n2o emissions for the non normally distributed variables we log transformed or exponentially transformed the data to compare the differences in n2o emissions between different land use types we used one way anova then we fitted the relationship between n2o emissions and environmental factors we also used stepwise regression analysis on related variables to examine multivariable relationships between n2o emissions and environmental factors all statistical analyzes used spss 19 0 software with a significance level of p 0 05 and origin 8 0 software was used to draw figures arcgis 10 4 was used to show the general situation of the study area and the spatial distribution of parameters python was used for data integration 3 results and discussions 3 1 calibration and validation of the swat model the n s e and r 2 values for stream flow and total sediment through river sections during calibration and validation periods were higher than 0 65 fig s1a and b which indicated that the simulations were good the n s e and r 2 values for the content of nh3 n in the river water during the calibration periods were 0 6 and 0 56 respectively and they were 0 85 and 0 63 during the validation periods respectively fig s1c such calibration and validation results showed that the model could be used to simulate the migration and transformation of nonpoint source pollution in the weihe upstream watershed 3 2 spatial variation in n2o emissions with land use types and subbasins using meteorological data from 2009 to 2018 as input to the model we obtained the data on daily n2o emissions and other related environmental factors in the weihe upstream watershed from 2009 to 2018 the n2o emissions from cropland 66 91 94 75 g ha 1 day 1 were significantly higher than those from grassland 17 66 7 05 g ha 1 day 1 forest 17 28 6 55 g ha 1 day 1 and unclassified land 0 83 0 34 g ha 1 day 1 fig s2 the n2o emissions showed great spatial variation which was mainly controlled by land use types figs 2 and s3 overall cropland was mainly located in the western and northeastern regions fig 2 which had high n2o emissions 3 81 5 58 g ha 1 day 1 the main land use types in the southeast and southwest regions were forestlands and grasslands fig 2 which had low n2o emissions 1 17 0 44 g ha 1 day 1 for the 20th subbasin and 21st subbasin although they had the same climatic and hydrological conditions fig s4 the n2o emissions of the 20th subbasin mainly covered by cropland were higher than those of the 21st subbasin mainly covered by forest figs 2 and s3 table s1 because the 20th subbasin received more fertilizer ren et al 2020 cropland in the west and northeast regions also caused the n2o emissions to be significantly higher than those in forestland and grassland located in the southeast and southwest regions figs 2 and s3 this result indicated that fertilization played a positive role in n2o emissions moreover temperature and precipitation could affect the spatial distribution of n2o emissions and the n2o emissions were at the highest levels in fig s3 only when temperatures and precipitation were within the appropriate range rather than when reaching the maximum figs s3 and s4 for instance for the 2nd 13th 14th 16th 23th and 28th subbasins the proportion of croplands in these subbasins reached 57 6 60 0 60 7 64 0 60 7 and 79 1 respectively and all of them were typical croplands table s1 although the precipitation in the 2nd 13th 14th 16th subbasins were lower than those of 23th and 28th subbasins the n2o emissions of the former were not only higher than the latter but also at the highest level among all the subbasins of the study area this was because the lower precipitation of the 2nd 13th 14th 16th subbasins led to the lower nitrogen loss which benefited the n2o emissions figs s3 and s4 3 3 temporal variation in environmental factors and n2o emissions in the model we set up the same fertilization measures for croplands in march may and june to simulate real management under the influence of peaked precipitation sediment yield water yield and surface runoff also peaked in summer especially in july for the whole weihe upstream watershed fig s5b d nitrates taken by surface runoff ntsr increased after three fertilizations to different degrees the nitrates taken by surface runoff for one month was 1 89 105 kg after the first fertilization for the whole weihe upstream watershed then it decreased to 1 53 105 kg 6 31 104 kg after the second and third fertilization respectively and it had a peak value again in july 8 38 104 kg fig s5e this may because permeability of soil was not good due to it was dry for a long time before march so it was easy to generated surface runoff and then took away the nitrate as soil moisture increased the soil permeability became better so a large amount of nitrate was lost by infiltration rather than surface runoff in july when precipitation was at the peak of the year the rain generated surface runoff before it seeped so the nitrates taken by surface runoff increased again however total nitrates lost tnl was highest after the second fertilization 1 59 106 kg and lowest after the first fertilization 2 89 105 kg in addition the total nitrates lost was still very high in july september and october without fertilizer application fig s5e the total organic nitrogen lost tonl was minimally affected by fertilization and its value peaked in july 2 56 106 kg and september 3 81 106 kg corresponding to the peak time of water yield fig s5e since total organic nitrogen lost contained dissolved organic nitrogen the value of it was not only related to sediment yield but also to water yield therefore although sediment yield in september was lower than in july total organic nitrogen lost was higher in september than in july because water yield in september 5 78 107 m3 was higher than that of july 4 73 107 m3 after each fertilization the n2o emissions increased dramatically and reached a peak then n2o emissions began to decrease and each range of decrease the proportion of the decrease from the highest value to the lowest value was different in three fertilizations the range of decrease in march 9 31 was significantly smaller than that in may 61 30 and june 52 19 and after june the n2o emissions continued to decline the peak values of n2o emissions after three fertilizations were different and the n2o emissions in march 3 81 g ha 1 day 1 were smaller than those in may 11 18 g ha 1 day 1 and june 12 95 g ha 1 day 1 fig s5 and the monthly n2o emissions in march 5 39 108 g were also lower than those in may 1 34 109 g and june 1 30 109 g for the whole weihe upstream watershed when the first fertilization applied in early march the n2o emissions increased dramatically after the peak n2o emissions they did not decrease significantly mainly because of the low total nitrates lost caused by the low precipitation in the weihe upstream watershed in march fig s5a only a tiny fraction of the nitrogen in the soil was washed into the river because of the low water yield fig s5c and e wang et al 2018b although the nitrates taken by surface runoff were higher than those in the later fertilization periods fig s5e it did not have much impact on the n2o emissions because of the lower total nitrates lost than those in the later fertilization periods fig s5e at this time nitrogen was relatively sufficient for microorganisms so there was only a slight decrease in n2o emissions when the second fertilization applied in early may the n2o emissions increased dramatically which was caused by the high temperature and sufficient moisture fig s5a c davidson and swank 1986 however after the peak n2o emissions a sharp decline occurred fig s5e it has been reported that ammonia in the soil volatilizes easily under higher temperatures duan et al 2019 koponen et al 2004 wang et al 2021b which limits nitrification and reduces n2o emissions in may the precipitation was significantly higher than that in march fig s5a and the increase in water yield resulting from high precipitation could cause nitrate loss in the soil fig s5a c and e zhang et al 2020 accelerating the decrease in n2o emissions moreover the value of total nitrates lost was very high in may fig s5e but the value of nitrates taken by surface runoff was relatively low fig s5e which indicated that more nitrates infiltrated into the deep soil were washed into the river by water flow than the amount after the first fertilization nitrates in deep soil might be more likely to produce n2o because of anaerobic conditions hu et al 2015 so the loss of this part of nitrates accelerates the decrease in n2o emissions when the third fertilization applied in early june the n2o emissions also increased dramatically under higher temperatures and precipitation fig s5a after the peak n2o emissions the n2o emissions continued to decrease until the next fertilization in the next year fig s5e during this period the loss of nitrogen still existed fig s5e which caused n2o emissions to decrease rapidly after increasing unlike the second fertilization the total organic nitrogen lost began to increase because of further increases in precipitation fig s5e in july and september the high values of total organic nitrogen lost and water yield indicated that the increase in water yield caused soil erosion lin et al 2020 fig s5c e because organic nitrogen is attached to sediments organic nitrogen can be washed into rivers with sediments as soil erosion occurs kiani et al 2018 during this period the dissolved nitrates converted by organic nitrogen also entered the river by the water flow fig s5e which accelerated the decrease in n2o emissions compared with march there were higher temperatures and precipitation in june which were beneficial to the production of n2o fig 3 however compared with may there were excessive temperatures and precipitation in june which created factors that were detrimental to the production of n2o thus the n2o emissions were lower than those in may fig 4 3 4 relationships between n2o emissions and climate as well as other environmental factors precipitation and n2o emissions r2 0 78 fig 3 as well as temperature and n2o emissions r2 0 80 fig 3 could be fitted to quadratic functions such functions told us that as precipitation increased the n2o emissions first increased and then decreased additionally as temperature increased the n2o emissions first increased and then the rate of increase decreased when the average monthly precipitation and average monthly temperature reached 78 8 mm and 23 0 c respectively then the n2o emissions began to decrease with precipitation and the rate of increase in n2o emissions was zero with temperature respectively for the hydrology a relationship between water yield and n2o emissions could be fitted to a power function r2 0 75 fig 5 b the relationships between surface runoff r2 0 73 fig 5a sediment yield r2 0 39 fig 5c and n2o emissions could be fitted to logarithmic functions they told us that as water yield surface runoff sediment yield increased the n2o emissions began to increase rapidly and then the degree of increase gradually weakened for the migration of nonpoint source nitrogen relationships between nitrate taken by surface runoff r2 0 45 fig 5d total nitrate lost r2 0 74 fig 5e total organic nitrogen lost r2 0 40 fig 5f and n2o emissions could be fitted to logarithmic functions this result told us that as nitrates taken by surface runoff total nitrates lost and total organic nitrogen lost increased n2o emissions began to increase rapidly and the degree of increase gradually declined stepwise regression analysis showed that standardized coefficients of related factors were sorted as sno3 stmp sprcp swy stnl this result reflected that no3 was the reaction substrate for n2o emissions and was the most important factor of n2o emissions the standardized coefficients of total nitrates lost and water yield were both negative because the increase of water yield will result in the increase of total nitrate lost and then the decrease of soil nitrate content which directly inhibited n2o emissions table s2 the contribution of temperature change to n2o emissions variation was higher than that of precipitation it could be concluded from the stepwise regression analysis that temperature played an important role in controlling n2o emissions and precipitation had complex effects on n2o emissions table s2 3 5 changes in n2o emissions in future climate scenarios to simulate n2o emissions using future climate data the following formula was acquired from a fitting of the n2o emissions data with the climate data of the weihe upstream watershed 8 ln n 2 o 3 0 04 lo g 10 prcp 0 85 ln tmp 5 0 83 r 2 0 70 the regional climate model regcm4 4 and three climate scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 were used to simulate the future climate between 2021 and 2080 the result showed that under three climate scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the global average temperature around 2080 rise by 1 85 2 98 and 4 56 c compared to before the industrial revolution then future climate data are used to bring in formula 8 to obtain future n2o emissions data in rcp2 6 the changes in temperature and precipitation are 0 043 c 10 y and 0 021 mm 10 y respectively fig s6a under rcp4 5 the changes in temperature and precipitation are 0 375 c 10 y and 0 002 mm 10 y respectively fig s6b under rcp8 5 the changes in temperature and precipitation are 0 704 c 10 y and 0 022 mm 10 y respectively fig s6c all of the changes of precipitation do not pass the significance test and the changes of temperature do not pass the significance test in rcp2 6 this result reflects that the increasing rates of temperature and precipitation are higher under higher intensity rcp scenarios as a result the changes in n2o emissions would be 0 010 g ha day 10 y 0 090 g ha day 10 y and 0 180 g ha day 10 y respectively and the enhancement would also be stronger under higher intensity rcp scenarios under the context of climate change with three scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 rcp8 5 the n2o emissions in the last decade 2071 2080 of predicted time period in the future would increase by 6 70 32 30 and 70 69 respectively compared with those in the first decade 2021 2030 of predicted time period in the future therefore the weihe upstream watershed should take corresponding reduction measures to control n2o emissions under future climate change in addition the weihe upstream watershed is located in the semi arid area the temperature will increase significantly but the precipitation will not increase significantly resulting in limited nitrogen loss in the future as a consequence n2o emissions will increase significantly in the future therefore this prediction results may be applicable to the climate area similar to the weihe upstream watershed in the future under climate change we found that temperature will be the main positive factor controlling n2o emissions compared with precipitation due to the complex effects of precipitation on the migration of nonpoint source pollutants at different times the effect of precipitation on n2o emissions is uncertain in the future it has been reported that the temperature in the weihe upstream watershed will increase in the future precipitation will decrease and the total extreme precipitation will also decrease zhou et al 2020 with the decrease in extreme precipitation the nitrogen washed into the river will decrease in a short period of time which will increase n2o emissions however if the reduced precipitation is concentrated in spring it is not conducive to n2o emissions therefore it is necessary to determine the seasonal variation in precipitation in the weihe upstream watershed to more precisely predict the effect of climate change on n2o emissions in the future in addition land use affects the migration of nonpoint source pollutants and land use changes over time wang et al 2018a therefore it is also necessary to explore how land use will affect n2o emissions by the migration of nonpoint source pollutants yan et al 2022 3 6 implications and limitations this research indicated that climate factors can affect n2o emissions by influencing the migration and transformation of nonpoint source nitrogen in an agricultural watershed fig 1 although field experimental research considered the effect of climate factors on n2o emissions gaihre et al 2014 rabot et al 2016 wu et al 2017 it did not analyze the change in n2o emissions from the aspect of the migration of nitrogen which was well compensated by our study in addition by means of a model rather than an experiment we could obtain long term daily data to give a more detailed characterization of temporal variations in n2o emissions moreover we established a formula for n2o emissions and climate parameters based on data from 2009 2018 and predicted n2o emissions based on future climate change scenarios from 2021 to 2080 however many results showed that microbial enzyme activity played an important role in n2o emissions duan et al 2019 koponen et al 2004 su et al 2019 nitrification and denitrification were essentially microbial driven and sometimes microbial enzyme activity played a decisive role on n2o emissions our model only considered soil temperature soil moisture and contents of nitrates so we should add microbial enzyme activity data to simulate n2o emissions more accurately in the future proper rainfall can increase soil moisture and promote n2o emissions the surface runoff generated by excessive rainfall can promote the entry of nonpoint source nitrogen into rivers wu et al 2012 but at the same time reduce n2o emissions from cultivated soil the entry of nonpoint source nitrogen into rivers and lakes will not only reduce the use efficiency of nitrogen fertilizer but also elevate the nitrogen concentration in waters affect the water quality and cause the eutrophication of lakes chen et al 2013 moreover the nitrogen compounds entering rivers and lakes will be transformed and release n2o liu et al 2013a 2013b therefore it is necessary to study the relationships among nitrogen fertilizer application greenhouse gas emissions and climate change at the watershed scale to provide a scientific basis for greenhouse gas emission reduction and agricultural management 4 conclusions the swat model and the modified swat n2o coupler were used to simulate the n2o emissions as well as the relevant environmental factors in the weihe upstream watershed different land uses could lead to different n2o emissions and the n2o emissions in cropland were the highest among different land use types temperature played an important role in controlling n2o emissions and precipitation had complex effects on n2o emissions the n2o emissions first increased and reached a plateau at 23 0 c and then the rate of increase decreased with temperature the n2o emissions was inhibited under excessive heating conditions probably because of the volatilization of ammonia the n2o emissions first increased rapidly with precipitation due to the increase in moisture which might have promoted microbial activity and created anoxic conditions however when the average monthly precipitation reached 78 8 mm the n2o emissions began to decrease because the residence time of nitrogen compounds in soil were reduced due to fast removal via runoff which inhibited n2o emissions in the future under the three scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 rcp8 5 higher temperature might lead to greater n2o emissions while insignificant changes in precipitation might have little effect on n2o emissions in the weihe upstream watershed credit authorship contribution statement jing huang conceptualization methodology writing original draft ruimin liu project

15608,microplastics are ubiquitous in estuaries coasts sewage and wastewater treatment plants wwtps which could arouse unexpected effects on critical microbial processes in wastewater treatment in this study polyethylene terephthalate microplastics pet mps were selected to investigate the mechanism of its influence on the performance of sulfur mediated biological process from the perspective of microbial metabolic activity electron transfer capacity and microbial community the results indicated that the exposure of 50 particles l pet mps improved the chemical oxygen demand cod and sulfate removal efficiencies by 6 6 0 5 and 4 5 0 3 respectively due to the stimulation of microbial metabolic activity and the enrichment of sulfate reducing bacteria srb species such as desulfobacter in addition we found that the pet mps promoted cytochrome c cyt c production and improved the direct electron transfer det capacity mediated by cyt c the long term presence of pet mps stimulated the secretion of extracellular polymeric substance eps especially the proteins and humic substances which have been verified to be electroactive polymers to act as electron shuttles to promote the interspecies electron transfer pathway in sulfur mediated biological process meanwhile the transformation products bis 2 hydroxyethyl terephthalate bhet and mono 2 hydroxyethyl terephthalic acid mhet of pet mps were detected in sulfur mediated biological process these findings indicate that the sulfur mediated biological process has good adaptability to the toxicity of pet mps which strengthens a deeper understanding of the dual function of microplastics in wwtps graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords polyethylene terephthalate microplastics pet mps sulfur mediated biological process microbial metabolic activity electron transfer capacity microbial community data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction microplastics which are generally defined as synthetic organic polymers less than 5 mm in size have been manufactured as basic constituents for commercial and industrial use such as detergents cosmetics textiles paints pharmaceutical and personal care products wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 polyethylene terephthalate microplastics pet mps is a polymer composed of ethylene glycol and terephthalic acid monomers according to report the annual consumption of pet mps exceeds 300 million tons making up about 13 of the world s total plastic production geyer et al 2017 laldinpuii et al 2021 as the countless application of microplastics a growing number of microplastics inevitably enter the environment media such as terrestrial environments sediments surface water wastewater atmosphere and especially marine and coastal environments cole et al 2011 zhang et al 2020 recent reports indicated that approximately 8 million tons of microplastics are released into the ocean every year guo and wang 2019 due to the extremely small size high stability mobility and bioavailability of microplastics and could be easily ingested by many kinds of organisms they posed a toxic threat to the ecosystems guo and wang 2019 meanwhile with growing population and serious pollutant of water resources water shortage is becoming a crucially matter attracting global attention oki and kanae 2006 vorosmarty et al 2000 some coastal cities such as hong kong have been using seawater to flush toilets for decades due to water stress wsd 2010 studies reported that a large number of plastic microbeads has been detected in hong kong coastal waters among which pet mps was the dominant microplastics polymer so et al 2018 xu et al 2022b as a result large amounts of microplastics from seawater and coastal environments would enter wastewater treatment plants wwtps through seawater toilet flushing jambeck et al 2015 xu et al 2022b currently a novel sulfur mediated biological process sulfate reduction autotrophic denitrification nitrification integrated sani has been developed and applied in wwtps in hong kong for treatment of saline wastewater lu et al 2012 wu et al 2016 the application of sulfur mediated biological process provides an energy saving possibility for biological treatment of sulfur containing saline wastewaters hao et al 2014 lu et al 2012 for example sani integrated simultaneous desulfurization and denitrification and denitrifying sulfur assisted enhanced biological phosphorous removal processes chen et al 2014 lu et al 2012 wu et al 2016 therefore it is of great significance to study the effects of microplastics on sulfur mediated biological process for the disposal of sulfur containing municipal and industrial wastewaters the wwtps are considered to be an important sink of the microplastics and the ultimate barriers to microplastics entering the natural environment murphy et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 recently several studies have showed that microplastics may adversely affect the critical microbial processes in wastewater treatment including decreased the enzymes activity and inhibited the functional microorganism such as methanogens and denitrification microorganisms wei et al 2020 zhou et al 2022 however the study from seeley et al 2020 demonstrated that microplastics can act as organic carbon substrates for microorganism and significantly affect the nitrogen cycling process in sediments in addition chen et al 2021 also found that the polyamide 6 microplastics facilitated methane production via improving key enzyme activities therefore the microplastics may play a dual role in wwtps depending on the types of microplastics and microbial species however to our knowledge no studies have been reported on the effects of microplastics on sulfur mediated biological process extracellular electron transfer and oxidation reduction reactions are essential for the exchange of substances and energy between microbial cells and the external environment and play a vital role in microbial dissimilation shi et al 2016 and transformation of organic pollutants pearce et al 2006 zhang and katayama 2012 zhou et al 2020 two mechanistically overarching extracellular electron transfer pathways have been proposed i contact dependent direct transfer occurs through conductive nanowires pili or redox substances such as proteins located in the outer membrane of microorganisms e g cytochrome c cyt c and ii indirect transfer occurs via dissolved redox active electron shuttling mediators secreted by microorganisms e g redox proteins flavins and quinones light et al 2018 marsili et al 2008 newman and kolter 2000 or some natural substances such as humic quinones xiao et al 2017 zhou et al 2020 extracellular polymeric substance eps are macromolecular polymers produced by microorganisms mainly consist of polysaccharides proteins and humic acids which can act as electron shuttles for microbial mediated extracellular electron transfer he et al 2020 li et al 2019b ye et al 2018 until now however there still lacks of deep exploration of the influence mechanisms of microplastics on wastewater biological treatment process from biological and biochemical electron transfer behaviors thus this study aims to reveal the long term effects of pet mps on microorganisms in sulfur mediated biological process in terms of performance microbial metabolic activity adenosine triphosphoric acid atp dehydrogenase dha live dead cell ratio and microbial community in addition the effect mechanism of pet mps on the electron transfer process in sulfur mediated biological process was disclosed via evaluating the variations and the electron transfer capacity of eps and cyt c which have the ability to mediate electron transfer the findings of this study provide the first comprehensive understanding of the influence mechanisms of pet mps to sulfur mediated biological systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 system setup and operating conditions pet mps with an average size of 1 mm were purchased from macklin biochemical co ltd shanghai china and used as a model microplastic to explore its influence on sulfur mediated biological process in this study a laboratory scale sulfate reducing up flow sludge bed srusb reactor 5 6 l see fig s1 in supplementary information si was established and run continuously for 120 days at different pet mps conditions in the first 40 days the srusb was fed with synthetic wastewater with no pet mps as a control stage stage i see table s1 in si for composition then the srusb reactor was continuously operated for another 80 days at pet mps concentration of 50 particles l in influent as experiment stage stage ii the pet mps concentration 50 particles l and size 1 mm examined in this

aerobic activated sludge was collected from the secondary sedimentation tank of a local wastewater treatment plant traditional activated sludge process in guangzhou china the srb enriched sludge was obtained from the anaerobic bioreactor of the sani process in our laboratory that has been operating for more than four years the average volatile suspended solids vss concentration in the srusb bioreactor was maintained at 10 4 0 5 g l and the ratio of vss suspended solids ss was about 0 65 0 03 the hydraulic retention time hrt of the bioreactor was set to 6 h the concentrations of sulfate dissolved sulfide and chemical oxygen demand cod of the influent and effluent samples collected from the srusb bioreactor daily were analyzed following the standard methods apha 2005 the cod and dissolved sulfide concentrations in the samples were measured immediately after sample collection the actual cod value was determined by subtracting the theoretical cod value consumed by sulfide i e twice of the sulfide content from the measured cod value the possible transformation products of pet mps in effluent of sulfur mediated process were examined by an ultra performance liquid chromatography uplc according to the literature gong et al 2018 2 2 metabolic activity and viability of microbiota several analytical tests were conducted to investigate the stress response of sulfur mediated biological process to pet mps from the perspective of the microbial metabolic activity and viability the staining of live and dead cells in microbiota of sulfur mediated sludge was measured using the live dead baclight bacterial viability kits molecular probes l 7012 xu et al 2018 to examine the viability of microbiota in sulfur mediated sludge under pet mps stress more details can be found in page s3 in si atp is a multifunctional nucleotide used as a coenzyme in cells which plays a pivotal role in intracellular energy transfer and cell metabolism knowles 1980 therefore can be a useful indicator of microbial activity in this study the atp concentration was examined using the molecular probes atp determination kit a22066 thermofisher scientific america dha is a class of enzymes that catalyzes redox reactions of substances such as carbohydrates amino acids and organic acids the dha activity was determined by quantifying the amount of the reduced form of 2 3 5 triphenyltetrazoilum chloride ttc to indicate the total oxidative potential of microbiota in sulfur mediated sludge under pet mps stress xie et al 2009 more information about the dha measurement is described in the pages s3 s4 in si 2 3 cyt c content cyt c is an electron transfer protein on bacteria outer membrane and plays a crucial role in the process of extracellular electron transfer li et al 2019a in this study the cyt c content was examined to indicate the extracellular electron transfer efficiency of microorganism under pet mps exposure the extraction method of cyt c is according to the literature li et al 2019a more details of the cyt c extraction and detection were found in pages s4 s5 in si the cyt c concentrations of the biomass samples were determined by double antibody sandwich enzyme linked immunosorbent assay with the microbiological elisa kit feiya biotechnology jiangsu china 2 4 eps extraction and analyses eps is a macromolecular polymer secreted by microorganisms which is beneficial to the transformation of organic micropollutants and the maintenance of system stability in biological wastewater treatment systems zhang et al 2018 thus the content and compositions variation of eps extracted from sludge samples were characterized to reveal the stress responses of microorganisms to pet mps in srusb bioreactor eps of sludge samples were extracted as per the modified heat extraction method more details about the eps extraction is described in the page s5 in si li and yang 2007 the concentrations of polysaccharide ps protein pn and humic acid ha in eps were determined by the phenol sulfuric acid method modified lowry method and anthrone method respectively frolund et al 1995 wang et al 2015 the three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem fluorescence spectra of eps was detected following the 3d eem fluorescence spectroscopy more details are presented in page s5 in si zhang et al 2019 2 5 microbial community analysis biomass samples were obtained from the srusb reactor on days 40 and 120 for microbial community analysis which was conducted using polymerase chain reaction pcr amplification and 16s rrna gene targeted high throughput illumina sequencing the powersoil dna isolation kit mobio ca usa was used to extract the dna of each sample by following the manufacture s instruction all the dna samples were amplified by pcr using the primers set 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 and 338f 5 actcctacgggaggcagcag 3 targeting the v3 v4 regions of the bacterial 16s rrna gene xu et al 2016 and then the pcr products were sequenced by illumina miseq platform illumina inc san diego ca usa 2 6 electrochemical analysis electrochemical experiments were conducted with the chi electrochemical workstation chi660e chenhua shanghai china and a conventional three electrode cell which consists of a platinum wire counter electrode a glassy carbon working electrode 5 mm in diameter and an ag agcl reference electrode all aqueous solutions used in electrochemical analysis were purged with nitrogen for 30 mins at room temperature to ensure anoxic conditions potentials were measured against ag agcl reference electrode but are reported with reference to the standard hydrogen electrode she in this study all the electrochemical experiments of each sample were conducted in triplicate 2 6 1 direct electrochemical transfer the direct electron transfer det capacity of cyt c and eps was measured by the chronoamperometry methods according to the literature det was performed at e 0 59 v aeschbacher et al 2010 the detailed process as follows 8 ml of buffer 0 1 m pbs ph 7 0 was filled in the electrochemical cell and the electrode was balanced to the desired potentials e 0 59 v then 1 ml eps cyt c samples were added into the cell to record the current response over time the number of electrons transferred q μmol e was measured according to eq 1 i e reduction or oxidation current i integral over time t s 1 q 1 f t 1 t 2 idt where q μmol e refers to the number of electrons transferred f is the faraday constant 96 485 c mol e i c s is the current and t s is time 2 6 2 electrochemical reduction and oxidation mediated by eps the electron exchange capacity of eps extracted from the sludge which comprises the electron donating capacity qedc and electron accepting capacity qeac were obtained by using the chronoamperometry methods the experimental details of mediated electrochemical reduction mer and mediated electrochemical oxidation meo measurement were referred to the literature gorski et al 2012 first 8 ml of buffer 0 1 m pbs ph 7 0 was injected into the electrochemical cell to balance the electrode to the desired potentials i e e 0 49 v in mer and e 0 61 v in meo respectively then the electron transfer mediators 2 2 azinobis 3 ethylbenzthiazoline 6 sulfonic acid ammonium salt abts 10 mm in meo and diquat dibromide monohydrate dq 10 mm in mer were added into the electrochemical cell thereby generating oxidative and reductive currents respectively after regaining the background currents 1 ml eps samples were injected to the cells and record the current response over time the qeac and qedc of eps were calculated by integrating the current peak response according to eqs 2 and 3 2 q eac 1 f t 1 t 2 i red dt vss 3 q edc 1 f t 1 t 2 i ox dt vss where qeac and qedc were the amounts of electrons in eps per gram of vss sludge μmol e g vss 2 7 statistical analyses in this study all samples were analyzed in triplicate and the results were expressed as mean standard deviation statistical analyses were carried out to examine the significant difference statistically in data obtained from the two stages of reactor operation multiple comparisons were performed using one way analysis of variance anova with the least significant difference lsd below 0 05 p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of sulfur mediated biological process the performance of sulfur mediated biological process under the exposure of pet mps was evaluated based the cod removal and sulfate conversion as shown in fig 1 the cod removal and sulfate conversion efficiencies were 79 58 1 1 and 59 7 0 6 in stage i without pet mps and 86 2 1 3 and 64 2 0 9 in stage ii with 50 particles l of pet mps in influent respectively compared with microplastics inhibiting the nitrogen removal in activated sludge system he et al 2021 qin et al 2020 and methane production in anaerobic methanogenic sludge system wei et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 the presence of pet mps has no significantly negative effect on sulfur mediated biological process conversely the cod removal and sulfate converse efficiencies was improved by 6 6 0 5 and 4 5 0 3 respectively in the presence of pet mps the results indicated that the addition of pet mps has no inhibitory effect on sulfur mediated biological process reflecting the good adaptability of the sulfur mediated biological process to toxic substances such as microplastics the improvement of cod removal and sulfate reduction may owe to the enrichment of srb species evidenced by the higher relative abundance of srb species under pet mps exposure in sulfur mediated biological process fig 3 a almost all the reduced sulfate was converted to dissolved sulfide achieving a sulfur mass balance of 93 5 2 7 in srusb reactor previous studies have also demonstrated that sulfur mediated biological process is tolerant to pharmaceuticals jia et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 but this is the first study to investigate the response of sulfur mediated biological process on microplastics 3 2 microbial metabolic activity and community structure 3 2 1 microbial metabolic activity to determine the effects of pet mps on the viability and microbial metabolic activity of microbiota in sulfur mediated biological process the live dead cells distribution atp level and dha activity of biomass samples from srusb reactor were examined as shown in fig 2 a the results of live dead staining assay showed that the percentage of the live cells were 93 7 in stage i without pet mps addition and 94 0 in stage ii with 50 particles l of pet mps in influent obviously the presence of pet mps had no significant impact on the viability of microbiota in sulfur mediated biological process indicating the high adaptability of srb enriched sludge to pet mps in comparison the anaerobic fermentation process of waste activated sludge was susceptible to microplastics and the percentage of the dead cells increased significantly from 17 0 1 1 to 28 9 1 9 with increasing pet mps concentration from 10 to 60 particles g ts wei et al 2019 atp as an indicator of microbial activity increased correspondingly from 158 6 0 7 nmol g vss stage i to 297 2 2 5 nmol g vss stage ii fig 2 b in addition the dha activity increased significantly from 92 4 0 9 mg g vss in control stage i to 131 5 1 6 mg g vss in stage ii after long term exposure to 50 particles l of pet mps in influent fig 2 c atp as an activated energy carrier dha as the key enzymes involved in various biological oxidative activities they all play crucial roles in organic compounds degradation and microbial metabolism chen et al 2018 wang et al 2016 the increase of atp level and dha activity confirmed that the pet mps stimulated the microbial activity and improved the metabolic adaptation of microbiota in sulfur mediated biological process yang et al 2002 which well explained the excellent performance of sulfur mediated biological process this may be due to the fact that microplastics can be used as organic carbon substances for microorganisms to promote microbial metabolism seeley et al 2020 study reported that polylactic acid and polyurethane foam amended sediments promote nitrification and denitrification seeley et al 2020 other study also found that the presence of microplastics enhanced genes involved in cofactors and vitamin metabolism signal transduction cell motility and glycan biosynthesis and metabolism in aerobic granular sludge system zhao et al 2020 the study of chen et al 2021 also demonstrated that the polyamide 6 microplastics increased methane production due to the leachate caprolactam promoted the key enzymes activities 3 2 2 microbial community the microbial community of sulfur mediated biological process under different pet mps pressures were analyzed and the results are recorded in fig 3 as shown in fig 3 a the genera desulfobacter methanomethylovorans and mycobacteroides were the most abundant bacterial populations in sulfur mediated biological process accounting for 21 1 0 5 and 18 1 0 6 of the total bacterial community in stage i and stage ii respectively however long term exposure to sulfate and pet mps under anaerobic condition reduced the relative abundance of mycobacteroides a strictly aerobic genus griffith 2009 and methanogens methanomethylovorans hu et al 2018 but enriched the genera desulfobacter desulfuromonas and desulfomonile these srb species have been documented to have ability of reducing sulfate and biodegrading organic substances muyzer and stams 2008 rabus et al 2006 which was in accord with the excellent performance of sulfate reduction and cod removal in srusb reactor fig 1 it has been confirmed that microplastics such as polyhydroxyalkanoate pha can be degraded by sewage sludge through hydrolysis acetogenesis and methanogenesis under different redox conditions such as sulfate reduction ma et al 2022 pinnell et al 2019 also found that the biofilm can be formed on large microplastics with a diameter of 3 4 mm at the sediment water interface and the polyhydroxyalkanoate microplastics can promote the growth of srb in addition studies found that most genera of desulfobacteraceae and desulfobulbaceae are dominant genera with a high relative abundance under polyvinyl chloride exposure in marsh sediment seeley et al 2020 these results suggested that srb has good adaptability and degradation potential to microplastics moreover the relative abundance of electroactive bacteria geobacter increased from 1 2 0 1 to 1 9 0 1 under pet mps exposure studies reported that abundant extracellular cyt c are the primary functional eps components of electroactive bacteria liu et al 2018 shi et al 2009 steidl et al 2016 therefore the result may be linked to the higher content and electron transfer capacity of cyt c under pet mps exposure figs 4 a and 5 b it is apparent that the chronic exposure of pet mps increased the relative abundances of key srb species and electroactive bacteria in addition the shift of the srb genera in sulfur mediated biological process was detected in this study the changes in genera of srb during long time exposure to pet mps can be divided into two groups as shown in fig 3 b group 1 including desulfococcus syntrophobacter desulfobacca and other 11 srb genera obviously decreased after addition of 50 particles l of pet mps in influent conversely the desulfobacter desulfuromonas desulfomonile and other 13 srb genera in group 2 increased significantly accounting for 75 2 and 85 7 of the total detected srb genera in stage i and stage ii respectively these results suggested that the selective pressure of pet mps induced the shift of srb microbial community from group 1 to group 2 desulfobacter dominated genera and the desulfobacter dominated microbiota in group 2 is more adaptable to pet mps than srb genera in group 1 further we calculated the relative abundance of total srb genera the srb genera in total genera in sludge samples from two stages in srusb reactor apparently the relative abundance of srb genera increased significantly from 13 1 stage i pet mps 0 particles l in influent to 16 5 stage ii pet mps 50 particles l in influent p 0 05 it may be due to the pet mps was used as organic carbon substance for srb growth in sulfur mediated process the transformation products of pet mps bis 2 hydroxyethyl terephthalate bhet and mono 2 hydroxyethyl terephthalic acid mhet were also detected in the effluent of sulfur mediated process see fig s2 in si in addition previous studies have also reported that microplastics can act as organic carbon source to facilitate the growth of srb ma et al 2022 pinnell and turner 2019 seeley et al 2020 for example a novel bacterium strain ideonella sakaiensis isolated from sediment which is able to use pet as its major energy and carbon source and convert pet into its two environmentally benign monomers mhet and terephthalic acid tpa yoshida et al 2016 gong et al 2018 confirmed that pet derived mps can act as sole substrate for bacteria and produce bhet mhet tpa and methyl acrylate ma through biodegradation and hydrolysis moreover torena et al 2021 reported that pet mps can serve as a carrier for biofilm forming and facilitates the growth of microorganisms these results of the microbial community of sulfur mediated biological sludge strongly supported the improved cod removal and sulfate conversion efficiencies in section 3 1 the degradation of pet mps may be contributed to the srb metabolism and this hypothesis should be confirmed in future studies 3 3 electron transfer process in sulfur mediated biological process 3 3 1 characterization of electroactive substances cyt c and eps the removal and conversion of pollutants in biological sludge system are significantly correlated with the extracellular electron transfer and oxidation reduction reactions between microorganisms he et al 2020 li et al 2017 2019b su et al 2019 the redox complexes cyt c as one of electron mediators plays a key role in direct interspecies electron transfer kumar et al 2016 shi et al 2016 moreover eps has been demonstrated to be electroactive and can act as electron shuttles to enhance the interspecies electron transfer in biological sludge systems he et al 2020 li et al 2019b therefore the electroactive substances cyt c and eps were examined to indicate the electron transfer activity of sulfur mediated biological process under pet mps stress as shown in fig 4 a the presence of pet mps significantly stimulated the cyt c production the content of cyt c was 17 83 0 4 nmol g vss in stage ii which was significantly higher than that in stage i 11 6 0 2 nmol g vss cyt c located in pili and the outer membrane of microorganisms mediates extracellular electron transfer and has been proved to be involved in transformation of pollutants cai et al 2012 xu et al 2022a thus the higher content of cyt c signified higher efficiency of det and redox reactions in sulfur mediated biological process under pet mps exposure it was due to the enrichment of the electroactive microorganisms such as geobacter shewanella and rhodoferax under pet mps exposure study demonstrated that abundant cyt c exists in the extracellular membrane of electroactive microorganism shi et al 2007 eps an indispensable part of biological sludge is composed of polymers secreted by microorganisms and involved in most extracellular metabolic pathways sheng et al 2010 tang et al 2020 changes in eps structure and composition of sludge samples from sulfur mediated biological process under pet mps exposure were examined as shown in fig 4 b the proteins polysaccharides and humic acid are the main components in eps long term exposure to pet mps at 50 particles l significantly increased eps secretion especially proteins and humic acid increased by 5 1 and 37 6 respectively such increases suggested that more eps was secreted to defend the microbiota from the toxicity of pet mps sheng et al 2010 zhang et al 2019 this finding was consistent with the previous study which demonstrated that polyethylene microplastics improved the microbial activity in natural surface water increased the production of eps and formed biofilm on the surface of microplastic particles xiong et al 2021 studies demonstrated that the redox active proteins humic acid and fulvic acid in eps can mediate the extracellular electron transfer between electroactive bacteria or other microorganisms and thereby influence the pollutants removal he et al 2020 li et al 2019b therefore the increase of eps content indicated that pet mps stimulates the microbial activity and improves the det efficiency in sulfur mediated biological process furthermore the changes of the fluorescence components in eps after exposure to pet mps were examined and presented in fig 4 c apparently there are five major fluorescence peaks in eps peak a ex em 290 340 365 nm were assigned to tryptophan protein like compounds chen et al 2003 peak b ex em 340 380 495 530 nm and peak c ex em 420 480 500 540 nm was assigned to humic like fractions chen et al 2003 in stage ii peak d ex em 260 280 405 450 nm and peak e ex em 300 350 405 450 nm which was identified as fulvic acid like and humic like substances chen et al 2003 appeared in eps after exposure to pet mps the fluorescence intensity of eps was enhanced with the addition of pet mps which is consistent with the results that the eps content especially humic acid increased remarkably under pet mps exposure in sulfur mediated biological process fig 4 b these results suggested that the addition of pet mps is indeed beneficial to the electron transfer in sulfur mediated biological process in order to explore the effect of pet mps on electron transfer efficiency in sulfur mediated biological process the electron transfer capacity of cyt c and eps was quantitatively detected as discussed in the following section 3 3 2 the det capacity of cyt c and eps the det capacity of cyt c and eps in sulfur mediated biological process under pet mps exposure was examined via chronoamperometry gorski et al 2012 as shown in fig 5 a the current increased after the addition of cyt c result in a current peak and then kept decreasing until it returned to the background current it indicated that det occurs between the working electrode and the cyt c gorski et al 2012 apparently the current responses of cyt c in stage ii were greater than that in stage i which was consistent with the results in fig 4 a that the cyt c concentration at stage ii was significantly higher than that of stage i in addition we calculated the det capacity of cyt c via integrating the current peak response ye et al 2018 as shown in fig 5 b the det capacity of cyt c is 18 06 0 4 μmol e μmol cyt c in stage i which is significantly lower than that in stage ii 30 9 0 6 μmol e μmol cyt c the results indicated that the pet mps improved the det capacity of cyt c similar experiments were performed to quantify the det capacity of eps as shown in fig 5 c the addition of eps result in current response demonstrating that eps can mediate det it was due to redox active proteins in eps have the same function as cyt c which has been proved to mediate the det yang et al 2019 ye et al 2018 in addition the similar results were found in eps where the current responses and det capacity of eps in stage ii 0 237 0 014 μmol e g vss were significantly higher than those in stage i 0 031 0 001 μmol e g vss apparently the contribution of cyt c and eps to electron transfer capacity in stage ii was greater than that in stage i these results suggested that the pet mps improved the det capacity of cyt c and eps which favor pollutants removal in sulfur mediated biological process 3 3 3 the indirect electron transfer capacity of eps the qeac qedc and total electron exchanging capacity qtotal qedc qeac of eps were measured via chronoamperometry li et al 2019b and the results showed that the eps is capable of electron transfer as shown in fig 6 in the presence of dq the addition of eps caused a reductive current peak fig 6 a suggesting that dq mediate electron transfer from the working electrode to the eps the addition of abts caused an oxidative peak of eps in fig 6 b demonstrating that abts mediate electron transfer from the eps to the working electrode the qeac and qedc of eps were obtained by integrating the reductive current peak and oxidative current peak response respectively li et al 2019b as shown in fig 6 c the qtotal of eps was mainly attributed by qeac and increased significantly after 50 particles l pet mps addition reaching 2 97 0 12 μmol e g vss in stage ii it was attributed to the higher eps especially proteins humic acid and fulvic acid contents in stage ii than that in stage i fig 4 b it has been reported that the qedc and qeac of eps are positively correlated with their protein concentrations yang et al 2019 the qedc and qeac of eps also had a positive correlation with the proteins content in eps of methanogenic communities ye et al 2018 apparently pet mps enhances electron transfer capacity accelerates the electron transfer during the sulfate reduction anaerobically and cod removal and promotes the pollutants removal however almost no qedc was detected in all operation stages indicating the electron donating capacity of eps is low in sulfur mediated biological process 4 conclusions the performance and electron transfer of sulfur mediated biological processes were enhanced significantly under pet mps exposure the cod removal efficiency and sulfate reduction efficiency improved by 6 6 0 5 and 4 5 0 3 respectively after long term pet mps 50 particles l exposure in srusb reactor the presence of pet mps stimulated microbial metabolic activity increased the secretion of cyt c and eps and enhanced the electron transfer capacity of cyt c and eps in sulfur mediated biological process in addition microbial community analysis showed an increase in critical srb species e g desulfobacter and electroactive bacteria e g geobacter following long term exposure to pet mps which well supported the excellent performance of srusb reactor meanwhile the transformation products bhet and mhet of pet were detected in sulfur mediated biological process the findings

15608,microplastics are ubiquitous in estuaries coasts sewage and wastewater treatment plants wwtps which could arouse unexpected effects on critical microbial processes in wastewater treatment in this study polyethylene terephthalate microplastics pet mps were selected to investigate the mechanism of its influence on the performance of sulfur mediated biological process from the perspective of microbial metabolic activity electron transfer capacity and microbial community the results indicated that the exposure of 50 particles l pet mps improved the chemical oxygen demand cod and sulfate removal efficiencies by 6 6 0 5 and 4 5 0 3 respectively due to the stimulation of microbial metabolic activity and the enrichment of sulfate reducing bacteria srb species such as desulfobacter in addition we found that the pet mps promoted cytochrome c cyt c production and improved the direct electron transfer det capacity mediated by cyt c the long term presence of pet mps stimulated the secretion of extracellular polymeric substance eps especially the proteins and humic substances which have been verified to be electroactive polymers to act as electron shuttles to promote the interspecies electron transfer pathway in sulfur mediated biological process meanwhile the transformation products bis 2 hydroxyethyl terephthalate bhet and mono 2 hydroxyethyl terephthalic acid mhet of pet mps were detected in sulfur mediated biological process these findings indicate that the sulfur mediated biological process has good adaptability to the toxicity of pet mps which strengthens a deeper understanding of the dual function of microplastics in wwtps graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords polyethylene terephthalate microplastics pet mps sulfur mediated biological

defined as synthetic organic polymers less than 5 mm in size have been manufactured as basic constituents for commercial and industrial use such as detergents cosmetics textiles paints pharmaceutical and personal care products wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 polyethylene terephthalate microplastics pet mps is a polymer composed of ethylene glycol and terephthalic acid monomers according to report the annual consumption of pet mps exceeds 300 million tons making up about 13 of the world s total plastic production geyer et al 2017 laldinpuii et al 2021 as the countless application of microplastics a growing number of microplastics inevitably enter the environment media such as terrestrial environments sediments surface water wastewater atmosphere and especially marine and coastal environments cole et al 2011 zhang et al 2020 recent reports indicated that approximately 8 million tons of microplastics are released into the ocean every year guo and wang 2019 due to the extremely small size high stability mobility and bioavailability of microplastics and could be easily ingested by many kinds of organisms they posed a toxic threat to the ecosystems guo and wang 2019 meanwhile with growing population and serious pollutant of water resources water shortage is becoming a crucially matter attracting global attention oki and kanae 2006 vorosmarty et al 2000 some coastal cities such as hong kong have been using seawater to flush toilets for decades due to water stress wsd 2010 studies reported that a large number of plastic microbeads has been detected in hong kong coastal waters among which pet mps was the dominant microplastics polymer so et al 2018 xu et al 2022b as a result large amounts of microplastics from seawater and coastal environments would enter wastewater treatment plants wwtps through seawater toilet flushing jambeck et al 2015 xu et al 2022b currently a novel sulfur mediated biological process sulfate reduction autotrophic denitrification nitrification integrated sani has been developed and applied in wwtps in hong kong for treatment of saline wastewater lu et al 2012 wu et al 2016 the application of sulfur mediated biological process provides an energy saving possibility for biological treatment of sulfur containing saline wastewaters hao et al 2014 lu et al 2012 for example sani integrated simultaneous desulfurization and denitrification and denitrifying sulfur assisted enhanced biological phosphorous removal processes chen et al 2014 lu et al 2012 wu et al 2016 therefore it is of great significance to study the effects of microplastics on sulfur mediated biological process for the disposal of sulfur containing municipal and industrial wastewaters the wwtps are considered to be an important sink of the microplastics and the ultimate barriers to microplastics entering the natural environment murphy et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 recently several studies have showed that microplastics may adversely affect the critical microbial processes in wastewater treatment including decreased the enzymes activity and inhibited the functional microorganism such as methanogens and denitrification microorganisms wei et al 2020 zhou et al 2022 however the study from seeley et al 2020 demonstrated that microplastics can act as organic carbon substrates for microorganism and significantly affect the nitrogen cycling process in sediments in addition chen et al 2021 also found that the polyamide 6 microplastics facilitated methane production via improving key enzyme activities therefore the microplastics may play a dual role in wwtps depending on the types of microplastics and microbial species however to our knowledge no studies have been reported on the effects of microplastics on sulfur mediated biological process extracellular electron transfer and oxidation reduction reactions are essential for the exchange of substances and energy between microbial cells and the external environment and play a vital role in microbial dissimilation shi et al 2016 and transformation of organic pollutants pearce et al 2006 zhang and katayama 2012 zhou et al 2020 two mechanistically overarching extracellular electron transfer pathways have been proposed i contact dependent direct transfer occurs through conductive nanowires pili or redox substances such as proteins located in the outer membrane of microorganisms e g cytochrome c cyt c and ii indirect transfer occurs via dissolved redox active electron shuttling mediators secreted by microorganisms e g redox proteins flavins and quinones light et al 2018 marsili et al 2008 newman and kolter 2000 or some natural substances such as humic quinones xiao et al 2017 zhou et al 2020 extracellular polymeric substance eps are macromolecular polymers produced by microorganisms mainly consist of polysaccharides proteins and humic acids which can act as electron shuttles for microbial mediated extracellular electron transfer he et al 2020 li et al 2019b ye et al 2018 until now however there still lacks of deep exploration of the influence mechanisms of microplastics on wastewater biological treatment process from biological and biochemical electron transfer behaviors thus this study aims to reveal the long term effects of pet mps on microorganisms in sulfur mediated biological process in terms of performance microbial metabolic activity adenosine triphosphoric acid atp dehydrogenase dha live dead cell ratio and microbial community in addition the effect mechanism of pet mps on the electron transfer process in sulfur mediated biological process was disclosed via evaluating the variations and the electron transfer capacity of eps and cyt c which have the ability to mediate electron transfer the findings of this study provide the first comprehensive understanding of the influence mechanisms of pet mps to sulfur mediated biological systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 system setup and operating conditions pet mps with an average size of 1 mm were purchased from macklin biochemical co ltd shanghai china and used as a model microplastic to explore its influence on sulfur mediated biological process in this study a laboratory scale sulfate reducing up flow sludge bed srusb reactor 5 6 l see fig s1 in supplementary information si was established and run continuously for 120 days at different pet mps conditions in the first 40 days the srusb was fed with synthetic wastewater with no pet mps as a control stage stage i see table s1 in si for composition then the srusb reactor was continuously operated for another 80 days at pet mps concentration of 50 particles l in influent as experiment stage stage ii the pet mps concentration 50 particles l and size 1 mm examined in this

aerobic activated sludge was collected from the secondary sedimentation tank of a local wastewater treatment plant traditional activated sludge process in guangzhou china the srb enriched sludge was obtained from the anaerobic bioreactor of the sani process in our laboratory that has been operating for more than four years the average volatile suspended solids vss concentration in the srusb bioreactor was maintained at 10 4 0 5 g l and the ratio of vss suspended solids ss was about 0 65 0 03 the hydraulic retention time hrt of the bioreactor was set to 6 h the concentrations of sulfate dissolved sulfide and chemical oxygen demand cod of the influent and effluent samples collected from the srusb bioreactor daily were analyzed following the standard methods apha 2005 the cod and dissolved sulfide concentrations in the samples were measured immediately after sample collection the actual cod value was determined by subtracting the theoretical cod value consumed by sulfide i e twice of the sulfide content from the measured cod value the possible transformation products of pet mps in effluent of sulfur mediated process were examined by an ultra performance liquid chromatography uplc according to the literature gong et al 2018 2 2 metabolic activity and viability of microbiota several analytical tests were conducted to investigate the stress response of sulfur mediated biological process to pet mps from the perspective of the microbial metabolic activity and viability the staining of live and dead cells in microbiota of sulfur mediated sludge was measured using the live dead baclight bacterial viability kits molecular probes l 7012 xu et al 2018 to examine the viability of microbiota in sulfur mediated sludge under pet mps stress more details can be found in page s3 in si atp is a multifunctional nucleotide used as a coenzyme in cells which plays a pivotal role in intracellular energy transfer and cell metabolism knowles 1980 therefore can be a useful indicator of microbial activity in this study the atp concentration was examined using the molecular probes atp determination kit a22066 thermofisher scientific america dha is a class of enzymes that catalyzes redox reactions of substances such as carbohydrates amino acids and organic acids the dha activity was determined by quantifying the amount of the reduced form of 2 3 5 triphenyltetrazoilum chloride ttc to indicate the total oxidative potential of microbiota in sulfur mediated sludge under pet mps stress xie et al 2009 more information about the dha measurement is described in the pages s3 s4 in si 2 3 cyt c content cyt c is an electron transfer protein on bacteria outer membrane and plays a crucial role in the process of extracellular electron transfer li et al 2019a in this study the cyt c content was examined to indicate the extracellular electron transfer efficiency of microorganism under pet mps exposure the extraction method of cyt c is according to the literature li et al 2019a more details of the cyt c extraction and detection were found in pages s4 s5 in si the cyt c concentrations of the biomass samples were determined by double antibody sandwich enzyme linked immunosorbent assay with the microbiological elisa kit feiya biotechnology jiangsu china 2 4 eps extraction and analyses eps is a macromolecular polymer secreted by microorganisms which is beneficial to the transformation of organic micropollutants and the maintenance of system stability in biological wastewater treatment systems zhang et al 2018 thus the content and compositions variation of eps extracted from sludge samples were characterized to reveal the stress responses of microorganisms to pet mps in srusb bioreactor eps of sludge samples were extracted as per the modified heat extraction method more details about the eps extraction is described in the page s5 in si li and yang 2007 the concentrations of polysaccharide ps protein pn and humic acid ha in eps were determined by the phenol sulfuric acid method modified lowry method and anthrone method respectively frolund et al 1995 wang et al 2015 the three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem fluorescence spectra of eps was detected following the 3d eem fluorescence spectroscopy more details are presented in page s5 in si zhang et al 2019 2 5 microbial community analysis biomass samples were obtained from the srusb reactor on days 40 and 120 for microbial community analysis which was conducted using polymerase chain reaction pcr amplification and 16s rrna gene targeted high throughput illumina sequencing the powersoil dna isolation kit mobio ca usa was used to extract the dna of each sample by following the manufacture s instruction all the dna samples were amplified by pcr using the primers set 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 and 338f 5 actcctacgggaggcagcag 3 targeting the v3 v4 regions of the bacterial 16s rrna gene xu et al 2016 and then the pcr products were sequenced by illumina miseq platform illumina inc san diego ca usa 2 6 electrochemical analysis electrochemical experiments were conducted with the chi electrochemical workstation chi660e chenhua shanghai china and a conventional three electrode cell which consists of a platinum wire counter electrode a glassy carbon working electrode 5 mm in diameter and an ag agcl reference electrode all aqueous solutions used in electrochemical analysis were purged with nitrogen for 30 mins at room temperature to ensure anoxic conditions potentials were measured against ag agcl reference electrode but are reported with reference to the standard hydrogen electrode she in this study all the electrochemical experiments of each sample were conducted in triplicate 2 6 1 direct electrochemical transfer the direct electron transfer det capacity of cyt c and eps was measured by the chronoamperometry methods according to the literature det was performed at e 0 59 v aeschbacher et al 2010 the detailed process as follows 8 ml of buffer 0 1 m pbs ph 7 0 was filled in the electrochemical cell and the electrode was balanced to the desired potentials e 0 59 v then 1 ml eps cyt c samples were added into the cell to record the current response over time the number of electrons transferred q μmol e was measured according to eq 1 i e reduction or oxidation current i integral over time t s 1 q 1 f t 1 t 2 idt where q μmol e refers to the number of electrons transferred f is the faraday constant 96 485 c mol e i c s is the current and t s is time 2 6 2 electrochemical reduction and oxidation mediated by eps the electron exchange capacity of eps extracted from the sludge which comprises the electron donating capacity qedc and electron accepting capacity qeac were obtained by using the chronoamperometry methods the experimental details of mediated electrochemical reduction mer and mediated electrochemical oxidation meo measurement were referred to the literature gorski et al 2012 first 8 ml of buffer 0 1 m pbs ph 7 0 was injected into the electrochemical cell to balance the electrode to the desired potentials i e e 0 49 v in mer and e 0 61 v in meo respectively then the electron transfer mediators 2 2 azinobis 3 ethylbenzthiazoline 6 sulfonic acid ammonium salt abts 10 mm in meo and diquat dibromide monohydrate dq 10 mm in mer were added into the electrochemical cell thereby generating oxidative and reductive currents respectively after regaining the background currents 1 ml eps samples were injected to the cells and record the current response over time the qeac and qedc of eps were calculated by integrating the current peak response according to eqs 2 and 3 2 q eac 1 f t 1 t 2 i red dt vss 3 q edc 1 f t 1 t 2 i ox dt vss where qeac and qedc were the amounts of electrons in eps per gram of vss sludge μmol e g vss 2 7 statistical analyses in this study all samples were analyzed in triplicate and the results were expressed as mean standard deviation statistical analyses were carried out to examine the significant difference statistically in data obtained from the two stages of reactor operation multiple comparisons were performed using one way analysis of variance anova with the least significant difference lsd below 0 05 p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of sulfur mediated biological process the performance of sulfur mediated biological process under the exposure of pet mps was evaluated based the cod removal and sulfate conversion as shown in fig 1 the cod removal and sulfate conversion efficiencies were 79 58 1 1 and 59 7 0 6 in stage i without pet mps and 86 2 1 3 and 64 2 0 9 in stage ii with 50 particles l of pet mps in influent respectively compared with microplastics inhibiting the nitrogen removal in activated sludge system he et al 2021 qin et al 2020 and methane production in anaerobic methanogenic sludge system wei et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 the presence of pet mps has no significantly negative effect on sulfur mediated biological process conversely the cod removal and sulfate converse efficiencies was improved by 6 6 0 5 and 4 5 0 3 respectively in the presence of pet mps the results indicated that the addition of pet mps has no inhibitory effect on sulfur mediated biological process reflecting the good adaptability of the sulfur mediated biological process to toxic substances such as microplastics the improvement of cod removal and sulfate reduction may owe to the enrichment of srb species evidenced by the higher relative abundance of srb species under pet mps exposure in sulfur mediated biological process fig 3 a almost all the reduced sulfate was converted to dissolved sulfide achieving a sulfur mass balance of 93 5 2 7 in srusb reactor previous studies have also demonstrated that sulfur mediated biological process is tolerant to pharmaceuticals jia et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 but this is the first study to investigate the response of sulfur mediated biological process on microplastics 3 2 microbial metabolic activity and community structure 3 2 1 microbial metabolic activity to determine the effects of pet mps on the viability and microbial metabolic activity of microbiota in sulfur mediated biological process the live dead cells distribution atp level and dha activity of biomass samples from srusb reactor were examined as shown in fig 2 a the results of live dead staining assay showed that the percentage of the live cells were 93 7 in stage i without pet mps addition and 94 0 in stage ii with 50 particles l of pet mps in influent obviously the presence of pet mps had no significant impact on the viability of microbiota in sulfur mediated biological process indicating the high adaptability of srb enriched sludge to pet mps in comparison the anaerobic fermentation process of waste activated sludge was susceptible to microplastics and the percentage of the dead cells increased significantly from 17 0 1 1 to 28 9 1 9 with increasing pet mps concentration from 10 to 60 particles g ts wei et al 2019 atp as an indicator of microbial activity increased correspondingly from 158 6 0 7 nmol g vss stage i to 297 2 2 5 nmol g vss stage ii fig 2 b in addition the dha activity increased significantly from 92 4 0 9 mg g vss in control stage i to 131 5 1 6 mg g vss in stage ii after long term exposure to 50 particles l of pet mps in influent fig 2 c atp as an activated energy carrier dha as the key enzymes involved in various biological oxidative activities they all play crucial roles in organic compounds degradation and microbial metabolism chen et al 2018 wang et al 2016 the increase of atp level and dha activity confirmed that the pet mps stimulated the microbial activity and improved the metabolic adaptation of microbiota in sulfur mediated biological process yang et al 2002 which well explained the excellent performance of sulfur mediated biological process this may be due to the fact that microplastics can be used as organic carbon substances for microorganisms to promote microbial metabolism seeley et al 2020 study reported that polylactic acid and polyurethane foam amended sediments promote nitrification and denitrification seeley et al 2020 other study also found that the presence of microplastics enhanced genes involved in cofactors and vitamin metabolism signal transduction cell motility and glycan biosynthesis and metabolism in aerobic granular sludge system zhao et al 2020 the study of chen et al 2021 also demonstrated that the polyamide 6 microplastics increased methane production due to the leachate caprolactam promoted the key enzymes activities 3 2 2 microbial community the microbial community of sulfur mediated biological process under different pet mps pressures were analyzed and the results are recorded in fig 3 as shown in fig 3 a the genera desulfobacter methanomethylovorans and mycobacteroides were the most abundant bacterial populations in sulfur mediated biological process accounting for 21 1 0 5 and 18 1 0 6 of the total bacterial community in stage i and stage ii respectively however long term exposure to sulfate and pet mps under anaerobic condition reduced the relative abundance of mycobacteroides a strictly aerobic genus griffith 2009 and methanogens methanomethylovorans hu et al 2018 but enriched the genera desulfobacter desulfuromonas and desulfomonile these srb species have been documented to have ability of reducing sulfate and biodegrading organic substances muyzer and stams 2008 rabus et al 2006 which was in accord with the excellent performance of sulfate reduction and cod removal in srusb reactor fig 1 it has been confirmed that microplastics such as polyhydroxyalkanoate pha can be degraded by sewage sludge through hydrolysis acetogenesis and methanogenesis under different redox conditions such as sulfate reduction ma et al 2022 pinnell et al 2019 also found that the biofilm can be formed on large microplastics with a diameter of 3 4 mm at the sediment water interface and the polyhydroxyalkanoate microplastics can promote the growth of srb in addition studies found that most genera of desulfobacteraceae and desulfobulbaceae are dominant genera with a high relative abundance under polyvinyl chloride exposure in marsh sediment seeley et al 2020 these results suggested that srb has good adaptability and degradation potential to microplastics moreover the relative abundance of electroactive bacteria geobacter increased from 1 2 0 1 to 1 9 0 1 under pet mps exposure studies reported that abundant extracellular cyt c are the primary functional eps components of electroactive bacteria liu et al 2018 shi et al 2009 steidl et al 2016 therefore the result may be linked to the higher content and electron transfer capacity of cyt c under pet mps exposure figs 4 a and 5 b it is apparent that the chronic exposure of pet mps increased the relative abundances of key srb species and electroactive bacteria in addition the shift of the srb genera in sulfur mediated biological process was detected in this study the changes in genera of srb during long time exposure to pet mps can be divided into two groups as shown in fig 3 b group 1 including desulfococcus syntrophobacter desulfobacca and other 11 srb genera obviously decreased after addition of 50 particles l of pet mps in influent conversely the desulfobacter desulfuromonas desulfomonile and other 13 srb genera in group 2 increased significantly accounting for 75 2 and 85 7 of the total detected srb genera in stage i and stage ii respectively these results suggested that the selective pressure of pet mps induced the shift of srb microbial community from group 1 to group 2 desulfobacter dominated genera and the desulfobacter dominated microbiota in group 2 is more adaptable to pet mps than srb genera in group 1 further we calculated the relative abundance of total srb genera the srb genera in total genera in sludge samples from two stages in srusb reactor apparently the relative abundance of srb genera increased significantly from 13 1 stage i pet mps 0 particles l in influent to 16 5 stage ii pet mps 50 particles l in influent p 0 05 it may be due to the pet mps was used as organic carbon substance for srb growth in sulfur mediated process the transformation products of pet mps bis 2 hydroxyethyl terephthalate bhet and mono 2 hydroxyethyl terephthalic acid mhet were also detected in the effluent of sulfur mediated process see fig s2 in si in addition previous studies have also reported that microplastics can act as organic carbon source to facilitate the growth of srb ma et al 2022 pinnell and turner 2019 seeley et al 2020 for example a novel bacterium strain ideonella sakaiensis isolated from sediment which is able to use pet as its major energy and carbon source and convert pet into its two environmentally benign monomers mhet and terephthalic acid tpa yoshida et al 2016 gong et al 2018 confirmed that pet derived mps can act as sole substrate for bacteria and produce bhet mhet tpa and methyl acrylate ma through biodegradation and hydrolysis moreover torena et al 2021 reported that pet mps can serve as a carrier for biofilm forming and facilitates the growth of microorganisms these results of the microbial community of sulfur mediated biological sludge strongly supported the improved cod removal and sulfate conversion efficiencies in section 3 1 the degradation of pet mps may be contributed to the srb metabolism and this hypothesis should be confirmed in future studies 3 3 electron transfer process in sulfur mediated biological process 3 3 1 characterization of electroactive substances cyt c and eps the removal and conversion of pollutants in biological sludge system are significantly correlated with the extracellular electron transfer and oxidation reduction reactions between microorganisms he et al 2020 li et al 2017 2019b su et al 2019 the redox complexes cyt c as one of electron mediators plays a key role in direct interspecies electron transfer kumar et al 2016 shi et al 2016 moreover eps has been demonstrated to be electroactive and can act as electron shuttles to enhance the interspecies electron transfer in biological sludge systems he et al 2020 li et al 2019b therefore the electroactive substances cyt c and eps were examined to indicate the electron transfer activity of sulfur mediated biological process under pet mps stress as shown in fig 4 a the presence of pet mps significantly stimulated the cyt c production the content of cyt c was 17 83 0 4 nmol g vss in stage ii which was significantly higher than that in stage i 11 6 0 2 nmol g vss cyt c located in pili and the outer membrane of microorganisms mediates extracellular electron transfer and has been proved to be involved in transformation of pollutants cai et al 2012 xu et al 2022a thus the higher content of cyt c signified higher efficiency of det and redox reactions in sulfur mediated biological process under pet mps exposure it was due to the enrichment of the electroactive microorganisms such as geobacter shewanella and rhodoferax under pet mps exposure study demonstrated that abundant cyt c exists in the extracellular membrane of electroactive microorganism shi et al 2007 eps an indispensable part of biological sludge is composed of polymers secreted by microorganisms and involved in most extracellular metabolic pathways sheng et al 2010 tang et al 2020 changes in eps structure and composition of sludge samples from sulfur mediated biological process under pet mps exposure were examined as shown in fig 4 b the proteins polysaccharides and humic acid are the main components in eps long term exposure to pet mps at 50 particles l significantly increased eps secretion especially proteins and humic acid increased by 5 1 and 37 6 respectively such increases suggested that more eps was secreted to defend the microbiota from the toxicity of pet mps sheng et al 2010 zhang et al 2019 this finding was consistent with the previous study which demonstrated that polyethylene microplastics improved the microbial activity in natural surface water increased the production of eps and formed biofilm on the surface of microplastic particles xiong et al 2021 studies demonstrated that the redox active proteins humic acid and fulvic acid in eps can mediate the extracellular electron transfer between electroactive bacteria or other microorganisms and thereby influence the pollutants removal he et al 2020 li et al 2019b therefore the increase of eps content indicated that pet mps stimulates the microbial activity and improves the det efficiency in sulfur mediated biological process furthermore the changes of the fluorescence components in eps after exposure to pet mps were examined and presented in fig 4 c apparently there are five major fluorescence peaks in eps peak a ex em 290 340 365 nm were assigned to tryptophan protein like compounds chen et al 2003 peak b ex em 340 380 495 530 nm and peak c ex em 420 480 500 540 nm was assigned to humic like fractions chen et al 2003 in stage ii peak d ex em 260 280 405 450 nm and peak e ex em 300 350 405 450 nm which was identified as fulvic acid like and humic like substances chen et al 2003 appeared in eps after exposure to pet mps the fluorescence intensity of eps was enhanced with the addition of pet mps which is consistent with the results that the eps content especially humic acid increased remarkably under pet mps exposure in sulfur mediated biological process fig 4 b these results suggested that the addition of pet mps is indeed beneficial to the electron transfer in sulfur mediated biological process in order to explore the effect of pet mps on electron transfer efficiency in sulfur mediated biological process the electron transfer capacity of cyt c and eps was quantitatively detected as discussed in the following section 3 3 2 the det capacity of cyt c and eps the det capacity of cyt c and eps in sulfur mediated biological process under pet mps exposure was examined via chronoamperometry gorski et al 2012 as shown in fig 5 a the current increased after the addition of cyt c result in a current peak and then kept decreasing until it returned to the background current it indicated that det occurs between the working electrode and the cyt c gorski et al 2012 apparently the current responses of cyt c in stage ii were greater than that in stage i which was consistent with the results in fig 4 a that the cyt c concentration at stage ii was significantly higher than that of stage i in addition we calculated the det capacity of cyt c via integrating the current peak response ye et al 2018 as shown in fig 5 b the det capacity of cyt c is 18 06 0 4 μmol e μmol cyt c in stage i which is significantly lower than that in stage ii 30 9 0 6 μmol e μmol cyt c the results indicated that the pet mps improved the det capacity of cyt c similar experiments were performed to quantify the det capacity of eps as shown in fig 5 c the addition of eps result in current response demonstrating that eps can mediate det it was due to redox active proteins in eps have the same function as cyt c which has been proved to mediate the det yang et al 2019 ye et al 2018 in addition the similar results were found in eps where the current responses and det capacity of eps in stage ii 0 237 0 014 μmol e g vss were significantly higher than those in stage i 0 031 0 001 μmol e g vss apparently the contribution of cyt c and eps to electron transfer capacity in stage ii was greater than that in stage i these results suggested that the pet mps improved the det capacity of cyt c and eps which favor pollutants removal in sulfur mediated biological process 3 3 3 the indirect electron transfer capacity of eps the qeac qedc and total electron exchanging capacity qtotal qedc qeac of eps were measured via chronoamperometry li et al 2019b and the results showed that the eps is capable of electron transfer as shown in fig 6 in the presence of dq the addition of eps caused a reductive current peak fig 6 a suggesting that dq mediate electron transfer from the working electrode to the eps the addition of abts caused an oxidative peak of eps in fig 6 b demonstrating that abts mediate electron transfer from the eps to the working electrode the qeac and qedc of eps were obtained by integrating the reductive current peak and oxidative current peak response respectively li et al 2019b as shown in fig 6 c the qtotal of eps was mainly attributed by qeac and increased significantly after 50 particles l pet mps addition reaching 2 97 0 12 μmol e g vss in stage ii it was attributed to the higher eps

15609,for a safe enclosure of contaminants for instance in deep geological repositories of radioactive waste any processes retarding metal migration are of paramount importance this study focusses on the sorption of trivalent actinides am cm and lanthanides eu to the surface of muscovite a mica and main component of most crystalline rocks granites granodiorites batch sorption experiments quantified the retention regarding parameters like ph varied between 3 and 9 metal concentration from 0 5 µm cm to 10 µm eu or solid to liquid ratio 0 13 and 5 25 g l 1 in addition time resolved laser fluorescence spectroscopy trlfs using the actinide cm iii identified two distinct inner sphere surface species combining both approaches allowed the development of a robust surface complexation model and the determination of stability constants of the spectroscopically identified species of s oh 2m3 logko 8 89 s o 2m logko 4 11 and s o 2moh logko 10 6 with all values extrapolated to infinite dilution the inclusion of these stability constants into thermodynamic databases will improve the prognostic accuracy of lanthanide and actinide transport through groundwater channels in soils and crystalline rock systems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords mica trivalent actinides retardation trlfs diffuse double layer model data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction hazardous waste from a manifold of sources must be confined from the ecosphere and specifically from entering the food chain prominent examples are metal ore mining and processing fertilizer production nuclear power generation geothermics decommissioning of industrial installations and most branches of consumer good production to safely dispose of such contaminants for long periods is a huge challenge and of great societal concern in the case of radioactive waste safe isolation for 1 million years is demanded by german law to be considered in safety assessments nea 2006 engineered barriers are usually expected to fail in their protection functions after thousands of years after which the influx of groundwater will mobilize toxic materials and potentially introduce such species into the water table in case of radioactive waste and with the ability for mineralogical formations to retain mobile species this has led to the consideration of deep geological storage as the most viable option in many countries such as russia japan usa and germany blyth et al 2009 ojovan et al 2019 vokál et al 2010 the selection and characterization of a suitable multi shell encapsulation system including the host rock requires serious consideration to prevent transfer of radionuclides into the ecosphere granitic rock is one such formation bge 2020 laverov et al 2016 oy 2012 yamamoto et al 2013 and consists predominantly of quartz feldspar and mica in varying ratios studies conducted on the immobilization characteristics of complete mineral assemblies will generate information on a specific granite only alterations in composition may however alter performance between samples with mechanistic understanding of the sorbing capabilities of individual mineral phases a more universal approach can be generated further improving predictions for retardation capabilities within complex rock assemblies stockmann et al 2017 minor actinides americium and curium but also plutonium contribute significantly to the total radiotoxicity of spent nuclear fuel and are expected to occur in their trivalent oxidation state under the strongly reducing conditions developing over time in a deep geological repository as pu iii is a big challenge for experimental designs many sorption studies have focused on am iii and cm iii as well as an inactive rare earth analogue eu iii all of them keeping their oxidation state even under oxidizing conditions here interactions with mineral phases such as feldspars neumann et al 2021a stumpf et al 2006b clays hartmann et al 2011 schnurr et al 2015 stumpf et al 2004 and aluminum huittinen et al 2009 and iron oxides stumpf et al 2006a as well as quartz garcía et al 2019 are of highest importance surface complexation models scm for actinide sorption have also been developed for some of these systems in a brief overview quartz was reported to display two distinct adsorbed species s o 2heu between ph 3 5 and 6 and s o 2euoh as ph increases that vary in immobilization contribution dependent on ionic strength garcía et al 2019 feldspar minerals have been reported to display as many as four distinct surface species s oh 2m3 s o 2m s o 2moh and s o 2m oh 2 verified utilizing both scm and spectroscopy neumann et al 2021 stumpf et al 2006b mica minerals such as muscovite as major components of granitic rock have been the focus of several studies investigating their retention potential towards radionuclides some investigations also covered effects of counter ions on sorption of trivalent metal ions lee et al 2013 neumann et al 2022 pan et al 2017 yan et al 2013 of co ions on nano particle formation of tetravalent actinides neumann et al 2021 or speciation on u vi sorption arnold et al 2006 richter et al 2016 most of these studies used large single crystals as substrates however and hence there is still a distinct lack of a fundamental understanding of sorption of trivalent actinides an iii and a realistic set of species required to parametrize respective scms to close gaps in thermodynamic databases richter 2015 with the utilization of µtrlfs sorption of trivalent actinides has been discovered to mainly occur along mineral grain boundaries blyth et al 2009 demnitz et al 2022 molodtsov et al 2021 2019 in natural granite samples including those of the mica mineral fractions muscovite is a mica mineral that is both abundant and chemically analogous to illite and weathering processes of this mineral cause the formation of many other clay minerals and colloidal species jackson et al 1948 for example muscovite is a major component of a variety of soils anand and gilkes 1987 wilson 2004 and also 22 of the mineralogical matrix at the grimsel test site gts degueldre et al 1989 soler and mäder 2010 an underground research laboratory facility in a crystalline rock formation in switzerland used for research projects related to radioactive waste disposal in situ experiments conducted in a fracture zone at the gts showed that transport of trivalent actinides am cm and pu occurred mainly colloid mediated in particular through their adsorption to mobile clay colloids geckeis et al 2004 möri et al 2003 it therefore seems imperative that the behavior of muscovite will be pivotal for an overarching model describing the long term mobility of disposed radio toxic waste compounds hence this work strives for the formulation of a scm for the sorption of an iii ln iii to the surface of muscovite based on a sound molecular level understanding of the interfacial speciation as the data situation with respect to metal cation sorption onto other micas biotite chlorite phlogopite glauconite is similarly disappointing any muscovite sorption model may at least be indicative or serve for scoping calculations also for such systems the information derived from such studies will help improve the accuracy of reactive transport models such as the smart k d concept stockmann et al 2017 which is a modern and robust approach to simulate contaminant transport through complex geochemical systems the premise behind this concept is the computation of distribution coefficients k d values based on sorption equilibria for each relevant ion mineral combination in a comprehensive and competitive manner such calculations exploit the mechanistic understanding casted into validated surface complexation and ion exchange models then it is easy to perform these computations for a wide range of physicochemical parameters generating multidimensional matrices they in turn are used in reactive transport codes for a more reliable prediction of contaminant transport through ground water pathways within the host rock taking into consideration localized geochemical conditions and decreasing the computational costs for each simulation stockmann et al 2017 this study combines sorption experiments ph edges and isotherms with trlfs investigations in the exploration of trivalent actinide am cm and lanthanide eu sorption to the surface of muscovite in a next step scms are generated with and without the implementation of spectroscopically observed species the finally selected species set with respective reaction constants are valuable expansions to thermodynamic databases namely they allow for a more realistic description of actinide immobilization by muscovite e g as a major constituent of granitic rock thus our approach provides robust thermodynamic data based on molecular level speciation derived from spectroscopic investigations due to the use of multiple trivalent actinides and lanthanides the data are nonetheless generic and can be used to describe the interaction of any trivalent f elements with muscovite mica the resulting increased modeling accuracy for long term safety assessments aids in the selection of sites suitable for deep geological storage of radioactive waste 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials for all sorption experiments nacl was purchased from sigma aldrich and hcl and naoh sigma aldrich were used for ph adjustments an 243am stock solution in 0 01 m hcl was diluted for batch contacts a stock solution of 248cm in 1 m hclo4 was diluted for trlfs experiments and eucl3 6h2o 99 9 abcr chemie was used for batch sorption experiments milli q water was produced via ultrafiltration membrapure astacus2 and its resistance was measured to be 18 mω synthetic muscovite mica sheets v1 quality afm standard 25 75 mm were supplied by ted pella inc redding california usa the mineral sheets were crushed into platelets by a tungsten carbide ball mill fritsch pulverisette 7 planetary micro mill then sieved to a size fraction of 20 63 µm via dry vibrational sieving fritsch pulverisette 7 sieve the crystal structure of the mineral was analyzed using powder x ray diffraction pxrd rigaku miniflex600 and the pdxl software suite and elemental composition was analyzed

sandwiched between two silicate tetrahedral layers t and a potassium interlayer between sheets as many common phyllosilicate minerals contain a range of transitional metals xfa was used for the determination of the mineral s iron concentration 1 9 table s1 which is relevant for the interpretation of the trlfs results see below the specific surface area ssa 18 1 m2 g 1 was measured using n2 bet analysis quantachrome asiqwin quadrasorb and the surface binding site density ssd 2 61 sites nm 2 was obtained from literature arnold et al 2001 zeta potential measurements of the muscovite powder were conducted by first generating a range of 20 samples with a solid liquid ratio slr of 0 15 g l 1 and nacl of 0 1 m and ph adjustments were conducted by addition of negligible quantities of 1 0 1 or 0 01 m hcl or naoh suspensions were equilibrated over a 48 h period in an end over end agitator before surface charge measurements were taken by zeta potential measurements malvern company zetasizer nano zs respective results are reported within the supplemental information fig s1 2 2 sorption experiments 2 2 1 batch sorption experiments ph edges eu iii batch sorption experiments were conducted by the generation of mineral suspension with an slr of either 1 or 3 g l 1 and metal concentrations of 10 or 0 5 µm eu iii all sorption experiments with eu were performed under atmospheric conditions the investigated metal concentrations represent typical ree concentrations measured for waste water of ree mining sites up to 80 µm and lower grawunder et al 2014 hao et al 2016 merten et al 2005 expected concentrations for trivalent actinides in the vicinity of a nuclear waste repository are significantly lower keesmann et al 2005 zhao et al 2016 the chosen slr and metal concentrations correspond to site occupancies of 18 see section 3 in si for further explanation assuming a bidentate binding mechanism at which surface precipitation is not expected for ph 8 table s2 the background electrolyte concentration was set to 0 1 m nacl to maintain constant ionic strength and the ph of each suspension was altered by addition of negligible quantities of 1 0 1 or 0 01 m naoh or hcl samples were prepared as singlets after ph adjustment suspensions were equilibrated for 48 h by end over end agitation in ambient conditions 25 1 c scoping calculations with phreeqc and the thermochimie tdb version 10a blanc et al 2015 giffaut et al 2014 grivé et al 2015 were performed to estimate the amount of eu potentially transforming into secondary solid phases the maximum eu considered was 10 5 mol l in the ph edge experiments at ph 6 beyond which sorption will reduce the eu content in the aqueous phase significantly here only eu oh 3 am and eu oh co3 0 5h2o were assumed relevant as any formation of well crystalline minerals within only five days and at ambient temperatures is implausible the saturation indices for the two solids were 5 62 and 5 81 respectively therefore no precipitation is expected from a theoretical point of view and indeed no secondary phase formation was observed in any sorption experiment 243am experiments were undertaken in a similar manner slr of 3 g l 1 and am3 of 10 µm but in a nitrogen glovebox for radiation protection reasons and agitation was conducted on an orbital shaker for all sorption samples post contact ph of the suspension was measured prior to centrifugation for 20 min 3 46 g and afterwards three aliquots of the supernatant were taken for analysis of remaining metal concentration via icp ms perkinelmer las nexion 350x displayed error bars represent the standard deviation of the triple icp ms measurement the quantitative information from the cm iii trlfs results was also considered here 2 2 2 sorption isotherm experiments sorption isotherm experiments were conducted in a similar manner to the batch sorption experiments however a static ph ph 7 was decided upon to minimize mineral dissolution and ensure complete uptake of available eu3 90 see fig s3 in si for details deviating from the usual isotherm philosophy eu3 was kept constant at 1 5 µm in order to alleviate concerns of the precipitation of amorphous eu oh 3 or eu oh co3 0 5h2o the respective saturation indices are 3 55 and 0 26 computed as outlined under section 2 2 1 assuming no sorption this would translate into a maximum of about 45 of initial eu being theoretically precipitated as eu oh co3 0 5h2o instead of varying eu the slr was altered between 0 13 and 5 25 g l 1 corresponding to a site occupancy of 0 75 and 50 the minimal slr investigated 0 13 g l 1 provided a maximum of 50 theoretical site occupancy lützenkirchen and behra 1996 also minimizing the risk of surface precipitation mineral suspensions were equilibrated over 48 h in d i water before addition of electrolyte solution and ph equilibration where ph was adjusted as above after ph remained steady over a 24 h period suspensions were spiked with a eu iii stock solution if a ph drift was observed during the reaction time it was adjusted back to the desired ph and contacted until the ph remained stable 0 05 for a minimum of 48 h equilibrated suspensions were centrifuged and analyzed in the same manner as those within the batch sorption experiments sorption isotherm data were fit to three common two parameter models in brief the freundlich model is described by the following equation dada et al 2012 ho et al 2002 1 q e a f c e bf it contains two constants the relative adsorption capacity a f and the heterogeneity factor or intensity of binding b f both unitless dada et al 2012 where a value of 1 alludes to multi layer sorption 0 alludes to irreversible binding and 1 b f 0 describes the homogeneity the higher the value the more heterogeneous potentially displaying multiple bound species with respect to the langmuir isotherm 2 q e q m a l c e 1 a l c e the monolayer sorption equilibrium constant is given by a l l m2 mol 1 and the value of q m mol m 2 relates to the equilibrium sorption capacity ho et al 2002 lastly we applied the dubinin radushkevich d r model ho et al 2002 3 q e q d exp b d rt ln 1 1 c e 2 which describes both the homogeneous binding capacity q d mol m 2 and the energies of binding e kj mol 1 and therefore further mechanistic information b d 4 e 1 2 b d where sorbent sorbate interactions can be elucidated e 8 kj mol 1 equates to physisorption outer sphere sorption van der waals interactions 8 kj mol 1 e 16 kj mol 1 equates to intermediate cases and e 16 kj mol 1 equates to chemisorption inner sphere sorption bulai et al 2009 2 3 time resolved laser induced fluorescence spectroscopy trlfs for structural investigations the actinide cm iii was used as a luminescent probe at a concentration of 0 5 µm at an slr of 3 g l 1 in the ph range 4 5 7 5 the sample preparation was performed within a glove box under nitrogen atmosphere for radiation safety reasons a pulsed 5 8 ns nd yag opo laser system powerlite precision ii 9020 coupled with an opo panther ex opo continuum usa was used for excitation of the sample at the most intense adsorption line 8s7 2 6i11 2 of cm iii at 396 6 nm within a quartz cuvette the luminescence was collected using an optical fiber and transferred to a 300 lines mm grating polychromator andor kymera 328i c and ccd camera istar dh320t 18u 63 a delay between the laser pulse and luminescence measurement of 1 µs was generated dg535 digital delay generator stanford research systems inc for protection of the detector from intense pulses with increasing complexation of cm iii a red shift of the emission band with respect to the cm iii aquo ion 593 8 nm is observed therefore from the spectral deconvolution of emission spectra the cm iii speciation can be obtained with the band positions of single component spectra giving information about their chemical environment with the change in the emission band also a shift of the absorption maximum of each species is observed therefore the efficiency of the luminescence excitation is reduced to deduce the relative abundances of the distinct chemical species their contribution to the overall speciation needs correction by relative fluorescence intensity fi factors edelstein et al 2006 furthermore the lifetime of this luminescence is also highly dependent on the hydration shell of cm iii and with analysis of this lifetime the number of waters within the hydration shell can be determined kimura et al 1996 there are however limitations of this approach to speciation determination the first of which is that both the cm aquo ion and its outer sphere sorption complex will return the same emission spectra as neither species display alteration of the inner hydration sphere the second is that with the presence of transition metals specifically iron in the mineral sample relaxation processes will quench the luminescence by non radiative energy transfer hartmann et al 2008 this quenching process will decrease the reliability of both lifetime analysis and fi calculation fi factors for mineral sorption species can however be calculated from the species band position using the relationship described in eibl et al 2019 2 4 surface complexation modelling scm the determination of the surface complexation parameters was conducted through coupling the geochemical speciation software phreeqc version 3 6 2 15100 charlton and parkhurst 2011 parkhurst and appelo 2013 and the parameter estimation code ucode 2014 version 1 004 poeter et al 2014 a diffuse double layer model was applied dzombak and morel 1990 for aqueous speciation of eu iii cm iii and am iii as well as mineral dissolution thermodynamic data the thermochimie phreeqc tdb version 10a blanc et al 2015 giffaut et al 2014 grivé et al 2015 was used the surface of muscovite was considered to contain one generic functional group surface site s oh with protolysis values pk a taken from literature arnold et al 2001 i e valid at their experimental ionic strength of 0 1 m being identical to the one in this work 5 s oh h s oh 2 pk1 6 06 6 s oh s o h pk2 7 81 an overview of the thermodynamic parameters used in the scm is given in table 2 3 results 3 1 batch sorption experiments 3 1 1 aqueous speciation the aqueous speciation of each system am iii cm iii and eu iii were calculated at experimentally relevant conditions using phreeqc see section 5 in si m3 is the predominant species in all data series up to a ph of 7 5 where it is overtaken by hydrolysis products m oh 2 or m oh 2 between ph 8 5 and 10 m oh 2 is the most dominant species in each case before being overtaken by m oh 3 at ph 10 5 for eu iii as we have limited the ph range to ph 9 the neutral species can thus be neglected the introduction of carbonate changes the speciation slightly especially under alkaline ph conditions with the mco3 complex being dominant for ph 8 8 5 as experiments with am iii were conducted under exclusion of atmospheric co2 any influence of carbonate complexation should be visible as differences between the eu iii and am iii data in this ph range moreover carbonate complexation in solution or as a ternary complex on the muscovite surface should be easily identifiable by cm iii trlfs kim et al 1994 marques fernandes et al 2010 3 1 2 ph edges the sorption data of eu iii and am iii spectroscopically observed cm iii sorption data has been also included are reported on the surface of muscovite flakes 63 µm in order to gain insight into site occupancy effects on the sorption edge two slr 1 and 3 g l 1 and two concentrations eu3 0 5 and 10 µm were investigated with an extension to am iii 10 µm m3 slr of 3 g l 1 and cm iii 0 5 µm m3 slr of 3 g l 1 the percentage immobilization as a function of ph is given in fig 1 eu iii immobilization on muscovite begins at ph 5 and reaches 100 by a ph of 6 5 fig 1 the obtained sorption edges show a small shift towards lower ph with decreasing maximum site occupancy fig 1 left to right one noticeable deviation is observed for the spectroscopically derived cm iii data see below at highest ph values pink symbols in fig 1 right while both am iii and eu iii reach a plateau at 100 immobilization at ph 6 5 the plateau for cm iii begins at the same ph but only reaches 90 immobilization which is likely caused by the presence of 10 outer spherical bound cm this is because it is impossible to distinguish outer sphere complexes from the aquo ion by trlfs due to the lack of changes in the first hydration shell of cm the data for eu iii measured in normal atmosphere and the am iii data measured under n2 atmosphere are identical within the precision of the measurement suggesting no influence of carbonate on the sorption process a confirmation of this assumption on the molecular level will however have to rely on spectroscopic data 3 1 3 sorption isotherms the isotherm data is plotted in fig 2 with q e equilibrium concentration of eu iii adsorbed on the mineral surface mol m 2 as a function of c e equilibrium solution phase concentration of eu iii adjusted for available mineral surface area mol l 1 m2 this data plot is combined with fitted langmuir freundlich and d r isotherms sorption of eu iii to muscovite displays an initially steep isotherm profile indicative of strong sorption beyond a c e of 2 0 10 6 mol m 2 this profile begins to display a gentler slope while not leveling out completely this alteration in isotherm profile is coupled with a slow approach to adsorption saturation of the surface as extraction efficiency decreases from 100 to 90 fig s3 the values generated by fitting the isotherm data to the models cf section 2 2 2 are reported within table 1 the sorption data were reasonably well fit to all three models r2 0 97 the fits to the freundlich isotherm relate to a strong binding mechanism b f of 0 48 leading to the determination that within the site occupancy range studied no surface precipitation or cooperative binding multi layer mechanism was apparent the langmuir model returns an equilibrium sorption capacity q m of 6 7 0 8 10 7 mol m 2 which slightly exceeds the maximum equilibrium concentration of adsorbed eu iii qe on the mineral surface covered by our measurements 6 0 10 7 mol m 2 despite this extrapolation of the experimental data the langmuir model is still a reasonable descriptor of the data at hand in stark contrast the homogeneous binding capacity q d for the d r isotherm is 1 0 0 4 10 5 mol m 2 and is based on a much larger extrapolation of this data see orange curve in fig 2 leading to very tentative reliance on this model in other words the result of our isotherm analysis overestimates the amount of sorption since the homogeneous binding capacity is 2 3 times larger than the total number of available sorption sites according to the ssd used in our scm 2 61 sites nm 2 corresponding to 4 33 10 6 mol m 2 arnold et al 2001 it is possible that a contribution of outer sphere species leads to the high value of qd as outer spherically bound species do not occupy specific sorption sites the e value determined from the d r isotherm model of 12 3 kj mol 1 is in between the typical energies of physisorption and chemisorption which can be interpreted as a combination of both processes consistent with the interpretation of the value for the homogeneous binding capacity in short while details vary between different isotherms all models describe a strong heterogeneous binding mechanism both the freundlich and langmuir isotherms describe a process that occurs in the absence of any precipitation this in conjunction to a high heterogeneity factor and a d r binding energy between physisorption and chemisorption leads to the allusion of multiple reactions causing sorption of eu iii onto the surface of muscovite with these assumptions in mind it can be assumed that there is a combination of both outer sphere physisorption and inner sphere sorption chemisorption mechanisms creating the measured sorption profiles 3 2 time resolved laser induced fluorescence spectroscopy trlfs by trlfs measurement using the luminophore cm iii we are able to gain insight into the speciation and potentially the sorption mechanism of an iii ln iii on muscovite as the position of the 6d7 2 8s7 2 luminescence band shifts depending on the chemical environment of cm iii the peak deconvolution of the measured cm emission spectra enables the identification of the present species and their quantitative contributions to the overall speciation eibl et al 2019 huittinen et al 2012 stumpf et al 2001 with this information further deductions can be made upon the mechanisms of sorption of an iii ln iii the spectra utilized in deconvolution residual spectra after deconvolution and deconvoluted single component spectra are plotted in fig 3 due to the iron content of the muscovite samples table s1 the signal to noise ratio of the emission spectra was relatively low and while lifetimes can be derived from our data they do not contain the structural information with respect to the number of water molecules in the cm s first coordination sphere due to the excess quenching effect of structural fe in addition to the cm iii aquo ion a minimum of two distinct species were required in order to minimize the residual spectra fig 3 left black after deconvolution these species have been assigned as an inner sphere surface complex sc of cm iii sc2 s o 2m peak at 598 nm and its hydrolysis species sc3 s o 2moh peak at 603 nm by referencing similar studies on k feldspar neumann et al 2021a illite montmorillonite schnurr et al 2015 and kaolinite huittinen et al 2012 2010 deconvolution of individual species spectra became difficult due to the simultaneous occurrence of multiple species overall low signal quality as well as a potential small contribution 5 of a fourth species therefore deconvolution was conducted based on single component spectra available in the literature for the sorption of cm iii on another alumino silicate mineral k feldspar neumann et al 2021 these spectra are shown as translucent lines in fig 3 right the peak deconvolution resulted in a quantitative species distribution fig 4 which was corrected by fi values aquo ion 1 0 sc2 0 54 sc3 0 29 neumann et al 2021 the contribution of spectroscopically indistinguishable cm aquo ion outer sphere species sc1 fig 4 left decreases steeply from 100 at ph 5 to 10 at ph 6 from here there is a steady decrease to 5 beyond ph 7 as discussed above complete uptake is observed in batch sorption experiments under identical experimental conditions therefore the observation of a small amount of fully hydrated cm can be interpreted as a constant contribution of outer spherically bound cm to the speciation the species designated sc2 fig 4 middle present from ph 5 and higher is assumed to be analogous to the bidentate inner sphere sorption species reported for the k feldspar s o 2m displaying a gentle onset reaching a relative abundance of 40 at ph 6 parallel to the formation of sc2 its first hydrolysis product s o 2moh sc3 fig 3 right is formed and reaches a maximum relative abundance of 70 by ph 7 being the most abundant of the spectrally observable species there is no evidence of carbonate complex species in solution or on the mineral surface at those ph values where relevant carbonate concentrations would be expected most cm iii has already been adsorbed to the surface consequently dissolved carbonate complexes can only play a minor role and are not observed spectroscopically ternary surface complexes involving carbonate should exhibit larger red shifts 606 nm marques fernandes et al 2010 than were found in our experiments due to the low signal to noise ratio we cannot unambiguously conclude that such species do not form but it appears evident that they are at most minor species under these conditions 3 3 surface complexation modelling scm the surface complexation model was developed utilizing two distinct methods building on each other both models have in common that they postulate bidentate species because the entropic effect should favor the formation of bidentate complexes wang and giammar 2013 the first modeling approach scm a is stepwise increasing the number of surface species in order to both describe the batch sorption data and minimize the total number of surface species it is empirical as it does not take into account specific spectroscopic information consequently scm a was initially attempted with a single surface species increasing the complexity of the system as additional species were included stoichiometry of each species was based upon the aqueous speciation within the ph region of the conducted batch sorption experiments fig s2 the second modeling approach scm b further expands the scm a basis it incorporates spectroscopically observed species in combination with the batch sorption data for the formation of the initial species estimation within the model the comparison of both models to experimental data is shown in fig 1 modeled species and their corresponding log k values are reported in table 2 the nomenclature denotes the level of hydrolysis of sorbed eu iii with sc1 being the potential outer sphere complex not releasing any protons upon formation scm a i e the model without consideration of the spectroscopic data showed that two distinct species were sufficient to describe the experimental batch sorption edges of eu iii and am iii fig 1 these two major species were assigned as a an outer sphere species sc1 dominating the surface speciation until ph 6 fig s6 however when comparing the experimentally observed and simulated contributions of these two species fig 4 it becomes obvious that there are major deviations in particular scm a overestimates dramatically the amount of outer sphere sorption which can be easily seen by the orange line in fig 4 left which displays the sum of cm aquo ion and outer sphere sorption including additional surface complexes within the model led to either the repression of these species to an abundance of zero throughout the fitting or failure of the modeling process to determine a suitable fit at all this behavior illustrates the necessity to provide speciation data derived independent from the modeling process which is why we include the spectroscopically obtained speciation in the next step with the incorporation of the spectroscopically determined speciation i e scm b the upper region of the modeled sorption edge is shifted to slightly lower ph both models were capable of describing both inner and outer sphere surface complexes however considering spectroscopic data scm b also incorporated sc3 see fig 4 purple lines consequently the abundance of sc2 was greatly reduced in place of sc3 4 discussion the sorption edges recorded for am iii cm iii and eu iii overlap with regards to similar suspension conditions reaffirming the assumptions of analogous behavior of an iii ln iii lee et al 2006 while the directly comparable analysis of am iii and eu iii reproduced identical sorption edges there is a slight discrepancy between those of am iii eu iii and cm iii this is caused by the two different experimental approaches and the fact that differentiation between cm aquo ion and outer sphere complexes within the trlfs data is impossible with an inclusion of the spectroscopic data all three site occupancies are well described by the scm the aqueous speciation of each an iii ln iii e g hydrolysis or carbonate complexation fig s2 appears to have little effect on the sorption behavior although spectroscopic data shows that hydrolysis does occur at the interface the transition from m3 to moh2 or mco3 in solution occurs between ph 7 and 8 while sorption in each case begins already at or below ph 5 reaching near completion by ph 6 previous studies have noted sorption occurring earlier and reported contributions by outer sphere sorption at the lower ph values pan et al 2017 yan et al 2013 this feature is less apparent within this study 10 based on the difference between trlfs and batch experiments as cm trlfs returned spectrally observable sorption inner sphere within all ph regions that had also displayed sorption within the batch experiments figs 4 and s4 the spectroscopically derived speciation of cm iii however suggests that outer sphere complexes do contribute to cm s speciation albeit in limited quantities the fit of the sorption raw data to a variety of isotherm models provided a rather consistent picture with reference to the freundlich isotherm results the heterogeneity factor obtained b f 0 48 0 06 is indicative of a monolayer system which is in agreement with the reasonable fit towards the langmuir isotherm model this value for bf is however skewed closer towards a heterogeneous binding mechanism coupled with the variation from the previously determined langmuir sorption constant at a higher ph yan et al 2013 and a high d r free energy of binding 12 3 0 6 kj mol 1 a strong indication for multiple mechanisms is provided this coincides nicely with the independent spectral indication of both inner and outer sphere complexes contributing to this sorption process thus these three isotherm models have all acted in support of assumptions corresponding directly to previous understanding of the muscovite system where multiple species are bound to the surface pan et al 2017 yan et al 2013 although the batch sorption data is generally well reproduced by scm a a comparison to the spectroscopically derived speciation clearly shows that the abundance of the outer sphere sorption complex is greatly overestimated by this model fig 4 consequently an inclusion of spectroscopic information scm b approach led to the identification of one more surface species than dictated within scm a observation of single component cm iii trlfs spectra displayed a discrepancy between inner sphere sorption species and batch sorption edge which was used for the determination of an outer sphere species the deconvoluted single component spectra align well with the spectra previously determined for k feldspar neumann et al 2021a emphasized as they are underlaid within fig 3 alluding to close parallels to the surface speciation between the two alumino silicate mineral phases the formation of a similar surface bound cm iii species 597 599 nm has been noted between ph 4 and 7 for many alumino silicate minerals huittinen et al 2012 neumann et al 2021a schnurr et al 2015 with this species appearing at a higher wavelength 601 nm and at ph 5 for quartz and for alumina minerals kupcik et al 2016 rabung et al 2006 other studies have postulated secondary hydrolysis species 605 607 nm at ph 8 huittinen et al 2012 kupcik et al 2016 neumann et al 2021a rabung et al 2006 and ternary surface complexes 610 nm at ph values of 10 and higher huittinen et al 2012 while neither were observed in appreciable amounts within this study there is the potential for a low abundance 5 of a secondary hydrolysis species sc4 fig s4 also in our system however outside of the experimentally investigated range from spectroscopic data it is observed that inner sphere sorption of cm iii to the surface and the formation of surface bound cm oh 2 coincide this species sc3 swiftly becomes the dominant surface species and remains so throughout the ph region studied this occurs despite the low concentration of aqueous cm oh 2 as would be expected with the inclusion of this data and as has been previously observed neumann et al 2021a the approach taken in scm b results in a model that displays a better agreement with the spectroscopically observed speciation of cm iii while still reproducing the sorption edges with similar accuracy thus it is clear that scm b is significantly closer to reality than scm a although the level of description of total sorption is comparable the extrapolative capability of scm b should be much more dependable to verify that statement independent sets of sorption data have been tested with experimental parameter ranges differing from those in this study 4 1 model validation for the validation of the models two previously reported datasets for sorption of lanthanides nd iii and eu iii to the surface of muscovite flakes were compared with prognostic phreeqc calculations of the currently developed scm utilizing the experimental conditions outlined with each dataset the first of the two datasets is from a doctoral thesis of richter 2015 from this thesis the immobilization of nd iii by a muscovite powder particle size 30 400 µm 10 montmorillonite ssa 0 66 m2 g britz 2018 richter 2015 is plotted as a function of ph and has been directly compared to scm a and scm b from this study in fig 5 scms developed in this work excellently reproduce the data obtained from this thesis in particular for points along the top and middle of the sorption edge above ph 4 5 both models in each case created a reasonable approximation of the edge independent of an iii ln iii ionic strength or slr however it is difficult to make assumptions about the description of the low ph region of each sorption edge this agreement of the model derived from am iii cm iii eu iii data with nd iii sorption data thus not only validates the scm derived here but again reaffirms the robust nature of the analogy between ln iii and an iii exploited here and in many other investigations the eu iii sorption edge of an analogous study comparing the effects of counter ions on the sorption of eu iii to the surface of muscovite by pan et al 2017 has been digitized and is displayed in fig 6 again underlain with the respective phreeqc simulations scm a and scm b in this case however neither scm was capable of describing the data satisfactorily it can be seen that the sorption edge is less steep than predicted by the model this could potentially be caused by the larger site occupancy in the study of pan et al 52 as opposed to the maximum of max 30 studied here which may lead to a higher contribution of outer sphere sorption especially at low ph where the least number of deprotonated sites are available another factor relates to a potential inability for our models to describe a relationship between sorption and ionic strength as the batch sorption experiments only covered one specific ionic strength of 0 1 m this ionic strength was sufficient for the anticipated application cases for crystalline rocks and soils where higher ionic strengths are unlikely to occur however additional experiments would be necessary when dealing with various clay rocks where higher salinity can be expected as well as for crystalline rock layers in immediate contact with salt rocks in such cases a switch from the diffuse double layer scm to a constant capacitance scm may be necessary as the latter one is more suitable for higher salinities hayes et al 1991 5 conclusions here we report the sorption of trivalent europium americium and curium by muscovite mica using a multi method approach consisting of batch sorption experiments trlfs and scm sorption is low 5 up to ph 5 but shows a strong increase up to completion around ph 6 all sorption ph edges can be reproduced adequately with only two surface complexes scm a one outer and one inner sphere species however cm iii trlfs revealed the sorption structure on the molecular level and three sorption species were identified an outer sphere complex 10 at low ph ph 6 an inner sphere complex s o 2m and its subsequent hydrolysis species s o 2moh which form at the same ph the improved thermodynamic model scm b is more realistic and thus more robust with respect to extrapolation beyond the boundary conditions of these experiments as was proven by modeling independent literature data scm b therefore delivers surface complexation parameters cf table 2 that are added to the sorption database of the smart kd concept stockmann et al 2017 sorption isotherms delivered thermodynamic parameters of the sorption reaction and support the modeled binding mechanisms all findings imply great similarities to sorption on k feldspar regarding sorption quantity and structure overall the scm developed within this study will aid in developing transport models for rare earth elements and trivalent actinides in the environment whenever aqueous media play an essential role this is relevant for a broad variety of applications such as safety assessments for nuclear waste repositories where adsorption of trivalent actinides to mobile clay colloids may increase radionuclide transport beyond that the results of this study are also relevant for norm problems associated with geothermal power generation as well as environmental prevention and remediation measures connected to ore mining and milling but also rare earth element

15609,for a safe enclosure of contaminants for instance in deep geological repositories of radioactive waste any processes retarding metal migration are of paramount importance this study focusses on the sorption of trivalent actinides am cm and lanthanides eu to the surface of muscovite a mica and main component of most crystalline rocks granites granodiorites batch sorption experiments quantified the retention regarding parameters like ph varied between 3 and 9 metal concentration from 0 5 µm cm to 10 µm eu or solid to liquid ratio 0 13 and 5 25 g l 1 in addition time resolved laser fluorescence spectroscopy trlfs using the actinide cm iii identified two distinct inner sphere surface species combining both approaches allowed the development of a robust surface complexation model and the determination of stability constants of the spectroscopically identified species of s oh 2m3 logko 8 89 s o 2m logko 4 11 and s o 2moh logko 10 6 with all values extrapolated to infinite dilution the inclusion of these stability constants into thermodynamic databases will improve the prognostic accuracy of lanthanide and actinide transport through groundwater channels in soils and crystalline rock systems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords mica trivalent actinides retardation trlfs diffuse double layer model data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction hazardous waste from a manifold of sources must be confined from the ecosphere and specifically from entering the food chain prominent examples are metal ore mining and processing fertilizer production nuclear power generation geothermics decommissioning of industrial installations and most branches of consumer good production to safely dispose of such contaminants for long periods is a huge challenge and of great societal concern in the case of radioactive waste safe isolation for 1 million years is demanded by german law to be considered in safety assessments nea 2006 engineered barriers are usually expected to fail in their protection functions after thousands of years after which the influx of groundwater will mobilize toxic materials and potentially introduce such species into the water table in case of radioactive waste and with the ability for mineralogical formations to retain mobile species this has led to the consideration of deep geological storage as the most viable option in many countries such as russia japan usa and germany blyth et al 2009 ojovan et al 2019 vokál et al 2010 the selection and characterization of a suitable multi shell encapsulation system including the host rock requires serious consideration to prevent transfer of radionuclides into the ecosphere granitic rock is one such formation bge 2020 laverov et al 2016 oy 2012 yamamoto et al 2013 and consists predominantly of quartz feldspar and mica in varying ratios studies conducted on the immobilization characteristics of complete mineral assemblies will generate information on a specific granite only alterations in composition may however alter performance between samples with mechanistic understanding of the sorbing capabilities of individual mineral phases a more universal approach can be generated further improving predictions for retardation capabilities within complex rock assemblies stockmann et al 2017 minor actinides americium and curium but also plutonium contribute significantly to the total radiotoxicity of spent nuclear fuel and are expected to occur in their trivalent oxidation state under the strongly reducing conditions developing over time in a deep geological repository as pu iii is a big challenge for experimental designs many sorption studies have focused on am iii and cm iii as well as an inactive rare earth analogue eu iii all of them keeping their oxidation state even under oxidizing conditions here interactions with mineral phases such as feldspars neumann et al 2021a stumpf et al 2006b clays hartmann et al 2011 schnurr et al 2015 stumpf et al 2004 and aluminum huittinen et al 2009 and iron oxides stumpf et al 2006a as well as quartz garcía et al 2019 are of highest importance surface complexation models scm for actinide sorption have also been developed for some of these systems in a brief overview quartz was reported to display two distinct adsorbed species s o 2heu between ph 3 5 and 6 and s o 2euoh as ph increases that vary in immobilization contribution dependent on ionic strength garcía et al 2019 feldspar minerals have been reported to display as many as four distinct surface species s oh 2m3 s o 2m s o 2moh and s o 2m oh 2 verified utilizing both scm and spectroscopy neumann et al 2021 stumpf et al 2006b mica minerals such as muscovite as major components of granitic rock have been the focus of several studies investigating their retention potential towards radionuclides some investigations also covered effects of counter ions on sorption of trivalent metal ions lee et al 2013 neumann et al 2022 pan et al 2017 yan et al 2013 of co ions on nano particle formation of tetravalent actinides neumann et al 2021 or speciation on u vi sorption arnold et al 2006 richter et al 2016 most of these studies used large single crystals as substrates however and hence there is still a distinct lack of a fundamental understanding of sorption of trivalent actinides an iii and a realistic set of species required to parametrize respective scms to close gaps in thermodynamic databases richter 2015 with the utilization of µtrlfs sorption of trivalent actinides has been discovered to mainly occur along mineral grain boundaries blyth et al 2009 demnitz et al 2022 molodtsov et al 2021 2019 in natural granite samples including those of the mica mineral fractions muscovite is a mica mineral that is both abundant and chemically analogous to illite and weathering processes of this mineral cause the formation of many other clay minerals and colloidal species jackson et al 1948 for example muscovite is a major component of a variety of soils anand and gilkes 1987 wilson 2004 and also 22 of the mineralogical matrix at the grimsel test site gts degueldre et al 1989 soler and mäder 2010 an underground research laboratory facility in a crystalline rock formation in switzerland used for research projects related to radioactive waste disposal in situ experiments conducted in a fracture zone at the gts showed that transport of trivalent actinides am cm and pu occurred mainly colloid mediated in particular through their adsorption to mobile clay colloids geckeis et al 2004 möri et al 2003 it therefore seems imperative that the behavior of muscovite will be pivotal for an overarching model describing the long term mobility of disposed radio toxic waste compounds hence this work strives for the formulation of a scm for the sorption of an iii ln iii to the surface of muscovite based on a sound molecular level understanding of the interfacial speciation as the data situation with respect to metal cation sorption onto other micas biotite chlorite phlogopite glauconite is similarly disappointing any muscovite sorption model may at least be indicative or serve for scoping calculations also for such systems the information derived from such studies will help improve the accuracy of reactive transport models such as the smart k d concept stockmann et al 2017 which is a modern and robust approach to simulate contaminant transport through complex geochemical systems the premise behind this concept is the computation of distribution coefficients k d values based on sorption equilibria for each relevant ion mineral combination in a comprehensive and competitive manner such calculations exploit the mechanistic understanding casted into validated surface complexation and ion exchange models then it is easy to perform these computations for a wide range of physicochemical parameters generating multidimensional matrices they in turn are used in reactive transport codes for a more reliable prediction of contaminant transport through ground water pathways within the host rock taking into consideration localized geochemical conditions and decreasing the computational costs for each simulation stockmann et al 2017 this study combines sorption experiments ph edges and isotherms with trlfs investigations in the exploration of trivalent actinide am cm and lanthanide eu sorption to the surface of muscovite in a next step scms are generated with and without the implementation of spectroscopically observed species the finally selected species set with respective reaction constants are valuable expansions to thermodynamic databases namely they allow for a more realistic description of actinide immobilization by muscovite e g as a major constituent of granitic rock thus our approach provides robust thermodynamic data based on molecular level speciation derived from spectroscopic investigations due to the use of multiple trivalent actinides and lanthanides the data are nonetheless generic and can be used to describe the interaction of any trivalent f elements with muscovite mica the resulting increased modeling accuracy for long term safety assessments aids in the selection of sites suitable for deep geological storage of radioactive waste 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials for all sorption experiments nacl was purchased from sigma aldrich and hcl and naoh sigma aldrich were used for ph adjustments an 243am stock solution in 0 01 m hcl was diluted for batch contacts a stock solution of 248cm in 1 m hclo4 was diluted for trlfs experiments and eucl3 6h2o 99 9 abcr chemie was used for batch sorption experiments milli q water was produced via

sandwiched between two silicate tetrahedral layers t and a potassium interlayer between sheets as many common phyllosilicate minerals contain a range of transitional metals xfa was used for the determination of the mineral s iron concentration 1 9 table s1 which is relevant for the interpretation of the trlfs results see below the specific surface area ssa 18 1 m2 g 1 was measured using n2 bet analysis quantachrome asiqwin quadrasorb and the surface binding site density ssd 2 61 sites nm 2 was obtained from literature arnold et al 2001 zeta potential measurements of the muscovite powder were conducted by first generating a range of 20 samples with a solid liquid ratio slr of 0 15 g l 1 and nacl of 0 1 m and ph adjustments were conducted by addition of negligible quantities of 1 0 1 or 0 01 m hcl or naoh suspensions were equilibrated over a 48 h period in an end over end agitator before surface charge measurements were taken by zeta potential measurements malvern company zetasizer nano zs respective results are reported within the supplemental information fig s1 2 2 sorption experiments 2 2 1 batch sorption experiments ph edges eu iii batch sorption experiments were conducted by the generation of mineral suspension with an slr of either 1 or 3 g l 1 and metal concentrations of 10 or 0 5 µm eu iii all sorption experiments with eu were performed under atmospheric conditions the investigated metal concentrations represent typical ree concentrations measured for waste water of ree mining sites up to 80 µm and lower grawunder et al 2014 hao et al 2016 merten et al 2005 expected concentrations for trivalent actinides in the vicinity of a nuclear waste repository are significantly lower keesmann et al 2005 zhao et al 2016 the chosen slr and metal concentrations correspond to site occupancies of 18 see section 3 in si for further explanation assuming a bidentate binding mechanism at which surface precipitation is not expected for ph 8 table s2 the background electrolyte concentration was set to 0 1 m nacl to maintain constant ionic strength and the ph of each suspension was altered by addition of negligible quantities of 1 0 1 or 0 01 m naoh or hcl samples were prepared as singlets after ph adjustment suspensions were equilibrated for 48 h by end over end agitation in ambient conditions 25 1 c scoping calculations with phreeqc and the thermochimie tdb version 10a blanc et al 2015 giffaut et al 2014 grivé et al 2015 were performed to estimate the amount of eu potentially transforming into secondary solid phases the maximum eu considered was 10 5 mol l in the ph edge experiments at ph 6 beyond which sorption will reduce the eu content in the aqueous phase significantly here only eu oh 3 am and eu oh co3 0 5h2o were assumed relevant as any formation of well crystalline minerals within only five days and at ambient temperatures is implausible the saturation indices for the two solids were 5 62 and 5 81 respectively therefore no precipitation is expected from a theoretical point of view and indeed no secondary phase formation was observed in any sorption experiment 243am experiments were undertaken in a similar manner slr of 3 g l 1 and am3 of 10 µm but in a nitrogen glovebox for radiation protection reasons and agitation was conducted on an orbital shaker for all sorption samples post contact ph of the suspension was measured prior to centrifugation for 20 min 3 46 g and afterwards three aliquots of the supernatant were taken for analysis of remaining metal concentration via icp ms perkinelmer las nexion 350x displayed error bars represent the standard deviation of the triple icp ms measurement the quantitative information from the cm iii trlfs results was also considered here 2 2 2 sorption isotherm experiments sorption isotherm experiments were conducted in a similar manner to the batch sorption experiments however a static ph ph 7 was decided upon to minimize mineral dissolution and ensure complete uptake of available eu3 90 see fig s3 in si for details deviating from the usual isotherm philosophy eu3 was kept constant at 1 5 µm in order to alleviate concerns of the precipitation of amorphous eu oh 3 or eu oh co3 0 5h2o the respective saturation indices are 3 55 and 0 26 computed as outlined under section 2 2 1 assuming no sorption this would translate into a maximum of about 45 of initial eu being theoretically precipitated as eu oh co3 0 5h2o instead of varying eu the slr was altered between 0 13 and 5 25 g l 1 corresponding to a site occupancy of 0 75 and 50 the minimal slr investigated 0 13 g l 1 provided a maximum of 50 theoretical site occupancy lützenkirchen and behra 1996 also minimizing the risk of surface precipitation mineral suspensions were equilibrated over 48 h in d i water before addition of electrolyte solution and ph equilibration where ph was adjusted as above after ph remained steady over a 24 h period suspensions were spiked with a eu iii stock solution if a ph drift was observed during the reaction time it was adjusted back to the desired ph and contacted until the ph remained stable 0 05 for a minimum of 48 h equilibrated suspensions were centrifuged and analyzed in the same manner as those within the batch sorption experiments sorption isotherm data were fit to three common two parameter models in brief the freundlich model is described by the following equation dada et al 2012 ho et al 2002 1 q e a f c e bf it contains two constants the relative adsorption capacity a f and the heterogeneity factor or intensity of binding b f both unitless dada et al 2012 where a value of 1 alludes to multi layer sorption 0 alludes to irreversible binding and 1 b f 0 describes the homogeneity the higher the value the more heterogeneous potentially displaying multiple bound species with respect to the langmuir isotherm 2 q e q m a l c e 1 a l c e the monolayer sorption equilibrium constant is given by a l l m2 mol 1 and the value of q m mol m 2 relates to the equilibrium sorption capacity ho et al 2002 lastly we applied the dubinin radushkevich d r model ho et al 2002 3 q e q d exp b d rt ln 1 1 c e 2 which describes both the homogeneous binding capacity q d mol m 2 and the energies of binding e kj mol 1 and therefore further mechanistic information b d 4 e 1 2 b d where sorbent sorbate interactions can be elucidated e 8 kj mol 1 equates to physisorption outer sphere sorption van der waals interactions 8 kj mol 1 e 16 kj mol 1 equates to intermediate cases and e 16 kj mol 1 equates to chemisorption inner sphere sorption bulai et al 2009 2 3 time resolved laser induced fluorescence spectroscopy trlfs for structural investigations the actinide cm iii was used as a luminescent probe at a concentration of 0 5 µm at an slr of 3 g l 1 in the ph range 4 5 7 5 the sample preparation was performed within a glove box under nitrogen atmosphere for radiation safety reasons a pulsed 5 8 ns nd yag opo laser system powerlite precision ii 9020 coupled with an opo panther ex opo continuum usa was used for excitation of the sample at the most intense adsorption line 8s7 2 6i11 2 of cm iii at 396 6 nm within a quartz cuvette the luminescence was collected using an optical fiber and transferred to a 300 lines mm grating polychromator andor kymera 328i c and ccd camera istar dh320t 18u 63 a delay between the laser pulse and luminescence measurement of 1 µs was generated dg535 digital delay generator stanford research systems inc for protection of the detector from intense pulses with increasing complexation of cm iii a red shift of the emission band with respect to the cm iii aquo ion 593 8 nm is observed therefore from the spectral deconvolution of emission spectra the cm iii speciation can be obtained with the band positions of single component spectra giving information about their chemical environment with the change in the emission band also a shift of the absorption maximum of each species is observed therefore the efficiency of the luminescence excitation is reduced to deduce the relative abundances of the distinct chemical species their contribution to the overall speciation needs correction by relative fluorescence intensity fi factors edelstein et al 2006 furthermore the lifetime of this luminescence is also highly dependent on the hydration shell of cm iii and with analysis of this lifetime the number of waters within the hydration shell can be determined kimura et al 1996 there are however limitations of this approach to speciation determination the first of which is that both the cm aquo ion and its outer sphere sorption complex will return the same emission spectra as neither species display alteration of the inner hydration sphere the second is that with the presence of transition metals specifically iron in the mineral sample relaxation processes will quench the luminescence by non radiative energy transfer hartmann et al 2008 this quenching process will decrease the reliability of both lifetime analysis and fi calculation fi factors for mineral sorption species can however be calculated from the species band position using the relationship described in eibl et al 2019 2 4 surface complexation modelling scm the determination of the surface complexation parameters was conducted through coupling the geochemical speciation software phreeqc version 3 6 2 15100 charlton and parkhurst 2011 parkhurst and appelo 2013 and the parameter estimation code ucode 2014 version 1 004 poeter et al 2014 a diffuse double layer model was applied dzombak and morel 1990 for aqueous speciation of eu iii cm iii and am iii as well as mineral dissolution thermodynamic data the thermochimie phreeqc tdb version 10a blanc et al 2015 giffaut et al 2014 grivé et al 2015 was used the surface of muscovite was considered to contain one generic functional group surface site s oh with protolysis values pk a taken from literature arnold et al 2001 i e valid at their experimental ionic strength of 0 1 m being identical to the one in this work 5 s oh h s oh 2 pk1 6 06 6 s oh s o h pk2 7 81 an overview of the thermodynamic parameters used in the scm is given in table 2 3 results 3 1 batch sorption experiments 3 1 1 aqueous speciation the aqueous speciation of each system am iii cm iii and eu iii were calculated at experimentally relevant conditions using phreeqc see section 5 in si m3 is the predominant species in all data series up to a ph of 7 5 where it is overtaken by hydrolysis products m oh 2 or m oh 2 between ph 8 5 and 10 m oh 2 is the most dominant species in each case before being overtaken by m oh 3 at ph 10 5 for eu iii as we have limited the ph range to ph 9 the neutral species can thus be neglected the introduction of carbonate changes the speciation slightly especially under alkaline ph conditions with the mco3 complex being dominant for ph 8 8 5 as experiments with am iii were conducted under exclusion of atmospheric co2 any influence of carbonate complexation should be visible as differences between the eu iii and am iii data in this ph range moreover carbonate complexation in solution or as a ternary complex on the muscovite surface should be easily identifiable by cm iii trlfs kim et al 1994 marques fernandes et al 2010 3 1 2 ph edges the sorption data of eu iii and am iii spectroscopically observed cm iii sorption data has been also included are reported on the surface of muscovite flakes 63 µm in order to gain insight into site occupancy effects on the sorption edge two slr 1 and 3 g l 1 and two concentrations eu3 0 5 and 10 µm were investigated with an extension to am iii 10 µm m3 slr of 3 g l 1 and cm iii 0 5 µm m3 slr of 3 g l 1 the percentage immobilization as a function of ph is given in fig 1 eu iii immobilization on muscovite begins at ph 5 and reaches 100 by a ph of 6 5 fig 1 the obtained sorption edges show a small shift towards lower ph with decreasing maximum site occupancy fig 1 left to right one noticeable deviation is observed for the spectroscopically derived cm iii data see below at highest ph values pink symbols in fig 1 right while both am iii and eu iii reach a plateau at 100 immobilization at ph 6 5 the plateau for cm iii begins at the same ph but only reaches 90 immobilization which is likely caused by the presence of 10 outer spherical bound cm this is because it is impossible to distinguish outer sphere complexes from the aquo ion by trlfs due to the lack of changes in the first hydration shell of cm the data for eu iii measured in normal atmosphere and the am iii data measured under n2 atmosphere are identical within the precision of the measurement suggesting no influence of carbonate on the sorption process a confirmation of this assumption on the molecular level will however have to rely on spectroscopic data 3 1 3 sorption isotherms the isotherm data is plotted in fig 2 with q e equilibrium concentration of eu iii adsorbed on the mineral surface mol m 2 as a function of c e equilibrium solution phase concentration of eu iii adjusted for available mineral surface area mol l 1 m2 this data plot is combined with fitted langmuir freundlich and d r isotherms sorption of eu iii to muscovite displays an initially steep isotherm profile indicative of strong sorption beyond a c e of 2 0 10 6 mol m 2 this profile begins to display a gentler slope while not leveling out completely this alteration in isotherm profile is coupled with a slow approach to adsorption saturation of the surface as extraction efficiency decreases from 100 to 90 fig s3 the values generated by fitting the isotherm data to the models cf section 2 2 2 are reported within table 1 the sorption data were reasonably well fit to all three models r2 0 97 the fits to the freundlich isotherm relate to a strong binding mechanism b f of 0 48 leading to the determination that within the site occupancy range studied no surface precipitation or cooperative binding multi layer mechanism was apparent the langmuir model returns an equilibrium sorption capacity q m of 6 7 0 8 10 7 mol m 2 which slightly exceeds the maximum equilibrium concentration of adsorbed eu iii qe on the mineral surface covered by our measurements 6 0 10 7 mol m 2 despite this extrapolation of the experimental data the langmuir model is still a reasonable descriptor of the data at hand in stark contrast the homogeneous binding capacity q d for the d r isotherm is 1 0 0 4 10 5 mol m 2 and is based on a much larger extrapolation of this data see orange curve in fig 2 leading to very tentative reliance on this model in other words the result of our isotherm analysis overestimates the amount of sorption since the homogeneous binding capacity is 2 3 times larger than the total number of available sorption sites according to the ssd used in our scm 2 61 sites nm 2 corresponding to 4 33 10 6 mol m 2 arnold et al 2001 it is possible that a contribution of outer sphere species leads to the high value of qd as outer spherically bound species do not occupy specific sorption sites the e value determined from the d r isotherm model of 12 3 kj mol 1 is in between the typical energies of physisorption and chemisorption which can be interpreted as a combination of both processes consistent with the interpretation of the value for the homogeneous binding capacity in short while details vary between different isotherms all models describe a strong heterogeneous binding mechanism both the freundlich and langmuir isotherms describe a process that occurs in the absence of any precipitation this in conjunction to a high heterogeneity factor and a d r binding energy between physisorption and chemisorption leads to the allusion of multiple reactions causing sorption of eu iii onto the surface of muscovite with these assumptions in mind it can be assumed that there is a combination of both outer sphere physisorption and inner sphere sorption chemisorption mechanisms creating the measured sorption profiles 3 2 time resolved laser induced fluorescence spectroscopy trlfs by trlfs measurement using the luminophore cm iii we are able to gain insight into the speciation and potentially the sorption mechanism of an iii ln iii on muscovite as the position of the 6d7 2 8s7 2 luminescence band shifts depending on the chemical environment of cm iii the peak deconvolution of the measured cm emission spectra enables the identification of the present species and their quantitative contributions to the overall speciation eibl et al 2019 huittinen et al 2012 stumpf et al 2001 with this information further deductions can be made upon the mechanisms of sorption of an iii ln iii the spectra utilized in deconvolution residual spectra after deconvolution and deconvoluted single component spectra are plotted in fig 3 due to the iron content of the muscovite samples table s1 the signal to noise ratio of the emission spectra was relatively low and while lifetimes can be derived from our data they do not contain the structural information with respect to the number of water molecules in the cm s first coordination sphere due to the excess quenching effect of structural fe in addition to the cm iii aquo ion a minimum of two distinct species were required in order to minimize the residual spectra fig 3 left black after deconvolution these species have been assigned as an inner sphere surface complex sc of cm iii sc2 s o 2m peak at 598 nm and its hydrolysis species sc3 s o 2moh peak at 603 nm by referencing similar studies on k feldspar neumann et al 2021a illite montmorillonite schnurr et al 2015 and kaolinite huittinen et al 2012 2010 deconvolution of individual species spectra became difficult due to the simultaneous occurrence of multiple species overall low signal quality as well as a potential small contribution 5 of a fourth species therefore deconvolution was conducted based on single component spectra available in the literature for the sorption of cm iii on another alumino silicate mineral k feldspar neumann et al 2021 these spectra are shown as translucent lines in fig 3 right the peak deconvolution resulted in a quantitative species distribution fig 4 which was corrected by fi values aquo ion 1 0 sc2 0 54 sc3 0 29 neumann et al 2021 the contribution of spectroscopically indistinguishable cm aquo ion outer sphere species sc1 fig 4 left decreases steeply from 100 at ph 5 to 10 at ph 6 from here there is a steady decrease to 5 beyond ph 7 as discussed above complete uptake is observed in batch sorption experiments under identical experimental conditions therefore the observation of a small amount of fully hydrated cm can be interpreted as a constant contribution of outer spherically bound cm to the speciation the species designated sc2 fig 4 middle present from ph 5 and higher is assumed to be analogous to the bidentate inner sphere sorption species reported for the k feldspar s o 2m displaying a gentle onset reaching a relative abundance of 40 at ph 6 parallel to the formation of sc2 its first hydrolysis product s o 2moh sc3 fig 3 right is formed and reaches a maximum relative abundance of 70 by ph 7 being the most abundant of the spectrally observable species there is no evidence of carbonate complex species in solution or on the mineral surface at those ph values where relevant carbonate concentrations would be expected most cm iii has already been adsorbed to the surface consequently dissolved carbonate complexes can only play a minor role and are not observed spectroscopically ternary surface complexes involving carbonate should exhibit larger red shifts 606 nm marques fernandes et al 2010 than were found in our experiments due to the low signal to noise ratio we cannot unambiguously conclude that such species do not form but it appears evident that they are at most minor species under these conditions 3 3 surface complexation modelling scm the surface complexation model was developed utilizing two distinct methods building on each other both models have in common that they postulate bidentate species because the entropic effect should favor the formation of bidentate complexes wang and giammar 2013 the first modeling approach scm a is stepwise increasing the number of surface species in order to both describe the batch sorption data and minimize the total number of surface species it is empirical as it does not take into account specific spectroscopic information consequently scm a was initially attempted with a single surface species increasing the complexity of the system as additional species were included stoichiometry of each species was based upon the aqueous speciation within the ph region of the conducted batch sorption experiments fig s2 the second modeling approach scm b further expands the scm a basis it incorporates spectroscopically observed species in combination with the batch sorption data for the formation of the initial species estimation within the model the comparison of both models to experimental data is shown in fig 1 modeled species and their corresponding log k values are reported in table 2 the nomenclature denotes the level of hydrolysis of sorbed eu iii with sc1 being the potential outer sphere complex not releasing any protons upon formation scm a i e the model without consideration of the spectroscopic data showed that two distinct species were sufficient to describe the experimental batch sorption edges of eu iii and am iii fig 1 these two major species were assigned as a an outer sphere species sc1 dominating the surface speciation until ph 6 fig s6 however when comparing the experimentally observed and simulated contributions of these two species fig 4 it becomes obvious that there are major deviations in particular scm a overestimates dramatically the amount of outer sphere sorption which can be easily seen by the orange line in fig 4 left which displays the sum of cm aquo ion and outer sphere sorption including additional surface complexes within the model led to either the repression of these species to an abundance of zero throughout the fitting or failure of the modeling process to determine a suitable fit at all this behavior illustrates the necessity to provide speciation data derived independent from the modeling process which is why we include the spectroscopically obtained speciation in the next step with the incorporation of the spectroscopically determined speciation i e scm b the upper region of the modeled sorption edge is shifted to slightly lower ph both models were capable of describing both inner and outer sphere surface complexes however considering spectroscopic data scm b also incorporated sc3 see fig 4 purple lines consequently the abundance of sc2 was greatly reduced in place of sc3 4 discussion the sorption edges recorded for am iii cm iii and eu iii overlap with regards to similar suspension conditions reaffirming the assumptions of analogous behavior of an iii ln iii lee et al 2006 while the directly comparable analysis of am iii and eu iii reproduced identical sorption edges there is a slight discrepancy between those of am iii eu iii and cm iii this is caused by the two different experimental approaches and the fact that differentiation between cm aquo ion and outer sphere complexes within the trlfs data is impossible with an inclusion of the spectroscopic data all three site occupancies are well described by the scm the aqueous speciation of each an iii ln iii e g hydrolysis or carbonate complexation fig s2 appears to have little effect on the sorption behavior although spectroscopic data shows that hydrolysis does occur at the interface the transition from m3 to moh2 or mco3 in solution occurs between ph 7 and 8 while sorption in each case begins already at or below ph 5 reaching near completion by ph 6 previous studies have noted sorption occurring earlier and reported contributions by outer sphere sorption at the lower ph values pan et al 2017 yan et al 2013 this feature is less apparent within this study 10 based on the difference between trlfs and batch experiments as cm trlfs returned spectrally observable sorption inner sphere within all ph regions that had also displayed sorption within the batch experiments figs 4 and s4 the spectroscopically derived speciation of cm iii however suggests that outer sphere complexes do contribute to cm s speciation albeit in limited quantities the fit of the sorption raw data to a variety of isotherm models provided a rather consistent picture with reference to the freundlich isotherm results the heterogeneity factor obtained b f 0 48 0 06 is indicative of a monolayer system which is in agreement with the reasonable fit towards the langmuir isotherm model this value for bf is however skewed closer towards a heterogeneous binding mechanism coupled with the variation from the previously determined langmuir sorption constant at a higher ph yan et al 2013 and a high d r free energy of binding 12 3 0 6 kj mol 1 a strong indication for multiple mechanisms is provided this coincides nicely with the independent spectral indication of both inner and outer sphere complexes contributing to this sorption process thus these three isotherm models have all acted in support of assumptions corresponding directly to previous understanding of the muscovite system where multiple species are bound to the surface pan et al 2017 yan et al 2013 although the batch sorption data is generally well reproduced by scm a a comparison to the spectroscopically derived speciation clearly shows that the abundance of the outer sphere sorption complex is greatly overestimated by this model fig 4 consequently an inclusion of spectroscopic information scm b approach led to the identification of one more surface species than dictated within scm a observation of single component cm iii trlfs spectra displayed a discrepancy between inner sphere sorption species and batch sorption edge which was used for the determination of an outer sphere species the deconvoluted single component spectra align well with the spectra previously determined for k feldspar neumann et al 2021a emphasized as they are underlaid within fig 3 alluding to close parallels to the surface speciation between the two alumino silicate mineral phases the formation of a similar surface bound cm iii species 597 599 nm has been noted between ph 4 and 7 for many alumino silicate minerals huittinen et al 2012 neumann et al 2021a schnurr et al 2015 with this species appearing at a higher wavelength 601 nm and at ph 5 for quartz and for alumina minerals kupcik et al 2016 rabung et al 2006 other studies have postulated secondary hydrolysis species 605 607 nm at ph 8 huittinen et al 2012 kupcik et al 2016 neumann et al 2021a rabung et al 2006 and ternary surface complexes 610 nm at ph values of 10 and higher huittinen et al 2012 while neither were observed in appreciable amounts within this study there is the potential for a low abundance 5 of a secondary hydrolysis species sc4 fig s4 also in our system however outside of the experimentally investigated range from spectroscopic data it is observed that inner sphere sorption of cm iii to the surface and the formation of surface bound cm oh 2 coincide this species sc3 swiftly becomes the dominant surface species and remains so throughout the ph region studied this occurs despite the low concentration of aqueous cm oh 2 as would be expected with the inclusion of this data and as has been previously observed neumann et al 2021a the approach taken in scm b results in a model that displays a better agreement with the spectroscopically observed speciation of cm iii while still reproducing the sorption edges with similar accuracy thus it is clear that scm b is significantly closer to reality than scm a although the level of description of total sorption is comparable the extrapolative capability of scm b should be much more dependable to verify that statement independent sets of sorption data have been tested with experimental parameter ranges differing from those in this study 4 1 model validation for the validation of the models two previously reported datasets for sorption of lanthanides nd iii and eu iii to the surface of muscovite flakes were compared with prognostic phreeqc calculations of the currently developed scm utilizing the experimental conditions outlined with each dataset the first of the two datasets is from a doctoral thesis of richter 2015 from this thesis the immobilization of nd iii by a muscovite powder particle size 30 400 µm 10 montmorillonite ssa 0 66 m2 g britz 2018 richter 2015 is plotted as a function of ph and has been directly compared to scm a and scm b from this study in fig 5 scms developed in this work excellently reproduce the data obtained from this thesis in particular for points along the top and middle of the sorption edge above ph 4 5 both models in each case created a reasonable approximation of the edge independent of an iii ln iii ionic strength or slr however it is difficult to make assumptions about the description of the low ph region of each sorption edge this agreement of the model derived from am iii cm iii eu iii data with nd iii sorption data thus not only validates the scm derived here but again reaffirms the robust nature of the analogy between ln iii and an iii exploited here and in many other investigations the eu iii sorption edge of an analogous study comparing the effects of counter ions on the sorption of eu iii to the surface of muscovite by pan et al 2017 has been digitized and is displayed in fig 6 again underlain with the respective phreeqc simulations scm a and scm b in this case however neither scm was capable of describing the data satisfactorily it can be seen that the sorption edge is less steep than predicted by the model this could potentially be caused by the larger site occupancy in the study of pan et al 52 as opposed to the maximum of max 30 studied here which may lead to a higher contribution of outer sphere sorption especially at low ph where the least number of deprotonated sites are available another factor relates to a potential inability for our models to describe a relationship between sorption and ionic strength as the batch sorption experiments only covered one specific ionic strength of 0 1 m this ionic strength was sufficient for the anticipated application cases for crystalline rocks and soils where higher ionic strengths are unlikely to occur however additional experiments would be necessary when dealing with various clay rocks where higher salinity can be expected as well as for crystalline rock layers in immediate contact with salt rocks in such cases a switch from the diffuse double layer scm to a constant capacitance scm may be necessary as the latter one is more suitable for higher salinities hayes et al 1991 5 conclusions here we report the sorption of trivalent europium americium and curium by muscovite mica using a multi method approach consisting of batch sorption experiments trlfs and scm sorption is low 5 up to ph 5 but shows a strong increase up to completion around ph 6 all sorption ph edges can be reproduced adequately with only two surface complexes scm a one outer and one inner sphere species however cm iii trlfs revealed the sorption structure on the molecular level and three sorption species were identified an outer sphere complex 10 at low ph ph 6 an inner sphere complex s o 2m and its subsequent hydrolysis species s o 2moh which form at the same ph the improved thermodynamic model scm b is more realistic and thus more robust with respect to extrapolation beyond the boundary conditions of these experiments as was proven by modeling independent literature data scm b therefore delivers surface complexation parameters cf table 2 that are added to the sorption database of the smart kd concept stockmann et al 2017 sorption isotherms delivered thermodynamic parameters of the sorption reaction and support the modeled binding mechanisms all findings imply great similarities to sorption on k feldspar regarding sorption quantity and structure overall the scm developed within this study will aid in developing transport models for rare earth elements and trivalent actinides in the environment whenever aqueous media play an essential role this is relevant for a broad variety of applications such as safety assessments for nuclear waste repositories where adsorption of trivalent actinides to mobile clay colloids may increase radionuclide transport beyond that the results of this study are also relevant for norm problems associated with geothermal power generation as well as environmental prevention and remediation measures connected to ore mining and milling but also rare earth element
