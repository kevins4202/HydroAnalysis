19700,ionizable antibiotics have attracted serious concerns because of their variable dissociation forms and thereby rendering unique toxicity and microorganism resistance developing an efficient and environmentally friendly method for removing these micropollutants from environmental media remains very challenging here electro assisted adsorption onto activated carbon fiber in continuous flow mode was used to remove three ionizable antibiotics sulfadimethoxine sdm ciprofloxacin cip and clarithromycin cla from water benefiting from strengthened electrostatic interactions the adsorption capacities for the target antibiotics 10 mg l in flow mode 70 9 202 2 mg g increased by 5 times under a potential of 1 0 v sdm or 1 0 v cip and cla relative to those of open circuit oc adsorption meanwhile effluent concentration decreased from 100 μg l to 9 6 μg l with removal efficiency increasing from 99 0 to 99 9 moreover high recovery efficiency of acf up to 96 35 0 65 was achieved by imposing a reverse potential 1 0 v relative to that used for sdm adsorption in addition trace levels of antibiotics 364 580 ng l in surface water could be removed effectively to achieve low effluent concentration 0 4 1 2 ng l and high removal efficiency 99 9 upon treating up to 1560 bed volumes bvs demonstrating the potential of electro assisted adsorption for practical application in water treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords ionizable antibiotics electro assisted adsorption sulfadimethoxine ciprofloxacin clarithromycin continuous flow mode 1 introduction antibiotics have emerged as contaminants of global concern because of their potential effects on human health and natural ecosystems to date approximately 250 antibiotic entities are registered for use kümmerer 2003 and many of these are ionizable ahmed et al 2015 at environmentally relevant ph values wang et al 2015 sun et al 2011 sibley and pedersen 2008 it has been found that the ph dependent dissociations of ionizable antibiotics strongly influences their physicochemical properties wei et al 2013 thereby influencing their toxicity and bioaccumulation in aquatic organisms rendal et al 2011 therefore the environmental risk of these antibiotics has attracted widespread attention and an effective removal technology is highly sought after conventional water treatment techniques incompletely remove or degrade a number of antibiotics pinkston and sedlak 2004 huber et al 2003 advanced oxidation techniques can convert antibiotics into simple compounds or even mineralize the antibiotics but such techniques are usually energy intensive mehrjouei et al 2014 processes using activated sludge appear to eliminate antibiotics effectively but biologically inactive metabolites can be transformed into the active parent compounds increasing the toxicity of effluent and causing negative effects le minh et al 2010 göbel et al 2007 in comparison adsorption is an effective method because of the simplicity of design ease of operation and environmental friendliness ahmaruzzaman 2008 so far approximately 30 antibiotics have been found to be able to be removed from wastewater by adsorption ahmed et al 2015 however the difficulties involved in regenerating adsorbents impede its application in water treatment electrostatic interaction has been proposed as playing a predominant role in adsorption of antibiotics lertpaitoonpan et al 2009 which is commonly controlled by solution ph because of the dual mediation of the dissociated forms of antibiotics and surface chemistry of adsorbents for example the surface charge characteristics of synthetic adsorbents such as activated carbon and carbon nanotubes probably change as ph changes these changes can affect the interactions between ionizable contaminants and the adsorbent e g electrostatic repulsion and electrostatic attraction altering the affinity between contaminant and adsorbent and the removal efficiency achieved in this regard electro assisted adsorption appears to be a promising technique for removing ionizable antibiotics the driving force of electro assisted adsorption includes various interaction between adsorbents and contaminants such as charge and dipole interactions and electrostatic interactions huang and he 2013 applying an external electric field will cause polarized or ionic contaminants in an aqueous solution to move toward the oppositely charged electrode increasing the adsorption rate and adsorption capacity in addition the adsorbent can be regenerated in situ by removing the electric field or reversing the polarities of the electrodes and this can prolong the life of the adsorbent and decrease the operating costs making electro assisted adsorption an attractive practical technique the electro assisted removal of antibiotics has only been described in one previous publication yang et al 2015 the factors influencing the process e g the dissociated contaminant species and the surface chemistry of the adsorbent and regeneration of the adsorbent were not investigated in that study even though such information would be useful for practical treatment of water by electro assisted adsorption in the study presented here we propose a strategy for efficiently removing ionizable antibiotics from water by adsorption to activated carbon fibers acf under electrochemical assistance we also propose a way of regenerating the adsorbent in situ three commonly used antibiotics sulfadimethoxine sdm ciprofloxacin cip and clarithromycin cla were used as target compounds the adsorption characteristics of the target compounds were investigated applying different potentials and under open circuit oc condition in batch flow and continuous flow modes the effects of the potential applied and solution characteristics e g the ph on adsorption capacities were assessed and attempts were made to regenerate the acf in situ to explore its cyclic utilization the adsorption mechanisms involved were identified from the experimental results furthermore removal of trace antibiotics from surface water was probed in continuous flow mode and its energy consumption was calculated in order to evaluate the practical applicability in water treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials pristine acf purchased from jiangsu kejing carbon fiber co jiangsu china were pretreated using a method described in the supporting information si the physicochemical characteristics of the treated acf are shown in table s1 sdm 98 pure cip 98 pure and cla 98 pure were purchased from tokyo chemical industry co tokyo japan the molecular structures and physicochemical properties of sdm cip and cla are shown in table 1 the aqueous solutions used in the continuous flow system were prepared using tap water that had a conductivity of 58 6 μs cm stock standard solutions of the target compounds were prepared by dissolving appropriate amounts of the solid compounds in methanol for sdm and cip or ethanol for cla and the standards were stored at 4 c 2 2 electro assisted adsorption experiments in batch flow mode the effects of changing the polarization potential on adsorption were investigated by performing batch adsorption experiments in a continuous recycling system shown in fig s1 the system components and dimensions are described in detail in the si a sdm cip or cla solution 50 mg l containing 1 mm na2so4 was pumped into the acf unit cell at a flow rate of 3 m h and the effluent was returned to the feed tank with the solution volume of 4 0 l the system was kept at 298 k and the solution had an initial ph of 6 8 experiments were run using the applied cell voltages of 0 6 1 0 0 6 and 1 0 v between anode and cathode the effects of changing the ph on adsorption were investigated by performing experiments at ph values between 1 and 12 using an applied voltage of 1 0 v for sdm and 1 0 v for cip and cla and then the results were compared with the results found using an oc system the adsorption distribution coefficient k d was used to describe the proportions of a chemical adsorbed to the solid phase and remaining in the aqueous solution reaching adsorption equilibrium which was calculated at the initial contaminant concentration of 50 mg l 2 3 electro assisted adsorption desorption in continuous flow mode a magnified acf electro assisted adsorption desorption system was used in continuous flow mode fig 1 two pieces of acf 200 mm long but with different thicknesses were rolled and fitted tightly into a stainless steel tube 50 mm internal diameter 200 mm long the thicker piece 3 mm thick 14 g in weight was defined as anode and the thinner piece 1 mm thick 4 6 g in weight was defined as cathode a glass fiber mesh 3 mm thick was used as an insulating layer the influent containing the target contaminant of 10 mg l and 1 mm na2so4 was pumped upward at 0 6 m h the contaminant was adsorbed by acf with a potential of between 1 0 and 1 0 v applied the effluent was collected and analyzed at regular time intervals during each experiment regeneration experiments were performed once the acf have become saturated taking sdm desorption as an example the opposite potential 1 0 v to that used in adsorption experiment was applied and water free of sdm was pumped downward through acf adsorption unit at 60 m h fig 1 the sdm concentration in the effluent was determined at specified time intervals until desorption equilibrium had been reached electro assisted adsorption tests using fresh standard solutions followed by electro assisted desorption tests were performed multiple times desorption experiments without electro assistance were performed under the same conditions for comparison 2 4 collection and pretreatment of surface water a surface water sample was collected from a reservoir near dalian city and transferred to the laboratory within 2 h the sample was left overnight to allow the suspended solids to settle the supernatant was pumped into a continuous flow system at 0 6 m h with a potential of 1 0 or 1 0 v applied the water sample was collected following the chinese standard procedure gbt 5750 2 2006 influent and effluent samples were analyzed by off line solid phase extraction followed by high performance liquid chromatography electrospray tandem mass spectrometry hplc ms ms the solid phase extraction and quantification methods are described in the si 2 5 characterization and analysis the morphology of pretreated acf was observed using a hitachi s 4800 scanning electron microscope hitachi high technologies tokyo japan the acf specific surface area sbet average pore diameter daverage and pore volume were calculated from n2 adsorption desorption isotherms acquired at 77 k multi point bet and bjh methods respectively the surface elemental compositions were acquired using an x ray photoelectron spectroscopy instrument thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa cyclic voltammetry cv measurements were made at a rate of 50 mv s to explore the electrochemical properties of the contaminants and stability of acf during adsorption process by a princeton electrochemical workstation ch instruments model 660d ametek berwyn pa usa the point of zero charge phpzc of acf electrode at which the net charge on acf was zero was measured following a previously published method milonjić et al 1975 that is described in the si infra red spectra of acf and the target antibiotics were acquired using a ft ir spectrometer shimadzu kyoto japan the sdm cip and cla concentrations in electro assisted adsorption experiments were determined by hplc and hplc ms ms using methods described in the si 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the acf electrodes the sem images of the acf showed smooth and uniform morphology fig s2 indicating that the pretreatment had removed most of the impurities from pristine acf the average fiber diameter was determined to be 2 7 μm the acf sbet value determined from the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms was 1499 m2 g fig s3 the average pore diameter calculated from the pore distribution curve was 2 61 nm fig s3 a n2 adsorption saturation was almost achieved at a low relative pressure p p0 0 1 fig s3 b suggesting the presence of a microporous structure in acf a weak n2 hysteresis loop was found at p p0 0 4 indicating that mesopores were present si et al 2012 the microporous vmicro and mesoporous vmeso volumes were calculated using the t plot method and were 0 72 and 0 26 cm3 g respectively micropores therefore contributed most of the surface area the ir spectrum of pretreated acf is shown in fig s4 a band at 3455 cm 1 was attributed to oh stretching a shoulder peak at 3132 cm 1 was attributed to c h stretching bands at 1670 and 1103 cm 1 were assigned to stretching of c o and c o bonds in aromatic rings respectively no redox peaks were found in cv results for acf and the antibiotics fig s5 confirming that the applied potential did not alter acf porosity or surface chemistry and that the antibiotics were stable to an applied potential of 1 2 v the phpzc value for acf electrode shown in the si determined in batch equilibrium experiments was 6 4 as shown in fig s6 it means that acf surfaces were positively charged at ph phpzc and negatively charged at ph phpzc 3 2 potential dependence of electro assisted adsorption the effects of polarization potential were investigated by performing a series of adsorption experiments using an oc and polarized acf at 1 0 0 6 0 6 and 0 6 v in batch flow mode as shown in fig 2 applying a potential positive or negative to acf decreased the concentration c e of each test compound and increased the removal efficiency to 1 2 3 9 times compared to that achieved using an oc see table s2 the removal efficiency for sdm adsorption was sequenced as 1 0 v 0 6 v 0 6 v 1 0 v oc and a sequence of 1 0 v 0 6 v 0 6 v 1 0 v oc was obtained for both cip and cla adsorption we assumed that using acf as both anode and cathode in electro assisted system would increase the removal efficiency when the system was polarized for example sdm is the dominant species at ph 6 8 and electrostatic attraction between sdm and acf anode increased the removal efficiency when a positive potential applied once a potential of 0 6 v or 1 0 v applied electrostatic repulsion between sdm and acf anode occurred however adsorption still enhanced relative to the oc condition because of the electrostatic attraction between sdm and acf cathode despite the cathode being thinner than the anode li et al 2014 porada et al 2012 similar behaviors were found for both cip and cla which form cip and cla respectively at ph 6 8 using two acf electrodes in one cell is therefore an efficient way of achieving a high removal efficiency 3 3 effect of the ph according to the dependence correlation of adsorption on polarizing potential described above the solution ph should have strongly affected the adsorption of ionizable contaminants because of their ph dependent species figs s7 and s8 the relationships between adsorption distribution coefficients k d described in the si and ph were therefore assessed fig 3 the maximum k d values using an oc were found at ph 6 1 7 4 and 8 0 for sdm cip and cla respectively applying a potential of 1 0 v caused the sdm k d to increase at ph 6 1 because of the electrostatic attraction between sdm and the acf anode for cip the electrostatic attraction between cip2 and the deprotonated acf surface on the anode causes the increase of k d at 1 0 v however at ph 3 5 cip3 becomes the dominant cationic species which is more hydrophilic than its bivalent counterpart wu et al 2010 increased hydrophilicity results in a lower k d value teixido et al 2011 li et al 2013 the combined effects of the electrostatic interactions and hydrophilicity caused the maximum k d to be found at ph 3 for cla the electrostatic attraction is dominant at ph 8 99 under a potential of 1 0 v presenting a higher k d relative to that in alkaline solution on the other hand the decrease of k d at ph 6 was proposed to be caused by enhanced competition between the adsorption of cla and h on the negatively charged acf surface sibley and pedersen 2008 3 4 removal of the antibiotics in continuous flow mode it has been suggested that continuous flow rather than a batch mode could provide more insight into contaminant adsorption because packed bed systems are widely used in industrial treatments zuo et al 2016 a continuous flow system was therefore used to investigate adsorption the contaminant concentrations in effluent c t at different bed volumes bvs when electrochemical assistance was used are shown in fig 4 the adsorption capacity was determined by integrating the effluent concentration bv curve table 2 for sdm adsorption using an oc the sdm concentration in effluent for the first 60 bvs c 0 was 100 4 μg l fig 4 insert indicating that 99 of sdm adsorbed to the acf applying a potential of 0 6 or 1 0 v caused c 0 to decrease to 9 8 μg l acquiring increased removal efficiency of 99 9 and the effluent quality improved dramatically in addition adsorption capacities of 146 1 and 202 2 mg g were found at 0 6 and 1 0 v respectively when contaminant breakthrough defined in the si occurred at 582 and 771 bvs respectively these adsorption capacities were four times higher than the adsorption capacities achieved using an oc similarly the initial cip and cla effluent concentrations at 0 6 and 1 0 v were one tenth of the effluent concentrations found using an oc and the adsorption capacities were 3 2 5 4 times higher than were found using an oc as shown in table 2 the q m values for the antibiotics decreased in the order sdm cip cla either by adsorption under the oc condition or under an optimized potential sdm and cip are polar aromatic compounds so π electron polarization electrostatic interactions and hydrophobic interactions presumably make important contributions to sdm and cip adsorption by acf yang et al 2006 bayram and ayranci 2012 the q m values for sdm and cip were therefore not very different cla is a bulky non planar aliphatic hydrocarbon table 1 and molecular sieving will make a strong contribution to its low acf adsorption capacity the functional groups s o c o oh and cooh of the antibiotics could form hydrogen bonds with polar moieties oh and c o on the acf as shown in fig s4 however steric hindrance would have weakened these interactions for cla because of the size of cla molecule awan et al 1995 3 5 in situ regeneration of acf recovering used adsorbents is crucial to the practical use of adsorption process because the feasibility of an industrial adsorption process depends largely on the cost of regenerating the spent adsorbent ahmed et al 2015 it has been found that adsorbents can be successfully regenerated in situ by releasing adsorbed contaminants through electro assisted desorption fan et al 2015 the sdm desorption efficiency for spent acf was investigated using an applied potential of 1 0 v the sdm concentrations in effluent from different electro assisted adsorption desorption cycles are shown in fig 5 initially sdm breakthrough occurred at 774 bvs when the system was used with an applied potential of 1 0 v backwashing at a flow rate of 60 m h was then performed using an applied potential of 1 0 v the adsorption and desorption capacities for each cycle were determined by integrating the effluent concentration bv graph fig 5 the results indicated that a regeneration efficiency of 96 35 0 65 was achieved and that sdm could be effectively desorbed from the adsorbent table 3 it is possible that diffusion of the contaminant toward acf surface on the counter electrode was impeded after the contaminant released from the working electrode at the high flow rate that was used resulting in the contaminant being successfully desorbed as shown in table 3 the adsorption capacity of acf for sdm in the fifth cycle was 172 7 mg g which was 83 6 of the adsorption capacity in the first cycle in comparison a lower recovery efficiency 27 was achieved after three backwashing cycles without electrochemical assistance table 3 these results indicate that applying a low potential 1 0 v at a high washing rate will give a high acf regeneration efficiency and allow the continuous flow system to be reused multiple times with an acceptable antibiotic adsorption capacity frank et al 2015 3 6 removal of the antibiotics from reservoir water electro assisted adsorption of the target antibiotics from surface water was investigated by collecting reservoir water and pumping it through the continuous flow system the properties of the reservoir water used in the experiments ph dissolved organic carbon doc content and conductivity are shown in table s3 the sdm cip and cla concentrations in the reservoir water were 580 390 and 364 ng l respectively the bv dependent effluent concentration curves using an oc and using an applied potential of 1 0 v are shown in fig 6 similar trends in electro assisted enhancement of adsorption were found as that in the experiments using tap water the initial sdm cip and cla concentrations in effluent when an oc was used were 8 0 5 0 and 4 0 ng l respectively and the concentrations decreased to 0 9 1 2 and 0 4 ng l respectively table s4 when a potential of 1 0 v was applied indicating that electro assistance increased the removal efficiency the adsorption capacities were also increased by electro assistance the breakthrough bvs for the antibiotics being 2 3 6 2 times higher when a potential of 1 0 v was applied than when an oc was used table s4 as shown in table s4 the adsorption capacities q m for sdm cip and cla at breakthrough were 12 4 4 8 and 1 6 μg g respectively when an oc was used and the q m values for each compound increased under a potential of 1 0 v sdm and sdm were the dominant sdm species at ph 7 2 applying a positive potential of 1 0 v caused sdm to move toward the anode through electrostatic attraction enhancing the adsorption of sdm for cip and cla cip and cla were dominant species respectively they would move toward the cathode when a potential of 1 0 v was applied and competed for the adsorption sites on acf cathode the adsorption capacity was higher for cip than for cla because of the combined influences of π π interactions electrostatic interactions and molecular sieving the adsorption capacities for the target antibiotics in reservoir water were lower than the adsorption capacities for the antibiotics in tap water and similar breakthrough bvs of 1782 1890 were found for all three chemicals under a potential of 1 0 v table s4 this may be caused by doc competing for adsorption sites and blocking pores li et al 2002 doc is a complex mixture of humic acids carbohydrates and small molecules ding et al 2008 in the tested water the major components i e humic acid and trace organic compounds such as pesticides and antibiotics were detected by 3d fluorescence spectroscopy and hplc ms ms see figs s9 and s10 and tables s5 and s6 the doc concentration 7 23 mg l was about four orders of magnitude higher than the concentrations of the target antibiotics shown in table s4 so doc could have competitively occupied the mesopore sites of acf ivancev tumbas 2014 decreasing the adsorption capacities for the antibiotics in addition the contaminant breakthrough times decreased in the order doc sdm cip cla as shown in table s4 some of the micropore sites were still available to small doc molecules when the target antibiotics reached adsorption saturation so doc had a longer breakthrough time despite competitive adsorption with doc the adsorption capacities for the three antibiotics at 1 0 v were 2 3 10 6 times higher than when an oc was used table s4 and the removal efficiency increased from 99 0 to 99 9 this suggests that electro assisted adsorption is an effective method of removing trace pollutants from surface water the doc breakthrough bv when a potential of 1 0 v was applied 1908 bvs was twice the breakthrough bv when an oc was used table s4 indicating that electro assistance also increased the adsorption capacity for doc 3 7 energy consumption energy consumption is of great concern when using electro assisted adsorption to treat water the electrochemical assistance applied to the system described here consumed 4 3 10 3 kw h m3 the calculation method is presented in si the energy was used to polarize the adsorbent but not for redox reactions compared with the overall electric consumption of the continuous flow adsorption process 0 72 kw h m3 electrochemical assistance required little additional energy 1 of the total used however electrochemical assistance increased the adsorption capacity dramatically by 4 4 5 4 times compared with using an oc table 2 the performance and energy efficiency indicated that the electro assisted adsorption has great potential for the effective removal of micropollutants from surface water 4 conclusions electro assisted adsorption of sdm cip and cla by acf gave high adsorption capacities in continuous flow mode compared with oc adsorption the increases in adsorption capacity 5 fold and bed volume 3 fold were observed under low potentials of 1 0 v and 1 0 v respectively the in situ regeneration of acf gave a high recovery efficiency 96 after five cycles and sdm adsorption capacity in the fifth cycle was 83 6 of the capacity in the first cycle the removal efficiencies for all three antibiotics in real surface water were 99 9 for 1560 bvs the good performance of the electro assisted adsorption system was attributed to enhanced electrostatic interactions between the contaminants and the adsorbent the results of this study are expected to be useful for improving the designs of electro assisted adsorption systems and the practical application of electro assisted adsorption systems in practical water treatment acknowledgements this work was supported by national natural science foundation of china 21590813 and 21407019 and the programme of introducing talents

was almost achieved at a low relative pressure p p0 0 1 fig s3 b suggesting the presence of a microporous structure in acf a weak n2 hysteresis loop was found at p p0 0 4 indicating that mesopores were present si et al 2012 the microporous vmicro and mesoporous vmeso volumes were calculated using the t plot method and were 0 72 and 0 26 cm3 g respectively micropores therefore contributed most of the surface area the ir spectrum of pretreated acf is shown in fig s4 a band at 3455 cm 1 was attributed to oh stretching a shoulder peak at 3132 cm 1 was attributed to c h stretching bands at 1670 and 1103 cm 1 were assigned to stretching of c o and c o bonds in aromatic rings respectively no redox peaks were found in cv results for acf and the antibiotics fig s5 confirming that the applied potential did not alter acf porosity or surface chemistry and that the antibiotics were stable to an applied potential of 1 2 v the phpzc value for acf electrode shown in the si determined in batch equilibrium experiments was 6 4 as shown in fig s6 it means that acf surfaces were positively charged at ph phpzc and negatively charged at ph phpzc 3 2 potential dependence of electro assisted adsorption the effects of polarization potential were investigated by performing a series of adsorption experiments using an oc and polarized acf at 1 0 0 6 0 6 and 0 6 v in batch flow mode as shown in fig 2 applying a potential positive or negative to acf decreased the concentration c e of each test compound and increased the removal efficiency to 1 2 3 9 times compared to that achieved using an oc see table s2 the removal efficiency for sdm adsorption was sequenced as 1 0 v 0 6 v 0 6 v 1 0 v oc and a sequence of 1 0 v 0 6 v 0 6 v 1 0 v oc was obtained for both cip and cla adsorption we assumed that using acf as both anode and cathode in electro assisted system would increase the removal efficiency when the system was polarized for example sdm is the dominant species at ph 6 8 and electrostatic attraction between sdm and acf anode increased the removal efficiency when a positive potential applied once a potential of 0 6 v or 1 0 v applied electrostatic repulsion between sdm and acf anode occurred however adsorption still enhanced relative to the oc condition because of the electrostatic attraction between sdm and acf cathode despite the cathode being thinner than the anode li et al 2014 porada et al 2012 similar behaviors were found for both cip and cla which form cip and cla respectively at ph 6 8 using two acf electrodes in one cell is therefore an efficient way of achieving a high removal efficiency 3 3 effect of the ph according to the dependence correlation of adsorption on polarizing potential described above the solution ph should have strongly affected the adsorption of ionizable contaminants because of their ph dependent species figs s7 and s8 the relationships between adsorption distribution coefficients k d described in the si and ph were therefore assessed fig 3 the maximum k d values using an oc were found at ph 6 1 7 4 and 8 0 for sdm cip and cla respectively applying a potential of 1 0 v caused the sdm k d to increase at ph 6 1 because of the electrostatic attraction between sdm and the acf anode for cip the electrostatic attraction between cip2 and the deprotonated acf surface on the anode causes the increase of k d at 1 0 v however at ph 3 5 cip3 becomes the dominant cationic species which is more hydrophilic than its bivalent counterpart wu et al 2010 increased hydrophilicity results in a lower k d value teixido et al 2011 li et al 2013 the combined effects of the electrostatic interactions and hydrophilicity caused the maximum k d to be found at ph 3 for cla the electrostatic attraction is dominant at ph 8 99 under a potential of 1 0 v presenting a higher k d relative to that in alkaline solution on the other hand the decrease of k d at ph 6 was proposed to be caused by enhanced competition between the adsorption of cla and h on the negatively charged acf surface sibley and pedersen 2008 3 4 removal of the antibiotics in continuous flow mode it has been suggested that continuous flow rather than a batch mode could provide more insight into contaminant adsorption because packed bed systems are widely used in industrial treatments zuo et al 2016 a continuous flow system was therefore used to investigate adsorption the contaminant concentrations in effluent c t at different bed volumes bvs when electrochemical assistance was used are shown in fig 4 the adsorption capacity was determined by integrating the effluent concentration bv curve table 2 for sdm adsorption using an oc the sdm concentration in effluent for the first 60 bvs c 0 was 100 4 μg l fig 4 insert indicating that 99 of sdm adsorbed to the acf applying a potential of 0 6 or 1 0 v caused c 0 to decrease to 9 8 μg l acquiring increased removal efficiency of 99 9 and the effluent quality improved dramatically in addition adsorption capacities of 146 1 and 202 2 mg g were found at 0 6 and 1 0 v respectively when contaminant breakthrough defined in the si occurred at 582 and 771 bvs respectively these adsorption capacities were four times higher than the adsorption capacities achieved using an oc similarly the initial cip and cla effluent concentrations at 0 6 and 1 0 v were one tenth of the effluent concentrations found using an oc and the adsorption capacities were 3 2 5 4 times higher than were found using an oc as shown in table 2 the q m values for the antibiotics decreased in the order sdm cip cla either by adsorption under the oc condition or under an optimized potential sdm and cip are polar aromatic compounds so π electron polarization electrostatic interactions and hydrophobic interactions presumably make important contributions to sdm and cip adsorption by acf yang et al 2006 bayram and ayranci 2012 the q m values for sdm and cip were therefore not very different cla is a bulky non planar aliphatic hydrocarbon table 1 and molecular sieving will make a strong contribution to its low acf adsorption capacity the functional groups s o c o oh and cooh of the antibiotics could form hydrogen bonds with polar moieties oh and c o on the acf as shown in fig s4 however steric hindrance would have weakened these interactions for cla because of the size of cla molecule awan et al 1995 3 5 in situ regeneration of acf recovering used adsorbents is crucial to the practical use of adsorption process because the feasibility of an industrial adsorption process depends largely on the cost of regenerating the spent adsorbent ahmed et al 2015 it has been found that adsorbents can be successfully regenerated in situ by releasing adsorbed contaminants through electro assisted desorption fan et al 2015 the sdm desorption efficiency for spent acf was investigated using an applied potential of 1 0 v the sdm concentrations in effluent from different electro assisted adsorption desorption cycles are shown in fig 5 initially sdm breakthrough occurred at 774 bvs when the system was used with an applied potential of 1 0 v backwashing at a flow rate of 60 m h was then performed using an applied potential of 1 0 v the adsorption and desorption capacities for each cycle were determined by integrating the effluent concentration bv graph fig 5 the results indicated that a regeneration efficiency of 96 35 0 65 was achieved and that sdm could be effectively desorbed from the adsorbent table 3 it is possible that diffusion of the contaminant toward acf surface on the counter electrode was impeded after the contaminant released from the working electrode at the high flow rate that was used resulting in the contaminant being successfully desorbed as shown in table 3 the adsorption capacity of acf for sdm in the fifth cycle was 172 7 mg g which was 83 6 of the adsorption capacity in the first cycle in comparison a lower recovery efficiency 27 was achieved after three backwashing cycles without electrochemical assistance table 3 these results indicate that applying a low potential 1 0 v at a high washing rate will give a high acf regeneration efficiency and allow the continuous flow system to be reused multiple times with an acceptable antibiotic adsorption capacity frank et al 2015 3 6 removal of the antibiotics from reservoir water electro assisted adsorption of the target antibiotics from surface water was investigated by collecting reservoir water and pumping it through the continuous flow system the properties of the reservoir water used in the experiments ph dissolved organic carbon doc content and conductivity are shown in table s3 the sdm cip and cla concentrations in the reservoir water were 580 390 and 364 ng l respectively the bv dependent effluent concentration curves using an oc and using an applied potential of 1 0 v are shown in fig 6 similar trends in electro assisted enhancement of adsorption were found as that in the experiments using tap water the initial sdm cip and cla concentrations in effluent when an oc was used were 8 0 5 0 and 4 0 ng l respectively and the concentrations decreased to 0 9 1 2 and 0 4 ng l respectively table s4 when a potential of 1 0 v was applied indicating that electro assistance increased the removal efficiency the adsorption capacities were also increased by electro assistance the breakthrough bvs for the antibiotics being 2 3 6 2 times higher when a potential of 1 0 v was applied than when an oc was used table s4 as shown in table s4 the adsorption capacities q m for sdm cip and cla at breakthrough were 12 4 4 8 and 1 6 μg g respectively when an oc was used and the q m values for each compound increased under a potential of 1 0 v sdm and sdm were the dominant sdm species at ph 7 2 applying a positive potential of 1 0 v caused sdm to move toward the anode through electrostatic attraction enhancing the adsorption of sdm for cip and cla cip and cla were dominant species respectively they would move toward the cathode when a potential of 1 0 v was applied and competed for the adsorption sites on acf cathode the adsorption capacity was higher for cip than for cla because of the combined influences of π π interactions electrostatic interactions and molecular sieving the adsorption capacities for the target antibiotics in reservoir water were lower than the adsorption capacities for the antibiotics in tap water and similar breakthrough bvs of 1782 1890 were found for all three chemicals under a potential of 1 0 v table s4 this may be caused by doc competing for adsorption sites and blocking pores li et al 2002 doc is a complex mixture of humic acids carbohydrates and small molecules ding et al 2008 in the tested water the major components i e humic acid and trace organic compounds such as pesticides and antibiotics were detected by 3d fluorescence spectroscopy and hplc ms ms see figs s9 and s10 and tables s5 and s6 the doc concentration 7 23 mg l was about four orders of magnitude higher than the concentrations of the target antibiotics shown in table s4 so doc could have competitively occupied the mesopore sites of acf ivancev tumbas 2014 decreasing the adsorption capacities for the antibiotics in addition the contaminant breakthrough times decreased in the order doc sdm cip cla as shown in table s4 some of the micropore sites were still available to small doc molecules when the target antibiotics reached adsorption saturation so doc had a longer breakthrough time despite competitive adsorption with doc the adsorption capacities for the three antibiotics at 1 0 v were 2 3 10 6 times higher than when an oc was used table s4 and the removal efficiency increased from 99 0 to 99 9 this suggests that electro assisted adsorption is an effective method of removing trace pollutants from surface water the doc breakthrough bv when a potential of 1 0 v was applied 1908 bvs was twice the breakthrough bv when an oc was used table s4 indicating that electro assistance also increased the adsorption capacity for doc 3 7 energy consumption energy consumption is of great concern when using electro assisted adsorption to treat water the electrochemical assistance applied to the system described here consumed 4 3 10 3 kw h m3 the calculation method is presented in si the energy was used to polarize the adsorbent but not for redox reactions compared with the overall electric consumption of the continuous flow adsorption process 0 72 kw h m3 electrochemical assistance required little additional energy 1 of the total used however electrochemical assistance increased the adsorption capacity dramatically by 4 4 5 4 times compared with using an oc table 2 the performance and energy efficiency indicated that the electro assisted adsorption has great potential for the effective removal of micropollutants from surface water 4 conclusions electro assisted adsorption of sdm cip and cla by acf gave high adsorption capacities in continuous flow mode compared with oc adsorption the increases in adsorption capacity 5 fold and bed volume 3 fold were observed under low potentials of 1 0 v and 1 0 v respectively the in situ regeneration of acf gave a high recovery efficiency 96 after five cycles and sdm adsorption capacity in the fifth cycle was 83 6 of the capacity in the first cycle the removal efficiencies for all three antibiotics in real surface water were 99 9 for 1560 bvs the good performance of the electro assisted adsorption system was attributed to enhanced electrostatic interactions between the contaminants and the adsorbent the results of this study are expected to be useful for improving the designs of electro assisted adsorption systems and the practical application of electro assisted

19701,ozonation can be applied to mitigate the discharge of organic micropollutants from municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps to the aquatic environment the toxicity of metals also present in wwtp effluents strongly depends on their speciation therefore knowledge on the change of the metal speciation during ozonation of a wwtp effluent is essential to assess possible negative impacts the kinetics and the stoichiometries of the reactions of ozone with three metal sulfides zns cus and cds and metal ethylenediaminetetraacetate edta nitriloriacetic acid nta complexes of cu ii cd ii ni ii zn ii mg ii and pb ii were investigated with a stoichiometric factor of 2 6 3 9 moles of ozone per mole of sulfide and apparent second order rate constants at ph 8 104 m 1 s 1 a complete oxidation of the sulfides and a concomitant release of the respective metals is expected during ozonation of a wwtp effluent for enhanced micropollutant abatement the apparent second order rate constants at ph 8 for the reactions of metal edta complexes with ozone ranged from 42 m 1s 1 to 2 0 104 m 1s 1 and increased in the order cd ii cu ii mg ii ni ii zn ii approximately 40 of cd ii edta spiked to a wwtp effluent was oxidized at typical specific ozone doses of 0 5 0 7 go3 gdoc for the other metal edta complexes a significantly higher fraction was oxidized the bioavailable fraction determined by the diffusive gradient thin films dgt method in the wwtp effluent increased during ozonation due to the oxidative release of the metal ions algal toxicity chlamynomodas reinhardtii tests with cus cds spiked wwtp effluent revealed a high tolerance toward cu and cd in the respective media a toxic response was only observed at cu concentrations above 10 μm which is above typical wwtp effluent concentrations biological post treatment after ozonation generally reduced the bioavailability of the metals which resulted in a lower toxicity therefore the biological post treatment serves as an additional barrier to protect the downstream ecology of receiving waters graphical abstract image 1 keywords wastewater treatment ozonation metal sulfides metal complexes kinetics speciation 1 introduction conventional wastewater treatment plants wwtps are designed to protect the aquatic environment by reducing the load of nutrients organic matter and pathogens discharged to surface waters however micropollutants are only partially removed by biological wastewater treatment joss et al 2008 stamm et al 2015 ternes and joss 2007 possibly causing adverse effects on the aquatic ecosystems downstream of wwtps e g feminization of fish schwarzenbach et al 2006 to mitigate these micropollutants various additional treatment steps were evaluated most importantly ozonation and powdered granular activated carbon pac gac joss et al 2008 ternes et al 2003 for both ozone and pac pilot and full scale facilities are operational bourgin et al 2018 hollender et al 2009 huber et al 2005 margot et al 2013 zimmermann et al 2011 to reduce the total load of micropollutant discharge to the receiving waters by 50 it has been decided to upgrade 100 wwtps in switzerland with enhanced treatment including ozonation biological post treatment or powdered activated carbon granular activated carbon eggen et al 2014 besides the mitigation of micropollutants ozonation leads to a disinfection of the effluent czekalski et al 2016 zimmermann et al 2011 has a smaller footprint requires lower maintenance and lower costs compared to pac systems abegglen et al 2011 however the formation of potentially harmful oxidation disinfection by products e g ndma bromate may limit the application of ozonation for certain wastewaters schindler wildhaber et al 2015 soltermann et al 2016 2017 to remove undesired organic oxidation by products formed from the organic matrix a downstream biological post treatment rapid sand filtration is commonly installed to mitigate toxicity to certain organisms prasse et al 2015 stalter et al 2010a 2010b nevertheless prior to the installation of an ozonation the wwtp effluent has to be tested for its treatability to avoid impacts on the downstream ecology schindler wildhaber et al 2015 the formation of transformation products compromising the quality of the treated wastewater is mainly discussed in the context of organic micropollutants hübner et al 2015 lee and von gunten 2016 but ozone induced changes in metal speciation may also impact the quality of the treated wastewater thalmann et al 2015 in wwtp effluents transition metals are present either as precipitates e g oxides carbonates sulfides karvelas et al 2003 complexes with organic matter e g humic substances synthetic chelating ligands sedlak et al 1997 dissolved or sorbed to other particles e g particulate organic matter iron iii hydr oxides shafer et al 1998 worms et al 2010 metal concentrations can be as high as 18 μm for fe 1005 μg l 1 which is often used as a flocculation agent for the removal of phosphorous in wwtps but also other elements such as zn 0 9 μm 59 μg l 1 cu 0 8 μm 52 μg l 1 and ni 0 8 μm 48 μg l 1 can be present at elevated concentrations in wwtp effluents cantinho et al 2016 vriens et al 2017 due to elevated sulfide concentrations in the untreated wastewater a significant fraction of the chalcophile metals e g cu zn cd will be present as metal sulfides for example 30 of the total cu and zn found in rivers close to wwtp discharge points were present as metal sulfides rozan et al 1999 sukola et al 2005 and up to 60 of the cu found in wwtp effluents occurred as particulate material karvelas et al 2003 sulfides and thiols are known to be readily oxidized by ozone von sonntag and von gunten 2012 it was shown that also ag2s in wwtp effluent gets oxidized during ozonation with the concomitant release of ag i the change in ag speciation significantly increased the toxicity toward the green algae chlamydomonas reinhardtii thalmann et al 2015 however for typical ag concentrations reported from wwtp effluents the algal toxicity is negligible nevertheless it is likely that also other metal sulfides in wwtp effluent will be oxidized and the impact on the quality of the effluent water has to be evaluated between 50 and 95 of the non particulate cu in wwtp effluents is complexed by ligands with conditional stability constants comparable to synthetic chelating agents such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta sedlak et al 1997 etda concentrations measured in municipal wwtp effluents are 1 5 μm with the largest fraction being either ni ii cu ii or fe iii edta kari and giger 1996 nirel et al 1998 nowack et al 1996 ozone reacts with tertiary amines such as edta in a one to one ratio by oxidizing the nitrogen to a n oxide von sonntag and von gunten 2012 the reaction is ph dependent as protonation of the amine group lowers the electron density on the nitrogen leading to a decreasing apparent second order rate constant with decreasing ph values bailey et al 1968 henbest and stratford 1964 munoz and von sonntag 2000 thus the free edta is quickly oxidized by ozone k edta 3 2 106 m 1s 1 but the reaction of the mono protonated edta is slower k edta h 1 5 105 m 1s 1 complexation of fe iii however leads to a reduction in the apparent second order rate constant by four orders of magnitude because of the electron withdrawing effect of fe iii k fe iii edta ph 6 3 3 102 m 1s 1 munoz and von sonntag 2000 however the influence of the ph and type of metal chelated on the oxidation of ligands is only poorly understood we determined the stoichiometry of the reaction of ozone with cu cd and zn sulfides and calculated the second order rate constants for the reactions of ozone with the metal sulfides edta and nta metal complexes the sulfides of cu ii zn ii and cd ii were selected due to their high abundance in wwtp effluents and or their ecotoxicological effects afu 2009 cantinho et al 2016 swiss federal council 2017 vriens et al 2017 the edta complexes of cu ii cd ii ni ii zn ii mg ii and pb ii were investigated at various ph values together with the cu ii nta complex furthermore the ozone induced change in speciation of cus cds cu ii edta and cd ii edta spiked to a wwtp effluent during ozonation and a subsequent simulated biological post treatment were studied the toxicity of cus or cds spiked to wwtp effluent before and after ozonation and after biological post treatment was assessed based on dose response experiments using the green algae chlamydomonas reinhardtii 2 materials

millipore 18 2 mω cm cu no3 2 zncl2 cdcl2 merck and a bisulfide solution 2 mm in borate buffer 10 mm at ph 10 nash alfa aesar were mixed 1 1 through a y tube at a flow rate of 10 ml min 1 each

for the synthesis the synthesized metal sulfides were characterized using x ray diffraction xrd and transmission electron microscopy tem solutions of ethylenediaminetetracetic acid edta titrisol 400

prepared by passing ozone containing oxygen gas produced with a cmg 3 3 ozone generator innovatec through ddi water cooled in an ice bath the ozone concentration in the stock solution was determined spectrophotometrically in a 1 cm cell with ε 3200 l mol 1 cm 1 at 260 nm cary 100 varian lee et al 2013 the effluent water was obtained from a pilot wwtp operated at eawag kaegi et al 2011 the

rate constants 2 3 1 apparent second order rate constants of the ozone metal sulfide reactions the rate determining step of the reaction of ozone with metal sulfides was assumed to be second order thalmann et al 2015 as the ozone consumption was too fast for direct monitoring the apparent second order rate constant of this reaction was determined with competition kinetics as described in thalmann et al 2015 in brief a competitor has to be selected for which the second order rate constant with ozone is known very accurately and is comparable same order of magnitude to the unknown second order rate constant of interest in this study buten 3 ol kbu 7 9 104 m 1s 1 dowideit and von sonntag 1998 was selected as the competitor based on previous results from determining the rate

table s2 and formaldehyde ch2o produced by the oxidation of buten 3 ol with ozone was measured see below the apparent second order rate constant for the metal sulfide oxidation k ms can be derived from eq 2 2 c h 2 o 0 c h 2 o 1 k m s k b u m s b u where ch2o 0 is the maximum concentration of formaldehyde that can be formed during the reaction k bu is the known second order rate constant for the reaction of buten 3 ol with ozone and ms bu corresponds to the metal sulfide to buten 3 ol ratio the experiments were conducted in 50 ml ddi water at ph 8 0 10 mm borate buffer and tert butanol 5

fast reactions mg ii ni ii and zn ii edta were measured analogous to the metal sulfides using competition kinetics von sonntag and von gunten 2012 for slower reactions the decrease of ozone over time was recorded with an uv vis spectrometer cary 100 varian using the maximum absorbance of ozone at 260 nm ε 3200 m 1 cm 1 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 measurements were compensated for the ozone decay in a blank sample a buffered edta metal solution 100 or 500 μm was mixed with a specific ozone dose 10 fold lower ozone concentration in a 10 cm quartz cuvette and placed in the spectrophotometer pseudo first order kinetics apparent second order rate constants were calculated by dividing the fitted k obs values by the initial edta concentration in addition apparent second order rate constants of the reaction of the cu ii nta complex with ozone were determined accordingly at phs 7 0 7 25 7 5 7 75 and 8 0 10 mm borate buffer 2 4 speciation bioavailability of cu and cd 2 4 1 speciation bioavailability of cu and cd after ozone treatment and biological post treatment of cus and cds spiked wwtp effluent the speciation of cu and cd after ozone treatment and biological post treatment was assessed by spiking increasing amounts of cus final concentrations 0 0 1 0 2 0 6 1 3 8 20 μm or cds 0 0 1 0 7 4 9 13 30 40 μm to bottles pe filled with 500 ml filtered wwtp effluent each bottle was then treated with a specific ozone dose of 0 52 go3 gdoc for cus or 0 77 go3 gdoc for cds experiments these specific ozone doses were chosen to assure that a full oxidation of the metal sulfides was possible see supporting information si text s1 for calculations the experimental bottles were wrapped in aluminum foil to prevent photo induced reactions and the experiments were conducted in duplicate additional ozone consumption experiments were conducted to evaluate whether the surface of the pe bottles consumed ozone fig s1 total cu or cd concentrations ctotal were determined in bulk samples acidified with hno3 in addition the cu and cd concentrations in treated wwtp effluent were determined after the following procedures i ultrafiltration uf 10 kda 10 000 rpm

metals sorb the devices were deployed for 6 h in the bottles on a shaker table 100 rpm and the temperature was recorded at the start and end of the experiment after 6 h the metals in the chelex resin were desorbed in 1 ml of 1 m hno3 for 24 h the metal concentration was measured in the extracted solutions which allowed calculating the bioavailable metal concentration in the original suspension text s2 based on these concentrations the speciation of cu and cd after ozonation and biological post treatment was assessed by operationally defining three fractions i the dgt bioavailable fraction determined by dgt cdgt meylan et al 2004 tusseau vuillemin et al 2004 ii the none dgt dissolved fraction which is neither particulate nor measured by dgt derived by cuf minus cdgt and iii particulate

al 2009 margot et al 2013 zimmermann et al 2011 allowing for an additional biological post treatment to further degrade only partially oxidized organic material we simulated this biological post treatment in the laboratory according to schindler wildhaber et al 2015 in brief microorganisms were added by spiking 0 5 ml untreated and unfiltered wwtp effluent to the previously ozone treated water bottles 500 ml after incubation on a shaker table for 7 days 100 rpm the three different metal fractions and the total metal contents were determined as described above 2 4 2 speciation bioavailability of cu and cd after ozone treatment of cu ii cd ii edta spiked wwtp effluent to study the oxidation of metal edta complexes in wwtp effluent cu ii and cd ii edta complexes were spiked 4 μm to wwtp effluent 500 ml which were treated with specific ozone doses ranging from 0 to 2 go3 gdoc changes in the speciation of metal complexes were prevented by prior removal of the metals from the wwtp effluent 10 l by adding 5 g of amberlite ir120 sigma aldrich and equilibrating it on a laboratory shaker for 24 h 100 rpm the metal free wwtp effluent was filtered cellulose nitrate 0 45 μm sartorius stedim ch after the addition of the specific ozone doses edta concentrations were measured with high pressure liquid chromatography hplc additionally cu or cd which was either free weakly complexed or bound to small organic molecules excluding edta complexes was determined using dgt as described in 2 4 1 the metals on the chelex were desorbed and measured with icp ms see below 2 5 algal toxicity of cus cds spiked wwtp effluent after ozone and biological post treatment the change in toxicity caused by ozonation and biological post treatment of cus and cds spiked wwtp effluent was assessed by dose response experiments with the green algae chlamydomonas reinhardtii cc 125 chlamydomonas genetics center durham the microalga c reinhardtii was cultured under controlled conditions in the growth medium talaquil model freshwater ph 7 5 scheidegger et al 2011 in a multitron incubator infors ht bottmingen switzerland during the exponential growth phase of the algae the cells were separated from their growth medium by centrifugation 5 min 2500 rpm and the cell number was determined with a cell counter z2 coulter counter beckman coulter the cells were added to 10 ml exposure media to reach a cell count of 2 105 cells ml 1 the exposure media consisted of wwtp effluent after ozone treatment and biological post treatment described in section 2 4 the exposure measurements were done in triplicates additional control experiments as singles were done with exposure media prepared with cu ii or cd ii in mops buffer 10 mm ph 8 0 cu ii or cd ii spiked to ozone treated wwtp effluent cu ii spiked to untreated effluent and cus spiked to effluent the toxic response was determined by measuring the algal photosynthetic yield of the photosystem ii in light after one hour exposure to the media schreiber et al 1995 the photosynthetic yield was measured by fluorometry using a phyto pam heinz walz gmbh equipped with an optical unit ed 101us mp the yield expressed as percentage of the respective control sample was plotted against the total metal concentration and if available also against the bioavailable metal concentration 2 6 inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms from the experiments with cus cds spiked to effluent water the cu and cd concentrations were determined after ozonation and after biological post treatment for all fractions described from the additional toxicity experiments conducted in mops buffer media cu and cd concentrations were determined from the edta experiments in wwtp effluent cu and cd concentrations sampled by the dgt devices were measured all samples were diluted with 1 hno3 to obtain expected cu or cd concentrations of 1 10 μg l 1 measurements were performed with an external calibration using an icp ms agilent 7500cx ql 0 1 μgcu l 1 0 05 μgcd l 1 scandium m z 45 and rhodium m z 103 were used as internal standards to correct for non spectral interferences for cu and cd respectively 2 7 high pressure liquid chromatography the quantification of edta by hplc required the formation of a fe iii edta complex adapted method from laine and matilainen 2005 nowack et al 1996 this was achieved by reacting 0 1 ml of an fecl3 solution 50 μm fe 0 3 m sodium acetate 0 02 m tetrabutylammonium hydroxide at ph 3 15 adjusted with acetic acid with 0 9 ml sample for 24 h at 65 c 100 rpm iron precipitates formed during the reaction were removed by centrifugation 18 000 rpm 31514 g hettich mikro 220r and 0 9 ml was pipetted into a hplc vial if necessary samples were diluted with ddi water to achieve an edta concentration of 0 2 1 μm hplc analysis was performed on thermo scientific uhplc dionex ultimate 3000 with dad and the edta was separated on a reversed phase column waters 3 0 150 mm c18 xbridge 3 5

had a retention time of 2 min and was detected quantified at 254 nm calibrations were performed with an external standard in the concentration range 0 05 1 μm r2 0 9997 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of cus zns cds and wwtp effluent xrd analyses of the freshly synthesized metal sulfides revealed that cus precipitated as covellite zns as sphalerite and the cds as hawleyite sphalerite structure fig s2 the increased peak width observed in the xrd spectra indicated that all metal sulfides were of poor crystallinity tem images of the metal sulfides revealed aggregates 100 nm consisting of smaller particles cus 20 nm cds and zns 5 nm fig s3 the ph of the effluent water was 8 2 before and 8 3 after ozonation and remained constant during the biological post treatment experiments the doc of the effluent water was 7 7 mg l 1 for the cus and 7 6 mg l 1 for the cds experiments and the carbonate alkalinity was 6 mm nitrogen species concentrations are given in table s1 3 2 stoichiometries of the ozone metal sulfide reactions the stoichiometries of the reactions of ozone with cus zns and cds were determined by a linear regression analysis of the transferred ozone doses against the resulting sulfate concentrations fig 1 the sulfate concentrations increased with increasing ozone doses until the spiked metal sulfides 10 μm were completely consumed to reach a complete oxidation of cus an ozone dose of nearly 40 μm was needed for zns and cds it was 30 μm this is reflected in the corresponding stoichiometric factors 3 88 σse 0 13 standard error moles ozone per mol cus 2 62 σse 0 14 for zns and 2 66 σse 0 14 for cds eqs 3 5 derived from the linear regression analysis through the data points for which ozone was not in excess fig 1 open circles show excluded data points ozone oxidizes sulfide ii to sulfate vi by transferring 8 electrons over several reaction intermediates and in theory ozone can accept a maximum of two electrons per molecule resulting in a hypothetical stoichiometric ratio o3 ms of 4 for bisulfide hs the stoichiometric factor for its oxidation to sulfate was previously determined to be 2 4 mark et al 2011 therefore the observed stoichiometric factors lie between the theoretical predictions and the experimental values for dissolved hs the stoichiometric factors for zns and cds are close to the value of 2 9 which was reported for ag2s thalmann et al 2015 it is very likely that the crystal structure significantly influences the reaction stoichiometry as both the stoichiometric factors and the crystal structure both in the sphalerite structure space group f 4 3 m fig s2 of zns and cds are very similar in contrast cus precipitated as covellite where two out of three sulfide atoms form a disulfide s2 2 and consequently the cu is in a mixed valence state which may change the oxidation pathway and the resulting reaction stoichiometry 3 3 kinetics 3 3 1 apparent second order rate constants of the ozone metal sulfide reactions the kinetics of the reactions of metal sulfides with ozone was determined by competition kinetics the measured formaldehyde concentration was plotted as c h 2 o 0 c h 2 o 1 versus the metal sulfide to buten 3 ol ratio according to eq 2 fig 2 the apparent second order rate constants were then derived from the slope of the linear regression line fitted to the data the slope of the applied linear regression is equal to k ms k bu and the resulting apparent second order rate constants at ph 8 are provided in eq 3 to eq 5 table 1 3 c u s 3 9 o 3 k 4 2 10 5 m 1 s 1 s o 4 2 c u i i products 4 z n s 2 6 o 3 k 4 1 10 4 m 1 s 1 s o 4 2 z n i i products 5 c d s 2 7 o 3 k 2 8 10 4 m 1 s 1 s o 4 2 c d i i products the apparent second order rate constants for the reactions of zns and cds with ozone at ph 8 are comparable to ag2s thalmann et al 2015 following the classification scheme based on second order rate constants lee et al 2013 both zns and cds are classified as group ii substances which are oxidized almost completely at specific ozone doses of 0 5 0 7 go3 gdoc typical for full scale wastewater ozonation bourgin et al 2018 cus belongs to group i as its apparent second order rate constant at ph 8 is about one order of magnitude higher than for the other metal sulfides thus cus is expected to be fully oxidized to cuso4 at typical ozone doses applied for micropollutant abatement in full scale treatments the apparent second order rate constants for the reactions of zns and cds with ozone are comparable to the antibiotic clarithromycin lange et al 2006 whereas for cus it is comparable to carbamazepine huber et al 2003 both of these micropollutants are known to be oxidized by ozone to 80 in wwtp effluents for typically applied specific ozone doses intermediate reaction products are generated during the reaction of o3 with metal sulfides which may also consume ozone however even if intermediate reaction products are reacting much faster with o3 compared to the reaction of o3 with the competitor the observed apparent second order constant will be overestimated at the maximum by the stoichiometric factor 3 4 for the investigated metal sulfides furthermore a radical pathway may be part of the oxidation of metal sulfides by ozone producing hydroxyl radicals which would then react with the radical scavenger t buoh to form additional formaldehyde however there is no clear evidence for a formation of hydroxyl radicals by the reaction of bisulfides with o3 mark et al 2011 nevertheless using worst case conditions further detailed in the si text s3 table s2 a maximum increase of the apparent second order rate constants in the order of factor 2 5 cus to 10 zns cds was estimated despite these considerable uncertainties the metal sulfides are still classified as type i or type ii substances and thus are expected to be largely oxidized during advanced wastewater treatment by ozone 3 3 2 apparent second order rate constants for the reactions of edta complexes with ozone the apparent second order rate constants for the reactions of metal edta complexes and metal sulfides with ozone at various ph values are summarized in table 1 and fig s4 the apparent second order rate constants for the reactions of the metal edta complexes increased in the order cd ii pb ii cu ii and edta complexes for ni ii zn ii and mg ii were oxidized significantly faster at ph 8 the apparent second order rate constants for cu ii and cd ii edta complexes were 1 7 102 m 1s 1 and 42 m 1s 1 respectively whereas it was 4 4 103 m 1s 1 for the mg ii edta complex more than one order of magnitude higher the highest apparent second order rate constants at ph 8 were observed for zn ii and ni ii edta with 2 0 104 m 1s 1 and 1 9 104 m 1s 1 respectively pb ii edta had an apparent second order rate constant at ph 6 of 1 2 102 m 1s 1 according to lee et al 2013 substances having rate constants in this range are all classified as group ii substances with almost complete oxidation at specific ozone doses of 0 5 0 7 go3 gdoc typical for enhanced municipal wastewater treatment for micropollutant abatement however comparing the apparent second order rate constants to other micropollutants at ph 8 results in a more differentiated picture cu ii cd ii and pb ii edta have apparent second order rate constants comparable to irbesartan which is oxidized to 50 80 at typical specific ozone doses bourgin et al 2018 and mg edta is comparable to metropolol benner et al 2008 for which an oxidation 80 is expected bourgin et al 2018 the substances having the highest apparent second order rate constants zn ii and ni ii edta are comparable to clarithromycin lange et al 2006 which is also abated to 80 bourgin et al 2018 the apparent second order rate constants for the reactions of the selected metal sulfides with ozone were similar or higher than the corresponding rate constants for metal edta complexes table 1 fig s4 this can be expected from the higher reactivity of s ii compared to amines hoigné et al 1985 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 the influence of ph 6 8 5 on the apparent second order rate constants was very limited for metal edta complexes the apparent second order rate constants ranged within a factor of two except for mg ii for which a factor of 6 was observed speciation calculations spana version 2013 apr 05 revealed that at ph 6 close to 10 of the total edta is not bound to mg ii hence the higher apparent second order rate constant is likely due to the oxidation of uncoordinated hedta having a higher second order rate constant munoz and von sonntag 2000 according to speciation calculations the other metal edta complexes are stable within the investigated ph range ph 6 8 the type of metal cation chelated by edta had a much larger influence on the apparent second order rate constants than the ph for example at ph 6 zn ii ni ii and mg ii edta had similar apparent second order rate constants however for cd ii edta it was 800 times lower table 1 fig s4 3 3 3 second order rate constants for the reaction of cu ii nta with ozone as a comparison to cu ii edta second order rate constants for the reaction of cu ii nta with ozone were determined table 1 the apparent second order rate constants for the reactions of cu ii nta with ozone were in the range of 300 400 m 1 s 1 in the ph range of 7 8 with a slightly increasing trend for higher ph values for ph 7 7 5 the apparent second order rate constants were comparable to cu ii edta however increasing the ph to 8 led to an increase in the apparent second order rate constant of cu ii nta but lower rate constants by about a factor of two were observed for cu ii edta at increasing ph the cu ii nta complex starts coordinating oh groups fig s5 resulting in a weaker metal nitrogen bond which may explain the higher apparent second order rate constants observed at higher ph values 3 4 speciation and bioavailability of cu and cd 3 4 1 speciation and bioavailability of cu and cd after ozone treatment and biological post treatment of cus and cds spiked wwtp effluent the speciation of cu and cd after ozonation and biological post treatment was assessed by individually plotting the dgt bioavailable the none dgt and the particulate fraction for each experiment fig 3 this experimental setup was chosen to investigate different scenarios that may occur in a wastewater treatment plant as in full scale wwtps the ozone concentration is determined by the doc concentrations we also fixed the specific ozone doses according to the doc content and then varied the metal sulfide concentration therefore the results provide information about the changes in the metal speciation and possibly related toxicity caused by a realistic ozone treatment 3 4 1 1 copper without ozone treatment fig 3a first bar metal concentration 0 75 μm the particulate fraction for the cus experiments was around 65 this rather low fraction is probably caused by cu complexes already present in the wwtp effluent by the oxidation of cus during the 6 h dgt experiment and the 10 excess of cu in the cus stock suspension rozan et al 1999 thalmann et al 2014 the ozonation 0 52 go3 gdoc 83 μm of cus spiked effluent waters decreased the particulate fraction to 20 based on the kinetic experiments a complete oxidation of the cus would have been expected for this specific ozone dose therefore the particulate fraction may rather represent precipitates of other cu phases e g tenorite cuo or cu sorbed to particles 0 45 μm than remaining cus particles an exception might be the increased particulate fraction observed at the highest metal concentrations 19 10 μm in these experiments the applied ozone dose becomes the limiting factor consumption of ozone by effluent organic matter and almost 80 μm for full oxidation of cus required which leads to an incomplete oxidation of the cus the dgt fraction of cu was highest 80 at the lowest cu concentration and decreased to 60 for 0 14 μm total cu and further to 40 for the higher total cu concentrations the non dgt fraction was mostly between 40 50 except for the experiment conducted with the lowest cu concentration 0 06 μm where the non dgt fraction was absent see below for discussion after 7 days holding time in the simulated biological post treatment without prior ozone treatment fig 3b first bar the particulate cus fraction decreased to about 45 most likely due to a slow oxidative dissolution of the cus 40 60 expected rozan et al 1999 thalmann et al 2014 with prior ozonation the particulate fraction slightly increased for the lowest and highest cu concentration compared to the experiments without biological post treatment but no significant changes were observed in all other experiments the results of the experiments conducted with total cu concentrations between 0 24 and 7 89 μm revealed that after biological post treatment a rather constant percentage of the dissolved cu was measured by dgt 40 45 pointing towards an equilibrium between the dgt and the non dgt fractions comparable results were observed after the ozonation furthermore additional experiments using wwtp effluent spiked with cu ii fig s6 gave similar results independent of ozone treatment metals in effluent water can form complexes with organic matter and two main types of complexing agents are present in the treated wastewater first there are moieties in the effluent organic matter with mostly phenolic and carboxyl groups forming complexes buffle 1984 second there are chelate forming substances with binding stabilities comparable to synthetic ligands e g edta probably containing additional amine groups sedlak et al 1997 have shown that up to 50 of the cu in wwtp effluent is complexed by substances of the second type which are expected to be not bioavailable tusseau vuillemin et al 2004 this is in agreement with our observations revealing that about 45 of the cu was present as non dgt not bioavailable after ozonation of cus because the ratios of dgt to non dgt fractions remained constant with increasing cu concentrations the speciation of cu was rather determined by the availabilities of the two types of complexing agents and not limited by the cu concentrations 3 4 1 2 cadmium the particulate fraction in effluent water spiked with cds fig 3c and treated with a specific ozone dose of 0 77 go3 gdoc 123 μm decreased from 90 no ozone treatment first bar to a constant value of 60 70 irrespective of the spiked cds concentration the bioavailable fraction increased from 10 no ozone treatment to around 20 for all cds spiked experiments the non dgt fraction was always smaller than the dgt fraction after the biological post treatment the particulate fraction remained at very comparable levels in all experiments and the non dgt fraction slightly decreased for the higher cd concentrations based on the established stoichiometry of the reaction and its kinetics cds is expected to be completely oxidized for the applied conditions and therefore the particulate fraction most likely represents another solid phase speciation calculations using visualminteq v3 1 fig s7 indicated that otavite cdco3 was oversaturated and probably precipitated in the wwtp effluent due to the rather high carbonate alkalinity and ph 6 mm ph 8 2 however the model slightly overestimated the particulate fraction which may be explained by the dom which may have stabilized the cd to a larger extent than predicted by the model calculations in additional experiments with cd ii spiked to wwtp effluent the particulate fraction remained rather low fig s6 this apparent discrepancy may be due to the dom being more efficient in complexation stabilization of cd ii before the ozonation of the wwtp effluent 3 4 1 3 comparison of cu and cd speciation the speciation of cu and cd after ozonation and biological post treatment of cus cds spiked wwtp effluent was very different cu was predominantly present in the non particulate fractions dgt and none dgt and cd was predominantly observed in the particulate fraction in most experiments 50 of the non particulate fraction of cd was assigned to the dgt fraction and therefore classified as bioavailable this suggests that cd in solution formed less of the strong most likely chelated and not bioavailable complexes that were observed for cu sedlak et al 1997 the same trend was observed with wwtp effluent spiked with cd ii cu ii fig s6 however it should be kept in mind that the particulate fractions in the cd experiments were considerably larger compared to the cu experiments and thus the absolute concentrations of bioavailable cu dgt were larger than the respective cd concentrations 3 4 2 ozonation of cu ii cd ii edta spiked to wwtp effluent cu ii and cd ii edta complexes were spiked to a metal free wwtp effluent followed by ozonation with increasing specific ozone doses fig 4 the concentrations of both metal edta complexes decreased with increasing specific ozone doses fig 4 triangles however due of the relatively low apparent second order rate constants for the reactions with ozone at ph 8 table 1 hydroxyl radicals oh present in solution during the ozonation staehelin et al 1984 also contributed to the oxidation of the complex lee and von gunten 2010 munoz and von sonntag 2000 cu and cd concentrations measured by dgt increased with increasing specific ozone doses the metal edta complexes do not pass through the diffusion layer of the dgt thus the increase of the measured metal concentrations by dgt is a consequence of the oxidation of the edta and a release of the free metal ions into the aqueous phase the initial free cu and cd concentrations shown in absence of ozonation are due to an excess of the metal in the metal edta complex stock solutions the increase in bioavailable cu concentrations was smaller than for cd most likely due to the formation of stronger cu complexes with dom which are not measured by dgt this is in agreement with the lower bioavailable fraction of cu in the non particulate fraction 40 compared to the respective cd fraction 50 as observed after the ozonation of cus cds spiked effluents fig 3 the cu ii and cd ii edta complexes were oxidized by 40 50 for typical specific ozone doses 0 5 0 7 go3 gdoc in comparison the metal sulfides were fully oxidized at comparable doses reflecting their orders of magnitude higher second order rate constant 3 5 algal toxicity 3 5 1 algal toxicity of wwtp effluent spiked with cus before and after ozonation and biological post treatment increasing cus concentrations in the effluent water had no effect on the photosynthetic yield of the algae fig 5 blue circles after ozonation only the photosynthetic yield observed in the exposure media with the highest concentration of cu 19 1 μm decreased to 60 n 3 5 yellow solid diamonds at all other concentrations the photosynthetic yield remained close to 100 plotting the photosynthetic yield with respect to cudgt shifted the data to a higher toxicity lower cu concentrations fig 5 brown solid downward triangles after 7 days of biological post treatment a slightly reduced toxicity was observed reflected in the increase of the photosynthetic yield of the algae exposed to the highest cu concentration from 60 to about 80 fig 5 yellow empty diamonds this was likely due to a decrease in the bioavailable cu concentration which is reflected in the decrease of cudgt from 7 4 to 5 4 μm the photosynthetic yield observed in experiments conducted in wwtp effluent spiked with cu ii was not affected by ozonation fig s8 suggesting that the bioavailable fraction before and after ozonation was very comparable however a decreasing photosynthetic yield was observed for algae exposed to cu ii in mops cumops buffer at ph 8 already at cu concentrations of 1 μm fig s8 in the pure media consisting of mops buffer to adjust the ph water and the spiked cu ii dom and other complexing agents are absent hence it is expected that all of the cu is bioavailable and the toxicity would be comparable to the bioavailable concentrations dgt in the treated wwtp effluents however cu ii in mops buffer showed a higher toxicity than measured for the bioavailable cu concentration in the wwtp effluent suggesting that the bioavailable fraction derived from dgt measurements slightly overestimated the effective bioavailable fraction this is supported by studies of tusseau vuillemin et al 2004 revealing that strong small complexing agents e g nitrilotriacetic acid nta form cu ii complexes which can pass the pores of the diffusion layer of the dgt device although such complexes are not bioavailable additionally the availability of high nutrient concentrations present in the wastewater might have masked the negative effects of the bioavailable cu the algal toxicity experiments revealed that the oxidation of cus by ozone increases the toxicity of the wwtp effluent and that a subsequent biological post treatment again mitigates the toxicity overall the following order of wwtp effluent algal toxicity was observed 5 from low to high cus cutot after biological post treatment cutot after ozonation cudgt after biological post treatment cudgt after ozonation cumops 3 5 2 algal toxicity of wwtp effluent spiked with cds after ozonation and biological post treatment c reinhardtii showed a high tolerance for cd spiked to ozonated effluent water fig s9 with the photosynthetic yield remaining above 90 for concentrations 94 μm however ozonated cds spiked wwtp effluent led to a reduction in the photosynthetic yield to about 80 for 40 7 μm cd the subsequent biological post treatment reduced the toxic response and the photosynthetic yield recovered to 90 cd ii in mops buffer cdmops decreased the photosynthetic yield already at 1 μm cd comparable to cu ii the wwtp effluent was reducing the cd toxicity probably through similar processes as for cu the low algal toxicity observed for the cd experiments in effluent water parallels with the low cddgt measured in the respective media and can thus be explained by the limited bioavailability of cd ii furthermore c reinhardtii can effectively reduce toxic effects of heavy metals by producing complexing agents which are very efficient in the case of cd hu et al 2001 overall the following order of wwtp effluent algal toxicity was observed from low to high cd ii spiked to ozonated wastewater cdtot after biological post treatment cdtot after ozonation cddgt after biological post treatment cddgt after ozonation cdmops 3 5 3 toxicity toward more sensitive aquatic organisms the toxicity of metals toward aquatic organisms strongly depends on their speciation allen et al 1980 hockett and mount 1996 the formation of strong metal complexes such as metal edta complexes reduces the bioavailability and the observed toxicity hockett and mount 1996 sorvari and sillanpää 1996 however as we have shown ozonation of wwtp effluent containing metals bound to sulfide or edta can be oxidized leading to an increased bioavailability the green algae c reinhardtii has a rather high tolerance against metals hu et al 2001 however organisms more sensitive to elevated metal concentrations e g daphnia magna might be negatively affected at much lower metal concentrations than reported in this study copper concentrations in wwtp effluent reach values 0 8 μm in switzerland vriens et al 2017 and comparable concentrations have been reported in other countries cantinho et al 2016 karvelas et al 2003 shafer et al 1998 we have shown that after ozonation and biological post treatment of wwtp effluent approximately 40 of the cu will be bioavailable as the ec50 value for daphnia magna is 0 35 μm sorvari and sillanpää 1996 ozonation of wwtp effluent receiving high cu loads may lead to an increased toxicity through the oxidation of cus and or cu complexes followed by the concomitant release of cu into the wwtp effluent cd concentrations currently measured in swiss wwtps are 3 3 nm and thus considerably lower than the ec50 value determined for daphnia magna 220 nm ph 8 200 mgco3 tan and wang 2011 therefore the influence of ozonation on the cd toxicity is expected to be negligible despite an anticipated complete sulfide oxidation of cds during ozonation ozonation of wwtp effluent will also lead to the oxidation of ag2s thalmann et al 2015 and likely also of other metal sulfides e g ni2s3 it may thus be worthwhile to additionally evaluate the metal toxicity in effluents of selected wwtps to exclude that the beneficial abatement of micropollutants by ozonation is counterbalanced by an increased metal toxicity in the treated wastewater 4 conclusions the stoichiometries and kinetics of the reactions of ozone with zns cus and cds were studied the change of cu cd speciation as well as the toxic response of cus and cds spiked effluent water after ozone treatment and biological post treatment was assessed the kinetics of the reactions of metal edta complexes with ozone were determined and the oxidation of cu ii cd ii edta in effluent water was evaluated the following main conclusions can be drawn from our results the stoichiometric factor of the oxidation of the metal sulfide to sulfate by ozone ranged from 2 6 to 3 9 and was therefore between the theoretical predictions 4 moles of ozone per mole metal sulfide and the experimentally determined factor 2 4 for bisulfide the apparent second order rate constants for the reactions of metal sulfides with ozone at ph 8 were in the range of 104 m 1s 1 105 m 1s 1 for the reactions of metal edta complexes with ozone the apparent second order rate constants at ph 8 were lower and ranged from 40 m 1s 1 2 104 m 1s 1 based on the reaction stoichiometry and the apparent second order rate constants sulfides in wwtp effluent are expected to be completely oxidized to sulfate during the full scale ozonation of wastewater effluent for micropollutant abatement this results in a concomitant release of metals from the respective metal sulfides it is expected that 40 of the metal edta complexes will be oxidized during ozonation of wwtp effluent for micropollutant abatement the ozone induced oxidation of the metal sulfides and metal edta complexes led to an increased bioavailability of the metals even though the bioavailable fraction of metals from metal sulfides and from metal edta complexes increased after ozonation the algal toxicity increased only for very high cu and cd concentration above typical concentrations currently observed in wwtp effluents the toxicity of ozone treated wastewater containing elevated concentrations of metals should be evaluated in more detail e g daphnia tests a biological post treatment may improve the water quality of the treated wastewater and is therefore recommended acknowledgment this project was funded by the swiss

19701,ozonation can be applied to mitigate the discharge of organic micropollutants from municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps to the aquatic environment the toxicity of metals also present in wwtp effluents strongly depends on their speciation therefore knowledge on the change of the metal speciation during ozonation of a wwtp effluent is essential to assess possible negative impacts the kinetics and the stoichiometries of the reactions of ozone with three metal sulfides zns cus and cds and metal ethylenediaminetetraacetate edta nitriloriacetic acid nta complexes of cu ii cd ii ni ii zn ii mg ii and pb ii were investigated with a stoichiometric factor of 2 6 3 9 moles of ozone per mole of sulfide and apparent second order rate constants at ph 8 104 m 1 s 1 a complete oxidation of the sulfides and a concomitant release of the respective metals is expected during ozonation of a wwtp effluent for enhanced micropollutant abatement the apparent second order rate constants at ph 8 for the reactions of metal edta complexes with ozone ranged from 42 m 1s 1 to 2 0 104 m 1s 1 and increased in the order cd ii cu ii mg ii ni ii zn ii approximately 40 of cd ii edta spiked to a wwtp effluent was oxidized at typical specific ozone doses of 0 5 0 7 go3 gdoc for the other metal edta complexes a significantly higher fraction was oxidized the bioavailable fraction determined by the diffusive gradient thin films dgt method in the wwtp effluent increased during ozonation due to the oxidative release of the metal ions algal toxicity chlamynomodas reinhardtii tests with cus cds spiked wwtp effluent revealed a high tolerance toward cu and cd in the respective media a toxic response was only observed at cu concentrations above 10 μm which is above typical wwtp effluent concentrations biological post treatment after ozonation generally reduced the bioavailability of the metals which resulted in a lower toxicity therefore the biological post treatment serves as an additional barrier to protect the downstream ecology of receiving waters graphical abstract image 1 keywords wastewater treatment ozonation metal sulfides metal complexes kinetics speciation 1

flocculation agent for the removal of phosphorous in wwtps but also other elements such as zn 0 9 μm 59 μg l 1 cu 0 8 μm 52 μg l 1 and ni 0 8 μm 48 μg l 1 can be present at elevated concentrations in wwtp effluents cantinho et al 2016 vriens et al 2017 due to elevated sulfide concentrations in the untreated wastewater a significant fraction of the chalcophile metals e g cu zn cd will be present as metal sulfides for example 30 of the total cu and zn found in rivers close to wwtp discharge points were present as metal sulfides rozan et al 1999 sukola et al 2005 and up to 60 of the cu found in wwtp effluents occurred as particulate material karvelas et al 2003 sulfides and thiols are known to be readily oxidized by ozone von sonntag and von gunten 2012 it was shown that also ag2s in wwtp effluent gets oxidized during ozonation with the concomitant release of ag i the change in ag speciation significantly increased the toxicity toward the green algae chlamydomonas reinhardtii thalmann et al 2015 however for typical ag concentrations reported from wwtp effluents the algal toxicity is negligible nevertheless it is likely that also other metal sulfides in wwtp effluent will be oxidized and the impact on the quality of the effluent water has to be evaluated between 50 and 95 of the non particulate cu in wwtp effluents is complexed by ligands with conditional stability constants comparable to synthetic chelating agents such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta sedlak et al 1997 etda concentrations measured in municipal wwtp effluents are 1 5 μm with the largest fraction being either ni ii cu ii or fe iii edta kari and giger 1996 nirel et al 1998 nowack et al 1996 ozone reacts with tertiary amines such as edta in a one to one ratio by oxidizing the nitrogen to a n oxide von sonntag and von gunten 2012 the reaction is ph dependent as protonation of the amine group lowers the electron density on the nitrogen leading to a decreasing apparent second order rate constant with decreasing ph values bailey et al 1968 henbest and stratford 1964 munoz and von sonntag 2000 thus the free edta is quickly oxidized by ozone k edta 3 2 106 m 1s 1 but the reaction of the mono protonated edta is slower k edta h 1 5 105 m 1s 1 complexation of fe iii however leads to a reduction in the apparent second order rate constant by four orders of magnitude because of the electron withdrawing effect of fe iii k fe iii edta ph 6 3 3 102 m 1s 1 munoz and von sonntag 2000 however the influence of the ph and type of metal chelated on the oxidation of ligands is only poorly understood we determined the stoichiometry of the reaction of ozone with cu cd and zn sulfides and calculated the second order rate constants for the reactions of ozone with the metal sulfides edta and nta metal complexes the sulfides of cu ii zn ii and cd ii were selected due to their high abundance in wwtp effluents and or their ecotoxicological effects afu 2009 cantinho et al 2016 swiss federal council 2017 vriens et al 2017 the edta complexes of cu ii cd ii ni ii zn ii mg ii and pb ii were investigated at various ph values together with the cu ii nta complex furthermore the ozone induced change in speciation of cus cds cu ii edta and cd ii edta spiked to a wwtp effluent during ozonation and a subsequent simulated biological post treatment were studied the toxicity of cus or

rate constants 2 3 1 apparent second order rate constants of the ozone metal sulfide reactions the rate determining step of the reaction of ozone with metal sulfides was assumed to be second order thalmann et al 2015 as the ozone consumption was too fast for direct monitoring the apparent second order rate constant of this reaction was determined with competition kinetics as described in thalmann et al 2015 in brief a competitor has to be selected for which the second order rate constant with ozone is known very accurately and is comparable same order of magnitude to the unknown second order rate constant of interest in this study buten 3 ol kbu 7 9 104 m 1s 1 dowideit and von sonntag 1998 was selected as the competitor based on previous results from determining the rate

table s2 and formaldehyde ch2o produced by the oxidation of buten 3 ol with ozone was measured see below the apparent second order rate constant for the metal sulfide oxidation k ms can be derived from eq 2 2 c h 2 o 0 c h 2 o 1 k m s k b u m s b u where ch2o 0 is the maximum concentration of formaldehyde that can be formed during the reaction k bu is the known second order rate constant for the reaction of buten 3 ol with ozone and ms bu corresponds to the metal sulfide to buten 3 ol ratio the experiments were conducted in 50 ml ddi water at ph 8 0 10 mm borate buffer and tert butanol 5

fast reactions mg ii ni ii and zn ii edta were measured analogous to the metal sulfides using competition kinetics von sonntag and von gunten 2012 for slower reactions the decrease of ozone over time was recorded with an uv vis spectrometer cary 100 varian using the maximum absorbance of ozone at 260 nm ε 3200 m 1 cm 1 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 measurements were compensated for the ozone decay in a blank sample a buffered edta metal solution 100 or 500 μm was mixed with a specific ozone dose 10 fold lower ozone concentration in a 10 cm quartz cuvette and placed in the spectrophotometer pseudo first order kinetics apparent second order rate constants were calculated by dividing the fitted k obs values by the initial edta concentration in addition apparent second order rate constants of the reaction of the cu ii nta complex with ozone were determined accordingly at phs 7 0 7 25 7 5 7 75 and 8 0 10 mm borate buffer 2 4 speciation bioavailability of cu and cd 2 4 1 speciation bioavailability of cu and cd after ozone treatment and biological post treatment of cus and cds spiked wwtp effluent the speciation of cu and cd after ozone treatment and biological

each bottle was then treated with a specific ozone dose of 0 52 go3 gdoc for cus or 0 77 go3 gdoc for cds experiments these specific ozone doses were chosen to assure that a full oxidation of the metal sulfides was possible see supporting information si text s1 for calculations the experimental bottles were wrapped in aluminum foil to prevent photo induced reactions and the experiments were conducted in duplicate additional ozone consumption experiments were conducted to evaluate whether the surface of the pe bottles consumed ozone fig s1 total cu or cd concentrations ctotal were determined in bulk samples acidified with hno3 in addition the cu and cd concentrations in treated wwtp effluent were determined after the following procedures i ultrafiltration uf 10 kda 10 000 rpm

cd cdgt often referred to as the bioavailable concentration dgt is a passive sampler for metals consisting of a filter membrane as a protection a diffusive gel and a chelex binding resin to which the metals sorb the devices were deployed for 6 h in the bottles on a shaker table 100 rpm and the temperature was recorded at the start and end of the experiment after 6 h the metals in the chelex resin were desorbed in 1 ml of 1 m hno3 for 24 h the metal concentration was measured in the extracted solutions which allowed calculating the bioavailable metal concentration in the original suspension text s2 based on these concentrations the speciation of cu and cd after ozonation and biological post treatment was assessed by operationally defining three fractions i the dgt bioavailable fraction determined by dgt cdgt meylan et al 2004 tusseau vuillemin et al 2004 ii the none dgt dissolved fraction which is neither particulate nor measured by dgt derived by cuf minus cdgt and iii particulate fraction particles larger than 10 kda 1 nm derived by ctotal minus cuf in full scale wwtps the ozone treated water further passes through a rapid sand filtration or another treatment step hollender et al 2009 margot et al 2013 zimmermann et al 2011 allowing for an additional biological post treatment to further degrade only partially oxidized organic material we simulated this biological post treatment in the laboratory according to schindler wildhaber et al 2015 in brief microorganisms were added by spiking 0 5 ml untreated and unfiltered wwtp effluent to the previously ozone treated water bottles 500 ml after incubation on a shaker table for 7 days 100 rpm the three different metal fractions and the total metal contents were determined as described above 2 4 2 speciation bioavailability of cu and cd after ozone treatment of cu ii cd ii edta spiked wwtp effluent to study the oxidation of metal edta complexes in wwtp effluent cu ii and cd ii edta complexes were spiked 4 μm to wwtp effluent 500 ml which were treated with specific ozone doses ranging from 0 to 2 go3 gdoc changes in the speciation of metal complexes were prevented by prior removal of the metals from the wwtp effluent 10 l by adding 5 g of amberlite ir120 sigma aldrich and equilibrating it on a laboratory shaker for 24 h 100 rpm the metal free wwtp effluent was filtered cellulose nitrate 0 45 μm sartorius stedim ch after the addition of the specific ozone doses edta concentrations were measured with high pressure liquid chromatography hplc additionally cu or cd which was either free weakly complexed or bound to small organic molecules excluding edta complexes was determined using dgt as described in 2 4 1 the metals on the chelex were desorbed and measured with icp ms see below 2 5 algal toxicity of cus cds spiked wwtp effluent after ozone and biological post treatment the change in toxicity caused by ozonation and biological post treatment of cus and cds spiked wwtp effluent was assessed by dose response experiments with the green algae chlamydomonas reinhardtii cc 125 chlamydomonas genetics center durham the microalga c reinhardtii was cultured under controlled conditions in the growth medium talaquil model freshwater ph 7 5 scheidegger et al 2011 in a multitron incubator infors ht bottmingen switzerland during the exponential growth phase of the algae the cells were separated from their growth medium by centrifugation 5 min 2500 rpm and the cell number was determined with a cell counter z2 coulter counter beckman coulter the cells were added to 10 ml exposure media to reach a cell count of 2 105 cells ml 1 the exposure media consisted of wwtp effluent after ozone treatment and biological post treatment described in section 2 4 the exposure measurements were done in triplicates additional control experiments as singles were done with exposure media prepared with cu ii or cd ii in mops buffer 10 mm ph 8 0 cu ii or cd ii spiked to ozone treated wwtp effluent cu ii spiked to untreated effluent and cus spiked to effluent the toxic response was determined by measuring the algal photosynthetic yield of the photosystem ii in light after one hour exposure to the media schreiber et al 1995 the photosynthetic yield was measured by fluorometry using a phyto pam heinz walz gmbh equipped with an optical unit ed 101us mp the yield expressed as percentage of the respective control sample was plotted against the total metal concentration and if available also against the bioavailable metal concentration 2 6 inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms from the experiments with cus cds spiked to effluent water the cu and cd concentrations were determined after ozonation and after biological post treatment for all fractions described from the additional toxicity experiments conducted in mops buffer media cu and cd concentrations were determined from the edta experiments in wwtp effluent cu and cd concentrations sampled by the dgt devices were measured all samples were diluted with 1 hno3 to obtain expected cu or cd concentrations of 1 10 μg l 1 measurements were performed with an external calibration using an icp ms agilent 7500cx ql 0 1 μgcu l 1 0 05 μgcd l 1 scandium m z 45 and rhodium m z 103 were used as internal standards to correct for non spectral interferences for cu and cd respectively 2 7 high pressure liquid chromatography the quantification of edta by hplc required the formation of a fe iii edta complex adapted method from laine and matilainen 2005 nowack et al 1996 this was achieved by reacting 0 1 ml of an fecl3 solution 50 μm fe 0 3 m sodium acetate 0 02 m tetrabutylammonium hydroxide at ph 3 15 adjusted with acetic acid with 0 9 ml sample for 24 h at 65 c 100 rpm iron precipitates formed during the reaction were removed by centrifugation 18 000 rpm 31514 g hettich mikro 220r and 0 9 ml was pipetted into a hplc vial if necessary samples were diluted with ddi water to achieve an edta concentration of 0 2 1 μm hplc analysis was performed on thermo scientific uhplc dionex ultimate 3000 with dad and the edta was separated on a reversed phase column waters 3 0 150 mm c18 xbridge 3 5

had a retention time of 2 min and was detected quantified at 254 nm calibrations were performed with an external standard in the concentration range 0 05 1 μm r2 0 9997 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of cus zns cds and wwtp effluent xrd analyses of the freshly synthesized metal sulfides revealed that cus precipitated as covellite zns as sphalerite and the cds as hawleyite sphalerite structure fig s2 the increased peak width observed in the xrd spectra indicated that all metal sulfides were of poor crystallinity tem images of the metal sulfides revealed aggregates 100 nm consisting of smaller particles cus 20 nm cds and zns 5 nm fig s3 the ph of the effluent water was 8 2 before and 8 3 after ozonation and remained constant during the biological post treatment experiments the doc of the effluent water was 7 7 mg l 1 for the cus and 7 6 mg l 1 for the cds experiments and the carbonate alkalinity was 6 mm nitrogen species concentrations are given in table s1 3 2 stoichiometries of the ozone metal sulfide reactions the stoichiometries of the reactions of ozone with cus zns and cds were determined by a linear regression analysis of the transferred ozone doses against the resulting sulfate concentrations fig 1 the sulfate concentrations increased with increasing ozone doses until the spiked metal sulfides 10 μm were completely consumed to reach a complete oxidation of cus an ozone dose of nearly 40 μm was needed for zns and cds it was 30 μm this is reflected in the corresponding stoichiometric factors 3 88 σse 0 13 standard error moles ozone per mol cus 2 62 σse 0 14 for zns and 2 66 σse 0 14 for cds eqs 3 5 derived from the linear regression analysis through the data points for which ozone was not in excess fig 1 open circles show excluded data points ozone oxidizes sulfide ii to sulfate vi by transferring 8 electrons over several reaction intermediates and in theory ozone can accept a maximum of two electrons per molecule resulting in a hypothetical stoichiometric ratio o3 ms of 4 for bisulfide hs the stoichiometric factor for its oxidation to sulfate was previously determined to be 2 4 mark et al 2011 therefore the observed stoichiometric factors lie between the theoretical predictions and the experimental values for dissolved hs the stoichiometric factors for zns and cds are close to the value of 2 9 which was reported for ag2s thalmann et al 2015 it is very likely that the crystal structure significantly influences the reaction stoichiometry as both the stoichiometric factors and the crystal structure both in the sphalerite structure space group f 4 3 m fig s2 of zns and cds are very similar in contrast cus precipitated as covellite where two out of three sulfide atoms form a disulfide s2 2 and consequently the cu is in a mixed valence state which may change the oxidation pathway and the resulting reaction stoichiometry 3 3 kinetics 3 3 1 apparent second order rate constants of the ozone metal sulfide reactions the kinetics of the reactions of metal sulfides with ozone was determined by competition kinetics the measured formaldehyde concentration was plotted as c h 2 o 0 c h 2 o 1 versus the metal sulfide to buten 3 ol ratio according to eq 2 fig 2 the apparent second order rate constants were then derived from the slope of the linear regression line fitted to the data the slope of the applied linear regression is equal to k ms k bu and the resulting apparent second order rate constants at ph 8 are provided in eq 3 to eq 5 table 1 3 c u s 3 9 o 3 k 4 2 10 5 m 1 s 1 s o 4 2 c u i i products 4 z n s 2 6 o 3 k 4 1 10 4 m 1 s 1 s o 4 2 z n i i products 5 c d s 2 7 o 3 k 2 8 10 4 m 1 s 1 s o 4 2 c d i i products the apparent second order rate constants for the reactions of zns and cds with ozone at ph 8 are comparable to ag2s thalmann et al 2015 following the classification scheme based on second order rate constants lee et al 2013 both zns and cds are classified as group ii substances which are oxidized almost completely at specific ozone doses of 0 5 0 7 go3 gdoc typical for full scale wastewater ozonation bourgin et al 2018 cus belongs to group i as its apparent second order rate constant at ph 8 is about one order of magnitude higher than for the other metal sulfides thus cus is expected to be fully oxidized to cuso4 at typical ozone doses applied for micropollutant abatement in full scale treatments the apparent second order rate constants for the reactions of zns and cds with ozone are comparable to the antibiotic clarithromycin lange et al 2006 whereas for cus it is comparable to carbamazepine huber et al 2003 both of these micropollutants are known to be oxidized by ozone to 80 in wwtp effluents for typically applied specific ozone doses intermediate reaction products are generated during the reaction of o3 with metal sulfides which may also consume ozone however even if intermediate reaction products are reacting much faster with o3 compared to the reaction of o3 with the competitor the observed apparent second order constant will be overestimated at the maximum by the stoichiometric factor 3 4 for the investigated metal sulfides furthermore a radical pathway may be part of the oxidation of metal sulfides by ozone producing hydroxyl radicals which would then react with the radical scavenger t buoh to form additional formaldehyde however there is no clear evidence for a formation of hydroxyl radicals by the reaction of bisulfides with o3 mark et al 2011 nevertheless using worst case conditions further detailed in the si text s3 table s2 a maximum increase of the apparent second order rate constants in the order of factor 2 5 cus to 10 zns cds was estimated despite these considerable uncertainties the metal sulfides are still classified as type i or type ii substances and thus are expected to be largely oxidized during advanced wastewater treatment by ozone 3 3 2 apparent second order rate constants for the reactions of edta complexes with ozone the apparent second order rate constants for the reactions of metal edta complexes and metal sulfides with ozone at various ph values are summarized in table 1 and fig s4 the apparent second order rate constants for the reactions of the metal edta complexes increased in the order cd ii pb ii cu ii and edta complexes for ni ii zn ii and mg ii were oxidized significantly faster at ph 8 the apparent second order rate constants for cu ii and cd ii edta complexes were 1 7 102 m 1s 1 and 42 m 1s 1 respectively whereas it was 4 4 103 m 1s 1 for the mg ii edta complex more than one order of magnitude higher the highest apparent second order rate constants at ph 8 were observed for zn ii and ni ii edta with 2 0 104 m 1s 1 and 1 9 104 m 1s 1 respectively pb ii edta had an apparent second order rate constant at ph 6 of 1 2 102 m 1s 1 according to lee et al 2013 substances having rate constants in this range are all classified as group ii substances with almost complete oxidation at specific ozone doses of 0 5 0 7 go3 gdoc typical for enhanced municipal wastewater treatment for micropollutant abatement however comparing the apparent second order rate constants to other micropollutants at ph 8 results in a more differentiated picture cu ii cd ii and pb ii edta have apparent second order rate constants comparable to irbesartan which is oxidized to 50 80 at typical specific ozone doses bourgin et al 2018 and mg edta is comparable to metropolol benner et al 2008 for which an oxidation 80 is expected bourgin et al 2018 the substances having the highest apparent second order rate constants zn ii and ni ii edta are comparable to clarithromycin lange et al 2006 which is also abated to 80 bourgin et al 2018 the apparent second order rate constants for the reactions of the selected metal sulfides with ozone were similar or higher than the corresponding rate constants for metal edta complexes table 1 fig s4 this can be expected from the higher reactivity of s ii compared to amines hoigné et al 1985 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 the influence of ph 6 8 5 on the apparent second order rate constants was very limited for metal edta complexes the apparent second order rate constants ranged within a factor of two except for mg ii for which a factor of 6 was observed speciation calculations spana version 2013 apr 05 revealed that at ph 6 close to 10 of the total edta is not bound to mg ii hence the higher apparent second order rate constant is likely due to the oxidation of uncoordinated hedta having a higher second order rate constant munoz and von sonntag 2000 according to speciation calculations the other metal edta complexes are stable within the investigated ph range ph 6 8 the type of metal cation chelated by edta had a much larger influence on the apparent second order rate constants than the ph for example at ph 6 zn ii ni ii and mg ii edta had similar apparent second order rate constants however for cd ii edta it was 800 times lower table 1 fig s4 3 3 3 second order rate constants for the reaction of cu ii nta with ozone as a comparison to cu ii edta second order rate constants for the reaction of cu ii nta with ozone were determined table 1 the apparent second order rate constants for the reactions of cu ii nta with ozone were in the range of 300 400 m 1 s 1 in the ph range of 7 8 with a slightly increasing trend for higher ph values for ph 7 7 5 the apparent second order rate constants were comparable to cu ii edta however increasing the ph to 8 led to an increase in the apparent second order rate constant of cu ii nta but lower rate constants by about a factor of two were observed for cu ii edta at increasing ph the cu ii nta complex starts coordinating oh groups fig s5 resulting in a weaker metal nitrogen bond which may explain the higher apparent second order rate constants observed at higher ph values 3 4 speciation and bioavailability of cu and cd 3 4 1 speciation and bioavailability of cu and cd after ozone treatment and biological post treatment of cus and cds spiked wwtp effluent the speciation of cu and cd after ozonation and biological post treatment was assessed by individually plotting the dgt bioavailable the none dgt and the particulate fraction for each experiment fig 3 this experimental setup was chosen to investigate different scenarios that may occur in a wastewater treatment plant as in full scale wwtps the ozone concentration is determined by the doc concentrations we also fixed the specific ozone doses according to the doc content and then varied the metal sulfide concentration therefore the results provide information about the changes in the metal speciation and possibly related toxicity caused by a realistic ozone treatment 3 4 1 1 copper without ozone treatment fig 3a first bar metal concentration 0 75 μm the particulate fraction for the cus experiments was around 65 this rather low fraction is probably caused by cu complexes already present in the wwtp effluent by the oxidation of cus during the 6 h dgt experiment and the 10 excess of cu in the cus stock suspension rozan et al 1999 thalmann et al 2014 the ozonation 0 52 go3 gdoc 83 μm of cus spiked effluent waters decreased the particulate fraction to 20 based on the kinetic experiments a complete oxidation of the cus would have been expected for this specific ozone dose therefore the particulate fraction may rather represent precipitates of other cu phases e g tenorite cuo or cu sorbed to particles 0 45 μm than remaining cus particles an exception might be the increased particulate fraction observed at the highest metal concentrations 19 10 μm in these experiments the applied ozone dose becomes the limiting factor consumption of ozone by effluent organic matter and almost 80 μm for full oxidation of cus required which leads to an incomplete oxidation of the cus the dgt fraction of cu was highest 80 at the lowest cu concentration and decreased to 60 for 0 14 μm total cu and further to 40 for the higher total cu concentrations the non dgt fraction was mostly between 40 50 except for the experiment conducted with the lowest cu concentration 0 06 μm where the non dgt fraction was absent see below for discussion after 7 days holding time in the simulated biological post treatment without prior ozone treatment fig 3b first bar the particulate cus fraction decreased to about 45 most likely due to a slow oxidative dissolution of the cus 40 60 expected rozan et al 1999 thalmann et al 2014 with prior ozonation the particulate fraction slightly increased for the lowest and highest cu concentration compared to the experiments without biological post treatment but no significant changes were observed in all other experiments the results of the experiments conducted with total cu concentrations between 0 24 and 7 89 μm revealed that after biological post treatment a rather constant percentage of the dissolved cu was measured by dgt 40 45 pointing towards an equilibrium between the dgt and the non dgt fractions comparable results were observed after the ozonation furthermore additional experiments using wwtp effluent spiked with cu ii fig s6 gave similar results independent of ozone treatment metals in effluent water can form complexes with organic matter and two main types of complexing agents are present in the treated wastewater first there are moieties in the effluent organic matter with mostly phenolic and carboxyl groups forming complexes buffle 1984 second there are chelate forming substances with binding stabilities comparable to synthetic ligands e g edta probably containing additional amine groups sedlak et al 1997 have shown that up to 50 of the cu in wwtp effluent is complexed by substances of the second type which are expected to be not bioavailable tusseau vuillemin et al 2004 this is in agreement with our observations revealing that about 45 of the cu was present as non dgt not bioavailable after ozonation of cus because the ratios of dgt to non dgt fractions remained constant with increasing cu concentrations the speciation of cu was rather determined by the availabilities of the two types of complexing agents and not limited by the cu concentrations 3 4 1 2 cadmium the particulate fraction in effluent water spiked with cds fig 3c and treated with a specific ozone dose of 0 77 go3 gdoc 123 μm decreased from 90 no ozone treatment first bar to a constant value of 60 70 irrespective of the spiked cds concentration the bioavailable fraction increased from 10 no ozone treatment to around 20 for all cds spiked experiments the non dgt fraction was always smaller than the dgt fraction after the biological post treatment the particulate fraction remained at very comparable levels in all experiments and the non dgt fraction slightly decreased for the higher cd concentrations based on the established stoichiometry of the reaction and its kinetics cds is expected to be completely oxidized for the applied conditions and therefore the particulate fraction most likely represents another solid phase speciation calculations using visualminteq v3 1 fig s7 indicated that otavite cdco3 was oversaturated and probably precipitated in the wwtp effluent due to the rather high carbonate alkalinity and ph 6 mm ph 8 2 however the model slightly overestimated the particulate fraction which may be explained by the dom which may have stabilized the cd to a larger extent than predicted by the model calculations in additional experiments with cd ii spiked to wwtp effluent the particulate fraction remained rather low fig s6 this apparent discrepancy may be due to the dom being more efficient in complexation stabilization of cd ii before the ozonation of the wwtp effluent 3 4 1 3 comparison of cu and cd speciation the speciation of cu and cd after ozonation and biological post treatment of cus cds spiked wwtp effluent was very different cu was predominantly present in the non particulate fractions dgt and none dgt and cd was predominantly observed in the particulate fraction in most experiments 50 of the non particulate fraction of cd was assigned to the dgt fraction and therefore classified as bioavailable this suggests that cd in solution formed less of the strong most likely chelated and not bioavailable complexes that were observed for cu sedlak et al 1997 the same trend was observed with wwtp effluent spiked with cd ii cu ii fig s6 however it should be kept in mind that the particulate fractions in the cd experiments were considerably larger compared to the cu experiments and thus the absolute concentrations of bioavailable cu dgt were larger than the respective cd concentrations 3 4 2 ozonation of cu ii cd ii edta spiked to wwtp effluent cu ii and cd ii edta complexes were spiked to a metal free wwtp effluent followed by ozonation with increasing specific ozone doses fig 4 the concentrations of both metal edta complexes decreased with increasing specific ozone doses fig 4 triangles however due of the relatively low apparent second order rate constants for the reactions with ozone at ph 8 table 1 hydroxyl radicals oh present in solution during the ozonation staehelin et al 1984 also contributed to the oxidation of the complex lee and von gunten 2010 munoz and von sonntag 2000 cu and cd concentrations measured by dgt increased with increasing specific ozone doses the metal edta complexes do not pass through the diffusion layer of the dgt thus the increase of the measured metal concentrations by dgt is a consequence of the oxidation of the edta and a release of the free metal ions into the aqueous phase the initial free cu and cd concentrations shown in absence of ozonation are due to an excess of the metal in the metal edta complex stock solutions the increase in bioavailable cu concentrations was smaller than for cd most likely due to the formation of stronger cu complexes with dom which are not measured by dgt this is in agreement with the lower bioavailable fraction of cu in the non particulate fraction 40 compared to the respective cd fraction 50 as observed after the ozonation of cus cds spiked effluents fig 3 the cu ii and cd ii edta complexes were oxidized by 40 50 for typical specific ozone doses 0 5 0 7 go3 gdoc in comparison the metal sulfides were fully oxidized at comparable doses reflecting their orders of magnitude higher second order rate constant 3 5 algal toxicity 3 5 1 algal toxicity of wwtp effluent spiked with cus before and after ozonation and biological post treatment increasing cus concentrations in the effluent water had no effect on the photosynthetic yield of the algae fig 5 blue circles after ozonation only the photosynthetic yield observed in the exposure media with the highest concentration of cu 19 1 μm decreased to 60 n 3 5 yellow solid diamonds at all other concentrations the photosynthetic yield remained close to 100 plotting the photosynthetic yield with respect to cudgt shifted the data to a higher toxicity lower cu concentrations fig 5 brown solid downward triangles after 7 days of biological post treatment a slightly reduced toxicity was observed reflected in the increase of the photosynthetic yield of the algae exposed to the highest cu concentration from 60 to about 80 fig 5 yellow empty diamonds this was likely due to a decrease in the bioavailable cu concentration which is reflected in the decrease of cudgt from 7 4 to 5 4 μm the photosynthetic yield observed in experiments conducted in wwtp effluent spiked with cu ii was not affected by ozonation fig s8 suggesting that the bioavailable fraction before and after ozonation was very comparable however a decreasing photosynthetic yield was observed for algae exposed to cu ii in mops cumops buffer at ph 8 already at cu concentrations of 1 μm fig s8 in the pure media consisting of mops buffer to adjust the ph water and the spiked cu ii dom and other complexing agents are absent hence it is expected that all of the cu is bioavailable and the toxicity would be comparable to the bioavailable concentrations dgt in the treated wwtp effluents however cu ii in mops buffer showed a higher toxicity than measured for the bioavailable cu concentration in the wwtp effluent suggesting that the bioavailable fraction derived from dgt measurements slightly overestimated the effective bioavailable fraction this is supported by studies of tusseau vuillemin et al 2004 revealing that strong small complexing agents e g nitrilotriacetic acid nta form cu ii complexes which can pass the pores of the diffusion layer of the dgt device although such complexes are not bioavailable additionally the availability of high nutrient concentrations present in the wastewater might have masked the negative effects of the bioavailable cu the algal toxicity experiments revealed that the oxidation of cus by ozone increases the toxicity of the wwtp effluent and that a subsequent biological post treatment again mitigates the toxicity overall the following order of wwtp effluent algal toxicity was observed 5 from low to high cus cutot after biological post treatment cutot after ozonation cudgt after biological post treatment cudgt after ozonation cumops 3 5 2 algal toxicity of wwtp effluent spiked with cds after ozonation and biological post treatment c reinhardtii showed a high tolerance for cd spiked to ozonated effluent water fig s9 with the photosynthetic yield remaining above 90 for concentrations 94 μm however ozonated cds spiked wwtp effluent led to a reduction in the photosynthetic yield to about 80 for 40 7 μm cd the subsequent biological post treatment reduced the toxic response and the photosynthetic yield recovered to 90 cd ii in mops buffer cdmops decreased the photosynthetic yield already at 1 μm cd comparable to cu ii the wwtp effluent was reducing the cd toxicity probably through similar processes as for cu the low algal toxicity observed for the cd experiments in effluent water parallels with the low cddgt measured in the respective media and can thus be explained by the limited bioavailability of cd ii furthermore c reinhardtii can effectively reduce toxic effects of heavy metals by producing complexing agents which are very efficient in the case of cd hu et al 2001 overall the following order of wwtp effluent algal toxicity was observed from low to high cd ii spiked to ozonated wastewater cdtot after biological post treatment cdtot after ozonation cddgt after biological post treatment cddgt after ozonation cdmops 3 5 3 toxicity toward more sensitive aquatic organisms the toxicity of metals toward aquatic organisms strongly depends on their speciation allen et al 1980 hockett and mount 1996 the formation of strong metal complexes such as metal edta complexes reduces the bioavailability and the observed toxicity hockett and mount 1996 sorvari and sillanpää 1996 however as we have shown ozonation of wwtp effluent containing metals bound to sulfide or edta can be oxidized leading to an increased bioavailability the green algae c reinhardtii has a rather high tolerance against metals hu et al 2001 however organisms more sensitive to elevated metal concentrations e g daphnia magna might be negatively affected at much lower metal concentrations than reported in this study copper concentrations in wwtp effluent reach values 0 8 μm in switzerland vriens et al 2017 and comparable concentrations have been reported in other countries cantinho et al 2016 karvelas et al 2003 shafer et al 1998 we have shown that after ozonation and biological post treatment of wwtp effluent approximately 40 of the cu will be bioavailable as the ec50 value for daphnia magna is 0 35 μm sorvari and sillanpää 1996 ozonation of wwtp effluent receiving high cu loads may lead to an increased toxicity through the oxidation of cus and or cu complexes followed by the concomitant release of cu into the wwtp effluent cd concentrations currently measured in swiss wwtps are 3 3 nm and thus considerably lower than the ec50 value determined for daphnia magna 220 nm ph 8 200 mgco3 tan and wang 2011 therefore the influence of ozonation on the cd toxicity is expected to be negligible despite an anticipated complete sulfide oxidation of cds during ozonation ozonation of wwtp effluent will also lead to the oxidation of ag2s thalmann et al 2015 and likely also of other metal sulfides e g ni2s3 it may thus be worthwhile to additionally evaluate the metal toxicity in effluents of selected wwtps to exclude that the beneficial abatement of micropollutants by ozonation is counterbalanced by an increased metal toxicity in the treated wastewater 4 conclusions the stoichiometries and kinetics of the reactions of ozone with zns cus and cds were studied the change of cu cd speciation as well as the toxic response of cus and cds spiked effluent water after ozone treatment and biological post treatment was assessed the kinetics of the reactions of metal edta complexes with ozone were determined and the oxidation of cu ii cd ii edta in effluent water was evaluated the following main conclusions can be drawn from our results the stoichiometric factor of the oxidation of the metal sulfide to sulfate by ozone ranged from 2 6 to 3 9 and was therefore between the theoretical predictions 4 moles of ozone per mole metal sulfide and the experimentally determined factor 2 4 for bisulfide the apparent second order rate constants for the reactions of metal sulfides with ozone at ph 8 were in the range of 104 m 1s 1 105 m 1s 1 for the reactions of metal edta complexes with ozone the apparent second order rate constants at ph 8 were lower and ranged from 40 m 1s 1 2 104 m 1s 1 based on the reaction stoichiometry and the apparent second order rate constants sulfides in wwtp effluent are expected to be completely oxidized to sulfate during the full scale ozonation of wastewater effluent for micropollutant abatement this results in a concomitant release of metals from the respective metal sulfides it is expected that 40 of the metal edta complexes will be oxidized during ozonation of wwtp effluent for micropollutant abatement the ozone induced oxidation of the metal sulfides and metal edta complexes led to an increased bioavailability of the metals even though the bioavailable fraction of metals from metal sulfides and from metal edta complexes increased after ozonation the algal toxicity increased only for very high cu and cd concentration above typical concentrations currently observed in wwtp effluents the toxicity of ozone treated wastewater containing elevated concentrations of metals should be evaluated in more detail e g daphnia tests a biological post treatment may improve the water quality of the treated wastewater and is therefore recommended acknowledgment this project was funded by the swiss

19702,the present research is the first comprehensive study regarding the thermophilic anaerobic degradation of cheese wastewater which combines the evaluation of different reactor configurations i e single and two stage continuous stirred tank reactors on the process efficiency and the in depth characterization of the microbial community structure using genome centric metagenomics both reactor configurations showed acidification problems under the tested organic loading rates olrs of 3 6 and 2 4 g cod l reactor day and the hydraulic retention time hrt of 15 days however the two stage design reached a methane yield equal to 95 of the theoretical value in contrast with the single stage configuration which reached a maximum of 33 of the theoretical methane yield the metagenomic analysis identified 22 new population genomes and revealed that the microbial compositions between the two configurations were remarkably different demonstrating a higher methanogenic biodiversity in the two stage configuration in fact the acidogenic reactor of the serial configuration was almost solely composed by the lactose degrader bifidobacterium crudilactis uc0001 the predictive functional analyses of the main population genomes highlighted specific metabolic pathways responsible for the ad process and the mechanisms of main intermediates production particularly the acetate accumulation experienced by the single stage configuration was mainly correlated to the low abundant syntrophic acetate oxidizer tepidanaerobacter acetatoxydans uc0018 and to the absence of aceticlastic

configuration r3 methanogenic reactor of the two stage configuration 1 introduction the dairy industry consists of several production divisions each one of them generating considerable amounts of effluent wastewater streams especially during the cheese making process different types of residues are discarded at various steps of the production chain cheese whey permeate wp is a by product originating from the cheese manufacturing process during the step of proteins recovery by ultrafiltration and or diafiltration it mainly contains lactose and therefore is often used to standardize the nutritional composition and taste of milk however in most cases wp is not exploited and thus is considered as high strength wastewater i e bod5 cod ratio is usually higher than 0 5 prazeres et al 2012 it is estimated that the annual production of wp at global scale can be over 108 tons per year grba et al 2002 a less known waste derives from the portioning and shaving phases of hard cheese manufacturing process and it consists in a cheese powder waste cp which mainly contains proteins and fats especially in italy the production of two protected designation of origin pdo hard cheeses grana padano and parmigiano reggiano counted more than 182 000 t and 137 000 t respectively in 2015 ismea 2016 these volumes suggest a considerable amount of waste derived from each cheese mould from the above it is obvious that the residues of dairy industry require an effective treatment before their disposal to the final recipients several biological treatments have been proposed to process wp including anaerobic digestion ad lactose hydrolysis ethanol hydrogen or lactic acid fermentations enzyme production and microbial fuel cells cota navarro et al 2011 prazeres et al 2012 schirru et al 2014 among them ad for biogas production is considered as a sustainable solution for waste valorization and energy recovery ad is a complex biological process involving different microbial consortia to break down organic matter into several by products and finally to biogas which is mainly composed by methane and carbon dioxide this overall process consists of four steps namely hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis batstone et al 2008 the resulting methane can be used for electricity and thermal energy generation or by performing additional purification steps biomethane can substitute natural gas kougias et al 2017 nevertheless the high sodium content acidic ph and low alkalinity of wp hampers its treatment by biological processes backus et al 1988 ghaly 1996 castelló et al 2009 in order to overcome such technical challenges different reactor configurations stamatelatou et al 2014 were tested or co digestion strategies were employed in order to efficiently degrade wastewater from cheese making processes gelegenis et al 2007 hagen et al 2014 the majority of these studies have been performed under mesophilic conditions and the few works reporting thermophilic reactor operation are focusing on simultaneous production of h2 and ch4 in two steps fernandez et al 2015 kisielewska et al 2014 however it is well known that thermophilic conditions even if they are more sensitive to inhibitors pose several advantages in biogas production such as higher methane production rates and shorter hydraulic retention times harris and dague 1993 wiegant et al 1986 zinder et al 1984 to the best of our knowledge information regarding thermophilic operation of anaerobic reactors fed exclusively with cheese wastewater and by products for biogas production is missing another crucial parameter which determines the degradation efficiency of these wastes is the microbial consortium involved in the ad process understanding the diversity and dynamics of such community will lead to process optimization by calibrating operational parameters and by enhancing preferred microbial pathways which will result in higher ch4 yields a way to achieve this goal is via genome centric metagenomics which employs shotgun sequencing de novo assembly of the obtained reads and binning of the scaffolds in population genomes campanaro et al 2016 this study aims to compare the efficiency of two thermophilic reactor configurations single and two stage continuous stirred tank reactors cstrs on the anaerobic degradability of a mixture of cheese wastes namely wp and cp furthermore we analyzed the reactors metagenomes via total random sequencing trs and metagenomic binning strategy functional analyses of the main population genomes pgs were also carried out in order to highlight possible connections with the main intermediates produced along the process such as volatile fatty acids vfas 2 materials and methods 2 1 substrates characterization and feedstock preparation the cheese whey permeate was obtained from arla denmark and stored at 20 c in 2 l bottles the grana padano pdo cheese waste powder from the portioning phase of manufacturing process was obtained from colla s p a italy and stored in vacuum sealed bags at 4 c before usage the whey permeate was thawed at 4 c for 1 2 days the feedstock was prepared by mixing the two substrates by hands and it was kept homogenized with a magnetic stirrer during the feeding times the chemical composition of each substrate and mixed feedstock are shown in table 1 2 2 reactors configurations and process parameters the setup consisted of a single r1 and a two stage cstrs r2 and r3 respectively each setup had a total working volume of 3 l the working volume of the two stage configuration was split between the acidogenic reactor r2 0 6 l and the methanogenic reactor r3 2 4 l each reactor was filled with inoculum obtained from snertinge thermophilic biogas plant denmark which is mainly fed with livestock manure pig and cattle and wastes from food industry the inoculum had a ph of 8 1 total solids ts and volatile solids vs content of 31 71 0 04 and 21 45 0 05

by magnetic stirrers stirring intensity equal to 150 rpm and were kept at thermophilic conditions 55 1 c using thermal jackets r1 and r2 were fed four times per day with a mixture of whey permeate wp and cheese powder cp while r3 was fed with the effluent from r2 each time the reactors were fed with fresh substrate equal volume of effluent digestate was removed from the reactors by pneumatic pressure the hydraulic retention time hrt was set at 15 days for both configurations split in 3 and 12 days in r2 and r3 respectively the organic loading rates olrs tested were initially 3 6 g cod l reactor day phase i then due to acidification problems 2 4 g cod l reactor day phase ii sodium bicarbonate addition in r1 and r3 was applied whenever the ph dropped below 6 5 2 3 analytical methods the daily biogas production of r1 single stage reactor and r3 methanogenic reactor of the two stage configuration were measured by an automated gas meter angelidaki et al 1992 total solids ts volatile solids vs chemical oxygen demand cod ph ammonium nitrogen nh4 n and total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn were measured according to the standard methods apha 2005 samples from reactors were collected for ph and vfa analyses twice per week vfa samples were determined using a gas chromatograph gc 2010 shimadzu with a flame ionization detector and ffap column as described previously kougias et al 2013 lactic acid concentration was measured by hplc agilent 1100 with a biorad aminex hpx 87h column using 4 mm h2so4 as eluent at a flow rate of 0 6 ml min the biogas composition was measured twice per week using a gas chromatograph with a thermal conductivity detector gc tcd as described by kougias et al 2014 the biochemical methane potential bmp of the substrate was determined following the protocol described by angelidaki et al 2009 and the measurements were carried out by a gas chromatograph with a flame ionization detector fid as described previously kougias et al 2015 macronutrients were measured via inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes after the thermochemical pretreatment of 0 25 g freeze dried sample in particular 9 ml of 65 nitric acid 3 ml of 37 hydrochloric acid and 0 5 ml of 30 hydrogen peroxide were used to digest the sample along with treatment in a microwave unit the mixture was then centrifuged and diluted prior analysis all analyses

bubble size 60 gene finding was performed with prodigal v2 6 2 run in metagenomic mode hyatt et al 2012 genes were annotated according to kegg using ghostkoala kanehisa et al 2016 and to eggnog 4 5 1 using eggnog mapper huerta cepas et al 2016 scaffolds were binned into population genomes pgs using two strategies metabat v0 25 4 parameters specific m 1500 kang et al 2015 and the hierarchical clustering followed by canopy profile selection hccp campanaro et al 2016 in order to improve the binning strategies the coverage profile of the scaffolds was determined by aligning the shotgun sequences derived from other projects on the assembly only samples providing a percentage of aligned sequences higher than 20 were considered kougias et al 2016 treu et al 2016 completeness and contamination of the pgs were estimated using lineage wf workflow of checkm and the pgs obtained from the two approaches were compared using the bin compare module of the same software parks et al 2015 pgs identified using both binning strategies were retained from the hccp procedure for all the pgs gene prediction was improved comparing results from two different software prodigal hyatt et al 2012 and genemarks besemer et al 2001 and merging the final results with a perl script previously described campanaro et al 2014 functional analysis of the pgs was based on kegg annotation via foam software prestat et al 2014 module completion ratio mcr in each functional module of the kegg database was evaluated using maple 2 3 0 http www genome jp tools maple help html taxonomical assignment for the pgs was achieved by comparing results from phylophlan v0 99 segata et al 2013 checkm parks et al 2015 and the 16s rrna taxonomic assignment obtained according to the blastn results from the ncbi 16s ribosomal database the presence of genomes belonging to the same species in the ncbi microbial genome database and in pgs recovered in previous assemblies was determined using average nucleotide identity ani calculation as previously described campanaro et al 2017 abundance of genes and pgs in different reactors was considered as directly related to scaffold coverage as previously described campanaro et al 2014 coverage values determined for pgs were visualized with mev saeed et al 2003 raw sequence data have been deposited at sequence read archive sra under the bioproject prjna394669 and the accessions samn07367931 samn07367939 3 results and discussion 3 1 reactors process monitoring and configurations comparison considering the first operation phase during which the olr was set to 3 6 g cod l reactor day both configurations single and two stage showed increased instability in terms of ch4 yield fig 1 such instabilities can be mostly addressed to the difficulties in maintaining the cp well homogenized in the permeate fraction this can provoke irregular organic daily loads in particular of the insoluble cp lipid fraction which could have affected the methanogenic community it has been previously found that lipid toxicity is higher under thermophilic conditions especially concerning acetate utilizing methanogens hwu and lettinga 1997 in addition process over acidification fig 2 related to the feed characteristics could also be involved in the performance instability indeed the acidic ph and the lack of buffer capacity of the whey permeate caused abrupt drops in ph which could affect specific members of the microbial consortia involved in the ad food chain resulting in slower metabolic activities ahring et al 1995 indeed total vfas concentration increased in r1 and r3 accumulating mostly acetate and butyrate fig 2 this increment can inhibit specific taxa of acetogenic bacteria or methanogenic archaea decelerating the whole process and affecting the methane yield it is worth noting that the low concentration of propionate less than 1 g l in r1 and r3 indicates an efficient syntrophic association between the propionate degraders which produce acetate and h2 and the methanogenic communities kim et al 2002 van lier et al 1993 despite the addition of sodium bicarbonate to recover the ph in a suitable range for methanogenesis the process remained unstable for both configurations in addition to the lipid toxicity effect the over acidification that was concurrently experienced after day 66 in both r1 and r3 reactors could be also related to an inhibitory action provoked by the concentration of potassium in the feed table 2 it was previously observed that k at concentrations higher than 0 4 g l can inhibit particularly the aceticlastic methanogens kugelman and mccarty 1965 this inhibition was also reported at higher extent under thermophilic conditions kugelman and mccarty 1965 in order to overcome the problems due to the feed characteristics which led to process instabilities in terms of methane production phase i fig 1 the olr was reduced to 2 4 g cod l reactor day phase ii fig 1 the decrease of the olr managed to improve the efficiency of the two stage configuration which maintained a stable profile in terms of ch4 yield 300 33 ml ch4 g codadded corresponding to a maximum of 95 of the theoretical value angelidaki et al 2011 fig 1 on the contrary the single stage reactor exhibited ph instability showing a further increase in acetate concentration up to 10 g l fig 2 despite the addition of sodium bicarbonate for the maintenance of ph values over 6 5 the reactor was performing at an inhibited steady state condition 100 16 ml ch4 g codadded reaching a maximum of 33 of the theoretical ch4 yield the higher process efficiency of the two stage configuration could be mainly due to the pre acidification step occurring in r2 similar findings were also found in a mesophilic cstr uasb system digesting diluted cheese whey diamantis et al 2014 the acidogenic reactor r2 maintained a stable ph i e 3 9 0 1 all along the duration of the process moreover the concentration of vfas was stabilized after the olr reduction phase ii having values between 4 5 and 7 g l fig 2 butyrate was the intermediate compound showing the highest accumulation level 3 5 1 1 g l followed by acetate 1 6 0 4 g l whereas propionate was almost absent the vfas composition of r2 could have also favored the two stage performance since butyrate and acetate were found to be the best precursors for methane production mccarty and smith 1986 stronach et al 1986 speece 1996 moreover the lack of propionate in this reactor probably contributed to avoid potential toxicity effects on the methanogenic community of r3 barredo and evison 1991 3 2 genome centric metagenomics and predictive functional analyses the obtained assembly had a total length of more than 160 mbp n50 5442 indicating that almost the total community was represented in the assembled scaffolds since it included 86 99 of the reads depending on sample to assign a putative functional role to the species present a genome centric approach was applied to the assembly the binning strategy assigned the scaffolds to the microbial species and identified 50 pgs 19 of them having estimated completeness higher than 90 and average contamination around 2 the success of the applied strategy is highlighted by the high percentage of scaffolds that were assigned to a genome with only few left unassigned less than 40 the presence of previously sequenced genomes identified in the present project was verified by comparing the reconstructed pgs of this study with the genome sequences deposited in the microbial genome resources ncbi and reported in previous genome centric investigations kougias et al 2016 treu et al 2016 mosbaek et al 2016 stolze et al 2016 vanwonterghem et al 2016 from this analysis it was found that 12 pgs were assigned to known species 16 were identified in previous genome centric studies and 22 pgs were newly identified the new pgs were mostly assigned to clostridia class and none of them was classified at species level investigation of the proteins function and identification of the metabolic pathways encoded in the pgs allowed to draw some correlations between the abundance of the pgs and the presence of key metabolic intermediates for practical reasons only the highly abundant and most complete pgs were selected in this analysis coverage 3 and completeness 70 subsequently by selecting the pathways having completeness higher than 70 it was possible to obtain a single species level metabolic reconstruction fig a4 the microbial consortium established in the reactors under investigation was a result of the physico chemical characteristics of the feed namely acidic ph and presence of lactose as the main carbon source indeed the bacterial community of the current study was found to be remarkably different compared to previously investigated ad microbiomes even if the same thermophilic inoculum was used bassani et al 2015 campanaro et al 2016 fig 3 the predictive functional analysis based on kegg annotation showed that the higher biodiversity found in the two stage configuration including both bacteria and archaea fig 3 resulted in a higher number of abc transporters 27 for amino acids and lipo oligosaccharides intake as well as genes involved in amino acids and fatty acid metabolisms 65 thus it can be assumed that a wider range of intermediate compounds were available as feed for the microbial consortia of the serial cstrs 3 2 1 single stage reactor r1 the single stage reactor r1 showed a dominance of three phyla firmicutes 57 synergistetes 21 and thermotogae 17 fig a1a it is worth noticing the absence of the phylum bacteroidetes which is generally one of the most abundant phylum in biogas reactors around 10 frequently involved in the hydrolytic step of ad campanaro et al 2016 fontana et al 2016 luo et al 2016 stolze et al 2016 interestingly each phylum identified in r1 was represented by a single species highlighting the effect of feedstock on the bacterial population established in the reactor fig 3a despite the differences between the configurations the two methanogenic reactors r1 and r3 shared a microbial core composed by four bacteria species fig 4 coprothermobacter proteolyticus sp uc0011 defluviitoga tunisiensis uc0050 anaerobaculum hydrogeniformans uc0046 and clostridiales sp uc0015 these pgs were previously associated to the hydrolytic step of the thermophilic anaerobic digesters campanaro et al 2016 maune and tanner 2012 maus et al 2016 sasaki et al 2011 in r1 the species defluviitoga tunisiensis uc0050 and clostridiales sp uc0015 belonging to thermotogae and firmicutes phyla respectively were the main responsible for lactose fermentation in particular the eggnog functional analysis predicted in both species the presence of all the subunits composing the malefg transporter which allows the import of disaccharides including lactose in the cell the presence of this transporter in defluviitoga tunisiensis was also supported by previous studies maus et al 2016 the continuous lactose fermentation led to the production of acetate fig 5 however the absence of aceticlastic methanogens in r1 and the low abundance of syntrophic acetate oxidizing bacteria such as tepidanaerobacter acetatoxydans uc0018 resulted in accumulation of acetic acid and concomitantly deterioration of the ad process tepidanaerobacter acetatoxydans was previously isolated from an ammonium rich mesophilic cstr fed with silage westerholm et al 2011 the functional analysis of uc0018 showed a complete wood ljungdahl w l pathway fig a4 and a5 in which the reducing equivalents generated from the glycolysis are re oxidized by the reduction of two molecules of co2 to acetate the eggnog analysis confirmed the presence of genes encoding the enzymes involved in the pathway from the co2 reduction to the acetate formation fig 5 it is worth noticing that an inefficient h2 removal by h2 scavengers such as hydrogenotrophic methanogens could have affected the metabolic activity of tepidanaerobacter acetatoxydans uc0018 from acetate oxidizer to acetate producer müller et al 2015 participating to the acetate accumulation occurred in r1 focusing on the archaeal community in r1 the abundance was approximately around 2 fig a2a similarly to values found in reactors fed with other substrates luo et al 2016 stolze et al 2016 the reactor was dominated by one class of methanogens namely methanobacteria which represented the 87 of the total archaeal population fig a3a the instability of the ph in r1 frequently led to over acidification reaching values lower than 6 5 it could be hypothesized that this effect reduced the biodiversity of the methanogenic community which generally grow in a ph range of 6 5 8 5 weiland 2010 this unfavorable environment allowed mostly the growth of one species methanothermobacter wolfeii uc0008 fig 4 which can utilize h2 co2 or formate as the sole carbon and energy source wasserfallen et al 2000 however even if in lower abundance it was also found another hydrogenotrophic methanogens methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus uc0010 wasserfallen et al 2000 fig 4 the difficulties exhibited by r1 to maintain the ph in the optimum range led to a partial inhibition of the methanogenic hydrogenotrophic activity hampering syntrophic associations for acetate disposal moreover it is worth highlighting that the absence of acetate scavengers such as aceticlastic methanogens can be the consequence of a lipid toxicity effect which is more evident in a single stage configuration than in a two stage design moreover the lack of acetate utilizing methanogens in r1 can be one of the principal explanations for the higher acetate concentration reached in this reactor 3 2 2 two stage acidogenic reactor r2 the bacterial selection imposed by the feed was particularly evident in the acidogenic reactor of the serial configuration r2 which specifically represented the hydrolytic and acidogenic phases of the ad process in this reactor actinobacteria was the most abundant taxon 82 fig a1b even though it generally accounts as minor fraction in ad reactors campanaro et al 2016 fontana et al 2016 this phylum was composed by a single species bifidobacterium crudilactis uc0001 a pg very similar to species previously isolated from raw milk and raw milk cheeses delcenserie et al 2007 uc0001 was the main responsible for lactose fermentation in the reactor showing a complete pathway for galactose degradation including the enzyme β galactosidase lacz responsible for lactose hydrolysis fig 5 and fig a4 the ability of b crudilactis to import lactose in the cell and then acidify it was also described by delcenserie et al 2007 the reactor r2 was additionally populated by other species present in lower abundance such as pseudomonas lundensis uc0042 and leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides uc0016 7 and 5 respectively fig 3b the functional analysis of pseudomonas lundensis uc0042 revealed a complete β oxidation pathway fig a4 in particular it exhibited a set of proteins correlated to acetyl coa production and its subsequent conversion into butanoyl coa fig 5 and fig a7 explaining the presence of butyrate at high concentration in r2 this metabolic activity was also supported by morales et al 2005 who identified a high production of butyrate in milk inoculated with p lundensis the metabolic reconstruction of this species also supported the presence of pathways involved in amino acids degradation namely methionine histidine tyrosine and leucine a deeper analysis performed using eggnogg annotation showed that this pg encoded 21 proteases among which some secreted e g subtilisin these results suggested a crucial role of pseudomonas lundensis uc0042 in the degradation of proteins present in the feeding substrate this reactor also showed a higher abundance of clostridiaceae spp and in particular of clostridium spp fig 3b which could have contributed to the sugars degradation in r2 hung et al 2011 the remarkably different microbial composition exhibited by this reactor indicates a higher specialization in the hydrolytic and acidogenic activities which might have contributed to the higher process efficiency of the two stage configuration as expected no archaea were found in r2 since the ph was prohibitive for methanogenic growth 3 9 0 1 weiland 2010 fig a2b 3 2 3 two stage methanogenic reactor r3 the methanogenic reactor of the serial configuration r3 presented the highest microbial richness when compared to the other reactors fig a1c this divergence could be mainly due to the feed of r3 which was mainly composed by the vfas produced in the acidogenic reactor r2 resulting in different metabolic activities and functionalities in the two configurations among bacterial population bacteroidetes phylum 11 abundance was included and represented by only one species bacteroidetes sp uc0002 fig 3c differently from other pgs belonging to the bacteroidetes phylum in previous studies campanaro et al 2016 luo et al 2016 stolze et al 2016 the predictive functional investigation performed on bacteroidetes sp uc0002 did not classify it to the hydrolytic step of the ad food chain but assigned a role in amino acids intake and degradation as well as in fatty acids biosynthesis moreover from the kegg functional analysis was suggested an ability of bacteroidetes sp uc0002 to perform the reductive tca cycle by encoding five fundamental enzymes fdr suc icd aco pc fig 5 and fig a8 it is worth noticing the high abundances of syntrophomonas sp uc0014 and syntrophaceticus sp uc0017 in r3 fig 3c uc0014 was one of the pgs together with p lundensis uc0042 in r2 having a complete β oxidation pathway fig a4 this suggested an involvement of syntrophomonas sp uc0014 in the syntrophic oxidation of the butyrate produced in the acidogenic reactor r2 into acetate fig 5 and fig a9 considering syntrophaceticus sp uc0017 its functional analysis revealed a complete wood ljungdahl w l pathway which can be likely utilized in the oxidative direction fig 5 and fig a10 it was demonstrated that strictly related species such as s schinkii can oxidize acetate to hydrogen and or formate whose usage by hydrogenotrophic methanogens makes the reaction energetically favored manzoor et al 2015 it is interesting to note the specific presence 4 of chloroflexi spp in r3 fig 3c despite the metabolic functions of bacteria belonging to this group are still poorly characterized few studies established the potential role of chloroflexi spp in carbohydrates degradation ariesyady et al 2007 even though the archaeal abundance was comparable between the two configurations approximately 2 fig a 2a a 2c r3 had a more biodiverse population of methanogens that were assigned to three different classes fig a3 namely methanobacteria 38 methanomicrobia 34 thermoplasmata 28 they correspond to a core population of three equally abundant methanogens methanothermobacter wolfeii uc0008 methanosarcina thermophila uc0006 and methanomassiliicoccus sp uc0009 fig 4 methanomassiliicoccus species can produce methane by reducing methanol with hydrogen dridi et al 2012 but they can also utilize methylamines to perform methylotrophic methanogenesis poulsen et al 2013 methanosarcina thermophila can instead utilize acetate methanol methylamines and h2 co2 zinder et al 1985 the h2 generated from the β oxidation pathway performed by syntrophomonas sp uc0014 can be transferred to hydrogenotrophic methanogens such as methanothermobacter wolfeii uc0008 and the generalist methanosarcina thermophila uc0006 which act as h2 sinks and support the syntrophic association between species utilization of h2 by the archaea shifts the reaction equilibrium towards acetate oxidation increasing the energy gain of the bacterial species sieber et al 2010 stams and plugge 2009 the higher biodiversity in methanogenic taxa could be one of the reasons why r3 was more efficient since a wider range of metabolic intermediates can be converted to methane this could avoid the accumulation of specific compounds such acetate which concentration was found to be remarkably increased in the single stage reactor configuration r1 4 conclusions in conclusion this study allowed gaining new insights on the anaerobic digestion of dairy wastes identifying constraints about reactor configurations and highlighting the main metabolic players of the complex microbial consortia the superior performance of the two stage configuration was mainly due to the pre acidification step which allowed a better distribution of the microbial species in suitable habitat for their metabolic activities in particular bifidobacterium crudilactis uc0001 was the main lactose degrader in the acidogenic phase of ad whereas a wider set of methanogenic archaea methanothermobacter wolfeii uc0008 methanosarcina thermophila uc0006 and methanomassiliicoccus sp uc0009 was responsible for the higher methane yield reached by the serial configuration moreover it was evident that the acetate concentration exhibited by the single stage reactor was mainly due to the lack of aceticlastic methanogens and to the partial inhibition of the methanogenic hydrogen scavengers methanothermobacter wolfeii uc0008 and methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus uc0010 hampering the activity of the low abundant syntrophic acetate oxidizer species such as tepidanaerobacter acetatoxydans uc0018 the findings of this work can be further utilized for development of reactor designs aiming high rate yield methane production from dairy wastewater and serve as complementary foundation for deciphering the biogas microbiome

19702,the present research is the first comprehensive study regarding the thermophilic anaerobic degradation of cheese wastewater which combines the evaluation of different reactor configurations i e single and two stage continuous stirred tank reactors on the process efficiency and the in depth characterization of the microbial community structure using genome centric metagenomics both reactor configurations showed acidification problems under the tested organic loading rates olrs of 3 6 and 2 4 g cod l reactor day and the hydraulic retention time hrt of 15 days however the two stage design reached a methane yield equal to 95 of the theoretical value in contrast with the single stage configuration which reached a maximum of 33 of the theoretical methane yield the metagenomic analysis identified 22 new population genomes and revealed that the microbial compositions between the two configurations were remarkably different demonstrating a higher methanogenic biodiversity in the two stage configuration in fact the acidogenic reactor of the serial configuration was almost solely composed by the lactose degrader bifidobacterium crudilactis uc0001 the predictive functional analyses of the main population genomes highlighted specific metabolic pathways responsible for the ad process and the mechanisms of main intermediates production particularly the acetate accumulation experienced by the single stage configuration was mainly correlated to the low abundant syntrophic acetate oxidizer tepidanaerobacter acetatoxydans uc0018 and to the absence of aceticlastic methanogens graphical abstract image 1 keywords thermophilic anaerobic digestion dairy wastes acidogenesis metagenomics syntrophisms methanogens abbreviations wp whey permeate cp cheese powder ad anaerobic digestion vfa volatile fatty acid cstr continuous stirred tank reactor trs total random sequencing pg population genome r1 single stage reactor r2 acidogenic reactor of the two stage configuration r3 methanogenic reactor of the two stage configuration 1 introduction the dairy industry consists of several production divisions each one of them generating considerable amounts of effluent wastewater streams especially during the cheese making process different types of residues are discarded at various steps of the production chain cheese whey permeate wp is a by product originating from the cheese manufacturing process during the step of proteins recovery by ultrafiltration and or diafiltration it mainly contains lactose and therefore is often used to standardize the nutritional composition and taste of milk however in most cases wp is not exploited and thus is considered as high strength wastewater i e bod5 cod ratio is usually higher than 0 5 prazeres et al 2012 it is estimated that the annual production of wp at global scale can be over 108 tons per year grba et al 2002 a less known waste derives from the portioning and shaving phases of hard cheese manufacturing process and it consists in a cheese powder waste cp which mainly contains proteins and fats especially in italy the production of two protected designation of origin pdo hard cheeses grana padano and parmigiano reggiano counted more than 182 000 t and 137 000 t respectively in 2015 ismea 2016 these volumes suggest a considerable amount of waste derived from each cheese mould from the above it is obvious that the residues of dairy industry require an effective treatment before their disposal to the final recipients several biological treatments have been proposed to process wp including anaerobic digestion ad lactose hydrolysis ethanol hydrogen or lactic acid fermentations enzyme production and microbial fuel cells cota navarro et al 2011 prazeres et al 2012 schirru et al 2014 among them ad for biogas production is considered as a sustainable solution for waste valorization and energy recovery ad is a complex biological process involving different microbial consortia to break down organic matter into several by products and finally to biogas which is mainly composed by methane and carbon dioxide this overall process consists of four steps namely hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis batstone et al 2008 the resulting methane can be used for electricity and thermal energy generation or by performing additional purification steps biomethane can substitute natural gas kougias et al 2017 nevertheless the high sodium content acidic ph and low alkalinity of wp hampers its treatment by biological processes backus et al 1988 ghaly 1996 castelló et al 2009 in order to overcome such technical challenges different reactor configurations stamatelatou et al 2014 were tested or co digestion strategies were employed in order to efficiently degrade wastewater from cheese making processes gelegenis et al 2007 hagen et al 2014 the majority of these studies have been performed under mesophilic conditions and the few works reporting thermophilic reactor operation are focusing on simultaneous production of h2 and ch4 in two steps fernandez et al 2015 kisielewska et al 2014 however it is well known that thermophilic conditions even if they are more sensitive to inhibitors pose several advantages in biogas production such as higher methane production rates and shorter hydraulic retention times harris and dague 1993 wiegant et al 1986 zinder et al 1984 to the best of our knowledge information regarding thermophilic operation of anaerobic reactors fed exclusively with cheese wastewater and by products for biogas production is missing another crucial parameter which determines the degradation efficiency of these wastes is the microbial consortium involved in the ad process understanding the diversity and dynamics of such community will lead to process optimization by calibrating operational parameters and by enhancing preferred microbial pathways which will result in higher ch4 yields a way to achieve this goal is via genome centric metagenomics which employs shotgun sequencing de novo assembly of the obtained reads and binning of the scaffolds in population genomes campanaro et al 2016 this study aims to compare the efficiency of two thermophilic reactor configurations single and two stage continuous stirred tank reactors cstrs on the anaerobic degradability of a mixture of cheese wastes namely wp and cp furthermore we analyzed the reactors metagenomes via total random sequencing trs and metagenomic binning strategy functional analyses of the main population genomes pgs were also carried out in order to highlight possible connections with the main intermediates produced along the process such as volatile fatty acids vfas 2 materials and methods 2 1 substrates characterization and feedstock preparation the cheese whey permeate was obtained from arla denmark and stored at 20 c in 2 l bottles the grana padano pdo cheese waste powder from the portioning phase of manufacturing process was obtained from colla s p a italy and stored in vacuum sealed bags at 4 c before usage the whey permeate was thawed at 4 c for 1 2 days the feedstock was prepared by mixing the two substrates by hands and it was kept homogenized with a magnetic stirrer during the feeding times the chemical composition of each substrate and mixed feedstock are shown in table 1 2 2 reactors configurations and process parameters the setup consisted of a single r1 and a two stage cstrs r2 and r3 respectively each setup had a total working volume of 3 l the working volume of the two stage configuration was split between the acidogenic reactor r2 0 6 l and the methanogenic reactor r3 2 4 l each reactor was filled with inoculum obtained from snertinge thermophilic biogas plant denmark which is mainly fed with livestock manure pig and cattle and wastes from food industry the inoculum had a ph of 8 1 total solids ts and volatile solids vs content of 31 71 0 04 and 21 45 0 05 g l respectively the total volatile fatty acids vfas total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn and ammonium nitrogen nh4 n concentrations were 0 13 0 02 3 78 0 01 3 15 0 01 g l respectively the reactors were mixed by magnetic stirrers stirring intensity equal to 150 rpm and were kept at thermophilic conditions 55 1 c using thermal jackets r1 and r2 were fed four times per day with a mixture of whey permeate wp and cheese powder cp while r3 was fed with the effluent from r2 each time the reactors were fed with fresh substrate equal volume of effluent digestate was removed from the reactors by pneumatic pressure the hydraulic retention time hrt was set at 15 days for both configurations split in 3 and 12 days in r2 and r3 respectively the organic loading rates olrs tested were initially 3 6 g cod l reactor day phase i then due to acidification problems 2 4 g cod l reactor day phase ii sodium bicarbonate addition in r1 and r3 was applied whenever the ph dropped below 6 5 2 3 analytical methods the daily biogas production of r1 single stage reactor and r3 methanogenic reactor of the two stage configuration were measured by an automated gas meter angelidaki et al 1992 total solids ts volatile solids vs chemical oxygen demand cod ph ammonium nitrogen nh4 n and total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn were measured according to the standard methods apha 2005 samples from reactors were collected for ph and vfa analyses twice per week vfa samples were determined using a gas chromatograph gc 2010 shimadzu with a flame ionization detector and ffap column as described previously kougias et al 2013 lactic acid concentration was measured by hplc agilent 1100 with a biorad aminex hpx 87h column using 4 mm h2so4 as eluent at a flow rate of 0 6 ml min the biogas composition was measured twice per week using a gas chromatograph with a thermal conductivity detector gc tcd as described by kougias et al 2014 the biochemical methane potential bmp of the substrate was determined following the protocol described by angelidaki et al 2009 and the measurements were carried out by a gas chromatograph with a flame ionization detector fid as described previously kougias et al 2015 macronutrients were measured via inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes after the thermochemical pretreatment of 0 25 g freeze dried sample in particular 9 ml of 65 nitric acid 3 ml of 37 hydrochloric acid and 0 5 ml of 30 hydrogen peroxide were used to digest the sample along with treatment in a microwave unit the mixture was then centrifuged and diluted prior analysis all analyses were performed in replicate samples 2 4 metagenomic sequencing and microbial communities analyses triplicate samples were taken at the reactors steady state conditions of phase ii and genomic dna was

filtering and adaptors removal were carried out using trimmomatic software v0 33 bolger et al 2014 de novo assembly was executed by clc genomics workbench v 5 1 clc bio aarhus dk usa using kmer 63 and bubble size 60 gene finding was performed with prodigal v2 6 2 run in metagenomic mode hyatt et al 2012 genes were annotated according to kegg using ghostkoala kanehisa et al 2016 and to eggnog 4 5 1 using eggnog mapper huerta cepas et al 2016 scaffolds were binned into population genomes pgs using two strategies metabat v0 25 4 parameters specific m 1500 kang et al 2015 and the hierarchical clustering followed by canopy profile selection hccp campanaro et al 2016 in order to improve the binning strategies the coverage profile of the scaffolds was determined by aligning the shotgun sequences derived from other projects on the assembly only samples providing a percentage of aligned sequences higher than 20 were considered kougias et al 2016 treu et al 2016 completeness and contamination of the pgs were estimated using lineage wf workflow of checkm and the pgs obtained from the two approaches were compared using the bin compare module of the same software parks et al 2015 pgs identified using both binning strategies were retained from the hccp procedure for all the pgs gene prediction was improved comparing results from two different software prodigal hyatt et al 2012 and genemarks besemer et al 2001 and merging the final results with a perl script previously described campanaro et al 2014 functional analysis of the pgs was based on kegg annotation via foam software prestat et al 2014 module completion ratio mcr in each functional module of the kegg database was evaluated using maple 2 3 0 http www genome jp tools maple help html taxonomical assignment for the pgs was achieved by comparing results from phylophlan v0 99 segata et al 2013 checkm parks et al 2015 and the 16s rrna taxonomic assignment obtained according to the blastn results from the ncbi 16s ribosomal database the presence of genomes belonging to the same species in the ncbi microbial genome database and in pgs recovered in previous assemblies was determined using average nucleotide identity ani calculation as previously described campanaro et al 2017 abundance of genes and pgs in different reactors was considered as directly related to scaffold coverage as previously described campanaro et al 2014 coverage values determined for pgs were visualized with mev saeed et al 2003 raw sequence data have been deposited at sequence read archive sra under the bioproject prjna394669 and the accessions samn07367931 samn07367939 3 results and discussion 3 1 reactors process monitoring and configurations comparison considering the first operation phase during which the olr was set to 3 6 g cod l reactor day both configurations single and two stage showed increased instability in terms of ch4 yield fig 1 such instabilities can be mostly addressed to the difficulties in maintaining the cp well homogenized in the permeate fraction this can provoke irregular organic daily loads in particular of the insoluble cp lipid fraction which could have affected the methanogenic community it has been previously found that lipid toxicity is higher under thermophilic conditions especially concerning acetate utilizing methanogens hwu and lettinga 1997 in addition process over acidification fig 2 related to the feed characteristics could also be involved in the performance instability indeed the acidic ph and the lack of buffer capacity of the whey permeate caused abrupt drops in ph which could affect specific members of the microbial consortia involved in the ad food chain resulting in slower metabolic activities ahring et al 1995 indeed total vfas concentration increased in r1 and r3 accumulating mostly acetate and butyrate fig 2 this increment can inhibit specific taxa of acetogenic bacteria or methanogenic archaea decelerating the whole process and affecting the methane yield it is worth noting that the low concentration of propionate less than 1 g l in r1 and r3 indicates an efficient syntrophic association between the propionate degraders which produce acetate and h2 and the methanogenic communities kim et al 2002 van lier et al 1993 despite the addition of sodium bicarbonate to recover the ph in a suitable range for methanogenesis the process remained unstable for both configurations in addition to the lipid toxicity effect the over acidification that was concurrently experienced after day 66 in both r1 and r3 reactors could be also related to an inhibitory action provoked by the concentration of potassium in the feed table 2 it was previously observed that k at concentrations higher than 0 4 g l can inhibit particularly the aceticlastic methanogens kugelman and mccarty 1965 this inhibition was also reported at higher extent under thermophilic conditions kugelman and mccarty 1965 in order to overcome the problems due to the feed characteristics which led to process instabilities in terms of methane production phase i fig 1 the olr was reduced to 2 4 g cod l reactor day phase ii fig 1 the decrease of the olr managed to improve the efficiency of the two stage configuration which maintained a stable profile in terms of ch4 yield 300 33 ml ch4 g codadded corresponding to a maximum of 95 of the theoretical value angelidaki et al 2011 fig 1 on the contrary the single stage reactor exhibited ph instability showing a further increase in acetate concentration up to 10 g l fig 2 despite the addition of sodium bicarbonate for the maintenance of ph values over 6 5 the reactor was performing at an inhibited steady state condition 100 16 ml ch4 g codadded reaching a maximum of 33 of the theoretical ch4 yield the higher process efficiency of the two stage configuration could be mainly due to the pre acidification step occurring in r2 similar findings were also found in a mesophilic cstr uasb system digesting diluted cheese whey diamantis et al 2014 the acidogenic reactor r2 maintained a stable ph i e 3 9 0 1 all along the duration of the process moreover the concentration of vfas was stabilized after the olr reduction phase ii having values between 4 5 and 7 g l fig 2 butyrate was the intermediate compound showing the highest accumulation level 3 5 1 1 g l followed by acetate 1 6 0 4 g l whereas propionate was almost absent the vfas composition of r2 could have also favored the two stage performance since butyrate and acetate were found to be the best precursors for methane production mccarty and smith 1986 stronach et al 1986 speece 1996 moreover the lack of propionate in this reactor probably contributed to avoid potential toxicity effects on the methanogenic community of r3 barredo and evison 1991 3 2 genome centric metagenomics and predictive functional analyses the obtained assembly had a total length of more than 160 mbp n50 5442 indicating that almost the total community was represented in the assembled scaffolds since it included 86 99 of the reads depending on sample to assign a putative functional role to the species present a genome centric approach was applied to the assembly the binning strategy assigned the scaffolds to the microbial species and identified 50 pgs 19 of them having estimated completeness higher than 90 and average contamination around 2 the success of the applied strategy is highlighted by the high percentage of scaffolds that were assigned to a genome with only few left unassigned less than 40 the presence of previously sequenced genomes identified in the present project was verified by comparing the reconstructed pgs of this study with the genome sequences deposited in the microbial genome resources ncbi and reported in previous genome centric investigations kougias et al 2016 treu et al 2016 mosbaek et al 2016 stolze et al 2016 vanwonterghem et al 2016 from this analysis it was found that 12 pgs were assigned to known species 16 were identified in previous genome centric studies and 22 pgs were newly identified the new pgs were mostly assigned to clostridia class and none of them was classified at species level investigation of the proteins function and identification of the metabolic pathways encoded in the pgs allowed to draw some correlations between the abundance of the pgs and the presence of key metabolic intermediates for practical reasons only the highly abundant and most complete pgs were selected in this analysis coverage 3 and completeness 70 subsequently by selecting the pathways having completeness higher than 70 it was possible to obtain a single species level metabolic reconstruction fig a4 the microbial consortium established in the reactors under investigation was a result of the physico chemical characteristics of the feed namely acidic ph and presence of lactose as the main carbon source indeed the bacterial community of the current study was found to be remarkably different compared to previously investigated ad microbiomes even if the same thermophilic inoculum was used bassani et al 2015 campanaro et al 2016 fig 3 the predictive functional analysis based on kegg annotation showed that the higher biodiversity found in the two stage configuration including both bacteria and archaea fig 3 resulted in a higher number of abc transporters 27 for amino acids and lipo oligosaccharides intake as well as genes involved in amino acids and fatty acid metabolisms 65 thus it can be assumed that a wider range of intermediate compounds were available as feed for the microbial consortia of the serial cstrs 3 2 1 single stage reactor r1 the single stage reactor r1 showed a dominance of three phyla firmicutes 57 synergistetes 21 and thermotogae 17 fig a1a it is worth noticing the absence of the phylum bacteroidetes which is generally one of the most abundant phylum in biogas reactors around 10 frequently involved in the hydrolytic step of ad campanaro et al 2016 fontana et al 2016 luo et al 2016 stolze et al 2016 interestingly each phylum identified in r1 was represented by a single species highlighting the effect of feedstock on the bacterial population established in the reactor fig 3a despite the differences between the configurations the two methanogenic reactors r1 and r3 shared a microbial core composed by four bacteria species fig 4 coprothermobacter proteolyticus sp uc0011 defluviitoga tunisiensis uc0050 anaerobaculum hydrogeniformans uc0046 and clostridiales sp uc0015 these pgs were previously associated to the hydrolytic step of the thermophilic anaerobic digesters campanaro et al 2016 maune and tanner 2012 maus et al 2016 sasaki et al 2011 in r1 the species defluviitoga tunisiensis uc0050 and clostridiales sp uc0015 belonging to thermotogae and firmicutes phyla respectively were the main responsible for lactose fermentation in particular the eggnog functional analysis predicted in both species the presence of all the subunits composing the malefg transporter which allows the import of disaccharides including lactose in the cell the presence of this transporter in defluviitoga tunisiensis was also supported by previous studies maus et al 2016 the continuous lactose fermentation led to the production of acetate fig 5 however the absence of aceticlastic methanogens in r1 and the low abundance of syntrophic acetate oxidizing bacteria such as tepidanaerobacter acetatoxydans uc0018 resulted in accumulation of acetic acid and concomitantly deterioration of the ad process tepidanaerobacter acetatoxydans was previously isolated from an ammonium rich mesophilic cstr fed with silage westerholm et al 2011 the functional analysis of uc0018 showed a complete wood ljungdahl w l pathway fig a4 and a5 in which the reducing equivalents generated from the glycolysis are re oxidized by the reduction of two molecules of co2 to acetate the eggnog analysis confirmed the presence of genes encoding the enzymes involved in the pathway from the co2 reduction to the acetate formation fig 5 it is worth noticing that an inefficient h2 removal by h2 scavengers such as hydrogenotrophic methanogens could have affected the metabolic activity of tepidanaerobacter acetatoxydans uc0018 from acetate oxidizer to acetate producer müller et al 2015 participating to the acetate accumulation occurred in r1 focusing on the archaeal community in r1 the abundance was approximately around 2 fig a2a similarly to values found in reactors fed with other substrates luo et al 2016 stolze et al 2016 the reactor was dominated by one class of methanogens namely methanobacteria which represented the 87 of the total archaeal population fig a3a the instability of the ph in r1 frequently led to over acidification reaching values lower than 6 5 it could be hypothesized that this effect reduced the biodiversity of the methanogenic community which generally grow in a ph range of 6 5 8 5 weiland 2010 this unfavorable environment allowed mostly the growth of one species methanothermobacter wolfeii uc0008 fig 4 which can utilize h2 co2 or formate as the sole carbon and energy source wasserfallen et al 2000 however even if in lower abundance it was also found another hydrogenotrophic methanogens methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus uc0010 wasserfallen et al 2000 fig 4 the difficulties exhibited by r1 to maintain the ph in the optimum range led to a partial inhibition of the methanogenic hydrogenotrophic activity hampering syntrophic associations for acetate disposal moreover it is worth highlighting that the absence of acetate scavengers such as aceticlastic methanogens can be the consequence of a lipid toxicity effect which is more evident in a single stage configuration than in a two stage design moreover the lack of acetate utilizing methanogens in r1 can be one of the principal explanations for the higher acetate concentration reached in this reactor 3 2 2 two stage acidogenic reactor r2 the bacterial selection imposed by the feed was particularly evident in the acidogenic reactor of the serial configuration r2 which specifically represented the hydrolytic and acidogenic phases of the ad process in this reactor actinobacteria was the most abundant taxon 82 fig a1b even though it generally accounts as minor fraction in ad reactors campanaro et al 2016 fontana et al 2016 this phylum was composed by a single species bifidobacterium crudilactis uc0001 a pg very similar to species previously isolated from raw milk and raw milk cheeses delcenserie et al 2007 uc0001 was the main responsible for lactose fermentation in the reactor showing a complete pathway for galactose degradation including the enzyme β galactosidase lacz responsible for lactose hydrolysis fig 5 and fig a4 the ability of b crudilactis to import lactose in the cell and then acidify it was also described by delcenserie et al 2007 the reactor r2 was additionally populated by other species present in lower abundance such as pseudomonas lundensis uc0042 and leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides uc0016 7 and 5 respectively fig 3b the functional analysis of pseudomonas lundensis uc0042 revealed a complete β oxidation pathway fig a4 in particular it exhibited a set of proteins correlated to acetyl coa production and its subsequent conversion into butanoyl coa fig 5 and fig a7 explaining the presence of butyrate at high concentration in r2 this metabolic activity was also supported by morales et al 2005 who identified a high production of butyrate in milk inoculated with p lundensis the metabolic reconstruction of this species also supported the presence of pathways involved in amino acids degradation namely methionine histidine tyrosine and leucine a deeper analysis performed using eggnogg annotation showed that this pg encoded 21 proteases among which some secreted e g subtilisin these results suggested a crucial role of pseudomonas lundensis uc0042 in the degradation of proteins present in the feeding substrate this reactor also showed a higher abundance of clostridiaceae spp and in particular of clostridium spp fig 3b which could have contributed to the sugars degradation in r2 hung et al 2011 the remarkably different microbial composition exhibited by this reactor indicates a higher specialization in the hydrolytic and acidogenic activities which might have contributed to the higher process efficiency of the two stage configuration as expected no archaea were found in r2 since the ph was prohibitive for methanogenic growth 3 9 0 1 weiland 2010 fig a2b 3 2 3 two stage methanogenic reactor r3 the methanogenic reactor of the serial configuration r3 presented the highest microbial richness when compared to the other reactors fig a1c this divergence could be mainly due to the feed of r3 which was mainly composed by the vfas produced in the acidogenic reactor r2 resulting in different metabolic activities and functionalities in the two configurations among bacterial population bacteroidetes phylum 11 abundance was included and represented by only one species bacteroidetes sp uc0002 fig 3c differently from other pgs belonging to the bacteroidetes phylum in previous studies campanaro et al 2016 luo et al 2016 stolze et al 2016 the predictive functional investigation performed on bacteroidetes sp uc0002 did not classify it to the hydrolytic step of the ad food chain but assigned a role in amino acids intake and degradation as well as in fatty acids biosynthesis moreover from the kegg functional analysis was suggested an ability of bacteroidetes sp uc0002 to perform the reductive tca cycle by encoding five fundamental enzymes fdr suc icd aco pc fig 5 and fig a8 it is worth noticing the high abundances of syntrophomonas sp uc0014 and syntrophaceticus sp uc0017 in r3 fig 3c uc0014 was one of the pgs together with p lundensis uc0042 in r2 having a complete β oxidation pathway fig a4 this suggested an involvement of syntrophomonas sp uc0014 in the syntrophic oxidation of the butyrate produced in the acidogenic reactor r2 into acetate fig 5 and fig a9 considering syntrophaceticus sp uc0017 its functional analysis revealed a complete wood ljungdahl w l pathway which can be likely utilized in the oxidative direction fig 5 and fig a10 it was demonstrated that strictly related species such as s schinkii can oxidize acetate to hydrogen and or formate whose usage by hydrogenotrophic methanogens makes the reaction energetically favored manzoor et al 2015 it is interesting to note the specific presence 4 of chloroflexi spp in r3 fig 3c despite the metabolic functions of bacteria belonging to this group are still poorly characterized few studies established the potential role of chloroflexi spp in carbohydrates degradation ariesyady et al 2007 even though the archaeal abundance was comparable between the two configurations approximately 2 fig a 2a a 2c r3 had a more biodiverse population of methanogens that were assigned to three different classes fig a3 namely methanobacteria 38 methanomicrobia 34 thermoplasmata 28 they correspond to a core population of three equally abundant methanogens methanothermobacter wolfeii uc0008 methanosarcina thermophila uc0006 and methanomassiliicoccus sp uc0009 fig 4 methanomassiliicoccus species can produce methane by reducing methanol with hydrogen dridi et al 2012 but they can also utilize methylamines to perform methylotrophic methanogenesis poulsen et al 2013 methanosarcina thermophila can instead utilize acetate methanol methylamines and h2 co2 zinder et al 1985 the h2 generated from the β oxidation pathway performed by syntrophomonas sp uc0014 can be transferred to hydrogenotrophic methanogens such as methanothermobacter wolfeii uc0008 and the generalist methanosarcina thermophila uc0006 which act as h2 sinks and support the syntrophic association between species utilization of h2 by the archaea shifts the reaction equilibrium towards acetate oxidation increasing the energy gain of the bacterial species sieber et al 2010 stams and plugge 2009 the higher biodiversity in methanogenic taxa could be one of the reasons why r3 was more efficient since a wider range of metabolic intermediates can be converted to methane this could avoid the accumulation of specific compounds such acetate which concentration was found to be remarkably increased in the single stage reactor configuration r1 4 conclusions in conclusion this study allowed gaining new insights on the anaerobic digestion of dairy wastes identifying constraints about reactor configurations and highlighting the main metabolic players of the complex microbial consortia the superior performance of the two stage configuration was mainly due to the pre acidification step which allowed a better distribution of the microbial species in suitable habitat for their metabolic activities in particular bifidobacterium crudilactis uc0001 was the main lactose degrader in the acidogenic phase of ad whereas a wider set of methanogenic archaea methanothermobacter wolfeii uc0008 methanosarcina thermophila uc0006 and methanomassiliicoccus sp uc0009 was responsible for the higher methane yield reached by the serial configuration moreover it was evident that the acetate concentration exhibited by the single stage reactor was mainly due to the lack of aceticlastic methanogens and to the partial inhibition of the methanogenic hydrogen scavengers methanothermobacter wolfeii uc0008 and methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus uc0010 hampering the activity of the low abundant syntrophic acetate oxidizer species such as tepidanaerobacter acetatoxydans uc0018 the findings of this work can be further utilized for development of reactor designs aiming high rate yield methane production from dairy wastewater and serve as complementary foundation for deciphering the biogas microbiome

correlation between its concentration in the recharge effluent and the observation wells changes in the source of recharge effluent wastewater treatment technology and recharge regime were found to be the main factors affecting turnover in total nitrogen and its components during aerobic operation of the infiltration basins most organic nitrogen and ammonium will be converted to nitrate total nitrogen removal in the upper part of the aquifer was found to be 47 63 by denitrification and absorption and overall removal including the lower part of the aquifer was 49 83 to maintain the aerobic

kanarek and michail 1996 fox et al 2001 idelovitch et al 2003 lin et al 2008 lin and banin 2006 amy and drewes 2007 only a few studies have studied nitrogen balance under sat systems idelovitch et al 2003 analyzed long term sat performance the overall nitrogen removal was calculated from the difference between inflowing tww and outflow at an observation well ow the drawback with this comparison also done by icekson tal et al 2013 is that each nitrogen component behaves and moves differently in the soil and has a different retardation time on its way through the aquifer environmental or operative conditions such as flooding regime determine which nitrogen component will be dominant in the soil water in other words before analyzing nitrogen removal by sat one must identify the relevant nitrogen component the only report on the soreq infiltration basins that considered ion retention time was carried out by lin and banin 2006 in their research on phosphorus however their study has not addressed or analyzed issues regarding nitrogen quantification of nitrogen balances in large scale wastewater treatment processes employing soils such as sat systems is important in terms of both recovered water quality and potential contamination of the aquifer by nitrogen or secondary contaminations oren et al 2007 a better understanding of the nitrogen cycle can help prevent poor water quality events the soil nitrogen cycle in sat systems can be governed by physical and or biological processes depending on environmental conditions and hydraulic and nitrogen loads the main nitrogen components in tww are ammonium nh4 and organic nitrogen outlet of nitrogen from the sat system occurs through two main processes i with nitrogen containing water pumped from the aquifer and ii by denitrification the latter is the process by which nitrate no3 or nitrite no2 is reduced to nitrous oxide n2o and nitrogen gas n2 by denitrifying bacteria under anaerobic conditions when tww is applied to the infiltration basin s soil surface the concurrent environmental conditions will dictate the course of the nitrogen cycle nitrogen can decrease in the system via mobilization and movement to the aquifer or it can be immobilized through both biotic and abiotic processes balesdent and balabane 1996 ammonium is efficiently immobilized by clay minerals and organic matter om in sediments boatman and murray 1982 lau et al 1995 van raaphorst and malschaert 1996 liu et al 2002 however other studies have indicated that om adsorbed onto clay surfaces blocks ammonium exchange sites and results in decreased ammonium adsorption capacity swift 1980 hedges and keil 1995 alongi 1996 holmboe and kristensen 2002 accumulation of om is expected to occur in the top 30 cm of the infiltration basin lin et al 2008 another process of immobilization is through assimilation by plants and microorganisms when exchangeable or fixed forms of ammonium or nitrate are available to them addition of substrates with a high carbon to nitrogen ratio will bring about rapid microbial assimilation of ammonium mengel 1996 physical immobilization by ion exchange of nitrogen generally occurs for positively charge nitrogen ions i e nh4 and biological immobilization when the ions are either nh4 or no3 any immobilization physical or biological will increase the retardation time for nitrogen reaching the aquifer in this study use is made of the previous 40 years secondary data to evaluate the long term behavior of nitrogen in the sat system processes concerning the main nitrogen fractions ammonium nitrate and organic nitrogen their long term behavior in the sat system and their retardation in the vadose zone and assess threshold limits for nitrogen loads are the focus 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the sat infiltration basins are located above the costal aquifer of israel 10 km south of the city of tel aviv the infiltration basins consist of four spreading basins fig 1 surrounded by recovery wells rws and ows the depth to the groundwater table at soreq is about 20 30 m depending on topography and seasonal water level vengosh and keren 1996 the bottom of the aquifer is the saqiya layer located approximately 180 m below the soil surface the soil profile contains mainly quartz rich dune sand primarily loose or partly consolidated deposits of calcareous pleistocene sandstones and some small amounts of sandy clay lenses located throughout the soil profile issar 1968 lin et al 2008 the topsoil layer contains soil om originating from long term recharge with tww the percentage of om decreases from 0 6 to 0 11 between 0 and 0 30 m soil depth lin et al 2008 2 2 operation regime the operation of the infiltration basin includes a routine recharge regime of flooding and drying cycles the recharge cycle employed there since its establishment in 1977 consists of 1 2 days of flooding followed by 5 7 days of drainage and drying from 1977 to the end of 2015 a total of 730 million cubic meters of tww were recharged to the aquifer through the soreq recharge basins infiltration basin maintenance includes ploughing of the upper soil layer 0 30 cm every 2 weeks a set of rws and ows are supplementary to the infiltration fields rws collect the treated water mixed with groundwater at a distance of approximately 1 2 km from the centers of the recharge sites lin and banin 2006 a set of ows are located between the infiltration site and the rws ows 62 1 and 62 2 fig 2 are located inside the infiltration basin on a dike between two pools in the same position fig 1 ow 62 1 drilled to 106 m screens depths of 86 102 m ow 62 2 drilled to 67 m screens depths of 31 63 m fig 2 the aquifer is naturally divided into four horizons separated from each other by a layer of sandy clay horizon a is open to the soil surface and subject to refill from infiltration and rain other horizons receive water from those above them ow 62 2 was drilled to horizon b and ow 62 1 was drilled to horizon c this study focuses on water samples from these two wells 2 3 monitoring scheme a water quality monitoring program was initiated in 1977 but the sampling intervals were not consistent water sampling from ow 62 1 and 62 2 was carried out from 1977 to 1989 at a frequency of 8 12 times per year and from 1990 on at sampling intervals of 2 4 times per year tww is sampled at the pumping station at the end of the wwtp the sampling regime includes at least 2 samples per week water analysis was carried out in the mekorot wastewater laboratory shafdan wwtp all water sample analyses were performed by standard methods ammonium nitrate nitrite and kjeldahl nitrogen were measured as nitrogen organic nitrogen was calculated by subtracting ammonium nitrogen from the kjeldahl nitrogen total nitrogen tn was calculated as the sum of the kjeldahl nitrogen nitrite and nitrate means and standard deviations were calculated over 3 month periods 2 4 travel time evaluation flow direction in the vadose zone is assumed to be vertical however when infiltrating tww reaches or passes the capillary fringe horizontal flow components should also be considered the relationship between vertical and horizontal flow is difficult to monitor due to seasonal changes in groundwater levels and consequent changes in the hydraulic gradient in time and space icekson tal et al 2013 in addition the distribution of clay lenses and their discontinuous nature in the soil profile may locally enhance the horizontal flow component amir et al 2013 given the above water flow conditions the travel time was evaluated between the infiltration basin surface and a target ow using a cross correlation procedure chatfield 2004 between chloride concentrations at the recharge effluents re and ows specifically the objective function was set as the best fit linear cross correlation between chloride concentration in the re and the target ow 1 c x y k 1 n t 1 n k x t x y t k y k 0 1 2 n 1 r x y k c x y σ x σ y where c xy is the cross covariance t is time n is the number of observation points r xy is the cross correlation function and σ is the standard deviation the time gap that yielded the best correlation coefficient was assigned as the travel time t r between the basin surface and the target ow the delay in nitrogen compounds was quantified relative to the t r obtained for chloride specifically the ratio between the concentration of a target nitrogen compound in the re at time t and its concentration in the target ow at time t r was calculated as follows 2 r c re t c ow t t r where r is the retardation factor and c is the concentration at the ow or re at time t for conservative ions such as chloride r 1 where r 1 indicates retardation in the transport of a target nitrogen component relative to chloride 3 results and discussion 3 1 long term changes in wastewater quality during the 40 years of operation of the shafdan wwtp the water quality of the re went through changes due to six main events that are summarized in table 1 these changes can be explained mainly by i upgrading of wastewater purification facilities and ii changes in wastewater origin the former relates to the developmental progress of the wwtp from simple oxidation ponds to an activated sludge system which resulted in improved om and all nitrogen components removal changes in wastewater origin were gradual and caused a significant change in concentrations of chloride and other major ions as will be shown in the following section fig 3 3 2 turnover in chloride concentrations in the re and ows over the four decades of the wwtp s operation the chloride concentration in the tww went through three main changes fig 3 corresponding to changes in quality of the wastewater entering the wwtp table 1 from 1977 to 1987 the chloride concentration in the re was fairly constant infiltrating re displaced native groundwater which was expressed in a clear breakthrough in chloride concentration as a result in both ows the chloride concentration increased from about 30 mg l to a relatively constant value of 200 mg l from 1987 to 2004 wastewater from the entire dan region was delivered to the wwtp this water was characterized by higher salinity resulting in an additional increase of about 100 mg l in chloride concentrations of the re and both ows from 2005 to 2016 gradual incorporation of desalinized water into the urban environment was reflected in a reduction in chloride concentration which can be seen in the re and ows throughout the entire period seasonal changes between summer and winter could be observed specifically during winter months the chloride concentration was lower than in the summer mainly due to dilution with rainwater a notable delay can be observed between changes in the chloride concentration in the re and the two ows the delay can be quantified from calculation of t r values following the afore described cross correlation procedure the t r values obtained were 3 months r 2 0 76 for ow 62 2 and 18 months r 2 0 72 for ow 62 1 lin et al 2008 calculated travel times i e tr of 2 2 2 4 months to ow 62 2 and 13 8 15 months to ow 62 1 it should be noted that lin et al 2008 are the only researchers to have investigated travel time differences between the soil surface and ows other studies simply calculated the ratio of the concentration of the target solute between the re and the ows the tr value obtained by lin et al 2008 for the upper ow is similar to our calculations of one quarter of a year and the second has a gap of 3 5 months excluding the first period omitted from the cross correlation procedure the values of r were not significantly different from 1 fig 3 namely chloride can be treated as a conservative tracer in our system the chloride based calculated travel time was further used to calculate r for the reactive transport of nitrogen compounds 3 3 nitrogen behavior under the infiltration field the turnover in nitrogen compound concentration in the re and ow is presented in fig 4 variations in tn concentration relative to chloride fig 3 are notable the two main nitrogen compounds in the re are nh4 n and on with a negligible concentration of no3 n and no2 n the latter is not presented in the fig 4 because of its non detectable concentration 1 mg l the turnover in nitrogen compound concentration may have been affected by three major events table 1 i instability of the purification process at the oxidation ponds periods 1 3 1977 1990 ii replacement of the oxidation pond by activated sludge period 4 1990 1999 and iii improvement of the activated sludge process by additional aeration resulting in better nitrogen removal periods 5 and 6 1999 2016 during the entire period of operation of the wwtp no3 n and no2 n concentrations in the re were negligible 1 mg l relative to on and nh4 n the on concentration ranged from 5 to 10 mg l and was not dramatically affected by the three aforementioned major events ammonium was the main nitrogen compound to undergo changes due to variations in the purification process during the first period the ammonium concentration was less stable and fluctuated between 2 and 10 mg l except for the years 1990 1996 when it increased to a mean of 20 mg l the ammonium concentration also changed seasonally between summer and winter increasing by approximately 5 mg l in winter compared to summer most peaks of organic nitrogen and ammonium occurred simultaneously amplifying the tn load during these periods and affecting nitrogen turnover in the infiltration process tn turnover of the re may be affected by three main factors i recharge regime i e hydraulic loads and intervals ii absolute and relative concentrations of nitrogen compounds in the re and iii reactive transport in the vadose zone and aquifer under optimal conditions the recharge regime provides aerobic conditions following the flooding phase this enables relatively rapid over several hours nitrification of ammonium to nitrate and the latter is readily leached to the aquifer in fig 5 the values r 1 may indicate periods during which optimal conditions for nitrification prevailed ammonium is converted to nitrate by nitrification fig 4b and c some examples for these conditions were found in the early years from 1980 where r 1 fig 5 this increased later in 1981 when water quality was degraded tn increased above 10 mg l the same mechanism with an increase in ammonium concentration recurred in 1984 and a year later in 1985 and thereafter from 1989 to 1990 and onwards when tn is under 10 mg l conditions are aerobic supporting nitrification and the resulting r 1 however all of these periods ended with an increase in tn above 10 mg l which caused an increase in r these cases will be discussed further on there was one exception to these events in which r 1 but was not due to nitrification between the years 1994 and 1997 r in ow 62 2 was 1 but it occurred after a long period of relatively high ammonium levels in the re the mechanism suggested in this case is ion exchange of ammonium in the sediment from 1991 there was an increase in ammonium concentration in the re after a year the nitrate did not reach ow 62 2 indicating that nitrification processes did not take place in 1993 ow 62 2 started to receive ammonium there are no historical records on the infiltration regime for these years but the results implied that there was no aeration between recharge cycles this was ascribed to a period of continuous infiltration where ammonium was displaced down to the aquifer during this period ion exchange of ammonium on the sediments may have reached an equilibrium state after which the ammonium continued with the infiltrating water without retardation as indicated by r approaching one fig 5 it should be mentioned that the breakthrough of ammonium in ow 62 2 occurred after 3 5 years of high ammonium levels in the tww in the lower well ow 62 1 the breakthrough occurred after approximately 7 years it ended a year later in 1998 when ammonium in the infiltrating water declined to under 10 mg l and the sat became aerobic again nitrogen migration in the aquifer is sometimes disturbed resulting in r 1 these periods may be the consequence of two main processes i denitrification of nitrate to gaseous nitrogen and ii adsorption of ammonium to sediment or to om the first process requires an anaerobic environment and the presence of om in such an environment some or all nitrate is denitrified to gaseous nitrogen as mentioned the anaerobic environment may be the result of high hydraulic loads and or short recharge intervals preventing natural diffusion of air into the soil and promoting an anaerobic environment in the vadose zone it should be noted that not all of the vadose zone be anaerobic it is enough that only some areas are anaerobic for denitrification to occur sher et al 2012 the retardation of nitrogen will depend on the magnitude of the above mentioned processes for example in fig 4 for the last 15 years from 2001 when there is nitrification in the topsoil nitrate reaches the ow but not all nitrate reaches the aquifer i e some is lost due to denitrification the second process is ion exchange of ammonium in the vadose zone this process will start when the ammonium concentration in the re increases promoting displacement of ammonium deeper into the vadose zone the ammonium exchange is mostly taking place on clay lenses in deeper layers but also may occur on the organic fraction in the topsoil however the topsoil usually presents an aerobic environment encouraging nitrification an example of ion exchange can be seen in fig 5 for the first two decades when ammonium or tn concentration in infiltrated effluents exceeds 10 mg l there is an increase in r in both events in 1985 1988 and in 1990 1998 nitrate cannot be seen in the ow which indicates that there is no nitrification and therefore there is more substrate for denitrification the last behavior of nitrogen migration under the infiltration basins results in r 1 in terms of retardation it usually means that the ion is faster than a conservative ion such as in the case of anion exclusion in our case it means that there is addition of nitrogen compared to the re the source of excess nitrogen is the release of exchangeable ammonium from the sediment into the soil solution in the 40 years of monitoring the infiltration fields this event occurred twice the first time was in 1989 after the first breakthrough of ammonium into deeper layers which loaded the aquifer with ammonium a combination of two processes resulted in increases in tn in ow 62 2 the first was normal nitrification of ammonium to nitrate and its displacement into the aquifer the second was ion exchange of ammonium promoted by the increase in the main cations concentration fig 6 as a result of changes in water source table 1 period 2 consequently a release of exchangeable ammonium from the sediments took place both sources of nitrogen i e nitrification and release result in additional nitrogen relative to the re and thus r 1 ammonium appeared only in the upper well ow 62 2 the excess ammonium probably adsorbed between the wells and did not reach the lower well ow 62 1 the second occurrence of r 1 began in 2005 when a combination of nitrification in the upper aquifer and release of exchangeable ammonium in the lower aquifer resulted excess tn in the lower well since the source of ammonium was not the upper well it must have been from the sediment between the wells in this event ion exchange occurred due to the reduction in ammonium concentration after a long period of high concentration the long period of high ammonium concentration in the re results in high exchangeable concentration of ammonium thereafter a decrease in soluble ammonium concentration altered the ion exchange equilibrium promoting the release of exchangeable ammonium to the soil solution it should be mentioned that release of exchangeable ammonium initiated in 2002 continued to 2009 2010 in 2010 ammonium concentration decreased to zero i e a new exchange balance was achieved after 8 years 3 4 nitrogen mass balance the tn mass balance was calculated from nitrogen concentration and the corresponding hydraulic loads of the re the temporal tn mass fig 7 exhibited similar behavior to the tn concentration which may stem from variations in the tn concentration and or hydraulic loads at the beginning of the first period 1977 1981 there were many changes in the aquifer and as a result the tn concentration at the ow was influenced by the native water of the aquifer and did not represent the conditions after operating the infiltration fields for a longer time the long term behavior of the infiltration project was seen subsequently for the next two periods end of period 1 period 2 1981 1989 the tn load from the tww changed over time the overall tn removal was 50 67 table 2 summarizes the average tn load in the different periods the overall nitrogen load in the area between the soil surface and ow 6 22 averaged 221 tons per year tn removal was 1527 tons which was 57 of the incoming tn the tn removal between the shallow and deep well was only 101 tons which was another 4 of the incoming tn i e most of the nitrogen removal occurred in the upper part of the soil surface 0 67 m and the nitrogen fraction that reached ow 62 2 mostly nitrate continued to ow 62 1 in periods 3 and 4 1990 1998 a high ammonium load was observed and the average tn load increased to 3600 tons an average of 450 ton year tn removal between the soil surface and ow 6 22 was 2265 tons which was 63 of the incoming tn between the shallow and deep well another 705 tons of tn were removed 20 of the applied nitrogen the increased removal was due to adsorption of ammonium onto clay lenses as discussed in section 3 3 in periods 5 and 6 there was a reduction in nitrogen load to a yearly average of 190 tons due to more efficient removal of nitrogen from the effluents in the wwtp between the soil surface and ow 6 22 a total of 1508 ton year was removed constituting 47 of the incoming effluents between the shallow and deeper wells another 69 tons of tn was removed 2 of the influent tn the percentage of nitrogen removed between the two wells decreased because of the release of absorbed ammonium from the sediments in the long term resolution the tn mass followed the same behavior as concentration when the water volume increased in the last two decades tn concentration decreased with the result that the maximum concentration and maximum mass load were found at the same time periods 3 and 4 1990 1998 it cannot be determined from the historical data which is more important mass load or concentration total removal of tn in the upper part of the soil was 47 63 and has been relatively stable over the last 40 years when ammonium concentration increases and permeates down into deep soil the removal of tn in the short term increases due to adsorption in the deep soil later nitrogen will be released to the pore water in the aquifer between the ows another 0 20 was removed resulting in a total removal of 49 83 tn 4 conclusion the hydraulic travel time is an essential parameter for understanding nitrogen balances in soil to compare the re with that in the ow the hydraulic travel time calculated based on chloride ions was found to be 3 months to ow 62 2 and 18 months to ow 62 1 during aerobic operation of the infiltration basins most organic nitrogen and ammonium will be converted to nitrate the tn removal in the upper part of the soil was found to be 47 63 by denitrification and absorption and the overall removal including the lower part of the aquifer was 49 83 to maintain aerobic operation of the infiltration fields tn should remain below 10 mg l above this limit ammonium and organic nitrogen will displace into the aquifer in the 1990s the fields experienced 9 years of ammonium above 10 mg l it took 3 5 years for the ammonium to reach the upper ow and 7 years to the lower well after this period the ion exchange reached equilibrium state and ammonium was readily displaced adsorbed ammonium was released to the pore water by ion exchange due to i increased ionic strength in the water solution and ii a change decrease in ammonium concentration it took 8 years in the lower ow to exchange all excess adsorbed nitrogen to reach steady state conditions nitrogen loading and environmental conditions will determine the dominant nitrogen fraction to keep the infiltration basins of sat as a sustainable aerobic system it is essential to avoid overloading the system with excess nitrogen 10 mg l overload will result in changes in the deep soil profile and decreased the reclaimed water quality acknowledgements the partial financial support for this study by the jacob blaustein institutes

also done by icekson tal et al 2013 is that each nitrogen component behaves and moves differently in the soil and has a different retardation time on its way through the aquifer environmental or operative conditions such as flooding regime determine which nitrogen component will be dominant in the soil water in other words before analyzing nitrogen removal by sat one must identify the relevant nitrogen component the only report on the soreq infiltration basins that considered ion retention time was carried out by lin and banin 2006 in their research on phosphorus however their study has not addressed or analyzed issues regarding nitrogen quantification of nitrogen balances in large scale wastewater treatment processes employing soils such as sat systems is important in terms of both recovered water quality and potential contamination of the aquifer by nitrogen or secondary contaminations oren et al 2007 a better understanding of the nitrogen cycle can help prevent poor water quality events the soil nitrogen cycle in sat systems can be governed by physical and or biological processes depending on environmental conditions and hydraulic and nitrogen loads the main nitrogen components in tww are ammonium nh4 and organic nitrogen outlet of nitrogen from the sat system occurs through two main processes i with nitrogen containing water pumped from the aquifer and ii by denitrification the latter is the process by which nitrate no3 or nitrite no2 is reduced to nitrous oxide n2o and nitrogen gas n2 by denitrifying bacteria under anaerobic conditions when tww is applied to the infiltration basin s soil surface the concurrent environmental conditions will dictate the course of the nitrogen cycle nitrogen can decrease in the system via mobilization and movement to the aquifer or it can be immobilized through both biotic and abiotic processes balesdent and balabane 1996 ammonium is efficiently immobilized by clay minerals and organic matter om in sediments boatman and murray 1982 lau et al 1995 van raaphorst and malschaert 1996 liu et al 2002 however other studies have indicated that om adsorbed onto clay surfaces blocks ammonium exchange sites and results in decreased ammonium adsorption capacity swift 1980 hedges and keil 1995 alongi 1996 holmboe and kristensen 2002 accumulation of om is expected to occur in the top 30 cm of the infiltration basin lin et al 2008 another process of immobilization is through assimilation by plants and microorganisms when exchangeable or fixed forms of ammonium or nitrate are available to them addition of substrates with a high carbon to nitrogen ratio will bring about rapid microbial assimilation of ammonium mengel 1996 physical immobilization by ion exchange of nitrogen generally occurs for positively charge nitrogen ions i e nh4 and biological immobilization when the ions are either nh4 or no3 any immobilization physical or biological will increase the retardation time for nitrogen reaching the aquifer in this study use is made of the previous 40 years secondary data to evaluate the long term behavior of nitrogen in the sat system processes concerning the main nitrogen fractions ammonium nitrate and organic nitrogen their long term behavior in the sat system and their retardation in the vadose zone and assess threshold limits for nitrogen loads are the focus 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the sat infiltration basins are located above the costal aquifer of israel 10 km south of the city of tel aviv the infiltration basins consist of four spreading basins fig 1 surrounded by recovery wells rws and ows the depth to the groundwater table at soreq is about 20 30 m depending on topography and seasonal water level vengosh and keren 1996 the bottom of the aquifer is the saqiya layer located approximately 180 m below the soil surface the soil profile contains mainly quartz rich dune sand primarily loose or partly consolidated deposits of calcareous pleistocene sandstones and some small amounts of sandy clay lenses located throughout the soil profile issar 1968 lin et al 2008 the topsoil layer contains soil om originating from long term recharge with tww the percentage of om decreases from 0 6 to 0 11 between 0 and 0 30 m soil depth lin et al 2008 2 2 operation regime the operation of the infiltration basin includes a routine recharge regime of flooding and drying cycles the recharge cycle employed there since its establishment in 1977 consists of 1 2 days of flooding followed by 5 7 days of drainage and drying from 1977 to the end of 2015 a total of 730 million cubic meters of tww were recharged to the aquifer through the soreq recharge basins infiltration basin maintenance includes ploughing of the upper soil layer 0 30 cm every 2 weeks a set of rws and ows are supplementary to the infiltration fields rws collect the treated water mixed with groundwater at a distance of approximately 1 2 km from the centers of the recharge sites lin and banin 2006 a set of ows are located between the infiltration site and the rws ows 62 1 and 62 2 fig 2 are located inside the infiltration basin on a dike between two pools in the same position fig 1 ow 62 1 drilled to 106 m screens depths of 86 102 m ow 62 2 drilled to 67 m screens depths of 31 63 m fig 2 the aquifer is naturally divided into four horizons separated from each other by a layer of sandy clay horizon a is open to the soil surface and subject to refill from infiltration and rain other horizons receive water from those above them ow 62 2 was drilled to horizon b and ow 62 1 was drilled to horizon c this study focuses on water samples from these two wells 2 3 monitoring scheme a water quality monitoring program was initiated in 1977 but the sampling intervals were not consistent water sampling from ow 62 1 and 62 2 was carried out from 1977 to 1989 at a frequency of 8 12 times per year and from 1990 on at sampling intervals of 2 4 times per year tww is sampled at the pumping station at the end of the wwtp the sampling regime includes at least 2 samples per week water analysis was carried out in the mekorot wastewater laboratory shafdan wwtp all water sample analyses were performed by standard methods ammonium nitrate nitrite and kjeldahl nitrogen were measured as nitrogen organic nitrogen was calculated by subtracting ammonium nitrogen from the kjeldahl nitrogen total nitrogen tn was calculated as the sum of the kjeldahl nitrogen nitrite and nitrate means and standard deviations were calculated over 3 month periods 2 4 travel time evaluation flow direction in the vadose zone is assumed to be vertical however when infiltrating tww reaches or passes the capillary fringe horizontal flow components should also be considered the relationship between vertical and horizontal flow is difficult to monitor due to seasonal changes in groundwater levels and consequent changes in the hydraulic gradient in time and space icekson tal et al 2013 in addition the distribution of clay lenses and their discontinuous nature in the soil profile may locally enhance the horizontal flow component amir et al 2013 given the above water flow conditions the travel time was evaluated between the infiltration basin surface and a target ow using a cross correlation procedure chatfield 2004 between chloride concentrations at the recharge effluents re and ows specifically the objective function was set as the best fit linear cross correlation between chloride concentration in the re and the target ow 1 c x y k 1 n t 1 n k x t x y t k y k 0 1 2 n 1 r x y k c x y σ x σ y where c xy is the cross covariance t is time n is the number of observation points r xy is the cross correlation function and σ is the standard deviation the time gap that yielded the best correlation coefficient was assigned as the travel time t r between the basin surface and the target ow the delay in nitrogen compounds was quantified relative to the t r obtained for chloride specifically the ratio between the concentration of a target nitrogen compound in the re at time t and its concentration in the target ow at time t r was calculated as follows 2 r c re t c ow t t r where r is the retardation factor and c is the concentration at the ow or re at time t for conservative ions such as chloride r 1 where r 1 indicates retardation in the transport of a target nitrogen component relative to chloride 3 results and discussion 3 1 long term changes in wastewater quality during the 40 years of operation of the shafdan wwtp the water quality of the re went through changes due to six main events that are summarized in table 1 these changes can be explained mainly by i upgrading of wastewater purification facilities and ii changes in wastewater origin the former relates to the developmental progress of the wwtp from simple oxidation ponds to an activated sludge system which resulted in improved om and all nitrogen components removal changes in wastewater origin were gradual and caused a significant change in concentrations of chloride and other major ions as will be shown in the following section fig 3 3 2 turnover in chloride concentrations in the re and ows over the four decades of the wwtp s operation the chloride concentration in the tww went through three main changes fig 3 corresponding to changes in quality of the wastewater entering the wwtp table 1 from 1977 to 1987 the chloride concentration in the re was fairly constant infiltrating re displaced native groundwater which was expressed in a clear breakthrough in chloride concentration as a result in both ows the chloride concentration increased from about 30 mg l to a relatively constant value of 200 mg l from 1987 to 2004 wastewater from the entire dan region was delivered to the wwtp this water was characterized by higher salinity resulting in an additional increase of about 100 mg l in chloride concentrations of the re and both ows from 2005 to 2016 gradual incorporation of desalinized water into the urban environment was reflected in a reduction in chloride concentration which can be seen in the re and ows throughout the entire period seasonal changes between summer and winter could be observed specifically during winter months the chloride concentration was lower than in the summer mainly due to dilution with rainwater a notable delay can be observed between changes in the chloride concentration in the re and the two ows the delay can be quantified from calculation of t r values following the afore described cross correlation procedure the t r values obtained were 3 months r 2 0 76 for ow 62 2 and 18 months r 2 0 72 for ow 62 1 lin et al 2008 calculated travel times i e tr of 2 2 2 4 months to ow 62 2 and 13 8 15 months to ow 62 1 it should be noted that lin et al 2008 are the only researchers to have investigated travel time differences between the soil surface and ows other studies simply calculated the ratio of the concentration of the target solute between the re and the ows the tr value obtained by lin et al 2008 for the upper ow is similar to our calculations of one quarter of a year and the second has a gap of 3 5 months excluding the first period omitted from the cross correlation procedure the values of r were not significantly different from 1 fig 3 namely chloride can be treated as a conservative tracer in our system the chloride based calculated travel time was further used to calculate r for the reactive transport of nitrogen compounds 3 3 nitrogen behavior under the infiltration field the turnover in nitrogen compound concentration in the re and ow is presented in fig 4 variations in tn concentration relative to chloride fig 3 are notable the two main nitrogen compounds in the re are nh4 n and on with a negligible concentration of no3 n and no2 n the latter is not presented in the fig 4 because of its non detectable concentration 1 mg l the turnover in nitrogen compound concentration may have been affected by three major events table 1 i instability of the purification process at the oxidation ponds periods 1 3 1977 1990 ii replacement of the oxidation pond by activated sludge period 4 1990 1999 and iii improvement of the activated sludge process by additional aeration resulting in better nitrogen removal periods 5 and 6 1999 2016 during the entire period of operation of the wwtp no3 n and no2 n concentrations in the re were negligible 1 mg l relative to on and nh4 n the on concentration ranged from 5 to 10 mg l and was not dramatically affected by the three aforementioned major events ammonium was the main nitrogen compound to undergo changes due to variations in the purification process during the first period the ammonium concentration was less stable and fluctuated between 2 and 10 mg l except for the years 1990 1996 when it increased to a mean of 20 mg l the ammonium concentration also changed seasonally between summer and winter increasing by approximately 5 mg l in winter compared to summer most peaks of organic nitrogen and ammonium occurred simultaneously amplifying the tn load during these periods and affecting nitrogen turnover in the infiltration process tn turnover of the re may be affected by three main factors i recharge regime i e hydraulic loads and intervals ii absolute and relative concentrations of nitrogen compounds in the re and iii reactive transport in the vadose zone and aquifer under optimal conditions the recharge regime provides aerobic conditions following the flooding phase this enables relatively rapid over several hours nitrification of ammonium to nitrate and the latter is readily leached to the aquifer in fig 5 the values r 1 may indicate periods during which optimal conditions for nitrification prevailed ammonium is converted to nitrate by nitrification fig 4b and c some examples for these conditions were found in the early years from 1980 where r 1 fig 5 this increased later in 1981 when water quality was degraded tn increased above 10 mg l the same mechanism with an increase in ammonium concentration recurred in 1984 and a year later in 1985 and thereafter from 1989 to 1990 and onwards when tn is under 10 mg l conditions are aerobic supporting nitrification and the resulting r 1 however all of these periods ended with an increase in tn above 10 mg l which caused an increase in r these cases will be discussed further on there was one exception to these events in which r 1 but was not due to nitrification between the years 1994 and 1997 r in ow 62 2 was 1 but it occurred after a long period of relatively high ammonium levels in the re the mechanism suggested in this case is ion exchange of ammonium in the sediment from 1991 there was an increase in ammonium concentration in the re after a year the nitrate did not reach ow 62 2 indicating that nitrification processes did not take place in 1993 ow 62 2 started to receive ammonium there are no historical records on the infiltration regime for these years but the results implied that there was no aeration between recharge cycles this was ascribed to a period of continuous infiltration where ammonium was displaced down to the aquifer during this period ion exchange of ammonium on the sediments may have reached an equilibrium state after which the ammonium continued with the infiltrating water without retardation as indicated by r approaching one fig 5 it should be mentioned that the breakthrough of ammonium in ow 62 2 occurred after 3 5 years of high ammonium levels in the tww in the lower well ow 62 1 the breakthrough occurred after approximately 7 years it ended a year later in 1998 when ammonium in the infiltrating water declined to under 10 mg l and the sat became aerobic again nitrogen migration in the aquifer is sometimes disturbed resulting in r 1 these periods may be the consequence of two main processes i denitrification of nitrate to gaseous nitrogen and ii adsorption of ammonium to sediment or to om the first process requires an anaerobic environment and the presence of om in such an environment some or all nitrate is denitrified to gaseous nitrogen as mentioned the anaerobic environment may be the result of high hydraulic loads and or short recharge intervals preventing natural diffusion of air into the soil and promoting an anaerobic environment in the vadose zone it should be noted that not all of the vadose zone be anaerobic it is enough that only some areas are anaerobic for denitrification to occur sher et al 2012 the retardation of nitrogen will depend on the magnitude of the above mentioned processes for example in fig 4 for the last 15 years from 2001 when there is nitrification in the topsoil nitrate reaches the ow but not all nitrate reaches the aquifer i e some is lost due to denitrification the second process is ion exchange of ammonium in the vadose zone this process will start when the ammonium concentration in the re increases promoting displacement of ammonium deeper into the vadose zone the ammonium exchange is mostly taking place on clay lenses in deeper layers but also may occur on the organic fraction in the topsoil however the topsoil usually presents an aerobic environment encouraging nitrification an example of ion exchange can be seen in fig 5 for the first two decades when ammonium or tn concentration in infiltrated effluents exceeds 10 mg l there is an increase in r in both events in 1985 1988 and in 1990 1998 nitrate cannot be seen in the ow which indicates that there is no nitrification and therefore there is more substrate for denitrification the last behavior of nitrogen migration under the infiltration basins results in r 1 in terms of retardation it usually means that the ion is faster than a conservative ion such as in the case of anion exclusion in our case it means that there is addition of nitrogen compared to the re the source of excess nitrogen is the release of exchangeable ammonium from the sediment into the soil solution in the 40 years of monitoring the infiltration fields this event occurred twice the first time was in 1989 after the first breakthrough of ammonium into deeper layers which loaded the aquifer with ammonium a combination of two processes resulted in increases in tn in ow 62 2 the first was normal nitrification of ammonium to nitrate and its displacement into the aquifer the second was ion exchange of ammonium promoted by the increase in the main cations concentration fig 6 as a result of changes in water source table 1 period 2 consequently a release of exchangeable ammonium from the sediments took place both sources of nitrogen i e nitrification and release result in additional nitrogen relative to the re and thus r 1 ammonium appeared only in the upper well ow 62 2 the excess ammonium probably adsorbed between the wells and did not reach the lower well ow 62 1 the second occurrence of r 1 began in 2005 when a combination of nitrification in the upper aquifer and release of exchangeable ammonium in the lower aquifer resulted excess tn in the lower well since the source of ammonium was not the upper well it must have been from the sediment between the wells in this event ion exchange occurred due to the reduction in ammonium concentration after a long period of high concentration the long period of high ammonium concentration in the re results in high exchangeable concentration of ammonium thereafter a decrease in soluble ammonium concentration altered the ion exchange equilibrium promoting the release of exchangeable ammonium to the soil solution it should be mentioned that release of exchangeable ammonium initiated in 2002 continued to 2009 2010 in 2010 ammonium concentration decreased to zero i e a new exchange balance was achieved after 8 years 3 4 nitrogen mass balance the tn mass balance was calculated from nitrogen concentration and the corresponding hydraulic loads of the re the temporal tn mass fig 7 exhibited similar behavior to the tn concentration which may stem from variations in the tn concentration and or hydraulic loads at the beginning of the first period 1977 1981 there were many changes in the aquifer and as a result the tn concentration at the ow was influenced by the native water of the aquifer and did not represent the conditions after operating the infiltration fields for a longer time the long term behavior of the infiltration project was seen subsequently for the next two periods end of period 1 period 2 1981 1989 the tn load from the tww changed over time the overall tn removal was 50 67 table 2 summarizes the average tn load in the different periods the overall nitrogen load in the area between the soil surface and ow 6 22 averaged 221 tons per year tn removal was 1527 tons which was 57 of the incoming tn the tn removal between the shallow and deep well was only 101 tons which was another 4 of the incoming tn i e most of the nitrogen removal occurred in the upper part of the soil surface 0 67 m and the nitrogen fraction that reached ow 62 2 mostly nitrate continued to ow 62 1 in periods 3 and 4 1990 1998 a high ammonium load was observed and the average tn load increased to 3600 tons an average of 450 ton year tn removal between the soil surface and ow 6 22 was 2265 tons which was 63 of the incoming tn between the shallow and deep well another 705 tons of tn were removed 20 of the applied nitrogen the increased removal was due to adsorption of ammonium onto clay lenses as discussed in section 3 3 in periods 5 and 6 there was a reduction in nitrogen load to a yearly average of 190 tons due to more efficient removal of nitrogen from the effluents in the wwtp between the soil surface and ow 6 22 a total of 1508 ton year was removed constituting 47 of the incoming effluents between the shallow and deeper wells another 69 tons of tn was removed 2 of the influent tn the percentage of nitrogen removed between the two wells decreased because of the release of absorbed ammonium from the sediments in the long term resolution the tn mass followed the same behavior as concentration when the water volume increased in the last two decades tn concentration decreased with the result that the maximum concentration and maximum mass load were found at the same time periods 3 and 4 1990 1998 it cannot be determined from the historical data which is more important mass load or concentration total removal of tn in the upper part of the soil was 47 63 and has been relatively stable over the last 40 years when ammonium concentration increases and permeates down into deep soil the removal of tn in the short term increases due to adsorption in the deep soil later nitrogen will be released to the pore water in the aquifer between the ows another 0 20 was removed resulting in a total removal of 49 83 tn 4 conclusion the hydraulic travel time is an essential parameter for understanding nitrogen balances in soil to compare the re with that in the ow the hydraulic travel time calculated based on chloride ions was found to be 3 months to ow 62 2 and 18 months to ow 62 1 during aerobic operation of the infiltration basins most organic nitrogen and ammonium will be converted to nitrate the tn removal in the upper part of the soil was found to be 47 63 by denitrification and absorption and the overall removal including the lower part of the aquifer was 49 83 to maintain aerobic operation of the infiltration fields tn should remain below 10 mg l above this limit ammonium and organic nitrogen will displace into the aquifer in the 1990s the fields experienced 9 years of ammonium above 10 mg l it took 3 5 years for the ammonium to reach the upper ow and 7 years to the lower well after this period the ion exchange reached equilibrium state and ammonium was readily displaced adsorbed ammonium was released to the pore water by ion exchange due to i increased ionic strength in the water solution and ii a change decrease in ammonium concentration it took 8 years in the lower ow to exchange all excess adsorbed nitrogen to reach steady state conditions nitrogen loading and environmental conditions will determine the dominant nitrogen fraction to keep the infiltration basins of sat as a sustainable aerobic system it is essential to avoid overloading the system with excess nitrogen 10 mg l overload will result in changes in the deep soil profile and decreased the reclaimed water quality acknowledgements the partial financial support for this study by the jacob blaustein institutes

19704,the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in the modern world has raised global concerns for public health establishing relationships between antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance genes args is essential to understanding the dissemination and accumulation of args in a human impacted environment in this study arg profiles in the sediments from a bullfrog farm where penicillin and amoxicillin beta lactams and gentamicin aminoglycoside were used for prophylactic purposes were analyzed using metagenomic approaches analysis of both extracellular and intracellular dna edna and idna demonstrated that use of the above mentioned antibiotics led to complex pollution of args not only related to beta lactams and aminoglycoside but also to sulfonamides tetracyclines and macrolides most of the args in the sediments from the bullfrog farm were likely carried by plasmids a significant correlation was observed between the total abundance of arg related plasmids and that of plasmid carrying args approximately 85 of the plasmids likely present in the sediment from the bullfrog farm possessed at least 3 arg subtypes which conferred the resistance of bacterial hosts to different antibiotic categories our results suggest that antibiotics could lead to complex pollution of args unrelated to those administered due to the concurrence of args in the plasmids graphical abstract image 1 keywords antibiotic resistance genes extracellular and intracellular dna sediment aquaculture 1 introduction china is the largest producer and consumer of aquatic products in the world and accounts for approximately 70 of global aquaculture production sapkota et al 2008 considerable efforts are regularly made to increase aquaculture productivity to meet the critical needs of human nutrition kaushik 2014 however some strategies such as high stocking densities evidently ease the dissemination of epizootic pathogens between aquaculture animals and increase the incidence of infection asche et al 2009 einarsdottir et al 2000 aquatic pathogenic bacteria are transmitted between aquatic animals more easily through water than terrestrial pathogenic bacteria through air sørum 2008 antibiotics have been well accepted since they were discovered in the 1940s as the most successful therapeutic agents used in the treatment and control of infectious bacterial diseases related to both animals and humans aminov 2009 excessive and imprudent use of various antimicrobials in human and veterinary medicine agriculture and aquaculture have induced the emergence of antibiotic resistant pathogens aminov 2009 cabello 2006 consequently heavy use of antibiotics in aquaculture has instigated a growing problem for human and animal health and for the environment cabello 2006 medicated feed and rarely bath immersion are the most common types of antibiotics used to forestall bacterial infections in aquaculture sørum 2008 smith et al 2009 a significant portion of antibiotics in the feed that are not ingested by aquatic animals along with intact and metabolized antibiotics with antimicrobial properties excreted from those animals is received by the surrounding environment cabello 2006 cabello et al 2013 all of these compounds create significant selective stresses for antibiotic resistant bacteria arb as well as promote lateral gene transfer and genetic recombination of

resistance mechanisms zhang et al 2009 therefore aquaculture is considered one of the major reservoirs and sources of args in the ambient aquatic environment a previous study demonstrated that the composition and diversity of args in the sediment from aquaculture farms were significantly different from other settings e g active sludge and biofilm from sewage treatment plants ma et al 2014 however knowledge of comprehensive characteristics of args in aquaculture settings is fairly limited because the examination of an insufficient number of arg types cannot determine the whole profile of args an increasing body of studies have established that args may be selected by other contaminants with significant antimicrobial activities e g heavy metals baker austin et al 2006 pesticides anjum and krakat 2016 and disinfectants karatzas et al 2007 similarly researchers have hypothesized that args could be selected under the stresses of other categories of antibiotics that were not associated with these args this is likely because multiple args associated with different antibiotic categories reside in the same mobile genetic elements mges gaze et al 2011 zhai et al 2016 antibiotics e g ciprofloxacin can also promote the activity and or mobility of mges such as integrons and integrative conjugative elements beaber et al 2004 guerin et al 2009 and hence the frequency of arg transfer consequently unimpeded arg flows mediated by the mges among bacteria may be induced by the presence of any of antibiotics related to them aminov 2009 cabello 2006 hoa et al 2008 so that all args accumulate in the aquatic environment where antibiotics are directly introduced args potentially carried by mges are more abundant in human impacted settings than in relatively pristine environments chen et al 2016 therefore further analysis of the genomes of mges could aid in understanding the dissemination of args in an aquaculture environment the objectives of this study were to characterize a comprehensive profile of args in the sediments from an aquaculture farm where only beta lactams penicillin and amoxicillin and aminoglycoside gentamicin were administered and additionally to locate potential genetic compartments of args for elucidating the formation of multiple arg pollutants 2 meterials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling sediment samples were collected in december 2015 from an aquaculture farm located in shantou china 23 519 n 116 844 e where bullfrogs rana catesbeiana shaw were reared the bullfrog farm has been in operation since 2010 each of bullfrog ponds had an area of approximately 200 m2 and the stocking density was 150 bullfrogs per m2 approximately 30 of the water in the bullfrog ponds was exchanged daily for fresh water in the summer season from july to october penicillin and amoxicillin beta lactams and gentamicin aminoglycoside were regularly used for prophylactic purposes due to the high stocking density and air temperature in general approximately 50 g of penicillin or 20 g of amoxicillin or gentamicin was supplemented into the feed that was supplied to the bullfrogs in each pond and medicated feed was provided every 3 5 days according to the total water volume in the bullfrog ponds the final concentrations of penicillin amoxicillin or gentamicin in the water were approximately 0 33 0 13 and 0 13 μg ml respectively when they were administered during the summer these samples were taken from 4 areas within the bullfrog farm including the headrace channel inlet drainage ditch outlet and 2 bullfrog ponds n1 and n2 in the headrace channel and the drainage ditch the top 10 cm layer of sediment was collected from 3 different positions using a grab sampler and was thoroughly mixed to avoid heterogeneous differences caused by a single instance of sampling aquaculture operations in pond n1 were still being conducted when the sediments were collected whereas pond n2 had been static for 3 months following the bullfrog harvest in the bullfrog ponds sediments were taken using a grab sampler from 5 different positions which were located around and in the center of the ponds sediments from the same pond were also thoroughly mixed following collection all samples were immediately transferred into sterilized polyethylene plastic bags all samples were delivered back to the lab on ice and under dark conditions each of sediment samples was divided into two parts one portion was stored at 4 c for the subsequent extraction of edna and idna and the other portion was maintained in a freezer at 20 c for chemical analysis of the antibiotics 2 2 analysis of antibiotics seven commonly used antibiotics including sulfadiazine sulfadimidine and sulfamethoxazole sulfonamides tetracycline tetracyclines erythromycin and roxithromycin macrolides and chloramphenicol were analyzed in this study detailed pretreatment and analytical methods of antibiotics in sediment were described in our previous publications chen et al 2013a liang et al 2013 briefly the extraction and purification of antibiotics in the sediments were achieved using tandem solid phase extraction spe on sax 6 ml 200 mg cnw germany and hlb cartridges 6 ml 500 mg waters u k antibiotics were analyzed using agilent hp1100 liquid chromatography agilent palo alto ca u s along with applied biosystems api 4000 tandem mass spectrometry hplc ms ms the separation of antibiotics was performed with an agilent zorbax c18 column 2 1 150 mm 5 μm particle size following chromatographic separation the eluate was introduced into a mass spectrometer to detect antibiotics the 13c3 caffeine was used as a surrogate standard to monitor possible losses during the extraction procedure and its recovery from the sediments was approximately 65 the recovery of selected antibiotics from the samples was determined at 3 spiking concentrations 5 10 and 50 ng g with 3 replicates the limit of quantification loq was determined as the minimum detectable concentration of an analyte with a signal to noise ratio s n of 10 the recovery and loq of the target antibiotics in the sediments are shown in table s1 in the supplementary materials sm 2 3 extraction of edna and idna from sediments and high throughput illumina sequencing the methods reported in the literature were modified to extract edna and idna from the sediments of the bullfrog farm mao et al 2014 the detailed procedures were described in the sm the recovery of edna and idna from the sediments was evaluated by spiking the dna prepared from e coli and living cells of e coli the results showed that the recovery of edna and idna from the sediments was 80 2 9 4 and 102 2 4 1 respectively the extraction of edna and idna from the sediments was replicated multiple times and the dna extractant was combined to minimize possible heterogeneity in the samples and to avoid potential bias originating from a single dna extraction the purity and concentration of the dna were determined using a thermo scientific nanodrop1000 spectrophotometer the dna was delivered to annoroad gene technology beijing china in brief approximately 5 μg of dna was sheared into approximately 200 nt dna fragments then the overhangs of the dna fragments were end repaired using t4 dna polymerase klenow fragment and t4 polynucleotide kinase sequentially following the addition of an a base to the 3 end of the blunt dna fragments adapters were ligated to the ends of the dna fragments the desired fragments were purified using gel electrophoresis and were enriched and amplified using pcr the index tags were introduced into the adapter to construct dna libraries at the pcr stage the qualified dna libraries were used for sequencing by an illumina hiseq 2500 the total data output of the ten samples exceeded 30 gb the size of the dataset for each sample was approximately 3 2 gb raw sequencing data was deposited into the genbank and the accession number was presented in table s1 the sm 2 4 bioinformatic analysis the raw reads 125 bp in length with a quality score of 30 comprised more than 90 of all sequencing reads in each of the datasets and the clean rates were greater than 90 the raw reads were trimmed to discard low quality reads that contained ambiguous nucleotides or that had a quality score of less than 30 the blast programs linux release 2 2 29 were downloaded from the ncbi and entered onto the local sever to analyze our sequencing datasets against the available databases our datasets were blasted against the silva small subunit ssu database version 10 4 altschul et al 1997 mackelprang et al 2011 and 16s rrna gene like sequences with an e value threshold of 10 20 were used to characterize the bacterial community structure in the aquaculture sediments in megan version 4 70 4 with the lowest common ancestor lca algorithm in which the absolute cutoff was a blast bitscore of 50 and the relative cutoff was 10 of the top 50 hits huson et al 2007 an antibiotic resistance gene database 4287 sequences was constructed by combining the antibiotic resistance genes database ardb with the comprehensive antibiotic resistance database card and removing the repeated sequences jia et al 2017 liu and pop 2009 arg like sequences were identified when the best blastx hit had a similarity higher than 90 and an alignment length of at least 31 amino acids aa yang et al 2013 our datasets were also searched against the plasmid database that was developed according to the plasmid sequences deposited into the ncbi refseq database 7716 sequences yang et al 2013 the plasmid like sequences were determined by alignments with an identity greater than 95 over a sequence length longer than 90 nt zhang et al 2011 to determine the potential genetic location of the args in the plasmids arg like reads were drawn from sequencing datasets from all sediments and were then blasted against the plasmid database to predict their presence in the plasmids chen et al 2016 the occurrence of args in the plasmids was further confirmed by aligning the whole gene sequences of the plasmids likely identified in our samples against the arg database where the cutoff threshold was an identity greater than 80 above the query arg sequence coverage of at least 70 ma et al 2016 2 5 statistical analysis nonparametric paired sample sign tests npssts and linear regression were conducted using spss 16 0 spss inc u s the npssts were performed to explore the differences in the relative composition patterns of bacterial phyla args and plasmids among the samples differences at the level of p 0 05 between the samples were considered statistically significant with respect to linear regression the data was checked to meet the normal distribution linear correlation between plasmids and args carried by the plasmids was also performed using the absolute abundance of plasmids and plasmid carrying args in the sediment samples 3 results 3 1 bacterial community structures in sediments from the bullfrog farm bacterial 16s rrna genes were identified by aligning our datasets against the ssu database and additional bacterial community structures were analyzed using megan bacteria in the sediments collected from the aquaculture farm were assigned to 18 phyla fig s1 the sm demonstrated that relative composition of bacterial phyla was consistent between edna and idna that were extracted from the same sample in general the relative composition of the bacterial community in the sediments from the headrace channel was significantly different from those in the bullfrog ponds and the drainage ditch p 0 05 proteobacteria were more enriched in the sediments from the bullfrog ponds than in the other sediments due to aquaculture operations while the relative percentage of chlorobacteria was substantially lower 3 2 abundance and resistance types of args in sediments from the bullfrog farm arg abundance was calculated by dividing the number of args like reads by the total number of sequencing reads in the same sample metagenomic analysis of both idna and edna showed that args in the sediments collected from the bullfrog ponds and the drainage ditch were substantially more abundant than those in the sediments from the headrace channel fig 1 a aquaculture operations in pond n2 had been ceased for 3 months prior to sample collection however the total abundance of args in the sediments from pond n2 was the highest among all sampling locations 84 0 and 111 2 ppm in the idna and edna respectively followed by pond n1 the drainage ditch and the headrace channel arg abundance in the sediments from the bullfrog ponds was at least 5 times higher than that from the headrace channel 14 0 and 8 6 ppm these results indicated that antibiotic use in aquaculture operations resulted in arg pollution in aquaculture and nearby aquatic environments args were classified into different resistance types according to the antibiotic categories associated with these genes args in the sediments from the bullfrog farm were able to encode resistance to over 10 categories of antibiotics such as aminoglycosides beta lactams chloramphenicols fluoroquinolones macrolides polypeptides sulfonamides and tetracyclines no significant differences in the relative composition of args were observed between idna and edna in any sediment samples p 0 05 suggesting that args in the idna were released into the external environment after the death of antibiotic resistant bacteria multidrug resistance genes accounted for approximately 23 of the total args in the sediments from the bullfrog farm fig 1b most of the args only encoded the resistance to a single antibiotic category approximately 77 the relative percentage of sulfonamide resistance genes 15 3 in all args in the sediments from the bullfrog farm was highest among all resistance types followed by tetracyclines 13 2 aminoglycosides 12 6 macrolides 11 8 and beta lactams 8 6 3 3 diversity and resistance mechanisms of args in sediments from the bullfrog farm the subtype and sequence diversity of args in the sediment samples from the bullfrog farm are shown in fig s2 the sm subtype represents the genotype of the args according to the description in the ardb and card databases and sequence diversity indicates the number of non redundant reference sequences of args identified in our sequencing datasets the amount of subtypes and sequence diversity of args in the sediments from the headrace channel were decidedly lower than those in the sediments collected from the bullfrog ponds and the drainage ditch and this was consistently observed for both idna and edna this implied that the application of beta lactams and aminoglycosides in rearing operations considerably diversified args in the bullfrog farm in terms of subtype and sequence diversity up to 36 arg subtypes related to aminoglycoside resistance were identified in the sediments from the bullfrog farm which covered 3 different resistance mechanisms including inactivation e g aac6i aada2 ant2ia and aph6id efflux e g emry and target modification ksga fig 2 a herein aminoglycoside inactivation was predominant over other resistance mechanisms approximately 80 of the aminoglycoside resistance gene which could be performed via 3 different pathways acetylation adenylation and phosphorylation regarding beta lactam resistance genes 19 lactamase encoded subtypes that were found in the sediments from the bullfrog farm were all able to specifically cleave the beta lactam ring macrolide resistance was conferred by 11 arg subtypes via inactivation e g erea an esterase to hydrolyze macrolides or efflux e g maca only 2 arg subtypes in the sediments from the bullfrog farm were associated with sulfonamide resistance suli and sulii with a bypass mechanism in which suli abundance was approximately 5 times higher than that of sulii the resistance mechanisms related to tetracyclines were more diverse than those of the other antibiotics and 22 subtypes of tetracycline resistance genes covered all 4 resistance mechanisms fig 2b efflux and inactivation mechanisms each took up approximately half of the tetracycline resistance genes in the sediments from the bullfrog farm 3 4 occurrence and abundance of plasmids in sediments from the bullfrog farm our sequencing datasets were also searched against the plasmid database to investigate their occurrence and abundance in the sediments from the bullfrog farm the results of both idna and edna showed that the total abundance of plasmid like sequences in the sediments from the bullfrog ponds and the drainage ditch was considerably higher than that of the headrace channel fig s3 in the sm the total abundance of plasmid like sequences was approximately 15 times higher in the sediments from pond n2 than in that of the headrace channel the sequences closely related to the 20 most abundant plasmids accounted for more than 50 of the total plasmid like reads in the sediments a heat map showed that the composition patterns of plasmid like sequences in the sediments were distinct among different sampling locations in the bullfrog farm and were consistently similar between idna and edna from the same location fig 3 the abundance of sequences closely related to some of the plasmids e g nz cp014648 1 nz cp004000 1 nc 022078 1 was consistently high in the sediments from the bullfrog ponds and the drainage ditch that contained high levels of args 3 5 abundance and resistance types of potential plasmid carrying args in sediments from the bullfrog farm fig 4 a showed that mean abundance of sulfonamide resistance genes potentially in the plasmids 10 1 1 4 ppm was highest among all resistance types in the sediments from the bullfrog farm followed by tetracyclines aminoglycosides beta lactams macrolides and chloramphenicols which were considered to be the main resistance types of args likely carried by plasmids the mean abundance of other plasmid carrying args which were related to fluoroquinolones multidrug resistance genes polypeptides trimethoprim and vancomycin was less than 0 6 ppm with respect to each of the main resistance types relative percentages of plasmid carrying args out of the total args were in the range of 58 6 98 4 although multidrug resistance genes in the sediments from the bullfrog farm were the most abundant among all resistance types only approximately 6 6 of them were found in the plasmids fig 4b showed that the total abundances of plasmid carrying args in the sediments from the bullfrog ponds and the drainage ditch were much higher than that of the sediments from the headrace channel as observed for the total args plasmid carrying args were most enriched in the sediments from pond n1 42 5 ppm which were approximately 10 times more abundant that those from the headrace channel 4 3 ppm in comparison to pond n1 the cessation of rearing operations at pond n2 did not decrease the abundance of plasmid carrying args in either idna nor edna 3 6 correlations between args and plasmids in sediments from the bullfrog farm fig 5 a showed that a significant correlation was observed between the total abundance of arg related plasmids and that of plasmid carrying args in the sediments from the bullfrog farm p 0 01 complete sequences for the 20 most abundant plasmids that were closely related to the plasmids in the sediments from the bullfrog farm were obtained from the plasmid database and were further aligned against the arg database the results showed that 13 of these plasmids carried a large number of arg subtypes for example 39 arg subtypes including aada2 ant2ia sul1 cmle3 bl2b tem etc were found on the plasmid nz cp004000 1 which could have encoded the resistance to aminoglycosides sulfonamides chloramphenicols and beta lactams respectively fig 5b showed that most of plasmids likely identified in the sediments from the bullfrog farm possessed more than 3 different arg subtypes approximately 85 and args carried by these plasmids accounted for approximately 78 of the total plasmid carrying args 4 discussion aquaculture has been considered one of the main pollution sources for args in the aquatic environment capkin et al 2015 zhang et al 2009 in the majority of previous studies pcr based approaches were typically used to measure the levels of several or dozens of args that were far below the number of currently well recognized args xiong et al 2015 comprehensive profiles of args in the aquaculture environment have not been well characterized a growing body of studies has demonstrated that high throughput sequencing based metagenomic methods are robust for exploring the abundance and diversity of args in various environmental settings e g the tibetan environment chen et al 2016 the pearl river estuary chen et al 2013b and wastewater treatment plants yang et al 2013 generally the total dna has been extracted from environmental samples for metagenomic sequencing and analysis in the present study idna and edna were extracted separately from the sediments and no significant difference in the relative composition of args was observed between them this result demonstrated that edna degradation in the environment did not significantly impair metagenomic profiles of args when the total dna extracted from the samples was used at least in the case of the present work metagenomic profiling of args in a previous study demonstrated that more than 20 resistance types of args were identified in the sediments of a freshwater fishpond and a marine fish farm with rifampin resistance genes being dominant 26 9 38 6 ma et al 2014 in contrast a distinct composition pattern of args according to resistance types was observed in our case and the relative percentage of multidrug resistance genes was higher than that of other resistance types this was probably due to the differences in antibiotic use and or antibiotic resistance of the local bacterial community as well as to the microbial population and pollutants such as heavy metals and pharmaceutical residues in the incoming water to the aquaculture farm analysis of the human gut microbiome demonstrated that the initial composition of the microbial community determined antibiotic impacts specific to individual participants raymond et al 2016 the arg subtypes present in the sediments from the bullfrog farm represented the major resistance mechanisms of antibiotics including efflux pumps target modification target bypass and antibiotic inactivation zhang et al 2009 as the most common mechanism to extrude intracellular toxins out of cells efflux pumps are crucial for microbes to fight against both heavy metal and organic contaminants adebusuyi and foght 2011 chen et al 2017 ryan et al 2001 transport proteins related to efflux pumps often have a high degree of substrate promiscuity and can thus serve as the transporters of multiple contaminants lomovskaya et al 2007 wright 2007 efflux pumps have been observed as the principal resistance mechanism to antibiotics in some cases e g the pre and scs sediments and pahs contaminated soils chen et al 2013b 2017 in the present study most of the args in the sediments from the bullfrog farm achieved resistance specific to a single antibiotic category mainly via antibiotic inactivation various inactivation enzymes expressed intracellularly by bacteria could have transformed antibiotics into metabolites with fewer antimicrobial activities this suggested that direct inactivation mediated by intracellular enzymes could be considered one of the most effective ways for microbes to react to antibiotics especially in typical sources of arg pollution and in highly impacted environments chen et al 2013b one or more antibiotics belonging to a single antibiotic category have often been used for prophylactic purposes in animal husbandry and aquaculture in our case penicillin and amoxicillin beta lactams and gentamicin aminoglycosides were supplemented into the feed during the summer season since higher temperatures increased the incidence and risk of bacterial disease this study demonstrated that the use of beta lactams and aminoglycosides not only resulted in the enrichment of args specific to these two antibiotic types in an aquaculture environment but also substantially elevated the abundance of args related to other antibiotic categories such as sulfonamides tetracyclines and macrolides analysis of antibiotics present in the sediments proved that these antibiotics were not applied in the bullfrog farm metagenomic profiling of args in sediments from the headrace channel as the controls determined that args not related to supplemented antibiotics may have been naturally present in the surrounding aquatic environment and their occurrence may have not directly correlated with the stresses posed by the presence of low levels of the antibiotics that were not applied to the ponds additionally our results implied that a single antibiotic could have co selected multiple args associated with a substantial variety of antibiotics particularly when high concentrations of antibiotics were directly introduced beyond the co selection the transfer of arg carried mges could also have been promoted by antibiotics beaber et al 2004 guerin et al 2009 even by those not linked to resistance genes on the mges scornec et al 2017 this implied that specific antibiotics could have dramatically enhanced the dissemination of unexpected and unrelated args with a clear risk of reducing the prophylactic and treatment potential of antibiotics in aquaculture significant relationships between args and antibiotics e g sul genes and sulfonamides chen et al 2015 luo et al 2010 have been observed frequently in the ambient aquatic environment however such relationships have mostly indicated that antibiotic contaminants and args were discharged from identical sources of pollution chen et al 2013a research has not established whether antibiotic contaminants far below sub inhibitory concentrations could exert significant selective stresses on the arb and args in the ambient environment luo et al 2011 zhang et al 2013 for example the amoxicillin concentration in seawater from victoria harbour in hong kong was below the limit of quantification 5 0 ng l xu et al 2007 but minimum inhibitory concentrations mic of amoxicillin to some pathogens e g v anguillarum and p damsel were as high as 40 and 80 ng ml respectively mazzolini et al 1997 we estimated that amoxicillin concentration in the water of bullfrog ponds was approximately 130 ng ml when it was administered as a result amoxicillin resistant bacteria were able to increase more than other susceptible species under significant selective pressure in the bullfrog ponds furthermore arg pollution was difficult to ameliorate or eliminate once it was formed in comparison to the active bullfrog ponds arg abundance was not obviously diminished in the sediments from pond n2 where rearing operations had ceased for 3 months research has also reported that tetracycline resistance genes persisted at aquaculture farms in the absence of selective stress tamminen et al 2011 args have been so recalcitrant to elimination from the aquatic environment due to the proliferation of arb and considerable stability of edna in sediment mao et al 2014 zhu 2006 microbes have been able to horizontally acquire args via transformation or conjugation under antibiotic stresses resulting in arg accumulation in environments polluted with high concentrations of antibiotics capkin et al 2017 cottell et al 2014 turner et al 2014 such lateral transfers of args needed to employ plasmids as the shuttling carriers between bacterial hosts wang et al 2015 the present study demonstrated that the plasmids likely present in the sediments from the bullfrog farm carried a considerable amount of arg subtypes related to different antibiotic categories furthermore sequence abundances that were closely related to arg carried plasmids e g nz cp014648 1 nz cp004000 1 nc 022078 1 were consistently higher in the sediments from the bullfrog ponds and the drainage ditch than those from the headrace channel significant relationships between plasmids and args were also often observed in various environmental settings chen et al 2013b ma et al 2014 a significant correlation between the total abundance of arg related plasmids and that of plasmid carrying args suggested that plasmids could have played important roles in the dissemination of args in the aquaculture environment determining the main chemical stresses responsible for arg pollution in the natural environment was difficult resistance genes associated with different types of contaminants may have concomitantly resided in the chromosomes and or plasmids of microbes li et al 2017 heavy metal contaminants were frequently linked to arg pollution because the concurrence of metal and antibiotic resistant genes in the plasmids facilitated the dissemination of args under the elevated pressure exerted by heavy metals li et al 2015 zhai et al 2016 args had also greatly accumulated in the pahs polluted soils likely due to args being present in the chromosomes of pah tolerant microbes chen et al 2017 all of these studies determined that chemical incentives for arg pollution in various environments were diverse and complicated in this study the use of beta lactams and aminoglycosides in the bullfrog farm could have also enriched args related to other antibiotics similarly we hypothesized that args conferring resistance to different antibiotic categories were carried concurrently by one plasmid or bacterial host most of the plasmids likely identified in the sediments from the bullfrog farm carried multiple arg subtypes consequently the stress exerted by any of the antibiotics could have resulted in simultaneous enrichment of all plasmid carrying args in the environment where antibiotics were directly applied under the local selective conditions plasmids contributed not only to the adaptation of individual prokaryotic species but also to that of the prokaryotic community as a whole sentchilo et al 2013 in contrast the abundance of both arg related plasmids and args potentially carried by the plasmids was lower in the tibetan and pahs contaminated environments chen et al 2016 2017 therefore all findings determined that the concurrence of args associated with different antibiotics in the plasmids may have been responsible for the complex pollution of args related to different antibiotic categories under the stress of an individual antibiotic administered to the aquaculture farm 5 conclusion to summarize the use of beta lactams and aminoglycosides in bullfrog farms resulted in the enrichment of multiple args a large portion of args was associated with antibiotics not applied during the aquaculture operations this suggested that arg pollution was not solely caused by the counterparts of antibiotics linked to resistance genes the args related to different antibiotic categories may have recombined into one single plasmid hence facilitating the dissemination of args under the stresses of antibiotics therefore knowledge regarding the abundance and diversity of plasmid carrying args is critical to understanding the formation of arg pollution as well as to developing effective methods

19704,the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in the modern world has raised global concerns for public health establishing relationships between antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance genes args is essential to understanding the dissemination and accumulation of args in a human impacted environment in this study arg profiles in the sediments from a bullfrog farm where penicillin and amoxicillin beta lactams and gentamicin aminoglycoside were used for prophylactic purposes were analyzed using metagenomic approaches analysis of both extracellular and intracellular dna edna and idna demonstrated that use of the above mentioned antibiotics led to complex pollution of args not only related to beta lactams and aminoglycoside but also to sulfonamides tetracyclines and macrolides most of the args in the sediments from the bullfrog farm were likely carried by plasmids a significant correlation was observed between the total abundance of arg related plasmids and that of plasmid carrying args approximately 85 of the plasmids likely present in the sediment from the bullfrog farm possessed at least 3 arg subtypes which conferred the resistance of bacterial hosts to different antibiotic categories our results suggest that antibiotics could lead to complex pollution of args unrelated to those administered due to the concurrence of args in the plasmids graphical abstract image 1 keywords antibiotic resistance genes extracellular and intracellular dna sediment aquaculture 1 introduction china is the largest producer and consumer of aquatic products in the world and accounts for approximately 70 of global aquaculture production sapkota et al 2008 considerable efforts are regularly made to increase aquaculture productivity to meet the critical needs of human nutrition kaushik 2014 however some strategies such as high stocking densities evidently ease the dissemination of epizootic pathogens between aquaculture animals and increase the incidence of infection asche et al 2009 einarsdottir et al 2000 aquatic pathogenic bacteria are transmitted between aquatic animals more easily through water than terrestrial pathogenic bacteria through air sørum 2008 antibiotics have been well accepted since they were discovered in the 1940s as the most successful therapeutic agents used in the treatment and control of infectious bacterial diseases related to both animals and humans aminov 2009 excessive and imprudent use of various antimicrobials in human and veterinary medicine agriculture and aquaculture have induced the emergence of antibiotic resistant pathogens aminov 2009 cabello 2006 consequently heavy use of antibiotics in aquaculture has instigated a growing problem for human and animal health and for the environment cabello 2006 medicated feed and rarely bath immersion are the most common types of antibiotics used to forestall bacterial infections in aquaculture sørum 2008 smith et al 2009 a significant portion of antibiotics in the feed that are not ingested by aquatic animals along with intact and metabolized antibiotics with antimicrobial properties excreted from those animals is received by the surrounding environment cabello 2006 cabello et al 2013 all of these compounds create significant selective stresses for antibiotic resistant bacteria arb as well as promote lateral gene transfer and genetic recombination of args shah et al 2014 a substantial variety of args associated with different antibiotic categories e g tetracyclines teta tetb tetm and teto fluoroquinolones qnrb and qnrd beta lactams bla tem 21 bla ctx m 14 and bla shv 27 are highly enriched in aquaculture environments boran et al 2013 gao et al 2012 jiang et al 2012 petersen and dalsgaard 2003 verner jeffreys et al 2009 and represent various resistance mechanisms zhang et al 2009 therefore aquaculture is considered one of the major reservoirs and sources of args in the ambient aquatic environment a previous study demonstrated that the composition and diversity of args in the sediment from aquaculture farms were significantly different from other settings e g active sludge and biofilm from sewage treatment plants ma et al 2014 however knowledge of comprehensive characteristics of args in aquaculture settings is fairly limited because the examination of an insufficient number of arg types cannot determine the whole profile of args an increasing body of studies have established that args may be selected by other contaminants with significant antimicrobial activities e g heavy metals baker austin et al 2006 pesticides anjum and krakat 2016 and disinfectants karatzas et al 2007 similarly researchers have hypothesized that args could be selected under the stresses of other categories of antibiotics that were not associated with these args this is likely because multiple args associated with different antibiotic categories reside in the same mobile genetic elements mges gaze et al 2011 zhai et al 2016 antibiotics e g ciprofloxacin can also promote the activity and or mobility of mges such as integrons and integrative conjugative elements beaber et al 2004 guerin et al 2009 and hence the frequency of arg transfer consequently unimpeded arg flows mediated by the mges among bacteria may be induced by the presence of any of antibiotics related to them aminov 2009 cabello 2006 hoa et al 2008 so that all args accumulate in the aquatic environment where antibiotics are directly introduced args potentially carried by mges are more abundant in human impacted settings than in relatively pristine environments chen et al 2016 therefore further analysis of the genomes of mges could aid in understanding the dissemination of args in an aquaculture environment the objectives of this study were to characterize a comprehensive profile of args in the sediments from an aquaculture farm where only beta lactams penicillin and amoxicillin and aminoglycoside gentamicin were administered and additionally to locate potential genetic compartments of args for elucidating the formation of multiple arg pollutants 2 meterials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling sediment samples were collected in december 2015 from an aquaculture farm located in shantou china 23 519 n 116 844 e where bullfrogs rana catesbeiana shaw were reared the bullfrog farm has been in operation since 2010 each of bullfrog ponds had an area of approximately 200 m2 and the stocking density was 150 bullfrogs per m2 approximately 30 of the water in the bullfrog ponds was exchanged daily for fresh water in the summer season from july to october penicillin and amoxicillin beta lactams and gentamicin aminoglycoside were regularly used for prophylactic purposes due to the high stocking density and air temperature in general approximately 50 g of penicillin or 20 g of amoxicillin or gentamicin was supplemented into the feed that was supplied to the bullfrogs in each pond and medicated feed was provided every 3 5 days according to the total water volume in the bullfrog ponds the final concentrations of penicillin amoxicillin or gentamicin in the water were approximately 0 33 0 13 and 0 13 μg ml respectively when they were administered during the summer these samples were taken from 4 areas within the bullfrog farm including the headrace channel inlet drainage ditch outlet and 2 bullfrog ponds n1 and n2 in the headrace channel and the drainage ditch the top 10 cm layer of sediment was collected from 3 different positions using a grab sampler and was thoroughly mixed to avoid heterogeneous differences caused by a single instance of sampling aquaculture operations in pond n1 were still being conducted when the sediments were collected whereas pond n2 had been static for 3 months following the bullfrog harvest in the bullfrog ponds sediments were taken using a grab sampler from 5 different positions which were located around and in the center of the ponds sediments from the same pond were also thoroughly mixed following collection all samples were immediately transferred into sterilized polyethylene plastic bags all samples were delivered back to the lab on ice and under dark conditions each of sediment samples was divided into two parts one portion was stored at 4 c for the subsequent extraction of edna and idna and the other portion was maintained in a freezer at 20 c for chemical analysis of the antibiotics 2 2 analysis of antibiotics seven commonly used antibiotics including sulfadiazine sulfadimidine and sulfamethoxazole sulfonamides tetracycline tetracyclines erythromycin and roxithromycin macrolides and chloramphenicol were analyzed in this study detailed pretreatment and analytical methods of antibiotics in sediment were described in our previous publications chen et al 2013a liang et al 2013 briefly the extraction and purification of antibiotics in the sediments were achieved using tandem solid phase extraction spe on sax 6 ml 200 mg cnw germany and hlb cartridges 6 ml 500 mg waters u k antibiotics were analyzed using agilent hp1100 liquid chromatography agilent palo alto ca u s along with applied biosystems api 4000 tandem mass spectrometry hplc ms ms the separation of antibiotics was performed with an agilent zorbax c18 column 2 1 150 mm 5 μm particle size following chromatographic separation the eluate was introduced into a mass spectrometer to detect antibiotics the 13c3 caffeine was used as a surrogate standard to monitor possible losses during the extraction procedure and its recovery from the sediments was approximately 65 the recovery of selected antibiotics from the samples was determined at 3 spiking concentrations 5 10 and 50 ng g with 3 replicates the limit of quantification loq was determined as the minimum detectable concentration of an analyte with a signal to noise ratio s n of 10 the recovery and loq of the target antibiotics in the sediments are shown in table s1 in the supplementary materials sm 2 3 extraction of edna and idna from sediments and high throughput illumina sequencing the methods reported in the literature were modified to extract edna and idna from the sediments of the bullfrog farm mao et al 2014 the detailed procedures were described in the sm the recovery of edna and idna from the sediments was evaluated by spiking the dna prepared from e coli and living cells of e coli the results showed that the recovery of edna and idna from the sediments was 80 2 9 4 and 102 2 4 1 respectively the extraction of edna and idna from the sediments was replicated multiple times and the dna extractant was combined to minimize possible heterogeneity in the samples and to avoid potential bias originating from a single dna extraction the purity and concentration of the dna were determined using a thermo scientific nanodrop1000 spectrophotometer the dna was delivered to annoroad gene technology beijing china in brief approximately 5 μg of dna was sheared into approximately 200 nt dna fragments then the overhangs of the dna fragments were end repaired using t4 dna polymerase klenow fragment and t4 polynucleotide kinase sequentially following the addition of an a base to the 3 end of the blunt dna fragments adapters were ligated to the ends of the dna fragments the desired fragments were purified using gel electrophoresis and were enriched and amplified using pcr the index tags were introduced into the adapter to construct dna libraries at the pcr stage the qualified dna libraries were used for sequencing by an illumina hiseq 2500 the total data output of the ten samples exceeded 30 gb the size of the dataset for each sample was approximately 3 2 gb raw sequencing data was deposited into the genbank and the accession number was presented in table s1 the sm 2 4 bioinformatic analysis the raw reads 125 bp in length with a quality score of 30 comprised more than 90 of all sequencing reads in each of the datasets and the clean rates were greater than 90 the raw reads were trimmed to discard low quality reads that contained ambiguous nucleotides or that had a quality score of less than 30 the blast programs linux release 2 2 29 were downloaded from the ncbi and entered onto the local sever to analyze our sequencing datasets against the available databases our datasets were blasted against the silva small subunit ssu database version 10 4 altschul et al 1997 mackelprang et al 2011 and 16s rrna gene like sequences with an e value threshold of 10 20 were used to characterize the bacterial community structure in the aquaculture sediments in megan version 4 70 4 with the lowest common ancestor lca algorithm in which the absolute cutoff was a blast bitscore of 50 and the relative cutoff was 10 of the top 50 hits huson et al 2007 an antibiotic resistance gene database 4287 sequences was constructed by combining the antibiotic resistance genes database ardb with the comprehensive antibiotic resistance database card and removing the repeated sequences jia et al 2017 liu and pop 2009 arg like sequences were identified when the best blastx hit had a similarity higher than 90 and an alignment length of at least 31 amino acids aa yang et al 2013 our datasets were also searched against the plasmid database that was developed according to the plasmid sequences deposited into the ncbi refseq database 7716 sequences yang et al 2013 the plasmid like sequences were determined by alignments with an identity greater than 95 over a sequence length longer than 90 nt zhang et al 2011 to determine the potential genetic location of the args in the plasmids arg like reads were drawn from sequencing datasets from all sediments and were then blasted against the plasmid database to predict their presence in the plasmids chen et al 2016 the occurrence of args in the plasmids was further confirmed by aligning the whole gene sequences of the plasmids likely identified in our samples against the arg database where the cutoff threshold was an identity greater than 80 above the query arg sequence coverage of at least 70 ma et al 2016 2 5 statistical analysis nonparametric paired sample sign tests npssts and linear regression were conducted using spss 16 0 spss inc u s the npssts were performed to explore the differences in the relative composition patterns of bacterial phyla args and plasmids among the samples differences at the level of p 0 05 between the samples were considered statistically significant with respect to linear regression the data was checked to meet the normal distribution linear correlation between plasmids and args carried by the plasmids was also performed using the absolute abundance of plasmids and plasmid carrying args in the sediment samples 3 results 3 1 bacterial community structures in sediments from the bullfrog farm bacterial 16s rrna genes were identified by aligning our datasets against the ssu database and additional bacterial community structures were analyzed using megan bacteria in the sediments collected from the aquaculture farm were assigned to 18 phyla fig s1 the sm demonstrated that relative composition of bacterial phyla was consistent between edna and idna that were extracted from the same sample in general the relative composition of the bacterial community in the sediments from the headrace channel was significantly different from those in the bullfrog ponds and the drainage ditch p 0 05 proteobacteria were more enriched in the sediments from the bullfrog ponds than in the other sediments due to aquaculture operations while the relative percentage of chlorobacteria was substantially lower 3 2 abundance and resistance types of args in sediments from the bullfrog farm arg abundance was calculated by dividing the number of args like reads by the total number of sequencing reads in the same sample metagenomic analysis of both idna and edna showed that args in the sediments collected from the bullfrog ponds and the drainage ditch were substantially more abundant than those in the sediments from the headrace channel fig 1 a aquaculture operations in pond n2 had been ceased for 3 months prior to sample collection however the total abundance of args in the sediments from pond n2 was the highest among all sampling locations 84 0 and 111 2 ppm in the idna and edna respectively followed by pond n1 the drainage ditch and the headrace channel arg abundance in the sediments from the bullfrog ponds was at least 5 times higher than that from the headrace channel 14 0 and 8 6 ppm these results indicated that antibiotic use in aquaculture operations resulted in arg pollution in aquaculture and nearby aquatic environments args were classified into different resistance types according to the antibiotic categories associated with these genes args in the sediments from the bullfrog farm were able to encode resistance to over 10 categories of antibiotics such as aminoglycosides beta lactams chloramphenicols fluoroquinolones macrolides polypeptides sulfonamides and tetracyclines no significant differences in the relative composition of args were observed between idna and edna in any sediment samples p 0 05 suggesting that args in the idna were released into the external environment after the death of antibiotic resistant bacteria multidrug resistance genes accounted for approximately 23 of the total args in the sediments from the bullfrog farm fig 1b most of the args only encoded the resistance to a single antibiotic category approximately 77 the relative percentage of sulfonamide resistance genes 15 3 in all args in the sediments from the bullfrog farm was highest among all resistance types followed by tetracyclines 13 2 aminoglycosides 12 6 macrolides 11 8 and beta lactams 8 6 3 3 diversity and resistance mechanisms of args in sediments from the bullfrog farm the subtype and sequence diversity of args in the sediment samples from the bullfrog farm are shown in fig s2 the sm subtype represents the genotype of the args according to the description in the ardb and card databases and sequence diversity indicates the number of non redundant reference sequences of args identified in our sequencing datasets the amount of subtypes and sequence diversity of args in the sediments from the headrace channel were decidedly lower than those in the sediments collected from the bullfrog ponds and the drainage ditch and this was consistently observed for both idna and edna this implied that the application of beta lactams and aminoglycosides in rearing operations considerably diversified args in the bullfrog farm in terms of subtype and sequence diversity up to 36 arg subtypes related to aminoglycoside resistance were identified in the sediments from the bullfrog farm which covered 3 different resistance mechanisms including inactivation e g aac6i aada2 ant2ia and aph6id efflux e g emry and target modification ksga fig 2 a herein aminoglycoside inactivation was predominant over other resistance mechanisms approximately 80 of the aminoglycoside resistance gene which could be performed via 3 different pathways acetylation adenylation and phosphorylation regarding beta lactam resistance genes 19 lactamase encoded subtypes that were found in the sediments from the bullfrog farm were all able to specifically cleave the beta lactam ring macrolide resistance was conferred by 11 arg subtypes via inactivation e g erea an esterase to hydrolyze macrolides or efflux e g maca only 2 arg subtypes in the sediments from the bullfrog farm were associated with sulfonamide resistance suli and sulii with a bypass mechanism in which suli abundance was approximately 5 times higher than that of sulii the resistance mechanisms related to tetracyclines were more diverse than those of the other antibiotics and 22 subtypes of tetracycline resistance genes covered all 4 resistance mechanisms fig 2b efflux and inactivation mechanisms each took up approximately half of the tetracycline resistance genes in the sediments from the bullfrog farm 3 4 occurrence and abundance of plasmids in sediments from the bullfrog farm our sequencing datasets were also searched against the plasmid database to investigate their occurrence and abundance in the sediments from the bullfrog farm the results of both idna and edna showed that the total abundance of plasmid like sequences in the sediments from the bullfrog ponds and the drainage ditch was considerably higher than that of the headrace channel fig s3 in the sm the total abundance of plasmid like sequences was approximately 15 times higher in the sediments from pond n2 than in that of the headrace channel the sequences closely related to the 20 most abundant plasmids accounted for more than 50 of the total plasmid like reads in the sediments a heat map showed that the composition patterns of plasmid like sequences in the sediments were distinct among different sampling locations in the bullfrog farm and were consistently similar between idna and edna from the same location fig 3 the abundance of sequences closely related to some of the plasmids e g nz cp014648 1 nz cp004000 1 nc 022078 1 was consistently high in the sediments from the bullfrog ponds and the drainage ditch that contained high levels of args 3 5 abundance and resistance types of potential plasmid carrying args in sediments from the bullfrog farm fig 4 a showed that mean abundance of sulfonamide resistance genes potentially in the plasmids 10 1 1 4 ppm was highest among all resistance types in the sediments from the bullfrog farm followed by tetracyclines aminoglycosides beta lactams macrolides and chloramphenicols which were considered to be the main resistance types of args likely carried by plasmids the mean abundance of other plasmid carrying args which were related to fluoroquinolones multidrug resistance genes polypeptides trimethoprim and vancomycin was less than 0 6 ppm with respect to each of the main resistance types relative percentages of plasmid carrying args out of the total args were in the range of 58 6 98 4 although multidrug resistance genes in the sediments from the bullfrog farm were the most abundant among all resistance types only approximately 6 6 of them were found in the plasmids fig 4b showed that the total abundances of plasmid carrying args in the sediments from the bullfrog ponds and the drainage ditch were much higher than that of the sediments from the headrace channel as observed for the total args plasmid carrying args were most enriched in the sediments from pond n1 42 5 ppm which were approximately 10 times more abundant that those from the headrace channel 4 3 ppm in comparison to pond n1 the cessation of rearing operations at pond n2 did not decrease the abundance of plasmid carrying args in either idna nor edna 3 6 correlations between args and plasmids in sediments from the bullfrog farm fig 5 a showed that a significant correlation was observed between the total abundance of arg related plasmids and that of plasmid carrying args in the sediments from the bullfrog farm p 0 01 complete sequences for the 20 most abundant plasmids that were closely related to the plasmids in the sediments from the bullfrog farm were obtained from the plasmid database and were further aligned against the arg database the results showed that 13 of these plasmids carried a large number of arg subtypes for example 39 arg subtypes including aada2 ant2ia sul1 cmle3 bl2b tem etc were found on the plasmid nz cp004000 1 which could have encoded the resistance to aminoglycosides sulfonamides chloramphenicols and beta lactams respectively fig 5b showed that most of plasmids likely identified in the sediments from the bullfrog farm possessed more than 3 different arg subtypes approximately 85 and args carried by these plasmids accounted for approximately 78 of the total plasmid carrying args 4 discussion aquaculture has been considered one of the main pollution sources for args in the aquatic environment capkin et al 2015 zhang et al 2009 in the majority of previous studies pcr based approaches were typically used to measure the levels of several or dozens of args that were far below the number of currently well recognized args xiong et al 2015 comprehensive profiles of args in the aquaculture environment have not been well characterized a growing body of studies has demonstrated that high throughput sequencing based metagenomic methods are robust for exploring the abundance and diversity of args in various environmental settings e g the tibetan environment chen et al 2016 the pearl river estuary chen et al 2013b and wastewater treatment plants yang et al 2013 generally the total dna has been extracted from environmental samples for metagenomic sequencing and analysis in the present study idna and edna were extracted separately from the sediments and no significant difference in the relative composition of args was observed between them this result demonstrated that edna degradation in the environment did not significantly impair metagenomic profiles of args when the total dna extracted from the samples was used at least in the case of the present work metagenomic profiling of args in a previous study demonstrated that more than 20 resistance types of args were identified in the sediments of a freshwater fishpond and a marine fish farm with rifampin resistance genes being dominant 26 9 38 6 ma et al 2014 in contrast a distinct composition pattern of args according to resistance types was observed in our case and the relative percentage of multidrug resistance genes was higher than that of other resistance types this was probably due to the differences in antibiotic use and or antibiotic resistance of the local bacterial community as well as to the microbial population and pollutants such as heavy metals and pharmaceutical residues in the incoming water to the aquaculture farm analysis of the human gut microbiome demonstrated that the initial composition of the microbial community determined antibiotic impacts specific to individual participants raymond et al 2016 the arg subtypes present in the sediments from the bullfrog farm represented the major resistance mechanisms of antibiotics including efflux pumps target modification target bypass and antibiotic inactivation zhang et al 2009 as the most common mechanism to extrude intracellular toxins out of cells efflux pumps are crucial for microbes to fight against both heavy metal and organic contaminants adebusuyi and foght 2011 chen et al 2017 ryan et al 2001 transport proteins related to efflux pumps often have a high degree of substrate promiscuity and can thus serve as the transporters of multiple contaminants lomovskaya et al 2007 wright 2007 efflux pumps have been observed as the principal resistance mechanism to antibiotics in some cases e g the pre and scs sediments and pahs contaminated soils chen et al 2013b 2017 in the present study most of the args in the sediments from the bullfrog farm achieved resistance specific to a single antibiotic category mainly via antibiotic inactivation various inactivation enzymes expressed intracellularly by bacteria could have transformed antibiotics into metabolites with fewer antimicrobial activities this suggested that direct inactivation mediated by intracellular enzymes could be considered one of the most effective ways for microbes to react to antibiotics especially in typical sources of arg pollution and in highly impacted environments chen et al 2013b one or more antibiotics belonging to a single antibiotic category have often been used for prophylactic purposes in animal husbandry and aquaculture in our case penicillin and amoxicillin beta lactams and gentamicin aminoglycosides were supplemented into the feed during the summer season since higher temperatures increased the incidence and risk of bacterial disease this study demonstrated that the use of beta lactams and aminoglycosides not only resulted in the enrichment of args specific to these two antibiotic types in an aquaculture environment but also substantially elevated the abundance of args related to other antibiotic categories such as sulfonamides tetracyclines and macrolides analysis of antibiotics present in the sediments proved that these antibiotics were not applied in the bullfrog farm metagenomic profiling of args in sediments from the headrace channel as the controls determined that args not related to supplemented antibiotics may have been naturally present in the surrounding aquatic environment and their occurrence may have not directly correlated with the stresses posed by the presence of low levels of the antibiotics that were not applied to the ponds additionally our results implied that a single antibiotic could have co selected multiple args associated with a substantial variety of antibiotics particularly when high concentrations of antibiotics were directly introduced beyond the co selection the transfer of arg carried mges could also have been promoted by antibiotics beaber et al 2004 guerin et al 2009 even by those not linked to resistance genes on the mges scornec et al 2017 this implied that specific antibiotics could have dramatically enhanced the dissemination of unexpected and unrelated args with a clear risk of reducing the prophylactic and treatment potential of antibiotics in aquaculture significant relationships between args and antibiotics e g sul genes and sulfonamides chen et al 2015 luo et al 2010 have been observed frequently in the ambient aquatic environment however such relationships have mostly indicated that antibiotic contaminants and args were discharged from identical sources of pollution chen et al 2013a research has not established whether antibiotic contaminants far below sub inhibitory concentrations could exert significant selective stresses on the arb and args in the ambient environment luo et al 2011 zhang et al 2013 for example the amoxicillin concentration in seawater from victoria harbour in hong kong was below the limit of quantification 5 0 ng l xu et al 2007 but minimum inhibitory concentrations mic of amoxicillin to some pathogens e g v anguillarum and p damsel were as high as 40 and 80 ng ml respectively mazzolini et al 1997 we estimated that amoxicillin concentration in the water of bullfrog ponds was approximately 130 ng ml when it was administered as a result amoxicillin resistant bacteria were able to increase more than other susceptible species under significant selective pressure in the bullfrog ponds furthermore arg pollution was difficult to ameliorate or eliminate once it was formed in comparison to the active bullfrog ponds arg abundance was not obviously diminished in the sediments from pond n2 where rearing operations had ceased for 3 months research has also reported that tetracycline resistance genes persisted at aquaculture farms in the absence of selective stress tamminen et al 2011 args have been so recalcitrant to elimination from the aquatic environment due to the proliferation of arb and considerable stability of edna in sediment mao et al 2014 zhu 2006 microbes have been able to horizontally acquire args via transformation or conjugation under antibiotic stresses resulting in arg accumulation in environments polluted with high concentrations of antibiotics capkin et al 2017 cottell et al 2014 turner et al 2014 such lateral transfers of args needed to employ plasmids as the shuttling carriers between bacterial hosts wang et al 2015 the present study demonstrated that the plasmids likely present in the sediments from the bullfrog farm carried a considerable amount of arg subtypes related to different antibiotic categories furthermore sequence abundances that were closely related to arg carried plasmids e g nz cp014648 1 nz cp004000 1 nc 022078 1 were consistently higher in the sediments from the bullfrog ponds and the drainage ditch than those from the headrace channel significant relationships between plasmids and args were also often observed in various environmental settings chen et al 2013b ma et al 2014 a significant correlation between the total abundance of arg related plasmids and that of plasmid carrying args suggested that plasmids could have played important roles in the dissemination of args in the aquaculture environment determining the main chemical stresses responsible for arg pollution in the natural environment was difficult resistance genes associated with different types of contaminants may have concomitantly resided in the chromosomes and or plasmids of microbes li et al 2017 heavy metal contaminants were frequently linked to arg pollution because the concurrence of metal and antibiotic resistant genes in the plasmids facilitated the dissemination of args under the elevated pressure exerted by heavy metals li et al 2015 zhai et al 2016 args had also greatly accumulated in the pahs polluted soils likely due to args being present in the chromosomes of pah tolerant microbes chen et al 2017 all of these studies determined that chemical incentives for arg pollution in various environments were diverse and complicated in this study the use of beta lactams and aminoglycosides in the bullfrog farm could have also enriched args related to other antibiotics similarly we hypothesized that args conferring resistance to different antibiotic categories were carried concurrently by one plasmid or bacterial host most of the plasmids likely identified in the sediments from the bullfrog farm carried multiple arg subtypes consequently the stress exerted by any of the antibiotics could have resulted in simultaneous enrichment of all plasmid carrying args in the environment where antibiotics were directly applied under the local selective conditions plasmids contributed not only to the adaptation of individual prokaryotic species but also to that of the prokaryotic community as a whole sentchilo et al 2013 in contrast the abundance of both arg related plasmids and args potentially carried by the plasmids was lower in the tibetan and pahs contaminated environments chen et al 2016 2017 therefore all findings determined that the concurrence of args associated with different antibiotics in the plasmids may have been responsible for the complex pollution of args related to different antibiotic categories under the stress of an individual antibiotic administered to the aquaculture farm 5 conclusion to summarize the use of beta lactams and aminoglycosides in bullfrog farms resulted in the enrichment of multiple args a large portion of args was associated with antibiotics not applied during the aquaculture operations this suggested that arg pollution was not solely caused by the counterparts of antibiotics linked to resistance genes the args related to different antibiotic categories may have recombined into one single plasmid hence facilitating the dissemination of args under the stresses of antibiotics therefore knowledge regarding the abundance and diversity of plasmid carrying args is critical to understanding the formation of arg pollution as well as to developing effective methods
