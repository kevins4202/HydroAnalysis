is in favor of pms activation compared to manganese oxide mo cemo 5 and cemo 9 an obvious left shift has been observed in the mn 2p of cemo 7 suggesting that some electrons are transferred from mn atoms to ce atoms in cemo 7 and implying that the highest degradation efficiency of cemo 7 in tc degradation may be due to the strong electronic interaction between ce and mn in cemo 7 this study not only offers a facile and high efficiency methodology for the synthesis of two dimensional nanomaterial but also proposes a new idea for enhancing the removal of tc graphical abstract unlabelled image

century environmental pollution and energy crisis have become two increasingly serious problems all over the world 1 4 as a matter of fact the survival and development of all human beings are severely threatened by multitudinous chemical contaminants as the rapid development of society 5 8 more and more attention is paid to the food borne diseases and potential health hazards induced by long time ingestion of poisonous contaminants 9 14 tetracycline tc as one of the most common antibiotics has been widely applied in the healthcare industry pharmaceutical livestock and aquaculture industry for treating various common diseases or growth promoters 15 21 however the most part of antibiotics could not be absorbed and metabolized by mankind animal and aquaculture organisms they are further excreted into water ecosystem via urine and faeces resulting in the increasingly serious accumulation in the aquatic environment 22 25 which is arousing a serious potential threat to the human health and ecological environment 26 28 as a consequence a variety of technologies including physical adsorption 29 30 biological treatment 31 32 flocculation 33 electrocatalysis 34 photocatalysis 35 and advanced oxidation processes aops 36 39 have been developed for tc degradation recently so4 based aops have been widely applied for tc degradation in the environment due to their excellent redox

44 and metal oxide 45 among them manganese dioxide mo has been widely used in the degradation of pollutant substances due to its low cost high abundance thermal stability structural flexibility environmental safety and easy preparation 46 49 in 2012 the wang group first reported mno2 catalytic degradation of phenol via pms activation in aqueous solutions 50 since then multifarious strategies including oxygen vacancies or surface defects improvement morphology modification crystal phase transition and ion doping are developed for improving the catalytic performance of mno2 in the degradation of pollutant substances 51 our laboratory has been working on the modification of manganese dioxide and its application in the pollutant degradation 52 54 for example our group reported a tridimensional ce and bi co doped mno2 octahedral molecular sieve oms 2 nanomaterial ce bi oms 2 for efficient removal of bisphenol a via o2 activation at 30 c 55 herein we are employing the as synthesized ce doping manganese oxide cemo nanorods as efficient catalysts for the enhanced tc removal via electronic interaction effect at 30 c for the first time subsequently we scrutinized the kinetics behavior and relationship between catalytic activity and surface structure of cemo nanorods for tc removal via pms activation in addition the detailed mechanism is also studied by quenching

been purchased from aladdin reagent co ltd chlortetracycline ctc from shanghai macklin biochemical co 2 2 synthesis of cemo nanorods in typical manganese sulfate 8 8 g 0 052 mol and concentrated nitric acid 3 ml were dissolved in 30 ml of deionized water next cerium nitrate hexahydrate 1 06 g 0 00245 mol ce mn 7 wt was added into the manganese sulfate solution under stirring condition a 100 ml of potassium permanganate solution 5 89 g 0 037 mol had been added into the above mixture the resulting mixture has been stirred continuously at 100 c for 24 h finally the mixture was cooled to 25 c and filtered then washed with water the obtained material was dried in an oven at 120 c for 8 h under air and calcined in a muffle furnace at 300 c for 3 h under air the resulting material was named cemo 7 similarly cemo x x 0 5 and 9 were obtained by the same condition via the use of appropriate quantities of cerium nitrate hexahydrate 2 3 experimental procedure in typical the tc removals has been performed on uv 1900 shimadzu company under exposure to air at 30 c 55 in general cemo 7 nanorods 0 25 g l 1 pms 0 25 g l 1 and tc 20 mg l 1 have been added into a round neck flask with 50 ml of h2o the mixture solution has been stirred for indicated time under ambient conditions 1 ml of sample solution has been obtained from the mixture solution and analyzed by uv vis spectra under the maximum adsorption wavelength after the simple filtration by a thin film the degradation rate has been calculated as degradation efficiency c 0 c t c 0 100 where c0 and ct are the initial and final concentration of tc which are determined by uv absorbance value total organic carbon toc has been obtained on the toc l cpn from shimadzu company following the removal conditions as 20 mg l 1 of tc 0 25 g l 1 of cemo 7 nanorod and 0 25 g l 1 of pms the mineralization rate has been determined when the degradation was finished mineralization efficiency t 0 t t t 0 100 where t 0 and t t are the initial and final value of toc 3 result and discussion 3 1 structural characterizations of cemos first manganese dioxide mo has been obtained following the reported procedure 56 as shown in fig 1 a series of ce doping manganese oxide cemo nanocomposites have been designed and prepared by the pre incorporation method from kmno4 mnso4 and different amounts of ce no3 3 6h2o ce to mn ratios of 5 wt 7 wt and 9 wt the corresponding products are denoted as cemo 5 cemo 7 and cemo 9 respectively then the morphology of these cemo nanocomposites have been characterized by transmission electron microscope tem as displayed in fig 2a mo presents a regular nanorod morphology of mno2 with the average length of 7 μm and width of 20 nm the length of mno2 nanorods decreased from 7 μm to 1 56 μm fig 2b 1 60 μm fig 2c and 1 87 μm fig 2d when the doping content of ce enhanced to 5 wt 7 wt and 9 wt respectively while width of mno2 nanorods increased from 20 nm to 22 nm cemo 5 28 nm cemo 7 and 31 nm cemo 9 it is clear that the long and thin nanorods were transformed to short and thick nanorods due to the dopant loading of ce as shown in fig s1 the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms bet of these cemo nanocomposites have also been recorded and summarized in table 1 the result indicates that the dosage of ce doping significantly affected the textural properties of these cemo nanocomposites with the increase of ce doping dosage the surface area pore volume and pore size of mno2 nanorods decreased from 133 6 m2 g 0 67 cm3 g and 20 2 nm to 66 4 m2 g 0 27 cm3 g and 16 2 nm respectively further confirming that ce atoms have been doped into frameworks of mno2 nanorods then these cemo nanocomposites have been further characterized by temperature programmed reduction h2 tpr and temperature programmed oxidation o2 tpd as displayed in fig s2a among these cemo nanocomposites cemo 7 nanocomposite shows the highest reduction peaks located at 200 400 c due to the presence of ce and mno6 h 56 compared with mo fig s2b these cemo nanocomposites possess abundant surface reactive oxygen species at 450 to 700 c it is obvious that the concentration of oxygen vacancy is greatly increased by the doping of ce atoms which are beneficial to pms activation 57 in summary these results exhibit that cemo 7 nanocomposite possesses a two dimensional nanorod morphology with abundant surface reactive oxygen species which is in favor for the efficient removal of tc via pms activation 58 3 2 catalytic performances of mo cemo 5 cemo 7 and cemo 9 in tc degradation for comparison their catalytic performance in the removal of tetracycline via pms activation at 30 c has been studied in fig s3 the tc removal was carried out with 20 mg l 1 of tc 0 25 g l 1 of pms in the presence of 0 25 g l 1 of mo cemo 5 cemo 7 or cemo 9 at 30 c in 50 ml of water for 30 min respectively among these cemo nanocomposites cemo 7 exhibits the highest degradation efficiency 99 in the catalytic degradation of tc in 5 min furthermore the mineralization degree of tc degradation 20 mg l 1 of tc catalyzed by cemo 7 nanorods is measured to be 64 9 table 2 while the pure mo only provides 50 mineralization degree therefore cemo 7 nanorod is selected as the optimized catalyst for further kinetic study and mechanistic insights of efficient tc removal via pms activation in order to further study the localization of ce atoms in the mo nanorods high resolution tem hrtem xrd edx mappings and xps of cemo 7 have been characterized as shown in fig 3a the lattice fringes of cemo 7 are clearly found to be 0 69 nm and 0 30 nm being consistent with the 110 and 310 crystal planes of cryptomelane type mno2 59 60 in fig 3b the characteristic peaks of 110 200 220 310 211 301 411 600 521 002 600 and 312 cryptomelane are appeared in the x ray diffraction xrd spectrum jcpds card no 29 1020 confirming cemo 7 is the cryptomelane type mno2 no diffraction had been detected for the ce element in cemo 7 from xrd patterns which indicates that ce loading in cemo 7 is too low in fig 3c the co existence of ce mn k and o elements in the cemo 7 nanorods has also been verified by sum xps spectrum the high resolution mn 2p3 2 spectra of cemo 7 has been divided into three characteristic peaks at 641 67 ev 642 43 ev and 643 40 ev which are assigned to mnii 32 9 mniii 26 1 and mniv 41 species respectively fig 3d the fig 3e exhibits that ce 3d5 2 spectrum of cemo 7 nanorods is fitted into two typical peaks at 882 58 ev and 885 92 ev attributed to ceiii 46 7 resp ceiv 53 3 as displayed in fig 3f the o 1s spectrum of cemo 7 nanorods is decomposed into olatt 529 80 ev 65 4 oads 531 20 ev 15 9 resp oh2o 532 17 ev 18 7 further confirming cemo 7 nanocomposite possesses abundant surface reactive oxygen species which is in favor for the efficient removal of tc via pms activation 61 as presented in fig 4a e ce mn and o elements have been uniformly distributed on the cemo 7 confirming that ce atoms are successfully doped into crystal lattices of cryptomelane type mno2 furthermore the edx sum spectrum also provides powerful evidence for the presence of ce mn and o elements in the cemo 7 nanorods fig 4f in addition xps of mo cemo 5 and cemo 9 has also been measured for comparison with cemo 7 table 1 as shown in fig s4 there is a left shift in the mn 2p of cemo 7 as compared to these of mo cemo 5 and cemo 9 suggesting that some electrons are transferred from mn atoms to ce atoms in cemo 7 and implying that there is a strong electronic interaction between the ce and mn in cemo 7 62 therefore the highest degradation efficiency of cemo 7 in tc degradation may be due to the strong electronic interaction between ce and mn in cemo 7 3 3 kinetic study of tc degradation in the cemo 7 pms system since cemo 7 nanorods exhibited fantastic degradation efficiency in tc degradation via pms activation its further detailed kinetic study is investigated by varying initial tc concentration the amount of cemo 7 nanorods pms dosage and reaction temperature on tc degradation the catalytic activities of tc degradation with various initial tc concentration are shown in fig 5a the degradation efficiency decreases with the enhancement of initial concentration of tc from 10 mg l 1 to 30 mg l 1 it is obvious that the initial concentration of tc plays a distinct negative role on tc degradation conversely an increase in cemo 7 nanorods dosage from 0 1 g l 1 to 0 3 g l 1 plays a remarkable positive role on tc degradation as displayed in fig 5b the slope of tc degradation efficiency vs the amount of cemo 7 nanorods is 1 which indicates that the degradation of tc is the first order kinetic in catalyst concentration similarly pms dosage also exhibits a positive linear relationship with initial tc degradation rate fig 5c the effect of reaction temperature has been investigated in fig 5d the tc degradation rate increases with the increment of reaction temperature from 273 to 313 k in summary tc degradation is the first order kinetic in the initial concentration of tc catalyst concentration and reaction temperature the activation energy e a of tc degradation is found to be 6 94 kj mol arrhenius equation moreover some common organic pollutants including chlortetracycline ctc fig s5a oxytetracycline otc fig s5b ciprofloxacin cpfx fig s5c and rhodamine b rhb fig s5d have also been completely degraded by cemo 7 pms system 3 4 stability of the cemo 7 catalyst in tc degradation for studying the further practical and industrial application of the as obtained cemo 7 nanorods the durability and stability of the present cemo 7 nanorods are consideration and the recycling tests are conducted in fig 6 the cemo 7 nanorods have been separated re obtained and used by a simple filtration after each tc degradation the result exhibits that the degradation efficiency of tc after 5 runs still remained more than 90 within 30 min indicating that cemo 7 nanorods is an excellent stable and recyclable catalyst in addition the 5th recycled cemo 7 nanorods has further been measured by tem as displayed in fig s6 it is clear that the nanorods morphology of cemo 7 is partly destroyed in the lifetime of pms exposure as a result a gradual decrease was observed in the tc degradation efficiency after each run even so a 99 degradation of tc was reached within 10 min after the 5th reuse of cemo 7 nanorods confirming the stability of cemo 7 nanorods 3 5 the inorganic anions effect on tc degradation generally a variety of inorganic anions have been widely detected in natural water and could influence tc degradation then the effect of typical inorganic anions such as so4 2 cl h2po4 hco3 and no3 have also been recorded in fig 7 we find that so4 2 cl hco3 and no3 hardly affect tc degradation while h2po4 plays a significant inhibiting effect on the removal of tc because h2po4 adsorbed and attached on the surface oh groups of cemo 7 nanocomposite covered the active sites thus inhibited tc degradation 63 64 this result further confirmed that cemo 7 abundant surface reactive oxygen species which is in favor for the efficient removal of tc via pms activation 3 6 quenching experiments and epr analysis in order to identify the reactive oxygen species ros in the cemo 7 pms system the quenching experiments with etoh tertiary butanol tba benzoquinone bq and nan3 have been performed in 0 25 g l 1 of cemo 7 0 25 g l 1 of pms and 20 mg l 1 of tc at 30 c first etoh is commonly used as effective scavengers for both oh k oh 1 2 2 8 109 m 1 s 1 and so4 kso4 1 6 7 7 107 m 1 s 1 while tba is only used as effective scavengers for oh k oh 6 0 108 m 1 s 1 then benzoquinone bq and nan3 are applied for quenching o2 and 1o2 respectively 65 67 as shown in fig 8a bq and nan3 play a negligible role whereas etoh and tba play an obvious inhibiting role in tc degradation indicating that so4 and oh are primary ros in the cemo 7 pms system for further demonstrating the ros in the cemo 7 pms system epr detection is also carried out in fig 8b it is clear that the typical peaks of 1 2 2 1 and 1 1 1 1 signals have been clearly observed for verifying the presence of so4 and oh in the cemo 7 pms system a small characteristic peaks of temp 1o2 with 1 1 1 intensity ratio appear in epr spectrum conforming the existence of 1o2 in the cemo 7 pms system while the typical peaks of dmps o2 does not found in epr spectrum in summary these quenching tests and epr analysis have confirmed that oh and so4 are primary ros in the cemo 7 pms system 3 7 proposed mechanism of tc degradation based the above inorganic anions effect quenching experiments epr results and previously published literature 68 70 a possible mechanism of tc degradation catalyzed by cemo 7 nanorods via pms activation is proposed in fig 9 first tc and pms molecules were attached and adsorbed on the surface of cemo 7 nanorods then pms molecules were activated by cemo 7 nanorods via electron transfer to form oh and so4 finally tc molecules were decomposed into small organic intermediates after attack of oh and so4 and further mineralized to h2o and co2 3 8 comparison the catalytic performance of cemo 7 with other catalytic systems in the removal of tc has been compared in table 3 71 79 it is obvious that initial concentration of tc catalyst amount oxidizing agent other additive removal efficiency reaction time and reaction constant are provided the result shows that as obtained cemo 7 nanorods reached 99 0 degradation efficiency in only 5 min with highest reaction constant of 3 96 mg l 1 min 1 as a consequence the comparison table further confirmed that cemo 7 nanorods as an excellent and heterogeneous nano catalyst can activate pms for tc removal and the cemo 7 pms system is very comparable with other catalytic systems in the removal of tc 3 9 competing reactions in mixed solutions the catalytic performance of cemo 7 in the removal of mixed pollutant has been measured in the fig 10 as shown in fig 10a cemo 7 nanorod provided the similar degradation efficiency in both tc and rhb while cemo 7 nanorod gave a higher degradation efficiency of ao7 removal than that of otc degradation fig 10b as displayed in fig 10c cemo 7 nanorod also provided the similar degradation efficiency in both ctc and rr2 in the mixture of cpfx ao7 and rhb the order of degradation efficiency follows ao7 rhb cpfx indicating dye pollutant especially containing azos group is more easily than antibiotic pollutant to be degraded in the cemo 7 pms system fig 10d 4 conclusion in summary the ce doping manganese oxide cemo nanorods have been employed as efficient catalysts for enhanced removal of tetracycline via electronic interaction effect at 30 c for the first time cemo nanorods have been designed and prepared by the pre incorporation method from kmno4 mnso4 and different amounts of ce no3 3 6h2o ce to mn ratios of 5 wt 7 wt and 9 wt among them cemo 7 nanorods exhibited the highest degradation efficiency 99 in the catalytic degradation of tc the detailed characterizations and anions effect experiment have confirmed that cemo 7 nanorods possessed abundant surface reactive oxygen species which is in favor for the activation of pms compared to mo cemo 5 and cemo 9 an obvious left shift has been observed in the mn 2p of cemo 7 suggesting that some electrons are transferred from mn atoms to ce atoms in cemo 7 and implying that the highest degradation efficiency of cemo 7 in tc degradation may be due to the strong electronic interaction between ce and mn in cemo 7 based on arrhenius equation the activation energy e a of tc degradation is found to be only 6 94 kj mol the free radical quenching tests and epr analysis have confirmed that oh and so4 are primary reactive oxygen species in cemo 7 pms system in addition this cemo 7 nanorods has been successfully recycled at least 5 runs with only slightly degradation efficiency loss in tc degradation via pms activation the comparison table further confirmed that cemo 7 nanorods as an excellent and heterogeneous nano catalyst can activate pms for tc removal and the cemo 7 pms system is very comparable with other catalytic systems in the removal of tc this work provides a facile and high efficiency nano catalyst for tc degradation declaration of competing interest the authors declare no competing financial

0 30 nm being consistent with the 110 and 310 crystal planes of cryptomelane type mno2 59 60 in fig 3b the characteristic peaks of 110 200 220 310 211 301 411 600 521 002 600 and 312 cryptomelane are appeared in the x ray diffraction xrd spectrum jcpds card no 29 1020 confirming cemo 7 is the cryptomelane type mno2 no diffraction had been detected for the ce element in cemo 7 from xrd patterns which indicates that ce loading in cemo 7 is too low in fig 3c the co existence of ce mn k and o elements in the cemo 7 nanorods has also been verified by sum xps spectrum the high resolution mn 2p3 2 spectra of cemo 7 has been divided into three characteristic peaks at 641 67 ev 642 43 ev and 643 40 ev which are assigned to mnii 32 9 mniii 26 1 and mniv 41 species respectively fig 3d the fig 3e exhibits that ce 3d5 2 spectrum of cemo 7 nanorods is fitted into two typical peaks at 882 58 ev and 885 92 ev attributed to ceiii 46 7 resp ceiv 53 3 as displayed in fig 3f the o 1s spectrum of cemo 7 nanorods is decomposed into olatt 529 80 ev 65 4 oads 531 20 ev 15 9 resp oh2o 532 17 ev 18 7 further confirming cemo 7 nanocomposite possesses abundant surface reactive oxygen species which is in favor for the efficient removal of tc via pms activation 61 as presented in fig 4a e ce mn and o elements have been uniformly distributed on the cemo 7 confirming that ce atoms are successfully doped into crystal lattices of cryptomelane type mno2 furthermore the edx sum spectrum also provides powerful evidence for the presence of ce mn and o elements in the cemo 7 nanorods fig 4f in addition xps of mo cemo 5 and cemo 9 has also been measured for comparison with cemo 7 table 1 as shown in fig s4 there is a left shift in the mn 2p of cemo 7 as compared to these of mo cemo 5 and cemo 9 suggesting that some electrons are transferred from mn atoms to ce atoms in cemo 7 and implying that there is a strong electronic interaction between the ce and mn in cemo 7 62 therefore the highest degradation efficiency of cemo 7 in tc degradation may be due to the strong electronic interaction between ce and mn in cemo 7 3 3 kinetic study of tc degradation in the cemo 7 pms system since cemo 7 nanorods exhibited fantastic degradation efficiency in tc degradation via pms activation its further detailed kinetic study is investigated by varying initial tc concentration the amount of cemo 7 nanorods pms dosage and reaction temperature on tc degradation the catalytic activities of tc degradation with various initial tc concentration are shown in fig 5a the degradation efficiency decreases with the enhancement of initial concentration of tc from 10 mg l 1 to 30 mg l 1 it is obvious that the initial concentration of tc plays a distinct negative role on tc degradation conversely an increase in cemo 7 nanorods dosage from 0 1 g l 1 to 0 3 g l 1 plays a remarkable positive role on tc degradation as displayed in fig 5b the slope of tc degradation efficiency vs the amount of cemo 7 nanorods is 1 which indicates that the degradation of tc is the first order kinetic in catalyst concentration similarly pms dosage also exhibits a positive linear relationship with initial tc degradation rate fig 5c the effect of reaction temperature has been investigated in fig 5d the tc degradation rate increases with the increment of reaction temperature from 273 to 313 k in summary tc degradation is the first order kinetic in the initial concentration of tc catalyst concentration and reaction temperature the activation energy e a of tc degradation is found to be 6 94 kj mol arrhenius equation moreover some common organic pollutants including chlortetracycline ctc fig s5a oxytetracycline otc fig s5b ciprofloxacin cpfx fig s5c and rhodamine b rhb fig s5d have also been completely degraded by cemo 7 pms system 3 4 stability of the cemo 7 catalyst in tc degradation for studying the further practical and industrial application of the as obtained cemo 7 nanorods the durability and stability of the present cemo 7 nanorods are consideration and the recycling tests are conducted in fig 6 the cemo 7 nanorods have been separated re obtained and used by a simple filtration after each tc degradation the result exhibits that the degradation efficiency of tc after 5 runs still remained more than 90 within 30 min indicating that cemo 7 nanorods is an excellent stable and recyclable catalyst in addition the 5th recycled cemo 7 nanorods has further been measured by tem as displayed in fig s6 it is clear that the nanorods morphology of cemo 7 is partly destroyed in the lifetime of pms exposure as a result a gradual decrease was observed in the tc degradation efficiency after each run even so a 99 degradation of tc was reached within 10 min after the 5th reuse of cemo 7 nanorods confirming the stability of cemo 7 nanorods 3 5 the inorganic anions effect on tc degradation generally a variety of inorganic anions have been widely detected in natural water and could influence tc degradation then the effect of typical inorganic anions such as so4 2 cl h2po4 hco3 and no3 have also been recorded in fig 7 we find that so4 2 cl hco3 and no3 hardly affect tc degradation while h2po4 plays a significant inhibiting effect on the removal of tc because h2po4 adsorbed and attached on the surface oh groups of cemo 7 nanocomposite covered the active sites thus inhibited tc degradation 63 64 this result further confirmed that cemo 7 abundant surface reactive oxygen species which is in favor for the efficient removal of tc via pms activation 3 6 quenching experiments and epr analysis in order to identify the reactive oxygen species ros in the cemo 7 pms system the quenching experiments with etoh tertiary butanol tba benzoquinone bq and nan3 have been performed in 0 25 g l 1 of cemo 7 0 25 g l 1 of pms and 20 mg l 1 of tc at 30 c first etoh is commonly used as effective scavengers for both oh k oh 1 2 2 8 109 m 1 s 1 and so4 kso4 1 6 7 7 107 m 1 s 1 while tba is only used as effective scavengers for oh k oh 6 0 108 m 1 s 1 then benzoquinone bq and nan3 are applied for quenching o2 and 1o2 respectively 65 67 as shown in fig 8a bq and nan3 play a negligible role whereas etoh and tba play an obvious inhibiting role in tc degradation indicating that so4 and oh are primary ros in the cemo 7 pms system for further demonstrating the ros in the cemo 7 pms system epr detection is also carried out in fig 8b it is clear that the typical peaks of 1 2 2 1 and 1 1 1 1 signals have been clearly observed for verifying the presence of so4 and oh in the cemo 7 pms system a small characteristic peaks of temp 1o2 with 1 1 1 intensity ratio appear in epr spectrum conforming the existence of 1o2 in the cemo 7 pms system while the typical peaks of dmps o2 does not found in epr spectrum in summary these quenching tests and epr analysis have confirmed that oh and so4 are primary ros in the cemo 7 pms system 3 7 proposed mechanism of tc degradation based the above inorganic anions effect quenching experiments epr results and previously published literature 68 70 a possible mechanism of tc degradation catalyzed by cemo 7 nanorods via pms activation is proposed in fig 9 first tc and pms molecules were attached and adsorbed on the surface of cemo 7 nanorods then pms molecules were activated by cemo 7 nanorods via electron transfer to form oh and so4 finally tc molecules were decomposed into small organic intermediates after attack of oh and so4 and further mineralized to h2o and co2 3 8 comparison the catalytic performance of cemo 7 with other catalytic systems in the removal of tc has been compared in table 3 71 79 it is obvious that initial concentration of tc catalyst amount oxidizing agent other additive removal efficiency reaction time and reaction constant are provided the result shows that as obtained cemo 7 nanorods reached 99 0 degradation efficiency in only 5 min with highest reaction constant of 3 96 mg l 1 min 1 as a consequence the comparison table further confirmed that cemo 7 nanorods as an excellent and heterogeneous nano catalyst can activate pms for tc removal and the cemo 7 pms system is very comparable with other catalytic systems in the removal of tc 3 9 competing reactions in mixed solutions the catalytic performance of cemo 7 in the removal of mixed pollutant has been measured in the fig 10 as shown in fig 10a cemo 7 nanorod provided the similar degradation efficiency in both tc and rhb while cemo 7 nanorod gave a higher degradation efficiency of ao7 removal than that of otc degradation fig 10b as displayed in fig 10c cemo 7 nanorod also provided the similar degradation efficiency in both ctc and rr2 in the mixture of cpfx ao7 and rhb the order of degradation efficiency follows ao7 rhb cpfx indicating dye pollutant especially containing azos group is more easily than antibiotic pollutant to be degraded in the cemo 7 pms system fig 10d 4 conclusion in summary the ce doping manganese oxide cemo nanorods have been employed as efficient catalysts for enhanced removal of tetracycline via electronic interaction effect at 30 c for the first time cemo nanorods have been designed and prepared by the pre incorporation method from kmno4 mnso4 and different amounts of ce no3 3 6h2o ce to mn ratios of 5 wt 7 wt and 9 wt among them cemo 7 nanorods exhibited the highest degradation efficiency 99 in the catalytic degradation of tc the detailed characterizations and anions effect experiment have confirmed that cemo 7 nanorods possessed abundant surface reactive oxygen species which is in favor for the activation of pms compared to mo cemo 5 and cemo 9 an obvious left shift has been observed in the mn 2p of cemo 7 suggesting that some electrons are transferred from mn atoms to ce atoms in cemo 7 and implying that the highest degradation efficiency of cemo 7 in tc degradation may be due to the strong electronic interaction between ce and mn in cemo 7 based on arrhenius equation the activation energy e a of tc degradation is found to be only 6 94 kj mol the free radical quenching tests and epr analysis have confirmed that oh and so4 are primary reactive oxygen species in cemo 7 pms system in addition this cemo 7 nanorods has been successfully recycled at least 5 runs with only slightly degradation efficiency loss in tc degradation via pms activation the comparison table further confirmed that cemo 7 nanorods as an excellent and heterogeneous nano catalyst can activate pms for tc removal and the cemo 7 pms system is very comparable with other catalytic systems in the removal of tc this work provides a facile and high efficiency nano catalyst for tc degradation declaration of competing interest the authors declare no competing financial

university of architecture and technology no 13 yanta road xi an shanxi china ammonia nitrogen removal with the aid of sulfate in sewage itself under anaerobic condition is thought to bring a great advantage for domestic wastewater treatment but how to achieve it is yet to be fully understood ammonia oxidation in high strong chemical oxygen demand cod condition in a upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor was studied and the valence state change of iron ion during the ammonia oxidation and sulfate reduction aosr were investigated in this study the experimental results show that aosr reaction was successfully realized in the uasb within the removal rates of ammonia nitrogen and sulfate were above 80 and 70 respectively the experiments of adding ammonia nitrogen or sulfate independently have proved that the denitrification and desulfurization reactions can be carried out independently in the batch test adding 40 mg l iron ion significantly improved the efficiency of ammonia removal and noted the production of ferrous ion in the test the total amount of iron ions almost did not change so it was judged that ammonia was removed by anaerobic iron ammonia oxidation in addition the reaction also occurred in organic wastewaters with different carbon source and the effect of glucose was the most obvious this study shows that in high cod environment ammonium oxidation and iron reduction can take place at the same time rather than sulfate reduction and ferrous ion is oxidized to ferric ion and sulfate reduction at the same time which indicates that it might be used to remove ammonia from domestic sewage keywords ammonia oxidation sulfate reduction ammonia oxidation carbon source feammox wastewater data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nitrogen compound pollution is one of the main concerns threatening clean water production for during the anthropocene 1 nitrates and nitrites in drinking water can carry cancer risks 2 and ammonia can cause eutrophication of water bodies 3 nitrous oxide is a strong greenhouse gas 4 which is mainly generated in the nitrification and denitrification reactions in the denitrification process of sewage 5 therefore it is necessary to remove nitrogen compounds efficiently variety of effective treatment processes have been developed such as simultaneous nitrification and denitrification 6 anaerobic ammonia oxidation 7 denitrifying ammonium oxidation deamox 8 however nitrification in wastewater treatment will consume a lot of energy and denitrification can only be achieved with sufficient organic carbon source 6 these disadvantages usually limit the biological removal of nitrogen in wastewater in practice in anaerobic environment it has been found that anammox bacteria can use ammonia as electron donor and nitrite as electron acceptor to remove nitrogen from wastewater 9 however due to the lack of nitrite in the raw wastewater it is necessary to add nitrite or oxidize part of ammonium to nitrite to participate in the reaction 7 this not only increases operating costs but also reduces efficiency 10 denitrifying ammonium oxidation is based on anaerobic ammonium oxidation simultaneously coupled with short range denitrification it makes the whole denitrification process easier and more stable but it still has the problem of long process and high cost 11 12 at the same time the operation of sewage treatment facilities is also an important part of sewage treatment large amount of energy saving in addition to improved effluent quality could be achieved through operational changes for example during the operation of the denitrification process the relationship between the reduction of ammonia nitrogen and the increase of nitrogen oxides can be balanced by setting the srt reasonably so as to achieve the goal of efficient and energy saving operation of the sewage treatment plant 13 the treatment efficiency of sewage treatment facilities is also affected by weather the impact load of cod and ammonia nitrogen in the influent of sewage treatment facilities will increase due to the dilution effect in wet weather 14 some sewage treatment facilities have achieved energy autarky by adopting nitritation anammox process to increase hrt of the primary clarifier to improve biogas production and reduce aeration energy for bod removal and nitrification 15 ammonia is one of the most important pollutants in wastewater treatment and ammonia removal affects the efficiency economy and reuse of the entire wastewater treatment process therefore an efficient and economical ammonia removal process is very necessary in recent years it has been found that another anammox pathway may exist in the natural environment sulfate anammox that is sulfate is used as an electron acceptor to oxidize ammonia nitrogen to nitrogen 16 18 domestic sewage usually contains a certain amount of sulfate therefore because of its low harm it is usually not treated in the sewage treatment plant if this part of sulfate can be used to remove ammonia nitrogen compared with nitrite reducting anammox reaction the nitrogen removal process will be more simply and the use of pollutants in wastewater will be more thorough which will have a good prospect in the efficiency and economy of wastewater treatment due to the discovery of sulfate reducing anammox reaction and the derivation of general reaction equation from thermodynamics 16 there is no consensus on its specific realization path and reaction mechanism some studies have attempted to initiate sulfate reducing anammox in autotrophic environment 19 there is also case of startup of it in heterotrophic environments 20 21 some researchers believe that the reaction is caused by anaerobic sulfate reducing reaction 22 ammonia oxidizing bacteria are independent in which denitrification and desulfurization are carried out simultaneously some researchers have also found that the reaction was a mixed action of multi bacteria in which sulfate first oxidized ammonia nitrogen to nitrite and then denitrified it by anammox 23 however in anaerobic environment there is still no reliable evidence whether microorganisms can use sulfate to oxidize ammonia generally speaking in anaerobic environment denitrifying bacteria will use organic matter and nitrate for denitrification reaction 24 if sulfate is also present special sulfate reducing bacteria use organic matter mainly organic acids such as lactic acid to reduce sulfate to sulfide ions in a highly anaerobic and reducing environment 25 although it is not normal there are few reports on anaerobic sulfate reducing bacteria in anaerobic environment with organic substance exist and there is still a lack of in depth study on the biotransformation of ammonia and sulfate in our previous experiment of hydrogen production by anaerobic fermentation of organic matter the removal of ammonia and the reduction of sulfate were found 26 it was speculated that the reaction should be sulfate type anammox based on this we try to establish an aosr reaction system that can be quickly started and run efficiently in the laboratory in this study the transformation processes of nitrogen and sulfur were analyzed separately and the possible relationships among them were analyzed and a possible mechanistic explanation for that anaerobic iron ammonia oxidation reaction and sulfate reduction reaction jointly complete the aosr process was proposed 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge acclimation and simulation experiment a uasb reactor was used to perform the simulation experiment as shown in the fig 1 the uasb reactor was a column of 90 cm in height 16 cm in diameter and an effective volume of 5 l the daily inflow was 12 l and the hrt 10 h the reactor temperature was controlled at 38 1 c the biogas generated in the reactor was discharged through the air outlet and its volume was measured by a wet gas flow meter the sludge inoculated in the reactor was obtained from the flocculent sludge from the anaerobic methane fermentation uasb of a brewery in xi an city china after the inoculation the sludge concentration in the reactor was controlled at about 12 000 mg l the synthetic wastewater distribution was used for the experiment the glucose ammonium chloride and anhydrous sodium sulfate were used as the carbon nitrogen and sulfur sources when the reactor started the cod was the 2000 mg l nh4 n 10 mg l so4 2 s 10 mg l and fe2 3 mg l a certain amount of the sodium bicarbonate and potassium dihydrogen phosphate determined according to the ph of the outlet water were added into the water distribution to maintain the ph of 7 2 0 5 in the reactor the ph of the wastewater was adjusted to about 7 5 2 2 batch experiment a 200 ml serum bottle was used for batch experiment before the experiment a corresponding numbers of serum bottles were prepared according to the experimental design and the parallel samples were prepared respectively the sludge which acclimated successfully in the uasb reactor was applied by the sludge in the bottle after the sludge was centrifuged in a centrifuge at the 4000 r min for 5 min and then the same weight was weighed respectively and added to the serum bottle among them the sewage configuration mode of conventional reaction was cod 6000 mg l nh4 n 100 mg l so4 2 s 40 mg l fe2 5 mg l potassium dihydrogen phosphate 500 mg l sodium bicarbonate appropriate amount adjusting the solution ph to 7 5 and the other trace elements another batch experiment was conducted on the sewage of the primary sedimentation tank of the 4th xi an municipal wastewater treatment plant the water quality is as shown in the table 1 2 3 analysis method nh4 n salicylic acid hypochlorite salt spectrophotometry so4 2 s barium chromate photometric method s2 s p aminodimethylaniline photometric method cod potassium dichromate method tn potassium persulfate digestion method ph glass electrode method the vfa was determined by the gas chromatography the column type was db waxetr determination conditions the sample was started to run at 80 c then heated to 100 c at the rate of 20 c min 1 then heated to 180 c at the rate of 10 c min 1 and finally rapidly rose to 220 c at the rate of 30 c min 1 each injection quantity was 0 5 μl the ferric and ferrous ions were determined by the phenanthroline spectrophotometry 28 the lactic acid was determined by high performance liquid chromatography 29 the mobile phase was copper sulfate the column type was astec clc d 5 m 15 cm 4702 4 6 mm the flow rate was 1 ml min 1 the column temperature was 25 c the wavelength was 254 nm and the injection volume was 5 μl 3 results 3 1 the sludge acclimation and performance of the uasb reactor after the initial adaptation of the sludge inoculated the nh4 n and so4 2 s in the reactor began to be removed as shown in the fig 2 when the reactor running up to the 10th day the removal rate of nh4 n could reach 50 during this period the concentration of ammonia nitrogen in influent was continuously increased at the 37th day 80 nitrogen was removed of inflow ammonia with a concentration of 35 mg l and the reactor ran stable the removal of so4 2 s basically maintained to be steadily improved and the removal rate was made to reach above 50 when the inflow concentration was maintained above 30 mg l from the 27th day indicating that the sulfate reduction ammonia oxidation reaction was successfully started up considering that the sulfur was mainly used as an auxiliary ammonia nitrogen removal material the sulfate concentration was not raised too high the removal amount of so4 2 s was basically consistent with the production amount of s2 s it was judged that the removal of sulfate was mainly caused by the direct formation of sulfur ions through the sulfate reduction approach and the difference part was mainly caused by the formation of the fes and h2s gas with the ferrous ions the control experimental group without adding sulfate is shown in fig 3 the ammonia nitrogen in the influent is rapidly removed in the early stage of the reaction we increased the concentration of ammonia nitrogen in the influent water to 60 70 and 80 mg l on the 25th 35th and 60th day respectively in the end ammonia nitrogen concentration can be removed to 30 mg l the removal of ammonia nitrogen is not related to sulfate referring to the conclusion of batch type experiment an attempt was made to stop adding the sulfate into the inflow water in the uasb reactor the inflow ammonia nitrogen load was increased rapidly and the removal rate was maintained to be above 60 the concentration of inflow ammonia nitrogen in the reactor exceeds the 80 mg l at the highest and the removal rate of ammonia nitrogen was maintained to be above 70 since the addition of sulfate in the inflow water had been completely stopped no fes were generated in the reactor the original fes was gradually discharged with the effluent of the reactor and the sludge color in the reactor was gradually changed from inkiness to the yellow and black as shown in the fig 4 3 2 the synchronous denitrification and sulfur removal experiment simulated by the batch type reaction as shown in fig 5 the reaction was conducted within 1 5 h ammonia and total nitrogen concentration decreased synchronized respectively removed 56 92 mg l and 49 1 mg l the removal rate of ammonia nitrogen reached the maximum while the contents of the sulfate and sulfide remained to be basically unchanged in the stage of 6 10 h the removal rate of ammonia nitrogen and total nitrogen gradually slowed down respectively removing 10 5 mg l and 15 36 mg l and almost no removal in 8 10 h indicating that the removal of ammonia nitrogen was basically over and at the same time both the removal of sulfate and the generation of sulfide have been significantly increased which were 6 86 mg l and 5 86 mg l respectively comparing the data of 10th h and 24th h again it could be found that the removal of ammonia nitrogen and total nitrogen was almost unchanged which proved that the denitrification reaction had stopped while the removal of sulfate and the formation of sulfides were still going on this showed that the desulfurization reaction proceeded independently of the denitrification reaction the above figure a had shown the change relationships of the ammonia nitrogen total nitrogen and glucose during the batch type reaction period the batch type experiment was conducted by adding 7000 mg l glucose and 85 mg l ammonia nitrogen with the gradual hydrolysis and fermentation of glucose in the solution the contents of the ammonia nitrogen and total nitrogen were also decreased at the same time in the 7th to 8th hours glucose was almost completely hydrolyzed while the removal rate of ammonia nitrogen and total nitrogen also gradually decreased as was shown in the figure b the denitrification reaction continued when 700 mg l of glucose was added again to continue the reaction the rate of denitrification reaction was also slowed down correspondingly when the glucose content was reduced the changes of various vfas in the entire denitrification and desulfurization process were shown in fig 6 a where the ethanol content was extremely low and close to 0 there were two possibilities namely less production after hydrolysis or faster utilization the changes of butyric acid and lactic acid accumulated first and then decreased indicating that butyric acid and lactic acid were utilized in the reaction and the content of propionic acid acetic acid showed a tendency to accumulate so the dosage in the reaction was almost not large by comparing the change of vfa in the only adding the ammonia nitrogen without adding the sulfate experimental group in the water distribution in the fig 6 b and the only adding the sulfate without adding the ammonia nitrogen experimental group in the water distribution in the fig 6 c it could be found that both butyric acid and lactic acid in the two experimental groups exhibited a cumulative consumption process indicating that both butyric acid and lactic acid were used when the denitrification reaction and sulfate reduction reaction were carried out separately and ammonia nitrogen was added at the same time in the case of sulphate and ammonia ammonia nitrogen and sulphate show obvious sequential removal it showed that there was a competitive relationship for the utilization of butyric acid and lactic acid and the competitiveness of sulfate reducing bacteria is weak 3 3 the effect of adding fe3 into the anaerobic ferric ammonia oxidation as shown in the fig 7 after dosing 40 mg l fe3 in the feed water for experiments it could be seen that 68 82 mg l of ammonia nitrogen was removed within 8 h and the removal of ammonia nitrogen was almost linearly reduced compared the 8th h 12th h and 24th h ammonia nitrogen detection results the end point of the reaction should be between 8 and 12 h compared with the typical ammonia nitrogen removal situation it could be seen that when more fe3 was directly added the ammonia nitrogen removal situation in the reactor had been significantly improved during the 8 h reaction the content of iron ions showed an obvious downward trend while the content of ferrous ions gradually increased calculating the relationship between fe2 fe3 and tfe it was found that the total iron content was basically in 1 8 h stable at about 45 mg l it could be considered that the total iron content in the solution was basically unchanged and close to the dosage therefore it was believed that fe3 was reduced to fe2 in the reaction the ph reached 8 3 at the beginning of the reaction due to the addition of sodium bicarbonate then gradually decreased to 6 01 with the hydrolysis of glucose then began to rise and stabilized at about 7 4 at the end of the reaction 3 4 experiment of domestic sewage fed fig 8 shows the reaction condition for the addition of the acclimated sludge and glucose in the sewage water of primary sedimentation tank at a sewage plant it can be seen that the ammonia nitrogen in the experimental group of glucose addition in the 6 h was almost completely removed while the ammonia nitrogen in the control group was not almost removed it had shown that the reaction could be applied to the ammonia nitrogen removal in the domestic sewage but the carbon source needed to be added and the ethanol in the raw water had no effect on the denitrification reaction referring to the results of the batch type experiment the ethanol acetic acid propionic acid butyric acid lactic acid and glucose were added respectively the removal of ammonia nitrogen is shown in table 2 in the ethanol acetic acid and propionic acid addition group all the removed amounts of ammonia nitrogen were about 1 mg l and were not almost removed it had indicated that these three substances had little help for the denitrification reaction it had also indicated that the lower content of ethanol measured in the batch type experiment was mainly due to the small production amount rather than the high use amount the removal amount of the butyric acid and lactic acid two group was 11 3 mg l and 12 79 mg l respectively which was much higher than that of the ethanol acetic acid and propionic acid three group and was lower than the 17 78 mg l of glucose addition group at the same time the experiment had also shown that the ammonia nitrogen in the domestic sewage could be removed by the reaction after adding the proper amount of sludge and the appropriate carbon source 4 discussions it is generally believed that the general reaction formula of sulfate anaerobic ammoxidation is as follows 18 1 so 4 2 2nh 4 s n 2 4h 2 o rgm 45 35 kj mol 1 that is the sulfate is reduced to sulfur and the ammonia nitrogen is oxidized to nitrogen however some studies confirm that sulfate type anammox firstly oxidizes ammonia nitrogen to nitrite nitrogen by sulfate reduction reaction and then removes nitrogen by nitrite type anammox reaction 29 although denitrification and sulfate reduction did occur in the reactor fig 5 ammonia nitrogen and sulfate was removed obvious sequentially in time and the desulfurization reaction was still going on after the denitrification reaction finished so it was inferred the react occurred in the reactor was not sulfate anaerobic ammonia oxidation yang 30 confirmed that the coupling reaction of iron anammox may occur in anaerobic environment and the reaction formula are as follows eqs 2 4 the oxidation products of ammonia include n2 nitrous acid and nitric acid 2 3fe oh 3 5h nh 4 3fe 2 9h 2 o 0 5 n 2 r g m 245 kj mol 1 3 6fe oh 3 10 h nh 4 6fe 2 16 h 2 o no 2 r g m 164 kj mol 1 4 8fe oh 3 14 h nh 4 8fe 2 21 h 2 o no 3 r g m 207 kj mol 1 in the batch experiment with fe3 the concentration of ammonia nitrogen and total nitrogen decreased together indicating that ammonia nitrogen was removed with the decrease of the concentration of fe3 concentration and the increase of the concentration of fe2 the total content of fe in serum bottle remained basically unchanged indicating the change of iron in serum vials was mainly in valence state therefore the experimental results are consistent with the results of anaerobic iron ammoxidation eq 2 in addition very low content of nitrite and the highest generated no3 n of 2 87 mg l were detected in the reaction which is consistent with formula 4 therefore the possible coupling reaction between sulfate reduction and anaerobic iron ammonium oxidation in the reactor can not be ruled out current research results have proved that the anaerobic ferric ammonium oxidation reaction is autotrophic 31 i e the reaction does not require organic matter some studies have shown that the existence of organic matter is detrimental to the growth and metabolism of anaerobic iron ammonia oxidizing bacteria 32 when the inorganic carbon concentration increased from 0 2 to 1 2 mmol l 1 the fe2 concentration in the product had increased 33 but in this experiment we have tried to conduct experiments without adding organic carbon source and found that the added ammonia nitrogen was not significantly removed on the contrary anaerobic ferric ammonium oxidation reaction not only required a high organic carbon source in the environment but also suitable carbon sources in the reactor such as glucose butyric acid and lactic acid if there was ethanol acetic acid or propionic acid the reaction did not occur which are different with that of the autotrophic anaerobic ferric ammonium oxidation reaction 34 it seems reasonable there is a correlation between sulfate reduction and anaerobic ferric ammoxidation in the reactor different from sulfur driven iron reduction coupled to anaerobic ammonium oxidation 35 or sulfate dependent anaerobic ammonium oxidation s anammox process 36 we believe that the sulfide produced by the sulfate reduction was not used for the phenomenon of iron ammoxidation in our study with accounting for the relationship between sulfate reduction and sulfide formation therefore the relationship between them needs to be further confirmed it is generally believed the factors affecting the anaerobic iron ammonia oxidation reaction are mainly ph total iron total nitrogen total organic carbon dissolved organic carbon etc 37 39 however many experiments aimed at anaerobic ferric ammonium oxidation research are mostly conducted by directly extracting sludge with anaerobic ferric ammonium oxidation phenomenon from the natural environment such as intertidal zone 40 paddy 39 forest wetland 33 etc in the process of cultivation it is mainly to simulate the natural environment the sludge used in our experiment was taken from the anaerobic reactor of the brewery and domesticated in a special environment with high cod and sulfate therefore the conditions required for the anaerobic iron ammonium oxidation reaction produced by domestication in the reactor may be different from the natural environment synchronization of the two reactions was observed in the uasb reactor but a clear sequence of reactions denitrification followed by desulfurization was shown in the serum bottle test it is known that the corresponding microorganisms in the two reactions all need butyric acid and lactic acid but the different reaction conditions led to the different use of substrates and environment 41 under the condition of complete mixing it is difficult for sulfate reducing bacteria to obtain butyric acid and lactic acid in competition therefore only when the denitrification reaction ends sulfate reducing bacteria have the opportunity to obtain lactic acid and its reduction reaction speed gradually increases in the uasb reactor with continuous flow orp decreased gradually from top to bottom 102 4 mv in the top layer and 404 2 mv in the bottom layer near the inlet which was more conducive to the growth of sulfate reducing bacteria 42 after uasb was started a phenomenon was noticed that ammonia nitrogen load could not be significantly increased the reason should be that the sulfate reduction reaction consumed part of butyric acid and lactic acid produced by fermentation and a large amount of sulfur ions produced inhibited the denitrification reaction to some extent 43 therefore after stopping adding sulfate the ammonia nitrogen load and removal efficiency of uasb reactor were obviously improved therefore denitrification and desulfurization are two independent but interactive processes in the reactor and the connection point is the utilization of carbon source from the thermodynamic point of view ph has great influence on anaerobic iron ammoxidation 7 30 44 when ph 6 the gibbs free energy g of iron ammonia oxidation is greater than zero and the reaction cannot proceed it can be seen from the ph change in the batch experiment of adding fe3 that the lowest point of the ph change measured in the reaction is 5 78 but the ph is still higher than 6 most of the time in addition the ph of the uasb reactor was controlled at about 7 5 and the anaerobic iron ammonia oxidation was still going on through comprehensive analysis of the conditions i e carbon source and fe3 that affect the denitrification process it can be inferred that the denitrification reaction in the reactor is an anaerobic iron ammoxidation reaction that needs to be carried out through the interaction of microorganisms in the presence of carbon source butyric acid lactic acid etc but how to carry out specific cooperation among microorganisms remains to be studied in the future although there was a certain amount of ferrous iron 6 mg l in the inlet some fe2 was oxidized due to factors such as dissolved oxygen in the water the results are shown in table 3 therefore fe3 will be found after entering the reactor and thus participate in the anaerobic iron ammoxidation reaction in the reactor according to the above formula fe3 in inlet does not match fe consumed by ammonia oxidation croal found that there are certain anaerobic iron oxidizing bacteria in anaerobic environment 45 which can oxidize fe2 to fe3 as shown in the reaction equation 5 hco 3 4fe 2 10 h 2 o ch 2 o 4fe oh 3 7h through this reaction fe2 produced by anaerobic iron ammoxidation will be oxidized to fe3 and the metabolic energy needed to maintain physiological activities will be obtained from this process this constitutes an anaerobic cycle of iron which leads to continuous oxidation of ammonia nitrogen that means only a little of iron ion existed in influent will enough for oxidation of ammonium 5 conclusions in human life and production wastewater containing a large amount of ammonia will inevitably be produced the removal of ammonia is extremely important but also consumes a large amount of energy and time in wastewater treatment the original intention of sulfate type anammox reaction is using sulfate to remove ammonia nitrogen in wastewater so as to achieve the purpose of high efficiency and energy saving the srao reaction was successfully achieved in our laboratory experiments in a uasb reactor but analyzing the experimental process we found that this pathway is different from sulfate type anammox reaction therefore we analyzed and studied the process of this reaction and it was tried whether the reaction can be applied to domestic sewage treatment the specific conclusions are as follows 1 after operation of 60 days in the uasb reactor the sulfate reduction ammonia oxidation reaction has been successfully realized when the hrt of the reactor is the 4 h the ph is 7 0 0 2 and the inflow water cod load ammonia nitrogen load and sulfate load are the 2000 mg l 35 mg l and 128 mg l respectively the removal rates of the ammonia nitrogen and sulfate could reach above the 80 and 70 respectively 2 in the batch type reaction after the ammonia nitrogen or sulfate is added respectively and separately all the denitrification or desulfurization effect can be realized while the water distribution cod load ammonia nitrogen load and so4 2 s load are the 4000 mg l 100 mg l and 40 mg l respectively the removal rate of the ammonia nitrogen and sulfate at the 8 h of reaction is the 70 and 20 and then the denitrification reaction stops the desulfurization reaction continues the stopping of the sulfate addition is conducive to improving the efficiency of denitrification reaction after stopping the addition of sulfate in the reactor the ammonia nitrogen load of the inflow water can be rapidly increased up to the 70 mg l and the removal rate of ammonia nitrogen is maintained to be above the 70 3 the aosr reactions that occur in the reactor are sulfate reduction reactions and anaerobic ferric ammonia oxidation reactions the two reactions independently complete desulfurization and denitrification the anaerobic iron ammoxidation reaction realizes the ammoxidation reaction with nh4 and fe3 as electron donors and acceptors respectively in an environment where a high concentration of organic carbon source is added the organic carbon sources that promote the reaction are glucose butyric acid and lactic acid 4 the removal way of ammonia nitrogen in the reaction is the anaerobic iron ammonia oxidation reaction the reaction can be applied to removing the ammonia nitrogen in the actual domestic sewage but the addition of the additional carbon source is needed among them the addition of the glucose lactic acid and butyric acid has an obvious effect of denitrification when the ammonia nitrogen content in the domestic sewage is the 48 9 50 1 mg l the ammonia nitrogen in the domestic sewage can be completely removed within 6 h at present there are few studies on the cultured iron ammonia oxidation in the laboratory moreover the environmental conditions we used in the laboratory are relatively harsh and were not conducive for practical applications therefore the main goal of our experiments in the future is finding out the suitable culture conditions for the anaerobic iron ammonium oxidation reaction on this basis the goal of stable cultivation and practical application can be achieved declaration of competing interest

university of architecture and technology no 13 yanta road xi an shanxi china ammonia nitrogen removal with the aid of sulfate in sewage itself under anaerobic condition is thought to bring a great advantage for domestic wastewater treatment but how to achieve it is yet to be fully understood ammonia oxidation in high strong chemical oxygen demand cod condition in a upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor was studied and the valence state change of iron ion during the ammonia oxidation and sulfate reduction aosr were investigated in this study the experimental results show that aosr reaction was successfully realized in the uasb within the removal rates of ammonia nitrogen and sulfate were above 80 and 70 respectively the experiments of adding ammonia nitrogen or sulfate independently have proved that the denitrification and desulfurization reactions can be carried out independently in the batch test adding 40 mg l iron ion significantly improved the efficiency of ammonia removal and noted the production of ferrous ion in the test the total amount of iron ions almost did not change so it was judged that ammonia was removed by anaerobic iron ammonia oxidation in addition the reaction also occurred in organic wastewaters with different carbon source and the effect of glucose was the most obvious this study shows that in high cod environment ammonium oxidation and iron reduction can take place at the same time rather than sulfate reduction and ferrous ion is oxidized to ferric ion and sulfate reduction at the same time which indicates that it might be used to remove ammonia from domestic sewage keywords ammonia oxidation sulfate reduction ammonia oxidation carbon source feammox wastewater data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nitrogen compound pollution is one of the main concerns threatening clean water production for during the anthropocene 1 nitrates and nitrites in drinking water can carry cancer risks 2 and ammonia can cause eutrophication of water bodies 3 nitrous oxide is a strong greenhouse gas 4 which is mainly generated in the nitrification and denitrification reactions in the denitrification process of sewage 5 therefore it is necessary to remove nitrogen compounds efficiently variety of effective treatment processes have been developed such as simultaneous nitrification and denitrification 6 anaerobic ammonia oxidation 7 denitrifying ammonium oxidation deamox 8 however nitrification in wastewater treatment will consume a lot of energy and denitrification can only be achieved with sufficient organic carbon source 6 these disadvantages usually limit the biological removal of nitrogen in wastewater in practice in anaerobic environment it has been found that anammox bacteria can use ammonia as electron donor and nitrite as electron acceptor to remove nitrogen from wastewater 9 however due to the lack of nitrite in the raw wastewater it is necessary to add nitrite or oxidize part of ammonium to nitrite to participate in the reaction 7 this not only increases operating costs but also reduces efficiency 10 denitrifying ammonium oxidation is based on anaerobic ammonium oxidation simultaneously coupled with short range denitrification it makes the whole denitrification process easier and more stable but it still has the problem of long process and high cost 11 12 at the same time the operation of sewage treatment facilities is also an important part of sewage treatment large amount of energy saving in addition to improved effluent quality could be achieved through operational changes for example during the operation of the denitrification process the relationship between the reduction of ammonia nitrogen and the increase of nitrogen oxides can be balanced by setting the srt reasonably so as to achieve the goal of efficient and energy saving operation of the sewage treatment plant 13 the treatment efficiency of sewage treatment facilities is also affected by weather the impact load of cod and ammonia nitrogen in the influent of sewage treatment facilities will increase due to the dilution effect in wet weather 14 some sewage treatment facilities have achieved energy autarky by adopting nitritation anammox process to increase hrt of the primary clarifier to improve biogas production and reduce aeration energy for bod removal and nitrification 15 ammonia is one of the most important pollutants in wastewater treatment and ammonia removal affects the efficiency economy and reuse of the entire wastewater treatment process therefore an efficient and economical ammonia removal process is very necessary in recent years it has been found that another anammox pathway may exist in the natural environment sulfate anammox that is sulfate is used as an electron acceptor to oxidize ammonia nitrogen to nitrogen 16 18 domestic sewage usually contains a certain amount of sulfate therefore because of its low harm it is usually not treated in the sewage treatment plant if this part of sulfate can be used to remove ammonia nitrogen compared with nitrite reducting anammox reaction the nitrogen removal process will be more simply and the use of pollutants in wastewater will be more thorough which will have a good prospect in the efficiency and economy of wastewater treatment due to the discovery of sulfate reducing anammox reaction and the derivation of general reaction equation from thermodynamics 16 there is no consensus on its specific realization path and reaction mechanism some studies have attempted to initiate sulfate reducing anammox in autotrophic environment 19 there is also case of startup of it in heterotrophic environments 20 21 some researchers believe that the reaction is caused by anaerobic sulfate reducing reaction 22 ammonia oxidizing bacteria are independent in which denitrification and desulfurization are carried out simultaneously some researchers have also found that the reaction was a mixed action of multi bacteria in which sulfate first oxidized ammonia nitrogen to nitrite and then denitrified it by anammox 23 however in anaerobic environment there is still no reliable evidence whether microorganisms can use sulfate to oxidize ammonia generally speaking in anaerobic environment denitrifying bacteria will use organic matter and nitrate for denitrification reaction 24 if sulfate is also present special sulfate reducing bacteria use organic matter mainly organic acids such as lactic acid to reduce sulfate to sulfide ions in a highly anaerobic and reducing environment 25 although it is not normal there are few reports on anaerobic sulfate reducing bacteria in anaerobic environment with organic substance exist and there is still a lack of in depth study on the biotransformation of ammonia and sulfate in our previous experiment of hydrogen production by anaerobic fermentation of organic matter the removal of ammonia and the reduction of sulfate were found 26 it was speculated that the reaction should be sulfate type anammox based on this we try to establish an aosr reaction system that can be quickly started and run efficiently in the laboratory in this study the transformation processes of nitrogen and sulfur were analyzed separately and the possible relationships among them were analyzed and a possible mechanistic explanation for that anaerobic iron ammonia oxidation reaction and sulfate reduction reaction jointly complete the aosr process was proposed 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge acclimation and simulation experiment a uasb reactor was used to perform the simulation experiment as shown in the fig 1 the uasb reactor was a column of 90 cm in height 16 cm in diameter and an effective volume of 5 l the daily inflow was 12 l and the hrt 10 h the reactor temperature was controlled at 38 1 c the biogas generated in the reactor was discharged through the air outlet and its volume was measured by a wet gas flow meter the sludge inoculated in the reactor was obtained from the flocculent sludge from the anaerobic methane fermentation uasb of a brewery in xi an city china after the inoculation the sludge concentration in the reactor was controlled at about 12 000 mg l the synthetic wastewater distribution was used for the experiment the glucose ammonium chloride and anhydrous sodium sulfate were used as the carbon nitrogen and sulfur sources when the reactor started the cod was the 2000 mg l nh4 n 10 mg l so4 2 s 10 mg l and fe2 3 mg l a certain amount of the sodium bicarbonate and potassium dihydrogen phosphate determined according to the ph of the outlet water were added into the water distribution to maintain the ph of 7 2 0 5 in the reactor the ph of the wastewater was adjusted to about 7 5 2 2 batch experiment a 200 ml serum bottle was used for batch experiment before the experiment a corresponding numbers of serum bottles were prepared according to the experimental design and the parallel samples were prepared respectively the sludge which acclimated successfully in the uasb reactor was applied by the sludge in the bottle after the sludge was centrifuged in a centrifuge at the 4000 r min for 5 min and then the same weight was weighed respectively and added to the serum bottle among them the sewage configuration mode of conventional reaction was cod 6000 mg l nh4 n 100 mg l so4 2 s 40 mg l fe2 5 mg l potassium dihydrogen phosphate 500 mg l sodium bicarbonate appropriate amount adjusting the solution ph to 7 5 and the other trace elements another batch experiment was conducted on the sewage of the primary sedimentation tank of the 4th xi an municipal wastewater treatment plant the water quality is as shown in the table 1 2 3 analysis method nh4 n salicylic acid hypochlorite salt spectrophotometry so4 2 s barium chromate photometric method s2 s p aminodimethylaniline photometric method cod potassium dichromate method tn potassium persulfate digestion method ph glass electrode method the vfa was determined by the gas chromatography the column type was db waxetr determination conditions the sample was started to run at 80 c then heated to 100 c at the rate of 20 c min 1 then heated to 180 c at the rate of 10 c min 1 and finally rapidly rose to 220 c at the rate of 30 c min 1 each injection quantity was 0 5 μl the ferric and ferrous ions were determined by the phenanthroline spectrophotometry 28 the lactic acid was determined by high performance liquid chromatography 29 the mobile phase was copper sulfate the column type was astec clc d 5 m 15 cm 4702 4 6 mm the flow rate was 1 ml min 1 the column temperature was 25 c the wavelength was 254 nm and the injection volume was 5 μl 3 results 3 1 the sludge acclimation and performance of the uasb reactor after the initial adaptation of the sludge inoculated the nh4 n and so4 2 s in the reactor began to be removed as shown in the fig 2 when the reactor running up to the 10th day the removal rate of nh4 n could reach 50 during this period the concentration of ammonia nitrogen in influent was continuously increased at the 37th day 80 nitrogen was removed of inflow ammonia with a concentration of 35 mg l and the reactor ran stable the removal of so4 2 s basically maintained to be steadily improved and the removal rate was made to reach above 50 when the inflow concentration was maintained above 30 mg l from the 27th day indicating that the sulfate reduction ammonia oxidation reaction was successfully started up considering that the sulfur was mainly used as an auxiliary ammonia nitrogen removal material the sulfate concentration was not raised too high the removal amount of so4 2 s was basically consistent with the production amount of s2 s it was judged that the removal of sulfate was mainly caused by the direct formation of sulfur ions through the sulfate reduction approach and the difference part was mainly caused by the formation of the fes and h2s gas with the ferrous ions the control experimental group without adding sulfate is shown in fig 3 the ammonia nitrogen in the influent is rapidly removed in the early stage of the reaction we increased the concentration of ammonia nitrogen in the influent water to 60 70 and 80 mg l on the 25th 35th and 60th day respectively in the end ammonia nitrogen concentration can be removed to 30 mg l the removal of ammonia nitrogen is not related to sulfate referring to the conclusion of batch type experiment an attempt was made to stop adding the sulfate into the inflow water in the uasb reactor the inflow ammonia nitrogen load was increased rapidly and the removal rate was maintained to be above 60 the concentration of inflow ammonia nitrogen in the reactor exceeds the 80 mg l at the highest and the removal rate of ammonia nitrogen was maintained to be above 70 since the addition of sulfate in the inflow water had been completely stopped no fes were generated in the reactor the original fes was gradually discharged with the effluent of the reactor and the sludge color in the reactor was gradually changed from inkiness to the yellow and black as shown in the fig 4 3 2 the synchronous denitrification and sulfur removal experiment simulated by the batch type reaction as shown in fig 5 the reaction was conducted within 1 5 h ammonia and total nitrogen concentration decreased synchronized respectively removed 56 92 mg l and 49 1 mg l the removal rate of ammonia nitrogen reached the maximum while the contents of the sulfate and sulfide remained to be basically unchanged in the stage of 6 10 h the removal rate of ammonia nitrogen and total nitrogen gradually slowed down respectively removing 10 5 mg l and 15 36 mg l and almost no removal in 8 10 h indicating that the removal of ammonia nitrogen was basically over and at the same time both the removal of sulfate and the generation of sulfide have been significantly increased which were 6 86 mg l and 5 86 mg l respectively comparing the data of 10th h and 24th h again it could be found that the removal of ammonia nitrogen and total nitrogen was almost unchanged which proved that the denitrification reaction had stopped while the removal of sulfate and the formation of sulfides were still going on this showed that the desulfurization reaction proceeded independently of the denitrification reaction the above figure a had shown the change relationships of the ammonia nitrogen total nitrogen and glucose during the batch type reaction period the batch type experiment was conducted by adding 7000 mg l glucose and 85 mg l ammonia nitrogen with the gradual hydrolysis and fermentation of glucose in the solution the contents of the ammonia nitrogen and total nitrogen were also decreased at the same time in the 7th to 8th hours glucose was almost completely hydrolyzed while the removal rate of ammonia nitrogen and total nitrogen also gradually decreased as was shown in the figure b the denitrification reaction continued when 700 mg l of glucose was added again to continue the reaction the rate of denitrification reaction was also slowed down correspondingly when the glucose content was reduced the changes of various vfas in the entire denitrification and desulfurization process were shown in fig 6 a where the ethanol content was extremely low and close to 0 there were two possibilities namely less production after hydrolysis or faster utilization the changes of butyric acid and lactic acid accumulated first and then decreased indicating that butyric acid and lactic acid were utilized in the reaction and the content of propionic acid acetic acid showed a tendency to accumulate so the dosage in the reaction was almost not large by comparing the change of vfa in the only adding the ammonia nitrogen without adding the sulfate experimental group in the water distribution in the fig 6 b and the only adding the sulfate without adding the ammonia nitrogen experimental group in the water distribution in the fig 6 c it could be found that both butyric acid and lactic acid in the two experimental groups exhibited a cumulative consumption process indicating that both butyric acid and lactic acid were used when the denitrification reaction and sulfate reduction reaction were carried out separately and ammonia nitrogen was added at the same time in the case of sulphate and ammonia ammonia nitrogen and sulphate show obvious sequential removal it showed that there was a competitive relationship for the utilization of butyric acid and lactic acid and the competitiveness of sulfate reducing bacteria is weak 3 3 the effect of adding fe3 into the anaerobic ferric ammonia oxidation as shown in the fig 7 after dosing 40 mg l fe3 in the feed water for experiments it could be seen that 68 82 mg l of ammonia nitrogen was removed within 8 h and the removal of ammonia nitrogen was almost linearly reduced compared the 8th h 12th h and 24th h ammonia nitrogen detection results the end point of the reaction should be between 8 and 12 h compared with the typical ammonia nitrogen removal situation it could be seen that when more fe3 was directly added the ammonia nitrogen removal situation in the reactor had been significantly improved during the 8 h reaction the content of iron ions showed an obvious downward trend while the content of ferrous ions gradually increased calculating the relationship between fe2 fe3 and tfe it was found that the total iron content was basically in 1 8 h stable at about 45 mg l it could be considered that the total iron content in the solution was basically unchanged and close to the dosage therefore it was believed that fe3 was reduced to fe2 in the reaction the ph reached 8 3 at the beginning of the reaction due to the addition of sodium bicarbonate then gradually decreased to 6 01 with the hydrolysis of glucose then began to rise and stabilized at about 7 4 at the end of the reaction 3 4 experiment of domestic sewage fed fig 8 shows the reaction condition for the addition of the acclimated sludge and glucose in the sewage water of primary sedimentation tank at a sewage plant it can be seen that the ammonia nitrogen in the experimental group of glucose addition in the 6 h was almost completely removed while the ammonia nitrogen in the control group was not almost removed it had shown that the reaction could be applied to the ammonia nitrogen removal in the domestic sewage but the carbon source needed to be added and the ethanol in the raw water had no effect on the denitrification reaction referring to the results of the batch type experiment the ethanol acetic acid propionic acid butyric acid lactic acid and glucose were added respectively the removal of ammonia nitrogen is shown in table 2 in the ethanol acetic acid and propionic acid addition group all the removed amounts of ammonia nitrogen were about 1 mg l and were not almost removed it had indicated that these three substances had little help for the denitrification reaction it had also indicated that the lower content of ethanol measured in the batch type experiment was mainly due to the small production amount rather than the high use amount the removal amount of the butyric acid and lactic acid two group was 11 3 mg l and 12 79 mg l respectively which was much higher than that of the ethanol acetic acid and propionic acid three group and was lower than the 17 78 mg l of glucose addition group at the same time the experiment had also shown that the ammonia nitrogen in the domestic sewage could be removed by the reaction after adding the proper amount of sludge and the appropriate carbon source 4 discussions it is generally believed that the general reaction formula of sulfate anaerobic ammoxidation is as follows 18 1 so 4 2 2nh 4 s n 2 4h 2 o rgm 45 35 kj mol 1 that is the sulfate is reduced to sulfur and the ammonia nitrogen is oxidized to nitrogen however some studies confirm that sulfate type anammox firstly oxidizes ammonia nitrogen to nitrite nitrogen by sulfate reduction reaction and then removes nitrogen by nitrite type anammox reaction 29 although denitrification and sulfate reduction did occur in the reactor fig 5 ammonia nitrogen and sulfate was removed obvious sequentially in time and the desulfurization reaction was still going on after the denitrification reaction finished so it was inferred the react occurred in the reactor was not sulfate anaerobic ammonia oxidation yang 30 confirmed that the coupling reaction of iron anammox may occur in anaerobic environment and the reaction formula are as follows eqs 2 4 the oxidation products of ammonia include n2 nitrous acid and nitric acid 2 3fe oh 3 5h nh 4 3fe 2 9h 2 o 0 5 n 2 r g m 245 kj mol 1 3 6fe oh 3 10 h nh 4 6fe 2 16 h 2 o no 2 r g m 164 kj mol 1 4 8fe oh 3 14 h nh 4 8fe 2 21 h 2 o no 3 r g m 207 kj mol 1 in the batch experiment with fe3 the concentration of ammonia nitrogen and total nitrogen decreased together indicating that ammonia nitrogen was removed with the decrease of the concentration of fe3 concentration and the increase of the concentration of fe2 the total content of fe in serum bottle remained basically unchanged indicating the change of iron in serum vials was mainly in valence state therefore the experimental results are consistent with the results of anaerobic iron ammoxidation eq 2 in addition very low content of nitrite and the highest generated no3 n of 2 87 mg l were detected in the reaction which is consistent with formula 4 therefore the possible coupling reaction between sulfate reduction and anaerobic iron ammonium oxidation in the reactor can not be ruled out current research results have proved that the anaerobic ferric ammonium oxidation reaction is autotrophic 31 i e the reaction does not require organic matter some studies have shown that the existence of organic matter is detrimental to the growth and metabolism of anaerobic iron ammonia oxidizing bacteria 32 when the inorganic carbon concentration increased from 0 2 to 1 2 mmol l 1 the fe2 concentration in the product had increased 33 but in this experiment we have tried to conduct experiments without adding organic carbon source and found that the added ammonia nitrogen was not significantly removed on the contrary anaerobic ferric ammonium oxidation reaction not only required a high organic carbon source in the environment but also suitable carbon sources in the reactor such as glucose butyric acid and lactic acid if there was ethanol acetic acid or propionic acid the reaction did not occur which are different with that of the autotrophic anaerobic ferric ammonium oxidation reaction 34 it seems reasonable there is a correlation between sulfate reduction and anaerobic ferric ammoxidation in the reactor different from sulfur driven iron reduction coupled to anaerobic ammonium oxidation 35 or sulfate dependent anaerobic ammonium oxidation s anammox process 36 we believe that the sulfide produced by the sulfate reduction was not used for the phenomenon of iron ammoxidation in our study with accounting for the relationship between sulfate reduction and sulfide formation therefore the relationship between them needs to be further confirmed it is generally believed the factors affecting the anaerobic iron ammonia oxidation reaction are mainly ph total iron total nitrogen total organic carbon dissolved organic carbon etc 37 39 however many experiments aimed at anaerobic ferric ammonium oxidation research are mostly conducted by directly extracting sludge with anaerobic ferric ammonium oxidation phenomenon from the natural environment such as intertidal zone 40 paddy 39 forest wetland 33 etc in the process of cultivation it is mainly to simulate the natural environment the sludge used in our experiment was taken from the anaerobic reactor of the brewery and domesticated in a special environment with high cod and sulfate therefore the conditions required for the anaerobic iron ammonium oxidation reaction produced by domestication in the reactor may be different from the natural environment synchronization of the two reactions was observed in the uasb reactor but a clear sequence of reactions denitrification followed by desulfurization was shown in the serum bottle test it is known that the corresponding microorganisms in the two reactions all need butyric acid and lactic acid but the different reaction conditions led to the different use of substrates and environment 41 under the condition of complete mixing it is difficult for sulfate reducing bacteria to obtain butyric acid and lactic acid in competition therefore only when the denitrification reaction ends sulfate reducing bacteria have the opportunity to obtain lactic acid and its reduction reaction speed gradually increases in the uasb reactor with continuous flow orp decreased gradually from top to bottom 102 4 mv in the top layer and 404 2 mv in the bottom layer near the inlet which was more conducive to the growth of sulfate reducing bacteria 42 after uasb was started a phenomenon was noticed that ammonia nitrogen load could not be significantly increased the reason should be that the sulfate reduction reaction consumed part of butyric acid and lactic acid produced by fermentation and a large amount of sulfur ions produced inhibited the denitrification reaction to some extent 43 therefore after stopping adding sulfate the ammonia nitrogen load and removal efficiency of uasb reactor were obviously improved therefore denitrification and desulfurization are two independent but interactive processes in the reactor and the connection point is the utilization of carbon source from the thermodynamic point of view ph has great influence on anaerobic iron ammoxidation 7 30 44 when ph 6 the gibbs free energy g of iron ammonia oxidation is greater than zero and the reaction cannot proceed it can be seen from the ph change in the batch experiment of adding fe3 that the lowest point of the ph change measured in the reaction is 5 78 but the ph is still higher than 6 most of the time in addition the ph of the uasb reactor was controlled at about 7 5 and the anaerobic iron ammonia oxidation was still going on through comprehensive analysis of the conditions i e carbon source and fe3 that affect the denitrification process it can be inferred that the denitrification reaction in the reactor is an anaerobic iron ammoxidation reaction that needs to be carried out through the interaction of microorganisms in the presence of carbon source butyric acid lactic acid etc but how to carry out specific cooperation among microorganisms remains to be studied in the future although there was a certain amount of ferrous iron 6 mg l in the inlet some fe2 was oxidized due to factors such as dissolved oxygen in the water the results are shown in table 3 therefore fe3 will be found after entering the reactor and thus participate in the anaerobic iron ammoxidation reaction in the reactor according to the above formula fe3 in inlet does not match fe consumed by ammonia oxidation croal found that there are certain anaerobic iron oxidizing bacteria in anaerobic environment 45 which can oxidize fe2 to fe3 as shown in the reaction equation 5 hco 3 4fe 2 10 h 2 o ch 2 o 4fe oh 3 7h through this reaction fe2 produced by anaerobic iron ammoxidation will be oxidized to fe3 and the metabolic energy needed to maintain physiological activities will be obtained from this process this constitutes an anaerobic cycle of iron which leads to continuous oxidation of ammonia nitrogen that means only a little of iron ion existed in influent will enough for oxidation of ammonium 5 conclusions in human life and production wastewater containing a large amount of ammonia will inevitably be produced the removal of ammonia is extremely important but also consumes a large amount of energy and time in wastewater treatment the original intention of sulfate type anammox reaction is using sulfate to remove ammonia nitrogen in wastewater so as to achieve the purpose of high efficiency and energy saving the srao reaction was successfully achieved in our laboratory experiments in a uasb reactor but analyzing the experimental process we found that this pathway is different from sulfate type anammox reaction therefore we analyzed and studied the process of this reaction and it was tried whether the reaction can be applied to domestic sewage treatment the specific conclusions are as follows 1 after operation of 60 days in the uasb reactor the sulfate reduction ammonia oxidation reaction has been successfully realized when the hrt of the reactor is the 4 h the ph is 7 0 0 2 and the inflow water cod load ammonia nitrogen load and sulfate load are the 2000 mg l 35 mg l and 128 mg l respectively the removal rates of the ammonia nitrogen and sulfate could reach above the 80 and 70 respectively 2 in the batch type reaction after the ammonia nitrogen or sulfate is added respectively and separately all the denitrification or desulfurization effect can be realized while the water distribution cod load ammonia nitrogen load and so4 2 s load are the 4000 mg l 100 mg l and 40 mg l respectively the removal rate of the ammonia nitrogen and sulfate at the 8 h of reaction is the 70 and 20 and then the denitrification reaction stops the desulfurization reaction continues the stopping of the sulfate addition is conducive to improving the efficiency of denitrification reaction after stopping the addition of sulfate in the reactor the ammonia nitrogen load of the inflow water can be rapidly increased up to the 70 mg l and the removal rate of ammonia nitrogen is maintained to be above the 70 3 the aosr reactions that occur in the reactor are sulfate reduction reactions and anaerobic ferric ammonia oxidation reactions the two reactions independently complete desulfurization and denitrification the anaerobic iron ammoxidation reaction realizes the ammoxidation reaction with nh4 and fe3 as electron donors and acceptors respectively in an environment where a high concentration of organic carbon source is added the organic carbon sources that promote the reaction are glucose butyric acid and lactic acid 4 the removal way of ammonia nitrogen in the reaction is the anaerobic iron ammonia oxidation reaction the reaction can be applied to removing the ammonia nitrogen in the actual domestic sewage but the addition of the additional carbon source is needed among them the addition of the glucose lactic acid and butyric acid has an obvious effect of denitrification when the ammonia nitrogen content in the domestic sewage is the 48 9 50 1 mg l the ammonia nitrogen in the domestic sewage can be completely removed within 6 h at present there are few studies on the cultured iron ammonia oxidation in the laboratory moreover the environmental conditions we used in the laboratory are relatively harsh and were not conducive for practical applications therefore the main goal of our experiments in the future is finding out the suitable culture conditions for the anaerobic iron ammonium oxidation reaction on this basis the goal of stable cultivation and practical application can be achieved declaration of competing interest

antibiotics in the livestock sewerage are responsible for antimicrobial resistance causing a global public health crisis and necessitating high efficient and environmental friendly antibiotic treatment processes herein one membrane pre concentration and mof based selective adsorption hybrid system is proposed to high efficiently remove tetracycline tc from the aqueous solution containing other two representative antibiotics sulfamethoxazole smz and trimethoprim tmp in the livestock sewage in this work two common mofs based materials mil 101 fe and nh2 mil 101 fe are employed as the adsorbents to selectively remove tc from the solution adsorption experiments showed that the selective coefficient of nh2 mil 101 fe for tc could reach up to 95 because of stronger interaction between tc and mil 101s calculated via the theoretical simulation also experimental results demonstrated that the desired operating conditions necessitated thermal input and pre concentration operation accordingly temperature enhanced forward osmosis t fo and temperature enhanced osmotic membrane distillation t omd were proposed to concentrate the solution containing these three antibiotics in the cost effective way where the fertilizer solution kcl in this work was used as the draw solution ds and diluted ds solution could be used in agricultural fertigation membrane pre concentration experiments showed that tc tmp and smz could be theoretically concentrated in t fo but high tc and kcl leakage and inevitable water flux decline behavior significantly sacrificed the concentration efficiency thereby initiating the application of t omd higher and more stable water flux occurred in t omd and 99 76 of antibiotic and kcl leakage could be mitigated compared to t fo thereby providing one option to high efficiently remove antibiotics in livestock sewerage and achieve agricultural fertigation graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords selective adsorption membrane concentration antibiotics hybrid system data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction antibiotics as antibacterial agents have been widely used to prevent diseases in animal husbandry the poultry industry and aquaculture 1 4 it is reported that the global consumption of antibiotics has reached up to 300 000 tons year and most of them are employed in the livestock industry 5 6 as a consequence the antibiotics in the environment mainly originate from livestock sewerage based on such situation china as the global dominant antibiotic and meat consumer has to confront an extremely high risk of antibiotic resistance from its misuse and overuse 7 8 potentially causing one million deaths year and cumulative economic losses of 20 trillion in 2050 also world health organization who describes antimicrobial resistance as a global public health crisis necessitating urgent action therefore high efficiently removing the antibiotics in the water is vital to achieving sustainable development for both antibiotic and livestock industries numerous technologies including electrochemical process 9 ultrasonic treatment 10 advanced oxidation 11 12 membrane filtration 13 and adsorption technique 14 had been introduced and further investigated to remove antibiotics in water compared with other technologies the adsorption has great potential to high efficiently and environmental friendly achieve antibiotic removal because of low cost simple operation excellent adaptability and no secondary pollution 15 17 to date activated carbon 18 clay minerals 19 humus 20 zeolite 21 graphene oxide 22 biochar 23 24 mxene based nanomaterials 25 and nano zero valent iron nzvi based materials 26 have been reported to remove various antibiotics from wastewaters by the adsorption based interaction mechanism among these conventional and emerging adsorbent materials metal organic frameworks mofs as one new kind of porous material with highly ordered crystal structure have also attracted extensive attention in antibiotic removal due to their unique adsorption performance from the characteristics of large specific surface area high and tunable porosity molecular level customizability abundant active functional sites and superior mechanical stability 27 33 compared with other mofs base materials mil 101 fe one of mofs with iron as the central metal and terephthalic acid as the organic ligand is endowed with low synthesis cost feasible preparation method and good chemical thermal stability in aqueous solution and exhibits excellent adsorption performance for antibiotics 34 37 furthermore tetracycline tc trimethoprim tmp and sulfamethoxazole smz as three broad spectrum antibiotics appearing as early as the 20th century are widely used and accounts for 20 of all antibiotics 38 39 numerous studies focused on using mil 101 fe to adsorb the tc in the water in detail dong et al 34 prepared mil 101 fe series materials via microwave assisted synthesis and used them to remove tc in water showing good adsorption performance that the adsorption capacity could reach 300 mg g besides wang et al 36 and li et al 37 compared the adsorption capacities of three fe based mofs mil 101 fe mil 100 fe and mil 53 fe on tc and their results reached the same conclusion that mil 101 fe had the best adsorption effect on tc under the same experimental conditions but for the removal of the other two antibiotics tmp and smz the first choice is not mofs based adsorbent but carbon based materials i e activated carbon and graphene because of stronger adsorption between these two antibiotics and carbon based materials 40 41 in this sense mofs based adsorbents can selectively remove tc from the water containing these three antibiotics furthermore the content of antibiotics in the water commonly ranges from ng l to μg l thus the direct adsorption process without the pre concentration stage is bound to cause a significant increase in the operational expenditure opex since the system has to treat a huge amount of wastewater compared to the trace antibiotics as such forward osmosis fo as one representative of the membrane pre concentration process is driven by the osmotic pressure difference between the low concentration feed solution fs and the high concentration draw solution ds across the membrane 11 42 based on such characteristics fo can be viewed as one low energy consumption membrane process without the regeneration of the ds and it has been widely applied in several fields such as the concentration for some temperature sensitive products 43 44 and agricultural fertigation 45 48 especially for agricultural fertigation fo has been intensively investigated as potentially affordable and sustainable water and fertilizer supply method in which fertilizer solutions were used as the ds to extract fresh water from some unconventional waters like seawater or high salinity wastewater and some low saline impaired waters accordingly the diluted fertilizer solution can be directly used and these unconventional saline water sources can be simultaneously recycled if the antibiotics containing livestock sewage is used as fs in the context of agricultural fertigation the antibiotics in the fs side can be further concentrated and the fertilizer ds solution can be diluted subsequent concentrated antibiotics wastewater enters the mofs based adsorption process potentially reducing the wastewater treatment load and enhancing adsorbent efficiency therefore the combination of fo and mofs based adsorption can achieve the high efficient removal of antibiotics from livestock sewerage and agricultural fertigation however to the best of our knowledge related studies have been rarely involved until now in this work the mofs based adsorption process was expected to achieve high efficient separation of tc from the livestock sewage including tc tmp and smz besides mil 101 fe its amine functionalized form nh2 mil 101 fe was selected as the antibiotic adsorbent since it can lead to strong affinity with target foulant through forming strong hydrogen bonding interaction mil 101 fe and nh2 mil 101 fe were synthesized and characterized by different characterization methods i e sem xrd zeta potential ft ir and pore analysis and their difference in possible adsorption mechanism was analyzed then the effects of adsorption conditions i e adsorption time adsorbent dosage initial antibiotic concentration and adsorption temperature on the adsorption performance between two mofs based adsorbents and three antibiotics were investigated to analyze the possible adsorption mechanism and provide some intrinsic evidence to explain why the membrane pre concentration stage was prerequisite in the context of antibiotic containing sewage wastewater treatment next kcl one representative fertilizer and tc smz tmp three representative antibiotics are used as the solutes of ds and fs in the fo process respectively the effects of operation conditions i e temperature difference fertilizer concentration and the antibiotic type and concentration on its perm selective performance water flux forward antibiotic flux and reverse k flux were evaluated to judge whether fo was one suitable membrane based pre concentration technology as another low energy membrane concentration process one temperature enhanced osmotic membrane distillation t omd was proposed as one alternative pathway to high efficiently concentrate the antibiotic containing wastewater and dilute the fertilizer solution based on experimental results and theoretical analyzes the membrane pre concentration and mofs based adsorption hybrid processes were introduced and detail described with the purpose of the selective and efficient removal of tc from the livestock sewage containing three representative antibiotics tc tmp and smz and simultaneous agricultural fertigation potentially achieving the seamless integration between agriculture and husbandry 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and reagents the reagents contain ferric chloride hexahydrate fecl3 6h2o 99 purified terephthalic acid h2bdc 99 2

south korea and the flat sheet polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe hydrophobic membranes were friendly supplied by shengju environmental science and technology company limited hangzhou zhejiang china and the nominal pore size and thickness of the ptfe membrane are 1 and 40 μm 2 2 synthesis and characterization of mofs based adsorbents mil 101 fe and nh2 mil 101 fe were prepared via the hydrothermal synthesis method in previously reported studies 49 in detail 0 107 g fecl3 6h2o and 0 658 g h2bdc were dissolved in 90 ml dmf then 3 6 ml acetic acid was added to the solution fully stirred and transferred into the high temperature reaction kettle 100 ml in a drying oven kept at 110 c for 24 h after cooling to the ambient temperature the solution was centrifuged and the precipitate was recovered by washing the precipitation several times with anhydrous ethanol and dmf and further filtration pure precipitation was obtained finally the product was put into a vacuum drying oven and dried at 60 c for 24 h to remove the solvent molecules and metal ions in the mofs hole also nh2 mil 101 fe was prepared by the same method except that h2bdc was replaced by h2bdc nh2 in detail 1 914 g fecl3 6h2o and 0 512 g h2bdc nh2 were mixed and deliquescent by 60 ml dmf and 3 ml ethanoic acid subsequently other reaction conditions and procedures were the same as the ones for mil 101 fe then

specific surface area and porosity analyzer micromeritics usa 2 3 evaluation methods for the adsorption selectivity performance of mofs tc smz and tmp in an aqueous solution were adsorbed by mil 101 fe and nh2 mil 101 fe respectively tc or smz or tmp in an aqueous solution 100 mg l was prepared for subsequent experiments the working curve was obtained by using a uv vis spectrophotometer cary 60 agilent usa 5 mg of metal organic framework materials were dispersed in 50 ml pre prepared antibiotic solution and adsorbed in an oscillating chamber under certain conditions 25 c 200 rpm for a while 0 5 24 h the supernatant was purified by centrifugation and filtrated with a syringe filter polytetrafluoroethylene 0 5 μm the antibiotic concentration can be determined by the aforementioned working curve accordingly the adsorption capacity q can be obtained by the following equation 1 q c 0 c t v m in this equation c 0 c t represents the mass concentration of antibiotics at the initial time or t respectively v is the volume of the solution 50 ml and m is the mass of the adsorbent accordingly the average adsorption rate can be expressed by 2 r t m c q t m c t where t m and c in the subscript represent the adsorption time the adsorbent dosage and the initial concentration of antibiotics to configure the optimal dosage of mofs based adsorbent for high efficient removal of antibiotics the variation of the average adsorption rate induced by the adsorbent dosage is introduced and can be expressed by the following equation 3 m r t m 2 c r t m 1 c m 2 m 1 in this equation m 2 and m 1 represent different adsorbent dosages similarly the variation of the average adsorption rate induced by the initial concentration of antibiotics can also be expressed by 4 c r t m c 2 r t m c 1 c 2 c 1 finally to quantify the selective adsorption of mofs based materials for tc the selectivity coefficient can be determined by the following equation 5 η q t tc q t tc q t smz q t tmp 100 in addition the used adsorbents could be recycled by a multi stage process including centrifugation soaking and washing with methanol and drying in the vacuum oven and the adsorption performance measurement of recycled adsorbents was repeated for three cycles 2 4 evaluation methods for the membrane perm selectivity performance in this work three parameters including the water flux and the forward reverse solute fluxes were used to evaluate the perm selectivity performance of membranes in detail the water flux can be calculated by the following equation 6 j w m d t a cell where t m d and a cell are the operation time the mass variation of the ds at a given time interval and the membrane area 0 0021 m2 respectively for the solute diffusion the antibiotics in fs can transfer from the fs side to the ds side thus the forward solute diffusion for antibiotics j s ab can be obtained by 7 j s ab v d t c d t v d 0 c d 0 m ab t a cell where v d 0 v d t and c d 0 c d t are the volume and the antibiotic concentration in ds at the initial time or t and m ab is the molar mass of the antibiotics in addition the kcl in ds can transfer from the ds side to the fs side thus the reverse solute diffusion for kcl j s kcl can be expressed by 8 j s kcl v f t c f t v f 0 c f 0 m kcl t a cell in this equation c f 0 c f t is the concentration of kcl in fs at the initial time or t m kcl is the molar mass of potassium chloride and the concentration of kcl in fs was measured by an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes icap7200 thermo fisher usa 2 5 theoretical calculations for the interaction between mofs and antibiotics after the geometry optimization of mofs and antibiotics the binding energies ebd between them could be obtained by the following equation 9 e bd e ab e a e b in this equation eab is the total energy for the adsorption between antibiotics and mofs ea eb is the energy of mofs or antibiotics respectively the geometry optimization and energy calculation were done by using the generalized gradient approximation gga with the perdew wang 1991 pw91 exchange correlation functional 50 the binding energies between mofs and antibiotics are summarized in table 2 it should be noted that the more negative the value of ebd the stronger the interaction between mofs and antibiotics also the positive value of ebd represents that adsorption is very difficult to occur 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of mofs based adsorbents mil 101 fe and nh2 mil 101 fe as the antibiotic adsorbents were characterized by using different methods i e sem xrd ft ir zeta potential and bet bjh and illustrated in fig 1 firstly it can be seen from the sem images in fig 1 a and b that both mil 101 fe and nh2 mil 101 fe were typical octahedral structures but the latter had a smaller crystal size than the former in fig 1 c the xrd patterns of mil 10 fe and nh2 mil 101 fe were similar and showed good agreement with results in reported studies suggesting the successful synthesis and good purity of these two mil 101s in detail the characteristic peaks of mil 101 fe appeared at 9 48 and 18 88 and the ones of nh2 mil 101 fe occurred at 9 58 and 18 62 this is because the two ligands used in mil 101 fe h2bdc and nh2 mil 101 fe nh2 h2bdc have similar molecular structures moreover fig 1 d showed mil 101 fe and nh2 mil 101 fe had similar ft ir spectrums due to the same trivalent metal centers and carboxylate bridging ligands the difference is the presence of the peaks representing ch and nh groups in the ft ir spectrum of nh2 mil 101 fe in detail the characteristic peaks at 1253 cm 1 could be attributed to the vibration of the cn bond in the aromatic amines and the doublet peaks at 3455 and 3297 cm 1 resulted from the amine moieties confirming the presence of 2 aminoterephthalate anions in nh2 mil 101 fe 51 52 fig 1 e shows the dependence of zeta potentials of mil 101 fe and nh2 mil 101 fe on the ph value it is very evident that the isoelectric points of both mofs adsorbents were approximately equivalent 5 0 for nh2 mil 101 fe versus 5 5 for mil 101 fe and the evolution curves were similar implying that the charges of these two particle surfaces were the same under certain ph value in other words the variation between these two mofs based adsorbents for electrostatic interactions with one specific antibiotic can be neglectable fig 1 f showed that the bet surface area of nh2 mil 101 fe was significantly lower than the one of mil 101 fe 501 m2 g versus 1006 m2 g accordingly the pore volume and the mean pore size for the former were also lower than the latter 0 21 cm3 g versus 0 14 cm3 g and 2 8 nm versus 2 5 nm based on the aforementioned results the possible adsorption mechanism of two prepared mofs based adsorbents with antibiotics is analyzed for the target analytes i e antibiotics fig 2 a to c illustrated that the ph values of all antibiotic containing aqueous solutions located in the range of 5 7 to 7 1 with the increase of the solution concentration from 20 mg l to 100 mg l and the solution temperature from 25 c to 45 c furthermore the charge characteristics of these three antibiotics tc tmp and smz in aqueous solutions as a function of ph are depicted in fig 2 d by combining fig 2 d with fig 2 e it can be found that both the adsorbents and the target pollutants have negative surface charges in the ph range 5 7 7 1 light purple boxes in fig 1 e and d and the tc in aqueous solution exhibits the strongest negative charge in this sense electrostatic interactions are playing a negative effect on the antibiotic removal using two prepared mofs based adsorbents and tc with the largest negative charge is least preferable under the current situation also the pore filling effect related to specific surface area and pore volume is one critical factor affecting antibiotic adsorption the larger the specific surface area and pore volume of absorbents the stronger the pore filling effect which resulted in superior adsorption fig 1 f showed that the bet surface area of nh2 mil 101 fe was significantly lower than the one of mil 101 fe 501 m2 g versus 1006 m2 g accordingly the pore volume and the mean pore size for the former were also lower than the latter 0 21 cm3 g versus 0 14 cm3 g and 2 8 nm versus 2 5 nm thus merely relying on the pore filling effect nh2 mil 101 fe with lower specific surface area and pore parameters was less suitable to adsorb and remove some target pollutants i e antibiotics compared to mil 101 fe if the antibiotic adsorption with mil 101s was governed by the electrostatic interaction and the pore filling effect it is very obvious that nh2 mil 101 fe and tc should be the worst couple and the adsorption of nh2 mil 101 fe with the other two antibiotics was not comparable with mil 101 fe however the adsorption between mil 101s and antibiotics was also affected by other three adsorption mechanisms including coordination bonds π π interaction and h bonding therefore the possible deviation between current theoretical prediction and experimental results could be explained by the influence of these three mechanisms on the adsorption 3 2 selective adsorption of mil 101s with antibiotics in this section a series of adsorption experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of adsorption conditions on the adsorption between mil 101s and three representative antibiotics tc smz and tmp based on experimental results and theoretical calculation the possible adsorption mechanism was further analyzed and some evidence was expected to provide an intrinsic explanation of why the membrane pre concentration stage was prerequisite in the context of antibiotic containing sewage wastewater treatment 3 2 1 effects of adsorption time on adsorption performance commonly chemical adsorption is one selective adsorption operation however physical adsorption is non selective more significantly the adsorption for the latter is usually unstable and the desorption occurs during the operation thus adsorption time is one direct and simple index to judge whether the adsorption process is governed by chemical adsorption or not fig 3 a illustrates the antibiotic adsorption capacity of mil 101s as a function of the antibiotic type and the adsorption time for tc it can be found that the antibiotic adsorption amounts of both mofs based adsorbents increased with the increase of the adsorption time and reached the peak value at 18 h red and black lines in the yz projection however the adsorption capacity for both tmp and smz had a peak value with the adsorption time significantly differentiating from the adsorption behavior for tc and indirectly showing that the adsorption process was physically dominated moreover the adsorption kinetics model was used to understand the adsorption pathway of mil 101s and tc as illustrated in supporting information supplementary note 1 the adsorption of tc on two prepared mil 101s is well fitted by the pseudo second order model implying that the adsorption is mainly governed by chemical interaction in addition several adsorption mechanisms including coordination bonds π π interaction electrostatic interaction hydrogen bonds and pore filling effect have been used to elucidate observed adsorption behavior between mofs and antibiotics the open metal size of mil 101s and oxygenous nitrogenous groups from tc smz tmp provide the possibility to form coordination bonds positively beneficial to adsorption also π π interaction hydrogen bonds and pore filling effect are playing positive roles in adsorption however electrostatic repulsion occurs between mil 101s and antibiotics because both surfaces are negatively charged and tc with a larger negative charge certainly leads to strong electrostatic repulsion therefore the electrostatic repulsion and other weak attraction effects are responsible for the desorption of smz and tmp which is corresponding to the simulated results in table 2 and the initial decrease of tmp and smz in the solution can be attributed to the pore filling effect but very weaker interaction or strong repulsion between tmp smz and mil 101s make them diffuse back to the solution as a consequence mil 101 fe with a larger specific surface area and pore volume adsorbed more smz and tmp at the initial stage however the desorption of tc did not happen despite stronger electrostatic repulsion between tc and mil 101s furthermore one closer observation revealed that the adsorption of tc on nh2 mil 101 fe was far stronger than mil 101 fe which was opposite to the situation of mil 101s in the pore filling effect such result indicates that the pore filling effect is not a key factor affecting the adsorption capacity of mil 101s for tc which can also be explained by the intra particle diffusion model as illustrated in fig s5 supporting information the adsorption process was not only governed by intra diffusion and affected by other adsorption effects in detail tc diffused more freely inside nh2 mil 101 fe than mil 101 fe and the former one was more significantly affected by the boundary layer taken together other potential adsorption effects should have played a more significant role resulting in stronger interactions between adsorbents and target pollutants recent studies revealed that the adsorption between mil 101 fe and tc could be affected by hydrogen bonding interactions 53 but the amino group in nh2 mil 101 fe was inclined to form strong hydrogen bonds with hydroxyl groups in the target molecules 54 as illustrated in fig 3 b the bandwidth of nh and oh groups broadens and the corresponding intensity is enlarged after the adsorption of mil 101s with antibiotics suggesting the formation of h bonding also fig 3 c and d demonstrated the presence of the h bonding interaction between tmp or smz and mil 101s but the band intensities of mil 101s after adsorbed with tmp and smz are weaker than the one for tc reflecting the weaker h bonding interaction in addition the strong polar antibiotics with the lower log k ow are more preferable to be removed by using mil 101s corresponding to the h bonding induced efficient extraction of bisphenols and their derivatives using mil 101s 54 furthermore it is well known that the hydrogen bonding effect is a relatively weak interaction compared to chemical bonding i e covalent bonding but the numerous h bond acceptors and donors in tc facilitate the formation of the multi effect h bond interaction causing the strong interaction of mil 101s and tc and showing the similar adsorption behavior with chemical adsorption as shown in fig 3 a meanwhile there are two hydrogen atoms in the h bond donor of nh2 providing more opportunities to form the h bond and enhancing the adsorption capacity 55 such result can also be demonstrated by the more negative value of ebd between nh2 mil 101 fe and tc compared with mil 101 fe 173 kj mol vs 142 kj mol as shown in table 2 in this point tc in the livestock sewage containing these three antibiotics can be selectively removed when the retention time is larger than the desorption time of smz tmp from mil 101s 3 2 2 effects of adsorbent dosage on adsorption performance in this section the average adsorption rate rt m c and the variation of the corresponding average adsorption rate induced by the adsorbent dosage m were used to determine the optimal adsorbent dosage it should be noted that rt m c is determined by the maximum adsorption amount and corresponding adsorption time eq 2 in detail the adsorption times of mil 101s for tc tmp and smz are 18 h 6 h and 4 h respectively as illustrated in fig 4 a all rt m c declined with the increase of the adsorbent dosage which can be caused by two possible situations as shown in fig 5 1st possible situation the antibiotic amount is so far less than the adsorbent dosage that the redundant adsorbent has no opportunity to adsorb the antibiotics in water under 2nd possible situation the antibiotic cannot be fully removed when the adsorbent dosage is at one low level i e 5 mg but when the adsorbent dosage is increased to one higher level i e 10 mg an additional 5 mg mofs is enough to completely remove the remaining antibiotics in other words if 5 mg mofs can be viewed as one adsorbent unit other adsorbent units at higher than 5 mg adsorbent dosage are wasting their adsorption abilities for 5 mg mofs increasing the antibiotic concentration is one simple and feasible method to eliminate the aforementioned doubt this is because increasing antibiotic concentration under 1st possible situation results in a larger adsorption capacity but it is useless to enhance the adsorption efficiency under 2nd possible situation the results showed that when the initial antibiotic concentration increased to 120 mg l rt m c is approximately equal to the one for 100 mg l implying that the minimal adsorbent dosage 5 mg is still far larger than the required dosage for the current antibiotic concentration 100 mg l thus the decline in rt m c can be explained by 1st situation illustrated in fig 5 also fig 4 b illustrates the dependence of m on the adsorbent dosage it can be found that all m is negative and m approaches zero with the increase of adsorbent dosage implying that the increased adsorbent dosage 5 mg is unbeneficial to enhance the absorption rate thus the adsorbent dosage is set to 5 mg in the following sections 3 2 3 effects of initial antibiotic concentration on adsorption performance for certain adsorbent dosages too high or too low initial antibiotic concentration means that the antibiotics cannot be fully removed or the adsorbent is wasting its adsorption capacity moreover the interaction between tc and mofs based adsorbent becomes weaker when the adsorption layer number is larger than 1 potentially resulting in decreased adsorption efficiency thus there should be an optimal match for the adsorption between the mofs based adsorbent and the antibiotics in an aqueous solution fig 6 illustrates the functions of average adsorption rates rt m c and corresponding variations induced by initial antibiotic concentration c with initial tc concentration both rt m c for tc and two mofs based adsorbent increase with the increase of initial tc concentration in other words a high initial tc concentration is beneficial to enhance the adsorption rate when the adsorbent is sufficient for tc highlighting the significance to enhance the antibiotic concentration in water in addition c firstly increased and then began to decrease at about 40 mg l of initial tc concentration the presence of the turning point indirectly suggests that the multi layer adsorption occurs when the initial tc concentration is higher than 40 mg l since the adsorption force decreases gradually with the adsorption layer from inside to outside according to the theory of polanyi adsorption potential in addition the adsorption isotherm was utilized to distinguish between multilayer and monolayer adsorption as analyzed in supporting information the adsorption between tc and mil 101s can be better described by the langmuir model however it should be noted that the adsorption data well fitted by the langmuir model could not support the conclusion that the adsorption was governed by monolayer adsorption behavior especially when the pore diameter of the adsorbent was 2 3 nm based on such consideration the adsorption layer number is approximately estimated by n s tc θs mofs where θ is the surface coverage smofs stc is the total surface area of mofs and adsorbed tc as illustrated in table s3 it can be found that when the surface coverage is 0 84 the adsorption layers of tc onto both mil 101s are more than a monolayer and although the surface coverage approaches 1 tc adsorbed onto nh2 mil 101 fe is governed by multi layer adsorption behavior the 100 or relatively high surface coverage cannot occur in the actual solid liquid adsorption system due to the interaction and steric hindrance of different tc molecules therefore the adsorption layers of tc onto these two mil 101s are very likely to be multi layer at this point even though increased initial tc concentration resulted in a higher adsorption rate the concentration induced adsorption efficiency began to decrease at a certain concentration 40 mg l for tc also one closer observation revealed that the turning point for the adsorption between nh2 mil 101 fe and tc came early than mil 101 fe this is because lower surface area and stronger interaction for the former make the adsorbent surface quicker filled by tc however the same behavior cannot be found in the adsorption between mil 101s and the other two antibiotics fig s3 also fig s4 illustrates that maximum adsorption amounts of mil 101s for tmp and smz increase linearly with initial antibiotic concentration all r2 0 97 and the intercept is fixed to zero indirectly demonstrating that initial adsorption behaviors of mil 101s for tmp and smz in fig 3 a are mainly governed by the pore filling effect therefore the initial tc concentration is set to 40 mg l for maximum adsorption efficiency and the same initial concentrations of tmp and smz 40 mg l were selected concerning their potential negative influence on the adsorption of tc onto mil 101s 3 2 4 effect of adsorption temperature on adsorption performance according to the thermodynamics of the adsorption process the adsorption capacity for physical adsorption decreased with the increased adsorption temperature because of negative adsorption heat however the adsorption capacity for chemical adsorption showed the first increase and then decreased trend because of the existence of activation energy if the input energy namely low operation temperature was less than the activation energy the adsorption capacity increased with increased temperature otherwise the desorption occurred at higher adsorption temperatures thereby rendering decreased adsorption capacity fig 7 a illustrates the evolution of the adsorption between two prepared mofs based adsorbents nh2 mil 101 fe and mil 101 fe and three different antibiotics tc tmp and smz at different adsorption temperatures the adsorption behavior of both mofs based adsorbents for tmp and smz show the characteristics of physical adsorption however higher adsorption capacity for tc can be found at higher adsorption temperatures differentiating from the situation for tmp and smz this is because the strong interaction between mofs based adsorbents and tc makes their adsorption show similar behavior with chemical adsorption which is in good agreement with the aforementioned analysis more significantly fig 7 b illustrates the dependence of the ratio of the adsorption capacity for tc to the one for tmp or smz on the adsorption temperature it can be seen that both qe tc qe tmp and qe tc qe smz increase with the increase of the adsorption temperature implying that higher adsorption temperature can cause a more significant difference between tc and tmp or smz in the adsorption capacities of these two mofs based adsorbents in addition one closer observation reveals that using nh2 mil 101 fe as the adsorbent can achieve more superiorly selective adsorption for tc and the other two antibiotics compared to mil 101 fe for instance qe tc qe tmp and qe tc qe smz at 25 c are 1 75 and 1 55 by using mil 101 fe while the ones increase to 2 38 and 2 13 by using nh2 mil 101 fe the same situation can also be found at higher adsorption temperatures therefore a high adsorption temperature is preferable for the selective separation of these three antibiotics in water and 45 c was used as the optimal adsorption temperature in the following section 3 2 5 selective adsorption and reusability of mofs based adsorbents for antibiotics in the solution containing three antibiotics tc smz and tmp two mofs based adsorbents mil 101 fe and nh2 mil 101 fe were used to investigate their selective adsorption for tc as illustrated in fig 3 a the desorption behavior occurred after 4 h for tmp and smz but the adsorption effect for tc was still strengthened at this time thus the adsorption time is one critical parameter to present the evolution of selective adsorption fig 8 shows the dependence of the selectivity coefficient of mofs based adsorbent for tc on the adsorption time the selective coefficients for both mofs based adsorbents increased with the increase of adsorption time this is because the adsorption amount for smz and tmp became decreased when the adsorption time was longer than 4 h fig 8 also revealed that selective coefficients of mil 101 fe were higher than 70 while nh2 mil 101 fe showed more superior selective adsorption for tc 85 more significantly the selective coefficient of nh2 mil 101 fe can reach up to 95 at 24 h in this sense using mil 101 fe as the adsorbent can effectively remove tc from the aqueous solution containing tc tmp and smz considering the low concentration of antibiotics in an actual aqueous system high efficiently concentrating the antibiotic containing aqueous solution with low energy consumption is of significance and will be discussed in the following section in addition the reusability of two prepared mofs based adsorbents was investigated concerning their economic availability as illustrated in fig 9 the adsorption capacity decreased gradually with the increase of the cycle number which might be attributed to the physical chemical structure damage of mofs based adsorbent during the multi stage regeneration process however the adsorption capacities of two adsorbents still reached up to 90 of the original ones after 4th adsorption experiment therefore even though the current regeneration method can sacrifice the adsorption capacity to some extent the adsorption performance is still located at a high level 3 3 membrane pre concentration experiments with low energy consumption the fo process without the ds regeneration can be viewed as one low energy consumption membrane separation process based on such consideration kcl one representative fertilizer was used as the solute of ds thereby rendering that diluted ds could be used for agricultural fertigation meanwhile tc smz tmp three representative antibiotics were used as the solutes of fs and the actual fo performance was governed by both intrinsic membrane properties and operating conditions therefore one commercially available fo membrane was firstly used to investigate the effects of some operation conditions including temperature difference fertilizer concentration and the antibiotic type and concentration on its perm selective performance water flux forward antibiotic flux and reverse k flux 3 3 1 fo without ds generation antibiotic concentration and fertilizer dilution high water permeation and low solute leakage are highly required at the membrane pre concentration stage therefore fig 10 illustrates the evolution of the water flux the reverse k flux and the forward antibiotic tc flux with the fs concentration the ds concentration and operating temperature difference it can be found that higher water flux occurs at higher ds concentration lower fs concentration and higher temperature difference resulting from higher osmotic pressure difference or driving force across the membrane and higher pure water permeability coefficient antibiotic concentration and fertilizer dilution at the membrane pre concentration stage will cause a continuous reduction in water flux considering that antibiotics in aqueous solutions could not cause severe membrane fouling compared with other foulants in actual antibiotics containing wastewater 56 57 the driving force osmotic pressure attenuation resulting from the decrease in the concentration difference across the membrane should be responsible for the aforementioned water flux decline behavior for instance the water flux at cf1 and cd3 was 20 30 lmh but the one at cf3 and cd1 had decreased to 8 36 lmh by 58 82 such water flux evolution behavior is unbeneficial to achieving high concentration and dilution efficiency to mitigate reverse k leakage higher kcl concentration and temperature difference are not preferable this is because reverse k flux is governed by the solute permeability coefficient and the concentration difference js b c and the former is positively related to the temperature 58 also the tc concentration on the fs side affects the k diffusion thereby rendering enhanced fertilizer leakage it can be seen that this effect was relatively weak at the low temperature difference but the effect was strengthened at the high temperature difference which can be attributed to the donnan dialysis 59 as schematically depicted in fig 11 in detail when the fs concentration was increased as shown in the right part of fig 11 more tc diffused through the membrane from the fs side to the ds side due to higher concentration difference in addition fig 2 a revealed that the coupled ion in tc solution was h because the solution was weak acid the additional diffusion of tc changes original solution electroneutrality in the fs and ds sides respectively accordingly more coupled h and reverse cl have high probability to transport through the membrane so as to achieve new solution electroneutrality as a consequence more k also diffuses from ds to fs this behavior becomes more significant at high temperature difference due to the fact that high temperature is responsible for high solute diffusion across the membrane based on aforementioned analysis low temperature difference is conducive to mitigating k leakage sacrificing water permeation efficiency fig 10 also shows that the forward tc flux was strongly affected by the temperature difference the tc concentration and the kcl concentration the effect mechanism of the first two operation conditions on forward tc diffusion can be described by the sd model according to the sd model increased tc concentration difference and membrane solute permeability certainly result in more tc diffusion from the feed side to the ds side in addition the donnan dialysis can also be used to illuminate the mechanism of the kcl concentration on forward tc flux as shown in the left part of fig 11 increased kcl concentration on the ds side means high reverse k diffusion then the solution electroneutrality necessitates the further diffusion of cl and h as the original orientation under such a scenario more tc transports through the membrane and enters into the ds similar to the reverse k diffusion the forward tc diffusion also suffers from a high temperature difference in detail at the high temperature difference both the initial solution configuration high kcl concentration and low tc concentration and final solution configuration decreased kcl concentration and increased tc concentration are shown to not mitigate the solute leakage but enhance the solute diffusion therefore although the high temperature difference is preferable for water flux severe solute leakage confined the fo based pre concentration process at the low temperature difference based on the aforementioned analysis the final concentration for these three antibiotics in the membrane pre concentration stage had better not be higher than 40 mg l to obtain the optimal adsorption efficiency in the subsequent adsorption stage furthermore the final fertilizer solution needs to be diluted to one lower concentration 1 m in this section thus the fo performances for the pre concentration of three antibiotics were compared under conditions of 1 m kcl as the ds and 40 mg l antibiotics as the fs and was depicted in fig 12 both forward antibiotic and reverse k diffusions should be mitigated to some extent and pure water was expected to transport more across the membrane as shown in fig 12 a tc at different operation temperature differences is easier to diffuse through the used commercial tfc fo membrane compared to the other three solutes tmp smz and k which is unbeneficial to the selective adsorption for tc in addition the ratio of the sum of forward antibiotic and reverse k fluxes to water flux can be denoted as specific reverse solute flux srsf was used to evaluate the perm selective performance of fo membranes by incorporating the water flux the less the srsf the more pure water is through the membrane than the solutes fig 12 b illustrates the combination between tc and k results in more solute leakage per unit water flux compared to the other two combinations this may be because the strong h bonding interaction between tc and h2o facilitates the conjunct diffusion of water molecules and tc through the membrane therefore tc tmp and smz can be concentrated in fo but high tc and k leakage adversely affect the concentration efficiency at this point the leakage for the target solute in fo limits its application in the current separation system furthermore the water flux in fo is strongly dependent on the concentration difference between fs and ds thus continuous fs concentration and ds dilution in fo also sacrifice the water flux and the concentration efficiency taken together fo technology should not be viewed as the first choice to treat antibiotics containing wastewater and achieve agricultural fertigation 3 3 2 an alternative pathway temperature enhanced osmotic membrane distillation the above mentioned discussion evokes one question there is an alternative pathway to concentrate antibiotic wastewater and simultaneously dilute fertilizer solution in our previous study temperature enhanced osmotic membrane distillation t omd had demonstrated to ensure higher water flux and lower fertilizer loss at high temperature differences than fo 60 based on such situation t omd is expected to mitigate severe antibiotic and fertilizer leakage in fo in t omd the water flux is less susceptible to the tc concentration and kcl concentration 43 17 47 33 lmh and water fluxes in t omd are larger than the ones in fo under the same conditions as illustrated in fig 13 a potentially implying that the more stable and higher water flux occurred in t omd also figs 13 b and 13 c show that fertilizer and antibiotic leakage can be effectively mitigated in t omd for instance the forward tc flux and the reverse k flux in t omd have decreased to 0 07 0 45 and 0 04 0 38 of the ones in fo higher water flux and lower solute leakage are responsible for the superior perm selectivity performance in t omd as shown in fig 13 d for instance the ratio of the srsf in t omd to the one in fo ranges from 0 04 to 0 24 suggesting that 99 76 solute leakage can be avoided in t omd more significantly the higher temperature for the concentrated antibiotic containing fs stream discharging from t omd is beneficial to enhance the adsorption efficiency in the subsequent adsorption stage thereby weakening the economic consideration about high thermal input for heating the fs steam therefore t omd can provide an alternative membrane based option to high efficiently remove antibiotics in livestock sewerage and simultaneously achieve agricultural fertigation 3 4 preliminary energy consumption analyses for standalone adsorption system and membrane pre concentration and adsorption hybrid system referring to fig 6 the ratio of the adsorption rate at 40 mg l to the one at 5 mg l is located in the range of 10 12 depending on the adsorbent type in this section the adsorption ratio was selected as 12 under the same adsorption process configuration and antibiotic removal amount number 12 represents the antibiotics containing feed stream that enters the adsorption stage more than a dozen times in addition the initial tc concentration is supposed to be 5 mg l and q and its concentration can be concentrated to 40 mg l after the membrane pre concentration stage accordingly the initial feed flowrate is fixed at 8q and the stream flowrate after the membrane pre concentration stage decreased to q based on these assumptions the standalone adsorption and hybrid systems are shown in fig 14 the energy consumption in the standalone adsorption system results mainly from the pump and can be expressed by es pre 12 wt 8q p η in this equation pre is the electricity price wt is the referenced working time in the hybrid system p is the hydraulic pressure and η is the pump efficiency in addition if the thermal energy is easily accessible and its cost can be neglected the energy in the hybrid system is also mainly consumed in the pump and can be estimated by the following equation as eh pre wt 8 1 q p η pre wt 9q p η the ratio of es to eh can reach up to 32 3 which means that up to 90 63 of energy can be saved via incorporating the membrane pre concentration stage what s more one universal equation can be used to build the relationship between energy consumption in these systems es eh m n 1 n in this equation m represents the ratio of the adsorption rate at concentrated feed concentration to the one at initial feed concentration and n represents the concentration multiple it should be noted that m is positively related to n therefore es eh increases significantly with increased concentration multiple 3 5 potential implication of membrane pre concentration and adsorption hybrid system to high efficiently remove antibiotics in livestock sewerage and simultaneously achieve agricultural fertigation the membrane pre concentration process i e fo or t omd 1st mofs based selective adsorption process and 2nd adsorption biodegradation process was integrated and illustrated in fig 15 after the solid liquid separation process to remove some solid state organisms in livestock sewage not mentioned in fig 15 the antibiotics containing sewage was subsequently delivered into the membrane pre concentration stage in which the antibiotics containing sewage was used as the fs and the high concentration fertilizer solution was used as the ds in this stage the water can transfer from the fs side to the ds side as a consequence the concentration of antibiotics in fs increased while the high concentration fertilizer solution was diluted it should be noted that all membranes are not 100 solute rejection thus the forward and reverse solute diffusions are two critical indexes to evaluate whether the membrane process can minimize fertilizer loss and antibiotic leakage then the diluted fertilizer solution can be delivered to the fertilizer supply station and concentrated livestock sewage entered the mofs based adsorption stage in which the antibiotics can be selectively and effectively removed by the adsorption interaction between mofs and specific antibiotics the remaining antibiotics can be removed in the subsequent adsorption biodegradation stage which has been involved in the reported study and thus is not discussed in this work finally the product water without antibiotics can be used to further dilute the fertilizer solution concerning the demand for crop growth or as the water utilization in the livestock industry based on the such design conventional livestock and plant farming industries can be seamlessly combined by achieving the high efficient utilization of water resources furthermore the products from the farmland i e soybean can be used as feedstuff in the livestock industry while the animal excrement can be used as fertilizer in the farmland taken together the proposed hybrid system is beneficial to achieve the sustainable development of the livestock and plant farming industries by the dual recycling pathway for the water and nutrient fertilizer resources 4 concluding remarks in this work one membrane pre concentration and mof based selective adsorption hybrid system was proposed to high efficiently and selectively remove antibiotics in livestock sewerage and simultaneously achieve agricultural fertigation the main conclusions can be drawn as the following 1 two common mofs based materials mil 101 fe and nh2 mil 101 fe were used as the adsorbents to remove the antibiotics in water adsorption experiments showed that two distinct different adsorption behaviors occurred for using two mil 101s to remove three representative antibiotics tc smz and tmp in livestock sewerage potentially resulting from stronger h bonding interaction and larger h bond number between tc and mil 101s the adsorption capacity was strongly related to the adsorption time with the increase of the adsorption time the adsorption capacity for tc increased to a constant and maximum value but the one for smz and tmp showed a first increased and then decreased trend for certain adsorbent dosages there was one optimal initial antibiotic concentration i e 40 mg l for tc corresponding to 5 mg mil 101s to obtain maximum adsorption efficiency highlighting the significance to enhance the antibiotic concentration and determining the final concentration in the membrane pre concentration stage also a high adsorption temperature was preferable for the selective separation of tc from the wastewater containing these three antibiotics when the adsorption time ranged from 12 h to 24 h selective coefficients of mil 101 fe were higher than 70 however nh2 mil 101 fe showed superior selective adsorption for tc 85 especially the selective coefficient of nh2 mil 101 fe for tc could reach up to 95 at 24 h therefore using nh2 mil 101 fe as the adsorbent could effectively remove tc from the aqueous solution containing tc tmp and smz and preferable operation conditions i e high adsorption temperature and suitably high antibiotic concentration necessitated the thermal input and the membrane pre concentration process 2 membrane pre concentration experiments showed that tc tmp and smz could be concentrated in fo but high tc and k leakage adversely affected the concentration efficiency furthermore water flux in fo was strongly dependent on the concentration difference between fs and ds thus the water flux decline was inevitable in fo taken together fo technology should not be viewed as the first choice to treat antibiotics containing wastewater and achieve agricultural fertigation potential problems of the fo technology and the intrinsic demand of the selective adsorption process initiated the application of t omd the experimental result showed that the water flux was less susceptible to the tc and kcl concentration 43 17 47 33 lmh and was larger than the ones in fo under the same conditions fertilizer and antibiotic leakage were effectively mitigated in t omd where 99 76 solute leakage could be avoided therefore t omd could provide an alternative membrane based option to high efficiently remove antibiotics in livestock sewerage and simultaneously achieve agricultural fertigation declaration of competing interest the authors declare

antibiotics in the livestock sewerage are responsible for antimicrobial resistance causing a global public health crisis and necessitating high efficient and environmental friendly antibiotic treatment processes herein one membrane pre concentration and mof based selective adsorption hybrid system is proposed to high efficiently remove tetracycline tc from the aqueous solution containing other two representative antibiotics sulfamethoxazole smz and trimethoprim tmp in the livestock sewage in this work two common mofs based materials mil 101 fe and nh2 mil 101 fe are employed as the adsorbents to selectively remove tc from the solution adsorption experiments showed that the selective coefficient of nh2 mil 101 fe for tc could reach up to 95 because of stronger interaction between tc and mil 101s calculated via the theoretical simulation also experimental results demonstrated that the desired operating conditions necessitated thermal input and pre concentration operation accordingly temperature enhanced forward osmosis t fo and temperature enhanced osmotic membrane distillation t omd were proposed to concentrate the solution containing these three antibiotics in the cost effective way where the fertilizer solution kcl in this work was used as the draw solution ds and diluted ds solution could be used in agricultural fertigation membrane pre concentration experiments showed that tc tmp and smz could be theoretically concentrated in t fo but high tc and kcl leakage and inevitable water flux decline behavior significantly sacrificed the concentration efficiency thereby initiating the application of t omd higher and more stable water flux occurred in t omd and 99 76 of antibiotic and kcl leakage could be mitigated compared to t fo thereby providing one option to high efficiently remove antibiotics in livestock sewerage and achieve agricultural fertigation graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords selective adsorption membrane concentration antibiotics hybrid system data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction antibiotics as antibacterial agents have been widely used to prevent diseases in animal husbandry the poultry industry and aquaculture 1 4 it is reported that the global consumption of antibiotics has reached up to 300 000 tons year and most of them are employed in the livestock industry 5 6 as a consequence the antibiotics in the environment mainly originate from livestock sewerage based on such situation china as the global dominant antibiotic and meat consumer has to confront an extremely high risk of antibiotic resistance from its misuse and overuse 7 8 potentially causing one million deaths year and cumulative economic losses of 20 trillion in 2050 also world health organization who describes antimicrobial resistance as a global public health crisis necessitating urgent action therefore high efficiently removing the antibiotics in the water is vital to achieving sustainable development for both antibiotic and livestock industries numerous technologies including electrochemical process 9 ultrasonic treatment 10 advanced oxidation 11 12 membrane filtration 13 and adsorption technique 14 had been introduced and further investigated to remove antibiotics in water compared with other technologies the adsorption has great potential to high efficiently and environmental friendly achieve antibiotic removal because of low cost simple operation excellent adaptability and no secondary pollution 15 17 to date activated carbon 18 clay minerals 19 humus 20 zeolite 21 graphene oxide 22 biochar 23 24 mxene based nanomaterials 25 and nano zero valent iron nzvi based materials 26 have been reported to remove various antibiotics from wastewaters by the adsorption based interaction mechanism among these conventional and emerging adsorbent materials metal organic frameworks mofs as one new kind of porous material with highly ordered crystal structure have also attracted extensive attention in antibiotic removal due to their unique adsorption performance from the characteristics of large specific surface area high and tunable porosity molecular level customizability abundant active functional sites and superior mechanical stability 27 33 compared with other mofs base materials mil 101 fe one of mofs with iron as the central metal and terephthalic acid as the organic ligand is endowed with low synthesis cost feasible preparation method and good chemical thermal stability in aqueous solution and exhibits excellent adsorption performance for antibiotics 34 37 furthermore tetracycline tc trimethoprim tmp and sulfamethoxazole smz as three broad spectrum antibiotics appearing as early as the 20th century are widely used and accounts for 20 of all antibiotics 38 39 numerous studies focused on using mil 101 fe to adsorb the tc in the water in detail dong et al 34 prepared mil 101 fe series materials via microwave assisted synthesis and used them to remove tc in water showing good adsorption performance that the adsorption capacity could reach 300 mg g besides wang et al 36 and li et al 37 compared the adsorption capacities of three fe based mofs mil 101 fe mil 100 fe and mil 53 fe on tc and their results reached the same conclusion that mil 101 fe had the best adsorption effect on tc under the same experimental conditions but for the removal of the other two antibiotics tmp and smz the first choice is not mofs based adsorbent but carbon based materials i e activated carbon and graphene because of stronger adsorption between these two antibiotics and carbon based materials 40 41 in this sense mofs based adsorbents can selectively remove tc from the water containing these three antibiotics furthermore the content of antibiotics in the water commonly ranges from ng l to μg l thus the direct adsorption process without the pre concentration stage is bound to cause a significant increase in the operational expenditure opex since the system has to treat a huge amount of wastewater compared to the trace antibiotics as such forward osmosis fo as one representative of the membrane pre concentration process is driven by the osmotic pressure difference between the low concentration feed solution fs and the high concentration draw solution ds across the membrane 11 42 based on such characteristics fo can be viewed as one low energy consumption membrane process without the regeneration of the ds and it has been widely applied in several fields such as the concentration for some temperature sensitive products 43 44 and agricultural fertigation 45 48 especially for agricultural fertigation fo has been intensively investigated as potentially affordable and sustainable water and fertilizer supply method in which fertilizer solutions were used as the ds to extract fresh water from some unconventional waters like seawater or high salinity wastewater and some low saline impaired waters accordingly the diluted fertilizer solution can be directly used and these unconventional saline water sources can be simultaneously recycled if the antibiotics containing livestock sewage is used as fs in the context of agricultural fertigation the antibiotics in the fs side can be further concentrated and the fertilizer ds solution can be diluted subsequent concentrated antibiotics wastewater enters the mofs based adsorption process potentially reducing the wastewater treatment load and enhancing adsorbent efficiency therefore the combination of fo and mofs based adsorption can achieve the high efficient removal of antibiotics from livestock sewerage and agricultural fertigation however to the best of our knowledge related studies have been rarely involved until now in this work the mofs based adsorption process was expected to achieve high efficient separation of tc from the livestock sewage including tc tmp and smz besides mil 101 fe its amine functionalized form nh2 mil 101 fe was selected as the antibiotic adsorbent since it can lead to strong affinity with target foulant through forming strong hydrogen bonding interaction mil 101 fe and nh2 mil 101 fe were synthesized and characterized by different characterization methods i e sem xrd zeta potential ft ir and pore analysis and their difference in possible adsorption mechanism was analyzed then the effects of adsorption conditions i e adsorption time adsorbent dosage initial antibiotic concentration and adsorption temperature on the adsorption performance between two mofs based adsorbents and three antibiotics were investigated to analyze the possible adsorption mechanism and provide some intrinsic evidence to explain why the membrane pre concentration stage was prerequisite in the context of antibiotic containing sewage wastewater treatment next kcl one representative fertilizer and tc smz tmp three representative antibiotics are used as the solutes of ds and fs in the fo process respectively the effects of operation conditions i e temperature difference fertilizer concentration and the antibiotic type and concentration on its perm selective performance water flux forward antibiotic flux and reverse k flux were evaluated to judge whether fo was one suitable membrane based pre concentration technology as another low energy membrane concentration process one temperature enhanced osmotic membrane distillation t omd was proposed as one alternative pathway to high efficiently concentrate the antibiotic containing wastewater and dilute the fertilizer solution based on experimental results and theoretical analyzes the membrane pre concentration and mofs based adsorption hybrid processes were introduced and detail described with the purpose of the selective and efficient removal of tc from the livestock sewage containing three representative antibiotics tc tmp and smz and simultaneous agricultural fertigation potentially achieving the seamless integration between agriculture and husbandry 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and reagents the reagents contain ferric chloride hexahydrate fecl3 6h2o 99 purified terephthalic acid h2bdc 99 2

tetracycline tc 98 sulfamethoxazole smz 98 and trimethoprim tmp 98 is illustrated in table 1 the flat sheet tfc fo membranes were purchased from toray chemical korea company limited jung gu seoul south korea and the flat sheet polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe hydrophobic membranes were friendly supplied by shengju environmental science and technology company limited hangzhou zhejiang china and the nominal pore size and thickness of the ptfe membrane are 1 and 40 μm 2 2 synthesis and characterization of mofs based adsorbents mil 101 fe and nh2 mil 101 fe were prepared via the hydrothermal synthesis method in previously reported studies 49 in detail 0 107 g fecl3 6h2o and 0 658 g h2bdc were dissolved in 90 ml dmf then 3 6 ml acetic acid was added to the solution fully stirred and transferred into the high temperature reaction kettle 100 ml in a drying oven kept at 110 c for 24 h after cooling to the ambient temperature the solution was centrifuged and the precipitate was recovered by washing the precipitation several times with anhydrous ethanol and dmf and further filtration pure precipitation was obtained finally the product was put into a vacuum drying oven and dried at 60 c for 24 h to remove the solvent molecules and metal ions in the mofs hole also nh2 mil 101 fe was prepared by the same method except that h2bdc was replaced by h2bdc nh2 in detail 1 914 g fecl3 6h2o and 0 512 g h2bdc nh2 were mixed and deliquescent by 60 ml dmf and 3 ml ethanoic acid subsequently other reaction conditions and procedures were the same as the ones for mil 101 fe then prepared mofs based adsorbents denoted as mil 101s were characterized by xrd utima iv x ray diffraction rigaku japan ft ir nicolet is50 ft ir fourier transform infrared spectrometer thermo fisher usa

specific surface area and porosity analyzer micromeritics usa 2 3 evaluation methods for the adsorption selectivity performance of mofs tc smz and tmp in an aqueous solution were adsorbed by mil 101 fe and nh2 mil 101 fe respectively tc or smz or tmp in an aqueous solution 100 mg l was prepared for subsequent experiments the working curve was obtained by using a uv vis spectrophotometer cary 60 agilent usa 5 mg of metal organic framework materials were dispersed in 50 ml pre prepared antibiotic solution and adsorbed in an oscillating chamber under certain conditions 25 c 200 rpm for a while 0 5 24 h the supernatant was purified by centrifugation and filtrated with a syringe filter polytetrafluoroethylene 0 5 μm the antibiotic concentration can be determined by the aforementioned working curve accordingly the adsorption capacity q can be obtained by the following equation 1 q c 0 c t v m in this equation c 0 c t represents the mass concentration of antibiotics at the initial time or t respectively v is the volume of the solution 50 ml and m is the mass of the adsorbent accordingly the average adsorption rate can be expressed by 2 r t m c q t m c t where t m and c in the subscript represent the adsorption time the adsorbent dosage and the initial concentration of antibiotics to configure the optimal dosage of mofs based adsorbent for high efficient removal of antibiotics the variation of the average adsorption rate induced by the adsorbent dosage is introduced and can be expressed by the following equation 3 m r t m 2 c r t m 1 c m 2 m 1 in this equation m 2 and m 1 represent different adsorbent dosages similarly the variation of the average adsorption rate induced by the initial concentration of antibiotics can also be expressed by 4 c r t m c 2 r t m c 1 c 2 c 1 finally to quantify the selective adsorption of mofs based materials for tc the selectivity coefficient can be determined by the following equation 5 η q t tc q t tc q t smz q t tmp 100 in addition the used adsorbents could be recycled by a multi stage process including centrifugation soaking and washing with methanol and drying in the vacuum oven and the adsorption performance measurement of recycled adsorbents was repeated for three cycles 2 4 evaluation methods for the membrane perm selectivity performance in this work three parameters including the water flux and the forward reverse solute fluxes were used to evaluate the perm selectivity performance of membranes in detail the water flux can be calculated by the following equation 6 j w m d t a cell where t m d and a cell are the operation time the mass variation of the ds at a given time interval and the membrane area 0 0021 m2 respectively for the solute diffusion the antibiotics in fs can transfer from the fs side to the ds side thus the forward solute diffusion for antibiotics j s ab can be obtained by 7 j s ab v d t c d t v d 0 c d 0 m ab t a cell where v d 0 v d t and c d 0 c d t are the volume and the antibiotic concentration in ds at the initial time or t and m ab is the molar mass of the antibiotics in addition the kcl in ds can transfer from the ds side to the fs side thus the reverse solute diffusion for kcl j s kcl can be expressed by 8 j s kcl v f t c f t v f 0 c f 0 m kcl t a cell in this equation c f 0 c f t is the concentration of kcl in fs at the initial time or t m kcl is the molar mass of potassium chloride and the concentration of kcl in fs was measured by an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes icap7200 thermo fisher usa 2 5 theoretical calculations for the interaction between mofs and antibiotics after the geometry optimization of mofs and antibiotics the binding energies ebd between them could be obtained by the following equation 9 e bd e ab e a e b in this equation eab is the total energy for the adsorption between antibiotics and mofs ea eb is the energy of mofs or antibiotics respectively the geometry optimization and energy calculation were done by using the generalized gradient approximation gga with the perdew wang 1991 pw91 exchange correlation functional 50 the binding energies between mofs and antibiotics are summarized in table 2 it should be noted that the more negative the value of ebd the stronger the interaction between mofs and antibiotics also the positive value of ebd represents that adsorption is very difficult to occur 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of mofs based adsorbents mil 101 fe and nh2 mil 101 fe as the antibiotic adsorbents were characterized by using different methods i e sem xrd ft ir zeta potential and bet bjh and illustrated in fig 1 firstly it can be seen from the sem images in fig 1 a and b that both mil 101 fe and nh2 mil 101 fe were typical octahedral structures but the latter had a smaller crystal size than the former in fig 1 c the xrd patterns of mil 10 fe and nh2 mil 101 fe were similar and showed good agreement with results in reported studies suggesting the successful synthesis and good purity of these two mil 101s in detail the characteristic peaks of mil 101 fe appeared at 9 48 and 18 88 and the ones of nh2 mil 101 fe occurred at 9 58 and 18 62 this is because the two ligands used in mil 101 fe h2bdc and nh2 mil 101 fe nh2 h2bdc have similar molecular structures moreover fig 1 d showed mil 101 fe and nh2 mil 101 fe had similar ft ir spectrums due to the same trivalent metal centers and carboxylate bridging ligands the difference is the presence of the peaks representing ch and nh groups in the ft ir spectrum of nh2 mil 101 fe in detail the characteristic peaks at 1253 cm 1 could be attributed to the vibration of the cn bond in the aromatic amines and the doublet peaks at 3455 and 3297 cm 1 resulted from the amine moieties confirming the presence of 2 aminoterephthalate anions in nh2 mil 101 fe 51 52 fig 1 e shows the dependence of zeta potentials of mil 101 fe and nh2 mil 101 fe on the ph value it is very evident that the isoelectric points of both mofs adsorbents were approximately equivalent 5 0 for nh2 mil 101 fe versus 5 5 for mil 101 fe and the evolution curves were similar implying that the charges of these two particle surfaces were the same under certain ph value in other words the variation between these two mofs based adsorbents for electrostatic interactions with one specific antibiotic can be neglectable fig 1 f showed that the bet surface area of nh2 mil 101 fe was significantly lower than the one of mil 101 fe 501 m2 g versus 1006 m2 g accordingly the pore volume and the mean pore size for the former were also lower than the latter 0 21 cm3 g versus 0 14 cm3 g and 2 8 nm versus 2 5 nm based on the aforementioned results the possible adsorption mechanism of two prepared mofs based adsorbents with antibiotics is analyzed for the target analytes i e antibiotics fig 2 a to c illustrated that the ph values of all antibiotic containing aqueous solutions located in the range of 5 7 to 7 1 with the increase of the solution concentration from 20 mg l to 100 mg l and the solution temperature from 25 c to 45 c furthermore the charge characteristics of these three antibiotics tc tmp and smz in aqueous solutions as a function of ph are depicted in fig 2 d by combining fig 2 d with fig 2 e it can be found that both the adsorbents and the target pollutants have negative surface charges in the ph range 5 7 7 1 light purple boxes in fig 1 e and d and the tc in aqueous solution exhibits the strongest negative charge in this sense electrostatic interactions are playing a negative effect on the antibiotic removal using two prepared mofs based adsorbents and tc with the largest negative charge is least preferable under the current situation also the pore filling effect related to specific surface area and pore volume is one critical factor affecting antibiotic adsorption the larger the specific surface area and pore volume of absorbents the stronger the pore filling effect which resulted in superior adsorption fig 1 f showed that the bet surface area of nh2 mil 101 fe was significantly lower than the one of mil 101 fe 501 m2 g versus 1006 m2 g accordingly the pore volume and the mean pore size for the former were also lower than the latter 0 21 cm3 g versus 0 14 cm3 g and 2 8 nm versus 2 5 nm thus merely relying on the pore filling effect nh2 mil 101 fe with lower specific surface area and pore parameters was less suitable to adsorb and remove some target pollutants i e antibiotics compared to mil 101 fe if the antibiotic adsorption with mil 101s was governed by the electrostatic interaction and the pore filling effect it is very obvious that nh2 mil 101 fe and tc should be the worst couple and the adsorption of nh2 mil 101 fe with the other two antibiotics was not comparable with mil 101 fe however the adsorption between mil 101s and antibiotics was also affected by other three adsorption mechanisms including coordination bonds π π interaction and h bonding therefore the possible deviation between current theoretical prediction and experimental results could be explained by the influence of these three mechanisms on the adsorption 3 2 selective adsorption of mil 101s with antibiotics in this section a series of adsorption experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of adsorption conditions on the adsorption between mil 101s and three representative antibiotics tc smz and tmp based on experimental results and theoretical calculation the possible adsorption mechanism was further analyzed and some evidence was expected to provide an intrinsic explanation of why the membrane pre concentration stage was prerequisite in the context of antibiotic containing sewage wastewater treatment 3 2 1 effects of adsorption time on adsorption performance commonly chemical adsorption is one selective adsorption operation however physical adsorption is non selective more significantly the adsorption for the latter is usually unstable and the desorption occurs during the operation thus adsorption time is one direct and simple index to judge whether the adsorption process is governed by chemical adsorption or not fig 3 a illustrates the antibiotic adsorption capacity of mil 101s as a function of the antibiotic type and the adsorption time for tc it can be found that the antibiotic adsorption amounts of both mofs based adsorbents increased with the increase of the adsorption time and reached the peak value at 18 h red and black lines in the yz projection however the adsorption capacity for both tmp and smz had a peak value with the adsorption time significantly differentiating from the adsorption behavior for tc and indirectly showing that the adsorption process was physically dominated moreover the adsorption kinetics model was used to understand the adsorption pathway of mil 101s and tc as illustrated in supporting information supplementary note 1 the adsorption of tc on two prepared mil 101s is well fitted by the pseudo second order model implying that the adsorption is mainly governed by chemical interaction in addition several adsorption mechanisms including coordination bonds π π interaction electrostatic interaction hydrogen bonds and pore filling effect have been used to elucidate observed adsorption behavior between mofs and antibiotics the open metal size of mil 101s and oxygenous nitrogenous groups from tc smz tmp provide the possibility to form coordination bonds positively beneficial to adsorption also π π interaction hydrogen bonds and pore filling effect are playing positive roles in adsorption however electrostatic repulsion occurs between mil 101s and antibiotics because both surfaces are negatively charged and tc with a larger negative charge certainly leads to strong electrostatic repulsion therefore the electrostatic repulsion and other weak attraction effects are responsible for the desorption of smz and tmp which is corresponding to the simulated results in table 2 and the initial decrease of tmp and smz in the solution can be attributed to the pore filling effect but very weaker interaction or strong repulsion between tmp smz and mil 101s make them diffuse back to the solution as a consequence mil 101 fe with a larger specific surface area and pore volume adsorbed more smz and tmp at the initial stage however the desorption of tc did not happen despite stronger electrostatic repulsion between tc and mil 101s furthermore one closer observation revealed that the adsorption of tc on nh2 mil 101 fe was far stronger than mil 101 fe which was opposite to the situation of mil 101s in the pore filling effect such result indicates that the pore filling effect is not a key factor affecting the adsorption capacity of mil 101s for tc which can also be explained by the intra particle diffusion model as illustrated in fig s5 supporting information the adsorption process was not only governed by intra diffusion and affected by other adsorption effects in detail tc diffused more freely inside nh2 mil 101 fe than mil 101 fe and the former one was more significantly affected by the boundary layer taken together other potential adsorption effects should have played a more significant role resulting in stronger interactions between adsorbents and target pollutants recent studies revealed that the adsorption between mil 101 fe and tc could be affected by hydrogen bonding interactions 53 but the amino group in nh2 mil 101 fe was inclined to form strong hydrogen bonds with hydroxyl groups in the target molecules 54 as illustrated in fig 3 b the bandwidth of nh and oh groups broadens and the corresponding intensity is enlarged after the adsorption of mil 101s with antibiotics suggesting the formation of h bonding also fig 3 c and d demonstrated the presence of the h bonding interaction between tmp or smz and mil 101s but the band intensities of mil 101s after adsorbed with tmp and smz are weaker than the one for tc reflecting the weaker h bonding interaction in addition the strong polar antibiotics with the lower log k ow are more preferable to be removed by using mil 101s corresponding to the h bonding induced efficient extraction of bisphenols and their derivatives using mil 101s 54 furthermore it is well known that the hydrogen bonding effect is a relatively weak interaction compared to chemical bonding i e covalent bonding but the numerous h bond acceptors and donors in tc facilitate the formation of the multi effect h bond interaction causing the strong interaction of mil 101s and tc and showing the similar adsorption behavior with chemical adsorption as shown in fig 3 a meanwhile there are two hydrogen atoms in the h bond donor of nh2 providing more opportunities to form the h bond and enhancing the adsorption capacity 55 such result can also be demonstrated by the more negative value of ebd between nh2 mil 101 fe and tc compared with mil 101 fe 173 kj mol vs 142 kj mol as shown in table 2 in this point tc in the livestock sewage containing these three antibiotics can be selectively removed when the retention time is larger than the desorption time of smz tmp from mil 101s 3 2 2 effects of adsorbent dosage on adsorption performance in this section the average adsorption rate rt m c and the variation of the corresponding average adsorption rate induced by the adsorbent dosage m were used to determine the optimal adsorbent dosage it should be noted that rt m c is determined by the maximum adsorption amount and corresponding adsorption time eq 2 in detail the adsorption times of mil 101s for tc tmp and smz are 18 h 6 h and 4 h respectively as illustrated in fig 4 a all rt m c declined with the increase of the adsorbent dosage which can be caused by two possible situations as shown in fig 5 1st possible situation the antibiotic amount is so far less than the adsorbent dosage that the redundant adsorbent has no opportunity to adsorb the antibiotics in water under 2nd possible situation the antibiotic cannot be fully removed when the adsorbent dosage is at one low level i e 5 mg but when the adsorbent dosage is increased to one higher level i e 10 mg an additional 5 mg mofs is enough to completely remove the remaining antibiotics in other words if 5 mg mofs can be viewed as one adsorbent unit other adsorbent units at higher than 5 mg adsorbent dosage are wasting their adsorption abilities for 5 mg mofs increasing the antibiotic concentration is one simple and feasible method to eliminate the aforementioned doubt this is because increasing antibiotic concentration under 1st possible situation results in a larger adsorption capacity but it is useless to enhance the adsorption efficiency under 2nd possible situation the results showed that when the initial antibiotic concentration increased to 120 mg l rt m c is approximately equal to the one for 100 mg l implying that the minimal adsorbent dosage 5 mg is still far larger than the required dosage for the current antibiotic concentration 100 mg l thus the decline in rt m c can be explained by 1st situation illustrated in fig 5 also fig 4 b illustrates the dependence of m on the adsorbent dosage it can be found that all m is negative and m approaches zero with the increase of adsorbent dosage implying that the increased adsorbent dosage 5 mg is unbeneficial to enhance the absorption rate thus the adsorbent dosage is set to 5 mg in the following sections 3 2 3 effects of initial antibiotic concentration on adsorption performance for certain adsorbent dosages too high or too low initial antibiotic concentration means that the antibiotics cannot be fully removed or the adsorbent is wasting its adsorption capacity moreover the interaction between tc and mofs based adsorbent becomes weaker when the adsorption layer number is larger than 1 potentially resulting in decreased adsorption efficiency thus there should be an optimal match for the adsorption between the mofs based adsorbent and the antibiotics in an aqueous solution fig 6 illustrates the functions of average adsorption rates rt m c and corresponding variations induced by initial antibiotic concentration c with initial tc concentration both rt m c for tc and two mofs based adsorbent increase with the increase of initial tc concentration in other words a high initial tc concentration is beneficial to enhance the adsorption rate when the adsorbent is sufficient for tc highlighting the significance to enhance the antibiotic concentration in water in addition c firstly increased and then began to decrease at about 40 mg l of initial tc concentration the presence of the turning point indirectly suggests that the multi layer adsorption occurs when the initial tc concentration is higher than 40 mg l since the adsorption force decreases gradually with the adsorption layer from inside to outside according to the theory of polanyi adsorption potential in addition the adsorption isotherm was utilized to distinguish between multilayer and monolayer adsorption as analyzed in supporting information the adsorption between tc and mil 101s can be better described by the langmuir model however it should be noted that the adsorption data well fitted by the langmuir model could not support the conclusion that the adsorption was governed by monolayer adsorption behavior especially when the pore diameter of the adsorbent was 2 3 nm based on such consideration the adsorption layer number is approximately estimated by n s tc θs mofs where θ is the surface coverage smofs stc is the total surface area of mofs and adsorbed tc as illustrated in table s3 it can be found that when the surface coverage is 0 84 the adsorption layers of tc onto both mil 101s are more than a monolayer and although the surface coverage approaches 1 tc adsorbed onto nh2 mil 101 fe is governed by multi layer adsorption behavior the 100 or relatively high surface coverage cannot occur in the actual solid liquid adsorption system due to the interaction and steric hindrance of different tc molecules therefore the adsorption layers of tc onto these two mil 101s are very likely to be multi layer at this point even though increased initial tc concentration resulted in a higher adsorption rate the concentration induced adsorption efficiency began to decrease at a certain concentration 40 mg l for tc also one closer observation revealed that the turning point for the adsorption between nh2 mil 101 fe and tc came early than mil 101 fe this is because lower surface area and stronger interaction for the former make the adsorbent surface quicker filled by tc however the same behavior cannot be found in the adsorption between mil 101s and the other two antibiotics fig s3 also fig s4 illustrates that maximum adsorption amounts of mil 101s for tmp and smz increase linearly with initial antibiotic concentration all r2 0 97 and the intercept is fixed to zero indirectly demonstrating that initial adsorption behaviors of mil 101s for tmp and smz in fig 3 a are mainly governed by the pore filling effect therefore the initial tc concentration is set to 40 mg l for maximum adsorption efficiency and the same initial concentrations of tmp and smz 40 mg l were selected concerning their potential negative influence on the adsorption of tc onto mil 101s 3 2 4 effect of adsorption temperature on adsorption performance according to the thermodynamics of the adsorption process the adsorption capacity for physical adsorption decreased with the increased adsorption temperature because of negative adsorption heat however the adsorption capacity for chemical adsorption showed the first increase and then decreased trend because of the existence of activation energy if the input energy namely low operation temperature was less than the activation energy the adsorption capacity increased with increased temperature otherwise the desorption occurred at higher adsorption temperatures thereby rendering decreased adsorption capacity fig 7 a illustrates the evolution of the adsorption between two prepared mofs based adsorbents nh2 mil 101 fe and mil 101 fe and three different antibiotics tc tmp and smz at different adsorption temperatures the adsorption behavior of both mofs based adsorbents for tmp and smz show the characteristics of physical adsorption however higher adsorption capacity for tc can be found at higher adsorption temperatures differentiating from the situation for tmp and smz this is because the strong interaction between mofs based adsorbents and tc makes their adsorption show similar behavior with chemical adsorption which is in good agreement with the aforementioned analysis more significantly fig 7 b illustrates the dependence of the ratio of the adsorption capacity for tc to the one for tmp or smz on the adsorption temperature it can be seen that both qe tc qe tmp and qe tc qe smz increase with the increase of the adsorption temperature implying that higher adsorption temperature can cause a more significant difference between tc and tmp or smz in the adsorption capacities of these two mofs based adsorbents in addition one closer observation reveals that using nh2 mil 101 fe as the adsorbent can achieve more superiorly selective adsorption for tc and the other two antibiotics compared to mil 101 fe for instance qe tc qe tmp and qe tc qe smz at 25 c are 1 75 and 1 55 by using mil 101 fe while the ones increase to 2 38 and 2 13 by using nh2 mil 101 fe the same situation can also be found at higher adsorption temperatures therefore a high adsorption temperature is preferable for the selective separation of these three antibiotics in water and 45 c was used as the optimal adsorption temperature in the following section 3 2 5 selective adsorption and reusability of mofs based adsorbents for antibiotics in the solution containing three antibiotics tc smz and tmp two mofs based adsorbents mil 101 fe and nh2 mil 101 fe were used to investigate their selective adsorption for tc as illustrated in fig 3 a the desorption behavior occurred after 4 h for tmp and smz but the adsorption effect for tc was still strengthened at this time thus the adsorption time is one critical parameter to present the evolution of selective adsorption fig 8 shows the dependence of the selectivity coefficient of mofs based adsorbent for tc on the adsorption time the selective coefficients for both mofs based adsorbents increased with the increase of adsorption time this is because the adsorption amount for smz and tmp became decreased when the adsorption time was longer than 4 h fig 8 also revealed that selective coefficients of mil 101 fe were higher than 70 while nh2 mil 101 fe showed more superior selective adsorption for tc 85 more significantly the selective coefficient of nh2 mil 101 fe can reach up to 95 at 24 h in this sense using mil 101 fe as the adsorbent can effectively remove tc from the aqueous solution containing tc tmp and smz considering the low concentration of antibiotics in an actual aqueous system high efficiently concentrating the antibiotic containing aqueous solution with low energy consumption is of significance and will be discussed in the following section in addition the reusability of two prepared mofs based adsorbents was investigated concerning their economic availability as illustrated in fig 9 the adsorption capacity decreased gradually with the increase of the cycle number which might be attributed to the physical chemical structure damage of mofs based adsorbent during the multi stage regeneration process however the adsorption capacities of two adsorbents still reached up to 90 of the original ones after 4th adsorption experiment therefore even though the current regeneration method can sacrifice the adsorption capacity to some extent the adsorption performance is still located at a high level 3 3 membrane pre concentration experiments with low energy consumption the fo process without the ds regeneration can be viewed as one low energy consumption membrane separation process based on such consideration kcl one representative fertilizer was used as the solute of ds thereby rendering that diluted ds could be used for agricultural fertigation meanwhile tc smz tmp three representative antibiotics were used as the solutes of fs and the actual fo performance was governed by both intrinsic membrane properties and operating conditions therefore one commercially available fo membrane was firstly used to investigate the effects of some operation conditions including temperature difference fertilizer concentration and the antibiotic type and concentration on its perm selective performance water flux forward antibiotic flux and reverse k flux 3 3 1 fo without ds generation antibiotic concentration and fertilizer dilution high water permeation and low solute leakage are highly required at the membrane pre concentration stage therefore fig 10 illustrates the evolution of the water flux the reverse k flux and the forward antibiotic tc flux with the fs concentration the ds concentration and operating temperature difference it can be found that higher water flux occurs at higher ds concentration lower fs concentration and higher temperature difference resulting from higher osmotic pressure difference or driving force across the membrane and higher pure water permeability coefficient antibiotic concentration and fertilizer dilution at the membrane pre concentration stage will cause a continuous reduction in water flux considering that antibiotics in aqueous solutions could not cause severe membrane fouling compared with other foulants in actual antibiotics containing wastewater 56 57 the driving force osmotic pressure attenuation resulting from the decrease in the concentration difference across the membrane should be responsible for the aforementioned water flux decline behavior for instance the water flux at cf1 and cd3 was 20 30 lmh but the one at cf3 and cd1 had decreased to 8 36 lmh by 58 82 such water flux evolution behavior is unbeneficial to achieving high concentration and dilution efficiency to mitigate reverse k leakage higher kcl concentration and temperature difference are not preferable this is because reverse k flux is governed by the solute permeability coefficient and the concentration difference js b c and the former is positively related to the temperature 58 also the tc concentration on the fs side affects the k diffusion thereby rendering enhanced fertilizer leakage it can be seen that this effect was relatively weak at the low temperature difference but the effect was strengthened at the high temperature difference which can be attributed to the donnan dialysis 59 as schematically depicted in fig 11 in detail when the fs concentration was increased as shown in the right part of fig 11 more tc diffused through the membrane from the fs side to the ds side due to higher concentration difference in addition fig 2 a revealed that the coupled ion in tc solution was h because the solution was weak acid the additional diffusion of tc changes original solution electroneutrality in the fs and ds sides respectively accordingly more coupled h and reverse cl have high probability to transport through the membrane so as to achieve new solution electroneutrality as a consequence more k also diffuses from ds to fs this behavior becomes more significant at high temperature difference due to the fact that high temperature is responsible for high solute diffusion across the membrane based on aforementioned analysis low temperature difference is conducive to mitigating k leakage sacrificing water permeation efficiency fig 10 also shows that the forward tc flux was strongly affected by the temperature difference the tc concentration and the kcl concentration the effect mechanism of the first two operation conditions on forward tc diffusion can be described by the sd model according to the sd model increased tc concentration difference and membrane solute permeability certainly result in more tc diffusion from the feed side to the ds side in addition the donnan dialysis can also be used to illuminate the mechanism of the kcl concentration on forward tc flux as shown in the left part of fig 11 increased kcl concentration on the ds side means high reverse k diffusion then the solution electroneutrality necessitates the further diffusion of cl and h as the original orientation under such a scenario more tc transports through the membrane and enters into the ds similar to the reverse k diffusion the forward tc diffusion also suffers from a high temperature difference in detail at the high temperature difference both the initial solution configuration high kcl concentration and low tc concentration and final solution configuration decreased kcl concentration and increased tc concentration are shown to not mitigate the solute leakage but enhance the solute diffusion therefore although the high temperature difference is preferable for water flux severe solute leakage confined the fo based pre concentration process at the low temperature difference based on the aforementioned analysis the final concentration for these three antibiotics in the membrane pre concentration stage had better not be higher than 40 mg l to obtain the optimal adsorption efficiency in the subsequent adsorption stage furthermore the final fertilizer solution needs to be diluted to one lower concentration 1 m in this section thus the fo performances for the pre concentration of three antibiotics were compared under conditions of 1 m kcl as the ds and 40 mg l antibiotics as the fs and was depicted in fig 12 both forward antibiotic and reverse k diffusions should be mitigated to some extent and pure water was expected to transport more across the membrane as shown in fig 12 a tc at different operation temperature differences is easier to diffuse through the used commercial tfc fo membrane compared to the other three solutes tmp smz and k which is unbeneficial to the selective adsorption for tc in addition the ratio of the sum of forward antibiotic and reverse k fluxes to water flux can be denoted as specific reverse solute flux srsf was used to evaluate the perm selective performance of fo membranes by incorporating the water flux the less the srsf the more pure water is through the membrane than the solutes fig 12 b illustrates the combination between tc and k results in more solute leakage per unit water flux compared to the other two combinations this may be because the strong h bonding interaction between tc and h2o facilitates the conjunct diffusion of water molecules and tc through the membrane therefore tc tmp and smz can be concentrated in fo but high tc and k leakage adversely affect the concentration efficiency at this point the leakage for the target solute in fo limits its application in the current separation system furthermore the water flux in fo is strongly dependent on the concentration difference between fs and ds thus continuous fs concentration and ds dilution in fo also sacrifice the water flux and the concentration efficiency taken together fo technology should not be viewed as the first choice to treat antibiotics containing wastewater and achieve agricultural fertigation 3 3 2 an alternative pathway temperature enhanced osmotic membrane distillation the above mentioned discussion evokes one question there is an alternative pathway to concentrate antibiotic wastewater and simultaneously dilute fertilizer solution in our previous study temperature enhanced osmotic membrane distillation t omd had demonstrated to ensure higher water flux and lower fertilizer loss at high temperature differences than fo 60 based on such situation t omd is expected to mitigate severe antibiotic and fertilizer leakage in fo in t omd the water flux is less susceptible to the tc concentration and kcl concentration 43 17 47 33 lmh and water fluxes in t omd are larger than the ones in fo under the same conditions as illustrated in fig 13 a potentially implying that the more stable and higher water flux occurred in t omd also figs 13 b and 13 c show that fertilizer and antibiotic leakage can be effectively mitigated in t omd for instance the forward tc flux and the reverse k flux in t omd have decreased to 0 07 0 45 and 0 04 0 38 of the ones in fo higher water flux and lower solute leakage are responsible for the superior perm selectivity performance in t omd as shown in fig 13 d for instance the ratio of the srsf in t omd to the one in fo ranges from 0 04 to 0 24 suggesting that 99 76 solute leakage can be avoided in t omd more significantly the higher temperature for the concentrated antibiotic containing fs stream discharging from t omd is beneficial to enhance the adsorption efficiency in the subsequent adsorption stage thereby weakening the economic consideration about high thermal input for heating the fs steam therefore t omd can provide an alternative membrane based option to high efficiently remove antibiotics in livestock sewerage and simultaneously achieve agricultural fertigation 3 4 preliminary energy consumption analyses for standalone adsorption system and membrane pre concentration and adsorption hybrid system referring to fig 6 the ratio of the adsorption rate at 40 mg l to the one at 5 mg l is located in the range of 10 12 depending on the adsorbent type in this section the adsorption ratio was selected as 12 under the same adsorption process configuration and antibiotic removal amount number 12 represents the antibiotics containing feed stream that enters the adsorption stage more than a dozen times in addition the initial tc concentration is supposed to be 5 mg l and q and its concentration can be concentrated to 40 mg l after the membrane pre concentration stage accordingly the initial feed flowrate is fixed at 8q and the stream flowrate after the membrane pre concentration stage decreased to q based on these assumptions the standalone adsorption and hybrid systems are shown in fig 14 the energy consumption in the standalone adsorption system results mainly from the pump and can be expressed by es pre 12 wt 8q p η in this equation pre is the electricity price wt is the referenced working time in the hybrid system p is the hydraulic pressure and η is the pump efficiency in addition if the thermal energy is easily accessible and its cost can be neglected the energy in the hybrid system is also mainly consumed in the pump and can be estimated by the following equation as eh pre wt 8 1 q p η pre wt 9q p η the ratio of es to eh can reach up to 32 3 which means that up to 90 63 of energy can be saved via incorporating the membrane pre concentration stage what s more one universal equation can be used to build the relationship between energy consumption in these systems es eh m n 1 n in this equation m represents the ratio of the adsorption rate at concentrated feed concentration to the one at initial feed concentration and n represents the concentration multiple it should be noted that m is positively related to n therefore es eh increases significantly with increased concentration multiple 3 5 potential implication of membrane pre concentration and adsorption hybrid system to high efficiently remove antibiotics in livestock sewerage and simultaneously achieve agricultural fertigation the membrane pre concentration process i e fo or t omd 1st mofs based selective adsorption process and 2nd adsorption biodegradation process was integrated and illustrated in fig 15 after the solid liquid separation process to remove some solid state organisms in livestock sewage not mentioned in fig 15 the antibiotics containing sewage was subsequently delivered into the membrane pre concentration stage in which the antibiotics containing sewage was used as the fs and the high concentration fertilizer solution was used as the ds in this stage the water can transfer from the fs side to the ds side as a consequence the concentration of antibiotics in fs increased while the high concentration fertilizer solution was diluted it should be noted that all membranes are not 100 solute rejection thus the forward and reverse solute diffusions are two critical indexes to evaluate whether the membrane process can minimize fertilizer loss and antibiotic leakage then the diluted fertilizer solution can be delivered to the fertilizer supply station and concentrated livestock sewage entered the mofs based adsorption stage in which the antibiotics can be selectively and effectively removed by the adsorption interaction between mofs and specific antibiotics the remaining antibiotics can be removed in the subsequent adsorption biodegradation stage which has been involved in the reported study and thus is not discussed in this work finally the product water without antibiotics can be used to further dilute the fertilizer solution concerning the demand for crop growth or as the water utilization in the livestock industry based on the such design conventional livestock and plant farming industries can be seamlessly combined by achieving the high efficient utilization of water resources furthermore the products from the farmland i e soybean can be used as feedstuff in the livestock industry while the animal excrement can be used as fertilizer in the farmland taken together the proposed hybrid system is beneficial to achieve the sustainable development of the livestock and plant farming industries by the dual recycling pathway for the water and nutrient fertilizer resources 4 concluding remarks in this work one membrane pre concentration and mof based selective adsorption hybrid system was proposed to high efficiently and selectively remove antibiotics in livestock sewerage and simultaneously achieve agricultural fertigation the main conclusions can be drawn as the following 1 two common mofs based materials mil 101 fe and nh2 mil 101 fe were used as the adsorbents to remove the antibiotics in water adsorption experiments showed that two distinct different adsorption behaviors occurred for using two mil 101s to remove three representative antibiotics tc smz and tmp in livestock sewerage potentially resulting from stronger h bonding interaction and larger h bond number between tc and mil 101s the adsorption capacity was strongly related to the adsorption time with the increase of the adsorption time the adsorption capacity for tc increased to a constant and maximum value but the one for smz and tmp showed a first increased and then decreased trend for certain adsorbent dosages there was one optimal initial antibiotic concentration i e 40 mg l for tc corresponding to 5 mg mil 101s to obtain maximum adsorption efficiency highlighting the significance to enhance the antibiotic concentration and determining the final concentration in the membrane pre concentration stage also a high adsorption temperature was preferable for the selective separation of tc from the wastewater containing these three antibiotics when the adsorption time ranged from 12 h to 24 h selective coefficients of mil 101 fe were higher than 70 however nh2 mil 101 fe showed superior selective adsorption for tc 85 especially the selective coefficient of nh2 mil 101 fe for tc could reach up to 95 at 24 h therefore using nh2 mil 101 fe as the adsorbent could effectively remove tc from the aqueous solution containing tc tmp and smz and preferable operation conditions i e high adsorption temperature and suitably high antibiotic concentration necessitated the thermal input and the membrane pre concentration process 2 membrane pre concentration experiments showed that tc tmp and smz could be concentrated in fo but high tc and k leakage adversely affected the concentration efficiency furthermore water flux in fo was strongly dependent on the concentration difference between fs and ds thus the water flux decline was inevitable in fo taken together fo technology should not be viewed as the first choice to treat antibiotics containing wastewater and achieve agricultural fertigation potential problems of the fo technology and the intrinsic demand of the selective adsorption process initiated the application of t omd the experimental result showed that the water flux was less susceptible to the tc and kcl concentration 43 17 47 33 lmh and was larger than the ones in fo under the same conditions fertilizer and antibiotic leakage were effectively mitigated in t omd where 99 76 solute leakage could be avoided therefore t omd could provide an alternative membrane based option to high efficiently remove antibiotics in livestock sewerage and simultaneously achieve agricultural fertigation declaration of competing interest the authors declare

12778,industrial sulfuric acid wastewater treatment using vacuum membrane distillation vmd technology has attracted worldwide attention however high energy loss and low membrane flux seriously hinder the industrialization of vmd technology this paper novelly introduced an entransy theory to improve the vmd system performance mathematical models were built and verified via an experimental setup

always an indispensable resource for preserving the humanity s survival and development the demand for fresh water is growing exponentially with the continuous increase in global population industrialization and modernization accordingly fresh water production methods and the corresponding devices have attracted widespread attentions all over the world recently recovery and utilization of industrial wastewater in particular the sulfuric acid wastewater has been identified as one of the sustainable solutions to obtain fresh water 1 3 membrane distillation md is an emerging and promising separation technology that has been studied in several application fields including wastewater treatment desalination medicine concentration and food processing 4 in an md process a microporous hydrophobic membrane is selected as a barrier to allow only the vapors to reach the permeate side across the membrane pores which achieves the solution s concentration and purification considering the condensation form of vapor in the vacuum side various md configurations have been developed over the past decades 5 8 1 direct contact membrane distillation in which both sides of the hydrophobic membrane are in direct contact with the liquid phase 2 air gap membrane distillation in which a certain amount of air gap exists between the hydrophobic membrane surface and condensation surface 3 sweeping gas membrane distillation in which the inert gas is employed to sweep away the vapor 4 vacuum membrane distillation vmd in which the vapor is extracted directly using a vacuum system thereinto the vmd has the largest permeate flux among these configurations due to the larger driving pressure difference on two sides of membrane caused by the applied negative environment in the vacuum side wastewater treatment for the production of fresh water has been considered as a typical application considered in vmd research many studies and attempts on the use of vmd technology in wastewater treatment fields have been performed nie 9 focused on the application of vmd for the treatment of low level radioactive wastewater containing uranium the research results indicated that a permeate flux of 11 3 l m 2 h 1 and a separation efficiency of 99 99 were obtained when using the simulated wastewater as feed li 10 introduced a novel multi effect vmd system to treat hypersaline water and revealed the mass and heat transfer mechanism of condensation convection distillation within the entire process more importantly such hybrid system required less energy compared to a conventional single effect system zhang 11 developed a vmd experimental device in which the membrane material was selected as polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe with strong corrosion to evaporate the sulfuric acid solution as the main result a separation efficiency of 100 was achieved in the evaporation process obviously vmd technology has shown an excellent separation effect regardless of whether a salt solution or sulfuric acid solution is used however due to the polarization phenomenon membrane fouling membrane wetting the lack of appropriate membrane materials the lack of heat recovery devices and other factors the existing vmd devices have the poor operation stability lower thermal efficiency and permeate flux which have seriously hindered the further industrial application of the vmd technology therefore a large number of scholars have established heat and mass transfer models according to the structural type of vmd module and extensive investigations to enhance the performance of the vmd system have been done via both numerical simulation and experiments firstly the influence mechanism of membrane characteristic parameters such as membrane thickness membrane pore tortuosity factor porosity as well as membrane length on the vmd process has been deeply investigated to find ways to improve its performance mendez 12 studied the effects of membrane characteristic parameters on permeate flux in the vmd process it was revealed that increasing porosity and decreasing tortuosity factor and membrane thickness could effectively increase the permeate flux suga 13 experimentally investigated the effects of membrane characteristic parameters on the long term operation stability of the vmd process in addition the influence of operation parameters on the vmd process should also be considered helen 14 investigated the impacts from key factors on the mass transfer and membrane fouling in the vmd process for inland brine water treatment experimental results presented that transverse vibration could effectively promote mass transfer mittal 15 established an artificial neural network aiming to obtain the influence laws of operation parameters with vacuum side pressure feed concentration and feed temperature included on membrane fouling in the vmd process which was helpful to find the optimum operating conditions yielding the maximum permeate flux the modification of vmd module structure is also an effective method to enhance the vmd process performance and the alternative ways mainly include the following 16 19 1 developing new and efficient membrane materials 2 changing the arrangement of the membrane tube 3 coating nanostructured materials on the membrane surface 4 changing the morphology of membrane tube moreover special attention has been paid to the operation process improvement all over the world min 20 found that membrane fouling was inhibited to a certain extent by adding a cleaning agent and a scale inhibitor to the md module so as to improve the permeate flux li 21 used bubbling to produce a two phase flow in the vmd process which increased the turbulence degree of the solution and decreased the boundary layer resistance on the hot side resulting in water production improvement and membrane fouling control a huge amount of energy is necessary to achieve the evaporation and concentration of the feed liquid in the vmd process in order to satisfy the energy requirements the relevant methods of energy efficiency improvement have been proposed and developed in recent decades boutikos 22 developed a multi effect vmd system in view of the latent heat recovery principle of multi effect evaporation process and the specific energy consumption was gained as 250 kwh t 1 when the feed temperature was set to 353 15 k however due to the complex process and low vapor temperature the improvement of recovery efficiency of latent heat is limited kim 23 studied a hybrid system of solar and vmd by combining experiment and simulation the minimum specific energy consumption was found to be 220 kwh t 1 sarbatly 24 tried to introduce the geothermal energy into the vmd process and the highest flux was obtained as 9 28 kg m 2 h 1 under feed flow rate of 33 2 l h 1 and vacuum side pressure of 30 kpa and the corresponding specific energy consumption was attained as 66 03 kw kg 1 h 1 zhang 25 suggested a vmd system with a heat pump cycle coupled aiming to provide heating source for the vmd process by using heat pump energy saving technology experimental results showed that the system consumed 0 3 t of fresh vapor for each 1 t of water evaporated si 26 introduced a mechanical vapor recompression mvr technology into the vmd process in view of the self heat recuperation theory with the objective of recovering and reusing the vapor s latent heat it was verified that the energy efficiency of vmd was significantly improved and the specific energy consumption was shown to be 81 95 kwh t 1 as we all know a vmd system involves a heat transfer process which mainly includes convective heat transfer across the boundary layer evaporation of liquid water at the membrane surface heat conduction across the membrane and vapor condensation by cooling water the irreversibility of the whole heat transfer process will inevitably lead to a large amount of heat dissipation entransy theory 27 is a novel concept that properly describes the heat transfer ability of objects and such ability in the transfer process may be reduced therefore it can reflect the irreversibility of heat transfer process and can be introduced to analyze and optimize the thermodynamic system similar to the transfer of an electric current in a conductor and fluid flow in a pipe heat transfer in the medium is an irreversible process generally speaking the current passing through a conductor needs to consume electrical energy to overcome resistance while a fluid in a pipe needs to consume mechanical energy to overcome fluid resistance accordingly the heat flow in the medium will inevitably consume thermal potential energy to overcome thermal resistance so as to achieve the heat transfer process thus the loss of thermal potential energy caused by overcoming thermal resistance is defined as entransy dissipation chen 28 tried to combine the entropy theory and entransy theory to design and optimize the convective heat transfer process li et al 29 applied the entransy theory to optimize the serrated fin in the plate fin heat exchanger in their work the impacts from the geometrical parameters of heat exchanger on entransy dissipation thermal resistance that resulted from heat transfer and fluid friction were revealed by using numerical simulation and experiment moreover optimal results based on the multi objective function considering the entransy dissipation thermal resistance were also obtained from the above literature survey it can be generalized that despite a large number of extensive and in depth researches focusing on various aspects such as feasibility water production as well as energy consumption of the vmd system the research gap of the current vmd system is obvious the mechanism model of heat and mass transfer is not perfect and the energy efficiency still remains at a lower level owing to the larger irreversibility resulted from the heat and mass transfer resistance the entransy theory which properly describes the irreversibility and heat transfer capability and is more universal and accordant with the requirements of optimizing vmd system however the entransy dissipation concept has not been considered to explore the potential improvements of the vmd system in the present paper the mathematical models were firstly built in the light of the mass and heat conservation as well as entransy theory then the separation performance and entransy dissipation performance were investigated based on the obtained experimental data from a vmd experimental setup finally the influence mechanism of critical operation parameters including feed concentration feed temperature feed velocity as well as vacuum side pressure on entransy dissipation performance in the vmd system were investigated the investigation methods and results lay a significant foundation to optimize the vmd system 2 theory the principle chart of the vmd system is presented in fig 1 containing the vmd module feed pump vacuum pump condenser feed tank and distilling tank included a sulfuric acid solution stored in the feed tank in advance is preheated to a required temperature via an electrical heater and then pumped into the lumen side of module using a feed pump while a negative environment is applied to the shell side of the module using a vacuum pump the liquid water evaporates on the membrane surface of the lumen side and diffuses to the shell side driven by the pressure difference the generated vapors are then condensed in the condenser via the cooling water and stored in the distilling tank the concentrated solution goes back into the feed tank and is further concentrated to reach the desired concentration the involved thermal processes are shown in fig 2 the 1 3 stands for the evaporation process of water molecule within the vmd module and the 3 4 stands for the condensation process of vapor molecule within the condenser the detailed schematic for heat and mass transfer within the vmd system is depicted in fig 3 the mathematical models are built to simulate and analyze the system performance with mass conservation energy conservation and entransy theory considered and the reasonable assumptions are given by 30 1 the system operates in the steady state conditions 2 the heat transfer between the system and environment is not considered 3 the fouling resistance and pressure loss in the condenser are neglected 4 the pressure drop from the pump and pipes are ignored 5 membrane fouling phenomenon are ignored 2 1 physical properties of the research object the physical properties of the sulfuric acid solution involved in the calculation process mainly consist of density ρ specific heat capacity c p dynamic viscosity μ and thermal conductivity λ which can be obtained in the previous reported literature 31 2 2 vmd module the feed solution is separated into the concentrated solution and vapor through the vmd module accordingly mass transfer together with heat transfer occur simultaneously and the mass and energy conservation equations are obtained as follows 1 m 1 m 2 m 3 2 m 1 x 1 m 2 x 2 3 m 1 h 1 m 2 h 2 m 3 h 3 where x

introduction section entransy theory can be used to analyze the irreversibility of heat transfer process so as to optimize heat transfer process and reduce heat loss in the vmd system therefore the entransy balance equation is established through the entransy analysis of the heat transfer process within the vmd system the vmd process involves a lot of heat and mass transport including the transport process from the bulk solution to the membrane surface through the thermal boundary layer and the transport process of phase change across the membrane thereinto the transport from the bulk solution to the membrane surface is a convective heat transfer process and there is a certain entransy dissipation the relevant entransy balance equation is described as follows 17 ϕ b q b t f t f m q 2 b 2 ρc p v where v is volume flow rate of fluid the phase change process on the membrane surface is the most important part of the whole heat and mass transfer and the vapor generated by the phase change is the membrane flux through the membrane pores the heat transfer process of which includes two parts the heat across the membrane pore in the form of vaporization heat and the heat across the membrane wall in the form of heat conduction since the phase change occurs at the hot side membrane surface the entransy flow caused by the phase change is considered as the input entransy flow on the hot side of membrane as a result the entransy dissipation rate of the vapor carrying latent heat across the membrane pore is shown as 40 18 ϕ v nγ v a m t f m t p the entransy dissipation rate for the heat conduction process across the membrane wall is shown as 19 ϕ c a m 1 ε λ s ελ g t f m t p 2 δ due to the temperature difference between both sides of the membrane there must be entransy dissipation in the heat transfer process across the membrane thus thermal resistance of entransy dissipation arise accordingly which can be divided into the following parts one is the thermal resistance of entransy dissipation for the heat transfer across the membrane pores which can be calculated as follows 20 r v t f m t p q v the other one is the thermal resistance of entransy

the heat loss to the environment and electrical heater power respectively 2 6 single factor analysis model single factor analysis method 43 is defined as when multiple factors affect a variable at the same time the influence of each factor on the variable is studied one by one under the condition that the other factors are set unchanged suppose a set a y 1 y 2 y m with a length of m and a set b x 1 x 2 x n with a length of n the mapping relationship between sets a and b can be constructed as follows 25 y 1 y 2 y m a 11 a 12 a 1 n a 21 a 22 a 2 n a m 1 a m 2 a mn x 1 x 2 x n namely 26 y 1 a 11 x

2 e x n e y m i 1 i 1 n a mi x 1 x i a m 1 x 1 y m e x 1 i 1 i n n a mi x n x i a mn x n y m e x n obviously the relative changes of all the elements in set a is closely related to the relative changes of each element in set b accordingly the single factor analysis method is introduced to investigate the influence of the relative changes of all elements in set a on the relative changes of elements in set b and the above formula can be changed into 29 e y 1 e y 2 e y m b 11 b 12 b 1 n b 21 b 22 b 2 n b m 1 b m 2 b mn e x 1 e x 2 e x n where b mn is expressed as follows 30 b 11 i 1 i 1 n

b mn i 1 i n n a mi x n x i a mn x n y m then e y 1 x 1 e y 1 x 2 e y 1 x n e y 2 x 1 e y 2 x 2 e y 2 x n and e y m x 1 e y m x 2 e y m x n can be defined as the single factor influence values of the relative change of elements in set b on the relative change of elements in set a which can be obtained as follows 31 e y 1 x 1 i 1 i 1 n a 1 i x 1 x i a 11 x 1 y 1 e x 1 e y 1 x n i 1 i n n a 1 i x n

the relative change of element y i 3 experiment to verify the established mathematical models a set of experiments were conducted using a vmd experimental device as shown in fig 4 an electric heater was used to meet the heat requirement of the system the vmd module was composed of several hollow fibers manufactured from polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe material the condenser was utilized to condense the vapor the vacuum pump was employed to create a negative pressure environment for the system the vmd system is a closed cycle system composed of many components which are interdependent and mutually affected due to the characteristics of multi equipment multi process multi state and multi working conditions the operation process is relatively complicated the experiment must be carried out strictly in accordance with the operating flow the detailed operation steps are as follows a ensure that there is enough feed solution in the feed tank open the electrical heater within the feed tank to preheat the feed solution to the set temperature start the feed pump and adjust the control valve to make the feed solution enter the vmd module at a certain flow rate b open the control valve of cooling circulating water and start the vacuum pump to vacuumize c as the experimental conditions are stable observe and record the display number of each instrument regularly to ensure that the liquid level of the feed tank gradually decreases and the liquid level of the distilling tank gradually increases d change the feed concentration feed temperature feed flow rate vacuum side pressure repeat the experiment under various working conditions throughout the experiments all the operation parameters were monitored using a measurement system including thermometer pressure gauge and flow meter which were coated with a high corrosion resistance material the properties of the key components were depicted in table 1 the flow meter with a range of 160 1600 l h 1 and a precision of 2 5 was utilized to test the flow rate of feed solution the pt 100 temperature sensor with a range of 273 373 k and a precision of 1 was utilized to obtain the temperatures of each test point and the probe of which was coated with corrosion resistant tetrafluoron material the pressure sensor with a range of 0 1 0 mpa and a precision of 1 0 was employed to measure the pressures of each test point a conductivity meter with a precision of 2 was employed to measure the liquid conductivity each experiment was required to be repeated at least 3 times aiming to ensure the reproducibility and reliability of the results in addition the system performance parameters such as membrane flux and thermal efficiency can be calculated indirectly with the directly measured physical parameters and the measured data inevitably has errors assuming that the performance parameter y is a function of physical parameters x 1 x 2 x n that can be directly measured the relationship between the standard error of the performance parameter y and each directly measured physical parameter is expressed as follows 35 σy i 1 n y xi 2 4 results and discussion 4 1 experiment research 4 1 1 mathematical models validation here a vmd platform was constructed to obtain the reliable experimental results and validate the mathematical models based on the errors of directly measured physical parameters described in the above section the relative error of the performance parameters for the experimental system can be calculated to be 3 5 which ensured the accuracy of the measurement sensors fig 5 showed the relevant validation results of mathematical models in the following conditions feed concentration x 1 of 2 feed temperature t 1 of 348 0 k and feed velocity v 1 of 1 0 m s 1 it could be seen that the experimental results corresponded very well to the simulated results estimated using the established mathematical models obviously the error bars of each measuring point reported in fig 5 were all below 15 which supported the repeatability of the experiment results the relative error values between the simulated and experimental membrane flux were 5 21 15 07 12 34 14 36 12 14 11 27 and 15 94 when varying the vacuum side pressure p 3 from 8 kpa to 32 kpa in addition table 2 showed the comparison of experimental and simulated membrane fluxes under multiple working conditions the relative errors values between the simulated and experimental values were all within 15 the above relative errors were all within 20 which demonstrated the accuracy of the current built mathematical models 4 1 2 analysis of separation performance for the vmd system table 3 presented the experimental values of each point parameter versus p 3 at the x 1 of 2 t 1 of 348 0 k and v 1 of 1 0 m s 1 the value of p 3 played an important role in the vmd process it was observed that under the effect of p 3 varying from 8 kpa to 32 kpa the membrane flux was obtained with an amplitude drop of 90 5 from 4 0 kg m 2 h 1 to 0 38 kg m 2 h 1 and the temperatures of vapor and concentrated solution increased accordingly the produced vapor was then condensed to normal temperature state in the condenser resulting in the elevation of cooling water temperature less condensate corresponded to the lower cooling water temperature at the heat exchanger outlet similar to the influence from the p 3 the relevant variation laws of water production versus v 1 were also presented in table 4 when x 1 t 1 and p 3 were fixed at 2 353 0 k and 24 kpa respectively in case the v 1 is raised from 0 4 m s 1 to 1 0 m s 1 the membrane flux would be increased due to a better heat and mass transfer in the vmd module a lower concentrated solution temperature and higher vapor temperature would be attained as a result the cooling water temperature at the condenser outlet increased at the fixed mass flow rate at the fixed x 1 of 2 v 1 of 1 0 m s 1 and p 3 of 24 kpa the membrane flux was obviously increased from 0 4 kg m 2 h 1 to 1 98 kg m 2 h 1 with the elevation of t 1 from 338 0 k to 353 0 k and the temperatures of concentrated solution vapor and cooling water were found to be increased accordingly as shown in the table 5 thus it could be inferred that the vmd performance for sulfuric acid solution was very sensitive to the t 1 after verifying the impacts of the values of t 1 v 1 and p 3 on the vmd performance of sulfuric acid solution the value of x 1 is also very critical to investigate such influence accordingly the change of x 1 is selected to focus on the caused variation laws of water production in the vmd process presented in table 6 at the fixed t 1 of 353 0 k v 1 of 1 0 m s 1 and p 3 of 24 kpa it was observed that after the elevation of x 1 from 2 to 14 which indicated the mass and heat transfer process in the vmd module was weakened the membrane flux was reduced from 1 98 kg m 2 h 1 to 1 7 kg m 2 h 1 with a magnitude of 14 14 while the corresponding concentrated solution temperature moved toward the higher direction but the vapor and cooling water temperatures moved toward the lower direction additionally the conductivity of the obtained condensate water was kept within 20 μs cm 1 which was much lower than that of tap water 120 200 μs cm 1 thus utilizing the current vmd module to treat sulfuric acid solution could achieve the high separation efficiency and obtain extremely pure fresh water 4 1 3 analysis of entransy dissipation performance for the vmd system compared with other separation processes the water production performance of the existing vmd system is still not as expected due to the low system energy efficiency thus it is necessary to analyze the energy efficiency of the vmd system the entransy analyze model established in the above section was employed to describe the coupled heat and mass transfer process with the objective of enhancing energy efficiency and reducing energy consumption of the vmd system in the practical vmd system there was always a certain entransy dissipation which could reflect the irreversibility of transport process during the transport process of heat and mass in the vmd system resistance was considered as the cause that turned reversibility into irreversibility therefore thermal resistance based on the entransy dissipation would be employed to analyze the transport mechanism of the vmd system the vmd experiments were carried out under controlled conditions using a built vmd experimental setup and the actual operation data was chosen for the entransy analyses of the vmd process in this analyses x 1 t 1 v 1 and p 3 were fixed at 10 353 0 k 1 0 m s 1 and 24 kpa respectively overall entransy analyze results of the vmd system was presented in table 7 during the experiment an electric heater with a power of 12 kw was used to provide heat to the vmd system for achieving the stable evaporation process with a fixed temperature after the sulfuric acid solution entered the vmd module it was obvious that a certain energy loss arose inevitably through a series of mass and heat transfer processes because of overcoming certain thermal resistance the thermal resistances of entransy dissipation for the heat transfer across the membrane pore and for the heat conduction across the membrane wall were obtained as 0 0019 and 0 003 k w 1 and the total thermal resistance of entransy dissipation in the vmd module was determined as 0 00012 k w 1 furthermore the entransy dissipation rates across the membrane pore and membrane wall were 91 53 and 57 95 kw k and the corresponding transferred heat across the membrane pore and membrane wall were 6 94 and 4 39 kw besides the heat loss to the environment was calculated to be 0 67 kw as a result a thermal efficiency of 57 8 was gained in the vmd process of the sulfuric acid solution which meant that the current vmd system exhibited a lower energy efficiency due to a larger entransy dissipation loss it is general that the energy efficiency is inversely proportional to entransy dissipation resistance in the heat and mass transfer process of the vmd system a higher entransy dissipation resistance corresponds to a lower energy efficiency obviously it is of great significance to investigate the influencing factors and control methods of entransy dissipation resistance to enhance the energy efficiency of the vmd system 4 2 simulation research here the influence mechanism of critical operation parameters on the entransy dissipation resistance were required to studied which was helpful to weaken the entransy dissipation resistance optimize the heat and mass transfer process and enhance water production performance of the vmd system in this section the heat dissipation in the flow direction and to the environment were not considered and the numerical simulation was performed by solving the balance equations iteratively based on the matlab software platform and the solving flow and relevant parameters are shown in fig 6 and table 8 the existing vmd systems generally have the disadvantages of high energy loss and low permeate flux entransy theory is mainly employed to analyze the irreversibility of the heat transfer process so as to optimize the heat transfer of the vmd system the vmd system involves a mass and heat transfer process of liquid gas phase transformation that the water molecule evaporates at the membrane surface if the mass and heat transfer process in the vmd module is strengthened the loss of heat transfer capability for the vmd module will be decreased and the transferred heat will be increased the corresponding entransy dissipation resistance will be decreased 4 2 1 influence laws of critical operation parameters on entransy dissipation resistance fig 7 shows the influences of x 1 on entransy dissipation resistance entransy dissipation rate and transferred heat of the vmd module at the t 1 of 353 0 k v 1 of 1 0 m s 1and p 3 of 35 kpa it is inferred that increasing the x 1 from 5 to 35 increases the feed solution viscosity and boundary layer thickness at the membrane hot side of the vmd module therefore the entransy dissipation resistance is increased while both of the entransy dissipation rate and transferred heat are decreased and the mass and heat transfer process in the vmd module is then weakened and the corresponding membrane flux across the membrane is also reduced obviously the increase of x 1 will increase the entransy dissipation resistance and decrease the entransy dissipation rate and transferred heat resulting in the drop of heat transfer capability for the vmd system fig 8 shows the influences of t 1 on entransy dissipation resistance entransy dissipation rate and transferred heat of the vmd module under different values of x 1 at the v 1 of 1 0 m s 1and p 3 of 35 kpa it is observed that with an increase in t 1 from 353 0 k to 360 5 k the activity of water molecule at the membrane hot side of the vmd module increases significantly consequently the entransy dissipation resistance is decreased and both of the entransy dissipation rate and transferred heat are increased which leads to the enhancement of the mass and heat transfer process and membrane flux across the membrane for the entire vmd system fig 9 shows the influences of v 1 on entransy dissipation resistance entransy dissipation rate and transferred heat of the vmd module under different values of x 1 at the t 1 of 353 0 k and p 3 of 35 kpa a crucial parameter in the vmd system is the selection of the v 1 for the vmd module increasing v 1 from 1 0 m s 1 to 1 6 m s 1 means the larger reynolds number and stronger turbulence of the solution at the hot side of the vmd module which results in the reduction of boundary layer thickness thus the entransy dissipation resistance in the vmd module decreases while both of the entransy dissipation rate and transferred heat in the vmd module increase and the entire mass and heat transfer process is observed to be strengthened for the vmd system fig 10 shows the influences of p 3 on entransy dissipation resistance entransy dissipation rate and transferred heat of the vmd module under different values of x 1 at the t 1 of 353 0 k and v 1 of 1 0 m s 1 although the vacuum side pressure has little influence on the flow state of the solution in the vmd module it can directly change the vapor pressure difference on both sides of membrane thus affecting the entire process performance the increase of p 3 from 27 5 kpa to 35 kpa leads to the reduction of driving pressure difference resulting in weakening the heat and mass transfer process across the membrane as a result it is observed that the entransy dissipation resistance increase while the entransy dissipation rate and transferred heat decrease for the vmd module 4 2 2 prediction model of entransy dissipation resistance obviously the entransy dissipation can reflect the irreversibility of heat and mass transfer process of phase change occurred in the vmd system and critical operation parameters including feed concentration feed temperature feed velocity and vacuum side pressure are the main factors affecting the entransy dissipation resistance in the vmd process a multiple linear regression method is employed to analyze the relationship between entransy dissipation resistance and various operation parameters which can be expressed as follows 36 y β 0 β 1 x 1 β 2 x 2 β i x i where y is the dependent variable x i is the independent variable β 0 and β i are the intercept and partial regression coefficient respectively taking the entransy dissipation resistance and critical operation parameters as the dependent and independent variables the analysis of multiple linear regression is performed and the relevant results is shown in table 9 and the prediction model of entransy dissipation resistance is finally established by fitting as follows 37 r v m d 3 01594 10 3 5 3 10 6 x 1 2 91 10 6 p 3 8 08 10 6 t 1 1 46 10 6 v 1 it was found that the value of f is 194 87 indicating that a linear model can be used to describe the correlation between independent and dependent variables the value of r 2 correlation coefficient of model fitting is found to be 0 8614 indicating the model has high reliability it can be seen from the fitting formula 37 that the entransy dissipation resistance is positively correlated with the feed concentration and vacuum side pressure and negatively correlated with the feed temperature and feed velocity furthermore a single factor analysis is used to study the influence degree of each operation parameter on the entransy dissipation resistance based on the established prediction model the single factor influence values of all elements including feed concentration feed temperature feed velocity and vacuum side pressure on the relative change of entransy dissipation resistance are gained by the formula 24 33 and the influence degree distribution of each parameter on entransy dissipation resistance is presented in fig 11 at the x 1 of 5 p 3 of 35 kpa t 1 of 353 0 k and v 1 of 1 0 m s 1 under different change ranges each influencing factor has the same influence law on the total change the influence values of the feed temperature is found to be the largest change values of 95 64 followed by vacuum side pressure feed concentration and feed velocity with 3 42 0 89 and 0 05 respectively thus it can be concluded that the influence degrees of critical operation parameters on entransy dissipation resistance rank as follows feed temperature vacuum side pressure feed concentration feed velocity according to the obtained calculation formula the entransy dissipation resistances in the vmd process under multiple working conditions can be predicted which is helpful to select and match critical operation parameters reasonably for reducing the entransy dissipation resistance and strengthening the mass and heat transfer of the sulfuric acid solution in the vmd process based on the aforementioned results the influence mechanism of critical parameters on the entransy dissipation performance is revealed through numerical simulation the process optimization of the vmd system will be performed based on the entransy dissipation theory in the next work 5 conclusions in the present paper a vmd system was suggested to evaporate the sulfuric acid solution and the relevant mathematical models and experimental device were built successively the separation performance and entransy dissipation performance were analyzed based on the obtained experimental data furthermore the influence mechanism from critical operation parameters on entransy dissipation performance were considered and discussed based on the numerical simulation the major conclusions were made as follows 1 through the experiment with the decrease of x 1 and p 3 or increase of t 1 and v 1 the increase of membrane flux was observed moreover the conductivity of produced condensate water was kept within 20 μs cm 1 much lower than that of tap water of 120 200 μs cm 1 which indicated that utilizing the current vmd module to treat sulfuric acid solution could achieve the high separation efficiency and obtain extremely pure fresh water 2 through the experiment x 1 t 1 v 1 and p 3 were fixed at 10 353 k 1 0 m s 1 and 24 kpa respectively the entransy dissipation resistances across the membrane pore and membrane wall were 0 0019 k w 1 and 0 003 k w 1 and the total thermal resistance was obtained as 0 00012 k w 1 the transferred heat across the membrane pore and membrane wall and loss to the environment were 6 94 4 39 and 0 67 kw which led to a lower thermal efficiency of 57 8 owing to a larger entransy dissipation loss 3 through the simulation it was concluded that decreasing x 1 and p 3 or increasing t 1 and v 1 could decrease entransy dissipation resistance and increase the transferred heat which contributed to the enhancement of heat transfer capability within the vmd system more importantly the prediction model of entransy dissipation resistance was established the influence degrees of operation parameters on entransy dissipation resistance rank as feed temperature vacuum side pressure feed concentration feed velocity which was helpful to select and match critical parameters reasonably for reducing the entransy dissipation resistance and strengthening the mass and heat transfer of the vmd system it can be concluded that the analyze model based on the energy and entransy concepts developed in the current study simplifies the approach for analyzing the heat and mass transfer processes within the vmd system after obtaining a large number of accurate values for the membrane flux and entransy dissipation resistance under different working conditions the future work focuses on the multi objective optimization using the feed temperature feed concentration feed velocity and vacuum side pressure as the optimization variable and the linear weighted composite function of membrane flux entransy dissipation resistance and so on as the optimization objective with the aid of genetic algorithm to achieve the maximize energy efficiency

always an indispensable resource for preserving the humanity s survival and development the demand for fresh water is growing exponentially with the continuous increase in global population industrialization and modernization accordingly fresh water production methods and the corresponding devices have attracted widespread attentions all over the world recently recovery and utilization of industrial wastewater in particular the sulfuric acid wastewater has been identified as one of the sustainable solutions to obtain fresh water 1 3 membrane distillation md is an emerging and promising separation technology that has been studied in several application fields including wastewater treatment desalination medicine concentration and food processing 4 in an md process a microporous hydrophobic membrane is selected as a barrier to allow only the vapors to reach the permeate side across the membrane pores which achieves the solution s concentration and purification considering the condensation form of vapor in the vacuum side various md configurations have been developed over the past decades 5 8 1 direct contact membrane distillation in which both sides of the hydrophobic membrane are in direct contact with the liquid phase 2 air gap membrane distillation in which a certain amount of air gap exists between the hydrophobic membrane surface and condensation surface 3 sweeping gas membrane distillation in which the inert gas is employed to sweep away the vapor 4 vacuum membrane distillation vmd in which the vapor is extracted directly using a vacuum system thereinto the vmd has the largest permeate flux among these configurations due to the larger driving pressure difference on two sides of membrane caused by the applied negative environment in the vacuum side wastewater treatment for the production of fresh water has been considered as a typical application considered in vmd research many studies and attempts on the use of vmd technology in wastewater treatment fields have been performed nie 9 focused on the application of vmd for the treatment of low level radioactive wastewater containing uranium the research results indicated that a permeate flux of 11 3 l m 2 h 1 and a separation efficiency of 99 99 were obtained when using the simulated wastewater as feed li 10 introduced a novel multi effect vmd system to treat hypersaline water and revealed the mass and heat transfer mechanism of condensation convection distillation within the entire process more importantly such hybrid system required less energy compared to a conventional single effect system zhang 11 developed a vmd experimental device in which the membrane material was selected as polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe with strong corrosion to evaporate the sulfuric acid solution as the main result a separation efficiency of 100 was achieved in the evaporation process obviously vmd technology has shown an excellent separation effect regardless of whether a salt solution or sulfuric acid solution is used however due to the polarization phenomenon membrane fouling membrane wetting the lack of appropriate membrane materials the lack of heat recovery devices and other factors the existing vmd devices have the poor operation stability lower thermal efficiency and permeate flux which have seriously hindered the further industrial application of the vmd technology therefore a large number of scholars have established heat and mass transfer models according to the structural type of vmd module and extensive investigations to enhance the performance of the vmd system have been done via both numerical simulation and experiments firstly the influence mechanism of membrane characteristic parameters such as membrane thickness membrane pore tortuosity factor porosity as well as membrane length on the vmd process has been deeply investigated to find ways to improve its performance mendez 12 studied the effects of membrane

flux suga 13 experimentally investigated the effects of membrane characteristic parameters on the long term operation stability of the vmd process in addition the influence of operation parameters on the vmd process should also be considered helen 14 investigated the impacts from key factors on the mass transfer and membrane fouling in the vmd process for inland brine water treatment experimental

vacuum side pressure feed concentration and feed temperature included on membrane fouling in the vmd process which was helpful to find the optimum operating conditions yielding the maximum permeate flux the modification of vmd module structure is also an effective method to enhance the vmd process performance and the alternative ways mainly include the following 16 19 1 developing new and efficient membrane materials 2 changing the arrangement of the membrane tube 3 coating nanostructured materials on the membrane surface 4 changing the morphology of membrane tube moreover special attention has been paid to the operation process improvement all over the world min 20 found that membrane fouling was inhibited to a certain extent by adding a cleaning agent and a scale inhibitor to the md module so as to improve the permeate flux li 21 used bubbling to produce a two phase flow in the vmd process which increased the turbulence degree of the solution and decreased the boundary layer resistance on the hot side resulting in water production improvement and membrane fouling control a huge amount of energy is necessary to achieve the evaporation and concentration of the feed liquid in the vmd process in order to satisfy the energy requirements the relevant methods of energy efficiency improvement have been proposed and developed in recent decades boutikos 22 developed a multi effect vmd system in view of the latent heat recovery principle of multi effect evaporation process and the specific energy consumption was gained as 250 kwh t 1 when the feed temperature was set to 353 15 k however due to the complex process and low vapor temperature the improvement of recovery efficiency of latent heat is limited kim 23 studied a hybrid system of solar and vmd by combining experiment and simulation the minimum specific energy consumption was found to be 220 kwh t 1 sarbatly 24 tried to introduce the geothermal energy into the vmd process and the highest flux

suggested a vmd system with a heat pump cycle coupled aiming to provide heating source for the vmd process by using heat pump energy saving technology experimental results showed that the system consumed 0 3 t of fresh vapor for each 1 t of water evaporated si 26 introduced a mechanical vapor recompression mvr technology into the vmd process in view of the self heat recuperation theory with the objective of recovering and reusing the vapor s latent heat it was verified that the energy efficiency of vmd was significantly improved and the specific energy consumption was shown to be 81 95 kwh t 1 as we all know a vmd system involves a heat transfer process which mainly includes convective heat transfer across the boundary layer evaporation of liquid water at the membrane surface heat conduction across the membrane and vapor condensation by cooling water the irreversibility of the whole heat transfer process will inevitably lead to a large amount of heat dissipation entransy theory 27 is a novel concept that properly describes the heat transfer ability of objects and such ability in the transfer process may be reduced therefore it can reflect the irreversibility of heat transfer process and can be introduced to analyze and optimize the thermodynamic system similar to the transfer of an electric current in a conductor and fluid flow in a pipe heat transfer in the medium is an irreversible process generally speaking the current passing through a conductor needs to consume electrical energy to overcome resistance while a fluid in a pipe needs to consume mechanical energy to overcome fluid resistance accordingly the heat flow in the medium will inevitably consume thermal potential energy to overcome thermal resistance so as to achieve the heat transfer process thus the loss of thermal potential energy caused by overcoming thermal resistance is defined as entransy dissipation chen 28 tried to combine the entropy theory and entransy theory to design and optimize the convective heat transfer process li et al 29 applied the entransy theory to optimize the serrated fin in the plate fin heat exchanger in their work the impacts from the geometrical parameters of heat exchanger on entransy dissipation thermal resistance that resulted from heat transfer and fluid friction were revealed by using numerical simulation and experiment moreover optimal results based on the multi objective function considering the entransy dissipation thermal resistance were also obtained from the above literature survey it can be generalized that despite a large number of extensive and in depth researches focusing on various aspects such as feasibility water production as well as energy consumption of the vmd system the research gap of the current vmd system is obvious the mechanism model of heat and mass transfer is not perfect and the energy efficiency still remains at a lower level owing to the larger irreversibility resulted from the heat and mass transfer resistance the entransy theory which properly describes the irreversibility and heat transfer capability and is more universal and accordant with the requirements of optimizing vmd system however the entransy dissipation concept has not been considered to explore the potential improvements of the vmd system in the present paper the mathematical models were firstly built in the light of the mass and heat conservation as well as entransy theory then the separation performance and entransy dissipation performance were investigated based on the obtained experimental data from a vmd experimental setup finally the influence mechanism of critical operation parameters including feed concentration feed temperature feed velocity as well as vacuum side pressure on entransy dissipation performance

introduction section entransy theory can be used to analyze the irreversibility of heat transfer process so as to optimize heat transfer process and reduce heat loss in the vmd system therefore the entransy balance equation is established through the entransy analysis of the heat transfer process within the vmd system the vmd process involves a lot of heat and mass transport including the transport process from the bulk solution to the membrane surface through the thermal boundary layer and the transport process of phase change across the membrane thereinto the transport from the bulk solution to the membrane surface is a convective heat transfer process and there is a certain entransy dissipation the relevant entransy balance equation is described as follows 17 ϕ b q b t f t f m q 2 b 2 ρc p v where v is volume flow rate of fluid the phase change process on the membrane surface is the most important part of the whole heat and mass transfer and the vapor generated by the phase change is the membrane flux through the membrane pores the heat transfer process of which includes two parts the heat across the membrane pore in the form of vaporization heat and the heat across the membrane wall in the form of heat conduction since the phase change occurs at the hot side membrane surface the entransy flow caused by the phase change is considered as the input entransy flow on the hot side of membrane as a result the entransy dissipation rate of the vapor carrying latent heat across the membrane pore is shown as 40 18 ϕ v nγ v a m t f m t p the entransy dissipation rate for the

2 e x n e y m i 1 i 1 n a mi x 1 x i a m 1 x 1 y m e x 1 i 1 i n n a mi x n x i a mn x n y m e x n obviously the relative changes of all the elements in set a is closely related to the relative changes of each element in set b accordingly the single factor analysis method is introduced to investigate the influence of the relative changes of all elements in set a on the relative changes of elements in set b and the above formula can be changed into 29 e y 1 e y 2 e y m b 11 b 12 b 1 n b 21 b 22 b 2 n b m 1 b m 2 b mn e x 1 e x 2 e x n where b mn is expressed as follows 30 b 11 i 1 i 1 n

the relative change of element y i 3 experiment to verify the established mathematical models a set of experiments were conducted using a vmd experimental device as shown in fig 4 an electric heater was used to meet the heat requirement of the system the vmd module was composed of several hollow fibers manufactured from polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe material the condenser was utilized to condense the vapor the vacuum pump was employed to create a negative pressure environment for the system the vmd system is a closed cycle system composed of many components which are interdependent and mutually affected due to the characteristics of multi equipment multi process multi state and multi working conditions the operation process is relatively complicated the experiment must be carried out strictly in accordance with the operating flow the detailed operation steps are as follows a ensure that there is enough feed solution in the feed tank open the electrical heater within the feed tank to preheat the feed solution to the set temperature start the feed pump and adjust the control valve to make the feed solution enter the vmd module at a certain flow rate b open the control valve of cooling circulating water and start the vacuum pump to vacuumize c as the experimental conditions are stable observe and record the display number of each instrument regularly to ensure that the liquid level of the feed tank gradually decreases and the liquid level of the distilling tank gradually increases d change the feed concentration feed temperature feed flow rate vacuum side pressure repeat the experiment under various working conditions throughout the experiments all the operation parameters were monitored using a measurement system including thermometer pressure gauge and flow meter which were coated with a high corrosion resistance material the properties of the key components were depicted in table 1 the flow meter with a range of 160 1600 l h 1 and a precision of 2 5 was utilized to test the flow rate of feed solution the pt 100 temperature sensor with a range of 273 373 k and a precision of 1 was utilized to obtain the temperatures of each test point and the probe of which was coated with corrosion resistant tetrafluoron material the pressure sensor with a range of 0 1 0 mpa and a precision of 1 0 was employed to measure the pressures of each test point a conductivity meter with a precision of 2 was employed to measure the liquid conductivity each experiment was required to be repeated at least 3 times aiming to ensure the reproducibility and reliability of the results in addition the system performance parameters such as membrane flux and thermal efficiency can be calculated indirectly with the directly measured physical parameters and the measured data inevitably has errors assuming that the performance parameter y is a function of physical parameters x 1 x 2 x n that can be directly measured the relationship between the standard error of the performance parameter y and each directly measured physical parameter is expressed as follows 35 σy i 1 n y xi 2 4 results and discussion 4 1 experiment research 4 1 1 mathematical models validation here a vmd platform was constructed to obtain the reliable experimental results and validate the mathematical models based on the errors of directly measured physical parameters described in the above section the relative error of the performance parameters for the experimental system can be calculated to be 3 5 which ensured the accuracy of the measurement sensors fig 5 showed the relevant validation results of mathematical models in the following conditions feed concentration x 1 of 2 feed temperature t 1 of 348 0 k and feed velocity v 1 of 1 0 m s 1 it could be seen that the experimental results corresponded very well to the simulated results estimated using the established mathematical models obviously the error bars of each measuring point reported in fig 5 were all below 15 which supported the repeatability of the experiment results the relative error values between the simulated and experimental membrane flux were 5 21 15 07 12 34 14 36 12 14 11 27 and 15 94 when varying the vacuum side pressure p 3 from 8 kpa to 32 kpa in addition table 2 showed the comparison of experimental and simulated membrane fluxes under multiple working conditions the relative errors values between the simulated and experimental values were all within 15 the above relative errors were all within 20 which demonstrated the accuracy of the current built mathematical models 4 1 2 analysis of separation performance for the vmd system table 3 presented the experimental values of each point parameter versus p 3 at the x 1 of 2 t 1 of 348 0 k and v 1 of 1 0 m s 1 the value of p 3 played an important role in the vmd process it was observed that under the effect of p 3 varying from 8 kpa to 32 kpa the membrane flux was obtained with an amplitude drop of 90 5 from 4 0 kg m 2 h 1 to 0 38 kg m 2 h 1 and the temperatures of vapor and concentrated solution increased accordingly the produced vapor was then condensed to normal temperature state in the condenser resulting in the elevation of cooling water temperature less condensate corresponded to the lower cooling water temperature at the heat exchanger outlet similar to the influence from the p 3 the relevant variation laws of water production versus v 1 were also presented in table 4 when x 1 t 1 and p 3 were fixed at 2 353 0 k and 24 kpa respectively in case the v 1 is raised from 0 4 m s 1 to 1 0 m s 1 the membrane flux would be increased due to a better heat and mass transfer in the vmd module a lower concentrated solution temperature and higher vapor temperature would be attained as a result the cooling water temperature at the condenser outlet increased at the fixed mass flow rate at the fixed x 1 of 2 v 1 of 1 0 m s 1 and p 3 of 24 kpa the membrane flux was obviously increased from 0 4 kg m 2 h 1 to 1 98 kg m 2 h 1 with the elevation of t 1 from 338 0 k to 353 0 k and the temperatures of concentrated solution vapor and cooling water were found to be increased accordingly as shown in the table 5 thus it could be inferred that the vmd performance for sulfuric acid solution was very sensitive to the t 1 after verifying the impacts of the values of t 1 v 1 and p 3 on the vmd performance of sulfuric acid solution the value of x 1 is also very critical to investigate such influence accordingly the change of x 1 is selected to focus on the caused variation laws of water production in the vmd process presented in table 6 at the fixed t 1 of 353 0 k v 1 of 1 0 m s 1 and p 3 of 24 kpa it was observed that after the elevation of x 1 from 2 to 14 which indicated the mass and heat transfer process in the vmd module was weakened the membrane flux was reduced from 1 98 kg m 2 h 1 to 1 7 kg m 2 h 1 with a magnitude of 14 14 while the corresponding concentrated solution temperature moved toward the higher direction but the vapor and cooling water temperatures moved toward the lower direction additionally the conductivity of the obtained condensate water was kept within 20 μs cm 1 which was much lower than that of tap water 120 200 μs cm 1 thus utilizing the current vmd module to treat sulfuric acid solution could achieve the high separation efficiency and obtain extremely pure fresh water 4 1 3 analysis of entransy dissipation performance for the vmd system compared with other separation processes the water production performance of the existing vmd system is still not as expected due to the low system energy efficiency thus it is necessary to analyze the energy efficiency of the vmd system the entransy analyze model established in the above section was employed to describe the coupled heat and mass transfer process with the objective of enhancing energy efficiency and reducing energy consumption of the vmd system in the practical vmd system there was always a certain entransy dissipation which could reflect the irreversibility of transport process during the transport process of heat and mass in the vmd system resistance was considered as the cause that turned reversibility into irreversibility therefore thermal resistance based on the entransy dissipation would be employed to analyze the transport mechanism of the vmd system the vmd experiments were carried out under controlled conditions using a built vmd experimental setup and the actual operation data was chosen for the entransy analyses of the vmd process in this analyses x 1 t 1 v 1 and p 3 were fixed at 10 353 0 k 1 0 m s 1 and 24 kpa respectively overall entransy analyze results of the vmd system was presented in table 7 during the experiment an electric heater with a power of 12 kw was used to provide heat to the vmd system for achieving the stable evaporation process with a fixed temperature after the sulfuric acid solution entered the vmd module it was obvious that a certain energy loss arose inevitably through a series of mass and heat transfer processes because of overcoming certain thermal resistance the thermal resistances of entransy dissipation for the heat transfer across the membrane pore and for the heat conduction across the membrane wall were obtained as 0 0019 and 0 003 k w 1 and the total thermal resistance of entransy dissipation in the vmd module was determined as 0 00012 k w 1 furthermore the entransy dissipation rates across the membrane pore and membrane wall were 91 53 and 57 95 kw k and the corresponding transferred heat across the membrane pore and membrane wall were 6 94 and 4 39 kw besides the heat loss to the environment was calculated to be 0 67 kw as a result a thermal efficiency of 57 8 was gained in the vmd process of the sulfuric acid solution which meant that the current vmd system exhibited a lower energy efficiency due to a larger entransy dissipation loss it is general that the energy efficiency is inversely proportional to entransy dissipation resistance in the heat and mass transfer process of the vmd system a higher entransy dissipation resistance corresponds to a lower energy efficiency obviously it is of great significance to investigate the influencing factors and control methods of entransy dissipation resistance to enhance the energy efficiency of the vmd system 4 2 simulation research here the influence mechanism of critical operation parameters on the entransy dissipation resistance were required to studied which was helpful to weaken the entransy dissipation resistance optimize the heat and mass transfer process and enhance water production performance of the vmd system in this section the heat dissipation in the flow direction and to the environment were not considered and the numerical simulation was performed by solving the balance equations iteratively based on the matlab software platform and the solving flow and relevant parameters are shown in fig 6 and table 8 the existing vmd systems generally have the disadvantages of high energy loss and low permeate flux entransy theory is mainly employed to analyze the irreversibility of the heat transfer process so as to optimize the heat transfer of the vmd system the vmd system involves a mass and heat transfer process of liquid gas phase transformation that the water molecule evaporates at the membrane surface if the mass and heat transfer process in the vmd module is strengthened the loss of heat transfer capability for the vmd module will be decreased and the transferred heat will be increased the corresponding entransy dissipation resistance will be decreased 4 2 1 influence laws of critical operation parameters on entransy dissipation resistance fig 7 shows the influences of x 1 on entransy dissipation resistance entransy dissipation rate and transferred heat of the vmd module at the t 1 of 353 0 k v 1 of 1 0 m s 1and p 3 of 35 kpa it is inferred that increasing the x 1 from 5 to 35 increases the feed solution viscosity and boundary layer thickness at the membrane hot side of the vmd module therefore the entransy dissipation resistance is increased while both of the entransy dissipation rate and transferred heat are decreased and the mass and heat transfer process in the vmd module is then weakened and the corresponding membrane flux across the membrane is also reduced obviously the increase of x 1 will increase the entransy dissipation resistance and decrease the entransy dissipation rate and transferred heat resulting in the drop of heat transfer capability for the vmd system fig 8 shows the influences of t 1 on entransy dissipation resistance entransy dissipation rate and transferred heat of the vmd module under different values of x 1 at the v 1 of 1 0 m s 1and p 3 of 35 kpa it is observed that with an increase in t 1 from 353 0 k to 360 5 k the activity of water molecule at the membrane hot side of the vmd module increases significantly consequently the entransy dissipation resistance is decreased and both of the entransy dissipation rate and transferred heat are increased which leads to the enhancement of the mass and heat transfer process and membrane flux across the membrane for the entire vmd system fig 9 shows the influences of v 1 on entransy dissipation resistance entransy dissipation rate and transferred heat of the vmd module under different values of x 1 at the t 1 of 353 0 k and p 3 of 35 kpa a crucial parameter in the vmd system is the selection of the v 1 for the vmd module increasing v 1 from 1 0 m s 1 to 1 6 m s 1 means the larger reynolds number and stronger turbulence of the solution at the hot side of the vmd module which results in the reduction of boundary layer thickness thus the entransy dissipation resistance in the vmd module decreases while both of the entransy dissipation rate and transferred heat in the vmd module increase and the entire mass and heat transfer process is observed to be strengthened for the vmd system fig 10 shows the influences of p 3 on entransy dissipation resistance entransy dissipation rate and transferred heat of the vmd module under different values of x 1 at the t 1 of 353 0 k and v 1 of 1 0 m s 1 although the vacuum side pressure has little influence on the flow state of the solution in the vmd module it can directly change the vapor pressure difference on both sides of membrane thus affecting the entire process performance the increase of p 3 from 27 5 kpa to 35 kpa leads to the reduction of driving pressure difference resulting in weakening the heat and mass transfer process across the membrane as a result it is observed that the entransy dissipation resistance increase while the entransy dissipation rate and transferred heat decrease for the vmd module 4 2 2 prediction model of entransy dissipation resistance obviously the entransy dissipation can reflect the irreversibility of heat and mass transfer process of phase change occurred in the vmd system and critical operation parameters including feed concentration feed temperature feed velocity and vacuum side pressure are the main factors affecting the entransy dissipation resistance in the vmd process a multiple linear regression method is employed to analyze the relationship between entransy dissipation resistance and various operation parameters which can be expressed as follows 36 y β 0 β 1 x 1 β 2 x 2 β i x i where y is the dependent variable x i is the independent variable β 0 and β i are the intercept and partial regression coefficient respectively taking the entransy dissipation resistance and critical operation parameters as the dependent and independent variables the analysis of multiple linear regression is performed and the relevant results is shown in table 9 and the prediction model of entransy dissipation resistance is finally established by fitting as follows 37 r v m d 3 01594 10 3 5 3 10 6 x 1 2 91 10 6 p 3 8 08 10 6 t 1 1 46 10 6 v 1 it was found that the value of f is 194 87 indicating that a linear model can be used to describe the correlation between independent and dependent variables the value of r 2 correlation coefficient of model fitting is found to be 0 8614 indicating the model has high reliability it can be seen from the fitting formula 37 that the entransy dissipation resistance is positively correlated with the feed concentration and vacuum side pressure and negatively correlated with the feed temperature and feed velocity furthermore a single factor analysis is used to study the influence degree of each operation parameter on the entransy dissipation resistance based on the established prediction model the single factor influence values of all elements including feed concentration feed temperature feed velocity and vacuum side pressure on the relative change of entransy dissipation resistance are gained by the formula 24 33 and the influence degree distribution of each parameter on entransy dissipation resistance is presented in fig 11 at the x 1 of 5 p 3 of 35 kpa t 1 of 353 0 k and v 1 of 1 0 m s 1 under different change ranges each influencing factor has the same influence law on the total change the influence values of the feed temperature is found to be the largest change values of 95 64 followed by vacuum side pressure feed concentration and feed velocity with 3 42 0 89 and 0 05 respectively thus it can be concluded that the influence degrees of critical operation parameters on entransy dissipation resistance rank as follows feed temperature vacuum side pressure feed concentration feed velocity according to the obtained calculation formula the entransy dissipation resistances in the vmd process under multiple working conditions can be predicted which is helpful to select and match critical operation parameters reasonably for reducing the entransy dissipation resistance and strengthening the mass and heat transfer of the sulfuric acid solution in the vmd process based on the aforementioned results the influence mechanism of critical parameters on the entransy dissipation performance is revealed through numerical simulation the process optimization of the vmd system will be performed based on the entransy dissipation theory in the next work 5 conclusions in the present paper a vmd system was suggested to evaporate the sulfuric acid solution and the relevant mathematical models and experimental device were built successively the separation performance and entransy dissipation performance were analyzed based on the obtained experimental data furthermore the influence mechanism from critical operation parameters on entransy dissipation performance were considered and discussed based on the numerical simulation the major conclusions were made as follows 1 through the experiment with the decrease of x 1 and p 3 or increase of t 1 and v 1 the increase of membrane flux was observed moreover the conductivity of produced condensate water was kept within 20 μs cm 1 much lower than that of tap water of 120 200 μs cm 1 which indicated that utilizing the current vmd module to treat sulfuric acid solution could achieve the high separation efficiency and obtain extremely pure fresh water 2 through the experiment x 1 t 1 v 1 and p 3 were fixed at 10 353 k 1 0 m s 1 and 24 kpa respectively the entransy dissipation resistances across the membrane pore and membrane wall were 0 0019 k w 1 and 0 003 k w 1 and the total thermal resistance was obtained as 0 00012 k w 1 the transferred heat across the membrane pore and membrane wall and loss to the environment were 6 94 4 39 and 0 67 kw which led to a lower thermal efficiency of 57 8 owing to a larger entransy dissipation loss 3 through the simulation it was concluded that decreasing x 1 and p 3 or increasing t 1 and v 1 could decrease entransy dissipation resistance and increase the transferred heat which contributed to the enhancement of heat transfer capability within the vmd system more importantly the prediction model of entransy dissipation resistance was established the influence degrees of operation parameters on entransy dissipation resistance rank as feed temperature vacuum side pressure feed concentration feed velocity which was helpful to select and match critical parameters reasonably for reducing the entransy dissipation resistance and strengthening the mass and heat transfer of the vmd system it can be concluded that the analyze model based on the energy and entransy concepts developed in the current study simplifies the approach for analyzing the heat and mass transfer processes within the vmd system after obtaining a large number of accurate values for the membrane flux and entransy dissipation resistance under different working conditions the future work focuses on the multi objective optimization using the feed temperature feed concentration feed velocity and vacuum side pressure as the optimization variable and the linear weighted composite function of membrane flux entransy dissipation resistance and so on as the optimization objective with the aid of genetic algorithm to achieve the maximize energy efficiency

12779,this study aimed to develop a collectable adsorbent for cs using clay mineral and alginate gel the adsorption capacity of vermiculite verm for cs increased from 97 1 mg g to 119 mg g after sodium citric treatment the verm used in this study has a partial chlorite structure and the existence of interlayer material was considered the adsorption sites of verm for cs increased because the interlayer material in the partly chlorite structure was removed via sodium citric treatment the langmuir adsorption isotherm described this adsorption phenomenon well indicating that the adsorption of cs by verm after sodium citric treatment verm cit is monolayer adsorption since a typical phenomenon was also observed in which the basal spacing became approximately 1 0 nm when cs was adsorbed by the interlayer of vermiculite the interlayer of verm cit functioned as an adsorption site verm cit was encapsulated in alginate gel beads ag verm cit for accessible collection after adsorption although the equilibrium adsorption time of ag verm cit was extended from 10 min without encapsulation verm cit to over 360 min an adsorption capacity of 60 5 mg g was obtained even after 30 min the developed adsorbent requires time to reach equilibrium however the adsorption capacity was similar to or higher than reported in previous studies even with a relatively shorter contact time additionally the weight and volume of the adsorbent encapsulated in alginate gel beads can be decreased by air drying without heat these properties can contribute to removing cs from the aquatic environment and to the stable management of adsorbents with radionuclides graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords adsorbent vermiculite sodium citrate treatment alginate gel bead cesium data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction hazardous substances that significantly impact the ecosystem and human activity must be removed before they diffuse into the environment while many technologies have already been developed adsorption offers the advantage of ease of handling and versatile performance for various coloring substances and many kinds of pollutants it has been applied to multiple fields such as food processing agriculture and fishery 1 3 especially in water treatment many characteristic adsorbents have been developed to remove various heavy metals and dyes 4 7 alkali metal ions such as cs and k have high solubility even in basic conditions to be collected as precipitates of hydroxides therefore separation using some adsorbents is considered effective for alkali metals radioactive species were discharged into the environment during the fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant accident in japan on march 11 2011 in particular 137cs have a long half life of approximately 30 years and continue to impact the environment thus it is necessary to remove 137cs from waste solutions and transform it into a stable and manageable form in addition to waste solutions contaminated soils estimated to total 13 14 million m3 also require treatment 8 chemical treatment methods such as ion exchange 9 thermal treatment 10 and washing with an inorganic 11 or organic acid 12 have been investigated to reduce the volume of contaminated soils after elution of the radionuclides from these soils using wet methods radionuclides have to be removed from the treated water finally some methods have been developed to remove cs from a large amount of wastewater using adsorbents membranes and columns 13 15 for the adsorption of cs many materials such as prussian blue copper hexacyanoferrate pan crown ether functionalized wood cellulosic etc have been investigated 16 19 to enhance the adsorption capacity the treatment of adsorbents with high temperatures acids organic solvents and sometimes complex procedures have been conducted however the energy requirement for heating and the use of considerable amounts of chemicals for the preparation limit their practical application therefore developing adsorbents prepared from ubiquitous materials without additional energy and particular chemicals is desired to treat waste solutions additionally adsorbents should have a significant adsorption capacity good operability low environmental impact and easy management after adsorptive separation the intense interaction between cs and clay minerals has been previously reported cs have been considered to be adsorbed in the interlayer or frayed edge site fes of clay minerals 20 21 in fukushima prefecture japan biotite and vermiculite a weathered product of abukuma granite were distributed in the soil over the whole prefecture to selectively adsorb radioactive cs 22 the cs ions bound with biotite and vermiculite are not easily desorbed because of the formation of an inner sphere complex with the interlayer or fes 23 this irreversible adsorption property of clay minerals for cs is advantageous in the stable management of radionuclides cs can be stored as it is permanently adsorbed in the clay mineral therefore some clay mineral based adsorbents for radioactive cs have been investigated 24 26 alginic acid a natural organic substance in seaweed is commonly used to encapsulate adsorbents in powder form 27 29 for instance montmorillonite encapsulated in an alginate gel bead has been investigated for the removal of cs 30 this adsorbent was modified with lithium to enhance the selectivity for cs however lithium is not a cheap material for such modification procedures we found that the adsorption capacity of the vermiculite distributed over fukushima prefecture to adsorb cs increased after treatment with sodium citric without heating in this paper we aimed to develop a novel collectable composite adsorbent by encapsulating vermiculite in alginate gel beads for cs removal from aquatic environments based on a simple concept not requiring external energy and with a low environmental impact 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials vermiculite verm a 2 1 type phyllosilicate clay mineral from ishikawa gun fukushima prefecture japan geo science materials nichika inc kyoto japan was used in this study sodium

purchased from kanto chemical co inc tokyo japan humic acid sodium salt was purchased from sigma aldrich co mo usa these chemicals were used without any pretreatment 2 2 preparation and characteristics of verm the verm was crushed using an agate mortar to a particle size smaller than 53 μm since vermiculite clay sometimes forms a mixed layer with chlorite we identified the verm in this study following procedure typically given that the basal spacing of vermiculite clay is known to decrease from 1 4 nm to 1 0 nm by the adsorption of k in the interlayer 31 the structural change of verm was observed before and after the adsorption of k namely verm 0 1 g was saturated with 25 ml of 1 0 mol l kcl solution three times the verm sample was filtered 5c 1 μm pore size toyo roshi kaisha ltd tokyo japan and washed with distilled water after filtration the verm on the filter paper was dried at 105 c for 16 h yamato constant temperature oven dk 62 yamato scientific co ltd tokyo japan the prepared verm was characterized using x ray diffraction xrd smartlab rigaku corporation tokyo japan using cu kα radiation λ 0 154 nm at 40 kv and 30 ma with a speed of 1 min and an angular step of 0 01 the chemical composition of verm was measured using an energy dispersive x ray fluorescence spectrometer xrf jsx 3100rii jeol ltd tokyo japan and the carbon content was measured using a chns elemental analyzer vario el cube elementar langenselbold germany the adsorbents were characterized using fourier transform infrared spectra ft ir spectrum 100 perkinelmer usa in atr method the morphology of the adsorbent was examined using a scanning electron microscope jsm 6610la jeol ltd tokyo japan at 20 kv accelerating voltage 2 3 treatment with sodium citrate typically the interlayer material such as the hydroxyl sheet that exists in the interlayer of chlorite can be removed by sodium citrate treatment 32 here this procedure was partially modified to improve the adsorption capacity of the verm briefly verm was dispersed into 0 3 mol l sodium citrate solution ph 8 0 at a 1 200 solid liquid ratio the mixture was shaken at 150 rpm at various temperatures and for different contact times and the verm sample was filtered using filter papers 5c the concentrations of al fe mg and si in the filtrate were measured using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy icp aes icps 8100 shimadzu corporation kyoto japan the sample on the filter paper was dried at 105 c for 16 h and the treated verm verm cit was used to perform the adsorption experiment 2 4 adsorption experiments adsorption experiments were conducted using verm and verm cit the verm or verm cit 0 05 g was added to 25 ml of cs solution and the mixture was shaken at 150 rpm at 25 c br 40lf taitec corporation saitama japan the mixture was filtered using filter paper 5c and cs concentration in the filtrate was measured using a flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas za 3000 hitachi high tech corporation tokyo japan the adsorption capacity q was calculated using eq 1 1 q c 0 c e v w where q is the adsorption capacity mg g c 0 and c e are the initial and equilibrium concentrations of cs mg l v is the volume of solution l and w is the weight of the adsorbent g the effects of sodium citrate treatment temperature and time were evaluated based on the obtained adsorption capacity for cs the xrd of the adsorbent after cs adsorption was measured and assessed for the basal spacing the solution ph was measured using a ph meter d 51 horiba ltd kyoto japan the adsorption experiment was operated under various conditions of cs concentrations ph and contact times the effect of ph was evaluated using a csoh solution prepared at various ph values adjusted with hcl to avoid interfering with na the adsorption kinetics was evaluated using the pseudo first order pseudo second order elovich and intraparticle diffusion ipd kinetics models and the adsorption isotherms were evaluated using the langmuir and freundlich isotherm models the details of the model equations are provided in the supporting information 2 5 ion exchange isotherm the ion exchange isotherm is useful for evaluating the selectivity of the adsorbent 33 35 and was used for the developed adsorbent verm cit sodium prepared using chloride salt was used as the competing ion the prepared solution contained cs and na in various proportions the total normality of cs and na was 5 mmol l the adsorption experiment was carried out using the procedure described in section 2 4 the concentrations of cs and na in the filtrate were measured using aas and were used to calculate the ratio of cs in the solution and soil the vanselow selectivity coefficient k v nacs was calculated using eq 2 35 2 k nacs v csx na nax cs where csx and nax are mole fractions in the exchange phase of clay mineral and na and cs are present activities calculated using visual minteq version 3 1 when there is non preference in the exchange between cations the value of k v nacs is unity 2 6 preparation of ag verm cit beads clay minerals have a large adsorption capacity however as they are powder they are difficult to collect after the adsorption of pollutants therefore we attempted to encapsulate verm and verm cit in alginate gel ag beads the ag verm and ag verm cit were prepared according to the following procedure verm or verm cit was added to distilled water and powdered sodium alginate 1 wt while stirring with a magnetic stirrer if distilled water is added to the sodium alginate powder first or clay minerals are added to the prepared sodium alginate solution it does not disperse well the prepared ag verm or ag verm cit solution was dripped into 0 1 mol l cacl2 solutions using a peristaltic pump mp 1000 tokyo rikakikai co ltd tokyo japan through a silicon tube id 3 mm with a luer fitting vrm306 nordson medical corporation westlake oh usa at the tip the dripping speed was approximately 2 ml min almost 30 drops min a cacl2 solution containing ag beads was continuously stirred with a magnetic stirrer for 3 h for the bead maturation 36 fig 1 then the prepared ag verm and ag verm cit beads were used for adsorption experiments the procedure is the same as in section 2 4 and twenty five beads were added to 25 ml of 500 mg cs l solution ph 6 0 as ag beads include water molecules it is difficult to compare the adsorption capacities of ag beads with powder form adsorbents therefore the prepared ag beads were lyophilized to obtain the dry weight fdu 1200 tokyo rikakikai co ltd tokyo japan which was used to calculate the adsorption capacities of ag verm and ag verm cit 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristic of verm the morphology of verm is shown in fig s1 verm has a layered structure like common clay minerals the chemical composition and x ray diffractograms of verm used in this study are shown in table s1 and fig s2 the carbon content of verm was below the quantitative lower limit of the chns elemental analyzer 0 2 the verm used in this study had a 1 4 nm of basal spacing fig s2 a typical property of vermiculite clay although the basal spacing of verm generally becomes 1 0 1 1 nm after k saturation 31 verm was kept at a basal spacing of 1 4 nm fig s3 chlorite also a phyllosilicate clay mineral has a sheet like interlayer material in the interlayer and the basal spacing does not narrow after k saturation because vermiculite clay and chlorite are often produced as mixtures the verm used in this study probably has a partial chlorite structure 3 2 condition of the sodium citrate treatment the conditions for sodium citrate treatment were investigated to improve the adsorption capacity of verm fig 2a shows the adsorption capacity for cs at each treatment temperature and original indicates the adsorption capacity of verm without any treatment in a previous study sodium citrate treatment was conducted at 100 c for 6 h to remove the interlayer material of the chlorite 32 in this study the adsorption capacity of verm was improved even at 25 c for 6 h and this capacity was constant up to 80 c the adsorption capacity did not change at various treatment periods at 25 c fig 2b fig 2c shows the x ray diffractograms of verm original and verm cit which adsorbed cs in each sodium citrate treatment period at 25 c although the basal spacing of verm original became 1 24 nm after cs adsorption the basal spacing of verm cit was 1 15 nm after any treatment time the basal spacing of clay minerals was known to be around 1 0 nm due to cs adsorption 37 these results suggest that more cs can penetrate into the interlayer as the interlayer material of verm was removed by sodium citrate treatment as a result the cs adsorption capacity is improved fig 2d shows the eluted elements from the verm by sodium citrate treatment the most eluted element by sodium citrate treatment was mg almost the same amount of mg was eluted even in the treatment with 0 3 mol l nacl fig 2d this result suggests that the eluted mg is an ion exchangeable form and is not an element that constitutes the interlayer material the next most eluted element was si the amount eluted with nacl treatment was estimated to derive from soluble silicate as an impurity in verm the third most eluted element was al which was not eluted with nacl the interlayer material eluted with sodium citrate could be identified as a 1 1 type clay mineral or 2 1 type clay mineral like structure based on the si al molar ratio in the eluent 38 the si al molar ratio in the eluent was calculated by subtracting the amount of si eluted with nacl fig s4 the si al molar ratio was 1 8 1 9 in this study the interlayer material could be regarded as the 2 1 type clay mineral like structure 38 the obtained conditions for the sodium citrate treatment were 25 c and 2 h of treatment which is enough to enhance the adsorption capacity of verm the interlayer material was removed in a shorter time than in previously reported studies 32 because the verm used in this study was relatively weathered and only had a partial chlorite structure the morphology of verm was unaltered before and after sodium citrate treatment fig s1 and the structure of verm was constant 3 3 effect of the removal of interlayer material on cs adsorption the effects of the removal of the interlayer material on cs adsorption were evaluated the si al molar ratio should be 2 1 in 2 1 type clay mineral without any isomorphous substitution the adsorbed cs has existed in the hollow of six membered rings on a tetrahedral sheet of clay mineral since the si forming the six membered ring is shared with an adjacent six membered ring the ratio of si and cs should be 2 1 in the clay mineral after cs adsorption when cs were fixed in the interlayer of clay minerals cs were held between two tetrahedral sheets and the ratio of si and cs became 4 1 here the eluted interlayer material with sodium citrate treatment was a 2 1 type clay mineral like structure the al and si molar ratio in the eluent should be similar to the ratio in the 2 1 type clay mineral structure since the ratio of si and al of 2 1 type clay mineral is 2 1 the molar ratio of eluted al cs should be 2 1 since the concentration of al was 0 020 mmol g after the 2 h sodium citrate treatment the available adsorption sites for cs were calculated to be 0 010 mmol g due to the removal of the interlayer material directly the increased adsorption capacity for cs of verm due to the 2 h sodium citrate solution treatment was 22 mg g 0 17 mmol g by subtracting the capacity of untreated verm from the capacity of sodium citrate treated verm this calculation indicates that the adsorbed cs were around 17 times higher than the estimated capacity the adsorption for cs on the verm occurred not only where the interlayer material was removed but also on sites that became accessible due to the removal of the interlayer material if the interlayer material is on the edge of the clay mineral and mg ions are located far from the edge the interlayer material interferes with cs adsorption and mg ions cannot be exchanged with cs since most of the al was not eluted by nacl treatment fig 2d nacl did not affect the removal of the interlayer material thus the increase mg concentration observed after nacl treatment was likely due to the elution of exchangeable mg ions from the verm with interlayer material the accessible adsorption site due to the removal of interlayer material with the sodium citrate treatment was estimated by subtracting the amount of mg eluted following nacl treatment from the amount of mg eluted with sodium citrate treatment the eluted amount of mg after the 2 h sodium citrate treatment was 0 51 mmol g and that after nacl treatment was 0 44 mmol g the accessible adsorption site was estimated to be 0 07 mmol g the adsorbed amount of cs increased by 0 17 mmol g due to 2 h sodium citrate treatment since the adsorption capacity of 0 010 mmol g was due to the removal of the interlayer material indicated above the increased adsorption capacity except for the direct effect of removing the interlayer material was calculated to be 0 16 mmol g the ion exchange ratio considering these charges should ideally be 1 2 and an exchange ratio of mg and cs was 1 2 2 in this study mg in the interlayer is exchanged with na derived from sodium citrate treatment and cs is adsorbed in the interlayer by exchanging with na in the interlayer from these calculations it can be concluded that the adsorption sites generated by the sodium citrate treatment include two types the first one is the sites directly occupied by the interlayer material and the second one is sites containing mg ions that were inaccessible due to the presence of the interlayer material fig 3 although the treatment with citric acid reportedly enhances the adsorption capacity of adsorbents made from leaf due to the modification of carboxylic groups 39 the carbon content of verm cit in this study was below the quantitative lower limit 0 2 before and after the sodium citrate treatment moreover the amount of carboxyl group on the verm cit was evaluated by the calcium acetate method 40 and the carboxyl group was not detected on the verm cit the amount of surface acidic functional group was evaluated by the gran plot 41 verm and verm cit was 0 28 and 0 33 mmol g respectively verm cit had a slightly higher value than verm however it was not so high moreover since the ft ir spectra of verm and verm cit was no significant difference fig s5 the special functional groups are not modified on the surface of the verm by sodium citrate treatment these results indicated that the enhancement of the adsorption capacity of verm after sodium citrate treatment was due to the removal of the interlayer material and not to the modification of specific functional group like carboxylic groups by citric acid 3 4 adsorption kinetics of verm and verm cit the adsorption capacities of verm and verm cit at each contact time are shown in fig 4 the elovich model described well the adsorption kinetics of verm and the pseudo second order model described the adsorption kinetics of verm cit table s2 since verm is a natural product and has interlayer materials it fitted the elovich model with a heterogeneous surface the ipd kinetics model indicated the three stage adsorption in verm and verm cit fig s6 the first stage is rapid adsorption due to the interaction between cs and the surface of clay minerals the second stage is slow adsorption due to the penetration and diffusion of cs into the mineral structure similar behavior has been reported in a previous study 25 the third stage is slow distribution and reaching equilibrium the adsorption isotherm was evaluated at a condition of contact time of 24 h fig 5 the langmuir adsorption isotherm well described the cs adsorption in both verm and verm cit table s3 monolayer adsorption was considered the adsorption of cs by clay minerals with a large basal spacing follows the langmuir adsorption isotherm the cs and interlayer sites have strong interactions and the ratio of adsorption in the interlayer was the highest in the total adsorption capacity 42 since an equal amount of na as the adsorbed cs is eluted from verm cit the adsorption of cs is due to ions exchangeable with na fig 6 shows the adsorption capacity under various ph conditions cs speciation was evaluated using visual minteq version 3 1 cs existed as cs between ph 2 12 in this adsorption experiment condition the adsorption capacity of verm was approximately 80 100 mg g under neutral and basic conditions but decreased sharply at ph 2 this tendency was the same for the verm cit clay minerals have both variable and permanent charges the variable charge depends on the ph condition typically its charge becomes negatively strong under basic conditions and h neutralizes it under acidic conditions therefore the variable charge could not contribute to the cs adsorption under low ph conditions and the adsorption capacity decreased at ph 2 the difference between the adsorption capacities at ph 2 and 6 was approximately 40 mg g in both verm and verm cit corresponding to the variable charge amount verm cit had a large adsorption capacity 75 1 mg g even at ph 2 the negative charge generated by removing the interlayer material was immediately neutralized by na derived from sodium citrate since cs were adsorbed by ion exchange with na in the interlayer the adsorption capacity increased by the amount that the interlayer material was removed from the interlayer 3 5 selectivity the ion exchange isotherm of verm cit was used to evaluate selectivity for cs and na if the isotherm is convex upward the adsorbent has a higher selectivity for cs than na as shown in fig 7a verm cit has a higher selectivity for cs than na fig 7b shows the variation of the vanselow selectivity coefficient k v nacs of verm cit the value of ln k v nacs was 3 2 0 6 and suggesting high selectivity for cs than for na when cs and coexisting ions were included in equivalent amounts the adsorption capacity was decreased slightly by these monovalent cations about 2 to 10 the presence of divalent cations was more affected than monovalent cations but it was 30 in the presence of 10 fold coexisting ions relative to cs the adsorption capacity was decreased by 20 30 for monovalent cations and 50 60 for divalent cations fig 8a typically the higher the valence of the ion the stronger the interaction with the adsorbent so it was considered that the divalent ions interfered more strongly with the adsorption capacity of verm cit in the case of humic acid coexistence the cs adsorption capacity of verm cit did not change in each concentration as shown in fig 8b it seems that the cs adsorption by vermiculite is not affected apparently by organic impurities like humic substance however wei et al reported that cs could be adsorbed on humic substances covering the surface of the clay mineral 43 therefore the effect of humic substances on adsorption capacity in fig 8b might include the amount of cs adsorbed at humic substance on the surface of verm cit 3 6 adsorption kinetics of ag verm and ag verm cit the adsorption of cs by the powder form verm was discussed before and the performance of the adsorbent encapsulated in ag beads will be described in this section fig 9a shows the adsorbed amount of cs by ag verm and ag verm cit at various contact times the parameters of adsorption kinetics are indicated in table s4 both ag verm and ag verm cit were described by the pseudo second order model the ipd kinetics model indicated the three stage adsorption in ag verm and ag verm cit similar to powder verm and verm cit fig 9b the adsorption capacity of ag without verm was 1 02 mg g in this study this small capacity was also reported in the previous study 36 therefore the adsorption capacity of ag verm and ag verm cit was significantly affected by the encapsulated vermiculite yielding a similar adsorption behavior section 3 4 moreover fig s1 shows that the layered structure of verm was observed after encapsulation with ag the encapsulated verm significantly contributes to adsorption while maintaining its structure compared with powdered verm and verm cit showed in fig 4 the time to reach equilibrium was longer and the equilibrium time was over 360 min after one month of contact the adsorption capacity was 84 8 and 98 5 mg g in ag verm and ag verm cit respectively which were almost unchanged after two months of contact typically the adsorption rate of bead like adsorbent tends to decrease because it needs a step in which the adsorbate diffuses inside of the adsorbent 44 in this study since cs should pass through the alginate gel network before cs contacts with the encapsulated verm cit the equilibrium adsorption time increased and the slope of the ipd kinetics model became gentler these results indicate that the contact efficiency between verm or verm cit and cs was reduced by encapsulation in ag beads however ag verm cit could adsorb 60 5 mg g even in 30 min and a relatively higher adsorption capacity was achieved the ft ir spectra of ag verm cit have a pattern in which the peaks of ag and verm cit are superimposed fig 10a alginate has the main absorption band at around 1620 and 1425 cm 1 attributed to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching of the carboxyl group 45 these absorption bands can be also found in the ft ir of ag verm cit and thus cs has a possibility to be adsorbed by the interaction with the carboxyl group but the adsorbed amount was actually low as mentioned before the adsorption capacity of alginate beads for cs was only 1 02 mg g in this study the x ray diffractograms of ag verm cit have a reflection at a similar degree approximately 7 7 to that of the verm cit although that was not a clear reflection compared to the powder form verm cit after cs adsorption fig 10b this result indicates that the basal spacing of ag verm cit also narrows accompanying cs adsorption similarly to the verm cit since the diameter of the developed alginate gel vermiculite ag verm or ag verm cit is approximately 3 mm 100 of the recovery rate can be achieved by using mesh under 3 mm a tea strainer with 0 5 mm mesh was used to collect adsorbent in our experiment and the recovery rate was 100 since the wastewater can easily pass through 0 5 mm mesh without clogging the separation of adsorbents and treated water is effortless and fast moreover as shown in fig s7 the volume of ag verm cit can be reduced by air drying without heating the diameter decreased to 1 3 mm from 3 mm with a weight loss of 88 when this adsorbent was considered a sphere its volume reduced to approximately one sixteenth based on this observation the volume of the adsorbent that has adsorbed the pollutant can be significantly reduced by air drying this property will contribute to the stable management of adsorbents with radionuclides such as vitrification and geological disposal 3 7 comparison with previous studies we compared our adsorbent with previous studies table 1 and ag verm cit has a similar or higher adsorption capacity than previous studies as mentioned in section 3 5 it requires a longer time to reach equilibrium adsorption still the adsorption capacity at 30 min was 60 5 mg g a large amount of cs could be adsorbed within a short contact time although some reported adsorbents have larger adsorption capacity than our adsorbent these adsorbents require various pretreatments during preparation 18 19 and are heated at 550 c to reduce the volume of the adsorbent 19 moreover since many of the reported adsorbents are powder form after cs adsorption adsorbents were separated by filtration 18 19 25 46 47 however the filtration of powder form adsorbents is a challenge in terms of practical application as one of the solutions to this challenge it is conceivable to encapsulate the adsorbent into beads it has been reported that chitosan and polyacrylonitrile are used in addition to alginate and magnetite is added to enable magnetic separation 16 48 49 however these bead like adsorbents also have disadvantages such as the requirement for heating the complex manufacturing procedure and the use of reagents with a load on wastewater treatment in this regard our adsorbent allows us to easily separate cs from contaminated water due to the encapsulation in ag bead which offers several advantages including easy preparation and low environmental impact by changing the substances contained in the ag beads broader applications for the adsorption of various pollutants are possible these bead encapsulated adsorbents are promising materials because they are derived from nature and can significantly contribute to the development of water treatment technology 4 conclusions a collectable adsorbent with a low environmental impact was developed using verm and ag beads to remove cs from an aquatic environment sodium citrate can remove the interlayer material and improve the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent the adsorption capacity increased to 119 mg g verm cit from 97 1 mg g verm we concluded that the sodium citrate treatment increase the adsorption capacity of verm we also conferred collectability to our adsorbent by encapsulating verm and verm cit in ag beads although this encapsulation led to a longer equilibrium time ag verm cit still had a large adsorption capacity 60 5 mg g even within a short contact time 30 min moreover the volume of ag verm cit can easily be reduced by air drying and the generation of sludge in the treatment of contaminated water containing cs can be

12779,this study aimed to develop a collectable adsorbent for cs using clay mineral and alginate gel the adsorption capacity of vermiculite verm for cs increased from 97 1 mg g to 119 mg g after sodium citric treatment the verm used in this study has a partial chlorite structure and the existence of interlayer material was considered the adsorption sites of verm for cs increased because the interlayer material in the partly chlorite structure was removed via sodium citric treatment the langmuir adsorption isotherm described this adsorption phenomenon well indicating that the adsorption of cs by verm after sodium citric treatment verm cit is monolayer adsorption since a typical phenomenon was also observed in which the basal spacing became approximately 1 0 nm when cs was adsorbed by the interlayer of vermiculite the interlayer of verm cit functioned as an adsorption site verm cit was encapsulated in alginate gel beads ag verm cit for accessible collection after adsorption although the equilibrium adsorption time of ag verm cit was extended from 10 min without encapsulation verm cit to over 360 min an adsorption capacity of 60 5 mg g was obtained even after 30 min the developed adsorbent requires time to reach equilibrium however the adsorption capacity was similar to or higher than reported in previous studies even with a relatively shorter contact time additionally the weight and volume of the adsorbent encapsulated in alginate gel beads can be decreased by air drying without heat these properties can contribute to removing cs from the aquatic environment and to the stable management of adsorbents with radionuclides graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords adsorbent vermiculite sodium citrate treatment alginate gel bead cesium data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction hazardous substances that significantly impact the ecosystem and human activity must be removed before they diffuse into the environment while many technologies have already been developed adsorption offers the advantage of ease of handling and versatile performance for various coloring substances and many kinds of pollutants it has been applied to multiple fields such as food processing agriculture and fishery 1 3 especially in water treatment many characteristic adsorbents have been developed to remove various heavy metals and dyes 4 7 alkali metal ions such as cs and k have high solubility even in basic conditions to be collected as precipitates of hydroxides therefore separation using some adsorbents is considered effective for alkali metals radioactive species were discharged into the environment during the fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant accident in japan on march 11 2011 in particular 137cs have a long half life of approximately 30 years and continue to impact the environment thus it is necessary to remove 137cs from waste solutions and transform it into a stable and manageable form in addition to waste solutions contaminated soils estimated to total 13 14 million m3 also require treatment 8 chemical treatment methods such as ion exchange 9 thermal treatment 10 and washing with an inorganic 11 or organic acid 12 have been investigated to reduce the volume of contaminated soils after elution of the radionuclides from these soils using wet methods radionuclides have to be removed from the treated water finally some methods have been developed to remove cs from a large amount of wastewater using adsorbents membranes and columns 13 15 for the adsorption of cs many materials such as prussian blue copper hexacyanoferrate pan crown ether functionalized wood cellulosic etc have been investigated 16 19 to enhance the adsorption capacity the treatment of adsorbents with high temperatures acids organic solvents and sometimes complex procedures have been conducted however the energy requirement for heating and the use of considerable amounts of chemicals for the preparation limit their practical application therefore developing adsorbents prepared from ubiquitous materials without additional energy and particular chemicals is desired to treat waste solutions additionally adsorbents should have a significant adsorption capacity good operability low environmental impact and easy management after adsorptive separation the intense interaction between cs and clay minerals has been previously reported cs have been considered to be adsorbed in the interlayer or frayed edge site fes of clay minerals 20 21 in fukushima prefecture japan biotite and vermiculite a weathered product of abukuma granite were distributed in the soil over the whole prefecture to selectively adsorb radioactive cs 22 the cs ions bound with biotite and vermiculite are not easily desorbed because of the formation of an inner sphere complex with the interlayer or fes 23 this irreversible adsorption property of clay minerals for cs is advantageous in the stable management of radionuclides cs can be stored as it is permanently adsorbed in the clay mineral therefore some clay mineral based adsorbents for radioactive cs have been investigated 24 26 alginic acid a natural organic substance in seaweed is commonly used to encapsulate adsorbents in powder form 27 29 for instance montmorillonite encapsulated in an alginate gel bead has been investigated for the removal of cs 30 this adsorbent was modified with lithium to enhance the selectivity for cs however lithium is not a cheap material for such modification procedures we found that the adsorption capacity of the vermiculite distributed over fukushima prefecture to adsorb cs increased after treatment with sodium citric without heating in this paper we aimed to develop a novel collectable composite adsorbent by encapsulating vermiculite in alginate gel beads for cs removal from aquatic environments based on a simple concept not requiring external energy and with a low environmental impact 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials vermiculite verm a 2 1 type phyllosilicate clay mineral from ishikawa gun fukushima prefecture japan geo science materials nichika inc kyoto japan was used in this study sodium

purchased from kanto chemical co inc tokyo japan humic acid sodium salt was purchased from sigma aldrich co mo usa these chemicals were used without any pretreatment 2 2 preparation and characteristics of verm the verm was crushed using an agate mortar to a particle size smaller than 53 μm since vermiculite clay sometimes forms a mixed layer with chlorite we identified the verm in this study following procedure typically given that the basal spacing of vermiculite clay is known to decrease from 1 4 nm to 1 0 nm by the adsorption of k in the interlayer 31 the structural change of verm was observed before and after the adsorption of k namely verm 0 1 g was saturated with 25 ml of 1 0 mol l kcl solution three times the verm sample was filtered 5c 1 μm pore size toyo roshi kaisha ltd tokyo japan and washed with distilled water after filtration the verm on the filter paper was dried at 105 c for 16 h yamato constant temperature oven dk 62 yamato scientific co ltd tokyo japan the prepared verm was characterized using x ray diffraction xrd smartlab rigaku corporation tokyo japan using cu kα radiation λ 0 154 nm at 40 kv and 30 ma with a speed of 1 min and an angular step of 0 01 the chemical composition of verm was measured using an energy dispersive x ray fluorescence spectrometer xrf jsx 3100rii jeol ltd tokyo japan and the carbon content was measured using a chns elemental analyzer vario el cube elementar langenselbold germany the adsorbents were characterized using fourier transform infrared spectra ft ir spectrum 100 perkinelmer usa in atr method the morphology of the adsorbent was examined using a scanning electron microscope jsm 6610la jeol ltd tokyo japan at 20 kv accelerating voltage 2 3 treatment with sodium citrate typically the interlayer material such as the hydroxyl sheet that exists in the interlayer of chlorite can be removed by sodium citrate treatment 32 here this procedure was partially modified to improve the adsorption capacity of the verm briefly verm was dispersed into 0 3 mol l sodium citrate solution ph 8 0 at a 1 200 solid liquid ratio the mixture was shaken at 150 rpm at various temperatures and for different contact times and the verm sample was filtered using filter papers 5c the concentrations of al fe mg and si in the filtrate were measured using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy icp aes icps 8100 shimadzu corporation kyoto japan the sample on the filter paper was dried at 105 c for 16 h and the treated verm verm cit was used to perform the adsorption experiment 2 4 adsorption experiments adsorption experiments were conducted using verm and verm cit the verm or verm cit 0 05 g was added to 25 ml of cs solution and the mixture was shaken at 150 rpm at 25 c br 40lf taitec corporation saitama japan the mixture was filtered using filter paper 5c and cs concentration in the filtrate was measured using a flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas za 3000 hitachi high tech corporation tokyo japan the adsorption capacity q was calculated using eq 1 1 q c 0 c e v w where q is the adsorption capacity mg g c 0 and c e are the initial and equilibrium concentrations of cs mg l v is the volume of solution l and w is the weight of the adsorbent g the effects of sodium citrate treatment temperature and time were evaluated based on the obtained adsorption capacity for cs the xrd of the adsorbent after cs adsorption was measured and assessed for the basal spacing the solution ph was measured using a ph meter d 51 horiba ltd kyoto japan the adsorption experiment was operated under various conditions of cs concentrations ph and contact times the effect of ph was evaluated using a csoh solution prepared at various ph values adjusted with hcl to avoid interfering with na the adsorption kinetics was evaluated using the pseudo first order pseudo second order elovich and intraparticle diffusion ipd kinetics models and the adsorption isotherms were evaluated using the langmuir and freundlich isotherm models the details of the model equations are provided in the supporting information 2 5 ion exchange isotherm the ion exchange isotherm is useful for evaluating the selectivity of the adsorbent 33 35 and was used for the developed adsorbent verm cit sodium prepared using chloride salt was used as the competing ion the prepared solution contained cs and na in various proportions the total normality of cs and na was 5 mmol l the adsorption experiment was carried out using the procedure described in section 2 4 the concentrations of cs and na in the filtrate were measured using aas and were used to calculate the ratio of cs in the solution and soil the vanselow selectivity coefficient k v nacs was calculated using eq 2 35 2 k nacs v csx na nax cs where csx and nax are mole fractions in the exchange phase of clay mineral and na and cs are present activities calculated using visual minteq version 3 1 when there is non preference in the exchange between cations the value of k v nacs is unity 2 6 preparation of ag verm cit beads clay minerals have a large adsorption capacity however as they are powder they are difficult to collect after the adsorption of pollutants therefore we attempted to encapsulate verm and verm cit in alginate gel ag beads the ag verm and ag verm cit were prepared according to the following procedure verm or verm cit was added to distilled water and powdered sodium alginate 1 wt while stirring with a magnetic stirrer if distilled water is added to the sodium alginate powder first or clay minerals are added to the prepared sodium alginate solution it does not disperse well the prepared ag verm or ag verm cit solution was dripped into 0 1 mol l cacl2 solutions using a peristaltic pump mp 1000 tokyo rikakikai co ltd tokyo japan through a silicon tube id 3 mm with a luer fitting vrm306 nordson medical corporation westlake oh usa at the tip the dripping speed was approximately 2 ml min almost 30 drops min a cacl2 solution containing ag beads was continuously stirred with a magnetic stirrer for 3 h for the bead maturation 36 fig 1 then the prepared ag verm and ag verm cit beads were used for adsorption experiments the procedure is the same as in section 2 4 and twenty five beads were added to 25 ml of 500 mg cs l solution ph 6 0 as ag beads include water molecules it is difficult to compare the adsorption capacities of ag beads with powder form adsorbents therefore the prepared ag beads were lyophilized to obtain the dry weight fdu 1200 tokyo rikakikai co ltd tokyo japan which was used to calculate the adsorption capacities of ag verm and ag verm cit 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristic of verm the morphology of verm is shown in fig s1 verm has a layered structure like common clay minerals the chemical composition and x ray diffractograms of verm used in this study are shown in table s1 and fig s2 the carbon content of verm was below the quantitative lower limit of the chns elemental analyzer 0 2 the verm used in this study had a 1 4 nm of basal spacing fig s2 a typical property of vermiculite clay although the basal spacing of verm generally becomes 1 0 1 1 nm after k saturation 31 verm was kept at a basal spacing of 1 4 nm fig s3 chlorite also a phyllosilicate clay mineral has a sheet like interlayer material in the interlayer and the basal spacing does not narrow after k saturation because vermiculite clay and chlorite are often produced as mixtures the verm used in this study probably has a partial chlorite structure 3 2 condition of the sodium citrate treatment the conditions for sodium citrate treatment were investigated to improve the adsorption capacity of verm fig 2a shows the adsorption capacity for cs at each treatment temperature and original indicates the adsorption capacity of verm without any treatment in a previous study sodium citrate treatment was conducted at 100 c for 6 h to remove the interlayer material of the chlorite 32 in this study the adsorption capacity of verm was improved even at 25 c for 6 h and this capacity was constant up to 80 c the adsorption capacity did not change at various treatment periods at 25 c fig 2b fig 2c shows the x ray diffractograms of verm original and verm cit which adsorbed cs in each sodium citrate treatment period at 25 c although the basal spacing of verm original became 1 24 nm after cs adsorption the basal spacing of verm cit was 1 15 nm after any treatment time the basal spacing of clay minerals was known to be around 1 0 nm due to cs adsorption 37 these results suggest that more cs can penetrate into the interlayer as the interlayer material of verm was removed by sodium citrate treatment as a result the cs adsorption capacity is improved fig 2d shows the eluted elements from the verm by sodium citrate treatment the most eluted element by sodium citrate treatment was mg almost the same amount of mg was eluted even in the treatment with 0 3 mol l nacl fig 2d this result suggests that the eluted mg is an ion exchangeable form and is not an element that constitutes the interlayer material the next most eluted element was si the amount eluted with nacl treatment was estimated to derive from soluble silicate as an impurity in verm the third most eluted element was al which was not eluted with nacl the interlayer material eluted with sodium citrate could be identified as a 1 1 type clay mineral or 2 1 type clay mineral like structure based on the si al molar ratio in the eluent 38 the si al molar ratio in the eluent was calculated by subtracting the amount of si eluted with nacl fig s4 the si al molar ratio was 1 8 1 9 in this study the interlayer material could be regarded as the 2 1 type clay mineral like structure 38 the obtained conditions for the sodium citrate treatment were 25 c and 2 h of treatment which is enough to enhance the adsorption capacity of verm the interlayer material was removed in a shorter time than in previously reported studies 32 because the verm used in this study was relatively weathered and only had a partial chlorite structure the morphology of verm was unaltered before and after sodium citrate treatment fig s1 and the structure of verm was constant 3 3 effect of the removal of interlayer material on cs adsorption the effects of the removal of the interlayer material on cs adsorption were evaluated the si al molar ratio should be 2 1 in 2 1 type clay mineral without any isomorphous substitution the adsorbed cs has existed in the hollow of six membered rings on a tetrahedral sheet of clay mineral since the si forming the six membered ring is shared with an adjacent six membered ring the ratio of si and cs should be 2 1 in the clay mineral after cs adsorption when cs were fixed in the interlayer of clay minerals cs were held between two tetrahedral sheets and the ratio of si and cs became 4 1 here the eluted interlayer material with sodium citrate treatment was a 2 1 type clay mineral like structure the al and si molar ratio in the eluent should be similar to the ratio in the 2 1 type clay mineral structure since the ratio of si and al of 2 1 type clay mineral is 2 1 the molar ratio of eluted al cs should be 2 1 since the concentration of al was 0 020 mmol g after the 2 h sodium citrate treatment the available adsorption sites for cs were calculated to be 0 010 mmol g due to the removal of the interlayer material directly the increased adsorption capacity for cs of verm due to the 2 h sodium citrate solution treatment was 22 mg g 0 17 mmol g by subtracting the capacity of untreated verm from the capacity of sodium citrate treated verm this calculation indicates that the adsorbed cs were around 17 times higher than the estimated capacity the adsorption for cs on the verm occurred not only where the interlayer material was removed but also on sites that became accessible due to the removal of the interlayer material if the interlayer material is on the edge of the clay mineral and mg ions are located far from the edge the interlayer material interferes with cs adsorption and mg ions cannot be exchanged with cs since most of the al was not eluted by nacl treatment fig 2d nacl did not affect the removal of the interlayer material thus the increase mg concentration observed after nacl treatment was likely due to the elution of exchangeable mg ions from the verm with interlayer material the accessible adsorption site due to the removal of interlayer material with the sodium citrate treatment was estimated by subtracting the amount of mg eluted following nacl treatment from the amount of mg eluted with sodium citrate treatment the eluted amount of mg after the 2 h sodium citrate treatment was 0 51 mmol g and that after nacl treatment was 0 44 mmol g the accessible adsorption site was estimated to be 0 07 mmol g the adsorbed amount of cs increased by 0 17 mmol g due to 2 h sodium citrate treatment since the adsorption capacity of 0 010 mmol g was due to the removal of the interlayer material indicated above the increased adsorption capacity except for the direct effect of removing the interlayer material was calculated to be 0 16 mmol g the ion exchange ratio considering these charges should ideally be 1 2 and an exchange ratio of mg and cs was 1 2 2 in this study mg in the interlayer is exchanged with na derived from sodium citrate treatment and cs is adsorbed in the interlayer by exchanging with na in the interlayer from these calculations it can be concluded that the adsorption sites generated by the sodium citrate treatment include two types the first one is the sites directly occupied by the interlayer material and the second one is sites containing mg ions that were inaccessible due to the presence of the interlayer material fig 3 although the treatment with citric acid reportedly enhances the adsorption capacity of adsorbents made from leaf due to the modification of carboxylic groups 39 the carbon content of verm cit in this study was below the quantitative lower limit 0 2 before and after the sodium citrate treatment moreover the amount of carboxyl group on the verm cit was evaluated by the calcium acetate method 40 and the carboxyl group was not detected on the verm cit the amount of surface acidic functional group was evaluated by the gran plot 41 verm and verm cit was 0 28 and 0 33 mmol g respectively verm cit had a slightly higher value than verm however it was not so high moreover since the ft ir spectra of verm and verm cit was no significant difference fig s5 the special functional groups are not modified on the surface of the verm by sodium citrate treatment these results indicated that the enhancement of the adsorption capacity of verm after sodium citrate treatment was due to the removal of the interlayer material and not to the modification of specific functional group like carboxylic groups by citric acid 3 4 adsorption kinetics of verm and verm cit the adsorption capacities of verm and verm cit at each contact time are shown in fig 4 the elovich model described well the adsorption kinetics of verm and the pseudo second order model described the adsorption kinetics of verm cit table s2 since verm is a natural product and has interlayer materials it fitted the elovich model with a heterogeneous surface the ipd kinetics model indicated the three stage adsorption in verm and verm cit fig s6 the first stage is rapid adsorption due to the interaction between cs and the surface of clay minerals the second stage is slow adsorption due to the penetration and diffusion of cs into the mineral structure similar behavior has been reported in a previous study 25 the third stage is slow distribution and reaching equilibrium the adsorption isotherm was evaluated at a condition of contact time of 24 h fig 5 the langmuir adsorption isotherm well described the cs adsorption in both verm and verm cit table s3 monolayer adsorption was considered the adsorption of cs by clay minerals with a large basal spacing follows the langmuir adsorption isotherm the cs and interlayer sites have strong interactions and the ratio of adsorption in the interlayer was the highest in the total adsorption capacity 42 since an equal amount of na as the adsorbed cs is eluted from verm cit the adsorption of cs is due to ions exchangeable with na fig 6 shows the adsorption capacity under various ph conditions cs speciation was evaluated using visual minteq version 3 1 cs existed as cs between ph 2 12 in this adsorption experiment condition the adsorption capacity of verm was approximately 80 100 mg g under neutral and basic conditions but decreased sharply at ph 2 this tendency was the same for the verm cit clay minerals have both variable and permanent charges the variable charge depends on the ph condition typically its charge becomes negatively strong under basic conditions and h neutralizes it under acidic conditions therefore the variable charge could not contribute to the cs adsorption under low ph conditions and the adsorption capacity decreased at ph 2 the difference between the adsorption capacities at ph 2 and 6 was approximately 40 mg g in both verm and verm cit corresponding to the variable charge amount verm cit had a large adsorption capacity 75 1 mg g even at ph 2 the negative charge generated by removing the interlayer material was immediately neutralized by na derived from sodium citrate since cs were adsorbed by ion exchange with na in the interlayer the adsorption capacity increased by the amount that the interlayer material was removed from the interlayer 3 5 selectivity the ion exchange isotherm of verm cit was used to evaluate selectivity for cs and na if the isotherm is convex upward the adsorbent has a higher selectivity for cs than na as shown in fig 7a verm cit has a higher selectivity for cs than na fig 7b shows the variation of the vanselow selectivity coefficient k v nacs of verm cit the value of ln k v nacs was 3 2 0 6 and suggesting high selectivity for cs than for na when cs and coexisting ions were included in equivalent amounts the adsorption capacity was decreased slightly by these monovalent cations about 2 to 10 the presence of divalent cations was more affected than monovalent cations but it was 30 in the presence of 10 fold coexisting ions relative to cs the adsorption capacity was decreased by 20 30 for monovalent cations and 50 60 for divalent cations fig 8a typically the higher the valence of the ion the stronger the interaction with the adsorbent so it was considered that the divalent ions interfered more strongly with the adsorption capacity of verm cit in the case of humic acid coexistence the cs adsorption capacity of verm cit did not change in each concentration as shown in fig 8b it seems that the cs adsorption by vermiculite is not affected apparently by organic impurities like humic substance however wei et al reported that cs could be adsorbed on humic substances covering the surface of the clay mineral 43 therefore the effect of humic substances on adsorption capacity in fig 8b might include the amount of cs adsorbed at humic substance on the surface of verm cit 3 6 adsorption kinetics of ag verm and ag verm cit the adsorption of cs by the powder form verm was discussed before and the performance of the adsorbent encapsulated in ag beads will be described in this section fig 9a shows the adsorbed amount of cs by ag verm and ag verm cit at various contact times the parameters of adsorption kinetics are indicated in table s4 both ag verm and ag verm cit were described by the pseudo second order model the ipd kinetics model indicated the three stage adsorption in ag verm and ag verm cit similar to powder verm and verm cit fig 9b the adsorption capacity of ag without verm was 1 02 mg g in this study this small capacity was also reported in the previous study 36 therefore the adsorption capacity of ag verm and ag verm cit was significantly affected by the encapsulated vermiculite yielding a similar adsorption behavior section 3 4 moreover fig s1 shows that the layered structure of verm was observed after encapsulation with ag the encapsulated verm significantly contributes to adsorption while maintaining its structure compared with powdered verm and verm cit showed in fig 4 the time to reach equilibrium was longer and the equilibrium time was over 360 min after one month of contact the adsorption capacity was 84 8 and 98 5 mg g in ag verm and ag verm cit respectively which were almost unchanged after two months of contact typically the adsorption rate of bead like adsorbent tends to decrease because it needs a step in which the adsorbate diffuses inside of the adsorbent 44 in this study since cs should pass through the alginate gel network before cs contacts with the encapsulated verm cit the equilibrium adsorption time increased and the slope of the ipd kinetics model became gentler these results indicate that the contact efficiency between verm or verm cit and cs was reduced by encapsulation in ag beads however ag verm cit could adsorb 60 5 mg g even in 30 min and a relatively higher adsorption capacity was achieved the ft ir spectra of ag verm cit have a pattern in which the peaks of ag and verm cit are superimposed fig 10a alginate has the main absorption band at around 1620 and 1425 cm 1 attributed to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching of the carboxyl group 45 these absorption bands can be also found in the ft ir of ag verm cit and thus cs has a possibility to be adsorbed by the interaction with the carboxyl group but the adsorbed amount was actually low as mentioned before the adsorption capacity of alginate beads for cs was only 1 02 mg g in this study the x ray diffractograms of ag verm cit have a reflection at a similar degree approximately 7 7 to that of the verm cit although that was not a clear reflection compared to the powder form verm cit after cs adsorption fig 10b this result indicates that the basal spacing of ag verm cit also narrows accompanying cs adsorption similarly to the verm cit since the diameter of the developed alginate gel vermiculite ag verm or ag verm cit is approximately 3 mm 100 of the recovery rate can be achieved by using mesh under 3 mm a tea strainer with 0 5 mm mesh was used to collect adsorbent in our experiment and the recovery rate was 100 since the wastewater can easily pass through 0 5 mm mesh without clogging the separation of adsorbents and treated water is effortless and fast moreover as shown in fig s7 the volume of ag verm cit can be reduced by air drying without heating the diameter decreased to 1 3 mm from 3 mm with a weight loss of 88 when this adsorbent was considered a sphere its volume reduced to approximately one sixteenth based on this observation the volume of the adsorbent that has adsorbed the pollutant can be significantly reduced by air drying this property will contribute to the stable management of adsorbents with radionuclides such as vitrification and geological disposal 3 7 comparison with previous studies we compared our adsorbent with previous studies table 1 and ag verm cit has a similar or higher adsorption capacity than previous studies as mentioned in section 3 5 it requires a longer time to reach equilibrium adsorption still the adsorption capacity at 30 min was 60 5 mg g a large amount of cs could be adsorbed within a short contact time although some reported adsorbents have larger adsorption capacity than our adsorbent these adsorbents require various pretreatments during preparation 18 19 and are heated at 550 c to reduce the volume of the adsorbent 19 moreover since many of the reported adsorbents are powder form after cs adsorption adsorbents were separated by filtration 18 19 25 46 47 however the filtration of powder form adsorbents is a challenge in terms of practical application as one of the solutions to this challenge it is conceivable to encapsulate the adsorbent into beads it has been reported that chitosan and polyacrylonitrile are used in addition to alginate and magnetite is added to enable magnetic separation 16 48 49 however these bead like adsorbents also have disadvantages such as the requirement for heating the complex manufacturing procedure and the use of reagents with a load on wastewater treatment in this regard our adsorbent allows us to easily separate cs from contaminated water due to the encapsulation in ag bead which offers several advantages including easy preparation and low environmental impact by changing the substances contained in the ag beads broader applications for the adsorption of various pollutants are possible these bead encapsulated adsorbents are promising materials because they are derived from nature and can significantly contribute to the development of water treatment technology 4 conclusions a collectable adsorbent with a low environmental impact was developed using verm and ag beads to remove cs from an aquatic environment sodium citrate can remove the interlayer material and improve the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent the adsorption capacity increased to 119 mg g verm cit from 97 1 mg g verm we concluded that the sodium citrate treatment increase the adsorption capacity of verm we also conferred collectability to our adsorbent by encapsulating verm and verm cit in ag beads although this encapsulation led to a longer equilibrium time ag verm cit still had a large adsorption capacity 60 5 mg g even within a short contact time 30 min moreover the volume of ag verm cit can easily be reduced by air drying and the generation of sludge in the treatment of contaminated water containing cs can be
