5990,quasi periodic sampling and analysis of spring water were conducted at nine sites to investigate the effects of the 2016 kumamoto earthquake on the major chemical composition including hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopic ratios of spring waters transient increases in the concentrations of nitrate in spring waters were observed at seven sites in may 2016 one month after the earthquake this was the first time that this phenomenon had been observed on such a large scale the magnitude of the increase in nitrate concentration was 0 7 2 4 mg l equivalent to 10 93 of the concentration before the earthquake furthermore precipitation data showed that heavy rain of over 70 mm day occurred 5 days after the mainshock rainwater is thought to have transported nitrate from shallow underground soil to the groundwater aquifer through cracks caused by strong shaking during the earthquake strong shaking also caused damage to the plants decreasing the amount of nitrate they absorbed and this is thought to be one of the reasons for the increase in nitrate concentration in the springs keywords the 2016 kumamoto earthquake post seismic hydrological changes nitrate concentration spring water 1 introduction spring water can be an important water resource in areas affected by earthquakes because it is available when water supply is interrupted by power failures or damaged pipes this situation occurred after the 2016 kumamoto earthquake nojima and maruyama 2016 the emergency use of spring water in such circumstances motivates studies of post earthquake changes to spring water quality nitrate no3 is an indicator of pollution in groundwater groundwater affected by agricultural runoff such as pesticides and fertilizers and domestic wastewater contains high concentrations of no3 freeze and cherry 1979 kumazawa 2002 rivett et al 2008 increased no3 concentrations in shallow groundwater from the kumamoto area had been reported and interpreted as a consequence of such pollution hosono et al 2013 tomiie et al 2009 specifically no3 concentrations exceeding 10 mg l were detected from nearly half the wells in both in the confined aquifer depth 60 200 m and the unconfined aquifer depth 0 50 m in the kumamoto area hosono et al 2013 however earthquake related no3 pollution is also a major concern therefore it is important that the causes of earthquake related changes in spring water quality be determined there are previous reports of changes in the chemical composition of spring water associated with earthquakes barberio et al 2017 malakootian and nouri 2010 manga and rowland 2009 rosen et al 2018 rutter et al 2018 sato and takahashi 1997 schuessler et al 2016 in new zealand increases in the concentrations of no3 and e coli in groundwater were observed after an earthquake and interpreted as temporary contamination from surface water rutter et al 2018 e coli is a group of bacteria found in the intestine of warm blooded organisms and an indicator of fecal contamination in the environment there are several reports on the increase in no3 concentration in groundwater caused by rainfall e g huebsch et al 2014 kawagoshi et al 2019 wang et al 2015 but there are few reports of such changes due to earthquakes we detected a temporary rise in the no3 concentration of spring water at seven sites one month after the 2016 kumamoto earthquake this is the first report of simultaneous changes in no3 concentration on such a large scale 40 km fig 1 a series of earthquakes occurred in the kumamoto region of southern japan in april 2016 foreshocks of mw 6 2 and mw 6 0 occurred on april 14 2016 jst utc 9 and april 15 respectively kato et al 2016 fig 1 the mw 7 0 mainshock occurred on april 16 the depth of the epicenters in all cases was 10 km and strong shaking destroyed more than 8000 houses on the kumamoto plain and in the aso area ushiyama et al 2016 the seismic activity was initiated by movement on two right lateral fault zones the foreshocks were associated with movement on the hinagu fault zone and the mainshock was associated with movement on the futagawa fault zone fig 1 a total fault slip of 34 km was observed on the surface shirahama et al 2016 as part of an ongoing survey program we conducted a water sampling survey in march 2016 one month before the earthquake for which we sampled seven springs located near the hinagu and futagawa fault zones a f and j in fig 1 two springs g and h in the aso area had previously been sampled in 2014 sampling pre and post earthquake enabled recognition of earthquake related changes in the major chemical composition of spring water 2 materials and methods this study focuses on analyses of spring water from nine sites on the kumamoto plain and aso caldera fig 1 the kumamoto area is covered by quaternary pyroclastic flow deposits from the mount aso volcano and hosts a shallow groundwater aquifer formed from pyroclastic flow deposits shimano 2000 taniguchi et al 2003 we surveyed nine spring water sites within the pyroclastic flow deposits 0 5 1 and 1 5 months after the 2016 kumamoto earthquake and every few months thereafter table 1 three of the springs a b j are located within the hinagu fault zone three other springs c d e are within the futagawa fault zone one spring f lies at the foot of the mount aso somma and two springs g h lie within the aso caldera springs c d and e are located in the fault zone where surface ruptures formed during the earthquake in 2016 the water temperature and ph were measured in the field using the ebro tfx 410 thermometer xylem analytics uk ltd and the laqua d 74 ph meter horiba ltd respectively the flow rate of each spring was measured by the total amount method using a bag at sites a b c and h by the float method using a water channel at sites d e f and g it could not be measured at site j for structural reasons spring water was collected using polyethylene bottles and the major chemical compositions and hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopic ratios δd and δ18o were analyzed in the laboratory the major chemical composition was analyzed using ion chromatography ics 2100 thermo fisher scientific inc and the δd and δ18o were analyzed via mass spectrometry delta v advantage and delta plus thermo fisher scientific inc and cavity ringdown spectrometry l2120 i picarro inc the analysis precision for delta v advantage is 1 for δd that for delta plus is 0 1 for δ18o and those for l2120 i are 0 6 for δd and 0 1 for δ18o 3 results 3 1 characteristics of spring water on a piper diagram spring waters from springs a b d e f and j were classified as ca hco3 type g and h were classified as ca so4 type and c was classified as an intermediate between ca hco3 and ca so4 types fig 2 these results are consistent with those of nagai et al 1986 and shimano 2000 typical shallow groundwater in this area is ca hco3 type shimano 2000 therefore the water from springs a b d e f and j is typical in this area springs g and h are ca so4 type it has been proposed that this reflects an influence of sulfur bearing volcanic gases and volcanic deposits associated with the mount aso volcano nagai et al 1986 according to shimano 2000 spring c is an intermediate type because water from the shira river is present in its recharge area the shira river flows from the aso caldera to the kumamoto plain and consequently has ca so4 type water characteristics that reflect the influence of volcanic gases and deposits associated with the mount aso volcano the δd and δ18o of the spring waters were ploted between two lines calculated using the δd and δ18o of rainwater in the kumamoto area where δd 8 4 δ18o 11 7 and δd 8 5 δ18o 19 5 as shown in fig 3 tanoue et al 2009 these results are consistent with spring waters derived from precipitation in this area the values of δd and δ18o decrease in the order a b j c d e f g and h this reflects the relative elevations of the samples table 1 with lower δd and δ18o at higher elevations in general groundwater recharged at high altitudes has relatively low δd and δ18o and this trend due to recharge altitude is referred to as the altitude effect waseda and nakai 1983 the δd and δ18o values of springs g and h are thought to be the lowest because mt aso the highest peak in this area is located in their recharge area spring f shows higher δd and δ18o values than springs g and h despite being at a higher altitude this indicates that the average recharge altitude of spring f is lower than those of springs g and h furthermore the d excess value δd 8 δ18o of spring f is the highest because its ratio of recharge due to winter rain is higher than in other areas fig 3 3 2 temporal changes temporal changes in flow rates relative to the pre earthquake flow rate were investigated fig 4 a earthquake related changes in flow rate including those that occurred during the post earthquake observation period were observed at several springs however the observations were insufficiently frequent to distinguish between the effects of the earthquake annual fluctuations and other factors that affect the flow rates therefore it was not possible to determine the magnitude of changes in the flow rate caused by the earthquake temporal changes in the relative concentration of the major element compositions na ca2 mg2 cl hco3 so4 2 no3 in spring water relative to pre earthquake concentrations were investigated fig 4b and 5 the concentration of no3 in samples of the seven springs taken one month after the earthquake was 10 93 higher than the corresponding pre earthquake values fig 4b the increase in no3 is inferred to have occurred even in the springs where data was not collected one month before the earthquake e f the increase in no3 concentration for all springs was 0 7 2 4 mg l table 1 subsequent to the increase the no3 concentration decreased by 20 in many springs between fall 2016 and fall 2017 changes in no3 concentrations of this magnitude have not been documented previously however none of the other chemical constituents show a change that corresponds to that of no3 the largest variation was observed in the concentration of the mg2 data from one spring showed a drop in mg2 concentration of 20 in the fall of 2016 changes in cl so4 2 and na in all spring waters were less than 10 fig 5 the value of δ18o shows annual fluctuation but did not change significantly in response to the earthquake fig 4c however as with the flow rate the spatial resolution of data is insufficient to resolve changes related to an annual cycle and changes due to the earthquake with confidence 4 discussion changes in groundwater quality associated with earthquakes have been observed around the world barberio et al 2017 malakootian and nouri 2010 manga and rowland 2009 rosen et al 2018 rutter et al 2018 sato and takahashi 1997 schuessler et al 2016 for example increases in the concentrations of no3 and e coli after an earthquake have been attributed to contamination of shallow groundwater rutter et al 2018 however this is the first study to document a case where no3 was the only affected species therefore it is necessary to explain this phenomenon no3 in groundwater originates from sewage fertilizers and plant residue added to the soil and surface waters freeze and cherry 1979 rivett et al 2008 such groundwater contamination has been reported on the kumamoto plain kumazawa 2002 therefore the documented increase in no3 is likely to have been caused by addition of no3 from shallow underground sources it has been reported that no3 concentration in groundwater increases with rainfall e g huebsch et al 2014 kawagoshi et al 2019 wang et al 2015 this is thought to be because no3 moves from shallow underground soil to the groundwater aquifer along with the infiltration of rainfall in particular kawagoshi et al 2019 reported an increase in no3 concentration from 10 mg l to 20 mg l after a rainfall of 89 mm day at mashiki in the kumamoto region fig 1 in july 2014 kawagoshi et al 2019 fig 6 shows precipitation in aso otohime mashiki and kosa from march to september 2016 japan meteorological agency 2019 on april 21 2016 5 days after the mainshock of the 2016 kumamoto earthquake precipitation reached over 70 mm day at all observation sites in particular rainfall in mashiki reached 89 mm day which is the same amount that accounted for the above mentioned increase in no3 concentration recorded in kawagoshi et al 2019 precipitation data from the japan meteorological agency 2019 also shows that since july 1 2015 when precipitation reached 135 5 mm day in mashiki it had been below 89 mm day for nine months until april 21 2016 the rainfall of april 21 2016 may have resulted in an increase in the no3 concentration of spring water as shown in fig 6a however no increase in no3 concentration was observed during subsequent heavy rainfall in particular it rained over 100 mm day within the last month in august 2017 and within the last week in july 2018 fig 4d both of which were during survey period table 1 yet there was no increase in no3 we consider that the following two mechanisms took place for no3 to flow out only during the rainfall that occurred just after the earthquake the first is the generation of cracks due to strong shaking during the earthquake changes in the hydrological environment are caused by changes in water permeability in the vertical direction due to generation of cracks associated with earthquakes e g wang et al 2004 wang et al 2016 wang and manga 2015 such a phenomenon may increase the reaction area of the soil or rock with groundwater and make it easier for no3 to flow into the groundwater we suggest that most of the no3 on the surface of the new cracks flowed out with the first heavy rain after the earthquake the second mechanism is the damage to plants caused by the strong shaking nitrate concentration in groundwater rises after forest felling kubin 1998 neal et al 1992 ruiz et al 2002 the reason is thought to be that felling stops the absorption of no3 by trees as a result of which no3 flows into the groundwater indeed many trees fell around spring d due to the ruptures caused by the earthquake this phenomenon is thought to occur not only in trees but also in weeds and will disappear as vegetation recovers after the earthquake this study is the first to report the rise of no3 concentration in spring water after a series of earthquakes along a distance of 40 km we suggest that this phenomenon was observed widely due to the coincidence of the two above mentioned mechanisms and the heavy rain that occurred five days after the earthquake this result shows the possibility of clarifying the anomalous recharge situation of groundwater immediately after an earthquake using no3 concentration as a tracer our study is thought to be constrained by the following two conditions strong ground shaking by the earthquake and heavy rain immediately after the earthquake 5 conclusion the major chemical composition and δd and δ18o of spring water from nine springs near the fault zones in the kumamoto area were analyzed after sampling on multiple occasions between march 2016 and july 2018 with two measurements taken in 2014 an increase in the no3 concentration was detected in seven springs after the april 2016 kumamoto earthquake the concentration of no3 peaked approximately one month after the earthquake with an increase of 0 7 2 4 mg l above pre earthquake levels equivalent to a relative increase of 10 93 in the kumamoto area heavy rain exceeding 70 mm day fell 5 days after the mainshock in addition the earthquake may have caused cracks in the ground and damage to plants that commonly absorb no3 we suggest that the combination of these two phenomena resulted in the first ever wide range increase in no3 concentration observed in spring water after earthquake possibilities for further work include measurements of stable nitrogen isotopes to further investigate the source of no3 furthermore an increased frequency of post earthquake sampling might enable better resolution of the hydrological parameters that control shallow groundwater recharge and flow declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

5991,most studies of particulate transport have been performed in porous and permeable media of uniform pore size such as sandstones and sandpacks carbonates often contain large openings called vugs which can affect the flow and transport properties particle straining of the porous medium here we perform straining experiments on artificial vuggy media with two different vug distributions changes in porosity permeability vug size and particle effluent volume are monitored using pressure measurements and computed tomography ct scanning we find that vugs that are parallel to the flow direction behave independently with retention profiles similar to single vugs of the same volume khan et al 2019 for vugs in series different retention profiles are observed in each vug and injected particles penetrate deeper in the series vug configuration we perform flow simulations for both configurations and find the experimentally observed particle deposition is consistent with changes in the flow streamlines in particular retention is enhanced where streamlines converge which in turns alters the vug size and straining potential of the porous medium over time keywords vuggy media carbonate

cities of austin and san antonio it is a karstic limestone with multiple layers of highly heterogeneous porous rocks formed by leaching of evaporitic and reefal deposits creating pre dominantly small inter particle intra particle and inter crystalline pores maclay and small 1983 maclay 1995 ferrill et al 2004 the limestone rock matrix is reactive to the groundwater and releases sediments which are transported within the aquifer mahler et al 1999 furthermore rapid transportation of groundwater with little time for subsurface filtration of particulates occurs through the karstic features sharp and banner 1997 opsahl et al 2018 and introduces surface solids into the aquifer these solid sediments can get trapped and jam the flow pathways present in the rock jegatheesan and vigneswaran 2005 thereby reducing the inherent permeability of the rock this reduction of the rock permeability is also called formation damage civan 2015 and can reduce the flow capabilities of the aquifer over time formation damage caused by fines movement has been studied extensively maroudas and eisenklam 1965 heertjes and lerk 1967 herzig et al 1970 gruesbeck and collins 1982 mirabolghasemi et al 2015 khan et al 2017 with focus on particle straining by the process of size exclusion and surface deposition herzig et al 1970 suggests straining is the dominant mechanism when infiltrate particle diameter is greater than 30 μm surface deposition is more prominent for smaller sized infiltrate smaller injected particle to medium grain ratio as surface forces such as electrostatic and van der waals forces become significant fig 1 numerous studies herzig et al 1970 gruesbeck and collins 1982 bailey et al 2000 moghadasi et al 2004 bedrikovetsky et al 2001 al abduwani 2005 khan et al 2017 have measured the filtration processes in homogeneous media like sandstones and glass bead packs but not much attention has been afforded to heterogeneous systems like carbonates carbonates are complex rocks with a wide range of porosity and pore size distribution reeder 1983 friedman and ali 1981 ahr et al 2005 clyde and wade 2013 vugs pore openings on a larger length scale are a prominent feature in carbonates and contribute significantly to the local porosity of the rock however permeability strongly depends on vug connectivity a high contrast exists between the two length scales i e the size of the vug and the pore size which results in a heterogeneous flow solomon et al 1997 zhang et al 2004 making it difficult to discern the particle retention patterns in a vuggy porous medium furthermore the vugs evolve over time due to solid retention which changes the flow patterns and ultimately the overall straining potential of the rock a previous study khan et al 2019 looked at vug changes and changes in matrix deposition for a single vug it showed that the injected particles partially fill up the vug and are deposited in the matrix surrounding the vug the particles penetrate deeper inside the porous medium and a higher particle deposition higher porosity loss is observed in the vug surroundings relative to the matrix with no vug the area of influence of the vug is measured at approximately 1 5 times the vug diameter the question that arises next is how would the particle deposition patterns vary in the vug and in the matrix when we have more than one vug here we study the effects of multiple vugs on particle deposition the simplest spatial distributions possible for two vugs in a porous medium are two vugs in parallel or two vugs in series relative to the direction of fluid flow we synthesize glass bead 1 0 mm cores with the desired porosity and vug structures and inject smaller sized glass beads 25 and 100 μm at different total injected particle concentrations 0 5 1 and 2 and different flow rates 40 and 60 ml min the particle size ratios have been selected such that straining is the prominent deposition mechanism khan 2016 the total injected particle concentration and flow rate are selected in line with those commonly found in literature where researchers have used total injection concentrations ranging from 0 5 to 3 barkman and davidson 1972 allen and robinson 1993 mirabolghasemi et al 2015 al taq et al 1837 khan et al 2017 khan et al 2019 the flow rates have been selected based on the reynolds number 4 found in entrapment literature bailey et al 2000 mirabolghasemi et al 2015 al abduwani 2005 al abduwani et al 2003 khan et al 2017 herzig et al 1970 we measure the continuous pressure drop and therefore the permeability change along the core and collect the effluent fluid we scan the pre flood and post flood core in a computed tomography scanner 250 μm resolution to get an estimate of the porosity change and the particle deposition patterns in the matrix and vugs the aim of this study is to identify the influence of vug vug interaction and the vug spatial distribution on the particle deposition patterns in the vug and the surrounding matrix this work has not focused on creating a mathematical model over the three years that we have studied this problem a simple mathematical model has not proven to be feasible khan et al 2016 khan et al 2017 yang and balhoff 2017 yang 2018 multiscale modeling approaches have been tried khan et al 2017 with limited success based on the previous work done on modeling particulate flow in homogeneous porous media mirabolghasemi et al 2015 mirabolghasemi 2017 we know that a more detailed numerical model in vuggy media is computationally demanding and the extent of the work is thus beyond the scope of this paper we find that vugs in series affect the particle deposition patterns of each other with variations in porosity profile observed the vugs in parallel i e vugs at the same depth inside the porous medium have no discernible impact on the particle retention behavior of each other similar deposition pattern and therefore porosity profile is observed in either vug implying that the separation between the vugs is larger than their area of influence 2 methods 2 1 experimental methods vugs are created in sintered glass bead packs 1 0 mm diameter by adding dissolvable salt inclusions wrapped in cheesecloth to a 1 0 mm glass bead mixture placed in a graphite mold 35 9 mm id 77 7 mm depth and sintering in a muffle furnace at 725 c in the presence of air flooding the core after cooling clears any cheesecloth residue left behind from the combustion process and dissolves the salt creating 12 mm diameter spherical vugs alternatively the vugs can be created by the method prescribed in khan et al 2018 two new vuggy core configurations are created fig 2 with the same total vug volume two equal sized vugs in series and two equal sized vugs in parallel relative to the direction of flow fig 3 the two vugs in the parallel configuration are arbitrarily named vug 1 and vug 2 while the two vugs in series are named upper and lower vug based on their spatial location the depth of the vugs is chosen such that the geometric center of the two vug system is the same to simplify the reference to these vuggy core configuration from here on we will be referring to these as the series and parallel configuration respectively the cores act as proxy rock for core flood experiments equal volumes of 25 μm and 100 μm glass bead fine suspensions are injected in the top down direction in the core at three total injection concentrations 0 5 1 and 2 v v and two flow rates 40 and 60 ml min resulting in six unique flow conditions table 1 for each core type the total volume of injected particles is kept constant for all experiments and is equal to the pore volume of a homogeneous core 27 cm 3 in line with the volumes injected in the previous experiments in homogeneous and vuggy porous media khan et al 2019 khan et al 2017 pv si t can be defined as the ratio of total volume of the solid infiltrates injected at time t to the total pore volume the total injection time for a specific injection concentration and flow rate for constant solid volume injected can be calculated by keeping 0 t inj pv si dt 1 in eq 1 1 pv si t q c total ϕ v b t where pv si pore volume occupied by the solid infiltrate dimensionless v b core bulk volume cm3 ϕ total core porosity dimensionless q fluid flow rate cm3 min t time min c total total injected particle concentration vol four parameters are measured for each experiment 1 vug volume reduction the vugs are extraced from the ct images 8 bit by the sequential application of filters segmentation and fiji imagej s longair 2013 built in find connected regions algorithm with 26 connectivity the image stack is segmented using the otsu method which calculates the threshold for each slice based on the histogram the vug in itself is easy to segment due to the large difference in gray values between the void vug space and the matrix fig 4 and subsequently makes it straightforward to quantify the vug filling the difference between the pre flood and post flood ct stack results in the vug volume change caused by particle deposition and the 3d reconstruction of the difference gives a qualitative description of the spatial deposition of particle with respect to the vug fig 5 b sensitivity analysis and more details about the procedure can be found at khan et al 2019 2 porosity change pre and post flood porosity of each core is measured using an in house multiple energy modified medical computed tomography ct scanner universal systems hd 350e at a resolution of 250 microns the difference in the gray values between the two sets of images gives the change in porosity eq 2 caused by particle deposition during the experiment 2 δ ϕ ct after ct before ct glass ct water 3 permeability change over time three pressure taps inlet middle and outlet are connected to the core and continuously log differential pressure measurements in the top inlet and middle and bottom middle and outlet part of the core the continuous pressure trace is converted to a continuous permeability trace using darcy s law 4 total particle effluent the total effluent volume is collected filtered twice using a 10 μ m filter paper dried and weighed the solid mass in the total effluent gives a measure of the ratio of injected particles deposited in the porous medium a material balance calculation is performed on the total injected particles and porosity change to ratify the total effluent particle collected the experimental workflow setup schematics and detailed procedure is outlined in khan et al 2019 in brief the core is first fabricated with the desired vug configuration and installed in the core hanger fig 6 a pre flood ct scan of the core is acquired in the medical ct scanner at a resolution of 250 μm different concentrations of 25 and 100 μm glass bead suspension are injected in the fabricated core at different fluid flow rates in the top down direction the effluent is collected and the filtered twice to remove and isolate the suspended particles continuous pressure recordings are acquired during the injection phase in the three equidistant pressure transducers to give a continuous permeability trace a post flood ct scan of the fabricated core is acquired combination of this with the pre flood scan results in the porosity reduction and the vug volume change the complete experimental process is outlined in fig 7 2 2 streamline simulation a 2d cmg imex cmg 2015 simulation is set up to understand the change in streamlines caused by the spatial distribution of vugs this simulation is neither modeling the particle deposition process nor measuring the change in the vug volume but it is set up to gain an insight into streamlines taken by the injected particles by solving the darcy s law equation for the vug matrix system the difference between flow in matrix and in vug is not only the domain size but also the dimension flow in matrix can be assumed as 1d but flow in vug is 3d in nature in particular cases it can be simplified to 2d sophisticated models such as the brinkman equation darcy s law in the matrix and stokes equation in the vug are required to model the flow in vug matrix system and would be an appropriate approximation to resolve the flow inside the vug in more detail however it is more computationally involved and we are assessing the first order approximation of the problem nair 2008 jia et al 2013 and more interested in the interactions happening at the vug matrix interface rather than inside the vug both approaches hold the same assumptions on the flow small reynolds number but have different level of detail in the vugs vs matrix the problem is simplified to a quasi 2d system using a cartesian grid 74 131 1 with two cuboidal vugs combined vug volume equal to the single vug volume in khan et al 2019 no grid refining is used the reservoir is saturated with single phase water with pressure greater than the bubble point pressure single phase fluid water is injected from the top end and produced from the bottom end at a constant flow rate of 3280 bbl day upscaled from 60 ml min the flow rate is calculated by keeping the spatial and temporal upscaling ratio the same the vug has a porosity of 99 compared to 41 6 for the matrix while the permeability of the vug is two orders of magnitude greater than the surrounding matrix 200 md since the vug size is one order of magnitude larger than the pore size and the permeability scales as a square with the pore size the vug permeability is chosen to be two order of magnitude larger 20 000 md than the matrix permeability cmg input parameters are presented in table 2 3 results 3 1 vug volume change previous measurements of a single vug khan et al 2019 in porous medium showed that the outer surface of the vug was first filled with particles smoothing the vug surface therefore a large damage was observed in the middle cross section of the vug the maximum damage was observed at the bottom end of the vug for multiple vug configurations the vug volume change due to particle entrapment for each vug at different flow conditions is presented in table 3 vug 1 and vug 2 in the parallel configuration are named arbitrarily as both the vugs are of a similar shape and size and are placed at the same depth inside the core for a steady state system with a uniform influx of particles the two parallel vugs expectedly show a similar loss in vug volume and a similar deposition profile fig 8 for each flow condition upper and lower vug in the series are named according to their spatial locations inside the core a complete or partial 50 fill up of vugs is observed in two instances fig 9 both of them in the series configuration the lower vug in vs4020 is completely filled up while the upper vug in vs6010 is partially filled for the partially filled vug we observe that the sides of the vug in a cross section are filled up and a fluid pathway is present through the center of the vug for the series configuration the spatial location of maximum damage is not the same in the upper and lower vug the upper vug generally has a maximum volume loss in the middle of the vug while the lower vug generally has a maximum loss at the top of the vug this is an interesting observation which tells us about the difference in streamlines and therefore the particle movement observed by each vug the flow carrying the injected particles enters the upper vug from all sides and loses the particles at the vug matrix interface the flow then channels from the upper vug to the lower vug and the particles are deposited at the top part matrix between the two vugs of the lower vug for the parallel configuration the maximum vug volume change is observed in the middle cross section of the vug fig 8 which is inline with the results observed for a single vug this implies that the injected particles and therefore the streamlines are entering the vug from all the sides and not only from the top the middle slice through the spherical vug has the largest perimeter and would therefore have a higher deposition of particles resulting in maximum damage for either vug configuration at 0 5 and 1 total injected particle concentration the higher flowrate has a larger vug volume loss than in the corresponding vug at the lower flowrate and the opposite is observed for the 2 total injected particle concentration where the lower flowrate has a higher vug volume loss 3 2 porosity porosity results calculated across the cross section are presented in fig 10 the first and last scans are ignored as they are prone to boundary errors the porosity change can be defined into three zones i above the top of the upper vug ii top of the upper vug to the bottom of the lower vug and iii below the bottom of the lower vug generally a higher loss in porosity is observed in series configuration than in parallel configuration i e more particles have deposited in the porous medium for the series configuration for series configuration fig 10a the first zone has an average porosity change of 10 and is a function of the total injected particle concentration the lowest concentration has the lowest change while the highest concentration has the middle change a similar behavior is observed in the second zone with the highest porosity reduction observed in the middle of the vugs as evident from the vug volume change as well fig 8 at each concentration the higher flowrate results in more porosity loss the third zone does not depend on the flow rate with the lowest average porosity change of 8 an anomaly is observed for the experiment vs4010 which shows a consistently high porosity drop 16 at all depths for parallel configuration fig 10b the first zone is thicker than the series configuration as the vugs are placed deeper inside the formation it shows a lower porosity loss compared to the series configuration with little variation and shows no dependency on flow conditions this can be explained a larger cross sectional area of the vug in the case of parallel configuration resulting in a higher flow deviation caused by the vugs experiment vp4020 acts as the anomaly with a large porosity loss 10 that increases with depth the second zone shows a higher porosity loss at the top with the porosity loss reducing as we go deeper again no flow dependency is evident in the porosity loss even though the spread is higher compared to the same zone in the series configuration fig 10a porosity loss in the third zone shows a dependency on the flow conditions and depth the highest total injection concentration results in the lowest change in porosity 0 which reduces with depth the middle concentration results in the highest porosity loss 7 which remains uniform with depth while the lowest concentration results in the middle porosity drop 4 which increases with depth an anomaly is observed for the experiment vp4020 where the porosity drop at the near injection face is the highest at 10 and remains higher than any of the others until it crosses the middle of the vugs 3 3 permeability temporal changes in pressure are measured in the top and bottom zones for the series and parallel configuration converted to permeability and normalized with reference to the initial core permeability for each flow case the total solid volume injected is equal to the pore volume of a clean homogeneous core eq 1 resulting in 0 t inj pv si dt 1 normalized permeability for each experiment is plotted against the solid infiltrate pore volume pv si for the top and bottom zones in figs 11 and 12 respectively the top zone permeability is plotted on a logarithmic scale due to the large variations in permeability generally a decrease in permeability over time is observed for all the experiments an initial large drop in permeability is observed in the top zone whereas a delayed permeability drop response is observed in the bottom zone for each individual experiment the top zone permeability drop is larger than the bottom zone permeability drop the top zone permeability versus time in the series configuration is plotted in fig 11a the permeability profile can be divided into two sections i a high gradient with time permeability drop at initial time and ii a gentler constant gradient in the logarithmic scale at later times the point of inflection in the permeability profile is observed at two different time values short duration 0 04 pvsi with 50 permeability loss and long duration 0 1 pvsi with 85 permeability loss the short duration inflection point is present for the 0 5 and 1 injected particle concentration while the long duration inflection point is observed for highest injected particle concentrations 2 0 the same rate of permeability decline is observed for all the short duration cases and experiment vs6020 experiment vs4020 is the anomaly in this case and shows a lower rate of permeability decline the maximum damage by the end of injection i e permeability loss is observed at the highest concentration and highest flow rate the same zones in the parallel configuration yields different permeability profiles fig 11b two general trends are observed i constant gradient decline for the low flow rates 40 ml min and ii an initial high gradient decline followed by a gentler gradient decline for the high flow rate 60 ml min the first trend shows a lower damage by the end of injection up to a maximum of 75 permeability loss for experiment vp4020 with damage increasing with the total injected particle concentration the second trend shows the opposite behavior with generally a higher permeability loss which is inversely related to the total injected particle concentrations the maximum damage 95 permeability loss is observed for the experiment vp6005 a delayed response in the permeability loss in the bottom zone is observed in both the core configurations fig 12 two possibilities for this happening are 1 the larger sized injected particles are initially deposited on the inlet face of the core forming an external filter cake and in the top zone this blocks all the subsequent particles which are large enough to deposit by individually 100 μm glass beads from getting to the bottom zone after a certain thickness of the external filter cake is generated a higher pressure drop is required for the fluid to get inside the matrix this results in shifting of the loosely packed glass beads that form the external filter cake thereby creating wormhole like structures in the external filter cake which allows passage for the fluid and suspended particles inside the porous medium 2 the initial suspension mixture contains the large particles only which cannot get to the bottom zone the subsequent suspension mixture contains a combination of the two particle sizes from which the smaller sized particles get to the bottom zone we believe the first possibility is more likely based on our observation of the suspension mixture having both the particle sizes from the very start and presence of small external filter cake in some experiments the bottom zone permeability versus time in the series configuration is plotted in fig 12a a parabolic decline is observed for all the experiments small differences are observed in the starting point for the 0 5 and 1 total injection concentration which is less than the starting point for the 2 total injection concentration all the experiments result in 40 50 loss in permeability by end of injection the bottom zone versus time for the parallel configuration yields almost no change in permeability for most cases with the highest change being 20 for experiment vp6010 fig 12b this is consistent the low changes in porosity fig 10b observed in the bottom zone a point to note here is that this zone is devoid of the vug unlike the three zones mentioned before top and bottom zone in the series configuration and the top zone in the parallel configuration as evidenced from the initial core porosity profile fig 3 3 4 effluent particulate volume the collected effluent is filtered twice dried and weighed the deposition parameter eq 3 is calculated for each experiment where the total injected particle volume mass for each experiment is the controlling factor and is kept the same 3 deposition m inj m eff m fc m inj 100 where m inj injected particle mass g m eff effluent particle mass g and m fc filter cake mass g the data is plotted in fig 13 for all the experiment cases a general observation can be made about the relative particle deposition in the series and parallel configurations the highest total injected particle concentration 2 results in a higher deposition for the parallel configuration while the other total injected particle concentrations 0 5 and 1 have a higher deposition in the series configuration for the parallel configuration blue colors in fig 13 a direct relation between deposition and total injected particle concentration in observed at constant flowrate an increase in total injected particle concentration results in an increase in particle deposition changing the flowrate only has an impact on deposition at the lowest total injected particle concentration the other concentrations show very little variation the same is not true for the series configuration red colors in fig 13 for a constant flowrate the deposition at the highest and lowest total injected particle concentrations 0 5 and 2 show similar results while the 1 experiments show different values at the lower flowrate more deposition is observed for the experiments with 1 total injected particle concentration compared to the other two concentrations 0 5 and 2 the opposite is observed for the higher flowrate where the 1 total injection concentration has the lowest deposition compared to the other concentrations 3 5 streamline simulation this quasi 2d simulation has been setup to gain an insight into the streamline changes caused by the presence of series parallel vugs reduction in vug permeability and decrease in the vug size this simulation does not model any particulate flow but gives us an indication of how the streamlines change with a change in permeability which are helpful in better understanding the spatial distribution of the particulate deposition streamlines white are generated and plotted over the core blue in series fig 14 and parallel configuration fig 15 the vug with 100 times the core permeability is colored red we find that increasing the permeability greater than a factor of 100 has no significant effect on the streamline deviation as a critical threshold has been achieved and the maximum flow that can be diverted to the vugs has been achieved the initial spatial location of the vug in the series and parallel configuration is shown in figs 14a and 15a respectively at steady state with native reservoir properties each vug occupies 24 of the cross section streamlines at the top of the vug tend to converge and we observe that 43 of the streamlines are redirected towards the upper vug in the series configuration fig 14 this results in a streamline convergence sc factor defined as the number of streamlines entering the vug per unit length of 0 43 0 24 1 78 the sc factors have been calculated for all the scenarios studied in figs 14 and 15 and are shown in table 4 for the series configuration the upper vug always has a higher sc factor compared to the lower vug i e more flow is redirected towards the upper vug in comparison with the lower vug simulating particle entrapment by reducing the vug permeability i e enhancing the permeability contrast between the porous bed and vug reduces the sc factor to 1 67 and 1 56 in the upper and lower vug respectively if the vug size is reduced by one pixel on the sides and three pixels at the bottom 34 volume reduction a sc factor of 1 63 is achieved in both the vugs since the parallel configuration is mirrored along the space in the center of the two vugs equal sc factors should be observed we always observe a higher sc factor in the left vug table 4 which is an error possibly caused by the low density of streamlines plotted therefore for the parallel configuration we will only consider the combined effect of the vugs for the parallel configuration the neighboring vugs compete for flow therefore each simulation scenario results in a lower sc factor compared to the series configuration steady state conditions with native reservoir properties results in a sc factor of 1 61 which reduces to 1 33 and 1 47 for the vug permeability reduction and vug size reduction respectively in summary the vug permeability reduction i e permeability contrast reduction has a more pronounced effect on the parallel configuration 20 change in sc factor compared to 6 and 9 in the upper and lower vug in series configuration while the vug size reduction has the least effect on the lower vug in series configuration 5 change in sc factor 4 discussion we integrate the results for the vug volume change porosity permeability and effluent particulate volume and compare the formation damage between the single vug and dual vugs in series configuration and parallel configuration again the total vug volume for a single vug is the same as the sum of the total vug volume of the two vugs in series and parallel configuration and the geometric center of the single vug and the two dual vug configurations is the same as mentioned above surface deposition is more prominent for smaller sized infiltrate particle size where surface forces such as electrostatic and van der waals forces become significant in this study we have utilized larger sized particles and straining is the prominent mechanism of deposition we start the discussion by highlighting the results obtained for a single vug khan et al 2019 the vug causes injected particles to deposit deeper inside the core maximum particle deposition happens at the extremes of the vug and more particle deposition occurs in the matrix around a vug for the series vug configuration we observe a deeper penetration of injected particles compared to the single vug fig 10a a higher vug volume loss table 3 a maximum vug volume loss at the upstream end of the vug and a larger volume of injected particle retention in the core combined effect in matrix and vug the simulation results show a convergence of streamlines at the inlet of the vug fig 14b with 45 of the streamlines entering 24 of the cross section combining the experimental and simulation results we believe that the main phenomenon by which the greater number of injected particles deposit at the upstream end of the vug in a series configuration is fluid flow focusing in the radial center of the vug prior to entry inside the vug this is primarily due to the permeability contrast between the vug and the matrix this convergence of flow increases the particle particle and particle grain collisions which ultimately results in particles falling out of the fluid flow pathways and depositing in the matrix neat the vug boundary the fluid passes through the vug and diverges at the downstream end and then it exits the vug at this point the lower vug causes the fluid to again converge towards the radial center of the vug prior to entering the lower vug and is potentially why we observe complete or partial fill ups near the downstream end of the upper vug and the upstream end of the lower vug fig 9 we again observe a jump in the vug volume loss at the upstream end of the lower vug the meandering of the streamlines along the depth is also why we observe a deeper deposition of injected particles in the series configuration and a higher volume of particles retained in the core results for the parallel vug configuration are different in comparison with the series configuration we observe a shallower penetration of particles fig 10b a lower vug volume loss and the maximum vug volume is lost at the center cross section of the vug the simulation results again show a convergence of flow at the upstream end of the parallel vugs fig 15b but here the two parallel vugs compete among each other and dilute the effect an individual vug table 4 the fluid flow focusing behavior as observed in the series configuration is reduced here and the flow is not centered towards the radial center of the core most injected particles are not deposited at the upstream end of the vug s and penetrate below the top of the vug with increasing depths up to the center cross section the perimeter of the vug increases and the effect of the other vug is minimized the streamlines converge towards the vug resulting in a larger particle retention in the middle cross section across the vug a similar vug volume loss across all depths is observed in both the vugs in the parallel configuration fig 8 therefore we believe that each vug acts independently as a single vug combining the above results we can deduce that fluid flow focusing is more prominent in the series configuration and results in a higher particle deposition at the upstream end of the vug each vug in parallel acts independently as a separate vug with the separation between the vugs greater than their sphere of influence and therefore does not dictate the deposition of injected particles in the other vug continuing along the same lines if there is no overlap in the spheres of influence of the two parallel vugs each vug will only affect the particles that are within its sphere of influence if the sphere of influence of the two vugs overlap the particle will be affected by both the vugs with the dominance depending on the distance between the particle and the vug at this point we would like to point out that having solid retention profiles at different times would be highly desirable but unfortunately in this setup we only have the pre flood and post flood ct scans and therefore the temporal distribution of the particle concentration breakthrough concentrations vug volume change and porosity change cannot be reconstructed vuggy carbonates have a plethora of vugs which are not arranged in either a series or parallel manner with respect to the flow but are a combination of the two the formation damage effect in carbonates would therefore be a combination of the two as well with the shallower vugs retaining particles and focusing flow for the deeper vugs which in turn would do the same for more deeper vugs parallel vugs at the same depth inside the formation would act as separate vugs and not influence the retention pattern in the other vugs the question that remains is would any connected vug act as a flow focuser regardless of the vug configuration 5 conclusion the evolution of flow patterns due to particle entrapment and its effect of particle deposition in vuggy permeable media have been studied combining the results mentioned above we can conclude that for two vugs of similar shape and volume present in a uniform porous medium i the vugs in series focus the flow and increase the depth of particle deposition and the total volume of particles deposited in the core and ii the vugs in parallel acts independently as separate vugs with their separation greater than their individual sphere of influence and do not dictate the deposition of injected particles fluid flow focusing is an important factor in particle transport and deposition in a vuggy permeable medium and therefore needs to be incorporated in the modeling of particle transport in vuggy porous media to get a realistic picture of

5991,most studies of particulate transport have been performed in porous and permeable media of uniform pore size such as sandstones and sandpacks carbonates often contain large openings called vugs which can affect the flow and transport properties particle straining of the porous medium here we perform straining experiments on artificial vuggy media with two different vug distributions changes in porosity permeability vug size and particle effluent volume are monitored using pressure measurements and computed tomography ct scanning we find that vugs that are parallel to the flow direction behave independently with retention profiles similar to single vugs of the same volume khan et al 2019 for vugs in series different retention profiles are observed in each vug and injected particles penetrate deeper in the series vug configuration we perform flow simulations for both configurations and find the experimentally observed particle deposition is consistent with changes in the flow streamlines in particular retention is enhanced where streamlines converge which in turns alters the vug size and straining potential of the porous medium over time keywords vuggy media carbonate

the edwards aquifer in south central texas composed of a heterogeneous limestone group inter bedded with sand gravel sediments maclay and small 1983 supplies water for about two million people in the cities of austin and san antonio it is a karstic limestone with multiple layers of highly heterogeneous porous rocks formed by leaching of evaporitic and reefal deposits creating pre dominantly small inter particle intra particle and inter crystalline pores maclay and small 1983 maclay 1995 ferrill et al 2004 the limestone rock matrix is reactive to the groundwater and releases sediments which are transported within the aquifer mahler et al 1999 furthermore rapid transportation of groundwater with little time for subsurface filtration of particulates occurs through the karstic features sharp and banner 1997 opsahl et al 2018 and introduces surface solids into the aquifer these solid sediments can get trapped and jam the flow pathways present in the rock jegatheesan and vigneswaran 2005 thereby reducing the inherent permeability of the rock this reduction of the rock permeability is also called formation damage civan 2015 and can reduce the flow capabilities of the aquifer over time formation damage caused by fines movement has been studied extensively maroudas and eisenklam 1965 heertjes and lerk 1967 herzig et al 1970 gruesbeck and collins 1982 mirabolghasemi et al 2015 khan et al 2017 with focus on particle straining by the process of size exclusion and surface deposition herzig et al 1970 suggests straining is the dominant mechanism when infiltrate particle diameter is greater than 30 μm surface deposition is more prominent for smaller sized infiltrate smaller injected particle to medium grain ratio as surface forces such as electrostatic and van der waals forces become significant fig 1 numerous studies herzig et al 1970 gruesbeck and collins 1982 bailey et al 2000 moghadasi et al 2004 bedrikovetsky et al 2001 al abduwani 2005 khan et al 2017 have measured the filtration processes in homogeneous media like sandstones and glass bead packs but not much attention has been afforded to heterogeneous systems like carbonates carbonates are complex rocks with a wide range of porosity and pore size distribution reeder 1983 friedman and ali 1981 ahr et al 2005 clyde and wade 2013 vugs pore openings on a larger length scale are a prominent feature in carbonates and contribute significantly to the local porosity of the rock however permeability strongly depends on vug connectivity a high contrast exists between the two length scales i e the size of the vug and the pore size which results in a heterogeneous flow solomon et al 1997 zhang et al 2004 making it difficult to discern the particle retention patterns in a vuggy porous medium furthermore the vugs evolve over time due to solid retention which changes the flow patterns and ultimately the overall straining potential of the rock a previous study khan et al 2019 looked at vug changes and changes in matrix deposition for a single vug it showed that the injected particles partially fill up the vug and are deposited in the matrix surrounding the vug the particles penetrate deeper inside the porous medium and a higher particle deposition higher porosity loss is observed in the vug surroundings relative to the matrix with no vug the area of influence of the vug is measured at approximately 1 5 times the vug diameter the question that arises next is how would the particle deposition patterns vary in the vug and in the matrix when we have more than one vug here we study the effects of multiple vugs on particle deposition the simplest spatial distributions possible for two vugs in a porous medium are two vugs in parallel or two vugs in series relative to the direction of fluid flow we synthesize glass bead 1 0 mm cores with the desired porosity and vug structures and inject smaller sized glass beads 25 and 100 μm at different total injected particle concentrations 0 5 1 and 2 and different flow rates 40 and 60 ml min the particle size ratios have been selected such that straining is the prominent deposition mechanism khan 2016 the total injected particle concentration and flow rate are selected in line with those commonly found in literature where researchers have used total injection concentrations ranging from 0 5 to 3 barkman and davidson 1972 allen and robinson 1993 mirabolghasemi et al 2015 al taq et al 1837 khan et al 2017 khan et al 2019 the flow rates have been selected based on the reynolds number 4 found in entrapment literature bailey et al 2000 mirabolghasemi et al 2015 al abduwani 2005 al abduwani et al 2003 khan et al 2017 herzig et al 1970 we measure the continuous pressure drop and therefore the permeability change along the core and collect the effluent fluid we scan the pre flood and post flood core in a computed tomography scanner 250 μm resolution to get an estimate of the porosity change and the particle deposition patterns in the matrix and vugs the aim of this study is to identify the influence of vug vug interaction and the vug spatial distribution on the particle deposition patterns in the vug and the surrounding matrix this work has not focused on creating a mathematical model over the three years that we have studied this problem a simple mathematical model has not proven to be feasible khan et al 2016 khan et al 2017 yang and balhoff 2017 yang 2018 multiscale modeling approaches have been tried khan et al 2017 with limited success based on the previous work done on modeling particulate flow in homogeneous porous media mirabolghasemi et al 2015 mirabolghasemi 2017 we know that a more detailed numerical model in vuggy media is computationally demanding and the extent of the work is thus beyond the scope of this paper we find that vugs in series affect the particle deposition patterns of each other with variations in porosity profile observed the vugs in parallel i e vugs at the same depth inside the porous medium have no discernible impact on the particle retention behavior of each other similar deposition pattern and therefore porosity profile is observed in either vug implying that the separation between the vugs is larger than their area of influence 2 methods 2 1 experimental methods vugs are created in sintered glass bead packs 1 0 mm diameter by adding dissolvable salt inclusions wrapped in cheesecloth to a 1 0 mm glass bead mixture placed in a graphite mold 35 9 mm id 77 7 mm depth and sintering in a muffle furnace at 725 c in the presence of air flooding the core after cooling clears any cheesecloth residue left behind from the combustion process and dissolves the salt creating 12 mm diameter spherical vugs alternatively the vugs can be created by the method prescribed in khan et al 2018 two new vuggy core configurations are created fig 2 with the same total vug volume two equal sized vugs in series and two equal sized vugs in parallel relative to the direction of flow fig 3 the two vugs in the parallel configuration are arbitrarily named vug 1 and vug 2 while the two vugs in series are named upper and lower vug based on their spatial location the depth of the vugs is chosen such that the geometric center of the two vug system is the same to simplify the reference to these vuggy core configuration from here on we will be referring to these as the series and parallel configuration respectively the cores act as proxy rock for core flood experiments equal volumes of 25 μm and 100 μm glass bead fine suspensions are injected in the top down direction in the core at three total injection concentrations 0 5 1 and 2 v v and two flow rates 40 and 60 ml min resulting in six unique flow conditions table 1 for each core type the total volume of injected particles is kept constant for all experiments and is equal to the pore volume of a homogeneous core 27 cm 3 in line with the volumes injected in the previous experiments in homogeneous and vuggy porous media khan et al 2019 khan et al 2017 pv si t can be defined as the ratio of total volume of the solid infiltrates injected at time t to the total pore volume the total injection time for a specific injection concentration and flow rate for constant solid volume injected can be calculated by keeping 0 t inj pv si dt 1 in eq 1 1 pv si t q c total ϕ v b t where pv si pore volume occupied by the solid infiltrate dimensionless v b core bulk volume cm3 ϕ total core porosity dimensionless q fluid flow rate cm3 min t time min c total total injected particle concentration vol four parameters are measured for each experiment 1 vug volume reduction the vugs are extraced from the ct images 8 bit by the sequential application of filters segmentation and fiji imagej s longair 2013 built in find connected regions algorithm with 26 connectivity the image stack is segmented using the otsu method which calculates the threshold for each slice based on the histogram the vug in itself is easy to segment due to the large difference in gray values between the void vug space and the matrix fig 4 and subsequently makes it straightforward to quantify the vug filling the difference between the pre flood and post flood ct stack results in the vug volume change caused by particle deposition and the 3d reconstruction of the difference gives a qualitative description of the spatial deposition of particle with respect to the vug fig 5 b sensitivity analysis and more details about the procedure can be found at khan et al 2019 2 porosity change pre and post flood porosity of each core is measured using an in house multiple energy modified medical computed tomography ct scanner universal systems hd 350e at a resolution of 250 microns the difference in the gray values between the two sets of images gives the change in porosity eq 2 caused by particle deposition during the experiment 2 δ ϕ ct after ct before ct glass ct water 3 permeability change over time three pressure taps inlet middle and outlet are connected to the core and continuously log differential pressure measurements in the top inlet and middle and bottom middle and outlet part of the core the continuous pressure trace is converted to a continuous permeability trace using darcy s law 4 total particle effluent the total effluent volume is collected filtered twice using a 10 μ m filter paper dried and weighed the solid mass in the total effluent gives a measure of the ratio of injected particles deposited in the porous medium a material balance calculation is performed on the total injected particles and porosity change to ratify the total effluent particle collected the experimental workflow setup schematics and detailed procedure is outlined in khan et al 2019 in brief the core is first fabricated with the desired vug configuration and installed in the core hanger fig 6 a pre flood ct scan of the core is acquired in the medical ct scanner at a resolution of 250 μm different concentrations of 25 and 100 μm glass bead suspension are injected in the fabricated core at different fluid flow rates in the top down direction the effluent is collected and the filtered twice to remove and isolate the suspended particles continuous pressure recordings are acquired during the injection phase in the three equidistant pressure transducers to give a continuous permeability trace a post flood ct scan of the fabricated core is acquired combination of this with the pre flood scan results in the porosity reduction and the vug volume change the complete experimental process is outlined in fig 7 2 2 streamline simulation a 2d cmg imex cmg 2015 simulation is set up to understand the change in streamlines caused by the spatial distribution of vugs this simulation is neither modeling the particle deposition process nor measuring the change in the vug volume but it is set up to gain an insight into streamlines taken by the injected particles by solving the darcy s law equation for the vug matrix system the difference between flow in matrix and in vug is not only the domain size but also the dimension flow in matrix can be assumed as 1d but flow in vug is 3d in nature in particular cases it can be simplified to 2d sophisticated models such as the brinkman equation darcy s law in the matrix and stokes equation in the vug are required to model the flow in vug matrix system and would be an appropriate approximation to resolve the flow inside the vug in more detail however it is more computationally involved and we are assessing the first order approximation of the problem nair 2008 jia et al 2013 and more interested in the interactions happening at the vug matrix interface rather than inside the vug both approaches hold the same assumptions on the flow small reynolds number but have different level of detail in the vugs vs matrix the problem is simplified to a quasi 2d system using a cartesian grid 74 131 1 with two cuboidal vugs combined vug volume equal to the single vug volume in khan et al 2019 no grid refining is used the reservoir is saturated with single phase water with pressure greater than the bubble point pressure single phase fluid water is injected from the top end and produced from the bottom end at a constant flow rate of 3280 bbl day upscaled from 60 ml min the flow rate is calculated by keeping the spatial and temporal upscaling ratio the same the vug has a porosity of 99 compared to 41 6 for the matrix while the permeability of the vug is two orders of magnitude greater than the surrounding matrix 200 md since the vug size is one order of magnitude larger than the pore size and the permeability scales as a square with the pore size the vug permeability is chosen to be two order of magnitude larger 20 000 md than the matrix permeability cmg input parameters are presented in table 2 3 results 3 1 vug volume change previous measurements of a single vug khan et al 2019 in porous medium showed that the outer surface of the vug was first filled with particles smoothing the vug surface therefore a large damage was observed in the middle cross section of the vug the maximum damage was observed at the bottom end of the vug for multiple vug configurations the vug volume change due to particle entrapment for each vug at different flow conditions is presented in table 3 vug 1 and vug 2 in the parallel configuration are named arbitrarily as both the vugs are of a similar shape and size and are placed at the same depth inside the core for a steady state system with a uniform influx of particles the two parallel vugs expectedly show a similar loss in vug volume and a similar deposition profile fig 8 for each flow condition upper and lower vug in the series are named according to their spatial locations inside the core a complete or partial 50 fill up of vugs is observed in two instances fig 9 both of them in the series configuration the lower vug in vs4020 is completely filled up while the upper vug in vs6010 is partially filled for the partially filled vug we observe that the sides of the vug in a cross section are filled up and a fluid pathway is present through the center of the vug for the series configuration the spatial location of maximum damage is not the same in the upper and lower vug the upper vug generally has a maximum volume loss in the middle of the vug while the lower vug generally has a maximum loss at the top of the vug this is an interesting observation which tells us about the difference in streamlines and therefore the particle movement observed by each vug the flow carrying the injected particles enters the upper vug from all sides and loses the particles at the vug matrix interface the flow then channels from the upper vug to the lower vug and the particles are deposited at the top part matrix between the two vugs of the lower vug for the parallel configuration the maximum vug volume change is observed in the middle cross section of the vug fig 8 which is inline with the results observed for a single vug this implies that the injected particles and therefore the streamlines are entering the vug from all the sides and not only from the top the middle slice through the spherical vug has the largest perimeter and would therefore have a higher deposition of particles resulting in maximum damage for either vug configuration at 0 5 and 1 total injected particle concentration the higher flowrate has a larger vug volume loss than in the corresponding vug at the lower flowrate and the opposite is observed for the 2 total injected particle concentration where the lower flowrate has a higher vug volume loss 3 2 porosity porosity results calculated across the cross section are presented in fig 10 the first and last scans are ignored as they are prone to boundary errors the porosity change can be defined into three zones i above the top of the upper vug ii top of the upper vug to the bottom of the lower vug and iii below the bottom of the lower vug generally a higher loss in porosity is observed in series configuration than in parallel configuration i e more particles have deposited in the porous medium for the series configuration for series configuration fig 10a the first zone has an average porosity change of 10 and is a function of the total injected particle concentration the lowest concentration has the lowest change while the highest concentration has the middle change a similar behavior is observed in the second zone with the highest porosity reduction observed in the middle of the vugs as evident from the vug volume change as well fig 8 at each concentration the higher flowrate results in more porosity loss the third zone does not depend on the flow rate with the lowest average porosity change of 8 an anomaly is observed for the experiment vs4010 which shows a consistently high porosity drop 16 at all depths for parallel configuration fig 10b the first zone is thicker than the series configuration as the vugs are placed deeper inside the formation it shows a lower porosity loss compared to the series configuration with little variation and shows no dependency on flow conditions this can be explained a larger cross sectional area of the vug in the case of parallel configuration resulting in a higher flow deviation caused by the vugs experiment vp4020 acts as the anomaly with a large porosity loss 10 that increases with depth the second zone shows a higher porosity loss at the top with the porosity loss reducing as we go deeper again no flow dependency is evident in the porosity loss even though the spread is higher compared to the same zone in the series configuration fig 10a porosity loss in the third zone shows a dependency on the flow conditions and depth the highest total injection concentration results in the lowest change in porosity 0 which reduces with depth the middle concentration results in the highest porosity loss 7 which remains uniform with depth while the lowest concentration results in the middle porosity drop 4 which increases with depth an anomaly is observed for the experiment vp4020 where the porosity drop at the near injection face is the highest at 10 and remains higher than any of the others until it crosses the middle of the vugs 3 3 permeability temporal changes in pressure are measured in the top and bottom zones for the series and parallel configuration converted to permeability and normalized with reference to the initial core permeability for each flow case the total solid volume injected is equal to the pore volume of a clean homogeneous core eq 1 resulting in 0 t inj pv si dt 1 normalized permeability for each experiment is plotted against the solid infiltrate pore volume pv si for the top and bottom zones in figs 11 and 12 respectively the top zone permeability is plotted on a logarithmic scale due to the large variations in permeability generally a decrease in permeability over time is observed for all the experiments an initial large drop in permeability is observed in the top zone whereas a delayed permeability drop response is observed in the bottom zone for each individual experiment the top zone permeability drop is larger than the bottom zone permeability drop the top zone permeability versus time in the series configuration is plotted in fig 11a the permeability profile can be divided into two sections i a high gradient with time permeability drop at initial time and ii a gentler constant gradient in the logarithmic scale at later times the point of inflection in the permeability profile is observed at two different time values short duration 0 04 pvsi with 50 permeability loss and long duration 0 1 pvsi with 85 permeability loss the short duration inflection point is present for the 0 5 and 1 injected particle concentration while the long duration inflection point is observed for highest injected particle concentrations 2 0 the same rate of permeability decline is observed for all the short duration cases and experiment vs6020 experiment vs4020 is the anomaly in this case and shows a lower rate of permeability decline the maximum damage by the end of injection i e permeability loss is observed at the highest concentration and highest flow rate the same zones in the parallel configuration yields different permeability profiles fig 11b two general trends are observed i constant gradient decline for the low flow rates 40 ml min and ii an initial high gradient decline followed by a gentler gradient decline for the high flow rate 60 ml min the first trend shows a lower damage by the end of injection up to a maximum of 75 permeability loss for experiment vp4020 with damage increasing with the total injected particle concentration the second trend shows the opposite behavior with generally a higher permeability loss which is inversely related to the total injected particle concentrations the maximum damage 95 permeability loss is observed for the experiment vp6005 a delayed response in the permeability loss in the bottom zone is observed in both the core configurations fig 12 two possibilities for this happening are 1 the larger sized injected particles are initially deposited on the inlet face of the core forming an external filter cake and in the top zone this blocks all the subsequent particles which are large enough to deposit by individually 100 μm glass beads from getting to the bottom zone after a certain thickness of the external filter cake is generated a higher pressure drop is required for the fluid to get inside the matrix this results in shifting of the loosely packed glass beads that form the external filter cake thereby creating wormhole like structures in the external filter cake which allows passage for the fluid and suspended particles inside the porous medium 2 the initial suspension mixture contains the large particles only which cannot get to the bottom zone the subsequent suspension mixture contains a combination of the two particle sizes from which the smaller sized particles get to the bottom zone we believe the first possibility is more likely based on our observation of the suspension mixture having both the particle sizes from the very start and presence of small external filter cake in some experiments the bottom zone permeability versus time in the series configuration is plotted in fig 12a a parabolic decline is observed for all the experiments small differences are observed in the starting point for the 0 5 and 1 total injection concentration which is less than the starting point for the 2 total injection concentration all the experiments result in 40 50 loss in permeability by end of injection the bottom zone versus time for the parallel configuration yields almost no change in permeability for most cases with the highest change being 20 for experiment vp6010 fig 12b this is consistent the low changes in porosity fig 10b observed in the bottom zone a point to note here is that this zone is devoid of the vug unlike the three zones mentioned before top and bottom zone in the series configuration and the top zone in the parallel configuration as evidenced from the initial core porosity profile fig 3 3 4 effluent particulate volume the collected effluent is filtered twice dried and weighed the deposition parameter eq 3 is calculated for each experiment where the total injected particle volume mass for each experiment is the controlling factor and is kept the same 3 deposition m inj m eff m fc m inj 100 where m inj injected particle mass g m eff effluent particle mass g and m fc filter cake mass g the data is plotted in fig 13 for all the experiment cases a general observation can be made about the relative particle deposition in the series and parallel configurations the highest total injected particle concentration 2 results in a higher deposition for the parallel configuration while the other total injected particle concentrations 0 5 and 1 have a higher deposition in the series configuration for the parallel configuration blue colors in fig 13 a direct relation between deposition and total injected particle concentration in observed at constant flowrate an increase in total injected particle concentration results in an increase in particle deposition changing the flowrate only has an impact on deposition at the lowest total injected particle concentration the other concentrations show very little variation the same is not true for the series configuration red colors in fig 13 for a constant flowrate the deposition at the highest and lowest total injected particle concentrations 0 5 and 2 show similar results while the 1 experiments show different values at the lower flowrate more deposition is observed for the experiments with 1 total injected particle concentration compared to the other two concentrations 0 5 and 2 the opposite is observed for the higher flowrate where the 1 total injection concentration has the lowest deposition compared to the other concentrations 3 5 streamline simulation this quasi 2d simulation has been setup to gain an insight into the streamline changes caused by the presence of series parallel vugs reduction in vug permeability and decrease in the vug size this simulation does not model any particulate flow but gives us an indication of how the streamlines change with a change in permeability which are helpful in better understanding the spatial distribution of the particulate deposition streamlines white are generated and plotted over the core blue in series fig 14 and parallel configuration fig 15 the vug with 100 times the core permeability is colored red we find that increasing the permeability greater than a factor of 100 has no significant effect on the streamline deviation as a critical threshold has been achieved and the maximum flow that can be diverted to the vugs has been achieved the initial spatial location of the vug in the series and parallel configuration is shown in figs 14a and 15a respectively at steady state with native reservoir properties each vug occupies 24 of the cross section streamlines at the top of the vug tend to converge and we observe that 43 of the streamlines are redirected towards the upper vug in the series configuration fig 14 this results in a streamline convergence sc factor defined as the number of streamlines entering the vug per unit length of 0 43 0 24 1 78 the sc factors have been calculated for all the scenarios studied in figs 14 and 15 and are shown in table 4 for the series configuration the upper vug always has a higher sc factor compared to the lower vug i e more flow is redirected towards the upper vug in comparison with the lower vug simulating particle entrapment by reducing the vug permeability i e enhancing the permeability contrast between the porous bed and vug reduces the sc factor to 1 67 and 1 56 in the upper and lower vug respectively if the vug size is reduced by one pixel on the sides and three pixels at the bottom 34 volume reduction a sc factor of 1 63 is achieved in both the vugs since the parallel configuration is mirrored along the space in the center of the two vugs equal sc factors should be observed we always observe a higher sc factor in the left vug table 4 which is an error possibly caused by the low density of streamlines plotted therefore for the parallel configuration we will only consider the combined effect of the vugs for the parallel configuration the neighboring vugs compete for flow therefore each simulation scenario results in a lower sc factor compared to the series configuration steady state conditions with native reservoir properties results in a sc factor of 1 61 which reduces to 1 33 and 1 47 for the vug permeability reduction and vug size reduction respectively in summary the vug permeability reduction i e permeability contrast reduction has a more pronounced effect on the parallel configuration 20 change in sc factor compared to 6 and 9 in the upper and lower vug in series configuration while the vug size reduction has the least effect on the lower vug in series configuration 5 change in sc factor 4 discussion we integrate the results for the vug volume change porosity permeability and effluent particulate volume and compare the formation damage between the single vug and dual vugs in series configuration and parallel configuration again the total vug volume for a single vug is the same as the sum of the total vug volume of the two vugs in series and parallel configuration and the geometric center of the single vug and the two dual vug configurations is the same as mentioned above surface deposition is more prominent for smaller sized infiltrate particle size where surface forces such as electrostatic and van der waals forces become significant in this study we have utilized larger sized particles and straining is the prominent mechanism of deposition we start the discussion by highlighting the results obtained for a single vug khan et al 2019 the vug causes injected particles to deposit deeper inside the core maximum particle deposition happens at the extremes of the vug and more particle deposition occurs in the matrix around a vug for the series vug configuration we observe a deeper penetration of injected particles compared to the single vug fig 10a a higher vug volume loss table 3 a maximum vug volume loss at the upstream end of the vug and a larger volume of injected particle retention in the core combined effect in matrix and vug the simulation results show a convergence of streamlines at the inlet of the vug fig 14b with 45 of the streamlines entering 24 of the cross section combining the experimental and simulation results we believe that the main phenomenon by which the greater number of injected particles deposit at the upstream end of the vug in a series configuration is fluid flow focusing in the radial center of the vug prior to entry inside the vug this is primarily due to the permeability contrast between the vug and the matrix this convergence of flow increases the particle particle and particle grain collisions which ultimately results in particles falling out of the fluid flow pathways and depositing in the matrix neat the vug boundary the fluid passes through the vug and diverges at the downstream end and then it exits the vug at this point the lower vug causes the fluid to again converge towards the radial center of the vug prior to entering the lower vug and is potentially why we observe complete or partial fill ups near the downstream end of the upper vug and the upstream end of the lower vug fig 9 we again observe a jump in the vug volume loss at the upstream end of the lower vug the meandering of the streamlines along the depth is also why we observe a deeper deposition of injected particles in the series configuration and a higher volume of particles retained in the core results for the parallel vug configuration are different in comparison with the series configuration we observe a shallower penetration of particles fig 10b a lower vug volume loss and the maximum vug volume is lost at the center cross section of the vug the simulation results again show a convergence of flow at the upstream end of the parallel vugs fig 15b but here the two parallel vugs compete among each other and dilute the effect an individual vug table 4 the fluid flow focusing behavior as observed in the series configuration is reduced here and the flow is not centered towards the radial center of the core most injected particles are not deposited at the upstream end of the vug s and penetrate below the top of the vug with increasing depths up to the center cross section the perimeter of the vug increases and the effect of the other vug is minimized the streamlines converge towards the vug resulting in a larger particle retention in the middle cross section across the vug a similar vug volume loss across all depths is observed in both the vugs in the parallel configuration fig 8 therefore we believe that each vug acts independently as a single vug combining the above results we can deduce that fluid flow focusing is more prominent in the series configuration and results in a higher particle deposition at the upstream end of the vug each vug in parallel acts independently as a separate vug with the separation between the vugs greater than their sphere of influence and therefore does not dictate the deposition of injected particles in the other vug continuing along the same lines if there is no overlap in the spheres of influence of the two parallel vugs each vug will only affect the particles that are within its sphere of influence if the sphere of influence of the two vugs overlap the particle will be affected by both the vugs with the dominance depending on the distance between the particle and the vug at this point we would like to point out that having solid retention profiles at different times would be highly desirable but unfortunately in this setup we only have the pre flood and post flood ct scans and therefore the temporal distribution of the particle concentration breakthrough concentrations vug volume change and porosity change cannot be reconstructed vuggy carbonates have a plethora of vugs which are not arranged in either a series or parallel manner with respect to the flow but are a combination of the two the formation damage effect in carbonates would therefore be a combination of the two as well with the shallower vugs retaining particles and focusing flow for the deeper vugs which in turn would do the same for more deeper vugs parallel vugs at the same depth inside the formation would act as separate vugs and not influence the retention pattern in the other vugs the question that remains is would any connected vug act as a flow focuser regardless of the vug configuration 5 conclusion the evolution of flow patterns due to particle entrapment and its effect of particle deposition in vuggy permeable media have been studied combining the results mentioned above we can conclude that for two vugs of similar shape and volume present in a uniform porous medium i the vugs in series focus the flow and increase the depth of particle deposition and the total volume of particles deposited in the core and ii the vugs in parallel acts independently as separate vugs with their separation greater than their individual sphere of influence and do not dictate the deposition of injected particles fluid flow focusing is an important factor in particle transport and deposition in a vuggy permeable medium and therefore needs to be incorporated in the modeling of particle transport in vuggy porous media to get a realistic picture of particle retention in the permeable medium note all the data generated here can be found at khan et al 2019 credit authorship contribution statement hasan javed khan conceptualization methodology

5992,in contrast to instantaneous concentration of phosphorus in water columns sediments record valuable information on occurrence and sources of phosphorus for a long period associated with human activities and environmental protection however much less attention has been paid to phosphorus in sediments to date the relative contributions of driving factors for tp concentration in sediments has not been elucidated we investigated the occurrence and driving factors for tp in 270 surface sediments of 83 lakes in the catchments of two large rivers yangtze river and huaihe river in china identified the relative contributions of the driving factors and discussed the implication the average tp concentration in the surface sediments of these lakes was 0 82 0 04 mg gdw 1 the average tp concentration in the surface sediments of the urban lakes was larger than that in the rural lakes mitigation measures human activities and lake characteristics contributed 59 0 20 5 and 20 5 to the variation in sediment tp concentration the average tp concentration in the surface sediments significantly decreased with the percentage of annual investment in pollution control to gdp of the cities where the lakes are located for the first time we find mitigation measures have exceeded human activities and lake characteristics to dominate the variation in tp concentration in surface sediments of chinese lakes given the annual investment in pollution control only accounted for 1 14 0 06 of gdp in china from 1991 to 2018 higher percentage would be beneficial to reduce tp concentration in

to mitigate eutrophication in chinese lakes in this study we investigated the occurrence of tp in 270 surface sediments of 83 lakes located at the densely populated and developed catchments of two

jiangxi anhui jiangsu and shanghai the average data of the recent ten years were used for this study the percentage of investment in pollution control to the gdp of china in the period from 2011 to 2016 was collected from national statistics bureau of china the data of the water area catchment area water storage and average depth of these lakes were referenced to the book lakes of china wang and dou 1998 and shown in table s1 the average tp concentration in surface sediments of another 89 lakes in other geographical regions of china europe north america and japan was collected from the

statistical analysis the tp in the surface sediments was analyzed in triplicate the blanks without sediments were prepared with the same methods as the samples the tp concentration in blanks was subtracted the detection limit for tp of this method was 5 µg gdw 1 a reference material of phosphorus in lake sediments gbw07463 was analyzed to confirm the analytical method for tp in the surface

lakes caesar s normalized maximum variance method was used to rotate multiple linear regression mlr was used to calculate the relative contributions of the principal components pcs extracted by pca 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence of tp in the surface sediments the tp concentration in the 270 surface sediments of the 83 lakes varied from 0 36 to 2 18 mg gdw 1 with the mean of 0 82 0 04 mg gdw 1 the average tp concentration in the surface sediments of the 69 lakes at the catchment of yangtze river was 0 87 0 05 mg gdw 1 higher than that of 0 57 0 04 mg gdw 1 of the 14 lakes at the catchment of huaihe river fig 1 the result of cluster analysis indicated that the tp concentration in the surface sediments of the 83 lakes was grouped into four groups fig 2 the 52 lakes in group i had the lowest tp concentration in the surface sediments varying from 0 36 to 0 80 mg gdw 1 the tp in the surface sediments of the 19 lakes in group ii varied from 0 82 to 1 11 mg gdw 1 the tp concentration in the surface sediments of 85 5 out of the 83 lakes was lower than 1 11 mg gdw 1 the tp concentration in the surface sediments of the 12 lakes in groups iii and iv varied from 1 25 to 1 68 mg gdw 1 and from 1 80 to 2 18 mg gdw 1 respectively eleven out of the 12 lakes in groups iii and iv were urban lakes higher tp concentration was found in the surface sediments in the urban lakes at the catchments of both yangtze river and huaihe river the average tp concentration in the surface sediments of the 18 urban lakes was 0 92 0 43 mg gdw 1 larger than 0 80 0 35 mg gdw 1 of the 65 rural lakes table 1 our results were compared with the average tp concentration in the surface sediments of another seven urban lakes and seven rural lakes in other geographical regions of china table 1 both the results of our study and previous studies indicated that the tp concentration in the surface sediments of the urban lakes was higher than that of the rural lakes in china table 1 it may be attributed to the larger discharge of phosphorus in urban areas due to the larger population density caused by the urbanization process in china since economic reform in the 1980s guan et al 2018 the average tp concentration in the surface sediments of the urban lakes at the catchments of yangtze river and huaihe river was lower than those of other urban lakes in other regions of china however the average tp concentration in the surface sediments of the rural lakes at the catchments of yangtze river and huaihe river was larger than those of other rural lakes in other regions of china table 1 this may be ascribed to the fact that the catchments of yangtze river and huaihe river are the most developed region in china the development gap and consequently the gap of the tp discharge in urban areas and rural areas in this region are smaller than other regions in china guan et al 2018 sicular et al 2007 the average tp concentration in the surface sediments of the 83 lakes at the catchments of yangtze river and huaihe river was also compared with those of 89 lakes in other geographical regions in china and in north america europe and japan fig 3 the average tp concentration in the surface sediments of the lakes at the catchments of yangtze river and huaihe river was lower than that of yunnan guizhou plateau in southwestern china 1 34 0 18 mg gdw 1 n 9 which may be ascribed to phosphate rock mining and higher background value of tp in this region liu et al 2004 however the average tp concentration in the surface sediments of the lakes at the catchments of yangtze river and huaihe river was higher than those of inner mongolia xinjiang 0 60 0 11 mg gdw 1 n 5 in northwestern china northeastern northern china 0 58 0 05 mg gdw 1 n 9 and qinghai tibetan plateau in western china 0 41 0 13 mg gdw 1 n 5 fig 3 which may be attributed to the higher population density and more intensive human activities in the catchments of yangtze river and huaihe river guan et al 2018 although speciation of phosphorus and contents of iron and aluminum are important factors for tp concentration in sediments richardson 1985 it is difficult to consider the contributions of these factors to the tp concentration in the surface sediments of these lakes at a large spatial scale because these lakes are receiving different amount of tp discharge the trend of tp concentration in the surface sediments of the lakes in different geographical regions in china was consistent with that in the water columns reported by previous study tong et al 2017 the average tp concentration in the surface sediments of the lakes at the catchments of yangtze river and huaihe river 0 82 0 04 mg gdw 1 n 83 was lower than those in the surface sediments of lakes in north america 1 79 1 00 mg gdw 1 n 15 europe 1 93 1 03 mg gdw 1 n 42 and japan 1 14 0 21 mg gdw 1 n 4 fig 3 it may be ascribed to several reasons firstly the 83 lakes in our study are connected to two large rivers yangtze river and huaihe river and their tributaries the tp in the surface sediments of the 83 lakes may be reduced due to the influences of rivers secondly it may be dependent on the speciation of phosphorus in the surface sediments of these lakes although phosphorus regulations have been implemented in north america japan and europe since the 1970s clenaghan et al 2005 the tp concentration in the surface sediments of the lakes in north america japan and europe may not be reduced due to the speciation of phosphorus thirdly the tp data for the lakes in north america japan and europe was collected from the literature maybe most of the studied lakes in north america japan and europe were eutrophic or heavily polluted 3 2 dominant driving factors for tp in the surface sediments the tp concentration in the surface sediments of the 83 lakes in the catchments of yangtze river and huaihe river was negatively correlated with the industrial pollution control investment fund and daily urban sewage treatment capacity of the catchments but was positively correlated to the annual livestock production per capita crop area population density and phosphate rock reserves of the catchments and the average water depth catchment area and water storage of the lakes table 2 the negative correlations between the tp concentration in the surface sediments and the industrial pollution control investment fund and daily urban sewage treatment capacity in the catchments may be ascribed to the mitigation measures taken in the catchments tong et al 2017 the positive correlations between the tp concentration in the surface sediments and the annual livestock production per capita crop area population density and phosphate rock reserves of the catchments may be attributed to the discharge of phosphorus associated with human activities such as animal husbandry application of chemical fertilizer phosphate rock mining discharge of domestic wastewater bio metabolism of vegetal food and animal meat by human beings liu et al 2004 2016 tong et al 2017 the positive correlations between the tp concentration in the surface sediments and the average water depth catchment area and water storage of the lakes may be attributed to the retention capacity of phosphorus in the lakes which is associated with the average water depth morphology areal water supply annual water inflow rate lake surface area and hydraulic washout coefficient annual water outflow rate lake volume hansson et al 2005 havens 1997 kõiv et al 2011 larsen and mercier 1976 although the study of tong et al 2017 indicated that domestic wastewater was an important source for tp in water columns of chinese lakes no significant correlation was observed between the tp concentration in the surface sediments of the 83 lakes and the discharge of tp from wastewater in this study table 2 this may be attributed to two reasons one reason may be that the tp concentration in the surface sediments of the 83 lakes is probably not proportion to the tp concentration in the water columns the other reason may be that only 83 lakes in the catchments of yangtze river and huaihe river are investigated in this study the nine factors which were significantly correlated to the tp concentration in the surface sediments were analyzed with pca to apportion the dominant driving factors for the variation in the tp concentration in the surface sediments three pcs were extracted by pca and orthogonal rotation by caesar s normalized maximum variance method with eigenvalues 1 and p values 0 05 the cumulative variance accounted for 82 3 of the total variance table 3 for each pc the factors with relatively high loading values 0 7 were marked with bold numbers table 3 pc 1 was responsible for 37 9 of the total variance which was heavily weighted by per capita crop area annual livestock production population density and phosphate rock reserves therefore pc 1 was inferred to indicate the human activities related to the discharge of phosphorus pc 2 accounted for 25 8 of the total variance and was heavily loaded on daily urban sewage treatment capacity and industrial pollution control investment fund therefore pc 2 was inferred to indicate the activities related to mitigation measures pc 3 was responsible for 18 6 of the total variance and was heavily weighted by the average water depth and water storage of the lakes therefore pc 3 was inferred to indicate the lake characteristics mlr was used to calculate the relative contributions of the three pcs for the variation in tp concentration in the surface sediments the mlr equation was expressed as 1 tp 0 763 0 092 pc 1 0 265 pc 2 0 092 pc 3 r 2 0 916 the average contribution of each pc was estimated with the standardized coefficients in eq 1 pc 1 human activities pc 2 mitigation measures and pc 3 lake characteristics contributed 20 5 59 0 and 20 5 to the variation in the tp concentration in the surface sediments of these lakes pc 2 mitigation measures reduced the tp concentration in the surface sediments however pc 1 human activities and pc 3 lake characteristics enhanced the tp concentration in the surface sediments the results suggested that the factors related to mitigation measures daily urban sewage treatment capacity and industrial pollution control investment fund exceeded those related to human activities per capita crop area annual livestock production population density and phosphate rock reserves and lake characteristics the average water depth and water storage of the lakes to dominate the variation in tp concentration in the surface sediments of these lakes 3 3 implications for eutrophication control the average tp concentration in the surface sediments of the lakes was investigated according to the cities where they are located the average tp concentration in the surface sediments of the lakes located in the individual cities significantly decreased with the percentage of the annual investment in pollution control to the gdp of the individual cities fig 4 the average tp concentration in the surface sediments of the lakes in the 15 cities located at the middle reach of yangtze river was 1 02 0 33 mg gdw 1 it was higher than 0 71 0 12 mg gdw 1 of the lakes in the ten cities located at the lower reach of yangtze river but without statistical difference due to the large standard errors and was statistically higher than 0 56 0 12 mg gdw 1 of the lakes in the six cities located at the catchment of huaihe river fig 5 the percentages of annual investment in pollution control to gdp of the cities at the middle and lower reach of yangtze river and the catchment of huaihe river were 0 63 0 09 n 15 0 84 0 17 n 10 and 1 22 0 20 n 6 respectively the trend of the average tp concentration in the surface sediments of the lakes in the cities located at the middle and lower reach of yangtze river and the catchment of huaihe river was inverse to that of the percentage of annual investment in pollution control to gdp the results verified again that mitigation measures were the dominant factor for the tp concentration in the surface sediments of these lakes previous study has suggested that environmental pollution can only be prevented if the percentage of investment in pollution control to gdp is 1 2 guo et al 2015 however the environment can be restored to good status if the percentage of investment in pollution control to gdp ranges from 3 to 5 guo et al 2015 although the annual investment in pollution control of china increased gradually from 62 9 to 953 9 billion chinese yuan during the period from 1991 to 2018 fig 6 the annual investment in pollution control only accounted for 0 60 1 66 of the gdp of china fig 6 with the mean of 1 14 0 06 in the period from 1991 to 2018 which was much lower than that of developed countries such as 5 28 of uk 5 27 of france 6 17 of japan and 3 14 of italia significant decrease in the percentage of investment in pollution control to gdp was even observed since 2010 fig 6 much lower percentage 0 81 0 09 was observed in the 31 densely populated and developed cities located at the catchments of yangtze river and huaihe river although the results of our study indicate that mitigation measures have exceeded human activities and lake characteristics to dominate the variation in tp concentration in the surface sediments of the 83 chinese lakes deterioration of trophic status of these lakes may only be prevented but cannot be restored if the percentage of investment in pollution control to gdp of china is still kept at 1 14 0 06 according to the experience of several developed countries guo et al 2015 higher percentage of the annual investment in pollution control to gdp in these cities and the whole china would be beneficial to reduce tp concentration in lake surface sediments and mitigate eutrophication in chinese lakes much more investment in pollution control would be beneficial for the regions with larger population density per capita crop area annual livestock production and phosphate rock reserves our implication may also be useful for other developing countries with the dual task to develop their economy and protect their environment 4 conclusions the average tp concentration in the surface sediments of the 83 lakes was 0 82 0 04 mg gdw 1 larger than those in most lakes in other regions in china but lower than those in lakes in north america europe and japan the average tp concentration in the surface sediments of the urban lakes n 18 was higher than that of the rural lakes n 65 mitigation measures human activities and lake characteristics contributed 59 0 20 5 and 20 5 to the variation in tp concentration in the surface sediments of the 83 lakes the average tp concentration in the surface sediments of the lakes significantly decreased with the percentage of annual investment in pollution control to gdp of the cities where the lakes are located for the first time we find mitigation measures have exceeded human activities and lake characteristics to dominate the variation in tp concentration in the surface sediments of chinese lakes however the annual investment in pollution control only accounted for 1 14 0 06 in the period from 1991 to 2018 much lower percentage 0 81 0 09 was observed in the 31 densely populated and developed cities located at the catchments of yangtze river and huaihe river higher percentage of the investment in pollution control to gdp in china would be beneficial to reduce tp concentration in lake surface sediments and mitigate

not been elucidated we investigated the occurrence and driving factors for tp in 270 surface sediments of 83 lakes in the catchments of two large rivers yangtze river and huaihe river in china identified the relative contributions of the driving factors and discussed the implication the average tp concentration in the surface sediments of these lakes was 0 82 0 04 mg gdw 1 the average tp concentration in the surface sediments of the urban lakes was larger than that in the rural lakes mitigation measures human activities and lake characteristics contributed 59 0 20 5 and 20 5 to the variation in sediment tp concentration the average tp concentration in the surface sediments significantly decreased with the percentage of annual investment in pollution control to gdp of the cities where the lakes are located for the first time we find mitigation measures have exceeded human activities and lake characteristics to dominate the variation in tp concentration in surface sediments of chinese lakes given the annual investment in pollution control only accounted for 1 14 0 06 of gdp in china from 1991 to 2018 higher percentage would be beneficial to reduce tp concentration in

lakes caesar s normalized maximum variance method was used to rotate multiple linear regression mlr was used to calculate the relative contributions of the principal components pcs extracted by pca 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence of tp in the surface sediments the tp concentration in the 270 surface sediments of the 83 lakes varied from 0 36 to 2 18 mg gdw 1 with the mean of 0 82 0 04 mg gdw 1 the average tp concentration in the surface sediments of the 69 lakes at the catchment of yangtze river was 0 87 0 05 mg gdw 1 higher than that of 0 57 0 04 mg gdw 1 of the 14 lakes at the catchment of huaihe river fig 1 the result of cluster analysis indicated that the tp concentration in the surface sediments of the 83 lakes was grouped into four groups fig 2 the 52 lakes in group i had the lowest tp concentration in the surface sediments varying from 0 36 to 0 80 mg gdw 1 the tp in the surface sediments of the 19 lakes in group ii varied from 0 82 to 1 11 mg gdw 1 the tp concentration in the surface sediments of 85 5 out of the 83 lakes was lower than 1 11 mg gdw 1 the tp concentration in the surface sediments of the 12 lakes in groups iii and iv varied from 1 25 to 1 68 mg gdw 1 and from 1 80 to 2 18 mg gdw 1 respectively eleven out of the 12 lakes in groups iii and iv were urban lakes higher tp concentration was found in the surface sediments in the urban lakes at the catchments of both yangtze river and huaihe river the average tp concentration in the surface sediments of the 18 urban lakes was 0 92 0 43 mg gdw 1 larger than 0 80 0 35 mg gdw 1 of the 65 rural lakes table 1 our results were compared with the average tp concentration in the surface sediments of another seven urban lakes and seven rural lakes in other geographical regions of china table 1 both the results of our study and previous studies indicated that the tp concentration in the surface sediments of the urban lakes was higher than that of the rural lakes in china table 1 it may be attributed to the larger discharge of phosphorus in urban areas due to the larger population density caused by the urbanization process in china since economic reform in the 1980s guan et al 2018 the average tp concentration in the surface sediments of the urban lakes at the catchments of yangtze river and huaihe river was lower than those of other urban lakes in other regions of china however the average tp concentration in the surface sediments of the rural lakes at the catchments of yangtze river and huaihe river was larger than those of other rural lakes in other regions of china table 1 this may be ascribed to the fact that the catchments of yangtze river and huaihe river are the most developed region in china the development gap and consequently the gap of the tp discharge in urban areas and rural areas in this region are smaller than other regions in china guan et al 2018 sicular et al 2007 the average tp concentration in the surface sediments of the 83 lakes at the catchments of yangtze river and huaihe river was also compared with those of 89 lakes in other geographical regions in china and in north america europe and japan fig 3 the average tp concentration in the surface sediments of the lakes at the catchments of yangtze river and huaihe river was lower than that of yunnan guizhou plateau in southwestern china 1 34 0 18 mg gdw 1 n 9 which may be ascribed to phosphate rock mining and higher background value of tp in this region liu et al 2004 however the average tp concentration in the surface sediments of the lakes at the catchments of yangtze river and huaihe river was higher than those of inner mongolia xinjiang 0 60 0 11 mg gdw 1 n 5 in northwestern china northeastern northern china 0 58 0 05 mg gdw 1 n 9 and qinghai tibetan plateau in western china 0 41 0 13 mg gdw 1 n 5 fig 3 which may be attributed to the higher population density and more intensive human activities in the catchments of yangtze river and huaihe river guan et al 2018 although speciation of phosphorus and contents of iron and aluminum are important factors for tp concentration in sediments richardson 1985 it is difficult to consider the contributions of these factors to the tp concentration in the surface sediments of these lakes at a large spatial scale because these lakes are receiving different amount of tp discharge the trend of tp concentration in the surface sediments of the lakes in different geographical regions in china was consistent with that in the water columns reported by previous study tong et al 2017 the average tp concentration in the surface sediments of the lakes at the catchments of yangtze river and huaihe river 0 82 0 04 mg gdw 1 n 83 was lower than those in the surface sediments of lakes in north america 1 79 1 00 mg gdw 1 n 15 europe 1 93 1 03 mg gdw 1 n 42 and japan 1 14 0 21 mg gdw 1 n 4 fig 3 it may be ascribed to several reasons firstly the 83 lakes in our study are connected to two large rivers yangtze river and huaihe river and their tributaries the tp in the surface sediments of the 83 lakes may be reduced due to the influences of rivers secondly it may be dependent on the speciation of phosphorus in the surface sediments of these lakes although phosphorus regulations have been implemented in north america japan and europe since the 1970s clenaghan et al 2005 the tp concentration in the surface sediments of the lakes in north america japan and europe may not be reduced due to the speciation of phosphorus thirdly the tp data for the lakes in north america japan and europe was collected from the literature maybe most of the studied lakes in north america japan and europe were eutrophic or heavily polluted 3 2 dominant driving factors for tp in the surface sediments the tp concentration in the surface sediments of the 83 lakes in the catchments of yangtze river and huaihe river was negatively correlated with the industrial pollution control investment fund and daily urban sewage treatment capacity of the catchments but was positively correlated to the annual livestock production per capita crop area population density and phosphate rock reserves of the catchments and the average water depth catchment area and water storage of the lakes table 2 the negative correlations between the tp concentration in the surface sediments and the industrial pollution control investment fund and daily urban sewage treatment capacity in the catchments may be ascribed to the mitigation measures taken in the catchments tong et al 2017 the positive correlations between the tp concentration in the surface sediments and the annual livestock production per capita crop area population density and phosphate rock reserves of the catchments may be attributed to the discharge of phosphorus associated with human activities such as animal husbandry application of chemical fertilizer phosphate rock mining discharge of domestic wastewater bio metabolism of vegetal food and animal meat by human beings liu et al 2004 2016 tong et al 2017 the positive correlations between the tp concentration in the surface sediments and the average water depth catchment area and water storage of the lakes may be attributed to the retention capacity of phosphorus in the lakes which is associated with the average water depth morphology areal water supply annual water inflow rate lake surface area and hydraulic washout coefficient annual water outflow rate lake volume hansson et al 2005 havens 1997 kõiv et al 2011 larsen and mercier 1976 although the study of tong et al 2017 indicated that domestic wastewater was an important source for tp in water columns of chinese lakes no significant correlation was observed between the tp concentration in the surface sediments of the 83 lakes and the discharge of tp from wastewater in this study table 2 this may be attributed to two reasons one reason may be that the tp concentration in the surface sediments of the 83 lakes is probably not proportion to the tp concentration in the water columns the other reason may be that only 83 lakes in the catchments of yangtze river and huaihe river are investigated in this study the nine factors which were significantly correlated to the tp concentration in the surface sediments were analyzed with pca to apportion the dominant driving factors for the variation in the tp concentration in the surface sediments three pcs were extracted by pca and orthogonal rotation by caesar s normalized maximum variance method with eigenvalues 1 and p values 0 05 the cumulative variance accounted for 82 3 of the total variance table 3 for each pc the factors with relatively high loading values 0 7 were marked with bold numbers table 3 pc 1 was responsible for 37 9 of the total variance which was heavily weighted by per capita crop area annual livestock production population density and phosphate rock reserves therefore pc 1 was inferred to indicate the human activities related to the discharge of phosphorus pc 2 accounted for 25 8 of the total variance and was heavily loaded on daily urban sewage treatment capacity and industrial pollution control investment fund therefore pc 2 was inferred to indicate the activities related to mitigation measures pc 3 was responsible for 18 6 of the total variance and was heavily weighted by the average water depth and water storage of the lakes therefore pc 3 was inferred to indicate the lake characteristics mlr was used to calculate the relative contributions of the three pcs for the variation in tp concentration in the surface sediments the mlr equation was expressed as 1 tp 0 763 0 092 pc 1 0 265 pc 2 0 092 pc 3 r 2 0 916 the average contribution of each pc was estimated with the standardized coefficients in eq 1 pc 1 human activities pc 2 mitigation measures and pc 3 lake characteristics contributed 20 5 59 0 and 20 5 to the variation in the tp concentration in the surface sediments of these lakes pc 2 mitigation measures reduced the tp concentration in the surface sediments however pc 1 human activities and pc 3 lake characteristics enhanced the tp concentration in the surface sediments the results suggested that the factors related to mitigation measures daily urban sewage treatment capacity and industrial pollution control investment fund exceeded those related to human activities per capita crop area annual livestock production population density and phosphate rock reserves and lake characteristics the average water depth and water storage of the lakes to dominate the variation in tp concentration in the surface sediments of these lakes 3 3 implications for eutrophication control the average tp concentration in the surface sediments of the lakes was investigated according to the cities where they are located the average tp concentration in the surface sediments of the lakes located in the individual cities significantly decreased with the percentage of the annual investment in pollution control to the gdp of the individual cities fig 4 the average tp concentration in the surface sediments of the lakes in the 15 cities located at the middle reach of yangtze river was 1 02 0 33 mg gdw 1 it was higher than 0 71 0 12 mg gdw 1 of the lakes in the ten cities located at the lower reach of yangtze river but without statistical difference due to the large standard errors and was statistically higher than 0 56 0 12 mg gdw 1 of the lakes in the six cities located at the catchment of huaihe river fig 5 the percentages of annual investment in pollution control to gdp of the cities at the middle and lower reach of yangtze river and the catchment of huaihe river were 0 63 0 09 n 15 0 84 0 17 n 10 and 1 22 0 20 n 6 respectively the trend of the average tp concentration in the surface sediments of the lakes in the cities located at the middle and lower reach of yangtze river and the catchment of huaihe river was inverse to that of the percentage of annual investment in pollution control to gdp the results verified again that mitigation measures were the dominant factor for the tp concentration in the surface sediments of these lakes previous study has suggested that environmental pollution can only be prevented if the percentage of investment in pollution control to gdp is 1 2 guo et al 2015 however the environment can be restored to good status if the percentage of investment in pollution control to gdp ranges from 3 to 5 guo et al 2015 although the annual investment in pollution control of china increased gradually from 62 9 to 953 9 billion chinese yuan during the period from 1991 to 2018 fig 6 the annual investment in pollution control only accounted for 0 60 1 66 of the gdp of china fig 6 with the mean of 1 14 0 06 in the period from 1991 to 2018 which was much lower than that of developed countries such as 5 28 of uk 5 27 of france 6 17 of japan and 3 14 of italia significant decrease in the percentage of investment in pollution control to gdp was even observed since 2010 fig 6 much lower percentage 0 81 0 09 was observed in the 31 densely populated and developed cities located at the catchments of yangtze river and huaihe river although the results of our study indicate that mitigation measures have exceeded human activities and lake characteristics to dominate the variation in tp concentration in the surface sediments of the 83 chinese lakes deterioration of trophic status of these lakes may only be prevented but cannot be restored if the percentage of investment in pollution control to gdp of china is still kept at 1 14 0 06 according to the experience of several developed countries guo et al 2015 higher percentage of the annual investment in pollution control to gdp in these cities and the whole china would be beneficial to reduce tp concentration in lake surface sediments and mitigate eutrophication in chinese lakes much more investment in pollution control would be beneficial for the regions with larger population density per capita crop area annual livestock production and phosphate rock reserves our implication may also be useful for other developing countries with the dual task to develop their economy and protect their environment 4 conclusions the average tp concentration in the surface sediments of the 83 lakes was 0 82 0 04 mg gdw 1 larger than those in most lakes in other regions in china but lower than those in lakes in north america europe and japan the average tp concentration in the surface sediments of the urban lakes n 18 was higher than that of the rural lakes n 65 mitigation measures human activities and lake characteristics contributed 59 0 20 5 and 20 5 to the variation in tp concentration in the surface sediments of the 83 lakes the average tp concentration in the surface sediments of the lakes significantly decreased with the percentage of annual investment in pollution control to gdp of the cities where the lakes are located for the first time we find mitigation measures have exceeded human activities and lake characteristics to dominate the variation in tp concentration in the surface sediments of chinese lakes however the annual investment in pollution control only accounted for 1 14 0 06 in the period from 1991 to 2018 much lower percentage 0 81 0 09 was observed in the 31 densely populated and developed cities located at the catchments of yangtze river and huaihe river higher percentage of the investment in pollution control to gdp in china would be beneficial to reduce tp concentration in lake surface sediments and mitigate

5993,southwest china receives abundant rainfall with a mean annual precipitation of 1450 mm 1960 2013 but surface runoff is small whereas subsurface runoff is relatively large on karst hillslopes however not enough studies have been done to investigate the mechanisms of surface and subsurface runoff generation in subtropical karst landscapes here we report the dynamics of soil water content swc instantaneous water levels at the soil epikarst interface sei and runoff characteristics related to the mechanisms of near surface runoff generation at the slope scale 5 m 20 m four field rainfall simulation experiments were conducted with rainfall intensities ranging from 35 to 136 mm h 1 subsurface saturation started first at the relatively flat lower slope and then extended up slope subsurface runoff began after subsurface saturated areas connected to each other representing a fill and spill mechanism surface runoff which mainly developed after instantaneous water levels reached near the surface represents an infiltration excess and saturation excess runoff mechanism where two thresholds must be attained rainfall amount and intensity the rainfall amount threshold is dependent on soil water deficit water capacity of the epikarst surface depression at the sei and deep percolation from sei the rainfall intensity threshold must be larger than the steady infiltration rate of sei which is the prerequisite for the saturation of the epikarst surface depression and soil layer steady sei infiltration rate was estimated 40 mm h 1 according to the surface runoff generation mechanism this parameter is important as it represents the lower boundary condition in modeling hillslope hydrological processes rainfall runoff thresholds for surface and subsurface runoff decrease with increasing rainfall intensity overall our results show that epikarst permeability along karst hillslopes is relatively high being the main factor controlling surface and subsurface runoff generation therefore epikarst permeability significantly affects near surface hydrological processes in karst landscapes our data contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of runoff generation processes and water cycle in the critical zone keywords runoff mechanism conceptual hydrological model subsurface runoff soil epikarst systems karst critical zone 1 introduction karst landscapes cover approximately 7 12 of the earth s continental area and about one quarter of the global population is completely or partially dependent on drinking water from karst aquifers hartmann et al 2014 the karst region of southwest china is one of the world s largest areas exposed to subtropical climates with a nearly continuous karst terrain covering a total area of 5 4 10 5 km2 fu et al 2015c cockpit karst is the most typical landscape style present in southwest china and is locally known as fengcong which is characterized by enclosed depressions of similar size surrounded by overlapping hills and ridges the regional bedrock geology is primarily composed of dolomitic carbonatites limestone and intermediate types these rocks have a dense structure low porosity 3 and low hydrochloric acid hcl insoluble matter 4 yuan 1994 previous studies on karst slope hydrological processes were conducted in either sub humid semi arid or mediterranean karst areas wilcox et al 2008 leh et al 2008 li et al 2011 the results from these studies cannot represent humid subtropical karst near surface hydrological regimes fu et al 2015d this region is characterized by fragile ecosystems controlled by geological carbonate bedrock and hydroclimatic rainfall and temperature pattern conditions as well as anthropogenic activities thus the region is subject to severe soil erosion and karst rocky desertification refers to the processes and human activities that transform a karst area covered by vegetation and soil into a rocky landscape which has had tremendous negative impacts to the environment and social and economic conditions at local and regional scales jiang et al 2014 the region is also subject to natural hazards such as frequent floods and droughts an analysis from liu et al 2014 revealed significantly enhanced precipitation extremes and flood severity across southwestern china over the past 60 years therefore knowledge of the mechanisms that generate hillslope runoff in this region is fundamental to combat rocky desertification effectively manage water resources and forecast flood disasters fleury et al 2013 hillslopes are a fundamental landscape unit for hydrological responses and also serve as a basic building block for many watershed models tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006b hillslope hydrology research can provide parameters for and can help to design the structure of watershed models integration of the hillslope structures into earth system models esms can improve esm grid level water energy and biogeochemical fluxes prediction ability fan et al 2019 moreover despite the importance of the integrated soil epikarst systems for karst water resources previous research mostly focused on karst groundwater only a few studies that directly characterized the shallow subsurface processes of karst systems have been conducted berthelin and hartmann 2020 in the karst region of southwest china slopes are characterized by a thin soil layer that overlays a highly weathered bedrock surface epikarst which is formed by soil filled grikes this is similar to other landforms where irregular bedrock surface underlays a shallow soil layer tromp van and mcdonnell 2006a graham et al 2010 this region experiences a high mean annual precipitation 1450 mm but the surface runoff sr coefficient on karst hillslopes consistently remains less than 5 regardless of the amount of annual rainfall chen et al 2012 peng and wang 2012 qin et al 2015 we found that deep percolation and subsurface runoff ssr are the dominant runoff components accounting for 71 and 9 of the total rainfall amount respectively zhu et al 2017 in contrast sr occupies less than 2 on karst hillslopes in southwest china in the rainy season from july 30th to september 30th 2015 zhu et al 2017 therefore the area s hydrological processes mainly occur at the subsurface level previous studies have shown that ssr is a dominant runoff producing mechanism in humid environments and steep terrain around the world weiler et al 2005 mcdonnell 2003 tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006b although wilcox et al 2008 and fu et al 2015a c conducted valuable research on subsurface runoff along karst hillslopes sr or ssr on certain karst hillslope plots have seldom been monitored through long term natural rainfall runoff observations zhu et al 2017 thus the mechanisms of sr and ssr generation on karst hillslopes merit further research this common response among various catchments may be empirically more meaningful than the particular characteristics of an experimental watershed mcdonnell 2003 infiltrated water the process by which water enters the soil pore spaces and becomes soil water that moves laterally down a hillslope through soil layers or on the soil bedrock interface sbi produces lateral subsurface runoff which contributes to a stream weiler et al 2005 studies in the early 1990s indicated that pre event water stored in a watershed before a rainfall event is the largest contributor approximately 75 worldwide to runoff in a stream furthermore vertical and lateral preferential flows are common in natural soils particularly in steep terrain buttle 2005 a transient water table is rapidly generated at the sbi after the onset of a precipitation event where this response controls the initial stage of lateral subsurface runoff due to the combined impact of three factors i an increase in the hydraulic gradient ii an increase in the cross sectional flow area and iii the formation of transient saturation areas across the hillslope weiler et al 2005 thus tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006b proposed the fill and spill theory to understand the development of ssr and explain the observed threshold behavior of the panola hillslope du et al 2016 found that low angle slopes exhibit thresholds and a fill and spill behavior similar to steeper hillslopes in previous studies we discovered that ssr is an important mechanism that generates runoff through field rainfall simulation experiments in sub tropical cockpit karst landscapes fu et al 2015c d ssr also fluctuates considerably with the permeability and topography of the soil epikarst interface sei initial soil moisture and rainfall intensity fu et al 2015d we also demonstrated the influence that the soil epikarst architecture has on near surface hydrological processes on karst hillslopes fu et al 2015c however our previous studies were mainly focused on runoff hydrographs in other words our observations of sr and ssr generation mechanisms were limited due to a lack of essential monitoring equipments fu et al 2015c d such as soil moisture or instantaneous water table monitors in this study we aim to determine whether our previous observations justify the fill and spill theory fu et al 2015d found that sr develops only under extremely high rainfall events and revealed that karst hillslopes produce sr from a saturation excess runoff mechanism however most karst slopes are characterized by a thin soil layer that overlays an epikarst surface e g a soil depth of merely 10 30 cm on the hillslope fu et al 2015b in this case the soil layer becomes easily saturated which should easily generate significant sr however in reality the sr coefficient consistently remains below 5 during natural rainfall events chen et al 2012 thus no sr occurs during relatively small rainfall intensities such as those in sprinkling experiments fu et al 2015c d therefore the saturation excess runoff mechanism is not fully applicable to karst slope sr gan et al 2016 also found that sr does not occur under a relatively small rainfall intensity on bare karst slopes once the rainfall intensity is large enough however the sr amount increases with an increase in the rainfall intensity therefore numerous studies have suggested the existence of a rainfall amount threshold that at a certain point generates runoff mcdonnell 2003 tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006b tromp van and mcdonnell 2006a graham et al 2010 fu et al 2015d we however propose that there is another rainfall intensity threshold that produces sr moreover chen et al 2012 found that the local substrate structure rather than land use affects sr generation yang et al 2016 several other studies have also shown that the permeability of the sbi has a significant impact on hydrological processes at the hillslope scale freer et al 2002 weiler et al 2005 tromp van and mcdonnell 2006a graham et al 2010 fu et al 2015d based on virtual numerical experiments ameli et al 2015 suggested that the physical mechanisms associated with ssr which derive from infiltration excess at the sbi are similar to sr due to infiltration excess at the soil surface both occur on slopes characterized by a highly permeable layer with high infiltration capabilities that overlies parallel a low permeability layer e g bedrock for sr the air layer serves as the high permeability layer and the soil layer as the low permeable layer thus the prerequisite for ssr generation is infiltration water perched at the sbi i e the soil infiltration rate must exceed the sbi infiltration rate karst slope soils have a high infiltration capacity with steady infiltration rates ranging from 40 to 130 mm h 1 chen et al 2011 allowing the infiltrated water to easily reach the sei which then acts as an infiltration barrier for the accumulation of water fu et al 2015d thus we hypothesize that the rainfall intensity threshold to yield runoff is related to the permeability of the sei on the karst slope fu et al 2015d found that the sei has a near steady infiltration rate of approximately 35 mm h 1 due to the sufficiently large soil infiltration rate in karst regions the rainfall intensity should be extremely high larger than the sei infiltration rate for formation of transient saturation area through which the subsurface saturation area can form and expand which ultimately leads to ssr and sr based on these previous results we propose a hypothesis where a rainfall intensity threshold exists in addition to the rainfall amount threshold to generate both ssr and sr moreover the rainfall intensity threshold is related to the sei infiltration rate then the following questions guided this study 1 does the fill and spill theory apply to the ssr generation mechanism on karst hillslopes 2 does a rainfall intensity threshold exist that will generate significant ssr and sr if so is there a relationship between this value and the steady sei infiltration rate 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description this study was conducted in a typical karst catchment 24 43 58 9 24 44 48 8 n 108 18 56 9 108 19 58 4 e in huanjiang county which lies in northwest guangxi southwest china the topographic catchment has an area of 1 46 km2 fig 1a and 2 b and andthe elevation ranges from 272 to 647 m 647 m above sea level the watershed is representative of cockpit karst and characterized by a flat depression 30 of the watershed surrounded by hills on three sides with an outlet in the northeast fig 1a approximately 60 of the hillslope land has a slope greater than 25 the near surface karst slope soil epikarst architecture system consists of a thin soil layer 0 50 cm 0 50 cm underlain by a highly irregular epikarst surface shallow and discontinuous soils derive from dolomite which account for about one third in karst region of southwest china and contain significant amounts of rock fragments the soil type is rendzina which has a texture between clay and clay loam 25 50 25 50 silt and 30 60 30 60 clay soils are well drained gravelly and calcareous with stable infiltration rates ranging from 40 to 130 mm h 1 chen et al 2012 the epikarst surface has a near steady infiltration rate of approximately 35 mm h 1 where the subsurface runoff occurs along the sei and is dominated by preferential flow fu et al 2015d the region has a subtropical mountainous monsoon climate with an average annual temperature and rainfall of 19 9 c and 1 455 6 mm 1980 2013 respectively approximately 74 of a given year s precipitation falls during the wet season between may and september our previous study hu et al 2015 reports more detailed information on the geohydrological conditions of this region 2 2 experimental plots the hillslope used in this study is located on the western side of the watershed figs 1 and 2 the general approach to studying subsurface runoff generation and movement in response to precipitation and snowmelt involves excavation to the sbi at the lower boundary of the experimental hillslope to expose the subsurface runoff tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006b fu et al 2015d twelve hillslope runoff plots 5 m 20 m were established at the lower part of the slope fig 2b each with a trench of 5 m in width the total width of the trench was 80 m where material was removed completely down to the unweathered bedrock an average vertical depth of 4 m using a backhoe the trench site epikarst was moderately weathered with a shallow soil mantle the mean soil thickness of the 12 plots was 50 cm based on a survey of the trenches among the 12 runoff plots concrete walls were installed deep into the epikarst surface on three sides of the plots the left right and upper edges to prevent sr exchange between adjacent plots the 12 plots were divided into four groups corn forage walnut and natural grassland with three replicates to quantify the effects that vegetation types on water sediments and nutrient loss a grassland plot figs 1b and 2 which experienced very little sr and ssr was selected for rainfall simulation experiments in this study to discern water pathway characteristics the grassland plot soil depth was surveyed on a 1 m grid using a 10 0 mm hand auger that was vertically forced through the soil profile to the epikarst the soil depths of the study plot range from 0 to 1 18 m with a mean value of 0 66 m and coefficient of variation of 0 60 the surface topography is planar apart from a bedrock outcrop at the lower left corner of the plot fig 2 whereas the bedrock topography is highly irregular there are some areas of deep soils of the plot between 4 14 m upslope from the trench fig 3 which are caused by large depression in the epikarst these areas of deep soils are defined as epikarst surface depression our previous study fu et al 2015d provide detailed descriptions of the trench characteristics nine soil samples were collected from up middle and down slope positions in replicates of three to measure the soil properties soil particle size distributions were measured using a mastersizer 2000 malvern instruments malvern england the soil bulk density of undisturbed soil samples bd g cm 3 was measured using steel columns 5 cm diameter 100 cm 3 volume via the excavation method the rock fragment content rfc was determined as the ratio between the rock weight and dry soil weight soil saturated hydraulic conductivity mm h 1 was measured using the constant head method while soil organic carbon soc g kg 1 was determined using the dichromate oxidation method fu et al 2015d table 1 lists the soil and epikarst characteristics 2 3 rainfall simulations and data collection four portable rainfall simulators were used to simulate rainfall with approximately 80 uniformity the structure of the portable rainfall simulators is described in detail by fu et al 2015d four rainfall simulation experiments were conducted between october 28 and november 4 2016 to understand rainfall infiltration runoff processes rainfall intensity r i was set to 35 73 100 and 136 mm h 1 to simulate medium to high intensity rainstorms in the region fu et al 2015d to conduct the experiments under uniform initial soil water conditions the plot was sprinkled with 200 mm of water once daily prior to each experiment all four rainfall simulation experiments consumed 200 mm of water and near steady runoff rates were reached at the end of the experiments table 2 lists the rainfall and runoff characteristics eight observation points were selected to monitor the soil water content swc at 10 cm 30 cm and the sei based on the soil depth distribution six of the eight locations were monitored for the instantaneous water table at the sei fig 3 shows the locations for swc and water level monitoring the swc was measured every 5 min using frequency domain decomposition stevens hydra probe soil sensor stevens usa water tables at the sei were monitored every 5 min using the water level logger u20 001 04 onset america the 5 m trench was divided into five equal sections and the ssr from each section was measured and recorded as subsurface runoff 1 ssf1 5 ssf5 from left to right a water pipe was fixed at the middle of the trench to collect sr another pipe was installed at the bottom of the trench face to measure epikarst seepage runoff esr which occurred at the epikarst bedrock interface ebi sr ssr and esr were measured by routing the runoff through a tipping bucket flow gauge with a resolution of 100 ml ssr and 1 l sr and esr tb1l hydrological services usa the lower edges of the experiment plot were covered in plastic film to prevent rainfall from dripping directly into the sr gutter fig 2c 3 results 3 1 temporal and spatial variations in swc patterns table 3 lists the initial swc at different positions and depths in the four experiments all swcs increased with soil depth among the three slope positions the initial swcs among the four experiments were compared and analyzed with a one way analysis of variance one way anova which indicated that there were no statistical differences among the four experiments p 0 01 thus the differences in hydrological processes among the four rainfall simulation experiments are attributable to different rainfall intensities rainfall intensity significantly affected variations in the swc table 4 lists the swc response times showing that it decreased with rainfall intensity at three depths and different locations with significant differences at certain locations the slope position influenced the swc response times at the sei table 5 from the down slope to middle slope and finally to the upper slope these differences were not significant at the highest rainfall intensity 136 mm h 1 figs 4a c and 5a c respectively show the swc characteristics for rainfall intensity at 35 and 100 mm h 1 at different depths and slope positions the swc changed rapidly i e rapid increase during the onset of precipitation and rapid decline quickly after the rain had stopped at which point they returned to the original levels prior to precipitation within 24 h these observations indicate a low soil water storage capacity and rapid hydrological processes on karst hillslopes in the sei the swc was sustained longer than at the top soil layers and significantly longer at middle and down slope areas compared with the up slope area this may be attributed to the lateral movement of infiltrated water and finer soil textures at deeper soil layers which are characterized by higher water holding capacities at greater depths below the surface 3 2 water levels at the soil epikarst interface the transient water levels at the sei represented the temporal and spatial patterns of transient saturation at the sei while the water levels wls at the sei relate to ssr initiation and generation at the trench face tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006b fig 3 similar to the swc the wl response times decreased with rainfall intensity table 6 indicating that the subsurface saturation areas formed rapidly under high rainfall intensity the wl response times had the following orders w6 88 cm w5 120 cm w8 141 cm w2 138 cm w4 145 cm and w3 139 cm fig 3 subsurface saturation areas were generated from the down slope to upper slope response time w6 responded first because it had the shallowest depth 88 cm the wls began to decline after rainfall had stopped and disappeared within 18 h fig 5d the disappearing times had the following order w3 w4 w6 w5 w8 and w2 the subsurface saturation areas vanished from the upper slope to down slope 3 3 surface and subsurface runoff hydrographs fig 6 a shows the time for runoff to occur sr ssr and esr plotted against the rainfall intensity for different treatments a negative exponential function was used to fit the curves zhao et al 2014 both regression equations passed the test of significance p 0 05 indicating that they precisely capture the negative relationship between these two parameters in other words the time to runoff decreases with rainfall intensity the relationship between the time to peak discharge ssr sr and esr and rainfall intensity is similar to the relationship between time to runoff and rainfall intensity which can also be described using the negative exponential function fig 6b runoff coefficients r c of sr increased with rainfall intensity r i r c 0 203 r i 8 377 r 2 0 998 p 0 05 f 447 9 these observations suggest that more rainfall was converted to sr under high rainfall intensity the increase in sr with increasing rainfall intensity was concordant with previous observations chaplot and bissonnais 2003 zhao et al 2014 figs 4e f and 5e f show runoff hydrographs for relatively low 35 mm h 1 and high 100 mm h 1 levels of rainfall intensity respectively consisting of sr ssr and esr ssr and esr dominated runoff processes under low rainfall intensity sr was not observed in the lowest rainfall intensity event 35 mm h 1 but did occur with increasing amounts as rainfall intensity increased table 2 figs 4 and 5 sr occurred later than ssr in all rainfall events table 2 rainfall intensity exerted a significant effect on the hydrograph shapes of sr ssr and esr figs 4f and 5f the hydrograph was flat for lower rainfall intensity but fairly steep for high rainfall intensity the peak ssr rates were 2 2 6 8 6 1 and 14 5 mm h 1 while the esr rates were 1 9 3 6 3 5 and 5 0 mm h 1 with rainfall intensities of 35 73 100 and 136 mm h 1 respectively the individual ssr characteristics were similar to those of the total ssr as discussed above table 7 summarizes the negative relationship between time to runoff and time to peak runoff for each individual ssr and rainfall intensity which can also be described using a negative exponential function both time to runoff and time to peak runoff followed a similar order regardless of rainfall intensity i e ssf5 ssf4 ssf3 and ssf1 4 discussion 4 1 variations in the swc and water table at the sei the soil water content at a depth of 10 cm was less than that at 30 cm and the sei which can be attributed to differences in the soil texture and saturated hydraulic conductivity between the soil at 10 cm and that at 30 cm and the sei as summarized in table 1 the soil sand contents were identical at 10 28 1 and 30 cm 28 1 but the soils at 30 cm had increased clay contents with an average of 36 2 compared with the clay content at 10 cm that had an average of 28 3 moreover the soils at 10 cm had a greater saturated hydraulic conductivity with an average of 174 2 mm h 1 compared with that at 30 cm with an average of 42 0 mm h 1 finally the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the sei was the lowest 16 0 mm h 1 compared with the soils at 10 and 30 cm therefore the infiltration water perched at the sei while lateral subsurface runoff contributed to the delay in soil water depletion at the sei all of these reasons caused the soil water content at 10 cm to be less than that at 30 cm and the sei swc response times showed a positive correlation with rainfall intensity indicating that the infiltration rate increased with rainfall intensity in our experiments however the effect that rainfall intensity had on the infiltration rate was inconsistent on certain soils surface seals decreased the infiltration rates with increases in the rainfall intensity dunne et al 1991 nevertheless a larger soil infiltration capacity than the rainfall intensity was maintained during most rainfall events due to the higher mean soil saturated hydraulic conductivity 54 9 cm h 1 in the karst area of our experiment site compared with non karst areas 2 55 cm h 1 for loess soil and 0 03 cm h 1 for glacial till soil wang et al 2016 thus the swc response times decreased with rainfall intensity the upslope region in the study area is steeper than the down slope region therefore infiltration water moved laterally from the up slope to the down slope where the swc at the sei first changed at the down slope and subsequently at the up slope the swc and transient water level at the sei rapidly changed throughout our experiments figs 4a c and 5 the thin soil layer relatively high hydraulic conductivity and presence of several fissures gaps channels and sinkholes lead to a poor water holding capacity and rapid hydrological processes in the karst area although the region has a subtropical mountainous monsoon climate with a large amount of annual precipitation more than 1 200 mm the karst terrain lacks sufficient soil water for vegetation growth fu et al 2015 wang et al 2016 2017 this unique drought phenomenon which is not induced by climatic but rather geological conditions is defined as karst drought chen and wang 2004 we note that all experiments were conducted in november 2016 during which rapid hydrological processes resulted in fairly similar initial swcs at different layers and slope positions table 3 providing further evidence that the soil has a low water retention capacity 4 2 subsurface runoff generation mechanism ssr is the primary runoff components in humid environments with steep terrain weiler et al 2005 fu et al 2015c d tables 5 and 6 list the response time of the swc and water tables respectively at the sei previous studies have shown that the development of the lateral transient water level at the sei controls the onset of lateral ssr due to the combined effect of several factors an increase in hydraulic gradient increase in the cross sectional flow area and the accumulation of subsurface saturation areas across the sei weiler et al 2005 tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006b based on our observations of the transient subsurface water tables when exposed to rainfall intensities of 100 mm h 1 fig 3 and table 6 we found that the subsurface saturation area first formed at the down slope and then expanded upward when the subsurface saturation area at the middle and down slopes connected with each other 29 min after the onset of rainfall this instantaneously generated an individual ssr ssf4 and ssf5 all observed individual ssr began 39 min after the subsurface saturation area expanded to the up slope the time to peak ssr occurred 69 min after the onset of rainfall suggesting that all subsurface saturation areas were connected across the entire slope at that time the expansion of the subsurface saturation area from the down slope to the up slope is inconsistent with the conclusion of tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006b who observed the opposite this can be explained where the down slope is gentler than the up slope in our study area which allowed infiltrated water at the down slope to perch at the sei expanding the saturation area up slope tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006b obtained a contrary result because the up slope was gentler than the down slope the relative gradient position of the slope controls the direction in which the saturation area expands the observed development of ssr agrees with the fill and spill theory proposed by tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006b infiltration water perches at the depression area of sei after which water tables reach the edge of the depression filling process and spill downslope over the epikarst surface towards the trench face spilling process as ssr continues until the disparate subsurface saturation areas accumulate into one area the rapid increase in the runoff rate figs 4d and 5d indicates that spilling processes were triggered immediately after most epikarst surface depressions filled the sharp decrease in the flow rate suggests that spilling processes ceased when rainfall ceased figs 4d and 5d thus the fill and spill theory reflects the mechanism that generates ssr and corresponding threshold phenomenon on karst hillslopes in this area our calculated ssr coefficients were quite small even when rainfall intensity was high table 2 particularly in comparison with the results of fu et al 2015d this is due to the fact that we observed significant ssr discharge from the adjoining runoff plots during the experiments which had not been counted inducing the low total runoff coefficients accordingly the concrete walls did not affect the downslope movement of ssr proving that the underground hydrological connectivity of the plots was not affected by the facility this can be attributed to an inherent characteristic of karst slopes i e the abundance of fissures conduits caves and sinkholes qin et al 2015 suggesting that the concrete walls were unable to restrict ssr however no concrete walls were installed in the study plot analyzed in fu et al 2015d furthermore fu et al 2015d monitored ssr at a trench face with a width greater than 7 m which encompassed the entire ssr direct observation of subsurface saturation area expansion is difficult therefore a secondary technique is required to validate the fill and spill behavior in our study area a potential method is the use of ground penetrating radar gpr which is a fast nondestructive and efficient geophysical measurement technique gpr has been widely used to map subsurface features for example guo et al 2014 revealed a subsurface lateral preferential flow network via gpr in a hillslope fairly similar to our study area we hope to verify the fill and spill hypothesis using gpr in the future 4 3 surface runoff characteristics on karst hillslopes and implications several studies have shown that the sr coefficient increases with rainfall intensity such that a linear relationship exists between them zhao et al 2014 2015 according to our regression analysis of the sr coefficients r c and rainfall intensity r i r c 0 203 r i 8 377 r 2 0 998 p 0 05 f 447 9 the intercept of the trend curve at the horizontal coordinate is 41 3 mm h 1 which represents the rainfall intensity threshold that generates sr at the experiment plot this value is consistent with the previous results fu et al 2015c d peng et al 2019 we infer that this value tends to exceed the rainfall intensity of most precipitation events in this region therefore most studies in this region chen et al 2012 peng and wang 2012 qin et al 2015 have reported sr coefficients of less than 5 at hillslope scale regardless of annual precipitation which is much lower than that in non karst areas peng et al 2019 found that sr requires rainfall intensities between 30 mm h 1 and 50 mm h 1 our previous study fu et al 2015d investigated the same site as this study found no observable sr with a rainfall intensity of 46 mm h 1 we also found that the epikarst surface has a near steady infiltration rates of approximately 35 mm h 1 the relatively high hydraulic conductivity of the overlying soil stable infiltration rate varying from 42 to 126 mm h 1 and mean surface soil saturated hydraulic conductivity of 552 mm h 1 the existence of karst fissures and bedrock outcrops and the thin soil layer wang et al 2016 all enabled rainfall percolated into the underlying bedrock when the rainfall intensity was lower than the sei infiltration rate as rainfall intensity increased and ultimately exceeded the sei infiltration rate infiltrated water accumulated at the sei which led to the formation of the subsurface saturation area and generation of sr after soil layer saturation thus three distinct requirements should be fulfilled for the development of sr on karst hillslopes rainfall intensity larger than the infiltration rate of the epikarst surface rainfall amounts exceeding the threshold including the soil layer water capacity water storage via epikarst surface depressions and deep percolation and a slope that is not too steep to allow ponding of infiltrated water at the sbi to fill the soil layer similarly when these conditions were not met previous studies did not observe sr even during high rainfall intensity or laterally generated ssr fu et al 2015c d peng et al 2017 the limited water storage capacity of the thin soil layer when exposed to sufficient rainfall high rainfall intensity and gentle terrain slopes all contributed to the generation of sr in our experiments as well as during our previous studies fu et al 2015c d on the other hand at the catchment scale we conclude that less sr yield and flow concentration on karst slopes which causes rapid water transit from the surface to aquifers produces fast localized vertical water movement thereby enhancing groundwater recharge hartmann et al 2017 and possibly inducing waterlogging 4 4 steady sei infiltration rate sr was generated 31 min after the subsurface saturation area expanded upslope where the transient water tables at the middle and down slope areas were nearly consistent with the soil depth these observations correspond to the saturation excess mechanism of sr table 6 figs 4 and 5 fu et al 2015d a spearman s rank correlation analysis was conducted to determine the response time patterns of the swc water tables at the sei and ssr in the four rainfall simulation experiments table 8 which indicated that soil water at different depths transient water tables at the sei and ssr responded in an identical order confirming that the previous analysis such as the saturated area expanded pattern presented in fig 2 was universal we used the results discussed above to develop a method to estimate the steady sei infiltration rate the time frames necessary to generate sr were 57 31 and 18 min while the times to generate ssr were 42 29 and 15 min under rainfall intensities of 73 100 and 136 mm h 1 respectively the time required to generate sr was nearly identical to that required to generate ssr i e all individual trenches began to yield ssr 57 min after the onset of rainfall for a rainfall intensity of 73 mm h 1 the initial swc was the same for the four rainfall experiments table 3 therefore the soil layer required an identical level of water deficit to generate the sr the second and third rainfall simulation experiments were used to estimate the infiltration rate while the fourth was used to validate it the steady sei infiltration rate can be expressed as x mm h 1 we derived the following expression according to the uniform water deficit we estimated the steady sei infiltration rate to be 41 mm h 1 with a soil water deficit of 30 4 mm we then used these values to estimate the time necessary to produce sr under a rainfall intensity of 136 mm h 1 i e 19 min which is nearly identical to the observed value 18 min moreover this value was nearly equal to the rainfall intensity threshold 41 3 mm h 1 required to produce sr described in subsection 4 3 therefore this estimated value is reasonable the value is slightly larger than that reported in our previous study fu et al 2015c 38 mm h 1 which is likely due to the different scales used point scale in our previous study versus a plot scale in this study furthermore although the rainfall intensity in the first experiment 35 mm h 1 was less than the sei infiltration rate the runoff coefficient of ssr was minimal but not zero 3 5 this is because the estimated infiltration rate was the mean value of the experiment plot and depended on the weathering degree of the bedrock with a certain degree of spatial variability yang et al 2016 which allowed for only a small amount of ssr we also note that this value is useful in developing hillslope hydrological models as it represents the bottom boundary condition the relatively high infiltration capacity of the sei 41 mm h 1 decreases the likelihood of infiltrated water ponding at the interface to produce subsurface saturation areas this does not readily generate sr and ssr on certain karst hillslopes chen et al 2012 fu et al 2015d zhu et al 2017 the mechanism of sr generation is an infiltration excess and saturation excess mechanism where the infiltration excess reflects rainfall intensity larger than the infiltration capacity of the sei saturation excess implies that rainfall exceeds the soil water deficit water capacity of epikarst surface depression and deep percolation from the interface this mechanism corresponds to two thresholds for sr generation rainfall amount and intensity this could be generalized to the entire karst slopes of southwest china as it is consistent with the lower sr coefficients reported by many studies chen et al 2012 peng and wang 2012 qin et al 2015 gan et al 2016 zhu et al 2017 the rainfall runoff thresholds were 69 5 51 7 and 40 9 mm for sr and 51 2 48 3 and 34 1 mm for ssr at rainfall intensities of 73 100 and 136 mm h 1 respectively showing decreases with rainfall intensity this is because differences between rainfall intensity and the steady sei infiltration rate 41 mm h 1 increased as rainfall intensity increased thus there was a decrease in the time required for the infiltrated water to fill the epikarst surface depressions at the sei to produce ssr and exceed the soil water deficit both necessary for sr production this reduced the amount of deep percolation whereas water stored in the soil and epikart surface depressions remained constant 4 5 slope scale conceptual hydrological models for the soil epikarst system finally we propose a conceptual hydrological model to describe the particular surface underground double layer and three dimensional hydrogeological structures and runoff components sr ssr and esr generation mechanisms for karst hillslopes fig 7 there are three layers from top to bottom the uppermost horizon b is usually the thin soil layer that sometimes contains rock outcrops it is discontinuous and has a high hydraulic conductivity 26 255 mm h 1 the middle horizon is the epikarst layer having a highly irregular surface topography its depression area has water holding capacity and the layer contains various water leakage structures e g fissures conduits and sinkholes the bottom layer is the bedrock layer and is unweathered sr occurs at the soil surface fig 7 sr ssr occurs at the sei fig 7 ssr and esr occurs at the ebi fig 7 esr because the hydraulic conductivity of soil 26 255 mm h 1 is higher than that of the epikarst k epikarst 30 50 mm h 1 rainfall rapidly infiltrates and reaches the sei accumulates in the depression area of the sei until instantaneous water tables at the depression area reach the edge of the depression filling process fig 7c infiltrating and filling it spills downslope over the epikarst surface towards the trench face spilling process fig 7d fill and spill and ssr at the sei continues until the isolated subsurface saturation areas coalesce into one and reach the ssr rainfall amount threshold p t ssr when the instantaneous water tables reach the soil surface indicating soil layer saturation reaching the sr rainfall amount threshold p t sr sr occurs when the rainfall is large enough no matter the r i and percolates into epikarst fissures or conduits esr may occur at ebi as we observed that esr occurs earlier than ssr fig 4f and 5f soil water deficit estimated from field capacity wilting point and mean soil depth and epikarst water deficit estimated from mean effective porosity of epikarst and mean epikarst depth are also provided in fig 7a the conceptual hydrological model is divided into no rain fig 7a and rainy day fig 7b e and the rain events are characterized by their intensities r i and amounts no rain periods soil epikarst system water storage decreases due to evapotranspiration fig 7a rain periods r i k epikarst when the r i is smaller than the sei infiltration rate regardless of the rainfall amount no subsurface saturation areas can be generated in this case esr may be generated if the rainfall amount is large enough and percolates into epikarst fissures and conduits fig 7b r i k epikarst and p p t ssr when the r i is larger than the sei infiltration rate and the rainfall amount is smaller than the ssr rainfall threshold subsurface saturated areas will occur but cannot connect with each other thus no ssr is generated fig 7c r i k epikarst and p t srr p p t sr when the r i is larger than the sei infiltration rate and the rainfall amount is larger than the ssr rainfall threshold and smaller than the sr rainfall threshold the subsurface saturated areas will occur and connect with each other generating significant ssr which agrees with the fill and spill theory fig 7d r i k epikarst and p p t sr when the r i is larger than the sei infiltration rate and the rainfall amount is larger than the sr rainfall threshold then ssr and sr will occur fig 7e 5 conclusions the sr coefficient consistently remains less than 5 on karst hillslopes in southwest china regardless of the amount of annual rainfall and vegetation types from the hillslope hydrology perspective however steep and thin soil mantled karst hillslopes are typically readily saturated and generate surface runoff consisting of saturated overland flow this produces a logical paradox with the objective reality therefore in order to solve this paradox plot scale field rainfall simulation experiments were conducted on a karst hillslope in a humid sub tropical cockpit karst region of southwest china the results indicated that ssr was generated after subsurface saturation areas at the sei connected with each other then the fill and spill theory explains this process reasonably well sr mainly developed after instantaneous water levels reached near the surface representing an infiltration excess and saturation excess runoff mechanism this verified our hypothesis that a r i threshold exists in addition to the rainfall amount threshold which generate sr the rainfall amount threshold consists of three components filling of the epikarst surface depressions at the sei eliminating the soil water deficit and the amount of deep percolated water during the process the r i threshold must exceed the steady sei infiltration rate which is the prerequisite for the saturation of epikarst surface depression and soil layers the steady sei infiltration rate in this study was 41 mm h 1 which mostly exceeded the natural r i in this region it is the main factor responsible for the lower sr and ssr coefficients the steady sei infiltration rate may vary with hillslopes because of the high spatial variability however we believe that the value is large enough among karst regions because the low sr coefficient has been observed at different slopes in karst region of southwest china furthermore a conceptual hydrological model was presented to describe the generation mechanisms of runoff components sr ssr and esr for this complex and integrated soil epikarst system these findings are based only on four rainfall simulation experiments on the foot slope of a dolomite karst hillslope therefore a strict generalization that runoff characterizes all different karst hillslopes or different hillslope positions cannot be made further research should focus on the quantification of soil epikarst architectures and associated hydrological functions along this cockpit karst hillslope we believe that these results contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of runoff generation characteristics for karst hillslopes and will be useful in improving the prediction ability of the earth system models credit authorship contribution statement sheng wang conceptualization methodology investigation writing original draft

5993,southwest china receives abundant rainfall with a mean annual precipitation of 1450 mm 1960 2013 but surface runoff is small whereas subsurface runoff is relatively large on karst hillslopes however not enough studies have been done to investigate the mechanisms of surface and subsurface runoff generation in subtropical karst landscapes here we report the dynamics of soil water content swc instantaneous water levels at the soil epikarst interface sei and runoff characteristics related to the mechanisms of near surface runoff generation at the slope scale 5 m 20 m four field rainfall simulation experiments were conducted with rainfall intensities ranging from 35 to 136 mm h 1 subsurface saturation started first at the relatively flat lower slope and then extended up slope subsurface runoff began after subsurface saturated areas connected to each other representing a fill and spill mechanism surface runoff which mainly developed after instantaneous water levels reached near the surface represents an infiltration excess and saturation excess runoff mechanism where two thresholds must be attained rainfall amount and intensity the rainfall amount threshold is dependent on soil water deficit water capacity of the epikarst surface depression at the sei and deep percolation from sei the rainfall intensity threshold must be larger than the steady infiltration rate of sei which is the prerequisite for the saturation of the epikarst surface depression and soil layer steady sei infiltration rate was estimated 40 mm h 1 according to the surface runoff generation mechanism this parameter is important as it represents the lower boundary condition in modeling hillslope hydrological processes rainfall runoff thresholds for surface and subsurface runoff decrease with increasing rainfall intensity overall our results show that epikarst permeability along karst hillslopes is relatively high being the main factor controlling surface and subsurface runoff generation therefore epikarst permeability significantly affects near surface hydrological processes in karst landscapes our data contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of runoff generation processes and water cycle in the critical zone keywords runoff mechanism conceptual hydrological model subsurface runoff soil epikarst systems karst critical zone 1 introduction karst landscapes cover approximately 7 12 of the earth s continental area and about one quarter of the global population is completely or partially dependent on drinking water from karst aquifers hartmann et al 2014 the karst region of southwest china is one of the world s largest areas exposed to subtropical climates with a nearly continuous karst terrain covering a total area of 5 4 10 5 km2 fu et al 2015c cockpit karst is the most typical landscape style present in southwest china and is locally known as fengcong which is characterized by enclosed depressions of similar size surrounded by overlapping hills and ridges the regional bedrock geology is primarily composed of dolomitic carbonatites limestone and intermediate types these rocks have a dense structure low porosity 3 and low hydrochloric acid hcl insoluble matter 4 yuan 1994 previous studies on karst slope hydrological processes were conducted in either sub humid semi arid or mediterranean karst areas wilcox et al 2008 leh et al 2008 li et al 2011 the results from these studies cannot represent humid subtropical karst near surface hydrological regimes fu et al 2015d this region is characterized by fragile ecosystems controlled by geological carbonate bedrock and hydroclimatic rainfall and temperature pattern conditions as well as anthropogenic activities thus the region is subject to severe soil erosion and karst rocky desertification refers to the processes and human activities that transform a karst area covered by vegetation and soil into a rocky landscape which has had tremendous negative impacts to the environment and social and economic conditions at local and regional scales jiang et al 2014 the region is also subject to natural hazards such as frequent floods and droughts an analysis from liu et al 2014 revealed significantly enhanced precipitation extremes and flood severity across southwestern china over the past 60 years therefore knowledge of the mechanisms that generate hillslope runoff in this region is fundamental to combat rocky desertification effectively manage water resources and forecast flood disasters fleury et al 2013 hillslopes are a fundamental landscape unit for hydrological responses and also serve as a basic building block for many watershed models tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006b hillslope hydrology research can provide parameters for and can help to design the structure of watershed models integration of the hillslope structures into earth system models esms can improve esm grid level water energy and biogeochemical fluxes prediction ability fan et al 2019 moreover despite the importance of the integrated soil epikarst systems for karst water resources previous research mostly focused on karst groundwater only a few studies that directly characterized the shallow subsurface processes of karst systems have been conducted berthelin and hartmann 2020 in the karst region of southwest china slopes are characterized by a thin soil layer that overlays a highly weathered bedrock surface epikarst which is formed by soil filled grikes this is similar to other landforms where irregular bedrock surface underlays a shallow soil layer tromp van and mcdonnell 2006a graham et al 2010 this region experiences a high mean annual precipitation 1450 mm but the surface runoff sr coefficient on karst hillslopes consistently remains less than 5 regardless of the amount of annual rainfall chen et al 2012 peng and wang 2012 qin et al 2015 we found that deep percolation and subsurface runoff ssr are the dominant runoff components accounting for 71 and 9 of the total rainfall amount respectively zhu et al 2017 in contrast sr occupies less than 2 on karst hillslopes in southwest china in the rainy season from july 30th to september 30th 2015 zhu et al 2017 therefore the area s hydrological processes mainly occur at the subsurface level previous studies have shown that ssr is a dominant runoff producing mechanism in humid environments and steep terrain around the world weiler et al 2005 mcdonnell 2003 tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006b although wilcox et al 2008 and fu et al 2015a c conducted valuable research on subsurface runoff along karst hillslopes sr or ssr on certain karst hillslope plots have seldom been monitored through long term natural rainfall runoff observations zhu et al 2017 thus the mechanisms of sr and ssr generation on karst hillslopes merit further research this common response among various catchments may be empirically more meaningful than the particular characteristics of an experimental watershed mcdonnell 2003 infiltrated water the process by which water enters the soil pore spaces and becomes soil water that moves laterally down a hillslope through soil layers or on the soil bedrock interface sbi produces lateral subsurface runoff which contributes to a stream weiler et al 2005 studies in the early 1990s indicated that pre event water stored in a watershed before a rainfall event is the largest contributor approximately 75 worldwide to runoff in a stream furthermore vertical and lateral preferential flows are common in natural soils particularly in steep terrain buttle 2005 a transient water table is rapidly generated at the sbi after the onset of a precipitation event where this response controls the initial stage of lateral subsurface runoff due to the combined impact of three factors i an increase in the hydraulic gradient ii an increase in the cross sectional flow area and iii the formation of transient saturation areas across the hillslope weiler et al 2005 thus tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006b proposed the fill and spill theory to understand the development of ssr and explain the observed threshold behavior of the panola hillslope du et al 2016 found that low angle slopes exhibit thresholds and a fill and spill behavior similar to steeper hillslopes in previous studies we discovered that ssr is an important mechanism that generates runoff through field rainfall simulation experiments in sub tropical cockpit karst landscapes fu et al 2015c d ssr also fluctuates considerably with the permeability and topography of the soil epikarst interface sei initial soil moisture and rainfall intensity fu et al 2015d we also demonstrated the influence that the soil epikarst architecture has on near surface hydrological processes on karst hillslopes fu et al 2015c however our previous studies were mainly focused on runoff hydrographs in other words our observations of sr and ssr generation mechanisms were limited due to a lack of essential monitoring equipments fu et al 2015c d such as soil moisture or instantaneous water table monitors in this study we aim to determine whether our previous observations justify the fill and spill theory fu et al 2015d found that sr develops only under extremely high rainfall events and revealed that karst hillslopes produce sr from a saturation excess runoff mechanism however most karst slopes are characterized by a thin soil layer that overlays an epikarst surface e g a soil depth of merely 10 30 cm on the hillslope fu et al 2015b in this case the soil layer becomes easily saturated which should easily generate significant sr however in reality the sr coefficient consistently remains below 5 during natural rainfall events chen et al 2012 thus no sr occurs during relatively small rainfall intensities such as those in sprinkling experiments fu et al 2015c d therefore the saturation excess runoff mechanism is not fully applicable to karst slope sr gan et al 2016 also found that sr does not occur under a relatively small rainfall intensity on bare karst slopes once the rainfall intensity is large enough however the sr amount increases with an increase in the rainfall intensity therefore numerous studies have suggested the existence of a rainfall amount threshold that at a certain point generates runoff mcdonnell 2003 tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006b tromp van and mcdonnell 2006a graham et al 2010 fu et al 2015d we however propose that there is another rainfall intensity threshold that produces sr moreover chen et al 2012 found that the local substrate structure rather than land use affects sr generation yang et al 2016 several other studies have also shown that the permeability of the sbi has a significant impact on hydrological processes at the hillslope scale freer et al 2002 weiler et al 2005 tromp van and mcdonnell 2006a graham et al 2010 fu et al 2015d based on virtual numerical experiments ameli et al 2015 suggested that the physical mechanisms associated with ssr which derive from infiltration excess at the sbi are similar to sr due to infiltration excess at the soil surface both occur on slopes characterized by a highly permeable layer with high infiltration capabilities that overlies parallel a low permeability layer e g bedrock for sr the air layer serves as the high permeability layer and the soil layer as the low permeable layer thus the prerequisite for ssr generation is infiltration water perched at the sbi i e the soil infiltration rate must exceed the sbi infiltration rate karst slope soils have a high infiltration capacity with steady infiltration rates ranging from 40 to 130 mm h 1 chen et al 2011 allowing the infiltrated water to easily reach the sei which then acts as an infiltration barrier for the accumulation of water fu et al 2015d thus we hypothesize that the rainfall intensity threshold to yield runoff is related to the permeability of the sei on the karst slope fu et al 2015d found that the sei has a near steady infiltration rate of approximately 35 mm h 1 due to the sufficiently large soil infiltration rate in karst regions the rainfall intensity should be extremely high larger than the sei infiltration rate for formation of transient saturation area through which the subsurface saturation area can form and expand which ultimately leads to ssr and sr based on these previous results we propose a hypothesis where a rainfall intensity threshold exists in addition to the rainfall amount threshold to generate both ssr and sr moreover the rainfall intensity threshold is related to the sei infiltration rate then the following questions guided this study 1 does the fill and spill theory apply to the ssr generation mechanism on karst hillslopes 2 does a rainfall intensity threshold exist that will generate significant ssr and sr if so is there a relationship between this value and the steady sei infiltration rate 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description this study was conducted in a typical karst catchment 24 43 58 9 24 44 48 8 n 108 18 56 9 108 19 58 4 e in huanjiang county which lies in northwest guangxi southwest china the topographic catchment has an area of 1 46 km2 fig 1a and 2 b and andthe elevation ranges from 272 to 647 m 647 m above sea level the watershed is representative of cockpit karst and characterized by a flat depression 30 of the watershed surrounded by hills on three sides with an outlet in the northeast fig 1a approximately 60 of the hillslope land has a slope greater than 25 the near surface karst slope soil epikarst architecture system consists of a thin soil layer 0 50 cm 0 50 cm underlain by a highly irregular epikarst surface shallow and discontinuous soils derive from dolomite which account for about one third in karst region of southwest china and contain significant amounts of rock fragments the soil type is rendzina which has a texture between clay and clay loam 25 50 25 50 silt and 30 60 30 60 clay soils are well drained gravelly and calcareous with stable infiltration rates ranging from 40 to 130 mm h 1 chen et al 2012 the epikarst surface has a near steady infiltration rate of approximately 35 mm h 1 where the subsurface runoff occurs along the sei and is dominated by preferential flow fu et al 2015d the region has a subtropical mountainous monsoon climate with an average annual temperature and rainfall of 19 9 c and 1 455 6 mm 1980 2013 respectively approximately 74 of a given year s precipitation falls during the wet season between may and september our previous study hu et al 2015 reports more detailed information on the geohydrological conditions of this region 2 2 experimental plots the hillslope used in this study is located on the western side of the watershed figs 1 and 2 the general approach to studying subsurface runoff generation and movement in response to precipitation and snowmelt involves excavation to the sbi at the lower boundary of the experimental hillslope to expose the subsurface runoff tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006b fu et al 2015d twelve hillslope runoff plots 5 m 20 m were established at the lower part of the slope fig 2b each with a trench of 5 m in width the total width of the trench was 80 m where material was removed completely down to the unweathered bedrock an average vertical depth of 4 m using a backhoe the trench site epikarst was moderately weathered with a shallow soil mantle the mean soil thickness of the 12 plots was 50 cm based on a survey of the trenches among the 12 runoff plots concrete walls were installed deep into the epikarst surface on three sides of the plots the left right and upper edges to prevent sr exchange between adjacent plots the 12 plots were divided into four groups corn forage walnut and natural grassland with three replicates to quantify the effects that vegetation types on water sediments and nutrient loss a grassland plot figs 1b and 2 which experienced very little sr and ssr was selected for rainfall simulation experiments in this study to discern water pathway characteristics the grassland plot soil depth was surveyed on a 1 m grid using a 10 0 mm hand auger that was vertically forced through the soil profile to the epikarst the soil depths of the study plot range from 0 to 1 18 m with a mean value of 0 66 m and coefficient of variation of 0 60 the surface topography is planar apart from a bedrock outcrop at the lower left corner of the plot fig 2 whereas the bedrock topography is highly irregular there are some areas of deep soils of the plot between 4 14 m upslope from the trench fig 3 which are caused by large depression in the epikarst these areas of deep soils are defined as epikarst surface depression our previous study fu et al 2015d provide detailed descriptions of the trench characteristics nine soil samples were collected from up middle and down slope positions in replicates of three to measure the soil properties soil particle size distributions were measured using a mastersizer 2000 malvern instruments malvern england the soil bulk density of undisturbed soil samples bd g cm 3 was measured using steel columns 5 cm diameter 100 cm 3 volume via the excavation method the rock fragment content rfc was determined as the ratio between the rock weight and dry soil weight soil saturated hydraulic conductivity mm h 1 was measured using the constant head method while soil organic carbon soc g kg 1 was determined using the dichromate oxidation method fu et al 2015d table 1 lists the soil and epikarst characteristics 2 3 rainfall simulations and data collection four portable rainfall simulators were used to simulate rainfall with approximately 80 uniformity the structure of the portable rainfall simulators is described in detail by fu et al 2015d four rainfall simulation experiments were conducted between october 28 and november 4 2016 to understand rainfall infiltration runoff processes rainfall intensity r i was set to 35 73 100 and 136 mm h 1 to simulate medium to high intensity rainstorms in the region fu et al 2015d to conduct the experiments under uniform initial soil water conditions the plot was sprinkled with 200 mm of water once daily prior to each experiment all four rainfall simulation experiments consumed 200 mm of water and near steady runoff rates were reached at the end of the experiments table 2 lists the rainfall and runoff characteristics eight observation points were selected to monitor the soil water content swc at 10 cm 30 cm and the sei based on the soil depth distribution six of the eight locations were monitored for the instantaneous water table at the sei fig 3 shows the locations for swc and water level monitoring the swc was measured every 5 min using frequency domain decomposition stevens hydra probe soil sensor stevens usa water tables at the sei were monitored every 5 min using the water level logger u20 001 04 onset america the 5 m trench was divided into five equal sections and the ssr from each section was measured and recorded as subsurface runoff 1 ssf1 5 ssf5 from left to right a water pipe was fixed at the middle of the trench to collect sr another pipe was installed at the bottom of the trench face to measure epikarst seepage runoff esr which occurred at the epikarst bedrock interface ebi sr ssr and esr were measured by routing the runoff through a tipping bucket flow gauge with a resolution of 100 ml ssr and 1 l sr and esr tb1l hydrological services usa the lower edges of the experiment plot were covered in plastic film to prevent rainfall from dripping directly into the sr gutter fig 2c 3 results 3 1 temporal and spatial variations in swc patterns table 3 lists the initial swc at different positions and depths in the four experiments all swcs increased with soil depth among the three slope positions the initial swcs among the four experiments were compared and analyzed with a one way analysis of variance one way anova which indicated that there were no statistical differences among the four experiments p 0 01 thus the differences in hydrological processes among the four rainfall simulation experiments are attributable to different rainfall intensities rainfall intensity significantly affected variations in the swc table 4 lists the swc response times showing that it decreased with rainfall intensity at three depths and different locations with significant differences at certain locations the slope position influenced the swc response times at the sei table 5 from the down slope to middle slope and finally to the upper slope these differences were not significant at the highest rainfall intensity 136 mm h 1 figs 4a c and 5a c respectively show the swc characteristics for rainfall intensity at 35 and 100 mm h 1 at different depths and slope positions the swc changed rapidly i e rapid increase during the onset of precipitation and rapid decline quickly after the rain had stopped at which point they returned to the original levels prior to precipitation within 24 h these observations indicate a low soil water storage capacity and rapid hydrological processes on karst hillslopes in the sei the swc was sustained longer than at the top soil layers and significantly longer at middle and down slope areas compared with the up slope area this may be attributed to the lateral movement of infiltrated water and finer soil textures at deeper soil layers which are characterized by higher water holding capacities at greater depths below the surface 3 2 water levels at the soil epikarst interface the transient water levels at the sei represented the temporal and spatial patterns of transient saturation at the sei while the water levels wls at the sei relate to ssr initiation and generation at the trench face tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006b fig 3 similar to the swc the wl response times decreased with rainfall intensity table 6 indicating that the subsurface saturation areas formed rapidly under high rainfall intensity the wl response times had the following orders w6 88 cm w5 120 cm w8 141 cm w2 138 cm w4 145 cm and w3 139 cm fig 3 subsurface saturation areas were generated from the down slope to upper slope response time w6 responded first because it had the shallowest depth 88 cm the wls began to decline after rainfall had stopped and disappeared within 18 h fig 5d the disappearing times had the following order w3 w4 w6 w5 w8 and w2 the subsurface saturation areas vanished from the upper slope to down slope 3 3 surface and subsurface runoff hydrographs fig 6 a shows the time for runoff to occur sr ssr and esr plotted against the rainfall intensity for different treatments a negative exponential function was used to fit the curves zhao et al 2014 both regression equations passed the test of significance p 0 05 indicating that they precisely capture the negative relationship between these two parameters in other words the time to runoff decreases with rainfall intensity the relationship between the time to peak discharge ssr sr and esr and rainfall intensity is similar to the relationship between time to runoff and rainfall intensity which can also be described using the negative exponential function fig 6b runoff coefficients r c of sr increased with rainfall intensity r i r c 0 203 r i 8 377 r 2 0 998 p 0 05 f 447 9 these observations suggest that more rainfall was converted to sr under high rainfall intensity the increase in sr with increasing rainfall intensity was concordant with previous observations chaplot and bissonnais 2003 zhao et al 2014 figs 4e f and 5e f show runoff hydrographs for relatively low 35 mm h 1 and high 100 mm h 1 levels of rainfall intensity respectively consisting of sr ssr and esr ssr and esr dominated runoff processes under low rainfall intensity sr was not observed in the lowest rainfall intensity event 35 mm h 1 but did occur with increasing amounts as rainfall intensity increased table 2 figs 4 and 5 sr occurred later than ssr in all rainfall events table 2 rainfall intensity exerted a significant effect on the hydrograph shapes of sr ssr and esr figs 4f and 5f the hydrograph was flat for lower rainfall intensity but fairly steep for high rainfall intensity the peak ssr rates were 2 2 6 8 6 1 and 14 5 mm h 1 while the esr rates were 1 9 3 6 3 5 and 5 0 mm h 1 with rainfall intensities of 35 73 100 and 136 mm h 1 respectively the individual ssr characteristics were similar to those of the total ssr as discussed above table 7 summarizes the negative relationship between time to runoff and time to peak runoff for each individual ssr and rainfall intensity which can also be described using a negative exponential function both time to runoff and time to peak runoff followed a similar order regardless of rainfall intensity i e ssf5 ssf4 ssf3 and ssf1 4 discussion 4 1 variations in the swc and water table at the sei the soil water content at a depth of 10 cm was less than that at 30 cm and the sei which can be attributed to differences in the soil texture and saturated hydraulic conductivity between the soil at 10 cm and that at 30 cm and the sei as summarized in table 1 the soil sand contents were identical at 10 28 1 and 30 cm 28 1 but the soils at 30 cm had increased clay contents with an average of 36 2 compared with the clay content at 10 cm that had an average of 28 3 moreover the soils at 10 cm had a greater saturated hydraulic conductivity with an average of 174 2 mm h 1 compared with that at 30 cm with an average of 42 0 mm h 1 finally the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the sei was the lowest 16 0 mm h 1 compared with the soils at 10 and 30 cm therefore the infiltration water perched at the sei while lateral subsurface runoff contributed to the delay in soil water depletion at the sei all of these reasons caused the soil water content at 10 cm to be less than that at 30 cm and the sei swc response times showed a positive correlation with rainfall intensity indicating that the infiltration rate increased with rainfall intensity in our experiments however the effect that rainfall intensity had on the infiltration rate was inconsistent on certain soils surface seals decreased the infiltration rates with increases in the rainfall intensity dunne et al 1991 nevertheless a larger soil infiltration capacity than the rainfall intensity was maintained during most rainfall events due to the higher mean soil saturated hydraulic conductivity 54 9 cm h 1 in the karst area of our experiment site compared with non karst areas 2 55 cm h 1 for loess soil and 0 03 cm h 1 for glacial till soil wang et al 2016 thus the swc response times decreased with rainfall intensity the upslope region in the study area is steeper than the down slope region therefore infiltration water moved laterally from the up slope to the down slope where the swc at the sei first changed at the down slope and subsequently at the up slope the swc and transient water level at the sei rapidly changed throughout our experiments figs 4a c and 5 the thin soil layer relatively high hydraulic conductivity and presence of several fissures gaps channels and sinkholes lead to a poor water holding capacity and rapid hydrological processes in the karst area although the region has a subtropical mountainous monsoon climate with a large amount of annual precipitation more than 1 200 mm the karst terrain lacks sufficient soil water for vegetation growth fu et al 2015 wang et al 2016 2017 this unique drought phenomenon which is not induced by climatic but rather geological conditions is defined as karst drought chen and wang 2004 we note that all experiments were conducted in november 2016 during which rapid hydrological processes resulted in fairly similar initial swcs at different layers and slope positions table 3 providing further evidence that the soil has a low water retention capacity 4 2 subsurface runoff generation mechanism ssr is the primary runoff components in humid environments with steep terrain weiler et al 2005 fu et al 2015c d tables 5 and 6 list the response time of the swc and water tables respectively at the sei previous studies have shown that the development of the lateral transient water level at the sei controls the onset of lateral ssr due to the combined effect of several factors an increase in hydraulic gradient increase in the cross sectional flow area and the accumulation of subsurface saturation areas across the sei weiler et al 2005 tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006b based on our observations of the transient subsurface water tables when exposed to rainfall intensities of 100 mm h 1 fig 3 and table 6 we found that the subsurface saturation area first formed at the down slope and then expanded upward when the subsurface saturation area at the middle and down slopes connected with each other 29 min after the onset of rainfall this instantaneously generated an individual ssr ssf4 and ssf5 all observed individual ssr began 39 min after the subsurface saturation area expanded to the up slope the time to peak ssr occurred 69 min after the onset of rainfall suggesting that all subsurface saturation areas were connected across the entire slope at that time the expansion of the subsurface saturation area from the down slope to the up slope is inconsistent with the conclusion of tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006b who observed the opposite this can be explained where the down slope is gentler than the up slope in our study area which allowed infiltrated water at the down slope to perch at the sei expanding the saturation area up slope tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006b obtained a contrary result because the up slope was gentler than the down slope the relative gradient position of the slope controls the direction in which the saturation area expands the observed development of ssr agrees with the fill and spill theory proposed by tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006b infiltration water perches at the depression area of sei after which water tables reach the edge of the depression filling process and spill downslope over the epikarst surface towards the trench face spilling process as ssr continues until the disparate subsurface saturation areas accumulate into one area the rapid increase in the runoff rate figs 4d and 5d indicates that spilling processes were triggered immediately after most epikarst surface depressions filled the sharp decrease in the flow rate suggests that spilling processes ceased when rainfall ceased figs 4d and 5d thus the fill and spill theory reflects the mechanism that generates ssr and corresponding threshold phenomenon on karst hillslopes in this area our calculated ssr coefficients were quite small even when rainfall intensity was high table 2 particularly in comparison with the results of fu et al 2015d this is due to the fact that we observed significant ssr discharge from the adjoining runoff plots during the experiments which had not been counted inducing the low total runoff coefficients accordingly the concrete walls did not affect the downslope movement of ssr proving that the underground hydrological connectivity of the plots was not affected by the facility this can be attributed to an inherent characteristic of karst slopes i e the abundance of fissures conduits caves and sinkholes qin et al 2015 suggesting that the concrete walls were unable to restrict ssr however no concrete walls were installed in the study plot analyzed in fu et al 2015d furthermore fu et al 2015d monitored ssr at a trench face with a width greater than 7 m which encompassed the entire ssr direct observation of subsurface saturation area expansion is difficult therefore a secondary technique is required to validate the fill and spill behavior in our study area a potential method is the use of ground penetrating radar gpr which is a fast nondestructive and efficient geophysical measurement technique gpr has been widely used to map subsurface features for example guo et al 2014 revealed a subsurface lateral preferential flow network via gpr in a hillslope fairly similar to our study area we hope to verify the fill and spill hypothesis using gpr in the future 4 3 surface runoff characteristics on karst hillslopes and implications several studies have shown that the sr coefficient increases with rainfall intensity such that a linear relationship exists between them zhao et al 2014 2015 according to our regression analysis of the sr coefficients r c and rainfall intensity r i r c 0 203 r i 8 377 r 2 0 998 p 0 05 f 447 9 the intercept of the trend curve at the horizontal coordinate is 41 3 mm h 1 which represents the rainfall intensity threshold that generates sr at the experiment plot this value is consistent with the previous results fu et al 2015c d peng et al 2019 we infer that this value tends to exceed the rainfall intensity of most precipitation events in this region therefore most studies in this region chen et al 2012 peng and wang 2012 qin et al 2015 have reported sr coefficients of less than 5 at hillslope scale regardless of annual precipitation which is much lower than that in non karst areas peng et al 2019 found that sr requires rainfall intensities between 30 mm h 1 and 50 mm h 1 our previous study fu et al 2015d investigated the same site as this study found no observable sr with a rainfall intensity of 46 mm h 1 we also found that the epikarst surface has a near steady infiltration rates of approximately 35 mm h 1 the relatively high hydraulic conductivity of the overlying soil stable infiltration rate varying from 42 to 126 mm h 1 and mean surface soil saturated hydraulic conductivity of 552 mm h 1 the existence of karst fissures and bedrock outcrops and the thin soil layer wang et al 2016 all enabled rainfall percolated into the underlying bedrock when the rainfall intensity was lower than the sei infiltration rate as rainfall intensity increased and ultimately exceeded the sei infiltration rate infiltrated water accumulated at the sei which led to the formation of the subsurface saturation area and generation of sr after soil layer saturation thus three distinct requirements should be fulfilled for the development of sr on karst hillslopes rainfall intensity larger than the infiltration rate of the epikarst surface rainfall amounts exceeding the threshold including the soil layer water capacity water storage via epikarst surface depressions and deep percolation and a slope that is not too steep to allow ponding of infiltrated water at the sbi to fill the soil layer similarly when these conditions were not met previous studies did not observe sr even during high rainfall intensity or laterally generated ssr fu et al 2015c d peng et al 2017 the limited water storage capacity of the thin soil layer when exposed to sufficient rainfall high rainfall intensity and gentle terrain slopes all contributed to the generation of sr in our experiments as well as during our previous studies fu et al 2015c d on the other hand at the catchment scale we conclude that less sr yield and flow concentration on karst slopes which causes rapid water transit from the surface to aquifers produces fast localized vertical water movement thereby enhancing groundwater recharge hartmann et al 2017 and possibly inducing waterlogging 4 4 steady sei infiltration rate sr was generated 31 min after the subsurface saturation area expanded upslope where the transient water tables at the middle and down slope areas were nearly consistent with the soil depth these observations correspond to the saturation excess mechanism of sr table 6 figs 4 and 5 fu et al 2015d a spearman s rank correlation analysis was conducted to determine the response time patterns of the swc water tables at the sei and ssr in the four rainfall simulation experiments table 8 which indicated that soil water at different depths transient water tables at the sei and ssr responded in an identical order confirming that the previous analysis such as the saturated area expanded pattern presented in fig 2 was universal we used the results discussed above to develop a method to estimate the steady sei infiltration rate the time frames necessary to generate sr were 57 31 and 18 min while the times to generate ssr were 42 29 and 15 min under rainfall intensities of 73 100 and 136 mm h 1 respectively the time required to generate sr was nearly identical to that required to generate ssr i e all individual trenches began to yield ssr 57 min after the onset of rainfall for a rainfall intensity of 73 mm h 1 the initial swc was the same for the four rainfall experiments table 3 therefore the soil layer required an identical level of water deficit to generate the sr the second and third rainfall simulation experiments were used to estimate the infiltration rate while the fourth was used to validate it the steady sei infiltration rate can be expressed as x mm h 1 we derived the following expression according to the uniform water deficit we estimated the steady sei infiltration rate to be 41 mm h 1 with a soil water deficit of 30 4 mm we then used these values to estimate the time necessary to produce sr under a rainfall intensity of 136 mm h 1 i e 19 min which is nearly identical to the observed value 18 min moreover this value was nearly equal to the rainfall intensity threshold 41 3 mm h 1 required to produce sr described in subsection 4 3 therefore this estimated value is reasonable the value is slightly larger than that reported in our previous study fu et al 2015c 38 mm h 1 which is likely due to the different scales used point scale in our previous study versus a plot scale in this study furthermore although the rainfall intensity in the first experiment 35 mm h 1 was less than the sei infiltration rate the runoff coefficient of ssr was minimal but not zero 3 5 this is because the estimated infiltration rate was the mean value of the experiment plot and depended on the weathering degree of the bedrock with a certain degree of spatial variability yang et al 2016 which allowed for only a small amount of ssr we also note that this value is useful in developing hillslope hydrological models as it represents the bottom boundary condition the relatively high infiltration capacity of the sei 41 mm h 1 decreases the likelihood of infiltrated water ponding at the interface to produce subsurface saturation areas this does not readily generate sr and ssr on certain karst hillslopes chen et al 2012 fu et al 2015d zhu et al 2017 the mechanism of sr generation is an infiltration excess and saturation excess mechanism where the infiltration excess reflects rainfall intensity larger than the infiltration capacity of the sei saturation excess implies that rainfall exceeds the soil water deficit water capacity of epikarst surface depression and deep percolation from the interface this mechanism corresponds to two thresholds for sr generation rainfall amount and intensity this could be generalized to the entire karst slopes of southwest china as it is consistent with the lower sr coefficients reported by many studies chen et al 2012 peng and wang 2012 qin et al 2015 gan et al 2016 zhu et al 2017 the rainfall runoff thresholds were 69 5 51 7 and 40 9 mm for sr and 51 2 48 3 and 34 1 mm for ssr at rainfall intensities of 73 100 and 136 mm h 1 respectively showing decreases with rainfall intensity this is because differences between rainfall intensity and the steady sei infiltration rate 41 mm h 1 increased as rainfall intensity increased thus there was a decrease in the time required for the infiltrated water to fill the epikarst surface depressions at the sei to produce ssr and exceed the soil water deficit both necessary for sr production this reduced the amount of deep percolation whereas water stored in the soil and epikart surface depressions remained constant 4 5 slope scale conceptual hydrological models for the soil epikarst system finally we propose a conceptual hydrological model to describe the particular surface underground double layer and three dimensional hydrogeological structures and runoff components sr ssr and esr generation mechanisms for karst hillslopes fig 7 there are three layers from top to bottom the uppermost horizon b is usually the thin soil layer that sometimes contains rock outcrops it is discontinuous and has a high hydraulic conductivity 26 255 mm h 1 the middle horizon is the epikarst layer having a highly irregular surface topography its depression area has water holding capacity and the layer contains various water leakage structures e g fissures conduits and sinkholes the bottom layer is the bedrock layer and is unweathered sr occurs at the soil surface fig 7 sr ssr occurs at the sei fig 7 ssr and esr occurs at the ebi fig 7 esr because the hydraulic conductivity of soil 26 255 mm h 1 is higher than that of the epikarst k epikarst 30 50 mm h 1 rainfall rapidly infiltrates and reaches the sei accumulates in the depression area of the sei until instantaneous water tables at the depression area reach the edge of the depression filling process fig 7c infiltrating and filling it spills downslope over the epikarst surface towards the trench face spilling process fig 7d fill and spill and ssr at the sei continues until the isolated subsurface saturation areas coalesce into one and reach the ssr rainfall amount threshold p t ssr when the instantaneous water tables reach the soil surface indicating soil layer saturation reaching the sr rainfall amount threshold p t sr sr occurs when the rainfall is large enough no matter the r i and percolates into epikarst fissures or conduits esr may occur at ebi as we observed that esr occurs earlier than ssr fig 4f and 5f soil water deficit estimated from field capacity wilting point and mean soil depth and epikarst water deficit estimated from mean effective porosity of epikarst and mean epikarst depth are also provided in fig 7a the conceptual hydrological model is divided into no rain fig 7a and rainy day fig 7b e and the rain events are characterized by their intensities r i and amounts no rain periods soil epikarst system water storage decreases due to evapotranspiration fig 7a rain periods r i k epikarst when the r i is smaller than the sei infiltration rate regardless of the rainfall amount no subsurface saturation areas can be generated in this case esr may be generated if the rainfall amount is large enough and percolates into epikarst fissures and conduits fig 7b r i k epikarst and p p t ssr when the r i is larger than the sei infiltration rate and the rainfall amount is smaller than the ssr rainfall threshold subsurface saturated areas will occur but cannot connect with each other thus no ssr is generated fig 7c r i k epikarst and p t srr p p t sr when the r i is larger than the sei infiltration rate and the rainfall amount is larger than the ssr rainfall threshold and smaller than the sr rainfall threshold the subsurface saturated areas will occur and connect with each other generating significant ssr which agrees with the fill and spill theory fig 7d r i k epikarst and p p t sr when the r i is larger than the sei infiltration rate and the rainfall amount is larger than the sr rainfall threshold then ssr and sr will occur fig 7e 5 conclusions the sr coefficient consistently remains less than 5 on karst hillslopes in southwest china regardless of the amount of annual rainfall and vegetation types from the hillslope hydrology perspective however steep and thin soil mantled karst hillslopes are typically readily saturated and generate surface runoff consisting of saturated overland flow this produces a logical paradox with the objective reality therefore in order to solve this paradox plot scale field rainfall simulation experiments were conducted on a karst hillslope in a humid sub tropical cockpit karst region of southwest china the results indicated that ssr was generated after subsurface saturation areas at the sei connected with each other then the fill and spill theory explains this process reasonably well sr mainly developed after instantaneous water levels reached near the surface representing an infiltration excess and saturation excess runoff mechanism this verified our hypothesis that a r i threshold exists in addition to the rainfall amount threshold which generate sr the rainfall amount threshold consists of three components filling of the epikarst surface depressions at the sei eliminating the soil water deficit and the amount of deep percolated water during the process the r i threshold must exceed the steady sei infiltration rate which is the prerequisite for the saturation of epikarst surface depression and soil layers the steady sei infiltration rate in this study was 41 mm h 1 which mostly exceeded the natural r i in this region it is the main factor responsible for the lower sr and ssr coefficients the steady sei infiltration rate may vary with hillslopes because of the high spatial variability however we believe that the value is large enough among karst regions because the low sr coefficient has been observed at different slopes in karst region of southwest china furthermore a conceptual hydrological model was presented to describe the generation mechanisms of runoff components sr ssr and esr for this complex and integrated soil epikarst system these findings are based only on four rainfall simulation experiments on the foot slope of a dolomite karst hillslope therefore a strict generalization that runoff characterizes all different karst hillslopes or different hillslope positions cannot be made further research should focus on the quantification of soil epikarst architectures and associated hydrological functions along this cockpit karst hillslope we believe that these results contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of runoff generation characteristics for karst hillslopes and will be useful in improving the prediction ability of the earth system models credit authorship contribution statement sheng wang conceptualization methodology investigation writing original draft

5994,quantification of submarine groundwater discharge sgd remains a challenge due to its large spatial and temporal variability exacerbated by natural heterogeneity e g climatic conditions and hydrogeologic settings and anthropogenic disturbances e g dredging oil gas extraction and oil field brine discharges this study investigates the spatial and temporal variability of sgd during different hydroclimatic conditions in a semi arid anthropogenically disturbed estuary using darcy s law i e fresh terrestrial sgd and radon 222rn total sgd and radium 226ra saline recirculated sgd isotope mass balances continuous electrical resistivity imaging and 222rn surveys revealed potential subsurface influences on sgd with the highest sgd rates in areas with sandier substrates and near transitions from low hydraulic conductivity to higher hydraulic conductivity bottom sediments darcy estimates ranged over two orders of magnitude and were slightly higher following the flooding recession 0 09 8 28 m d 1 than following a period of low precipitation 0 02 7 84 m d 1 mobile continuous 222rn estimates 0 79 1 81 m d 1 support higher and more variable sgd rates similar trends to those previously reported from time series 222rn measurements 0 13 3 85 m d 1 across seasons radium 226 derived sgd 1 3 10 2 2 7 10 2 m d 1 using the average groundwater endmember fall short of 222rn derived sgd due to inability to account for radium tracer reactivity within the sediment however local darcy estimates agree well with the range of 222rn likely due to the steeper gradients near shore radium activity ratios and sgd rates reflect mixing of shallow and deep groundwater beneath the bay likely due to anthropogenic disturbances with a greater influence from deep groundwater 3 6 months following major precipitation events this study strongly suggests that semi arid systems receive significant sgd which in highly anthropogenically disturbed systems are derived from both shallower and deeper groundwater flowpaths and lag the climatic conditions by weeks shallow inputs and months or longer deeper inputs keywords submarine groundwater discharge sgd radium and radon continuous resistivity profiles crps oil field brine discharge oil and gas activity nueces bay texas 1 introduction the interaction between groundwater and surface water occurs at a range of spatial and temporal scales and is highly variable depending on meteorological fluvial geological and anthropogenic processes various studies have demonstrated that submarine groundwater discharge sgd can constitute an ecologically significant source of nutrients slomp and van cappellen 2004 urquidi gaume et al 2016 and metals montluçon and sañudo wilhelmy 2001 charette and buesseler 2004 rodellas et al 2014 to estuaries and embayments sgd may contribute to surface water quality degradation and mobilization of potentially toxic contaminants like nutrients heavy metals radionuclides and organic compounds from the sediment thus an improved understanding of sgd rates into coastal systems and corresponding groundwater solute fluxes is necessary to develop comprehensive biogeochemical budgets and management practices sgd is defined as any flow of water across the sediment water interface irrespective of its composition e g fresh or saline origin e g terrestrial or oceanic or driving force e g terrestrial hydraulic gradients or tidal pumping burnett et al 2008 moore 2010 santos et al 2012 yet individual sgd measurement techniques may not account for all discharge components for example regional estimates based on darcy s law account for terrestrial derived sgd based on the hydraulic gradient between the aquifer and surface water but few account for recirculated seawater li et al 2009 whereas estimates based on a radium mass balance approach charette et al 2003 may provide a reasonable estimate of saline recirculated sgd but fail to represent lower salinity sgd due to the salinity dependence of dissolved radium mulligan and charette 2006 contrastingly a radon mass balance approach may account for total sgd i e fresh and saline terrestrial and recirculated as radon is non reactive and does not behave differently in different salinity regimes mulligan and charette 2006 thus a combination of techniques is necessary to account for different components of sgd quantification of groundwater fluxes is difficult due to significant spatial and temporal heterogeneity and the inherent logistical complications of measuring a dispersed flux of water efforts to identify and quantify sgd have relied upon several techniques direct measurements using seepage meters lee 1977 taniguchi and fukuo 1993 sholkovitz et al 2003 electrical resistivity profiling to identify subsurface seepage faces and or porewater salinity stieglitz et al 2008 dimova et al 2012 bighash and murgulet 2015 thermal imaging of discharge plumes johnson et al 2008 danielescu et al 2009 kelly et al 2013 groundwater flow modeling wilson 2005 murgulet and tick 2016 and mass balance models using geochemical tracers such as radium ra rodellas et al 2014 radon rn burnett and dulaiova 2003 urquidi gaume et al 2016 and methane ch4 breier et al 2010 however each of these techniques has varying spatial and temporal integration scales to consider in the final sgd estimates mulligan and charette 2006 few studies have applied a combination of geochemical rn and ra isotopes and geophysical electrical resistivity methods breier et al 2005 swarzenski et al 2006a stieglitz et al 2008 with theoretical estimates to study sgd mulligan and charette 2006 santos et al 2009 it is likely that the variability of sgd is caused by spatial changes in estuarine bottom sediment type and anthropogenic disturbances e g dredging oil gas pipelines oil field brine discharges in conjunction with temporal changes in hydrological conditions e g drought vs flood some studies have 1 investigated sgd in arid and semi arid estuaries with high evaporation rates and seasonally variable precipitation boehm et al 2006 shellenbarger et al 2006 breier and edmonds 2007 el gamal et al 2012 urquidi gaume et al 2016 murgulet et al 2018 or 2 used both radon i e total sgd and radium i e saline sgd methods mulligan and charette 2006 swarzenski et al 2007 johnson et al 2008 baudron et al 2015 sadat noori et al 2015 to better constrain sgd furthermore these studies were mainly performed in higher permeability and sandier environments with minimum disturbances from anthropogenic activities some of these studies show generally good agreement i e on the same order of magnitude and or overlapping ranges between the radon and radium sgd estimates swarzenski et al 2007 johnson et al 2008 baudron et al 2015 sadat noori et al 2015 and indicate that saline recirculated seawater accounts for most sgd while just one study suggests that a larger fresh terrestrial sgd component is necessary to account for the greater radon estimate mulligan and charette 2006 a previous study of sgd in such an estuary nueces bay by breier and edmonds 2007 using radium mass balance methods found that sgd required to balance a 226ra budget was 160 of river inflows murgulet et al 2018 report sgd rates 1 3 orders of magnitude greater 0 13 3 85 m d 1 than breier and edmonds 2007 5 10 3 m d 1 using stationary continuous radon methods which further suggest high sgd fluxes in nueces bay and indicate a possible underestimation by the radium method we hypothesize that in a system with a high occurrence of dredging oil gas drilling and buried pipelines sgd may be locally enhanced by contributions from deeper aquifers along conduits created by these disturbances below the estuary i e short circuiting furthermore prolonged oil field brine discharges to a system such as this would influence the fate of reactive groundwater tracers i e radium this study aims to improve understanding of spatial and temporal variability of sgd in a highly anthropogenically disturbed semi arid estuary that is dominated by low permeability sediments i e fine silt to clay sediment seasonally variable precipitation high evaporation rates and low freshwater inflows we present and compare geophysical surveys hydrogeological estimates and geochemical tracer data collected quarterly over two years to estimate sgd behaviors during different climatological conditions and in different sedimentary environments we use radon and radium as conservative and non conservative tracers respectively to investigate the potential influence of historic oil field brine discharges on sgd estimates 2 methods 2 1 study area the study area located in the south central coast of texas was chosen because of its many anthropogenic disturbances and altered flow regimes that have contributed to its classification as ecologically unsound nbbest 2011 nueces bay is a secondary bay adjacent to corpus christi bay ccb within the nueces estuary system and has no direct connection to the gulf of mexico fig 1 nueces bay is 75 km2 in area with an average depth of 0 7 m and has the highest concentration per area of oil gas wells and pipelines fig 2 of the south texas bays breier et al 2010 rrc 2018 oil field brines produced during oil gas extraction activities were discharged directly to the bay fig 1c from the turn of the century until the practice was banned in the mid 1990 s d unger et al 1996 these oil field brines were often extremely high in dissolved solids which may exceed 100 parts per thousand and contained elevated concentrations of metals and radioactive substances the sediments in the vicinity of the discharges were found to contain high concentrations of oil field brine contaminants additionally oyster shell dredging occurred in the open bay prior to 1972 which further disturbed the bay sediments pulich 2007 consequently nueces bay has some of the most disturbed sediment beds in texas the nueces estuary is a microtidal system with a reported mean daily tidal range of 0 1 0 15 m diener 1975 nbbest 2011 given the shallow microtidal characteristics water level fluctuations in this bay are controlled primarily by wind nbbest 2011 average monthly wind speeds range from 17 to 18 km h 1 with a southeasterly dominant wind direction ockerman 2001 these persistent winds result in a generally well mixed water column and increased turbidity due to sediment resuspension the area is characterized as dry to sub humid with possible tropical disturbances during summer and fall shafer 1968 annual average precipitation and evaporation rates are around 76 and 145 cm respectively ockerman 2001 sources of freshwater inflow to nueces bay include runoff i e nueces river lateral flow and return flows from municipal industrial and agricultural sources and direct precipitation tdwr 1981 while the nueces river is the primary source of freshwater to nueces bay low precipitation rates within the watershed as well as hydrologic alterations i e dams and diversions on the river fig 1b lead to typically low riverine discharge into the bay as a result the bay receives low amounts of riverine nutrients while experiencing increased salinity levels longley et al 1994 murgulet et al 2017 present more information on the climatology of the area including fluctuations of annual precipitation and streamflow entering the study period december 2014 through august 2016 the state of texas was experiencing one of the strongest multi year 4 5 years droughts on record murgulet et al 2017 twdb 2018 which ended in spring 2015 with a large flooding event fig 3 consequently our study captures the progression from extreme dry conditions to extreme wet conditions rising limb and peak flood to post flood recession and back to normal conditions murgulet et al 2018 nueces bay falls within a subsection of the gulf coast aquifer fig 1a which is described as a leaky artesian aquifer in a layered stratigraphy of alternating and intermixed silt clay sand and gravel lenses forming the chicot evangeline and jasper aquifers shafer 1968 ashworth and hopkins 1995 waterstone and parsons 2003 nueces bay and the surrounding systems are generally in direct contact with the chicot aquifer extending 366 m below ground surface bgs which consists of an alluvial formation overlying the beaumont and lissie formations chowdhury and wade 2004 mace et al 2006 additionally a considerable amount of water discharges upward from the evangeline extending 793 m bgs into the chicot aquifer in southern texas most of south texas is underlain by brackish to saline groundwater at depths 150 m bgs with areas of high salinity occurring locally kreitler 1993 hydraulic conditions generally dictate that groundwater flows toward the river and the north shore and eventually discharges into the bays and estuaries nyquist et al 2008 breier et al 2010 bighash and murgulet 2015 bay surface sediments are predominantly sandy to silty sand across the north bay silty sand at the nueces river mouth clayey sand to clayey silt throughout the west bay and across the south bay and silty clay in the middle of the bay and the lower nueces river shideler et al 1981 2 2 sample collection the study was designed to investigate spatial and temporal differences in sgd surface water porewater and terrestrial groundwater were sampled according to methods outlined in murgulet et al 2018 briefly samples were collected quarterly from september 2014 through july 2016 from 13 to 15 stations selected from continuous resistivity profiles crps to characterize the different environments in the bay for the purpose of this paper the following station classifications are used for presenting and discussing results north bay 1 7 river 14 15 west bay 8 11 mid bay 12 and ccb 13 fig 1 water column samples were collected from approximately 0 2 m above the sediment water interface porewater samples n 25 were extracted using an ams retract a tip piezometer from depths ranging from 0 5 to 2 m below the sediment water interface ten groundwater wells with varying screened depths from 2 2 to 91 5 m below ground surface were sampled in may 2015 and october 2015 to characterize the shallow 10 m n 4 and deep 15 m n 6 groundwater endmembers fig 1b the hydraulic gradient of the regional aquifer was inferred from groundwater level data mined from the texas water development board s groundwater database gwdb reports water levels by aquifer 2017 all porewater and groundwater samples for 222rn analysis were collected in 250 ml gas tight borosilicate bottles filled from the bottom and allowed to overflow for one volume before being sealed with no headspace rn 222 measurements were conducted with a durridge rad 7 following the wat250 protocol durridge company inc 2017 within 2 days of sample collection to prevent loss due to decay half life 3 8 days and decay corrected to time of sampling a total of 68 surface water samples were measured for 224ra and 226ra from 9 stations north bay 1 4 7 river 14 15 west bay 8 11 mid bay 12 and ccb 13 and 8 sampling events large volume samples 50 100 l were filtered in the field through a 1 μm and 0 5 μm filter sequence to remove suspended sediments radium was extracted by passing through 15 g of acrylic fibers impregnated with mno2 sun and torgersen 1998 kim et al 2001 dimova et al 2007 these fibers were analyzed for 224ra half life 3 6 days within 3 days of collection on a durridge rad 7 following kim et al 2001 and dimova et al 2007 fibers were then sealed for 21 days to reach secular equilibrium before running for 226ra half life 1600 years on a durridge rad 7 following kim et al 2001 and johnson et al 2008 extraction efficiencies of mn fibers were determined to be 98 for 224ra and 96 for 226ra by processing random samples through a second mn cartridge analytical errors determined from rad 7 counting statistics were 20 for 224ra and 8 for 226ra at the 95 confidence interval 2 3 continuous resistivity profiles electrical resistivity er measurements were conducted using a marine supersting r8 ip resistivity meter advanced geosciences 2016 with a 112 m cable consisting of 56 graphite electrodes spaced 2 m apart which has the capacity to image to a depth of 22 5 m for more detail see murgulet et al 2016 douglas et al 2017 surveys were conducted on calm water with boat speeds 4 km hr 1 to minimize noise gps data and depth soundings were recorded simultaneously within the instrument using a lowrance lms 480 m with an lgc 2000 gps antenna while a ysi professional plus data sonde recorded continuous water column salinity and temperature these field measurements of surface water salinity and thickness of the water column below the electrode array are applied in the inversion to constrain the results so that changes in surface water conditions do not affect the resistivity model results for the sediment underlying the electrode array nyquist et al 2008 bighash and murgulet 2015 the system allows imaging of both the water column and the underlying sediments when the cable is deployed at the water surface two crps were measured in early september 2014 for a preliminary exploration of nueces bay from the river to corpus christi bay and across the north bay fig 1c at the time accessibility was restricted in the river and throughout the bay due to lower than normal water levels during the drought as such the lower nueces river was not surveyed until february 2015 when water levels had risen in the river sampling stations for geochemical sampling were selected from anomalously low or high resistivities appearing in the inverted resistivity images and with consideration for the geologic environments within the bay most selected stations correspond to locations with potential for high sgd but control stations with the least potential for sgd occurrence were also selected an additional survey was conducted in may 2017 focusing on north south transects fig 1c this crp was performed in conjunction with a spatial survey of water quality parameters i e temperature salinity dissolved oxygen do and ph and radon activity see section 2 5 2 4 darcy discharge rate estimates darcy s law estimates of local shallow brackish sgd were derived using water level and hydraulic conductivity data from four groundwater monitoring wells 10 m depth located near the calallen saltwater barrier dam standard slug in tests with the method hvorslev 1951 were conducted at the monitoring wells with a pressure data logger collecting data at 1 hz to estimate horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the shallow aquifer sediments as all four shallow wells were brackish the point water heads were converted to freshwater heads fetter 2001 before hydraulic gradients were determined darcy s law estimates of regional deep freshwater sgd were determined from twdb monitoring wells water level data from 2014 2015 and 2016 only wells less than 245 m 800 ft deep i e chicot aquifer were included in the construction of groundwater elevation contours fig 1b and calculation of hydraulic gradients the chicot aquifer has been found to have average horizontal hydraulic conductivities of 14 2 m d 1 range 9 8 19 2 m d 1 within 121 km of the coast with the highest conductivities x 18 6 m d 1 occurring within 80 km of the coast young et al 2016 a specific yield i e effective porosity of 0 05 for the chicot aquifer young et al 2016 was applied to convert from specific discharge to groundwater velocity 2 5 222rn derived sgd time series 222rn measurements at four locations within the study area fig 1 presented by murgulet et al 2018 are used for spatial analysis and temporal comparison with the darcy and 226ra derived sgd estimates in the current study given the spatial heterogeneity observed in the time series sgd estimates continuous mobile 222rn measurements were conducted in may 2017 surface water 0 5 m below the air water interface was continuously pumped to an air water exchanger rad aqua by a peristaltic pump while a closed air loop continuously pumped the gas through three rad 7 radon detectors connected in parallel the use of multiple detectors connected in parallel yields increased spatial resolution and greater precision constraining spatial heterogeneity of sgd the 222rn activities were integrated every 10 min or one measurement every 660 m at a survey speed of 4 km hr 1 and were used to estimate sgd fluxes following dulaiova et al 2005 and smith and robbins 2012 resulting 222rn activities and crps were mapped in arcgis for visual analysis continuous mobile 222rn measurements were used in a mass balance to estimate sgd as described by dulaiova et al 2005 smith and robbins 2012 murgulet et al 2018 briefly the model accounts for radon sinks atmospheric evasion radioactive decay and mixing with lower activity waters offshore and sources sediment supported 222rn and 226ra supported 222rn over time assigns any further source of radon mass to sgd inputs and converts to sgd fluxes by dividing by the radon activity in the advecting fluid wind speed data were obtained from the conrad blucher institute monitoring station 185 nueces bay the sediment supported 222rn activities and groundwater endmember activities from murgulet et al 2018 were used for the sediment supported 222rn correction and conversion to advective fluxes respectively for the continuous mobile 222rn survey in july 2017 226ra samples 40 50 l collected at high and low tides during a 24 hour stationary monitoring event that month were used to correct for in situ production of 222rn 2 6 ra derived sgd to estimate sgd from 226ra observations we use an estuarine mass balance to determine the excess inventory of 226ra attributed to groundwater flux in the bay this mass balance includes all sources of radium other than groundwater such as tidal exchange rivers and desorption from riverine suspended sediments moore 1996 in this study excess 226ra 226raex dpm d 1 is expressed mathematically as 1 r 226 a ex r 226 a nb r 226 a ccb v nb t w r 226 a r q r r 226 a des tss q r where 226ranb is the average activity in nueces bay dpm m 3 226raccb is the activity in corpus christi bay waters i e the offshore end member dpm m 3 226rar is the nueces river activity i e the nearshore end member dpm m 3 qr is the integrated nueces river discharge for the week prior to sample collection m3 d 1 226rades is the maximum desorption of radium from

suspended sediment concentration g m 3 in the river charette et al 2001 swarzenski 2007 after accounting for all possible sources of 226ra it is assumed that the excess activity from eq 1 is the result of sgd thus using 226ra activities from the groundwater wells in the vicinity of nueces bay sgd m3 d 1 is calculated as 2 sgd r 226 a ex r 226 a gw discrete 224ra and 226ra measurements across the bay were used to calculate apparent water mass ages moore 2000 to calculate the apparent radium water mass age or the relative time that has passed since the radium first entered the system tw we used the activity ratios ar of the short lived 224ra to the long lived 226ra 224ra 226ra isotopes johnson et al 2008 3 t w l n ar obs ar gw λ 224 λ 226 where arobs is the activity ratio of the samples of interest argw is the initial groundwater source activity ratio and λ224 and λ226 are the decay constants for 224ra and 226ra respectively this equation assumes 1 surface water ra activities and ars will be lower than the ra source i e groundwater or ra bearing sediments but higher than offshore waters and 2 the ra source is constant with respect to ars knee et al 2011 radium desorption experiments were conducted to determine the activity of 226ra released from riverine suspended sediments upon entering the estuary using representative riverine sediment samples i e 0 10 cm depth in the sediment column from just downstream of the salt water barrier dam near calallen tx sediment samples were collected when the river had been overflowing the dam for a week and salinities approximately 50 m downstream of the dam were 0 78 high salinity bay water 31 1 was collected filtered through whatman gf f filters to remove suspended solids and processed through mno2 fibers to remove dissolved radium known masses of dried sediments 15 mg and 870 mg were added to a volume of radium free filtered bay water 3 l to represent total suspended solid tss concentrations in the study area sample solutions were then stirred and placed on a shaker table for 45 min before extracting the desorbed radium by passing the solution through mno2 fibers and processing as described in section 2 2 total 226ra activity was normalized to the sediment mass and then multiplied by the sediment flux from the river typical tss concentrations in nueces bay range from 5 to 292 mg l 1 nicolau and hill 2013 for the most conservative estimates of radium desorption the experiments were performed for the highest 290 mg l 1 previously observed tss concentrations at salinities of approximately 30 25 20 15 10 and 5 the desorption activities ranged from 1 2 dpm g 1 salinity 30 to 2 3 dpm g 1 salinity 20 the maximum desorption activity corresponding to the salinity of each sampling event was applied to the calculation eq 1 an estimate of total surface inflow to nueces bay serves as the streamflow term qr as the usgs streamflow gauge for nueces river at calallen tx 08211500 being upstream of dams diversions and municipal intakes significantly overestimates river discharge to the bay freshwater surface inflow to nueces bay was retrieved from the twdb s water data for texas coastal freshwater inflow estimates for watersheds 21010 22012 and 20005 shown in fig 1b and c fernando 2017 twdb 2018 the region north of the bay encompasses approximately half of the 20 005 watershed thus half of the inflow estimates for this watershed were applied to the sum of watersheds 21 010 and 22012 table 4 shows the values of each term used for estimating sgd to nueces bay in this study using the 226ra mass balance 3 results and discussion 3 1 continuous resistivity profiles crp 3 1 1 preliminary crps exploratory crps conducted in september 2014 for the northern and southern areas of the bay fig 1c reveal several locations with resistivity anomalies average resistivity for freshwater saturated sediments like clay and sandy loam are typically 38 ω m and 51 ω m respectively nyquist et al 2008 the range of resistivities measured during the crps 0 10 10 ω m is suggestive of sediments saturated with high salinity water murgulet et al 2016 an observation supported by porewater salinities ranging from 23 6 to 40 8 x 32 9 n 26 over the study period vertically elongated features of very low resistance 0 1 0 24 ω m within mostly higher resistance sediments 3 2 10 ω m occurred at stations 1 2 and 4 along the northern transect and station 12 along the southern transect fig 4 a b and e f from crp image interpretation these abrupt small scale anomalies are not consistent with sgd plumes as outside these locations most of the subsurface within the imaged transect does not change significantly and is comprised of more resistant sediments the observed abrupt changes in resistance were found to correspond well with the location of some buried oil and gas pipelines fig 2 the resistivity signature may differ depending on the pipe material i e steel will have lower resistivity the composition of the product within the pipeline and the saturation status i e filled or empty however these types of bottom sediment disturbances such as sediment dredging and infill likely create exchange conduits between aquifers and bay waters by short circuiting confining layers as indicated by these preliminary crps other changes in resistivity that occur across a broader area and are confined to the shallower portions of transects correspond to oyster reefs confirmed by field observations fig 4b c and d e which settle on harder substrates when compared to surrounding softer more conductive sediments twichell et al 2010 and may influence bay chemistry and circulation patterns murgulet et al 2018 the highest resistivities measured in the subsurface were below the navigation channel crossing between nueces and corpus christi bays emplacement of bridge pilings and cutting deep into or removing the underlying low permeability confining sediments through dredging of bottom sediments could facilitate the flow of groundwater to the offshore water column burnett et al 2006 santos et al 2008 such as at stations 13 fig 4e f the lower nueces river is underlain by a few meters of more resistant sediments with increasing thickness toward the bay fig 4g h and h i two sampling stations were selected in this region one upstream where the resistive layer is more continuous station 15 and one in a slightly more heterogeneous resistivity area downstream station 14 laser diffraction sediment grain size analysis shows the percent sand in the sediments decreases downstream from predominantly sand or sand silt clay i e more resistive to clayey silt i e less resistive in the river mouth pena 2017 thus the higher resistivity in the downstream stretch is likely not explained by the difference in sediment types but rather by changes in pore fluid salinity toward a fresher condition station 14 salinity 23 6 31 5 station 15 salinity 38 7 40 7 this difference has implications related not only to different chemistry of sgd inputs to the river and bay but a possible indication of more significant fresher groundwater discharge at locations with higher porewater resistivity 3 1 2 north south crps the north south transects indicate that the middle of the bay is likely characterized by finer sediments and is not underlain by a more resistant layer i e sand as are the northern and southern portions of the bay fig 5 this finding is in agreement with shideler et al 1981 who show that in this portion of the bay sediments are mainly comprised of silt and clay the eastern n s transect close to stations 1 and 12 shows decreasing resistance from n to s in the deeper 10 m deep profile underlying an almost constant low resistivity surface layer to 5 10 m depth during porewater collection at station 12 and periodically at station 11 we observed soft unconsolidated and saturated silty clay to 3 m below sediment water interface this layer may indicate that the integrity of the bottom clay rich layer as a reliable confining unit has been altered favoring vertical advective flow barbour and fredlund 1989 gerla 1992 silliman et al 2002 similar to terrestrial occurrences of quicksand or soap holes toth 1971 the n and s shore transects show vertically elongated anomalies of very low resistivity surrounded by areas of higher resistivity which are believed to correspond to buried pipelines as observed in the preliminary crps see section 3 1 1 the n shore transect contains areas with the highest observed bay resistivity likely reflecting different depositional environments and a higher sand fraction the profile reveals a possible infilled paleovalley spalt et al 2018 a relict fluvial channel incised during a glacial maximum and subsequently filled with finer grained sediments as energy levels within the channel decreased with much higher resistivity areas confining a shallow valley of lower resistivity sediments russoniello et al 2013 shallow stratigraphic features like paleovalleys are known to modify groundwater discharge to coastal waters and geochemical processes across the sediment water interface sawyer et al 2014 3 2 sgd characterization 3 2 1 groundwater endmember characteristics groundwater salinities were brackish in shallow groundwater salinity 4 0 27 4 x 12 5 n 4 and ranged from fresh to brackish in deep groundwater salinity 0 7 4 0 x 1 6 n 6 in comparison bay porewater was more saline than terrestrial groundwater salinity 25 1 40 8 x 32 9 n 17 throughout the study period average 224ra activities in shallow brackish groundwater samples 650 4 793 6 dpm 100 l 1 x 725 9 dpm 100 l 1 were 2 7 times higher than those in fresher deep groundwater samples 21 0 138 6 dpm 100 l 1 x 61 6 dpm 100 l 1 however average 226ra activities in shallow groundwater 22 9 97 4 dpm 100 l 1 x 69 1 dpm 100 l 1 were slightly lower than in deep groundwater 26 5 238 9 dpm 100 l 1 x 76 9 dpm 100 l 1 the range of groundwater 226ra activities was consistent with those observed in shallow brackish groundwater 8 5 70 3 dpm 100 l 1 by breier and edmonds 2007 however because shallow groundwater was sampled following the recession of the late spring 2015 flood waters these lower 226ra activities could be a result of flushing of the surficial aquifer leading to an insufficient amount of time for the long lived 226ra to

porewater 224ra activity was slightly lower than that in shallow groundwater and 6 fold greater than that in deep groundwater mean porewater 226ra was 1 5 fold greater than both the mean shallow and mean deep groundwater for comparison porewater ars ranged from a minimum of 2 0 in may 2017 similar to the deep groundwater average ar to a maximum of 10 6 in january 2018 a value near that of average shallow groundwater ar the annual average porewater ar x 6 6 is like the average of all groundwater ars x 6 4 this large range in porewater ars and the considerable upward groundwater discharge within the gulf coast aquifer chowdhury and wade 2004 suggest that groundwater flowpaths fluctuate throughout the year and that porewater is likely a mixture of deep and shallow groundwater thus an average ar of all groundwater sampled during our study represents the mean porewater endmember for the current study salinity has been long recognized as an important factor that controls dissolved ra activities moore 1996 boehm et al 2006 as ra is strongly particle reactive at low salinities and becomes more soluble with an increase in salinity and ionic strength of the solution which enhances ion exchange however dissolved oxygen do and ph may also influence ra solubility in groundwater cerdà domènech et al 2017 at do concentrations less than 1 mg l 1 or ph less than 6 ra adsorption to the aquifer matrix has been shown to decrease which facilitates its mobility in groundwater szabo et al 2012a b salinities 5 were observed in all deep groundwater and one shallow groundwater sample

below the minimum activity supported by the sediment 1 6 103 dpm 100 l 1 were deemed compromised due to loss of radon during sampling handling or analysis lambert and burnett 2003 and disregarded from further analysis the average porewater 222rn activity x 24 0 103 dpm 100 l 1 is similar to the lowest deep groundwater and the maximum activity is greater than the shallow groundwater no significant

the porewater in the bay 12 3 103 dpm 100 l 1 this 222rn enrichment in the river porewater may result from less surface water recirculation i e less dilution given the deeper collection points i e 1 5 2 m into the sediment closer proximity to the bank and source of groundwater and or legacy of 226ra sequestered in the sediment from direct discharges of oil field brines into the river fig 1c in the

was more consistent and varied by 1 5 to 2 5 fold during each event the ccb seawater endmember experienced the least variation in both radium activities across the study period 224ra 40 9 73 7 dpm 100 l 1 x 56 3 dpm 100 l 1 226ra 42 8 72 4 dpm 100 l 1 x 48 7 dpm 100 l 1 likely due to the distance from terrestrial ra sources and consistently high salinity 17 2 38 8 at this location the nueces river 224ra and 226ra endmembers varied by 1 6 to 4 5 fold and by 2 1 to 6 2 fold respectively 224ra 20 0 90 2 dpm 100 l 1 x 53 0 dpm 100 l 1 226ra 16 4 101 8 dpm 100 l 1 x 57 3 dpm 100 l 1 with consistently the lowest activities during summer for both isotopes the most significant differences in bay ra activities between sampling periods are closely associated with flooding of the nueces river in summer 2015 table 2 fig 3 within the bay the lowest salinity min 0 2 max 6 5 x 3 3 and ra activities 224ra 21 8 61 2 dpm 100 l 1 x 43 0 dpm 100 l 1 226ra 19 3 36 6 dpm 100 l 1 x 27 9 dpm 100 l 1 occur in summer 2015 as a result of nearly complete flushing of the bay by nueces river floodwaters which first peaked three weeks prior to sample collection followed by lesser peaks 9 days prior to sample collection and one day before subsequent sample collection days fig 3 between spring and summer 2015 sampling salinities decreased from 15 1 to 31 7 x 27 1 to 0 2 6 5 x 2 5 because of these low salinities and flushing of the bay summer 2015 radium activities were lowest in the river and increased with distance from the river mouth consequently ra activities are greater in offshore waters i e ccb so radium isotopes are not suitable tracers of sgd during the summer 2015 sampling event as the assumption of decreasing activities with distance from shore does not hold highest 224ra activities were observed near the nueces river mouth station 8 224ra 21 8 147 0 dpm 100 l 1 x 85 6 dpm 100 l 1 and in close proximity to gum hollow creek in the north bay station 7 224ra 53 0 190 9 dpm 100 l 1 x 106 8 dpm 100 l 1 station 7 had the highest 224ra activity in each season apart from fall and winter 2015 when the river mouth had the highest activity this finding suggests the river and creek are persistent sources of radium to the bay however the 224ra mixing model and results from murgulet et al 2018 indicate minimal riverine influence input across the south bay fig 6 a d and f i except for in fall 2015 fig 6e furthermore during the drought the nueces estuary was hypersaline with mean salinities x 37 0 in fall 2014 and x 35 5 in winter 2014 slightly greater than typical seawater i e 35 and the lower river salinities as high as 15 fig 3b under these conditions maximum desorption from riverine suspended sediments likely occurred near the river mouth as there does not appear to be any riverine influence beyond station 8 fig 6f h thus elevated ra activities across the bay are likely due to inputs from groundwater and bay sediment sources alone rather than riverine inputs ra 224 was elevated in spring 2015 and 2016 compared to all other sampling events particularly at northern stations these increased 224ra activities in spring likely result from increased runoff and shallow groundwater discharge following the onset of the spring rains further supporting the link between the inland hydrologic cycle and sgd recall that shallow groundwater is more enriched in 224ra than 226ra compared to deeper groundwater these findings likely result from decreased contact time of waters with aquifer solids lamontagne et al 2008 changes in redox conditions or chemical characteristics of the aquifer matrix gonneea et al 2008 3 2 2 2 radium activity ratios and radium ages overall 224ra and 226ra activities in surface water do not have a significant correlation r 0 13 p 0 3 however three distinct trends separate samples into two strongly correlated clusters by ars 1 and ars 1 r 0 74 p 0 01 and r 0 78 p 0 01 respectively fig 7 and a riverine mixing line that only occurs in fall 2015 fig 6e these distinct trends suggest that there are likely two or more sources of radium in the study area charette et al 2001 one enriched in 224ra high ar and one deficient in 224ra low ar relative to 226ra charette et al 2001 these sources could reflect more deep groundwater input with its relatively low ars 0 4 2 6 or shallow groundwater with its much higher ars 8 2 31 2 bay ars 1 were observed during fall 2014 fall 2015 and winter 2015 and in the river in summer fall and winter 2015 and summer 2016 these sampling events occur in fall 2014 towards the end of a multi year drought 2011 2015 and 3 6 months after heavy precipitation and flooding fall and winter 2015 following long term droughts groundwater discharge from shallower aquifers is expected to diminish due to reduced recharge and the consequent lowering of the water table meanwhile deeper groundwater discharge may become more significant in the overall bay water budget due to a lag between climatic changes and deeper groundwater systems in addition deeper groundwater gradients may be enhanced as the surface water level is lowered due to large effects of evaporation and almost absent surface runoff inputs following the flooding event although the water table is recovering discharge from the shallow aquifer could potentially be accompanied by deeper formation groundwater input another possible cause of low surface water ars i e 1 could be scavenging of dissolved radium from surface waters and regeneration in the sediments it has been shown that radium may be scavenged during the biogenic formation of barite or opal bishop 1988 krest et al 1999 or through oxidation reduction reactions kadko et al 1987 see section 3 3 remineralized under hypoxic conditions and then could be released into the porewater and bottom waters storage of scavenged radium for just a few days would produce a distinct decrease of short lived 224ra activities compared to the much longer lived 226ra activities over time leading to lower 224ra 226ra activity ratios the ars 1 demonstrate a 224ra deficiency within the bay during fall and winter 2015 3 6 months following the occurrence of hypoxic conditions summer 2015 do 1 43 3 22 mg l 1 within the river and bay which indicates radium scavenging may have occurred additionally hypoxic to anoxic conditions are common in the bay porewater across all seasons 0 32 4 47 mg l 1 x 1 44 mg l 1 n 21 so the scavenging and release cycle may be taking place entirely within the sediment resulting in higher ar shallow groundwater losing a portion of its 224ra and discharging with lower ars we calculated a water mass age from radium ars for each season assuming the following groundwater endmembers 1 average ar of deep groundwater x 1 27 2 average ar of all groundwater x 6 5 and 3 average ar of shallow groundwater x 14 4 table 2 radium ages calculated from the average deep groundwater ar suggest a deep groundwater signature i e 224ra deficient or that geochemical processes occurring within the sediment may influence ars by facilitating a 224ra deficiency bay wide in fall 2 5 8 6 days and winter 2015 0 3 5 0 days and only in certain regions of the bay during other sampling events in contrast radium ages utilizing the shallow groundwater 8 6 21 2 days and the average of all groundwater 4 5 17 2 days suggest shallow groundwater is the dominant source to the bay during most seasons the 224ra deficient signature seen in fall and winter 2015 likely reflects the freshening of the bay sediments which increased sorption of radium to aquifer materials the increase in salinity with time is expected to be accompanied by increased radium desorption and input of 224ra deficient signature due to decay see section 3 3 nevertheless the deep groundwater input should not be ignored in this system recall the gulf coast aquifer is described as a leaky artesian aquifer composed of discontinuous sand silt clay and gravel beds thus the small scale heterogeneities and interconnections between the surficial unconfined aquifer and the deeper confined aquifers are not well constrained and it is likely that source mixing is occurring within the aquifer prior to discharge due to these limited constraints on aquifer heterogeneity and the close agreement with average porewater ars the average groundwater ar radium ages were applied to all stations 3 2 3 sgd rates 3 2 3 1 theoretical groundwater discharge rate estimates regional groundwater elevation data reveal hydraulic gradients toward the lower nueces river and the bay in the north but toward the kingsville drawdown shafer and baker 1973 rettman 1983 chowdhury and wade 2004 uddameri et al 2014 and away from the river and bay in the south fig 1b for this study all shallow groundwater velocities were determined using hydraulic conductivities measured from slug tests performed on four piezometers near the lower nueces river fig 1c measured hydraulic conductivities ranged from 1 21 to 5 8 m d 1 which are an order of magnitude greater than the 0 86 m d 1 reported by capuano and jan 1996 for similar clay and silty clay fluvial deltaic sediments in the upper 7 5 m of the beaumont formation along the texas gulf coast these hydraulic conductivities are 3 4 orders of magnitude greater than would be expected for silts and 5 6 orders of magnitude greater than expected for clays which may be attributable to macroporosity rather than matrix porosity capuano and jan 1996 shallow groundwater levels were measured in october 2015 following the recession of flood waters given that flood waters have pooled at the ground surface in the area with piezometers we expect that these measured water levels are likely more elevated than would be expected during a dry or normal year and would thus represent a maximum estimate for hydraulic gradients and discharge rates for comparison we revisited the piezometers in june 2018 after a moderately wet winter and a very dry spring when conditions reflected more normal conditions freshwater heads were on average 0 79 m greater under wet conditions in the piezometers with higher salinity groundwater n 2 but were similar between the wet and normal conditions in the lower salinity ones n 2 table 3 true groundwater pore velocities vp were estimated as the ratio of specific groundwater discharge rates q to the effective porosity ne an effective porosity of 0 05 for the chicot aquifer young et al 2016 was applied to darcy estimates to convert from specific discharge to groundwater velocity the groundwater seepage velocities ranged from 0 02 7 84 m d 1 during normal conditions and 0 09 8 28 m d 1 during wet conditions 3 2 3 2 radon sgd estimates time series 222rn sgd estimates presented by murgulet et al 2018 show large seasonal and spatial variability with discharge rates that range over 2 orders of magnitude with time and 3 orders of magnitude depending on the groundwater endmember supplementary fig s1 the 2017 continuous mobile 222rn survey supports the occurrence of generally high sgd rates 0 79 1 81 m d 1 throughout the bay fig 5 an increase in 222rn activity from 3 8 to 4 dpm l 1 to 5 1 7 3 dpm l 1 and sgd from 1 16 to 1 24 m d 1 to 1 58 1 69 m d 1 was observed across the north bay in conjunction with the highest resistivities observed in the crp see section 3 1 2 fig 5 other studies that continuously surveyed 222rn along coastal transects and rivers found that 222rn ranged around a low background value swarzenski et al 2006b santos et al 2008 but reached an order of magnitude higher where groundwater inputs were the highest while we did not observe an order of magnitude increase 222rn activities and sgd rates were twofold higher along a portion of the north bay near the highest observed resistivities and near the transitions from finer grain sediments to sandier sediments fig 5 for instance the highest 222rn activities 6 2 7 3 dpm l 1 and sgd rates 1 70 1 81 m d 1 were observed farther from shore near these sediment transition zones from predominantly silty clay mid bay sediments to more silty sand and sandy clay sediments in the north and south bay respectively shideler et al 1981 a lesser increase in 222rn activity 5 5 4 dpm l 1 and sgd rates 1 38 1 43 m d 1 was observed at the silty clay to clayey silt transition along the western most survey line fig 5 though not acting as a barrier to flow see section 3 1 2 these low permeability sediments may redirect some of the groundwater toward the more permeable sediment transition areas mentioned above this survey further confirms the 222rn activity variability and demonstrates that sgd rates may vary by an order of magnitude across the system as also observed with the time series stations murgulet et al 2018 3 2 3 3 radium budget bay wide 226ra derived sgd rates ranged from 2 9 104 m3 d 1 4 10 4 m3 m 2d 1 fall 2015 to 1 2 106 m3 d 1 0 04 m3 m 2d 1 spring 2015 using the average terrestrial groundwater endmember table 4 in contrast applying the average deep terrestrial groundwater endmember to fall and winter 2014 and 2015 seasons results in bay wide sgd rates ranging from 2 3 106 m3 d 1 0 04 m3 m 2d 1 to 8 8 107 m3 d 1 1 2 m3 m 2d 1 respectively these deep sgd rates are 1 2 orders of magnitude greater than those derived with the average terrestrial groundwater while it is unlikely the deeper groundwater is discharging bay wide due to subsurface heterogeneity this study strongly suggests that sources of sgd to nueces bay are from both shallow shorter i e nearby water table aquifer and deeper longer flowpaths i e confined semiconfined aquifers the influence of one groundwater source over the other is likely determined by the impact of local and inland climatic conditions on hydraulic gradients i e drought versus flood conditions disturbance of the bay sediments santos et al 2008 and the clay sediments failing to restrict flow but instead enhancing flow toth 1971 barbour and fredlund 1989 bighash and murgulet 2015 it should be noted that this method could not be applied to calculate a bay wide sgd rate for the summer 2015 flood event when the 226ra activity increased with distance from shore section 3 2 2 and thus violates the necessary assumptions for this model see section 2 6 breier and edmonds 2007 found that 226ra derived sgd rates in nueces bay were 3 1 105 m3 d 1 4 10 3 m3 m 2d 1 in nueces bay which was deemed too high for such a clay rich semi arid environment and in comparison to riverine inflows so the authors attributed this excess 226ra to oil field brine leakage from pipelines throughout the bay the current study found similar 226ra derived sgd rates which we believe to be likely due to groundwater discharge directly to the lower nueces river and the bay in fact even higher sgd fluxes are expected based on the 222rn mass balance murgulet et al 2018 see section 3 2 3 2 any excess 226ra derived from leaking oil field brines is accounted for in the 222rn mass balance as part of the 226ra supported radon step where supported 226ra is subtracted from the total 222rn measurements to calculate an excess 222rn burnett and dulaiova 2003 3 3 sgd intercomparison semi arid regions experience intra annual and inter annual fluctuations between dry and wet periods during wet periods precipitation exceeds evaporation so sgd is expected to be greater nearshore as the surficial aquifer is recharged and the hydraulic gradient increased however during dry periods evaporation far exceeds precipitation so sgd is expected to decline at the shoreline as the hydraulic gradient in the surficial aquifer decreases slowly due to reduced aquifer recharge furthermore sgd away from shore resulting from longer deeper flow paths may increase on a time scale of weeks to months following precipitation events due to a lag time and or as the hydraulic gradient increases due to greater evaporation rates lowering the surface water level more quickly than the water table the 222rn derived sgd fluxes reported here seem high for a semi arid region rebounding from a multi year drought compared to results from other regions and other south texas bays table 5 these 222rn derived sgd fluxes are even greater than those measured in the slightly less disturbed similar semi arid clay rich environments of baffin bay lopez et al 2018 and mission aransas estuary douglas et al 2017 spalt et al 2018 to the north and south respectively of nueces bay during overlapping sampling periods urquidi gaume et al 2016 used radon to investigate sgd in semi arid southeastern la paz bay mexico and found elevated sgd rates 0 10 0 18 m d 1 and nutrient concentrations in winter lagging precipitation by 3 4 months using radium shellenbarger et al 2006 reported higher than expected sgd fluxes ranging from 0 06 to 0 26 m d 1 in arid eilat israel after a 4 year drought and boehm et al 2006 reported 0 06 0 92 m d 1 in semi arid huntington beach california el gamal et al 2012 found low sgd rates 0 02 0 06 m d 1 in both wet and dry seasons in the arid marina lagoon egypt this lack of a seasonal pattern was attributed to either sgd derived from regional aquifers not influenced by recharge from local rainfall or artificial recharge to the surficial aquifer from anthropogenic activities while these studies demonstrate that elevated groundwater discharge occurs in arid and semi arid regions following drought conditions the 222rn derived sgd fluxes shown here and in murgulet et al 2018 exceed these previous investigations by an order of magnitude in some seasons and are more variable the large seasonal and spatial sgd variabilities observed with the time series measurements likely reflect different groundwater inputs i e regional and local responses to hydroclimatic changes i e recharge to the aquifer following rain events and anthropogenic influences i e oil gas activities dredging this is also supported by seasonally variable radium ars which as discussed earlier indicate either the occurrence of deep and shallow groundwater mixing within bay sediments fall and winter 2014 or responses to heavy precipitation events fall and winter 2015 in contrast to 222rn 226ra derived fluxes generally fall below rates from the above mentioned investigations but match the boehm et al 2006 range fairly well for rates calculated with the deeper terrestrial groundwater endmember i e the most conservative sgd estimates however deeper groundwater input as suggested by this current study although likely to occur is not expected to be predominant or the sole source thus next we are evaluating potential factors leading to these discrepancies both between methods of measurements and other areas similar in nature an intercomparison of submarine groundwater discharge estimates using 222rn 226ra and darcy estimates in waquoit bay ma by mulligan and charette 2006 found the difference between the total i e 222rn and fresh terrestrial i e darcy estimates sgd estimates to be in good agreement with the saline recirculated sgd i e 226ra in an unconfined sandy coastal aquifer however in the current study the difference between the average total and fresh terrestrial sgd estimates exceeds the saline recirculated sgd estimates by one or two orders of magnitude in all events possible causes of discrepancy are overestimation of 222rn derived sgd estimates underestimation of the freshwater terrestrial sgd component by darcy calculations or underestimation of the saline sgd component by the 226ra mass balance average 222rn derived sgd from stationary measurements are likely overestimated when scaled bay wide this overestimation may occur because stationary continuous 222rn measurements were performed at locations where sgd was expected based on crp analysis nevertheless the follow up continuous mobile 222rn survey indicates that high 222rn derived sgd 0 79 1 81 m d 1 x 1 36 m d 1 occurs bay wide fig 5 darcy calculations rely on hydraulic gradients and hydraulic conductivities from monitoring wells to the bay but this method is limited by the number of wells with water level data and these calculations do not account for unique geologic features like growth faults that may enhance groundwater discharge studies have identified at least three growth faults that transect nueces bay hammes et al 2004 brown et al 2005 and if these faults are active and extend to the surface within the bay vertical fluid flow may be enhanced along the fault hooper 1991 furthermore anecdotal evidence personal communications with rick hay suggests that growth faults may surface in nueces county in areas of active oil and gas extraction fig 2 incised creeks occur in the approximate locations of two of the identified growth faults north of the bay potentially indicating surfacing of these faults within close proximity to the bay additional geophysical investigations are necessary to determine what role if any growth faults may play in sgd to nueces bay given that porewater throughout the system was always found to be saline we consider other factors that may influence radium activity such as the rock source and reactivity of radium within the sediment all of which can influence the resulting radium ages and 226ra derived sgd epigenetic roll type uranium deposits occur heterogeneously throughout the regional aquifer system and preferentially leach 238u the parent of 226ra over 232th the precursor of 224ra from the aquifer which may then precipitate and concentrate at mineralizing fronts within the aquifer hobday and galloway 1999 consequently dissolved 226ra would be locally concentrated around these uranium deposits while 224ra would not which could contribute to the lower ars we measure in deep groundwater additionally fault zones may distort the ideal roll geometry of mineralization fronts which may lead to syndiagenetic uranium formation the product of circulating semi confined groundwater within sediments subject to extreme variations in eh and ph in shallow reduced or evaporative facies such as lakes ponds and marshes hobday and galloway 1999 consequently more radium may be generated in the shallower aquifers near the growth faults oxidation reduction reactions accompanying early diagenesis of organic matter can greatly influence the chemical nature of estuarine sediments kadko et al 1987 the rate of organic carbon accumulation influences the depth into the sediment where reduction processes occur i e rapid carbon accumulation results in the accumulation of manganese oxides within centimeters of the sediment water interface as sediments accumulate and are buried manganese may be mobilized in sediment porewater where it becomes oxidized and precipitates within the shallow oxic zone thus creating a highly mn rich layer the depth of this layer is principally governed by the balance between downward o2 diffusion and upward mn2 diffusion the discharge of oil field brines between 1920 s until 1993 into nueces bay d unger et al 1996 is an indication that the presence of a mn rich layer may be significant in our study area as manganese is present in many oil field brines collins 1975 manganese oxides are important scavengers of radium and other trace elements in marine environments and the adsorptive properties of the upper sediment column can be significantly altered by the redistribution and concentration of manganese oxides kadko et al 1987 consequently dissolved radium in the upwelling groundwater may be sequestered in the bottom sediments as the water passes through reducing fronts or the mn rich layer in the upper 1 2 m of bay sediments which leads to lower 226ra derived sgd estimates compared to 222rn based estimates further investigation into the redox chemistry and radium activities within the sediment are needed to elucidate the impact of these processes the discharge of oil field brines may have major effects on sgd estimates not only related to the possible scavenging of radium i e the mn rich layer and underestimation of discharge rates but as an unaccounted for source of 222rn and overestimation of discharge rates typical oil field produced waters from the corpus christi area had salinities from 17 5 to 36 3 and 226ra activities from 240 to 3470 dpm 100 l 1 kraemer and reid 1984 given the density of these produced waters they would likely have downwelled into the sediments where depending on the redox conditions organic matter concentrations salinity and temperature the dissolved 226ra and other contaminants may have become sediment bound warner et al 2013 thus potentially contributing to the higher observed 222rn activities and lower dissolved 226ra activities in porewater the greatest density of historic discharge locations occurs around white point in the north western portion of the bay fig 1c which also coincides with the region of greatest hydraulic gradients fig 1b findings here indicate that to select the most appropriate sgd tracer in any given system several factors must be considered tracer enrichment in the groundwater porewater relative to surface water tracer reactivity in the environment and the ability to quantify the sources and sinks of naturally occurring tracers santos et al 2008 as discussed above there are many processes that may influence the activities of dissolved radium within a system whereas 222rn is conservative which simplifies analysis of its sources and sinks on all accounts 222rn appears to be the preferred groundwater tracer in this system 4 conclusions the objectives of this study were to examine the spatial and temporal variability of sgd in a semi arid micro tidal highly anthropogenically disturbed bay dominated by low hydraulic conductivity sediments through the application of several techniques to account for all components of sgd in this study 1 continuous resistivity surveys showed resistivity anomalies that were identified as buried oil gas pipelines and potentially significant groundwater seepage faces in the lower nueces river near the river mouth and in the middle and along the northern shore of nueces bay 2 a crp in conjunction with a continuous 222rn survey highlighted the influence of different lithologies on sgd rates with the greatest sgd rates observed in higher hydraulic conductivity sediments and at transitions from low hydraulic conductivity mid bay sediments to higher hydraulic conductivity north and south bay sediments 3 radium activity ratios reveal useful information for groundwater source identification with surface water ratios following two distinct trends that suggest a high ar shallow groundwater source or a low ar deep groundwater source porewater ar align very well with the average ar of all groundwater an indication that source mixing occurs in the subsurface beneath the bay and 4 226ra derived saline recirculated estimates fall short of 222rn derived total sgd due to inability to account for radium tracer reactivity within the sediment however local darcy fresh terrestrial estimates agree well with the range of 222rn derived sgd estimates likely due to the steeper gradients near shore results of this study indicate that semi arid systems receive significant sgd and that highly anthropogenically disturbed systems may experience sgd from both shallower shorter and deeper longer groundwater flowpaths and potentially lag the climatic conditions by weeks surficial aquifers and months or longer deeper aquifers this study demonstrates the importance of characterizing natural heterogeneities i e sediment type depositional environment growth faults and anthropogenic disturbances i e oil gas drilling dredging oil field brine discharges within a system to improve understanding of spatial and temporal variations in sgd rates this investigation demonstrated that 222rn is the preferred groundwater tracer in nueces bay because it is enriched in groundwater and porewater compared to bay waters and is non reactive compared to radium to further understand the processes controlling radium cycling in this system a detailed study of bay sediment and porewater composition chemistry is necessary to address 1 any legacy radionuclide deposits from historic oil field brine discharges that may not be accounted for in the 222rn mass balance and thus contribute to the high 222rn derived sgd rates 2 the redox conditions within the sediment that influence the cycling of ra in the subsurface and may contribute to changing activity ratios as ra isotopes cycle through adsorption desorption from sediment particles and 3 the depth and thickness of the fe and mn hydr oxide rich layer that may sequester ra from the upwelling groundwater additionally further geophysical investigations i e seismic surveys of the bay are needed to reveal the location s of growth faults throughout the bay where future sgd studies could focus to determine whether the faults contribute to sgd future studies in regions with active oil gas extraction should consider the linkage between anthropogenic disturbances i e oil gas extraction drilling dredging and natural subsurface heterogeneities i e hydroclimatic and

5994,quantification of submarine groundwater discharge sgd remains a challenge due to its large spatial and temporal variability exacerbated by natural heterogeneity e g climatic conditions and hydrogeologic settings and anthropogenic disturbances e g dredging oil gas extraction and oil field brine discharges this study investigates the spatial and temporal variability of sgd during different hydroclimatic conditions in a semi arid anthropogenically disturbed estuary using darcy s law i e fresh terrestrial sgd and radon 222rn total sgd and radium 226ra saline recirculated sgd isotope mass balances continuous electrical resistivity imaging and 222rn surveys revealed potential subsurface influences on sgd with the highest sgd rates in areas with sandier substrates and near transitions from low hydraulic conductivity to higher hydraulic conductivity bottom sediments darcy estimates ranged over two orders of magnitude and were slightly higher following the flooding

derived sgd due to inability to account for radium tracer reactivity within the sediment however local darcy estimates agree well with the range of 222rn likely due to the steeper gradients near shore radium activity ratios and sgd rates reflect mixing of shallow and deep groundwater beneath the bay likely due to anthropogenic disturbances with a greater influence from deep groundwater 3 6 months

deeper groundwater flowpaths and lag the climatic conditions by weeks shallow inputs and months or longer deeper inputs keywords submarine groundwater discharge sgd radium and radon continuous resistivity profiles crps oil field brine discharge oil and gas activity nueces bay texas 1 introduction the interaction between groundwater and surface water occurs at a range of spatial and temporal scales and is highly variable depending on meteorological fluvial geological and anthropogenic processes various studies have demonstrated that submarine groundwater discharge sgd can constitute an ecologically significant source of nutrients slomp and van cappellen 2004 urquidi gaume et al 2016 and metals montluçon and sañudo wilhelmy 2001 charette and buesseler 2004 rodellas et al 2014 to estuaries and embayments sgd may contribute to surface water quality degradation and mobilization of potentially toxic contaminants like nutrients heavy metals radionuclides and organic compounds from the sediment thus an improved understanding of sgd rates into coastal systems and corresponding groundwater solute fluxes is necessary to develop comprehensive biogeochemical budgets and management practices sgd is defined as any flow of water across the sediment water interface irrespective of its composition e g fresh or saline origin e g terrestrial or oceanic or driving force e g terrestrial hydraulic gradients or tidal pumping burnett et al 2008 moore 2010 santos et al 2012 yet individual sgd measurement techniques may not account for all discharge components for example regional estimates based on darcy s law account for terrestrial derived sgd based on the hydraulic gradient between the aquifer and surface water but few account for recirculated seawater li et al 2009 whereas estimates based on a radium mass balance approach charette et al 2003 may provide a reasonable estimate of saline recirculated sgd but fail to represent lower salinity sgd due to the salinity dependence of dissolved radium mulligan and charette 2006 contrastingly a radon mass balance approach may account for total sgd i e fresh and saline terrestrial and recirculated as radon is non reactive and does not behave differently in different salinity regimes mulligan and charette 2006 thus a combination of techniques is necessary to account for different components of sgd quantification of groundwater fluxes is difficult due to significant spatial and temporal heterogeneity and the inherent logistical complications of measuring a dispersed flux of water efforts to identify and quantify sgd have relied upon several techniques direct measurements using seepage meters lee 1977 taniguchi and fukuo 1993 sholkovitz et al 2003 electrical resistivity profiling to identify subsurface seepage faces and or porewater salinity stieglitz et al 2008 dimova et al 2012 bighash and murgulet 2015 thermal imaging of discharge plumes johnson et al 2008 danielescu et al 2009 kelly et al 2013 groundwater flow modeling wilson 2005 murgulet and tick 2016 and mass balance models using geochemical tracers such as radium ra rodellas et al 2014 radon rn burnett and dulaiova 2003 urquidi gaume et al 2016 and methane ch4 breier et al 2010 however each of these techniques has varying spatial and temporal integration scales to consider in the final sgd estimates mulligan and charette 2006 few studies have applied a combination of geochemical rn and ra isotopes and geophysical electrical resistivity methods breier et al 2005 swarzenski et al 2006a stieglitz et al 2008 with theoretical estimates to study sgd mulligan and charette 2006 santos et al 2009 it is likely that the variability of sgd is caused by spatial changes in estuarine bottom sediment type and anthropogenic disturbances e g dredging oil gas pipelines oil field brine discharges in conjunction with temporal changes in hydrological conditions e g drought vs flood some studies have 1 investigated sgd in arid and semi arid estuaries with high evaporation rates and seasonally variable precipitation boehm et al 2006 shellenbarger et al 2006 breier and edmonds 2007 el gamal et al 2012 urquidi gaume et al 2016 murgulet et al 2018 or 2 used both radon i e total sgd and radium i e saline sgd methods mulligan and charette 2006 swarzenski et al 2007 johnson et al 2008 baudron et al 2015 sadat noori et al 2015 to better constrain sgd furthermore these studies were mainly performed in higher permeability and sandier environments with minimum disturbances from anthropogenic activities some of these studies show generally good agreement i e on the same order of magnitude and or overlapping ranges between the radon and radium sgd estimates swarzenski et al 2007 johnson et al 2008 baudron et al 2015 sadat noori et al 2015 and indicate that saline recirculated seawater accounts for most sgd while just one study suggests that a larger fresh terrestrial sgd component is necessary to account for the greater radon estimate mulligan and charette 2006 a previous study of sgd in such an estuary nueces bay by breier and edmonds 2007 using radium mass balance methods found that sgd required to balance a 226ra budget was 160 of river inflows murgulet et al 2018 report sgd rates 1 3 orders of magnitude greater 0 13 3 85 m d 1 than breier and edmonds 2007 5 10 3 m d 1 using stationary continuous radon methods which further suggest high sgd fluxes in nueces bay and indicate a possible underestimation by the radium method we hypothesize that in a system with a high occurrence of dredging oil gas drilling and buried pipelines sgd may be locally enhanced by contributions from deeper aquifers along conduits created by these disturbances below the estuary i e short circuiting furthermore prolonged oil field brine discharges to a system such as this would influence the fate of reactive groundwater tracers i e radium this study aims to improve understanding of spatial and temporal variability of sgd in a highly anthropogenically disturbed semi arid estuary that is dominated by low permeability sediments i e fine silt to clay sediment seasonally variable precipitation high evaporation rates and low freshwater inflows we present and compare geophysical surveys hydrogeological estimates and geochemical tracer data collected quarterly over two years to estimate sgd behaviors during different climatological conditions and in different sedimentary environments we use radon and radium as conservative and non conservative tracers respectively to investigate the potential influence of historic oil field brine discharges on sgd estimates 2 methods 2 1 study area the study area located in the south central coast of texas was chosen because of its many anthropogenic disturbances and altered flow regimes that have contributed to its classification as ecologically unsound nbbest 2011 nueces bay is a secondary bay adjacent to corpus christi bay ccb within the nueces estuary system and has no direct connection to the gulf of mexico fig 1 nueces bay is 75 km2 in area with an average depth of 0 7 m and has the highest concentration per area of oil gas wells and pipelines fig 2 of the south texas bays breier et al 2010 rrc 2018 oil field brines produced during oil gas extraction activities were discharged directly to the bay fig 1c from the turn of the century until the practice was banned in the mid 1990 s d unger et al 1996 these oil field brines were often extremely high in dissolved solids which may exceed 100 parts per thousand and contained elevated concentrations of metals and radioactive substances the sediments in the vicinity of the discharges were found to contain high concentrations of oil field brine contaminants additionally oyster shell dredging occurred in the open bay prior to 1972 which further disturbed the bay sediments pulich 2007 consequently nueces bay has some of the most disturbed sediment beds in texas the nueces estuary is a microtidal system with a reported mean daily tidal range of 0 1 0 15 m diener 1975 nbbest 2011 given the shallow microtidal characteristics water level fluctuations in this bay are controlled primarily by wind nbbest 2011 average monthly wind speeds range from 17 to 18 km h 1 with a southeasterly dominant wind direction ockerman 2001 these persistent winds result in a generally well mixed water column and increased turbidity due to sediment resuspension the area is characterized as dry to sub humid with possible tropical disturbances during summer and fall shafer 1968 annual average precipitation and evaporation rates are around 76 and 145 cm respectively ockerman 2001 sources of freshwater inflow to nueces bay include runoff i e nueces river lateral flow and return flows from municipal industrial and agricultural sources and direct precipitation tdwr 1981 while the nueces river is the primary source of freshwater to nueces bay low precipitation rates within the watershed as well as hydrologic alterations i e dams and diversions on the river fig 1b lead to typically low riverine discharge into the bay as a result the bay receives low amounts of riverine nutrients while experiencing increased salinity levels longley et al 1994 murgulet et al 2017 present more information on the climatology of the area including fluctuations of annual precipitation and streamflow entering the study period december 2014 through august 2016 the state of texas was experiencing one of the strongest multi year 4 5 years droughts on record murgulet et al 2017 twdb 2018 which ended in spring 2015 with a large flooding event fig 3 consequently our study captures the progression from extreme dry conditions to extreme wet conditions rising limb and peak flood to post flood recession and back to normal conditions murgulet et al 2018 nueces bay falls within a subsection of the gulf coast aquifer fig 1a which is described as a leaky artesian aquifer in a layered stratigraphy of alternating and intermixed silt clay sand and gravel lenses forming the chicot evangeline and jasper aquifers shafer 1968 ashworth and hopkins 1995 waterstone and parsons 2003 nueces bay and the surrounding systems are generally in direct contact with the chicot aquifer extending 366 m below ground surface bgs which consists of an alluvial formation overlying the beaumont and lissie formations chowdhury and wade 2004 mace et al 2006 additionally a considerable amount of water discharges upward from the evangeline extending 793 m bgs into the chicot aquifer in southern texas most of south texas is underlain by brackish to saline groundwater at depths 150 m bgs with areas of high salinity occurring locally kreitler 1993 hydraulic conditions generally dictate that groundwater flows toward the river and the north shore and eventually discharges into the bays and estuaries nyquist et al 2008 breier et al 2010 bighash and murgulet 2015 bay surface sediments are predominantly sandy to silty sand across the north bay silty sand at the nueces river mouth clayey sand to clayey silt throughout the west bay and across the south bay and silty clay in the middle of the bay and the lower nueces river shideler et al 1981 2 2 sample collection the study was designed to investigate spatial and temporal differences in sgd surface water porewater and terrestrial groundwater were sampled according to methods outlined in murgulet et al 2018 briefly samples were collected quarterly from september 2014 through july 2016 from 13 to 15 stations selected from continuous resistivity profiles crps to characterize the different environments in the bay for the purpose of this paper the following station classifications are used for presenting and discussing results north bay 1 7 river 14 15 west bay 8 11 mid bay 12 and ccb 13 fig 1 water column samples were collected from approximately 0 2 m above the sediment water interface porewater samples n 25 were extracted using an ams retract a tip piezometer from depths ranging from 0 5 to 2 m below the sediment water interface ten groundwater wells with varying screened depths from 2 2 to 91 5 m below ground surface were sampled in may 2015 and october 2015 to characterize the shallow 10 m n 4 and deep 15 m n 6 groundwater endmembers fig 1b the hydraulic gradient of the regional aquifer was inferred from groundwater level data mined from the texas water development board s groundwater database gwdb reports water levels by aquifer 2017 all porewater and groundwater samples for 222rn analysis were collected in 250 ml gas tight borosilicate bottles filled from the bottom and allowed to overflow for one volume before being sealed with no headspace rn 222 measurements were conducted with a durridge rad 7 following the wat250 protocol durridge company inc 2017 within 2 days of sample collection to prevent loss due to decay half life 3 8 days and decay corrected to time of sampling a total of 68 surface water samples were measured for 224ra and 226ra from 9 stations north bay 1 4 7 river 14 15 west bay 8 11 mid bay 12 and ccb 13 and 8 sampling events large volume samples 50 100 l were filtered in the field through a 1 μm and 0 5 μm filter sequence to remove suspended sediments radium was extracted by passing through 15 g of acrylic fibers impregnated with mno2 sun and torgersen 1998 kim et al 2001 dimova et al 2007 these fibers were analyzed for 224ra half life 3 6 days within 3 days of collection on a durridge rad 7 following kim et al 2001 and dimova et al 2007 fibers were then sealed for 21 days to reach secular equilibrium before running for 226ra half life 1600 years on a durridge rad 7 following kim et al 2001 and johnson et al 2008 extraction efficiencies of mn fibers were determined to be 98 for 224ra and 96 for 226ra by processing random samples through a second mn cartridge analytical errors determined from rad 7 counting statistics were 20 for 224ra and 8 for 226ra at the 95 confidence interval 2 3 continuous resistivity profiles electrical resistivity er measurements were conducted using a marine supersting r8 ip resistivity meter advanced geosciences 2016 with a 112 m cable consisting of 56 graphite electrodes spaced 2 m apart which has the capacity to image to a depth of 22 5 m for more detail see murgulet et al 2016 douglas et al 2017 surveys were conducted on calm water with boat speeds 4 km hr 1 to minimize noise gps data and depth soundings were recorded simultaneously within the instrument using a lowrance lms 480 m with an lgc 2000 gps antenna while a ysi professional plus data sonde recorded continuous water column salinity and temperature these field measurements of surface water salinity and thickness of the water column below the electrode array are applied in the inversion to constrain the results so that changes in surface water conditions do not affect the resistivity model results for the sediment underlying the electrode array nyquist et al 2008 bighash and murgulet 2015 the system allows imaging of both the water column and the underlying sediments when the cable is deployed at the water surface two crps were measured in early september 2014 for a preliminary exploration of nueces bay from the river to corpus christi bay and across the north bay fig 1c at the time accessibility was restricted in the river and throughout the bay due to lower than normal water levels during the drought as such the lower nueces river was not surveyed until february 2015 when water levels had risen in the river sampling stations for geochemical sampling were selected from anomalously low or high resistivities appearing in the inverted resistivity images and with consideration for the geologic environments within the bay most selected stations correspond to locations with potential for high sgd but control stations with the least potential for sgd occurrence were also selected an additional survey was conducted in may 2017 focusing on north south transects fig 1c this crp was performed in conjunction with a spatial survey of water quality parameters i e temperature salinity dissolved oxygen do and ph and radon activity see section 2 5 2 4 darcy discharge rate estimates darcy s law estimates of local shallow brackish sgd were derived using water level and hydraulic conductivity data from four groundwater monitoring wells 10 m depth located near the calallen saltwater barrier dam standard slug in tests with the method hvorslev 1951 were conducted at the monitoring wells with a pressure data logger collecting data at 1 hz to estimate horizontal hydraulic conductivity of the shallow aquifer sediments as all four shallow wells were brackish the point water heads were converted to freshwater heads fetter 2001 before hydraulic gradients were determined darcy s law estimates of regional deep freshwater sgd were determined from twdb monitoring wells water level data from 2014 2015 and 2016 only wells less than 245 m 800 ft deep i e chicot aquifer were included in the construction of groundwater elevation contours fig 1b and calculation of hydraulic gradients the chicot aquifer has been found to have average horizontal hydraulic conductivities of 14 2 m d 1 range 9 8 19 2 m d 1 within 121 km of the coast with the highest conductivities x 18 6 m d 1 occurring within 80 km of the coast young et al 2016 a specific yield i e effective porosity of 0 05 for the chicot aquifer young et al 2016 was applied to convert from specific discharge to groundwater velocity 2 5 222rn derived sgd time series 222rn measurements at four locations within the study area fig 1 presented by murgulet et al 2018 are used for spatial analysis and temporal comparison with the darcy and 226ra derived sgd estimates in the current study given the spatial heterogeneity observed in the time series sgd estimates continuous mobile 222rn measurements were conducted in may 2017 surface water 0 5 m below the air water interface was continuously pumped to an air water exchanger rad aqua by a peristaltic pump while a closed air loop continuously pumped the gas through three rad 7 radon detectors connected in parallel the use of multiple detectors connected in parallel yields increased spatial resolution and greater precision constraining spatial heterogeneity of sgd the 222rn activities were integrated every 10 min or one measurement every 660 m at a survey speed of 4 km hr 1 and were used to estimate sgd fluxes following dulaiova et al 2005 and smith and robbins 2012 resulting 222rn activities and crps were mapped in arcgis for visual analysis continuous mobile 222rn measurements were used in a mass balance to estimate sgd as described by dulaiova et al 2005 smith and robbins 2012 murgulet et al 2018 briefly the model accounts for radon sinks atmospheric evasion radioactive decay and mixing with lower activity waters offshore and sources sediment supported 222rn and 226ra supported 222rn over time assigns any further source of radon mass to sgd inputs and converts to sgd fluxes by dividing by the radon activity in the advecting fluid wind speed data were obtained from the conrad blucher institute monitoring station 185 nueces bay the sediment supported 222rn activities and groundwater endmember activities from murgulet et al 2018 were used for the sediment supported 222rn correction and conversion to advective fluxes respectively for the continuous mobile 222rn survey in july 2017 226ra samples 40 50 l collected at high and low tides during a 24 hour stationary monitoring event that month were used to correct for in situ production of 222rn 2 6 ra derived sgd to estimate sgd from 226ra observations we use an estuarine mass balance to determine the excess inventory of 226ra attributed to groundwater flux in the bay this mass balance includes all sources of radium other than groundwater such as tidal exchange rivers and desorption from riverine suspended sediments moore 1996 in this study excess 226ra 226raex dpm d 1 is expressed mathematically as 1 r 226 a ex r 226 a nb r 226 a ccb v nb t w

suspended sediment concentration g m 3 in the river charette et al 2001 swarzenski 2007 after accounting for all possible sources of 226ra it is assumed that the excess activity from eq 1 is the result of sgd thus using 226ra activities from the groundwater wells in the vicinity of nueces bay sgd m3 d 1 is calculated as 2 sgd r 226 a ex r 226 a gw discrete 224ra and 226ra measurements across the bay were used to calculate apparent water mass ages moore 2000 to calculate the apparent radium water mass age or the relative time that has passed since the radium first entered the system tw we used the activity ratios ar of the short lived 224ra to the long lived 226ra 224ra 226ra isotopes johnson et al 2008 3 t w l n ar obs ar gw λ 224 λ 226 where arobs is the activity ratio of the samples of interest argw is the initial groundwater source activity ratio and λ224 and λ226 are the decay constants for 224ra and 226ra respectively this equation assumes 1 surface water ra activities and ars will be lower than the ra source i e groundwater or ra bearing sediments but higher than offshore waters and 2 the ra source is constant with respect to ars knee et al 2011 radium desorption experiments were conducted to determine the activity of 226ra released from riverine suspended sediments upon entering the estuary using representative riverine sediment samples i e 0 10 cm depth in the sediment column from just downstream of the salt water barrier dam near calallen tx sediment samples were collected when the river had been overflowing the dam for a week and salinities approximately 50 m downstream of the dam were 0 78 high salinity bay water 31 1 was collected filtered through whatman gf f filters to remove suspended solids and processed through mno2 fibers to remove dissolved radium known masses of dried sediments 15 mg and 870 mg were added to a volume of radium free filtered bay water 3 l to represent total suspended solid tss concentrations in the study area sample solutions were then stirred and placed on a shaker table for 45 min before extracting the desorbed radium by passing the solution through mno2 fibers and processing as described in section 2 2 total 226ra activity was normalized to the sediment mass and then multiplied by the sediment flux from the river typical tss concentrations in nueces bay range from 5 to 292 mg l 1 nicolau and hill 2013 for the most conservative estimates of radium desorption the experiments were performed for the highest 290 mg l 1 previously observed tss concentrations at salinities of approximately 30 25 20 15 10 and 5 the desorption activities ranged from 1 2 dpm g 1 salinity 30 to 2 3 dpm g 1 salinity 20 the maximum desorption activity corresponding to the salinity of each sampling event was applied to the calculation eq 1 an estimate of total surface inflow to nueces bay serves as the streamflow term qr as the usgs streamflow gauge for nueces river at calallen tx 08211500 being upstream of dams diversions and municipal intakes significantly overestimates river discharge to the bay freshwater surface inflow to nueces bay was retrieved from the twdb s water data for texas coastal freshwater inflow estimates for watersheds 21010 22012 and 20005 shown in fig 1b and c fernando 2017 twdb 2018 the region north of the bay encompasses approximately half of the 20 005 watershed thus half of the inflow estimates for this watershed were applied to the sum of watersheds 21 010 and 22012 table 4 shows the values of each term used for estimating sgd to nueces bay in this study using the 226ra mass balance 3 results and discussion 3 1 continuous resistivity profiles crp 3 1 1 preliminary crps exploratory crps conducted in september 2014 for the northern and southern areas of the bay fig 1c reveal several locations with resistivity anomalies average resistivity for freshwater saturated sediments like clay and sandy loam are typically 38 ω m and 51 ω m respectively nyquist et al 2008 the range of resistivities measured during the crps 0 10 10 ω m is suggestive of sediments saturated with high salinity water murgulet et al 2016 an observation supported by porewater salinities ranging from 23 6 to 40 8 x 32 9 n 26 over the study period vertically elongated features of very low resistance 0 1 0 24 ω m within mostly higher resistance sediments 3 2 10 ω m occurred at stations 1 2 and 4 along the northern transect and station 12 along the southern transect fig 4 a b and e f from crp image interpretation these abrupt small scale anomalies are not consistent with sgd plumes as outside these locations most of the subsurface within the imaged transect does not change significantly and is comprised of more resistant sediments the observed abrupt changes in resistance were found to correspond well with the location of some buried oil and gas pipelines fig 2 the resistivity signature may differ depending on the pipe material i e steel will have lower resistivity the composition of the product within the pipeline and the saturation status i e filled or empty however these types of bottom sediment disturbances such as sediment dredging and infill likely create exchange conduits between aquifers and bay waters by short circuiting confining layers as indicated by these preliminary crps other changes in resistivity that occur across a broader area and are confined to the shallower portions of transects correspond to oyster reefs confirmed by field observations fig 4b c and d e which settle on harder substrates when compared to surrounding softer more conductive sediments twichell et al 2010 and may influence bay chemistry and circulation patterns murgulet et al 2018 the highest resistivities measured in the subsurface were below the navigation channel crossing between nueces and corpus christi bays emplacement of bridge pilings and cutting deep into or removing the underlying low permeability confining sediments through dredging of bottom sediments could facilitate the flow of groundwater to the offshore water column burnett et al 2006 santos et al 2008 such as at stations 13 fig 4e f the lower nueces river is underlain by a few meters of more resistant sediments with increasing thickness toward the bay fig 4g h and h i two sampling stations were selected in this region one upstream where the resistive layer is more continuous station 15 and one in a slightly more heterogeneous resistivity area downstream station 14 laser diffraction sediment grain size analysis shows the percent sand in the sediments decreases downstream from predominantly sand or sand silt clay i e more resistive to clayey silt i e less resistive in the river mouth pena 2017 thus the higher resistivity in the downstream stretch is likely not explained by the difference in sediment types but rather by changes in pore fluid salinity toward a fresher condition station 14 salinity 23 6 31 5 station 15 salinity 38 7 40 7 this difference has implications related not only to different chemistry of sgd inputs to the river and bay but a possible indication of more significant fresher groundwater discharge at locations with higher porewater resistivity 3 1 2 north south crps the north south transects indicate that the middle of the bay is likely characterized by finer sediments and is not underlain by a more resistant layer i e sand as are the northern and southern portions of the bay fig 5 this finding is in agreement with shideler et al 1981 who show that in this portion of the bay sediments are mainly comprised of silt and clay the eastern n s transect close to stations 1 and 12 shows decreasing resistance from n to s in the deeper 10 m deep profile underlying an almost constant low resistivity surface layer to 5 10 m depth during porewater collection at station 12 and periodically at station 11 we observed soft unconsolidated and saturated silty clay to 3 m below sediment water interface this layer may indicate that the integrity of the bottom clay rich layer as a reliable confining unit has been altered favoring vertical advective flow barbour and fredlund 1989 gerla 1992 silliman et al 2002 similar to terrestrial occurrences of quicksand or soap holes toth 1971 the n and s shore transects show vertically elongated anomalies of very low resistivity surrounded by areas of higher resistivity which are believed to correspond to buried pipelines as observed in the preliminary crps see section 3 1 1 the n shore transect contains areas with the highest observed bay resistivity likely reflecting different depositional environments and a higher sand fraction the profile reveals a possible infilled paleovalley spalt et al 2018 a relict fluvial channel incised during a glacial maximum and subsequently

shallow stratigraphic features like paleovalleys are known to modify groundwater discharge to coastal waters and geochemical processes across the sediment water interface sawyer et al 2014 3 2 sgd characterization 3 2 1 groundwater endmember characteristics groundwater salinities were brackish in shallow groundwater salinity 4 0 27 4 x 12 5 n 4 and ranged from fresh to brackish in deep groundwater salinity 0 7 4 0 x 1 6 n 6 in comparison bay porewater was more saline than terrestrial groundwater salinity 25 1 40 8 x 32 9 n 17 throughout the study period average 224ra activities in shallow brackish groundwater samples 650 4 793 6 dpm 100 l 1 x 725 9 dpm 100 l 1 were 2 7 times higher than those in fresher deep groundwater samples 21 0 138 6 dpm 100 l 1 x 61 6 dpm 100 l 1 however average 226ra activities in shallow groundwater 22 9 97 4 dpm 100 l 1 x 69 1 dpm 100 l 1 were slightly lower than in deep groundwater 26 5 238 9 dpm 100 l 1 x 76 9 dpm 100 l 1 the range of groundwater 226ra activities was consistent with those observed in shallow brackish groundwater 8 5 70 3 dpm 100 l 1 by breier and edmonds 2007 however because shallow groundwater was sampled following the recession of the late spring 2015 flood waters these lower 226ra activities could be a result of flushing of the surficial aquifer leading to an insufficient amount of time for the long lived 226ra to regenerate and desorb from the aquifer matrix cerdà domènech et al 2017 consequently shallow groundwater ars 8 2 31 2 x 14 4n 4 were significantly higher than in the deep groundwater 0 4 2 6 x 1 1 n 6

porewater 224ra activity was slightly lower than that in shallow groundwater and 6 fold greater than that in deep groundwater mean porewater 226ra was 1 5 fold greater than both the mean shallow and mean deep groundwater for comparison porewater ars ranged from a minimum of 2 0 in may 2017 similar to the deep groundwater average ar to a maximum of 10 6 in january 2018 a value near that of average shallow groundwater ar the annual average porewater ar x 6 6 is like the average of all groundwater ars x 6 4 this large range in porewater ars and the considerable upward groundwater discharge within the gulf coast aquifer chowdhury and wade 2004 suggest that groundwater flowpaths fluctuate throughout the year and that porewater is likely a mixture of deep and shallow groundwater thus an average ar of all groundwater sampled during our study represents the mean porewater endmember for the current study salinity has been long recognized as an important factor that controls dissolved ra activities moore 1996 boehm et al 2006 as ra is strongly particle reactive at low salinities and becomes more soluble with an increase in salinity and ionic strength of the solution which enhances ion exchange however dissolved oxygen do and ph may also influence ra solubility in groundwater cerdà domènech et al 2017 at do concentrations less than 1 mg l 1 or ph less than 6 ra adsorption to the aquifer matrix has been shown to decrease which facilitates its mobility in groundwater szabo et al 2012a b salinities 5 were observed in all deep groundwater and one shallow groundwater sample

below the minimum activity supported by the sediment 1 6 103 dpm 100 l 1 were deemed compromised due to loss of radon during sampling handling or analysis lambert and burnett 2003 and disregarded from further analysis the average porewater 222rn activity x 24 0 103 dpm 100 l 1 is similar to the lowest deep groundwater and the maximum activity is greater than the shallow groundwater no significant

the porewater in the bay 12 3 103 dpm 100 l 1 this 222rn enrichment in the river porewater may result from less surface water recirculation i e less dilution given the deeper collection points i e 1 5 2 m into the sediment closer proximity to the bank and source of groundwater and or legacy of 226ra sequestered in the sediment from direct discharges of oil field brines into the river fig 1c in the

not observed in the middle of the bay likely reflecting the different sedimentary environments and depositional rates hill and nicolau 2014 oxidation reduction conditions kadko et al 1987 and history

edmonds 2007 breier et al 2010 report elevated 224ra approximately 10 0 120 0 dpm 100 l 1 and 226ra 13 8 112 2 dpm 100 l 1 activities for nueces bay overall 224ra varied by 2 to 4 5 fold while 226ra was more consistent and varied by 1 5 to 2 5 fold during each event the ccb seawater endmember experienced the least variation in both radium activities across the study period 224ra 40 9 73 7 dpm 100 l 1 x 56 3 dpm 100 l 1 226ra 42 8 72 4 dpm 100 l 1 x 48 7 dpm 100 l 1 likely due to the distance from terrestrial ra sources and consistently high salinity 17 2 38 8 at this location the nueces river 224ra and 226ra endmembers varied by 1 6 to 4 5 fold and by 2 1 to 6 2 fold respectively 224ra 20 0 90 2 dpm 100 l 1 x 53 0 dpm 100 l 1 226ra 16 4 101 8 dpm 100 l 1 x 57 3 dpm 100 l 1 with consistently the lowest activities during summer for both isotopes the most significant differences in bay ra activities between sampling periods are closely associated with flooding of the nueces river in summer 2015 table 2 fig 3 within the bay the lowest salinity min 0 2 max 6 5 x 3 3 and ra activities 224ra 21 8 61 2 dpm 100 l 1 x 43 0 dpm 100 l 1 226ra 19 3 36 6 dpm 100 l 1 x 27 9 dpm 100 l 1 occur in summer 2015 as a result of nearly complete flushing of the bay by nueces river floodwaters which first peaked three weeks prior to sample collection followed by lesser peaks 9 days prior to sample collection and one day before subsequent sample collection days fig 3 between spring and summer 2015 sampling salinities decreased from 15 1 to 31 7 x 27 1 to 0 2 6 5 x 2 5 because of these low salinities and flushing of the bay summer 2015 radium activities were lowest in the river and increased with distance from the river mouth consequently ra activities are greater in offshore waters i e ccb so radium isotopes are not suitable tracers of sgd during the summer 2015 sampling event as the assumption of decreasing activities with distance from shore does not hold highest 224ra activities were observed near the nueces river mouth station 8 224ra 21 8 147 0 dpm 100 l 1 x 85 6 dpm 100 l 1 and in close proximity to gum hollow creek in the north bay station 7 224ra 53 0 190 9 dpm 100 l 1 x 106 8 dpm 100 l 1 station 7 had the highest 224ra activity in each season apart from fall and winter 2015 when the river mouth had the highest activity this finding suggests the river and creek are persistent sources of radium to the bay however the 224ra mixing model and results from murgulet et al 2018 indicate minimal riverine influence input across the south bay fig 6 a d and f i except for in fall 2015 fig 6e furthermore during the drought the nueces estuary was hypersaline with mean salinities x 37 0 in fall 2014 and x 35 5 in winter 2014 slightly greater than typical seawater i e 35 and the lower river salinities as high as 15 fig 3b under these conditions maximum desorption from riverine suspended sediments likely occurred near the river mouth as there does not appear to be any riverine influence beyond station 8 fig 6f h thus elevated ra activities across the bay are likely due to inputs from groundwater and bay sediment sources alone rather than riverine inputs ra 224 was elevated in spring 2015 and 2016 compared to all other sampling events particularly at northern stations these increased 224ra activities in spring likely result from increased runoff and shallow groundwater discharge following the onset of the spring rains further supporting the link between the inland hydrologic cycle and sgd recall that shallow groundwater is more enriched in 224ra than 226ra compared to deeper groundwater these findings likely result from decreased contact time of waters with aquifer solids lamontagne et al 2008 changes in redox conditions or chemical characteristics of the aquifer matrix gonneea et al 2008 3 2 2 2 radium activity ratios and radium ages overall 224ra and 226ra activities in surface water do not have a significant correlation r 0 13 p 0 3 however three distinct trends separate samples into two strongly correlated clusters by ars 1 and ars 1 r 0 74 p 0 01 and r 0 78 p 0 01 respectively fig 7 and a riverine mixing line that only occurs in fall 2015 fig 6e these distinct trends suggest that there are likely two or more sources of radium in the study area charette et al 2001 one enriched in 224ra high ar and one deficient in 224ra low ar relative to 226ra charette et al 2001 these sources could reflect more deep groundwater input with its relatively low ars 0 4 2 6 or shallow groundwater with its much higher ars 8 2 31 2 bay ars 1 were observed during fall 2014 fall 2015 and winter 2015 and in the river in summer fall and winter 2015 and summer 2016 these sampling events occur in fall 2014 towards the end of a multi year drought 2011 2015 and 3 6 months after heavy precipitation and flooding fall and winter 2015 following long term droughts groundwater discharge from shallower aquifers is expected to diminish due to reduced recharge and the consequent lowering of the water table meanwhile deeper groundwater discharge may become more significant in the overall bay water budget due to a lag between climatic changes and deeper groundwater systems in addition deeper groundwater gradients may be enhanced as the surface water level is lowered due to large effects of evaporation and almost absent surface runoff inputs following the flooding event although the water table is recovering discharge from the shallow aquifer could potentially be accompanied by deeper formation groundwater input another possible cause of low surface water ars i e 1 could be scavenging of dissolved radium from surface waters and regeneration in the sediments it has been shown that radium may be scavenged during the biogenic formation of barite or opal bishop 1988 krest et al 1999 or through oxidation reduction reactions kadko et al 1987 see section 3 3 remineralized under hypoxic conditions and then could be released into the porewater and bottom waters storage of scavenged radium for just a few days would produce a distinct decrease of short lived 224ra activities compared to the much longer lived 226ra activities over time leading to lower 224ra 226ra activity ratios the ars 1 demonstrate a 224ra deficiency within the bay during fall and winter 2015 3 6 months following the occurrence of hypoxic conditions summer 2015 do 1 43 3 22 mg l 1 within the river and bay which indicates radium scavenging may have occurred additionally hypoxic to anoxic conditions are common in the bay porewater across all seasons 0 32 4 47 mg l 1 x 1 44 mg l 1 n 21 so the scavenging and release cycle may be taking place entirely within the sediment resulting in higher ar shallow groundwater losing a portion of its 224ra and discharging with lower ars we calculated a water mass age from radium ars for each season assuming the following groundwater endmembers 1 average ar of deep groundwater x 1 27 2 average ar of all groundwater x 6 5 and 3 average ar of shallow groundwater x 14 4 table 2 radium ages calculated from the average deep groundwater ar suggest a deep groundwater signature i e 224ra deficient or that geochemical processes occurring within the sediment may influence ars by facilitating a 224ra deficiency bay wide in fall 2 5 8 6 days and winter 2015 0 3 5 0 days and only in certain regions of the bay during other sampling events in contrast radium ages utilizing the shallow groundwater 8 6 21 2 days and the average of all groundwater 4 5 17 2 days suggest shallow groundwater is the dominant source to the bay during most seasons the 224ra deficient signature seen in fall and winter 2015 likely reflects the freshening of the bay sediments which increased sorption of radium to aquifer materials the increase in salinity with time is expected to be accompanied by increased radium desorption and input of 224ra deficient signature due to decay see section 3 3 nevertheless the deep groundwater input should not be ignored in this system recall the gulf coast aquifer is described as a leaky artesian aquifer composed of discontinuous sand silt clay and gravel beds thus the small scale heterogeneities and interconnections between the surficial unconfined aquifer and the deeper confined aquifers are not well constrained and it is likely that source mixing is occurring within the aquifer prior to discharge due to these limited constraints on aquifer heterogeneity and the close agreement with average porewater ars the average groundwater ar radium ages were applied to all stations 3 2 3 sgd rates 3 2 3 1 theoretical groundwater discharge rate estimates regional groundwater elevation data reveal hydraulic gradients toward the lower nueces river and the bay in the north but toward the kingsville drawdown shafer and baker 1973 rettman 1983 chowdhury and wade 2004 uddameri et al 2014 and away from the river and bay in the south fig 1b for this study all shallow groundwater velocities were determined using hydraulic conductivities measured from slug tests performed on four piezometers near the lower nueces river fig 1c measured hydraulic conductivities ranged from 1 21 to 5 8 m d 1 which are an order of magnitude greater than the 0 86 m d 1 reported by capuano and jan 1996 for similar clay and silty clay fluvial deltaic sediments in the upper 7 5 m of the beaumont formation along the texas gulf coast these hydraulic conductivities are 3 4 orders of magnitude greater than would be expected for silts and 5 6 orders of magnitude greater than expected for clays which may be attributable to macroporosity rather than matrix porosity capuano and jan 1996 shallow groundwater levels were measured in october 2015 following the recession of flood waters given that flood waters have pooled at the ground surface in the area with piezometers we expect that these measured water levels are likely more elevated than would be expected during a dry or normal year and would thus represent a maximum estimate for hydraulic gradients and discharge rates for comparison we revisited the piezometers in june 2018 after a moderately wet winter and a very dry spring when conditions reflected more normal conditions freshwater heads were on average 0 79 m greater under wet conditions in the piezometers with higher salinity groundwater n 2 but were similar between the wet and normal conditions in the lower salinity ones n 2 table 3 true groundwater pore velocities vp were estimated as the ratio of specific groundwater discharge rates q to the effective porosity ne an effective porosity of 0 05 for the chicot aquifer young et al 2016 was applied to darcy estimates to convert from specific discharge to groundwater velocity the groundwater seepage velocities ranged from 0 02 7 84 m d 1 during normal conditions and 0 09 8 28 m d 1 during wet conditions 3 2 3 2 radon sgd estimates time series 222rn sgd estimates presented by murgulet et al 2018 show large seasonal and spatial variability with discharge rates that range over 2 orders of magnitude with time and 3 orders of magnitude depending on the groundwater endmember supplementary fig s1 the 2017 continuous mobile 222rn survey supports the occurrence of generally high sgd rates 0 79 1 81 m d 1 throughout the bay fig 5 an increase in 222rn activity from 3 8 to 4 dpm l 1 to 5 1 7 3 dpm l 1 and sgd from 1 16 to 1 24 m d 1 to 1 58 1 69 m d 1 was observed across the north bay in conjunction with the highest resistivities observed in the crp see section 3 1 2 fig 5 other studies that continuously surveyed 222rn along coastal transects and rivers found that 222rn ranged around a low background value swarzenski et al 2006b santos et al 2008 but reached an order of magnitude higher where groundwater inputs were the highest while we did not observe an order of magnitude increase 222rn activities and sgd rates were twofold higher along a portion of the north bay near the highest observed resistivities and near the transitions from finer grain sediments to sandier sediments fig 5 for instance the highest 222rn activities 6 2 7 3 dpm l 1 and sgd rates 1 70 1 81 m d 1 were observed farther from shore near these sediment transition zones from predominantly silty clay mid bay sediments to more silty sand and sandy clay sediments in the north and south bay respectively shideler et al 1981 a lesser increase in 222rn activity 5 5 4 dpm l 1 and sgd rates 1 38 1 43 m d 1 was observed at the silty clay to clayey silt transition along the western most survey line fig 5 though not acting as a barrier to flow see section 3 1 2 these low permeability sediments may redirect some of the groundwater toward the more permeable sediment transition areas mentioned above this survey further confirms the 222rn activity variability and demonstrates that sgd rates may vary by an order of magnitude across the system as also observed with the time series stations murgulet et al 2018 3 2 3 3 radium budget bay wide 226ra derived sgd rates ranged from 2 9 104 m3 d 1 4 10 4 m3 m 2d 1 fall 2015 to 1 2 106 m3 d 1 0 04 m3 m 2d 1 spring 2015 using the average terrestrial groundwater endmember table 4 in contrast applying the average deep terrestrial groundwater endmember to fall and winter 2014 and 2015 seasons results in bay wide sgd rates ranging from 2 3 106 m3 d 1 0 04 m3 m 2d 1 to 8 8 107 m3 d 1 1 2 m3 m 2d 1 respectively these deep sgd rates are 1 2 orders of magnitude greater than those derived with the average terrestrial groundwater while it is unlikely the deeper groundwater is discharging bay wide due to subsurface heterogeneity this study strongly suggests that sources of sgd to nueces bay are from both shallow shorter i e nearby water table aquifer and deeper longer flowpaths i e confined semiconfined aquifers the influence of one groundwater source over the other is likely determined by the impact of local and inland climatic conditions on hydraulic gradients i e drought versus flood conditions disturbance of the bay sediments santos et al 2008 and the clay sediments failing to restrict flow but instead enhancing flow toth 1971 barbour and fredlund 1989 bighash and murgulet 2015 it should be noted that this method could not be applied to calculate a bay wide sgd rate for the summer 2015 flood event when the 226ra activity increased with distance from shore section 3 2 2 and thus violates the necessary assumptions for this model see section 2 6 breier and edmonds 2007 found that 226ra derived sgd rates in nueces bay were 3 1 105 m3 d 1 4 10 3 m3 m 2d 1 in nueces bay which was deemed too high for such a clay rich semi arid environment and in comparison to riverine inflows so the authors attributed this excess 226ra to oil field brine leakage from pipelines throughout the bay the current study found similar 226ra derived sgd rates which we believe to be likely due to groundwater discharge directly to the lower nueces river and the bay in fact even higher sgd fluxes are expected based on the 222rn mass balance murgulet et al 2018 see section 3 2 3 2 any excess 226ra derived from leaking oil field brines is accounted for in the 222rn mass balance as part of the 226ra supported radon step where supported 226ra is subtracted from the total 222rn measurements to calculate an excess 222rn burnett and dulaiova 2003 3 3 sgd intercomparison semi arid regions experience intra annual and inter annual fluctuations between dry and wet periods during wet periods precipitation exceeds evaporation so sgd is expected to be greater nearshore as the surficial aquifer is recharged and the hydraulic gradient increased however during dry periods evaporation far exceeds precipitation so sgd is expected to decline at the shoreline as the hydraulic gradient in the surficial aquifer decreases slowly due to reduced aquifer recharge furthermore sgd away from shore resulting from longer deeper flow paths may increase on a time scale of weeks to months following precipitation events due to a lag time and or as the hydraulic gradient increases due to greater evaporation rates lowering the surface water level more quickly than the water table the 222rn derived sgd fluxes reported here seem high for a semi arid region rebounding from a multi year drought compared to results from other regions and other south texas bays table 5 these 222rn derived sgd fluxes are even greater than those measured in the slightly less disturbed similar semi arid clay rich environments of baffin bay lopez et al 2018 and mission aransas estuary douglas et al 2017 spalt et al 2018 to the north and south respectively of nueces bay during overlapping sampling periods urquidi gaume et al 2016 used radon to investigate sgd in semi arid southeastern la paz bay mexico and found elevated sgd rates 0 10 0 18 m d 1 and nutrient concentrations in winter lagging precipitation by 3 4 months using radium shellenbarger et al 2006 reported higher than expected sgd fluxes ranging from 0 06 to 0 26 m d 1 in arid eilat israel after a 4 year drought and boehm et al 2006 reported 0 06 0 92 m d 1 in semi arid huntington beach california el gamal et al 2012 found low sgd rates 0 02 0 06 m d 1 in both wet and dry seasons in the arid marina lagoon egypt this lack of a seasonal pattern was attributed to either sgd derived from regional aquifers not influenced by recharge from local rainfall or artificial recharge to the surficial aquifer from anthropogenic activities while these studies demonstrate that elevated groundwater discharge occurs in arid and semi arid regions following drought conditions the 222rn derived sgd fluxes shown here and in murgulet et al 2018 exceed these previous investigations by an order of magnitude in some seasons and are more variable the large seasonal and spatial sgd variabilities observed with the time series measurements likely reflect different groundwater inputs i e regional and local responses to hydroclimatic changes i e recharge to the aquifer following rain events and anthropogenic influences i e oil gas activities dredging this is also supported by seasonally variable radium ars which as discussed earlier indicate either the occurrence of deep and shallow groundwater mixing within bay sediments fall and winter 2014 or responses to heavy precipitation events fall and winter 2015 in contrast to 222rn 226ra derived fluxes generally fall below rates from the above mentioned investigations but match the boehm et al 2006 range fairly well for rates calculated with the deeper terrestrial groundwater endmember i e the most conservative sgd estimates however deeper groundwater input as suggested by this current study although likely to occur is not expected to be predominant or the sole source thus next we are evaluating potential factors leading to these discrepancies both between methods of measurements and other areas similar in nature an intercomparison of submarine groundwater discharge estimates using 222rn 226ra and darcy estimates in waquoit bay ma by mulligan and charette 2006 found the difference between the total i e 222rn and fresh terrestrial i e darcy estimates sgd estimates to be in good agreement with the saline recirculated sgd i e 226ra in an unconfined sandy coastal aquifer however in the current study the difference between the average total and fresh terrestrial sgd estimates exceeds the saline recirculated sgd estimates by one or two orders of magnitude in all events possible causes of discrepancy are overestimation of 222rn derived sgd estimates underestimation of the freshwater terrestrial sgd component by darcy calculations or underestimation of the saline sgd component by the 226ra mass balance average 222rn derived sgd from stationary measurements are likely overestimated when scaled bay wide this overestimation may occur because stationary continuous 222rn measurements were performed at locations where sgd was expected based on crp analysis nevertheless the follow up continuous mobile 222rn survey indicates that high 222rn derived sgd 0 79 1 81 m d 1 x 1 36 m d 1 occurs bay wide fig 5 darcy calculations rely on hydraulic gradients and hydraulic conductivities from monitoring wells to the bay but this method is limited by the number of wells with water level data and these calculations do not account for unique geologic features like growth faults that may enhance groundwater discharge studies have identified at least three growth faults that transect nueces bay hammes et al 2004 brown et al 2005 and if these faults are active and extend to the surface within the bay vertical fluid flow may be enhanced along the fault hooper 1991 furthermore anecdotal evidence personal communications with rick hay suggests that growth faults may surface in nueces county in areas of active oil and gas extraction fig 2 incised creeks occur in the approximate locations of two of the identified growth faults north of the bay potentially indicating surfacing of these faults within close proximity to the bay additional geophysical investigations are necessary to determine what role if any growth faults may play in sgd to nueces bay given that porewater throughout the system was always found to be saline we consider other factors that may influence radium activity such as the rock source and reactivity of radium within the sediment all of which can influence the resulting radium ages and 226ra derived sgd epigenetic roll type uranium deposits occur heterogeneously throughout the regional aquifer system and preferentially leach 238u the parent of 226ra over 232th the precursor of 224ra from the aquifer which may then precipitate and concentrate at mineralizing fronts within the aquifer hobday and galloway 1999 consequently dissolved 226ra would be locally concentrated around these uranium deposits while 224ra would not which could contribute to the lower ars we measure in deep groundwater additionally fault zones may distort the ideal roll geometry of mineralization fronts which may lead to syndiagenetic uranium formation the product of circulating semi confined groundwater within sediments subject to extreme variations in eh and ph in shallow reduced or evaporative facies such as lakes ponds and marshes hobday and galloway 1999 consequently more radium may be generated in the shallower aquifers near the growth faults oxidation reduction reactions accompanying early diagenesis of organic matter can greatly influence the chemical nature of estuarine sediments kadko et al 1987 the rate of organic carbon accumulation influences the depth into the sediment where reduction processes occur i e rapid carbon accumulation results in the accumulation of manganese oxides within centimeters of the sediment water interface as sediments accumulate and are buried manganese may be mobilized in sediment porewater where it becomes oxidized and precipitates within the shallow oxic zone thus creating a highly mn rich layer the depth of this layer is principally governed by the balance between downward o2 diffusion and upward mn2 diffusion the discharge of oil field brines between 1920 s until 1993 into nueces bay d unger et al 1996 is an indication that the presence of a mn rich layer may be significant in our study area as manganese is present in many oil field brines collins 1975 manganese oxides are important scavengers of radium and other trace elements in marine environments and the adsorptive properties of the upper sediment column can be significantly altered by the redistribution and concentration of manganese oxides kadko et al 1987 consequently dissolved radium in the upwelling groundwater may be sequestered in the bottom sediments as the water passes through reducing fronts or the mn rich layer in the upper 1 2 m of bay sediments which leads to lower 226ra derived sgd estimates compared to 222rn based estimates further investigation into the redox chemistry and radium activities within the sediment are needed to elucidate the impact of these processes the discharge of oil field brines may have major effects on sgd estimates not only related to the possible scavenging of radium i e the mn rich layer and underestimation of discharge rates but as an unaccounted for source of 222rn and overestimation of discharge rates typical oil field produced waters from the corpus christi area had salinities from 17 5 to 36 3 and 226ra activities from 240 to 3470 dpm 100 l 1 kraemer and reid 1984 given the density of these produced waters they would likely have downwelled into the sediments where depending on the redox conditions organic matter concentrations salinity and temperature the dissolved 226ra and other contaminants may have become sediment bound warner et al 2013 thus potentially contributing to the higher observed 222rn activities and lower dissolved 226ra activities in porewater the greatest density of historic discharge locations occurs around white point in the north western portion of the bay fig 1c which also coincides with the region of greatest hydraulic gradients fig 1b findings here indicate that to select the most appropriate sgd tracer in any given system several factors must be considered tracer enrichment in the groundwater porewater relative to surface water tracer reactivity in the environment and the ability to quantify the sources and sinks of naturally occurring tracers santos et al 2008 as discussed above there are many processes that may influence the activities of dissolved radium within a system whereas 222rn is conservative which simplifies analysis of its sources and sinks on all accounts 222rn appears to be the preferred groundwater tracer in this system 4 conclusions the objectives of this study were to examine the spatial and temporal variability of sgd in a semi arid micro tidal highly anthropogenically disturbed bay dominated by low hydraulic conductivity sediments through the application of several techniques to account for all components of sgd in this study 1 continuous resistivity surveys showed resistivity anomalies that were identified as buried oil gas pipelines and potentially significant groundwater seepage faces in the lower nueces river near the river mouth and in the middle and along the northern shore of nueces bay 2 a crp in conjunction with a continuous 222rn survey highlighted the influence of different lithologies on sgd rates with the greatest sgd rates observed in higher hydraulic conductivity sediments and at transitions from low hydraulic conductivity mid bay sediments to higher hydraulic conductivity north and south bay sediments 3 radium activity ratios reveal useful information for groundwater source identification with surface water ratios following two distinct trends that suggest a high ar shallow groundwater source or a low ar deep groundwater source porewater ar align very well with the average ar of all groundwater an indication that source mixing occurs in the subsurface beneath the bay and 4 226ra derived saline recirculated estimates fall short of 222rn derived total sgd due to inability to account for radium tracer reactivity within the sediment however local darcy fresh terrestrial estimates agree well with the range of 222rn derived sgd estimates likely due to the steeper gradients near shore results of this study indicate that semi arid systems receive significant sgd and that highly anthropogenically disturbed systems may experience sgd from both shallower shorter and deeper longer groundwater flowpaths and potentially lag the climatic conditions by weeks surficial aquifers and months or longer deeper aquifers this study demonstrates the importance of characterizing natural heterogeneities i e sediment type depositional environment growth faults and anthropogenic disturbances i e oil gas drilling dredging oil field brine discharges within a system to improve understanding of spatial and temporal variations in sgd rates this investigation demonstrated that 222rn is the preferred groundwater tracer in nueces bay because it is enriched in groundwater and porewater compared to bay waters and is non reactive compared to radium to further understand the processes controlling radium cycling in this system a detailed study of bay sediment and porewater composition chemistry is necessary to address 1 any legacy radionuclide deposits from historic oil field brine discharges that may not be accounted for in the 222rn mass balance and thus contribute to the high 222rn derived sgd rates 2 the redox conditions within the sediment that influence the cycling of ra in the subsurface and may contribute to changing activity ratios as ra isotopes cycle through adsorption desorption from sediment particles and 3 the depth and thickness of the fe and mn hydr oxide rich layer that may sequester ra from the upwelling groundwater additionally further geophysical investigations i e seismic surveys of the bay are needed to reveal the location s of growth faults throughout the bay where future sgd studies could focus to determine whether the faults contribute to sgd future studies in regions with active oil gas extraction should consider the linkage between anthropogenic disturbances i e oil gas extraction drilling dredging and natural subsurface heterogeneities i e hydroclimatic and hydrogeologic setting growth faults as they could alter groundwater flowpaths and create conduits for deeper groundwater and nutrient inputs via sgd declaration of competing interest the authors
