24670,we propose and study a three stage life cycle model of nemopilema nomurai with a distributed delay to explore the roles of podocyst playing in blooms and the potential strategies for controlling outbreaks of the giant jellyfish our new proposed cpm model is more realistic by considering dormant podocyst the exclusive form of asexual reproduction of n nomurai we investigate the effect of the podocyst production rate and the strobilation rate on the population size and demonstrate the interannual variation of three phases in the dalian sea our study shows that 1 the long term dormancy would result in the cardinal number of podocysts multiplying but no discernible effects on a long time dynamics 2 sensitivity analysis confirms that the recurrence of medusae of n nomurai is most sensitive to the bottom up supplement and the key process of the life cycle is strobilation 3 the effective control strategies are to increase the harvest of ephyrae and to reduce the expansion of substrates keywords giant jellyfish life cycle cpm model podocyst dormancy 1 introduction nemopilema nomurai scyphozoa rhizostomeae is one of the largest jellyfish species in the world ca 2 m maximum bell diameter and 200 kg wet weight kawahara et al 2006 the species mainly distributed at north of 30 n feng et al 2015 which includes the bohai sea the yellow sea the east china sea the seas of japan and korean feng et al 2015 kawahara et al 2006 uye 2008 since 2002 the giant jellyfish nemopilema nomurai has been blooming recurrently almost annually whereas it occurred at about 40 year intervals in the last century kawahara et al 2006 sun et al 2014 uye 2008 the giant jellyfish nemopilema nomurai has an enormous body size and massive aggregations they can cause severe damage to local fisheries and lead to enormous losses for examples they burst nets clog cooling water intakes of coastal power plant and sting swimmers in the yellow sea the average biomass of n nomurai is up to 20446 kg km 2 which accounts for 96 7 8 9 of all large jellyfish and 86 1 24 4 of the total fish catch during august and september 2006 zhang et al 2012 in japan several thousand medusae were trapped almost daily in a set net during october kawahara et al 2006 and monetary loss to fisheries was estimated to be ca 30 billion jpy in 2005 uye 2014 in korean waters for the period 2005 2013 the highest abundance of n nomurai reached 62 4 inds 10 4m 2 in 2005 yoon et al 2014 and the annual direct economic damages amount to 204 6 million for korean fisheries climate changes and environmental changes due to human activities e g overfishing eutrophication species invasions and habitat modification etc are major contributors to jellyfish blooms arai 2001 purcell et al 2007 purcell 2012 richardson et al 2009 uye 2008 in addition mounting evidence indicates that the benthic phases such as podocyst and poly play a critical role in determining the medusa population size in the following season arai 2009 lucas et al 2012 so it is important to study the impact of abiotic and biotic factors on the life cycle of nemopilema nomurai and to reveal the triggering mechanism of the blooms in 2003 kawahara and uye et al obtained polyps of n nomurai by artificial fertilization and induced strobilation by heating the temperature from 13 c to 23 c kawahara et al 2006 in 2006 dong et al attained polyps by natural fertilization and induced strobilation by raising the temperature synchronized with natural waters dong et al 2013 since then the effects of temperature salinity light intensity do sediment and food on the life cycle of n nomurai have been studied dong et al 2013 2015 feng et al 2015 2020 kawahara et al 2006 2013 sun et al 2014 yamamoto et al 2008 like most scyphozoan species nemopilema nomurai has a metagenetic life cycle see fig 1 medusae of nemopilema nomurai release millions of sperm and eggs into the water by sexual reproduction then fertilized eggs develop into free swimming planula larvae the planulae settle and metamorphose into young polyps and then young polyps grow into developed polyps with 16 tentacles on the one hand developed polyps produce podocysts as the only means of asexual reproduction podocysts excyst into small polyps and further develop into fully active polyps that are capable of podocyst production again on the other hand developed polyps elongate and segment into strobilae which pulsate rhythmically and eventually break loose to become ephyrae after ephyrae are released strobilae regress to young polyps and the ephyrae grow rapidly into adult medusae the life cycle is complete different from semaeostomae species such as aurelia aurita or cyanea nozakii kishinouye whose asexual reproduction includes budding stolon budding and podocyst nemopilema nomurai has the exclusive form of asexual reproduction by polyps production of podocysts podocysts have two major ecological roles in the life cycle of n nomurai one is asexual reproduction by which the polyps increase their numbers kawahara et al 2006 and the other is dormancy by which the population can perpetuate for longer periods at least 6 years kawahara et al 2013 once they excyst a lot the polyp abundance might greatly increase ikeda et al 2011 not only that podocyst numbers and percentages increased when temperature and food supply increased sun et al 2014 which is opposite to aurelia aurita and chrysaora quinquecirrha whose podocysts are produced by polyps kept in starvation and high temperature han and uye 2010 thein et al 2012 therefore it is worthy of incorporating podocyst into the model for the life cycle of n nomurai dormancy is not exclusive to scyphozoan some plants with seed banks and some insects with diapauses can be dormant for a long time and there are a lot of models for them mistro et al 2005 for the life cycle models of jellyfish most of them exploit the probabilistic models and statistical analyses to estimate ecophysiological properties marques et al 2015 ramondenc et al 2020 and to discuss the correlations between environmental indices and the process of the life cycle dong et al 2013 2015 feng et al 2015 2020 sun et al 2014 there are also some dynamic models for the life cycle xie et al 2015 propose a general life cycle model for scyphozoa polyp medusa model and verify that expanding substrates have more sensitive impact on the population dynamics however consumption driven growth reproduction and mortality rate are not taken into account henschke et al 2018 develop these contents and draw the conclusions corresponded well with observations in addition goldstein and steiner 2020 present stage structured matrix population models and show that increased food availability can be an important ecological driver of jellyfish outbreaks most of these models focus on the aurelia aurita and few on nemopilema nomurai furthermore all of the above mentioned studies pack up the benthic stages into a single variable p and ignore the forms of asexual reproduction podocyst of n nomurai a single form of asexual reproduction may influence medusa population sizes kawahara et al 2013 and must be included as an additional component c what roles do the dormant podocysts of nemopilema nomurai play in population dynamics of the excystment and the other processes in the life cycle which one is the key process and which can trigger the outbreaks of n nomurai can we hunt for some control methods theoretically compared with a general scyphozoa model pm model what is special about the model of n nomurai all these questions are very important to be well answered motivated by the above consideration we formulate an integro differential model with infinite distributed delay and characterize the dynamics of the life cycle of n nomurai in the coming section based on the fact the surface temperature of the dalian sea changes periodically with time we elucidate the effects of the life cycle processes on the system in section 3 by the sensitivity analysis we explore the strategies to control the population of nemopilema nomurai in section 4 all mathematical analyses and proofs are shown in appendices 2 model in this section we start with a pm model framework by considering the life cycle of nemopilema nomurai and tracking the rates of change for podocyst polyp and medusa 2 1 pm model framework the following pm model a general model for the life cycle of scyphozoa was first proposed by xie et al 2015 1 p m d p d t α t p s 1 γ m d 1 p d 2 p b 1 p 2 d m d t s 2 β t n p d 3 m d 4 m b 2 m 2 where p t and m t are the number of polyps and medusae at time t respectively xie et al 2015 focus on the abundance but not on the somatic growth or morphological change the planulae are considered as polyp larvae and the ephyrae are incipient medusa after liberating strobilae regress into young polyps and the number of polyps does not change the difference between planulae and polyps or ephyrae and medusae in quantity is adjusted by a coefficient namely survival rate all the asexual reproductions such as podocyst budding and stolon are integrated into the polyp hence the life cycle of scyphozoa is simplified into two stages benthic polyp and pelagic medusa note that the podocyst can be dormant for a long time and does not grow directly into polyp it is inappropriate to include podocyst in the polyp we will separate podocysts from the benthic stages as an independent variable to study the life cycle of nemopilema nomurai 2 2 model formulation in order to reveal the roles of dormant podocysts in population dynamics we incorporate podocyst to the pm model as fig 2 shows and assume that all the podocysts can metamorphose into polyps after excysting moreover we assume that the food is enough for the growth of nemopilema nomurai at any stage and any process of the life cycle is accomplished without prey restriction first of all we consider the dynamics of podocysts c the supplement of podocysts comes from asexual reproduction by polyps α p as for the decrease in podocysts studies confirm that the excystment numbers are different between 12 20 month old podocysts and less than 4 months old see fig 3 and they are capable of long dormancy kawahara et al 2013 therefore the number of podocysts is able to accumulate over several years arai 2009 we consider the accumulative effect of the long term dormancy on excystment of podocysts into polyps and characterize it with distributed delay note that the structure of podocyst is an effective deterrent against predation arai 2009 hence the mortality of podocysts would be ignored and the integro differential equation is 2 d c d t α p asexual reproduction by polyps 0 f τ c t τ d τ excystment of podocysts where α is the podocyst production rate and f t is the probability density of podocysts excystment over time which has at least up to the second moment finite namely 0 f τ d τ 1 and 0 τ k f τ d τ k 1 2 and t 0 τ f τ d τ is the average excystment period the increment of polyps is due to recruitment from planulae by sexual reproduction s 1 γ m and from podocysts by excystment the decrement is due to intraspecific competition for substrates b 1 p 2 and to the mortality d 1 p the mortality includes being covered by silt consumed by nudibranch and so on we reach the following equation of polyp 3 d p d t s 1 γ m sexual reproduction 0 f τ c t τ d τ replenishment by excystment d 1 p loss due to death b 1 p 2 loss due to competition where s 1 is the survival and successful settlement rate of planula γ is the sexual reproduction rate d 1 is mortality rate of the polyp and b 1 is intraspecific competition for space the change of medusae allows for the recruitment of ephyrae via strobilation s 2 β n p natural death and predation by other species d 2 m and intraspecific competition b 2 m 2 the equation of medusa is 4 d m d t s 2 β n p replenishment by strobilation d 2 m loss due to death b 2 m 2 loss due to competition where s 2 is the survival rate of ephyra β is the strobilation rate n is the strobilation times d 2 is mortality rate and b 2 is intraspecific competition between medusae for the sake of simplicity we assume the delay kernel f t has the form of exponential distribution on the one hand kawahara et al 2013 indicate that the excystment rate declines or remains constant with the increase of dormancy time see fig 3 on the other hand if the equilibrium c p m of eqs 2 4 exists then the steady state is independent of f t by direct calculation hence with figure 2 28 in dong et al 2013 we have f t 0 t 15 c θ e θ t t 15 c where θ is the average excystment rate in summary we obtain the following podocyst polyp medusa system cpm 5 c p m d c d t α p 0 θ e θ τ c t τ d τ d p d t s 1 γ m 0 θ e θ τ c t τ d τ d 1 p b 1 p 2 d m d t s 2 β n p d 2 m b 2 m 2 where d i b i and n are positive i 1 2 and the other parameters are nonnegative all the parameters are listed in table 1 the initial conditions of system 5 are given by c τ ϕ 1 τ p τ ϕ 2 τ m τ ϕ 3 τ τ 0 where ϕ i is nonnegative continuous and bounded functions i 1 2 3 let ϕ 1 0 c 0 0 ϕ 2 0 p 0 0 ϕ 3 0 m 0 0 recall the assumptions of pm model since podocysts also occupy the benthic substrates if we neglect the change of morphology and regard podocysts as the little polyps that is to say c is just p and the excystment period is zero then the cpm system 5 degenerates into the pm system 1 2 3 model dynamics in this section we analyse the rich dynamic characteristics of the system 5 note that 0 θ e θ τ c t τ d τ t θ e θ t s c s d s let x t t θ e θ t s c s d s by the linear chain trick macdonald 1978 kuang 1993 system 5 with distributed delay is equivalently transformed into 6 c α p x p s 1 γ m x d 1 p b 1 p 2 m s 2 β n p d 2 m b 2 m 2 x θ c θ x let r 0 α d 2 s 1 s 2 β γ n d 1 d 2 and l d 1 r 0 1 b 1 then ω 4 c p m x r 4 0 c α l 0 p l 0 m s 2 β n l d 2 0 x α l is positively invariant set with respect to 6 the extinction equilibrium e 0 always exists and is globally asymptotically stable gas if r 0 1 the unique positive equilibrium e α p p m α p exists if and only if all parameters are positive and r 0 1 let u d 1 2 b 1 p v d 2 2 b 2 m if u v s 1 s 2 β γ n α v 0 then e is locally asymptotically stable las see appendix a for details of the proof 3 effect of the processes in the life cycle on system 5 in this section we want to explore the role of the podocysts playing in population dynamics and to characterize which processes are responsible for proliferation of nemopilema nomurai 3 1 effect of excystment in order to investigate the role of long term dormant podocysts playing in population dynamics we start with θ 0 namely no occurrence of excystment then cpm system 5 degenerates into the following cpm 0 equation 7 c p m 0 c α p p s 1 γ m d 1 p b 1 p 2 m s 2 β n p d 2 m b 2 m 2 it is trivial to show that the positive half axis of c axis is singular line that is every point on this line i e with p 0 is an equilibrium it seems difficult to qualitatively analyse eq 7 by the traditional linearized method fortunately there is an alternative approach brauer et al 2012 that enables us to find their final size and analyse the asymptotic properties see appendix b for details of the proof our theoretical analysis theorem b2 and numerical simulation fig 4 a and b show that the existence of sexual reproduction and asexual reproduction still ensures the pm system is sustainable even though the podocysts maintain dormancy for long periods that is there is no supplement from podocyst to polyp if the excystment rate θ is zero while the podocyst production rate α is not zero then the number of podocysts would tend to the upper bound s ˆ c ˆ 0 0 corresponding to each initial value with r 1 1 if θ 0 and r 1 1 the number of podocysts will increase even tend towards infinity while the polyp and the medusa maintain at positive values s c p m just like those are shown in fig 4 b that means the long periods of dormancy would result in a cardinal number of podocyst multiplying but would not affect the size of polyp and medusa the accumulation of podocysts can form a huge pool once a suitable environment brings θ 0 then polyps would acquire a lot of supplements and stored energy would be transferred from podocysts to polyps even to medusae the system would attain new equilibrium which does not vary with the change of θ fig 4 c and d since the equilibria of eqs 2 4 are independent of f t naturally the steady state is independent to θ furthermore the initial values are 10 50 10 10 in c which are different with d 100 100 100 100 perhaps no matter how long the podocysts sleep and how high the population reaches the stability of the positive equilibrium does not depend on the initial values hence the dormancy or excystment of podocysts has no effect on the system 5 for a long time but the possibility of n nomurai blooms could not be ruled out in short time 3 2 effect of podocyst production and strobilation with changing temperature next we discuss the effect of other two asexual reproduction processes i e the podocyst production and the strobilation which vary with temperature taking the dalian sea as an example we discuss the inter annual variation of temperature over time and study the short term dynamics of the cpm system we have the following nonautonomous analogue of 5 8 d c d t α t p 0 θ e θ τ c t τ d τ d p d t s 1 γ m 0 θ e θ τ c t τ d τ d 1 p b 1 p 2 d m d t s 2 β t n p d 2 m b 2 m 2 where α and β are the functions of temperature varying with time periodically written as α t and β t transform 8 like 5 we have the following equation 9 c α t p x p s 1 γ m x d 1 p b 1 p 2 m s 2 β t n p d 2 m b 2 m 2 x θ c θ x first we give a function fitting to the data of temperature over time fig 5 is the surface temperature of the dalian sea the data blue dots come from the department of natural resources of liaoning province and the date is about 800 days from feb 2 2014 to apr 19 2016 the fourier function of the red fitting curve is 10 t 12 83 8 531 c o s 0 01761 t 3 651 s i n 0 01761 t consider that β varies with changing temperature fig 6 a is the fitting curve of β t and the stars are the data which come from feng et al 2015 where the polyps of nemopilema nomurai were kept in two durations at low temperature of 5 c 40 days or 117 days before experimentations refer to the surface temperature in dalian where there are 49 days in 2015 or 78 days in 2016 below 5 c so with the data of β we choose the mean of the two experiments and polyps were fed once every 5 days the fitting curve represents 11 β t 0 t d 1 34 68 t 2 22 3 t 143 4 t d 1 where d 1 t 3 6 c t 22 c since the optimum temperature for strobilation by n nomurai polyps is 10 13 c feng et al 2015 which is corresponding to the dalian sea in mid may to early june and in november we can see that there are two peaks in b when the strobilation rate reaches the peak the ephyrae are released with maximum quantity since we regard ephyrae as incipient medusae the number of medusae also reaches its peak at the same time see fig 6 d it is incredible but we could not rule it out after all n nomurai can be found in november and december zhang et al 2012 in fact hernroth and gröndahl 1985 show that the ephyrae are released mainly in october and november then they rapidly descend to deeper water and settle down there overwinter fig 6 c shows that the three phases increase with β increasing affected by surface temperature of the dalian sea the function of α t with respect to temperature is given by dong et al 2013 which is standardized as follows 12 α t 0 t d 2 0 0182 t 2 0 1709 t 0 1297 40 t d 2 where d 2 t 7 5 c t 30 c fig 7 a shows that the size of podocysts increases with α increasing if we consider α as a function of temperature which varies periodically the pink of podocysts occurs at the hottest august about 200th day while the effect of α on polyps is very little and on medusae is almost to zero with eqs 10 12 we draw the change of the three phases with respect to temperature and time c and d demonstrate that the number of podocysts increases with temperature raising and reaches the peak at the same time with b which is not changed with the addition of β t except for a very small change in quantity compared with b the number of polyps and medusae in c and d has a distinct change by considering β t in which polyps and medusae reach their peaks at about 11 c mid may and november which is almost like fig 6 d from figs 6 and 7 we can conclude that the recurrence of medusae of nemopilema nomurai is mostly dependent on strobilation and the size of podocysts is mostly dependent on podocyst production rate they are all affected by periodically varying temperature in order to show how the system is dependent on the strobilation rate we present the following sensitivity analysis 4 sensitivity analysis and control strategies 4 1 local sensitivity analysis 6 referring to the formulas for the sensitivity indices s i in kong et al 2014 we compute the s i of the steady state with respect to the parameters of the system 6 and list them in table 2 the quantity of s i describes the strength of sensitivity of the steady state to the parameters while the sign indicates the positive or negative relationship with the parameters table 2 shows that the steady state of podocysts has the largest sensitivity indices to the podocyst production rate α which is consistent with fig 7 the stable size of polyps has the strongest relationship with intraspecific competition b 1 a negative relationship means polyps will stabilize at a higher level with lower b 1 which can be demonstrated in the following subsection the steady state of medusae is most sensitive to the effective supplement from bottom to top β s 2 n furthermore the steady states of both the polyps and medusae are more sensitive to the strobilation rate β than to the podocyst production rate α which verifies the conclusion of figs 6 and 7 in fact if there is no supplement from polyps to podocysts but the other processes exist then the number of podocysts tends to zero and the relationship of polyp medusa is not affected see theorem a5 the other sensitivity indices to the parameters can be found in table 2 sensitivity analysis provides the directions for control strategies 4 2 control strategies of system 5 in this section we investigate the strategies for controlling the size of medusae since the effect of the podocyst production rate α on medusa is very weak we will discuss other processes and factors from the sensitivity analysis controlling the supplement from the benthic to the pelagic is one of the most direct methods to control β fig 6 a shows that higher or lower temperature will bring it down to lessen s 2 we can increase the capture effort or raise the population size of predator cutting down the strobilation rate and the survival rate of ephyra have almost the same control effect the same s i with different control methods fig 6 c shows that the population sizes reduce with the decrease of β if we do that thoroughly in the ideal case what will happen let s 2 β n 0 and r 0 1 then e 2 α α d 1 b 1 α d 1 b 1 0 α α d 1 b 1 exists and is las theorem a6 and corollary a7 then medusae disappear and the control is effective in theory to control the intraspecific competition of medusae b 2 is also a choice s i 0 6623 in fact the intraguild predation is very common amongst jellyfish titelman et al 2007 even including the giant jellyfish nemopilema nomurai which can be preyed by cyanea nozakii wang et al 2020 however if c nozakii is introduced maybe it will bring new unexpected disasters hence it is not recommended to control the size of medusae by increasing b 2 next we will discuss the control of the supplement from the pelagic to the benthic which is determined by the sexual reproduction rate γ and the survival rate of planula s 1 studies indicate that the gonadal maturation of n nomurai is induced when the medusae are fatally damaged uye 2014 in other words when we try to control n nomurai by killing medusae we just help them to spawn and millions of eggs and sperm are released into the water feng et al 2015 after they combine metamorphose and settle down a new life cycle begins hence γ is not considered in our control strategies if we want to prevent the supplement from the pelagic to the benthic the method is to control the survival rate of planula e g by capturing fig 8 a shows that the population size reduces with the decreasing of s 1 if s 1 decreases to zero then an interior equilibrium e 2 exists and the number of every stage is inversely proportional to b 1 see theorem a11 for details that means even if we can control the top down supplement completely the population size is going to rise with the decreases of b 1 and the control is invalid see fig 8 c fig 8 b c demonstrate that if b 1 increases then the population size decreases furthermore for a bigger s 1 the number of medusae will decrease sharply with the increase in b 1 hence increasing b 1 fig 8 b or increasing b 1 and reducing s 1 fig 8 c are all the effective control strategies finally we discuss the control of the top down and bottom up supplement simultaneously fig 8 d demonstrates that the number of medusae will decline distinctly with the decreasing of s 1 and β that means the strategy is effective the mathematical theorems and the detailed proofs of this section are listed in appendix a all theoretical findings are summarized in table 3 5 conclusion and discussion we formulate a three stage life cycle model for nemopilema nomurai with distributed delay the emphasis is focused on what the roles of podocysts play in the life cycle in addition based on the surface temperature of the dalian sea we discuss the impact of podocyst production rate and strobilation rate on the size of the population theoretical analyses reveal some mechanisms driving the variation of population and sensitivity analysis provides the directions for control strategies theoretical analyses show that whether the excystment exists or not it only affects the number of podocysts but not the polyps or medusae in the long run if θ 0 then the number of podocysts can stabilize at some positive constant or go to zero if podocysts maintain dormancy for a long time that is θ 0 then the number of podocysts can stabilize at its initial value or maximum including infinity we conclude that the dormant podocysts have no discernible effect on the system 5 for a long time but its impacts on blooms in short periods of time cannot be ruled out numerical simulations and sensitivity analysis verify that the recurrence of medusae of n nomurai is dependent mostly on the bottom up supplement s 2 β n which is identified as the key process in the life cycle on the bloom of n nomurai with the help of sensitivity analysis we discuss the control strategies for medusa some of them are hard to accomplish or invalid such as reducing β by shifting ocean temperature introducing cyanea nozakii to prey on n nomurai as well as enhancing the harvest of planulae but overlooking the expansion of substrates meanwhile the effective control strategies are to increase the catch of ephyrae and reduce the expansion of substrates namely decrease the supplement from the benthic to the pelagic and prompt the intraspecific competition of polyps if one wants to control the survival of planula it will be effective by coupling the top down supplement s 1 with the first two methods that is decrease both s 1 and s 2 or decrease s 1 and increase b 1 simultaneously in brief it is most effective to control annual jellyfish outbreaks by cutting down the survival of ephyrae more attention should be paid to reducing the sprawl of artificial substrates in the long run compared cpm system and pm system in xie et al 2015 they have some similar results for polyp and medusa in theory for example polyp and medusa have the same ranges in the positively invariant set the existence conditions of extinct equilibrium e 0 boundary equilibrium e 2 s 2 β n 0 and positive equilibrium e are identical but the conditions of stability are different and it is difficult to prove the globally asymptotically stable for cpm system in addition they all show that the stable size of polyps is sensitive to intraspecific competition of polyps b 1 meanwhile it is worth mentioning that cpm system 5 and its nonautonomous version 8 are more complicated than pm system in xie et al 2015 especially in the cases that θ 0 and β changes annually the former points out that the number of podocysts would increase to infinity with the polyps existing and the number of podocysts reaches the maximum when the polyps die out in other words it depicts the accumulation process of jellyfish in the seabed the latter demonstrates the annual variation of population which has a more realistic significance than the pm system in conclusion the accumulating podocysts by long term dormancy have no discernible effect on the system for a long time the size of medusae of n nomurai is sensitive to the bottom up supplement and the strobilation is identified as the key process of the life cycle for the blooms of n nomurai controlling the bottom up supplement and reducing substrate expansion are all the effective control methods in addition to the above there are some problems worth discussing further it has been verified that the strobilation is the key process and to cut down β is the most important method to control the blooms of n nomurai here we only focus on the effect of temperature on strobilation more abiotic factors should be considered to control the outbreaks of medusae furthermore a higher strobilation rate of n nomurai appears at higher food supply level and no second strobilation occurs in unfed treatments feng et al 2015 therefore food supply should be considered as a biotic factor but not as general assumption the optimum temperature range is 10 to 13 c for strobilation feng et al 2015 which is corresponding to spring and early winter of the dalian sea it is helpful to cut off the second peak of medusa in early winter by getting the relationship between the survival rate of ephyra and temperature or the relationship with other factors medusa is also most sensitive to s 2 both sensitivity analysis and numerical simulation show that the intra specific competition among polyps has an important impact on population for the long run note that podocysts also occupy the space of substrate it is incredible that the accumulation of podocysts by dormancy has no influence on the population maybe the reason is that the competition between polyps and podocysts for space is not considered in our model which will be more significant for studying the influence of podocyst on nemopilema nomurai blooms at last fig 4 depicts that steady states are independent on their initial values we conjecture that the positive equilibrium e is globally asymptotically stable credit authorship contribution statement congbo xie conceptualization methodology software validation formal analysis data curation writing original

24670,we propose and study a three stage life cycle model of nemopilema nomurai with a distributed delay to explore the roles of podocyst playing in blooms and the potential strategies for controlling outbreaks of the giant jellyfish our new proposed cpm model is more realistic by considering dormant podocyst the exclusive form of asexual reproduction of n nomurai we investigate the effect of the podocyst production rate and the strobilation rate on the population size and demonstrate the interannual variation of three phases in the dalian sea our study shows that 1 the long term dormancy would result in the cardinal number of podocysts multiplying but no discernible effects on a long time dynamics 2 sensitivity analysis confirms that the recurrence of medusae of n nomurai is most sensitive to the bottom up supplement and the key process of the life cycle is strobilation 3 the effective control strategies are to increase the harvest of ephyrae and to reduce the expansion of substrates keywords giant jellyfish life cycle cpm model podocyst dormancy 1 introduction nemopilema nomurai scyphozoa rhizostomeae is one of the largest jellyfish species in the world ca 2 m maximum bell diameter and 200 kg wet weight kawahara et al 2006 the species mainly distributed at north of 30 n feng et al 2015 which includes the bohai sea the yellow sea the east china sea the seas of japan and korean feng et al 2015 kawahara et al 2006 uye 2008 since 2002 the giant jellyfish nemopilema nomurai has been blooming recurrently almost annually whereas it occurred at about 40 year intervals in the last century kawahara et al 2006 sun et al 2014 uye 2008 the giant jellyfish nemopilema nomurai has an enormous body size and massive aggregations they can cause severe damage to local fisheries and lead to enormous losses for examples they burst nets clog cooling water intakes of coastal power plant and sting swimmers in the yellow sea the average biomass of n nomurai is up to 20446 kg km 2 which accounts for 96 7 8 9 of all large jellyfish and 86 1 24 4 of the total fish catch during august and september 2006 zhang et al 2012 in japan several thousand medusae were trapped almost daily in a set net during october kawahara et al 2006 and monetary loss to fisheries was estimated to be ca 30 billion jpy in 2005 uye 2014 in korean waters for the period 2005 2013 the highest abundance of n nomurai reached 62 4 inds 10 4m 2 in 2005 yoon et al 2014 and the annual direct economic damages amount to 204 6 million for korean fisheries climate changes and environmental changes due to human activities e g overfishing eutrophication species invasions and habitat modification etc are major contributors to jellyfish blooms arai 2001 purcell et al 2007 purcell 2012 richardson et al 2009 uye 2008 in addition mounting evidence indicates that the benthic phases such as podocyst and poly play a critical role in determining the medusa population size in the following season arai 2009 lucas et al 2012 so it is important to study the impact of abiotic and biotic factors on the life cycle of nemopilema nomurai and to reveal the triggering mechanism of the blooms in 2003 kawahara and uye et al obtained polyps of n nomurai by artificial fertilization and induced strobilation by heating the temperature from 13 c to 23 c kawahara et al 2006 in 2006 dong et al attained polyps by natural fertilization and induced strobilation by raising the temperature synchronized with natural waters dong et al 2013 since then the effects of temperature salinity light intensity do sediment and food on the life cycle of n nomurai have been studied dong et al 2013 2015 feng et al 2015 2020 kawahara et al 2006 2013 sun et al 2014 yamamoto et al 2008 like most scyphozoan species nemopilema nomurai has a metagenetic life cycle see fig 1 medusae of nemopilema nomurai release millions of sperm and eggs into the water by sexual reproduction then fertilized eggs develop into free swimming planula larvae the planulae settle and metamorphose into young polyps and then young polyps grow into developed polyps with 16 tentacles on the one hand developed polyps produce podocysts as the only means of asexual reproduction podocysts excyst into small polyps and further develop into fully active polyps that are capable of podocyst production again on the other hand developed polyps elongate and segment into strobilae which pulsate rhythmically and eventually break loose to become ephyrae after ephyrae are released strobilae regress to young polyps and the ephyrae grow rapidly into adult medusae the life cycle is complete different from semaeostomae species such as aurelia aurita or cyanea nozakii kishinouye whose asexual reproduction includes budding stolon budding and podocyst nemopilema nomurai has the exclusive form of asexual reproduction by polyps production of podocysts podocysts have two major ecological roles in the life cycle of n nomurai one is asexual reproduction by which the polyps increase their numbers kawahara et al 2006 and the other is dormancy by which the population can perpetuate for longer periods at least 6 years kawahara et al 2013 once they excyst a lot the polyp abundance might greatly increase ikeda et al 2011 not only that podocyst numbers and percentages increased when temperature and food supply increased sun et al 2014 which is opposite to aurelia aurita and chrysaora quinquecirrha whose podocysts are produced by polyps kept in starvation and high temperature han and uye 2010 thein et al 2012 therefore it is worthy of incorporating podocyst into the model for the life cycle of n nomurai dormancy is not exclusive to scyphozoan some plants with seed banks and some insects with diapauses can be dormant for a long time and there are a lot of models for them mistro et al 2005 for the life cycle models of jellyfish most of them exploit the probabilistic models and statistical analyses to estimate ecophysiological properties marques et al 2015 ramondenc et al 2020 and to discuss the correlations between environmental indices and the process of the life cycle dong et al 2013 2015 feng et al 2015 2020 sun et al 2014 there are also some dynamic models for the life cycle xie et al 2015 propose a general life cycle model for scyphozoa polyp medusa model and verify that expanding substrates have more sensitive impact on the population dynamics however consumption driven growth reproduction and mortality rate are not taken into account henschke et al 2018 develop these contents and draw the conclusions corresponded well with observations in addition goldstein and steiner 2020 present stage structured matrix population models and show that increased food availability can be an important ecological driver of jellyfish outbreaks most of these models focus on the aurelia aurita and few on nemopilema nomurai furthermore all of the above mentioned studies pack up the benthic stages into a single variable p and ignore the forms of asexual reproduction podocyst of n nomurai a single form of asexual reproduction may influence medusa population sizes kawahara et al 2013 and must be included as an additional component c what roles do the dormant podocysts of nemopilema nomurai play in population dynamics of the excystment and the other processes in the life cycle which one is the key process and which can trigger the outbreaks of n nomurai can we hunt for some control methods theoretically compared with a general scyphozoa model pm model what is special about the model of n nomurai all these questions are very important to be well answered motivated by the above consideration we formulate an integro differential model with infinite distributed delay and characterize the dynamics of the life cycle of n nomurai in the coming section based on the fact the surface temperature of the dalian sea changes periodically with time we elucidate the effects of the life cycle processes on the system in section 3 by the sensitivity analysis we explore the strategies to control the population of nemopilema nomurai in section 4 all mathematical analyses and proofs are shown in appendices 2 model in this section we start with a pm model framework by considering the life cycle of nemopilema nomurai and tracking the rates of change for podocyst polyp and medusa 2 1 pm model framework the following pm model a general model for the life cycle of scyphozoa was first proposed by xie et al 2015 1 p m d p d t α t p s 1 γ m d 1 p d 2 p b 1 p 2 d m d t s 2 β t n p d 3 m d 4 m b 2 m 2 where p t and m t are the number of polyps and medusae at time t respectively xie et al 2015 focus on the abundance but not on the somatic growth or morphological change the planulae are considered as polyp larvae and the ephyrae are incipient medusa after liberating strobilae regress into young polyps and the number of polyps does not change the difference between planulae and polyps or ephyrae and medusae in quantity is adjusted by a coefficient namely survival rate all the asexual reproductions such as podocyst budding and stolon are integrated into the polyp hence the life cycle of scyphozoa is simplified into two stages benthic polyp and pelagic medusa note that the podocyst can be dormant for a long time and does not grow directly into polyp it is inappropriate to include podocyst in the polyp we will separate podocysts from the benthic stages as an independent variable to study the life cycle of nemopilema nomurai 2 2 model formulation in order to reveal the roles of dormant podocysts in population dynamics we incorporate podocyst to the pm model as fig 2 shows and assume that all the podocysts can metamorphose into polyps after excysting moreover we assume that the food is enough for the growth of nemopilema nomurai at any stage and any process of the life cycle is accomplished without prey restriction first of all we consider the dynamics of podocysts c the supplement of podocysts comes from asexual reproduction by polyps α p as for the decrease in podocysts studies confirm that the excystment numbers are different between 12 20 month old podocysts and less than 4 months old see fig 3 and they are capable of long dormancy kawahara et al 2013 therefore the number of podocysts is able to accumulate over several years arai 2009 we consider the accumulative effect of the long term dormancy on excystment of podocysts into polyps and characterize it with distributed delay note that the structure of podocyst is an effective deterrent against predation arai 2009 hence the mortality of podocysts would be ignored and the integro differential equation is 2 d c d t α p asexual reproduction by polyps 0 f τ c t τ d τ excystment of podocysts where α is the podocyst production rate and f t is the probability density of podocysts excystment over time which has at least up to the second moment finite namely 0 f τ d τ 1 and 0 τ k f τ d τ k 1 2 and t 0 τ f τ d τ is the average excystment period the increment of polyps is due to recruitment from planulae by sexual reproduction s 1 γ m and from podocysts by excystment the decrement is due to intraspecific competition for substrates b 1 p 2 and to the mortality d 1 p the mortality includes being covered by silt consumed by nudibranch and so on we reach the following equation of polyp 3 d p d t s 1 γ m sexual reproduction 0 f τ c t τ d τ replenishment by excystment d 1 p loss due to death b 1 p 2 loss due to competition where s 1 is the survival and successful settlement rate of planula γ is the sexual reproduction rate d 1 is mortality rate of the polyp and b 1 is intraspecific competition for space the change of medusae allows for the recruitment of ephyrae via strobilation s 2 β n p natural death and predation by other species d 2 m and intraspecific competition b 2 m 2 the equation of medusa is 4 d m d t s 2 β n p replenishment by strobilation d 2 m loss due to death b 2 m 2 loss due to competition where s 2 is the survival rate of ephyra β is the strobilation rate n is the strobilation times d 2 is mortality rate and b 2 is intraspecific competition between medusae for the sake of simplicity we assume the delay kernel f t has the form of exponential distribution on the one hand kawahara et al 2013 indicate that the excystment rate declines or remains constant with the increase of dormancy time see fig 3 on the other hand if the equilibrium c p m of eqs 2 4 exists then the steady state is independent of f t by direct calculation hence with figure 2 28 in dong et al 2013 we have f t 0 t 15 c θ e θ t t 15 c where θ is the average excystment rate in summary we obtain the following podocyst polyp medusa system cpm 5 c p m d c d t α p 0 θ e θ τ c t τ d τ d p d t s 1 γ m 0 θ e θ τ c t τ d τ d 1 p b 1 p 2 d m d t s 2 β n p d 2 m b 2 m 2 where d i b i and n are positive i 1 2 and the other parameters are nonnegative all the parameters are listed in table 1 the initial conditions of system 5 are given by c τ ϕ 1 τ p τ ϕ 2 τ m τ ϕ 3 τ τ 0 where ϕ i is nonnegative continuous and bounded functions i 1 2 3 let ϕ 1 0 c 0 0 ϕ 2 0 p 0 0 ϕ 3 0 m 0 0 recall the assumptions of pm model since podocysts also occupy the benthic substrates if we neglect the change of morphology and regard podocysts as the little polyps that is to say c is just p and the excystment period is zero then the cpm system 5 degenerates into the pm system 1 2 3 model dynamics in this section we analyse the rich dynamic characteristics of the system 5 note that 0 θ e θ τ c t τ d τ t θ e θ t s c s d s let x t t θ e θ t s c s d s by the linear chain trick macdonald 1978 kuang 1993 system 5 with distributed delay is equivalently transformed into 6 c α p x p s 1 γ m x d 1 p b

r 0 1 let u d 1 2 b 1 p v d 2 2 b 2 m if u v s 1 s 2 β γ n α v 0 then e is locally asymptotically stable las see appendix a for details of the proof 3 effect of the processes in the life cycle on system 5 in this section we want to explore the role of the podocysts playing in population dynamics and to characterize which processes are responsible for proliferation of nemopilema nomurai 3 1 effect of excystment in order to investigate the role of long term dormant podocysts playing in population dynamics we start with θ 0 namely no occurrence of excystment then cpm system 5 degenerates into the following cpm 0 equation 7 c p m 0 c α p p s 1 γ m d 1 p b 1 p 2 m s 2 β n p d 2 m b 2 m 2 it is trivial to show that the positive half axis of c axis is singular line that is every point on this line i e with p 0 is an equilibrium it seems difficult to qualitatively analyse eq 7 by the traditional linearized method fortunately there is an alternative approach brauer et al 2012 that enables us to find their final size and analyse the asymptotic properties see appendix b for details of the proof our theoretical analysis theorem b2 and numerical simulation fig 4 a and b show that the existence of sexual reproduction and asexual reproduction still ensures the pm system is sustainable even though the podocysts maintain dormancy for long periods that is there is no supplement from podocyst to polyp if the excystment rate θ is zero while the podocyst production rate α is not zero then the number of podocysts would tend to the upper bound s ˆ c ˆ 0 0 corresponding to each initial value with r 1 1 if θ 0 and r 1 1 the number of podocysts will increase even tend towards infinity while the polyp and the medusa maintain at positive values s c p m just like those are shown in fig 4 b that means the long periods of dormancy would result in a cardinal number of podocyst multiplying but would not affect the size of polyp and medusa the accumulation of podocysts can form a huge pool once a suitable environment brings θ 0 then polyps would acquire a lot of supplements and stored energy would be transferred from podocysts to polyps even to medusae the system would attain new equilibrium which does not vary with the change of θ fig 4 c and d since the equilibria of eqs 2 4 are independent of f t naturally the steady state is independent to θ furthermore the initial values are 10 50 10 10 in c which are different with d 100 100 100 100 perhaps no matter how long the podocysts sleep and how high the population reaches the stability of the positive equilibrium does not depend on the initial values hence the dormancy or excystment of podocysts has no effect on the system 5 for a long time but the possibility of n nomurai blooms could not be ruled out in short time 3 2 effect of podocyst production and strobilation with changing temperature next we discuss the effect of other two asexual reproduction processes i e the podocyst production and the strobilation which vary with temperature taking the dalian sea as an example we discuss the inter annual variation of temperature over time and study the short term dynamics of the cpm system we have the following nonautonomous analogue of 5 8 d c d t α t p 0 θ e θ τ c t τ d τ d p d t s 1 γ m 0 θ e θ τ c t τ d τ d 1 p b 1 p 2 d m d t s 2 β t n p d 2 m b 2 m 2 where α and β are the functions of temperature varying with time periodically written as α t and β t transform 8 like 5 we have the following equation 9 c α t p x p s 1 γ m x d 1 p b 1 p 2 m s 2 β t n p d 2 m b 2 m 2 x θ c θ x first we give a function fitting to the data of temperature over time fig 5 is the surface temperature of the dalian sea the data blue dots come from the department of natural resources of liaoning province and the date is about 800 days from feb 2 2014 to apr 19 2016 the fourier function of the red fitting curve is 10 t 12 83 8 531 c o s 0 01761 t 3 651 s i n 0 01761 t consider that β varies with changing temperature fig 6 a is the fitting curve of β t and the stars are the data which come from feng et al 2015 where the polyps of nemopilema nomurai were kept in two durations at low temperature of 5 c 40 days or 117 days before experimentations refer to the surface temperature in dalian where there are 49 days in 2015 or 78 days in 2016 below 5 c so with the data of β we choose the mean of the two experiments and polyps were fed once every 5 days the fitting curve represents 11 β t 0 t d 1 34 68 t 2 22 3 t 143 4 t d 1 where d 1 t 3 6 c t 22 c since the optimum temperature for strobilation by n nomurai polyps is 10 13 c feng et al 2015 which is corresponding to the dalian sea in mid may to early june and in november we can see that there are two peaks in b when the strobilation rate reaches the peak the ephyrae are released with maximum quantity since we regard ephyrae as incipient medusae the number of medusae also reaches its peak at the same time see fig 6 d it is incredible but we could not rule it out after all n nomurai can be found in november and december zhang et al 2012 in fact hernroth and gröndahl 1985 show that the ephyrae are released mainly in october and november then they rapidly descend to deeper water and settle down there overwinter fig 6 c shows that the three phases increase with β increasing affected by surface temperature of the dalian sea the function of α t with respect to temperature is given by dong et al 2013 which is standardized as follows 12 α t 0 t d 2 0 0182 t 2 0 1709 t 0 1297 40 t d 2 where d 2 t 7 5 c t 30 c fig 7 a shows that the size of podocysts increases with α increasing if we consider α as a function of temperature which varies periodically the pink of podocysts occurs at the hottest august about 200th day while the effect of α on polyps is very little and on medusae is almost to zero with eqs 10 12 we draw the change of the three phases with respect to temperature and time c and d demonstrate that the number of podocysts increases with temperature raising and reaches the peak at the same time with b which is not changed with the addition of β t except for a very small change in quantity compared with b the number of polyps and medusae in c and d has a distinct change by considering β t in which polyps and medusae reach their peaks at about 11 c mid may and november which is almost like fig 6 d from figs 6 and 7 we can conclude that the recurrence of medusae of nemopilema nomurai is mostly dependent on strobilation and the size of podocysts is mostly dependent on podocyst production rate they are all affected by periodically varying temperature in order to show how the system is dependent on the strobilation rate we present the following sensitivity analysis 4 sensitivity analysis and control strategies 4 1 local sensitivity analysis 6 referring to the formulas for the sensitivity indices s i in kong et al 2014 we compute the s i of the steady state with respect to the parameters of the system 6 and list them in table 2 the quantity of s i describes the strength of sensitivity of the steady state to the parameters while the sign indicates the positive or negative relationship with the parameters table 2 shows that the steady state of podocysts has the largest sensitivity indices to the podocyst production rate α which is consistent with fig 7 the stable size of polyps has the strongest relationship with intraspecific competition b 1 a negative relationship means polyps will stabilize at a higher level with lower b 1 which can be demonstrated in the following subsection the steady state of medusae is most sensitive to the effective supplement from bottom to top β s 2 n furthermore the steady states of both the polyps and medusae are more sensitive to the strobilation rate β than to the podocyst production rate α which verifies the conclusion of figs 6 and 7 in fact if there is no supplement from polyps to podocysts but the other processes exist then the number of podocysts tends to zero and the relationship of polyp medusa is not affected see theorem a5 the other sensitivity indices to the parameters can be found in table 2 sensitivity analysis provides the directions for control strategies 4 2 control strategies of system 5 in this section we investigate the strategies for controlling the size of medusae since the effect of the podocyst production rate α on medusa is very weak we will discuss other processes and factors from the sensitivity analysis controlling the supplement from the benthic to the pelagic is one of the most direct methods to control β fig 6 a shows that higher or lower temperature will bring it down to lessen s 2 we can increase the capture effort or raise the population size of predator cutting down the strobilation rate and the survival rate of ephyra have almost the same control effect the same s i with different control methods fig 6 c shows that the population sizes reduce with the decrease of β if we do that thoroughly in the ideal case what will happen let s 2 β n 0 and r 0 1 then e 2 α α d 1 b 1 α d 1 b 1 0 α α d 1 b 1 exists and is las theorem a6 and corollary a7 then medusae disappear and the control is effective in theory to control the intraspecific competition of medusae b 2 is also a choice s i 0 6623 in fact the intraguild predation is very common amongst jellyfish titelman et al 2007 even including the giant jellyfish nemopilema nomurai which can be preyed by cyanea nozakii wang et al 2020 however if c nozakii is introduced maybe it will bring new unexpected disasters hence it is not recommended to control the size of medusae by increasing b 2 next we will discuss the control of the supplement from the pelagic to the benthic which is determined by the sexual reproduction rate γ and the survival rate of planula s 1 studies indicate that the gonadal maturation of n nomurai is induced when the medusae are fatally damaged uye 2014 in other words when we try to control n nomurai by killing medusae we just help them to spawn and millions of eggs and sperm are released into the water feng et al 2015 after they combine metamorphose and settle down a new life cycle begins hence γ is not considered in our control strategies if we want to prevent the supplement from the pelagic to the benthic the method is to control the survival rate of planula e g by capturing fig 8 a shows that the population size reduces with the decreasing of s 1 if s 1 decreases to zero then an interior equilibrium e 2 exists and the number of every stage is inversely proportional to b 1 see theorem a11 for details that means even if we can control the top down supplement completely the population size is going to rise with the decreases of b 1 and the control is invalid see fig 8 c fig 8 b c demonstrate that if b 1 increases then the population size decreases furthermore for a bigger s 1 the number of medusae will decrease sharply with the increase in b 1 hence increasing b 1 fig 8 b or increasing b 1 and reducing s 1 fig 8 c are all the effective control strategies finally we discuss the control of the top down and bottom up supplement simultaneously fig 8 d demonstrates that the number of medusae will decline distinctly with the decreasing of s 1 and β that means the strategy is effective the mathematical theorems and the detailed proofs of this section are listed in appendix a all theoretical findings are summarized in table 3 5 conclusion and discussion we formulate a three stage life cycle model for nemopilema nomurai with distributed delay the emphasis is focused on what the roles of podocysts play in the life cycle in addition based on the surface temperature of the dalian sea we discuss the impact of podocyst production rate and strobilation rate on the size of the population theoretical analyses reveal some mechanisms driving the variation of population and sensitivity analysis provides the directions for control strategies theoretical analyses show that whether the excystment exists or not it only affects the number of podocysts but not the polyps or medusae in the long run if θ 0 then the number of podocysts can stabilize at some positive constant or go to zero if podocysts maintain dormancy for a long time that is θ 0 then the number of podocysts can stabilize at its initial value or maximum including infinity we conclude that the dormant podocysts have no discernible effect on the system 5 for a long time but its impacts on blooms in short periods of time cannot be ruled out numerical simulations and sensitivity analysis verify that the recurrence of medusae of n nomurai is dependent mostly on the bottom up supplement s 2 β n which is identified as the key process in the life cycle on the bloom of n nomurai with the help of sensitivity analysis we discuss the control strategies for medusa some of them are hard to accomplish or invalid such as reducing β by shifting ocean temperature introducing cyanea nozakii to prey on n nomurai as well as enhancing the harvest of planulae but overlooking the expansion of substrates meanwhile the effective control strategies are to increase the catch of ephyrae and reduce the expansion of substrates namely decrease the supplement from the benthic to the pelagic and prompt the intraspecific competition of polyps if one wants to control the survival of planula it will be effective by coupling the top down supplement s 1 with the first two methods that is decrease both s 1 and s 2 or decrease s 1 and increase b 1 simultaneously in brief it is most effective to control annual jellyfish outbreaks by cutting down the survival of ephyrae more attention should be paid to reducing the sprawl of artificial substrates in the long run compared cpm system and pm system in xie et al 2015 they have some similar results for polyp and medusa in theory for example polyp and medusa have the same ranges in the positively invariant set the existence conditions of extinct equilibrium e 0 boundary equilibrium e 2 s 2 β n 0 and positive equilibrium e are identical but the conditions of stability are different and it is difficult to prove the globally asymptotically stable for cpm system in addition they all show that the stable size of polyps is sensitive to intraspecific competition of polyps b 1 meanwhile it is worth mentioning that cpm system 5 and its nonautonomous version 8 are more complicated than pm system in xie et al 2015 especially in the cases that θ 0 and β changes annually the former points out that the number of podocysts would increase to infinity with the polyps existing and the number of podocysts reaches the maximum when the polyps die out in other words it depicts the accumulation process of jellyfish in the seabed the latter demonstrates the annual variation of population which has a more realistic significance than the pm system in conclusion the accumulating podocysts by long term dormancy have no discernible effect on the system for a long time the size of medusae of n nomurai is sensitive to the bottom up supplement and the strobilation is identified as the key process of the life cycle for the blooms of n nomurai controlling the bottom up supplement and reducing substrate expansion are all the effective control methods in addition to the above there are some problems worth discussing further it has been verified that the strobilation is the key process and to cut down β is the most important method to control the blooms of n nomurai here we only focus on the effect of temperature on strobilation more abiotic factors should be considered to control the outbreaks of medusae furthermore a higher strobilation rate of n nomurai appears at higher food supply level and no second strobilation occurs in unfed treatments feng et al 2015 therefore food supply should be considered as a biotic factor but not as general assumption the optimum temperature range is 10 to 13 c for strobilation feng et al 2015 which is corresponding to spring and early winter of the dalian sea it is helpful to cut off the second peak of medusa in early winter by getting the relationship between the survival rate of ephyra and temperature or the relationship with other factors medusa is also most sensitive to s 2 both sensitivity analysis and numerical simulation show that the intra specific competition among polyps has an important impact on population for the long run note that podocysts also occupy the space of substrate it is incredible that the accumulation of podocysts by dormancy has no influence on the population maybe the reason is that the competition between polyps and podocysts for space is not considered in our model which will be more significant for studying the influence of podocyst on nemopilema nomurai blooms at last fig 4 depicts that steady states are independent on their initial values we conjecture that the positive

24671,future projections based on the ipcc high emissions scenario rcp8 5 have previously shown that the pacific northwest coastal waters will be subjected to altered ocean states in the upwelled shelf waters resulting in higher primary productivity and increased regions of hypoxia and acidification in the inner estuarine waters such as the salish sea however corresponding effects on the lower trophic levels and submerged aquatic vegetation have not yet been quantified supported by new synoptic field data explicit coupled simulation of algae zooplankton and eelgrass biomass was accomplished for the first time in the salish sea we re applied the improved model to evaluate future ecological response and examined potential algal species shift but with the effects of zooplankton production metabolism and predation prey interactions included we also evaluated the role of eelgrass with respect to potential for improvements to dissolved oxygen and ph levels and as a mitigation measure against hypoxia and ocean acidification the results re confirm the possibility that there could be a substantial area days increase 52 fold in exposure of benthic and near bed pelagic species to hypoxic waters in 2095 the projections for ocean acidification similarly indicate 20 114 increase in exposure to lower ph corrosive waters with aragonite saturation state ωa 1 importantly projected increase in primary productivity was shown to propagate to higher trophic levels with 13 and 25 increases in micro and mesozooplankton biomass levels however the preliminary results also point to sensitivity of the eelgrass model to environmental stressor and potential loss eelgrass biomass in the future keywords climate change ocean acidification salish sea biophysical model phytoplankton

surface ph 0 33 0 003 and a reduction in global oxygen content 0 19 mg l 0 024 relative to the 1990s bopp et al 2013 however projected impacts are not uniform and can vary significantly based on geographic location and site specific conditions for example a worst case scenario sea level rise of 1 5 m projected for y2100 relative to y2000 based on the sea level change curve calculator version 2015 46 developed by the u s army corps of engineers huber and white 2015 for the pacific northwest u s coastal waters neah bay washington is nearly double the global projection similarly predicted dissolved oxygen do depletion for the subsurface waters of the continental slope 200 600 m that upwell on to the shelf along the oregon washington coastline of the u s 1 6 mg l is nearly an order of magnitude higher than the global mean projection bopp et al 2013 cocco et al 2013 this is of major concern for the ecosystems in the pacific northwest with numerous tide flats marshes and eelgrass zostera marina l beds that support habitats for thousands of fish and wildlife species which in turn are vital to the regional economy culture and quality of life these habitats are present in the large and complex estuarine reaches within the salish sea which includes puget sound the strait of juan de fuca and strait of georgia sub basins in u s and canadian waters see fig 1 there is therefore a growing urgency to improve our understanding of the vulnerability or resilience of these coastal waters and estuaries to stressors associated with climate change and future oceanic conditions an expected consequence of sea level rise is that the coastal marsh habitats will be affected higher temperatures will likely make harmful algal blooms more frequent and coupled with ocean acidification toxicity associated with some of the blooms may increase mauger et al 2015 moore et al 2011 2015 marine ecosystems will likely be impacted by the combined effects of the above stressors and changes to water quality and chemistry for example will likely affect species such as shellfish and salmon negatively understanding whether and how environmental conditions may impact food web structure is central to our ability to predict how food webs will respond to climate change gilbert 2019 there is much interest therefore in reproducing lowest trophic levels of the food web micro and meso zooplankton in the salish sea and quantifying the effects of climate change projections on the building blocks for use by the community for complex higher trophic level food web assessments although it is possible that some species such as submerged as eelgrass however could benefit from increased co2 and tolerate moderate temperature increases sustained high temperature and high salinity levels can also be a stressor to eelgrass waldbusser et al 2015 barton et al 2012 mantua et al 2010 sharma and liermann 2010 thom 1996 without site specific downscaling and modeling to account for physical processes such as circulation upwelling exchange processes and changes to local stream flows and pollutant nutrient loads the biogeochemical and ecological projections and expectations remain qualitative judgements and are somewhat inconclusive in terms of quantifying the severity and magnitude of projected impacts to the nearshore estuarine ecosystems khangaonkar et al 2019 examined future biogeochemical response within salish sea puget sound washington usa and georgia strait british columbia canada using the salish sea model khangaonkar et al 2018 driven by downscaled outputs from the national center for atmospheric research climate model community earth system model a single projection of 95 year change under the rcp8 5 high greenhouse gas emissions scenario was simulated results indicated that higher water temperatures lower ph and decreased do levels in the upwelled shelf waters in the future would propagate into the salish sea interestingly the results showed that overall circulation mixing and stratification were relatively unaffected by the projected changes in sea level 1 5 m meteorological forcing and hydrology the projected changes in ocean states over the continental shelf propagated into the salish sea resulted in an increase in average salish sea temperature 1 51 c a decrease in do 0 77 mg l and a ph reduction acidification 0 18 units in y2095 relative to historical y2000 the results also showed that algal biomass in the salish sea could increase by 23 with a potential shift from communities dominated by diatoms to ones dominated by dinoflagellates this particular result includes much uncertainty due to inherent simplifications one of the simplifications was that zooplankton were not simulated explicitly but the effects were included through a constant predation term composition of the zooplankton varies around puget sound influenced by many factors including river flow distance from the ocean depth temperature prey and predation copepods are the most abundant and typically the highest biomass taxonomic group but many other crustacean zooplankton e g euphausiids amphipods barnacle crab and shrimp larvae are important as are several species of gelatinous zooplankton including large cnidarian medusae the species composition is dominated by resident taxa but coastal upwelling associated taxa are seasonally advected into northern regions of the sound seasonal cycles also vary spatially with biomass peaking generally in june august in most regions and up to a month earlier in warmer southern regions interannual variability is less well known but seems to be associated with temperature and chlorophyll biomass keister et al 2019 another simplification was that while the model included a comprehensive sediment water interaction module it did not include submerged aquatic vegetation sav and associated nutrient and carbon source and sink mechanisms benthic aquatic primary producers such as sav are critical to nearshore ecosystems and food webs eelgrass in the salish sea in particular is widely recognized for its important ecological functions and is a valuable indicator of ecosystem health inclusion of benthic primary production from eelgrass on scales relevant to nearshore shellfish beds is of much interest as it is known to influence nearshore water chemistry including nutrient levels dissolved inorganic carbon dic concentrations and ph tejeda 2014 eelgrass is also being looked at as a potential mitigation measure to combat ocean acidification at a local level via carbon sequestration greiner et al 2013 washington state blue ribbon panel on ocean acidification 2012 benthic primary production may also provide benefits to nutrient pollution management related to hypoxia and low do levels in this paper supported by new synoptic field data from year 2014 we present a first fully coupled reproduction of observed biogeochemical interaction between phytoplankton zooplankton and eelgrass in the salish sea using an updated version of the salish sea model as part of this effort the salish sea model kinetics for do ph calibration were first improved by fine tuning the re aeration routine and algal kinetic parameters sav and zooplankton modules were then added and the model was re calibrated only one species of sav eelgrass zostera marina l was simulated the model was then applied to simulate biogeochemical cycles in the salish sea with ecological interactions between phytoplankton zooplankton and eelgrass simulated explicitly for the historical condition represented by y2000 and compared with a future projection for y2095 also included in this paper are the results of an eelgrass sensitivity test that provides a screening level assessment of potential effects of eelgrass presence on mitigating ocean acidification on a local as well as salish sea wide scale 2 methods the salish sea model solves reynolds averaged navier stokes equations for turbulent flows with the boussinesq approximation in an integral form by computing fluxes between non overlapping horizontal triangular control volumes the model simulates water surface elevation velocity temperature salinity sediment and water quality constituents forced by river and wastewater inflows tides and meteorological drivers such as wind and solar radiation fig 1 upper left panel shows the model domain which encompasses vancouver island completely allowing tides to propagate into the salish sea around vancouver island through johnstone strait and the strait of juan de fuca the hydrodynamic component of the salish sea model uses the finite volume community ocean model fvcom chen et al 2003 with an unstructured grid framework and has been discussed in detail previously khangaonkar et al 2011 2017 2018 the biogeochemical component of the salish sea model is based on ce qual icm a three dimensional time variable integrated compartment model cerco and cole 1994 cerco et al 1995 for application to the salish sea an offline approach of coupling fvcom to ce qual icm was used the approach was developed by kim and khangaonkar 2012 in collaboration with the university of massachusetts dartmouth resulting in the fvcom icm code the baseline biogeochemical model includes 23 state variables temperature salinity two species of phytoplankton diatoms p1 and dinoflagellates p2 labile and refractory dissolved organic carbon doc and particulate organic carbon nh4 nitrate no2 no3 labile and refractory dissolved organic nitrogen and particulate organic nitrogen po4 labile and refractory dissolved organic phosphorous do dic and total alkalinity ta the model includes a sediment diagenesis module that allows directly coupled interaction between the water column and sediments through the processes of organic sediment settling and burial and remineralization and carbonate chemistry with dic ta pco2 and ph khangaonkar et al 2018 2019 bianucci et al 2018 fig 2 provides a schematic representation of the biogeochemical components of the fvcom icm v4 0 one of the challenges of simulating do and hypoxia in the salish sea has been simultaneously achieving satisfactory calibration with dic and ph variables through numerous sensitivity tests reaeration was identified as a key parameter requiring improvement as it affects both do and dic in the surface layers and impacts biogeochemical response the reaeration rate is proportional to the dissolved gas deficit relative to its saturation state t d g k r δ z d g s d g where dg is the dissolved gas concentration mg l d g s is the saturation concentration in water and δ z is the model layer thickness the reaeration coefficient kr also known as reaeration velocity specified in the units of m d 1 is a function of wind speed w m s 1 and is given by 1 k r 0 251 w 2 therefore an empirical coefficient has the units m d 1 m s 1 2 as part of this effort to improve model skill we tested two different formulations for α 0 54 0 0233t 0 002s per hartman and hammond 1985 α 0 24 sc 660 0 5 per wanninkhof 2014 s and t are salinity and temperature while sc is the schmidt number ratio of momentum diffusivity kinematic viscosity and molecular diffusion in the high energy fjord like waters of the salish sea the re aeration provided by the wanninkhof 2014 method during the winter months with minimal primary production and photosynthesis was insufficient to match the observed do levels the hartman and hammond 1985 approach provided the required re aeration in the winter but adversely affected the biogeochemical response with excessive re aeration levels during the summer months the reduced primary production in the summer resulted in lower particulate organic matter pom lower doc and affected ph predictions for improved year round do and ph predictions the fall and winter month oct nov dec jan feb mar reaeration was simulated using the hartman and hammond 1985 formulation and the spring and summer months apr may jun jul aug sep were simulated using wanninkopf 2014 however following this update to re aeration formulation it became clear that the previously established photosynthetic rate was likely set too high using do ph and algal biomass as indicators it was determined that primary productivity and subsequent generation of pom and its mineralization was too high the model performance improved considerably when maximum photosynthetic rates for diatom and dinoflagellates were reduced from the upper range limit of 350 to a mid range value 250 g c g 1 chl d 1 the above improvements in reaeration reduction in maximum photosynthetic rates and minor tuning of other phytoplankton kinetic parameters allowed year round harmonization of do and ph predictions with domain wide rmses of 0 94 mg l and 0 14 units respectively 2 1 light availability the ability to account for heterogeneity induced by turbidity plumes and light availability during periods of high river flows was particularly important for this effort given the interest in simulation of distributed eelgrass beds around the salish sea shoreline that are sensitive to available light to account for these turbidity plumes and incorporate their impact on light availability or irradiance distribution inorganic suspended sediments iss were added to the biogeochemical model and calibrated using a combination of available measurements of turbidity irradiance as photosynthetically available radiation and aerial observations the details of irradiance calculation can be found in cerco and moore 2001 cerco et al 2002 2010 turbidity is a function of total suspended solids concentration which is computed within the model as a result of loading settling and resuspension processes total suspended sediment loads for the rivers and runoff streams were estimated using rating curves developed by the u s geological survey usgs for their respective watersheds fig 3 shows an example plot of comparison of predicted turbidity and measured data at selected sites in the main basin of puget sound and sub basins such as hood canal and possession sound with and without iss 2 2 zooplankton biomass in the salish sea micro and mesozooplankton simulation in prior efforts with fvcom icm in the salish sea the zooplankton effect on phytoplankton was considered implicitly through a predation term khangaonkar et al 2012 2018 2019 bianucci et al 2018 in this effort zooplankton were incorporated explicitly with microzooplankton and mesozooplankton groups each individual micro and meso group represents a spectrum of species the mathematical approach and the formulation of zooplankton kinetics were adopted from cerco and noel 2004 and have been previously applied to chesapeake bay and lake erie using fvcom icm by other researchers xia et al 2016 jiang et al 2015 in the zooplankton module microzooplankton are set as the primary predators of the phytoplankton as the secondary predators mesozooplankton are formulated to consume microzooplankton however a fraction of phytoplankton biomass is also consumed by mesozooplankton as some species tend to consume phytoplankton at their early stages of physiology or depending on seasonal food abundance and preference el sabaawi et al 2010 as shown in fig 2 carbon and nutrients consumed by zooplankton through grazing on phytoplankton and detritus are returned into the available nutrients and detritus pools through respiration and mortality in this simplified formulation zooplankton abundance is driven primarily by prey availability transport is passive and motility or vertical migration is not considered although the microzooplankton and mesozooplankton groups have the same mathematical form for the production each individual group has distinct parameterization for each term in the zooplankton production eq 2 below to reflect the group specific kinetics 2 d z y d t g z y b m z y m z y z y p r z y where z y zooplankton

rate of zooplankton g z y for both groups of zooplankton depends on factors such as prey availability and grazing assimilation efficiency and respiration among others in the zooplankton sub model grazing is represented by a maximum ration formulation equivalent to the famous michaelis menten monod equation hansen et al 1997 cerco and noel 2004 the mathematical formulation for g z y is adopted from cerco and noel 2004 and is shown in eq 3 for group y 3 g z y p a z y k h c z y p a z y r m a x y e y 1 0 r f y f t here p a z y is the prey available to zooplankton group y g c m 3 and is

parameters require group specific values which were determined during model calibration basal metabolism b m z y for both zooplankton groups sz and lz is modeled as an exponentially increasing function of temperature by adopting the simplified approach in cerco and noel 2004 both zooplankton groups are subject to mortality at low do concentrations we assume that the mortality does not occur until the do reaches a threshold value which depends on the type of species and other environmental conditions we have set that value at the 2 mg l definition of hypoxia predation on zooplankton is simulated as a function of zooplankton and predator biomass which is assumed proportional to zooplankton prey biomass for a detailed description of zooplankton kinetic equations used in fvcom icm see cerco and noel 2004 2 3 eelgrass simulation through submerged aquatic vegetation module eelgrass occurs throughout puget sound within the photic zone the distribution of the plant is generally limited by light at the lower depth limit thom et al 2008 and by exposure and wave energy at the upper edge thom et al 2014b eelgrass is found to depths of 3 to 7 m mllw in most of puget sound but extends to 10 m in the san juan islands and the strait of juan de fuca christiaen et al 2019 other limiting factors for eelgrass include substrate type temperature and salinity thom et al 2001 thom et al 2003 thom et al 2014b nutrients n and p are important for eelgrass growth however nutrients may not be limiting in puget sound yang et al 2013 eelgrass size biomass and density vary spatially and temporally thom et al 2003 thom et al 2014b in general size is negatively correlated with density yang et al 2013 with density decreasing with increasing depth thom et al 2008 and total above ground biomass per unit area remains relatively constant olesen and sand jensen 1994 eelgrass in fvcom icm was incorporated through the sav model based on the formulation and implementation in the ce qual icm model studies of chesapeake bay cerco and moore 2001 cerco et al 2002 2010 the sav model has five state variables four of which represent plant components a leaves the photosynthetic portions of the above ground plant biomass lf g c m 2 b stems the structural non photosynthetic portions of the above ground plant biomass st g c m 2 c roots the below ground portions of the plant biomass associated with anchoring the plant and with nutrient uptake rt g c m 2 d tubers or rhizomes the below ground organs associated with propagation and with energy storage in the model rhizomes accumulate plant carbon during summer store this carbon over winter and transfer the carbon to above ground biomass in spring tb g c m 2 and e epiphytes algae that grow attached to leaves viable algae are associated with detrital organic matter and with inorganic solids ep g c epiphytes g m2 leaf all plant production is assumed to take place within the leaves a portion of the gross production is lost through active metabolism or photo respiration the remainder is routed to the four plant components all plant components lose biomass through basal metabolism biomass may be routed from the

experiments the salish sea model setup for baseline performance assessment presented here is based on y2014 conditions it uses procedures identical to those described previously by khangaonkar et al 2018 the model is forced with daily values of freshwater inflow from a total of 68 watersheds including 34 major rivers and 99 wastewater discharges the biogeochemical component of the model includes daily concentrations of nutrient and water quality constituent loads estimated using a combination of hydrological and multiple regression analyses based on monitoring data mohamedali et al 2011 temperature t and salinity s profiles at the ocean boundary were obtained from the hycom model from nodes over the continental shelf and interpolated to the model ocean boundary ocean boundary values for most water quality variables were set based on available climatological data from a combination of world ocean atlas and department of fisheries and oceans canada monitoring database with the exception of do nitrate ta and dic variables that were specified using regressions to salinity developed by the university of washington uw personal communication from ryan mccabe and parker maccready of uw the addition of explicit predation by micro and mesozooplankton required adjustment of some of the algal kinetics parameters to ensure model error statistics and skill were not compromised a part of algal predation is now done explicitly through the zooplankton module therefore it was necessary to reduce the base predation rate specified in the phytoplankton module to allow for direct grazing by zooplankton this was done through iterative calibration tests in which the background predation was reduced in steps from its original value of 1 0 d 1 until reasonable match for algal biomass was obtained resulting in a background predation rate of 0 5 d 1 the base predation rate although reduced accounts for mortality and predation from causes beyond direct consumption by micro and mesozooplankton the addition of zooplankton also altered the temporal response of the model and caused the phytoplankton peaks to occur earlier in the year the zooplankton biomass is typically low early in the year with reduced base predation and without zooplankton grazing the diatom growth was initiated and peaked nearly a month earlier than observed the summer growth of dinoflagellates also occurred sooner than expected and did not last through the end of summer to retain the model skill in matching diatom and dinoflagellate peak growth and die off timing as observed the optimum temperature for the growth of diatoms tmp1 was increased from 12 c to 14 c and the optimum temperature for the growth of dinoflagellates tmp2 was increased from 18 c to 20 c this adjustment is within desirable range of temperatures for diatom growth of 10 c 18 c montagnes and franklin 2001 zhang et al 2018 and 15 c 25 c for dinoflagellates growth souza et al 2014 boyd et al 2013 overall model performance was evaluated using error statistics such as absolute mean error ame or mean error me to assess bias and root mean square error rmse the ame and rmse of time series with n elements are defined as follows 12 a m e 1 n x mdl x obs 13 r m s e x mdl x obs 2 n where x mdl and x obs are the values from the model and observations respectively to assess model skill we computed the willmott skill score wss willmott 1982 defined as 14 w s s 1 x mdl x obs 2 x mdl x obs x obs x obs 2 where an overbar represents a time average the wss is a measure of the level of agreement between the observed and modeled values a value of 1 indicates perfect agreement and a value of 0 indicates no agreement model recalibration and validation for this update of the salish sea model was conducted for y2014 using the same data set consisting of monthly profiles from 24 water quality stations maintained by washington state department of ecology ecology and shown in fig 1 we then revisited a model experiment designed to assess future biogeochemical response in inner salish sea water khangaonkar et al 2019 but this time with an improved model including the complex effects of phytoplankton zooplankton and eelgrass biogeochemical interactions recent future climate predictions ipcc fifth assessment including downscaled hydrology and meteorology from a single ensemble member from cmip5 gcm climate model and multiple ensembles members of ocean states from the cesm le ocean model were available for the pacific northwest and were used to set up historical and future scenarios the approach selected was to use this single available projection for the high emissions rcp8 5 scenario with an arbitrary ocean state ensemble average and focus on the projected difference between climatological conditions defined as 1 historical y2000 temporal average of years 1995 2004 the last 10 years of available historical predictions and 2 future y2095 conditions temporal average of 2090 2100 the last 10 years of available future predictions the approach of averaging inputs over 10 year windows was to minimize the effects of interannual variability and limitations of running a specific year from a single member from the ensemble therefore two salish sea model simulations were conducted using inputs derived from downscaled cesm products 1 historical y2000 simulation and 2 future y2095 simulation the approach selected was to treat y2000 and y2095 simulations as perturbation tests using the previously calibrated setup from 2014 in other words y2000 and y2095 simulations were conducted by replacing the river ocean boundary and meteorological inputs and retaining all other model parameters at the previously calibrated y2014 values 3 results 3 1 model validation and skill table 1 lists

example to compare simulated surface and bottom layer concentrations of chlorophyll a do nitrate and ph with monthly monitoring data fig 4 the upper layer in the salish sea model occupies 3 of the

observations for ta dic and ph variables left panel and an example comparison of profiles from a representative puget sound station right panel zooplankton model setup and validation relied on two sets of data only limited historical microzooplankton data were available from the neah bay location near the entrance to the salish sea from the ecology and oceanography of harmful algal blooms pacific northwest project ecohab pnw lessard 2009 mesozooplankton data from 2014 were available from king county s zooplankton monitoring program conducted in collaboration with long live the kings and uw who collect zooplankton samples at three locations in puget sound twice monthly february november and once monthly december january keister et al 2017 the mesozooplankton data were also used first to ensure that initiation of growth and timing of the peak were reasonably similar to observed data but most importantly they were used to provide closure for the zooplankton model through the predation term initial setup of model was based on literature based values that were adjusted to best reproduce observed behavior from puget sound addition of zooplankton kinetics significantly increased the oxygen demand from water column respiration and pom production and decay and affected do dic and ph levels the final selection of parameter values required adjustment of prey utilization

compares predicted mesozooplankton biomass plots with data from the three king county monitoring program puget sound stations the model predictions match observed data reasonably well at the point williams and point jefferson stations but appear to overpredict the biomass at the east passage station also shown is a qualitative comparison with available microzooplankton data from the ecohab pnw neah bay station the microzooplankton data plotted in fig 6 include all available data from prior years which served as a qualitative guide to manage the model response characteristics such as timing of growth initiation peak biomass and reduction die off among others the eelgrass model developed here primarily ensures that the salish sea model computations properly account for associated biogeochemical process resulting in carbon do and nutrient fluxes along the shoreline and shallow embayments with existing healthy eelgrass meadows this intermediate scale version of the salish sea model does not include intertidal flats and is built with bathymetry that is smoothed resulting deeper depths along the shoreline to overcome this limitation and to simulate eelgrass with reasonable accuracy the model uses a sub grid nodes identified with eelgrass present for simulation where eelgrass growth is allowed to occur accurate and unsmoothed site specific depth is provided for use in eelgrass related calculations in particular for estimating submergence depth for light attenuation at the eelgrass nodes initial conditions that describe the state of eelgrass vegetation in the domain at the start of simulation were specified based on available abundance maps developed by the washington state department of natural resources wdnr dowty et al 2017 while considerable data on spatial coverage and delineation of eelgrass beds exist eelgrass biomass time series data from puget sound are very limited wdnr collected above ground and below ground eelgrass biomass data from the dumas bay site in puget sound in 2014 these were averaged and used nominally to specify initial biomass at all locations of 10 g c m 2 for leaf and root while 5 g c m 2 were used as the initial condition for stem and rhizomes tuber respectively also available from the same site were eelgrass biomass data collected by thom and albright 1990 the combined dataset was used in the calibration process of adjusting the parameters and model response to best reproduce observed above ground and below ground eelgrass biomass table 3 lists the major eelgrass kinetic parameters selected as part of this

and ph due to limited data available from 2014 validation of the model zooplankton and sav was qualitative and quantitative skill assessment was not conducted with the upgrades and revision of

included 3 2 projected change in salish sea y2095 relative to y2000 inputs to the salish sea model corresponding to future y2095 climate scenario rcp8 5 based on cesm simulations are summarized schematically in fig 8 these the future changes in nutrients ph and do in the northeast pacific were derived previously and are described in detail along with supporting justification in khangaonkar et al 2019 in general as a result of global warming temperatures over the continental shelf air and sea surfaces and river discharges are all warmer by 2 4 c based on sea level change curve calculator version 2015 46 developed by the u s army corps of engineers huber and white 2015 the worst case impact estimate for neah bay washington located at the strait of juan de fuca entrance to the salish sea is 1 5 m although future wastewater flow magnitudes are higher freshwater inflows from gaged rivers and nonpoint source runoff are predicted to be lower by 4 7 relative to historical y2000 flows khangaonkar et al 2019 have previously shown that the impact of sea level rise on overall circulation in the salish sea is relatively small a possible explanation for this finding is that the 1 5 m mean sea level change in this fjord represents only a small relative depth change δh 0 013 based on average depth of the salish sea of 113 m the effect on increased circulation strength is likely counteracted by the effects of reduced salinity gradients ocean chemistry is predicted to change as well the salish sea also is expected to experience a higher concentration of nutrient loads from the ocean boundary river mouths and wastewater treatment plants the incoming estuarine exchange flow from the pacific ocean is predicted to be lower in do by 1 7 mg l for the future rcp8 5 scenario note that the ocean boundary change values in fig 8 are based on an average of only three arbitrarily selected members from the cmip5 ensemble initial conditions for physical and biogeochemical states were set up using climatological data and subjected to a 1 year spin up the model was then restarted using the warmed up conditions and the simulation was repeated this approach was used for the historical as well as future runs evolution of natural biological systems could take over 100 years a complex timeseries prediction of salish sea ecosystem over a 100 year time frame is not attempted here instead we focus on simulating a typical one year cycle using historical y2000 conditions and comparing it with the response for an equivalent year in the future projection of y2095 conditions the approach is based on an understanding that biogeochemical cycles within the salish sea are controlled by flushing time of the estuary which is 1 year the spin up of 1 year from uniform initial conditions cold start has shown to successfully generate estuary wide gradients to conduct a hot start simulation using end of the cold start year as the initial condition 3 2 1 phytoplankton and zooplankton as shown in fig 8 nutrient loads from oceanic and land based sources are expected to increase in the future y2095 rcp8 5 scenario relative to historical levels a 6 higher concentration of no2 no3 in the tidally averaged estuarine inflow from the pacific ocean 44 increase in no2 no3 loads from rivers and near doubling of wastewater inflows result in higher availability of no2 no3 in the euphotic zone in combination with higher surface temperatures a significant increase in algal biomass in the future was predicted previously khangaonkar et al 2019 however in this assessment with the explicit inclusion of zooplankton and eelgrass kinetics the results were different fig 9 shows comparisons of predicted nitrate and algal biomass in the euphotic zone for the historical y2000 and future y2095 despite a 16 increase in euphotic zone nitrate mass in future y2095 the predicted change in algal biomass 0 05 in future y2095 is negligible and is in contrast with the previous prediction of 23 0 increase in algal biomass in future y2095 as reported in khangaonkar et al 2019 here we find that increase in future primary production and algal growth results in higher prey availability along with a corresponding zooplankton response increase in dynamic predation by the zooplankton community is reflected in an average 13 increase of microzooplankton and an 25 increase of mesozooplankton biomass in future y2095 as shown in time series of predicted nitrate algae and zooplankton biomass in the upper 30 m euphotic zone in fig 9 both zooplankton species were set to grow at the same optimum temperature of 20 c but a higher increase in biomass is predicted for mesozooplankton compared to microzooplankton this is likely due to the microzooplankton being set up to prey primarily on algae while mesozooplankton have a higher diversity of prey available through consumption of microzooplankton and algae this is reasonable considering that more than 50 of the mesozooplankton group is composed of crustacean species like copepods which have a diverse diet in addition to consuming microzooplankton and dinoflagellates olson and strom 2002 it is noted however that these predictions of higher zooplankton in the future are based on a constant rate of predation on zooplankton by higher tropic levels 3 2 2 eelgrass biomass projections of future climate effects on eelgrass are of interest given the community wide desire to increase eelgrass biomass in puget sound as part of restoration efforts thom et al 2014a thom et al 2018 the restoration of eelgrass as a critical ecosystem component and indicator of environmental health is a high priority in washington state s puget sound where the goal is to increase the current eelgrass coverage by 20 i e 4000 ha it is expected that in the future with higher sea level some of the eelgrass may be lost due to submergence beyond critical depths but in this assessment we elected to exclude the sea level rise effect under the assumption that there will be new area available for eelgrass migration to higher ground however eelgrass could also be impacted by light availability ralph et al 2007 mcglathery 2001 and temperature effects jarvis et al 2014 fig 10 a shows predicted domain wide total average eelgrass biomass for the historical y2000 and future y2095 scenarios the eelgrass biomass evaluated here only includes the leaves and stem parts of the plants for above ground portion and roots and rhizomes for the below ground portion as shown in fig 10 a the results point to the possibility that there could be a significant reduction 48 in average annual eelgrass biomass for the future y2095 scenario relative to y2000 biomass these results are contrary to expectation and require a careful review exposure to upwelled water with higher levels of dic in the future y2095 scenario were expected to provide a beneficial effect and result in increased eelgrass growth a plausible explanation is that increased nutrients lead to increased primary productivity which reduces light availability and decreases eelgrass consistent with zimmerman et al 1987 and yang et al 2013 the eelgrass growth rate is also extremely sensitivity to temperature and salinity levels a closer examination of fig 10 b shows that major eelgrass losses are predicted to occur in the larger eelgrass meadows near intertidal embayments such as padilla bay bellingham bay skagit bay port susan bay stillaguamish river port gardner snohomish river and nisqually reach as opposed to the eelgrass beds along the shorelines these areas are subject to maximum changes in temperature and salinity under the future scenarios and the associated limitations on growth dominate over the benefits of higher levels of nutrients and dic available in the future similarly reduced light availability in the future due to increased primary production and increased levels of suspended sediment and poc concentration in the water column likely contributed to this result 3 2 3 hypoxia and acidification typical do levels in the surface waters are high in the salish sea due to the large number of freshwater runoffs with high do re aeration the relatively cool temperatures of the water surface for a significant period of the year and healthy levels of primary production and photosynthesis however the salish sea water surface is expected to experience a temperature increase of 1 5 c in future y2095 according to the rcp8 5 scenario khangaonkar et al 2019 despite this the dominant effect of re aeration and the resulting do from increased primary production maintains a high level of do 8 12 mg l in the surface layers in contrast to the euphotic zone the near bed waters undergo a reduction in do due to the combined effects of upwelling respiration decay mineralization and sediment oxygen demand from settling and decomposition of organic matter from algae zooplankton and eelgrass origins this reduction of do leads to hypoxia do 2 mg l conditions in waters at near bed which threatens the benthic and near bed pelagic marine ecosystem the future climate change y2095 has the potential to exacerbate the hypoxia condition in near bed waters with the increasing nutrient levels according to rcp8 5 scenario fig 11 compares hypoxic exposure at near bed in the salish sea for the projected future y2095 and historical y2000 scenarios in the context of hypoxic area days as shown in the figure there is a substantial increase 52 fold in hypoxic area days in future y2095 implying a significantly high exposure of benthic and near bed pelagic species to hypoxic waters also the near bed area with hypoxic water is expected to be increased by 16 relative to the total area of the salish sea in future y2095 as per model predictions the ph levels of the salish sea are significantly influenced by the low ph levels in the upwelled water over the continental shelf that enters the system through the bottom layer exchange bianucci et al 2018 also highlighted the importance of low ph water from land based fresh water sources i e rivers algae growth and dic consumption during the summer increase ph levels in the surface however decay of the poc generated through algal predation excretion die off and dic generated through metabolism and respiration draws ph and do levels down in the water column reaching lowest levels during late spring in the future y2095 scenario the results are dominated by the reduction in ph of incoming oceanic water by nearly 0 36 units this in combination with an increase in pco2 levels from 364 μatm for y2000 to 877 μatm for y2095 the future scenario results in significant increase in exposure to more acidic waters results are presented in the form of aragonite saturation state ωa defined as ω a c a 2 c o 3 2 c a c o 3 where dissolved calcium ca2 is the seawater concentration of dissolved calcium ions co3 2 is the seawater concentration of carbonate ions caco3 is the solubility of aragonite in seawater and ω is the calculated saturation state of seawater seawater with low ph also has low aragonite saturation state ωa aragonite is the least stable form of calcium carbonate formed by many shell building organisms and its saturation state indicates whether aragonite tends to precipitate ωa 1 or dissolve ωa 1 ωa levels below 1 are of concern as this indicates conditions unsuitable for calcifying organisms to build shells which could result in a cascade of impacts to the food web fig 12 top panels shows contour plots of exposure to seawater in days with ωa 1 for the y2000 conditions for the surface and the bottom layers in the strait of juan de fuca and puget sound regions of interest results show that most regions experience some days during which ωa 1 during the winter season most regions experience ωa levels that are 1 in the surface as well as bottom waters the phytoplankton growth during the summer helps raise ph levels in the photic zone through uptake of dic which helps increase ωa levels in the surface waters vertical circulation cells in the system described in khangaonkar et al 2017 2018 then help mix higher ωa waters from the surface to the lower layers improving the ph and ωa levels relative to the low levels in the incoming upwelled shelf waters the results show that for y2000 in the summer months of may june and july 30 40 of near bed water has ωa 1 and is likely supportive of shell forming organisms however in some sub basins such as hood canal bottom layer ωa levels are 1 throughout the year these simulation results for y2000 scenario match the present ωa conditions in salish sea described by several researchers eg feeley et al 2010 feeley et al 2012 and pelletier et al 2018 fig 12 bottom panels show projections for the y2095 scenario results point to the possibility that bottom layer of salish sea will be exposed to low ph waters with ωa 1 100 of the time bottom right for the bottom layer this represents an increase in exposure to corrosive water of 20 however for the surface waters including the photic zone the projection for the future y2095 scenario represents a near doubling over 114 increase in exposure to waters with ωa 1 4 discussion the primary objective of this study was to revisit the projections of biogeochemical response of the salish sea environment given changing oceanic states due to climate change effects and population growth but with due consideration to interaction with lower trophic levels i e zooplankton kinetics and water column interaction with sav in the form of eelgrass the model results were prepared for comparison of historical conditions for y2000 with the future conditions for y2095 based on the rcp8 5 emissions scenario response of the planktonic community eelgrass growth and exposure to hypoxia and ocean acidification were examined this was feasible in part due to recent data collection effort related to zooplankton and eelgrass by ecology wdnr and uw availability of this data facilitated improvements to the salish sea model kinetics through incorporation of turbidity zooplankton and eelgrass and a recalibration effort resulting in domain wide harmonization of calibration parameters and rmse of 0 92 mg l for do and 0 14 units for ph the results show that changing oceanic and meteorological conditions will result in perturbations to the biogeochemical cycles that are likely to propagate all the way through the food web prior results limited to primary producers projected a significant increase in phytoplankton biomass this has now been superseded by the results here that show a corresponding increase in predation of phytoplankton biomass by zooplankton but that algal biomass is maintained at levels comparable to the present the zooplankton growth for y2095 conditions is projected to increase by 13 25 for micro and mesozooplankton respectively however it is noted that this predicted increase in zooplankton is also affected by lack of connection to higher trophic levels and other simplifying assumptions in the zooplankton kinetic processes the current version of the zooplankton kinetic model does not include the active transport by diel vertical migration which is a vital zooplankton mediated carbon transport mechanism there is a significant impact from diel vertical migration on carbon based detritus pools i e poc and dissolved carbon doc which has an indirect influence on phytoplankton growth further fvcom icm is a carbon based model that transports carbon biomass to the upper food web making zooplankton growth sensitive to the prey availability over other ecological and physiological factors in the epipelagic environment therefore these model predictions related to increase of zooplankton growth in future y2095 should not be conclusively interpreted as an increase in prey availability for species in the upper pelagic food web in contrast to predicted increase for zooplankton the y2095 scenario simulations for eelgrass showed that annual average production of eelgrass biomass would be reduced by nearly 50 the reduction of eelgrass biomass for future conditions is attributed to increased temperature increased salinity and reduced light availability in the shallow nearshore environments in the future the parameterization of eelgrass growth in the current version of the model is highly sensitive to temperature salinity and light availability further the current eelgrass model lacks kinetics related to processes such as reproduction and active spreading light attenuation due to shadowing effect by the leaves and ammonia toxicity on growth among others additionally the effects of changes in nutrients on macroalgae were not examined research has shown that increases in nutrients can result in excessive growth of green algae ulvoids in puget sound van alstyne 2016 which can compete with or bury eelgrass these model features will be implemented in an upgraded version of the kinetic model together with a robust parameterization supported by more detailed observations despite these limitations the results were retained to guide to future actions as assessing the impact of eelgrass on the epipelagic ecosystem is of strategic importance to estuary wide restoration efforts the role of seagrass i e eelgrass in sustainable maintenance of a marine ecosystem has been highlighted in cerco and moore 2001 and baird et al 2016 eelgrass contribution in nutrient uptake and the role of eelgrass as a natural habitat for several marine species for their spawning and growth periods has led the recovery and restoration programs in coastal systems although the eelgrass module is in its early stage of development the results indicate that the magnitude of eelgrass interaction with water column at the larger salish sea or even at sub basin scale is relatively small the water quality of the salish sea is substantially dominated by the large volume fluxes associated with regionwide algal blooms and tidal exchange flows however the influence of eelgrass on site specific improvement of water quality particularly in proximity to eelgrass meadows or local embayments could be significant by providing enhancement of do and ph levels as a simple test case to assess the local impact on water quality of eelgrass growth we studied the water column do and ph variations qualitatively for the scenarios with and without eelgrass modulation for a selected area in padilla bay where an abundance of eelgrass is located during these tests it became clear that the magnitude of water column response was sensitive to eelgrass model parameters that may vary by location for example site specific variation in uptake of nutrients via roots relative to leaves and stems affects the magnitude of water column impact similarly effect of eelgrass on sediment oxygen demand and nutrient fluxes may be affected by site specific substrate conditions in fig 13 a noticeable improvement in do can be seen during the summer period due to eelgrass activities the ph response predicted by the eelgrass was equally encouraging it is noted however that padilla bay site in puget sound supports one of the healthiest eelgrass meadows in the salish sea region a strong effect such as that shown in fig 13 was expected but required adjustment of model parameters for high level of water column interaction that one would expect at padilla bay at other locations along the shorelines dominant effects from other biogeochemical processes poor nutrient supply from the sediments lack of intertidal vertical resolution and bathymetric smoothing along the shoreline could dilute the result diminishing the predicted influence of eelgrass growth on water column variables given that these results are dependent on model parameterization and the lack of site specific data for detailed calibration we have elected to retain these results at a qualitative level for quantitative assessments and more robust predictions with respect to eelgrass improvement in nearshore resolution with the addition of intertidal wetting and drying processes and site specific calibration of water quality parameters in the presence of eelgrass would be required during this salish sea model upgrade there were significant changes to some of the kinetic parameter values relative to prior versions this does not imply that prior versions and associated results are incorrect but that the addition of new modules and formulation upgrades have modified the biogeochemical response of the model and altered the role and influence of some of the parameters for example the modified re aeration formulation improved algal growth during the summer significantly which allowed maximum photosynthetic rates pm1 and pm2 for diatom and dinoflagellates to be reduced from the upper range limit of 350 g c g 1 chl d 1 used previously to a mid range value 250 g c g 1 chl d 1 similarly the addition of explicit predation by zooplankton altered the algal growth response in the model resulting in early diatom growth spurt and overall loss of calibration using new observations of zooplankton biomass and the timing of peak growth as a simulation target diatom and dinoflagellate growth timing was fine tuned allowing them to reach the peak and sustain the growth later in the year this was accomplished by altering the optimum temperature for the growth of diatoms tmp1 from 12 c to 14 c and dinoflagellates tmp2 from 18 c to 20 c but we recognize that field verification is needed through diatom and dinoflagellate monitoring in the salish sea to conclusively determine if the optimum temperatures for algae growth derived indirectly through model calibration reflect site specific conditions accurately similarly it was necessary to reduce the base predation rate specified in the phytoplankton module from 1 d 1 to 0 5 d 1 through iterative tests to account for the newly implemented direct grazing by zooplankton these changes were necessary to ensure the overall algal biomass along with do and ph calibration was reproduced with the same or improved level of accuracy 5 conclusion an improved version of the salish sea model is presented which accounts for the influence of river wash loads on background turbidity and light availability a modified re aeration formulation with seasonal variation and with new modules for explicit simulation of eelgrass and zooplankton the model was recalibrated and achieved regionwide rmse targets for do and ph of 0 92 mg l and 0 14 units simultaneously representing a significant improvement in performance this effort supported by new synoptic meso zooplankton and eelgrass biomass data allowed a first coupled reproduction of observed interaction between phytoplankton growth eelgrass production predation by zooplankton and nutrient consumption from the photic zone in the salish sea the addition of microzooplankton and mesozooplankton along with nutrient source and sink terms associated with eelgrass provides a more sophisticated and complete picture of the salish sea ecosystem up to the lowest trophic levels of the food web in the salish sea the model application for future ocean states and climate conditions provided results that were mostly consistent with those presented in a prior assessment khangaonkar et al 2019 as in the prior effort the results are limited in that they are based on projections from a single ensemble member run of the cesm model however we believe that the results we have developed through this one projection still provide a useful peek into the type of response one may expect over the salish sea in particular the results reconfirmed the projection that there will likely be a substantial increase 52 fold in hypoxic area days in future y2095 implying a significantly high exposure of benthic and near bed pelagic species to hypoxic waters also the near bed area with hypoxic water is expected to increase by 16 relative to the total area of the salish sea in future y2095 as per model predictions similarly a combination of reduced ph of incoming oceanic water 0 36 units with an increase in pco2 levels from 364 μatm for y2000 to 877 μatm projected for y2095 scenario results in significant increase in exposure to more acidic waters results presented here in the form of aragonite saturation state ωa indicate that bottom layer of salish sea could be exposed to low ph waters with ωa 1 100 of the time in y2095 for the bottom layer which already experiences exposure to corrosive water in present condition this represents an increase of 20 however for the surface waters including the photic zone the projection for the future y2095 scenario represents a near doubling over 114 increase in exposure to waters with ωa 1 it is important to note that the results highlight the mitigation benefit provided by biogeochemical activity from algal growth eelgrass and circulation in preventing 100 exposure to waters with ωa 1 in the future a similar benefit is also experienced by the salish sea environment relative to hypoxia exposure the simulated future response provides an important insight in that perturbations in the form of increased temperature and higher nutrient levels in the system will propagate through the trophic levels in a manner that cannot be estimated through educated guesses the responses to climate perturbations were counterintuitive and will likely differ based on site and estuary specific differences in circulation and loading characteristics in the salish sea domain the effect of anticipated increase in primary production was transmitted almost entirely to upper trophic level resulting in negligible change in algal biomass instead significant 13 and 25 increases in micro and mesozooplankton biomass levels respectively was projected similarly the model results point to nearly a 50 loss of eelgrass biomass in the future it is possible that these results may be artifacts of current eelgrass module parameterization that renders it overly sensitive to temperature salinity and light and will likely be updated in the future as more in field data from eelgrass meadows become available presence of eelgrass does show anticipated improvements to local do and ph levels at locations with significant eelgrass meadows but the results are qualitative and further model improvement site specific calibration for water column interaction is needed for quantitative

24671,future projections based on the ipcc high emissions scenario rcp8 5 have previously shown that the pacific northwest coastal waters will be subjected to altered ocean states in the upwelled shelf waters resulting in higher primary productivity and increased regions of hypoxia and acidification in the inner estuarine waters such as the salish sea however corresponding effects on the lower trophic levels and submerged aquatic vegetation have not yet been quantified supported by new synoptic field data explicit coupled simulation of algae zooplankton and eelgrass biomass was accomplished for the first time in the salish sea we re applied the improved model to evaluate future ecological response and examined potential algal species shift but with the effects of zooplankton production metabolism and predation prey interactions included we also evaluated the role of eelgrass with respect to potential for improvements to dissolved oxygen and ph levels and as a mitigation measure against hypoxia and ocean acidification the results re confirm the possibility that there could be a substantial area days increase 52 fold in exposure of benthic and near bed pelagic species to hypoxic waters in 2095 the projections for ocean acidification similarly indicate 20 114 increase in exposure to lower ph corrosive waters with aragonite saturation state ωa 1 importantly projected increase in primary productivity was shown to propagate to higher trophic levels with 13 and 25 increases in micro and mesozooplankton biomass levels however the preliminary results also point to sensitivity of the eelgrass model to environmental stressor and potential loss eelgrass biomass in the future keywords climate change ocean acidification salish sea biophysical model phytoplankton eelgrass zooplankton 1 introduction global warming and sea level rise are the two direct consequences of anthropogenically induced climate change that are considered generally well understood and have gained broad recognition per recent projections presented by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc fifth assessment report ipcc 2014 ipcc 2018 an unchecked increase in greenhouse gas emissions is projected to increase global mean temperature by 2 6 c 4 8 c by the end of the 21st century 2081 2100 relative to year 2000 y2000 1986 2005 associated impacts such as melting of the glaciers and warming water temperatures will likely result in global mean sea level rise of 0 45 0 82 m similarly projections for the 2090s based on the earth system model simulations for the unchecked high emissions future scenario ipcc s representative concentration pathway scenario rcp8 5 indicate a global average increase in sea surface temperature 2 73 0 72 c a reduction in sea surface ph 0 33 0 003 and a reduction in global oxygen content 0 19 mg l 0 024 relative to the 1990s bopp et al 2013 however projected impacts are not uniform and can vary significantly based on geographic location and site specific conditions for example a worst case scenario sea level rise of 1 5 m projected for y2100 relative to y2000 based on the sea level change curve calculator version 2015 46 developed by the u s army corps of engineers huber and white 2015 for the pacific northwest u s coastal waters neah bay washington is nearly double the global projection similarly predicted dissolved oxygen do depletion for the subsurface waters of the continental slope 200 600 m that upwell on to the shelf along the oregon washington coastline of the u s 1 6 mg l is nearly an order of magnitude higher than the global mean projection bopp et al 2013 cocco et al 2013 this is of major concern for the ecosystems in the pacific northwest with numerous tide flats marshes and eelgrass zostera marina l beds that support habitats for thousands of fish and wildlife species which in turn are vital to the regional economy culture and quality of life these habitats are present in the large and complex estuarine reaches within the salish sea which includes puget sound the strait of juan de fuca and strait of georgia sub basins in u s and canadian waters see fig 1 there is therefore a growing urgency to improve our understanding of the vulnerability or resilience of these coastal waters and estuaries to stressors associated with climate change and future oceanic conditions an expected consequence of sea level rise is that the coastal marsh habitats will be affected higher temperatures will likely make harmful algal blooms more frequent and coupled with ocean acidification toxicity associated with some of the blooms may increase mauger et al 2015 moore et al 2011 2015 marine ecosystems will likely be impacted by the combined effects of the above stressors and changes to water quality and chemistry for example will likely affect species such as shellfish and salmon negatively understanding whether and how environmental conditions may impact food web structure is central to our ability to predict how food webs will respond to climate change gilbert 2019 there is much interest therefore in reproducing lowest trophic levels of the food web micro and meso zooplankton in the salish sea and quantifying the effects of climate change projections on the building blocks for use by the community for complex higher trophic level food web assessments although it is possible that some species such as submerged as eelgrass however could benefit from increased co2 and tolerate moderate temperature increases sustained high temperature and high salinity levels can also be a stressor to eelgrass waldbusser et al 2015 barton et al 2012 mantua et al 2010 sharma and liermann 2010 thom 1996 without site specific downscaling and modeling to account for physical processes such as circulation upwelling exchange processes and changes to local stream flows and pollutant nutrient loads the biogeochemical and ecological projections and expectations remain qualitative judgements and are somewhat inconclusive in terms of quantifying the severity and magnitude of projected impacts to the nearshore estuarine ecosystems khangaonkar et al 2019 examined future biogeochemical response within salish sea puget sound washington usa and georgia strait british columbia canada using the salish sea model khangaonkar et al 2018 driven by downscaled outputs from the national center for atmospheric research climate model community earth system model a single projection of 95 year change under the rcp8 5 high greenhouse gas emissions scenario was simulated results indicated that higher water temperatures lower ph and decreased do levels in the upwelled shelf waters in the future would propagate into the salish sea interestingly the results showed that overall circulation mixing and stratification were relatively unaffected by the projected changes in sea level 1 5 m meteorological forcing and hydrology the projected changes in ocean states over the continental shelf propagated into the salish sea resulted in an increase in average salish sea temperature 1 51 c a decrease in do 0 77 mg l and a ph reduction acidification 0 18 units in y2095 relative to historical y2000 the results also showed that algal biomass in the salish sea could increase by 23 with a potential shift from communities dominated by diatoms to ones dominated by dinoflagellates this particular result includes much uncertainty due to inherent simplifications one of the simplifications was that zooplankton were not simulated explicitly but the effects were included through a constant predation term composition of the zooplankton varies around puget sound influenced by many factors including river flow distance from the ocean depth temperature prey and predation copepods are the most abundant and typically the highest biomass taxonomic group but many other crustacean zooplankton e g euphausiids amphipods barnacle crab and shrimp larvae are important as are several species of gelatinous zooplankton including large cnidarian medusae the species composition is dominated by resident taxa but coastal upwelling associated taxa are seasonally advected into northern regions of the sound seasonal cycles also vary spatially with biomass peaking generally in june august in most regions and up to a month earlier in warmer southern regions interannual variability is less well known but seems to be associated with temperature and chlorophyll biomass keister et al 2019 another simplification was that while the model included a comprehensive sediment water interaction module it did not include submerged aquatic vegetation sav and associated nutrient and carbon source and sink mechanisms benthic aquatic primary producers such as sav are critical to nearshore ecosystems and food webs eelgrass in the salish sea in particular is widely recognized for its important ecological functions and is a valuable indicator of ecosystem health inclusion of benthic primary production from eelgrass on scales relevant to nearshore shellfish beds is of much interest as it is known to influence nearshore water chemistry including nutrient levels dissolved inorganic carbon dic concentrations and ph tejeda 2014 eelgrass is also being looked at as a potential mitigation measure to combat ocean acidification at a local level via carbon sequestration greiner et al 2013 washington state blue ribbon panel on ocean acidification 2012 benthic primary production may also provide benefits to nutrient pollution management related to hypoxia and low do levels in this paper supported by new synoptic field data from year 2014 we present a first fully coupled reproduction of observed biogeochemical interaction between phytoplankton zooplankton and eelgrass in the salish sea using an updated version of the salish sea model as part of this effort the salish sea model kinetics for do ph calibration were first improved by fine tuning the re aeration routine and algal kinetic parameters sav and zooplankton modules were then added and the model was re calibrated only one species of sav eelgrass zostera marina l was simulated the model was then applied to simulate biogeochemical cycles in the salish sea with ecological interactions between phytoplankton zooplankton and eelgrass simulated explicitly for the historical condition represented by y2000 and compared with a future projection for y2095 also included in this paper are the results of an eelgrass sensitivity test that provides a screening level assessment of potential effects of eelgrass presence on mitigating ocean acidification on a local as well as salish sea wide scale 2 methods the salish sea model solves reynolds averaged navier stokes equations for turbulent flows with the boussinesq approximation in an integral form by computing fluxes between non overlapping horizontal triangular control volumes the model simulates water surface elevation velocity temperature salinity sediment and water quality constituents forced by river and wastewater inflows tides and meteorological drivers such as wind and solar radiation fig 1 upper left panel shows the model domain which encompasses vancouver island completely allowing tides to propagate into the salish sea around vancouver island through johnstone strait and the strait of juan de fuca the hydrodynamic component of the salish sea model uses the finite volume community ocean model fvcom chen et al 2003 with an unstructured grid framework and has been discussed in detail previously khangaonkar et al 2011 2017 2018 the biogeochemical component of the salish sea model is based on ce qual icm a three dimensional time variable integrated compartment model cerco and cole 1994 cerco et al 1995 for application to the salish sea an offline approach of coupling fvcom to ce qual icm was used the approach was developed by kim and khangaonkar 2012 in collaboration with the university of massachusetts dartmouth resulting in the fvcom icm code the baseline biogeochemical model includes 23 state variables temperature salinity two species of phytoplankton diatoms p1 and dinoflagellates p2 labile and refractory dissolved organic carbon doc and particulate organic carbon nh4 nitrate no2 no3 labile and refractory dissolved organic nitrogen and particulate organic nitrogen po4 labile and refractory dissolved organic phosphorous do dic and total alkalinity ta the model includes a sediment diagenesis module that allows directly coupled interaction between the water column and sediments through the processes of organic sediment settling and burial and remineralization and carbonate chemistry with dic ta pco2 and ph khangaonkar et al 2018 2019 bianucci et al 2018 fig 2 provides a schematic representation of the biogeochemical components of the fvcom icm v4 0 one of the challenges of simulating do and hypoxia in the salish sea has been simultaneously achieving satisfactory calibration with dic and ph variables through numerous sensitivity tests reaeration was identified as a key parameter requiring improvement as it affects both do and dic in the surface layers and impacts biogeochemical response the reaeration rate is proportional to the dissolved gas deficit relative to its saturation state t d g k r δ z d g s d g where dg is the dissolved gas concentration mg l d g s is the saturation concentration in water and δ z is the model layer thickness the reaeration coefficient kr also known as reaeration velocity specified in the units of m d 1 is a function of wind speed w m s 1 and is given by 1 k r 0 251 w 2 therefore an empirical coefficient has the units m d 1 m s 1 2 as part of this effort to improve model skill we tested two different formulations for α 0 54 0 0233t 0 002s per hartman and hammond 1985 α 0 24 sc 660 0 5 per wanninkhof 2014 s and t are salinity and temperature while sc is the schmidt number ratio of momentum diffusivity kinematic viscosity and molecular diffusion in the high energy fjord like waters of the salish sea the re aeration provided by the wanninkhof 2014 method during the winter months with minimal primary production and photosynthesis was insufficient to match the observed do levels the hartman and hammond 1985 approach provided the required re aeration in the winter but adversely affected the biogeochemical response with excessive re aeration levels during the summer months the reduced primary production in the summer resulted in lower particulate organic matter pom lower doc and affected ph predictions for improved year round do and ph predictions the fall and winter month oct nov dec jan feb mar reaeration was simulated using the hartman and hammond 1985 formulation and the spring and summer months apr may jun jul aug sep were simulated using wanninkopf 2014 however following this update to re aeration formulation it became clear that the previously established photosynthetic rate was likely set too high using do ph and algal biomass as indicators it was determined that primary productivity and subsequent generation of pom and its mineralization was too high the model performance improved considerably when maximum photosynthetic rates for diatom and dinoflagellates were reduced from the upper range limit of 350 to a mid range value 250 g c g 1 chl d 1 the above improvements in reaeration reduction in maximum photosynthetic rates and minor tuning of other phytoplankton kinetic parameters allowed year round harmonization of do and ph predictions with domain wide rmses of 0 94 mg l and 0 14 units respectively 2 1 light availability the ability to account for heterogeneity induced by turbidity plumes and light availability during periods of high river flows was particularly important for this effort given the interest in simulation of distributed eelgrass beds around the salish sea shoreline that are sensitive to available light to account for these turbidity plumes and incorporate their impact on light availability or irradiance distribution inorganic suspended sediments iss were added to the biogeochemical model and calibrated using a combination of available measurements of turbidity irradiance as photosynthetically available radiation and aerial observations the details of irradiance calculation can be found in cerco and moore 2001 cerco et al 2002 2010 turbidity is a function of total suspended solids concentration which is computed within the model as a result of loading settling and resuspension processes total suspended sediment loads for the rivers and runoff streams were estimated using rating curves developed by the u s geological survey usgs for their respective watersheds fig 3 shows an example plot of comparison of predicted turbidity and measured data at selected sites in the main basin of puget sound and sub basins such as hood canal and possession sound with and without iss 2 2 zooplankton biomass in the salish sea micro and mesozooplankton simulation in prior efforts with fvcom icm in the salish sea the zooplankton effect on phytoplankton was considered implicitly through a predation term khangaonkar et al 2012 2018 2019 bianucci et al 2018 in this effort zooplankton were incorporated explicitly with microzooplankton and mesozooplankton groups each individual micro and meso group represents a spectrum of species the mathematical approach and the formulation of zooplankton kinetics were adopted from cerco and noel 2004 and have been previously applied to chesapeake bay and lake erie using fvcom icm by other researchers xia et al 2016 jiang et al 2015 in the zooplankton module microzooplankton are set as the primary predators of the phytoplankton as the secondary predators mesozooplankton are formulated to consume microzooplankton however a fraction of phytoplankton biomass is also consumed by mesozooplankton as some species tend to consume phytoplankton at their early stages of physiology or depending on seasonal food abundance and preference el sabaawi et al 2010 as shown in fig 2 carbon and nutrients consumed by zooplankton through grazing on phytoplankton and detritus are returned into the available nutrients and detritus pools through respiration and mortality in this simplified formulation zooplankton abundance is driven primarily by prey availability transport is passive and motility or vertical migration is not considered although the microzooplankton and mesozooplankton groups have the same mathematical form for the production each individual group has distinct parameterization for each term in the zooplankton production eq 2 below to reflect the group specific kinetics 2 d z y d t g z y b m z y m z y z y p r z y where z y zooplankton

function of temperature by adopting the simplified approach in cerco and noel 2004 both zooplankton groups are subject to mortality at low do concentrations we assume that the mortality does not occur until the do reaches a threshold value which depends on the type of species and other environmental conditions we have set that value at the 2 mg l definition of hypoxia predation on zooplankton is simulated as a function of zooplankton and predator biomass which is assumed proportional to zooplankton prey biomass for a detailed description of zooplankton kinetic equations used in fvcom icm see cerco and noel 2004 2 3 eelgrass simulation through submerged aquatic vegetation module eelgrass occurs throughout puget sound within the photic zone the distribution of the plant is generally limited by light at the lower depth limit thom et al 2008 and by exposure and wave energy at the upper edge thom et al 2014b eelgrass is found to depths of 3 to 7 m mllw in most of puget sound but extends to 10 m in the san juan islands and the strait of juan de fuca christiaen et al 2019 other limiting factors for eelgrass include substrate type temperature and salinity thom et al 2001 thom et al 2003 thom et al 2014b nutrients n and p are important for eelgrass growth however nutrients may not be limiting in puget sound yang et al 2013 eelgrass size biomass and density vary spatially and temporally thom et al 2003 thom et al 2014b in general size is negatively correlated with density yang et al 2013 with density decreasing with increasing depth thom et al 2008 and total above ground biomass per unit area remains relatively constant olesen and sand jensen 1994 eelgrass in fvcom icm was incorporated through the sav model based on the formulation and implementation in the ce qual icm model studies of chesapeake bay cerco and moore 2001 cerco et al 2002 2010 the sav model has five state variables four of which represent plant components a leaves the photosynthetic portions of the above ground plant biomass lf g c m 2 b stems the structural non photosynthetic portions of the above ground plant biomass st g c m 2 c roots the below ground portions of the plant biomass associated with anchoring the plant and with nutrient uptake rt g c m 2 d tubers or rhizomes the below ground organs associated with propagation and with energy storage in the model rhizomes

column interactions is described in the 2010 chesapeake bay eutrophication model report cerco et al 2010 and is not reproduced here 2 4 evaluation of model s baseline performance and overview of model experiments the salish sea model setup for baseline performance assessment presented here is based on y2014 conditions it uses procedures identical to those described previously by khangaonkar et al 2018 the model is forced with daily values of freshwater inflow from a total of 68 watersheds including 34 major rivers and 99 wastewater discharges the biogeochemical component of the model includes daily concentrations of nutrient and water quality constituent loads estimated using a combination of hydrological and multiple regression analyses based on monitoring data mohamedali et al 2011 temperature t and salinity s profiles at the ocean boundary were obtained from the hycom model from nodes over the continental shelf and interpolated to the model ocean boundary ocean boundary values for most water quality variables were set based on available climatological data from a combination of world ocean atlas and department of fisheries and oceans canada monitoring database with the exception of do nitrate ta and dic variables that were specified using regressions to salinity developed by the university of washington uw personal communication from ryan mccabe and parker maccready of uw the addition of explicit predation by micro and mesozooplankton required adjustment of some of the algal kinetics parameters to ensure model error statistics and skill were not compromised a part of algal predation is now done explicitly through the zooplankton module therefore it was necessary to reduce the base predation rate specified in the phytoplankton module to allow for direct grazing by zooplankton this was done through iterative calibration tests in which the background predation was reduced in steps from its original value of 1 0 d 1 until reasonable match for algal biomass was obtained resulting in a background predation rate of 0 5 d 1 the base predation rate although reduced accounts for mortality and predation from causes beyond direct consumption by micro and mesozooplankton the addition of zooplankton also altered the temporal response of the model and caused the phytoplankton peaks to occur earlier in the year the zooplankton biomass is typically low early in the year with reduced base predation and without zooplankton grazing the diatom growth was initiated and peaked nearly a month earlier than observed the summer growth of dinoflagellates also occurred sooner than expected and did not last through the end of summer to retain the model skill in matching diatom and dinoflagellate peak growth and die off timing as observed the optimum temperature for the growth of diatoms tmp1 was increased from 12 c to 14 c and the optimum temperature for the growth of dinoflagellates tmp2 was increased from 18 c to 20 c this adjustment is within desirable range of temperatures for diatom growth of 10 c 18 c montagnes and franklin 2001 zhang et al 2018 and 15 c 25 c for dinoflagellates growth souza et al 2014 boyd et al 2013 overall model performance was evaluated using error statistics such as absolute mean error ame or mean error me to assess bias and root mean square error rmse the ame and rmse of time series with n elements are defined as follows 12 a m e 1 n x mdl x obs 13 r m s e x mdl x obs 2 n where x mdl and x obs are the values from the model and observations respectively to assess model skill we computed the willmott skill score wss willmott 1982 defined as 14 w s s 1 x mdl x obs 2 x mdl x obs x obs x obs 2 where an overbar represents a time average the wss is a measure of the level of agreement between the observed and modeled values a value of 1 indicates perfect agreement and a value of 0 indicates no agreement model recalibration and validation for this update of the salish sea model was conducted for y2014 using the same data set consisting of monthly profiles from 24 water quality stations maintained by washington state department of ecology ecology and shown in fig 1 we then revisited a model experiment designed to assess future biogeochemical response in inner salish sea water khangaonkar et al 2019 but this time with an improved model including the complex effects of phytoplankton zooplankton and eelgrass biogeochemical interactions recent future climate predictions ipcc fifth assessment including downscaled hydrology and meteorology from a single ensemble member from cmip5 gcm climate model and multiple ensembles members of ocean states from the cesm le ocean model were available for the pacific northwest and were used to set up historical and future scenarios the approach selected was to use this single available projection for the high emissions rcp8 5 scenario with an arbitrary ocean state ensemble average and focus on the projected difference between climatological conditions defined as 1 historical y2000 temporal average of years 1995 2004 the last 10 years of available historical predictions and 2 future y2095 conditions temporal average of 2090 2100 the last 10 years of available future predictions the approach of averaging inputs over 10 year windows was to minimize the effects of interannual variability and limitations of running a specific year from a single member from the ensemble therefore two salish sea model simulations were conducted using inputs derived from downscaled cesm products 1 historical y2000 simulation and 2 future y2095 simulation the approach selected was to treat y2000 and y2095 simulations as perturbation tests using the previously calibrated setup from 2014 in other words y2000 and y2095 simulations were conducted by replacing the river ocean boundary and meteorological inputs and retaining all other model parameters at the previously calibrated y2014 values 3 results 3 1 model validation and skill table 1 lists

example to compare simulated surface and bottom layer concentrations of chlorophyll a do nitrate and ph with monthly monitoring data fig 4 the upper layer in the salish sea model occupies 3 of the

observations for ta dic and ph variables left panel and an example comparison of profiles from a representative puget sound station right panel zooplankton model setup and validation relied on two sets of data only limited historical microzooplankton data were available from the neah bay location near the entrance to the salish sea from the ecology and oceanography of harmful algal blooms pacific northwest project ecohab pnw lessard 2009 mesozooplankton data from 2014 were available from king county s zooplankton monitoring program conducted in collaboration with long live the kings and uw who collect zooplankton samples at three locations in puget sound twice monthly february november and once monthly december january keister et al 2017 the mesozooplankton data were also used first to ensure that initiation of growth and timing of the peak were reasonably similar to observed data but most importantly they were used to provide closure for the zooplankton model through the predation term initial setup of model was based on literature based values that were adjusted to best reproduce observed behavior from puget sound addition of zooplankton kinetics significantly increased the oxygen demand from water column respiration and pom production and decay and affected do dic and ph levels the final selection of parameter values required adjustment of prey utilization fractions e g 100 utilization of phytoplankton by microzooplankton and 30 utilization respectively of phytoplankton and microzooplankton by mesozooplankton efficiency of grazing 0 3 for each group and

compares predicted mesozooplankton biomass plots with data from the three king county monitoring program puget sound stations the model predictions match observed data reasonably well at the point williams and point jefferson stations but appear to overpredict the biomass at the east passage station also shown is a qualitative comparison with available microzooplankton data from the ecohab pnw neah bay station the microzooplankton data plotted in fig 6 include all available data from prior years which served as a qualitative guide to manage the model response characteristics such as timing of growth initiation peak biomass and reduction die off among others the eelgrass model developed here primarily ensures that the salish sea model computations properly account for associated biogeochemical process resulting in carbon do and nutrient fluxes along the shoreline and shallow embayments with existing healthy eelgrass meadows this intermediate scale version of the salish sea model does not include intertidal flats and is built with bathymetry that is smoothed resulting deeper depths along the shoreline to overcome this limitation and to simulate eelgrass with reasonable accuracy the model uses a sub grid nodes identified with eelgrass present for simulation where eelgrass growth is allowed to occur accurate and unsmoothed site specific depth is provided for use in eelgrass related calculations in particular for estimating submergence depth for light attenuation at the eelgrass nodes initial conditions that describe the state of eelgrass vegetation in the domain at the start of simulation were specified based on available abundance maps developed by the washington state department of natural resources wdnr dowty et al 2017 while considerable data on spatial coverage and delineation of eelgrass beds exist eelgrass biomass time series data from puget sound are very limited wdnr collected above ground and below ground eelgrass biomass data from the dumas bay site in puget sound in 2014 these were averaged and used nominally to specify initial biomass at all locations of 10 g c m 2 for leaf and root while 5 g c m 2 were used as the initial condition for stem and rhizomes tuber respectively also available from the same site were eelgrass biomass data collected by thom and albright 1990 the combined dataset was used in the calibration process of adjusting the parameters and model response to best reproduce observed above ground and below ground eelgrass biomass table 3 lists the major eelgrass kinetic parameters selected as part of this validation effort to y2014 data fig 7 shows a timeseries plot of predicted eelgrass biomass and available field data from dumas bay also presented is a plan view contour plot of predicted eelgrass biomass for july of 2014 table 4 provides model error statistics me rmse and wss values for characterization of model skill for key variables of interest model skill is the highest for t s nitrate do and ph due to limited data available from 2014 validation of the model zooplankton and sav was qualitative and quantitative skill assessment was not conducted with the upgrades and revision of calibration the model provides improved performance with the model achieving a desired level of skill for do rmse 0 92 mg l and ph rmse 0 14 simultaneously with zooplankton and sav interactions included 3 2 projected change in salish sea y2095 relative to y2000 inputs to the salish sea model corresponding to future y2095 climate scenario rcp8 5 based on cesm simulations are summarized schematically in fig 8 these the future changes in nutrients ph and do in the northeast pacific were derived previously and are described in detail along with supporting justification in khangaonkar et al 2019 in general as a result of global warming temperatures over the continental shelf air and sea surfaces and river discharges are all warmer by 2 4 c based on sea level change curve calculator version 2015 46 developed by the u s army corps of engineers huber and white 2015 the worst case impact estimate for neah bay washington located at the strait of juan de fuca entrance to the salish sea is 1 5 m although future wastewater flow magnitudes are higher freshwater inflows from gaged rivers and nonpoint source runoff are predicted to be lower by 4 7 relative to historical y2000 flows khangaonkar et al 2019 have previously shown that the impact of sea level rise on overall circulation in the salish sea is relatively small a possible explanation for this finding is that the 1 5 m mean sea level change in this fjord represents only a small relative depth change δh 0 013 based on average depth of the salish sea of 113 m the effect on increased circulation strength is likely counteracted by the effects of reduced salinity gradients ocean chemistry is predicted to change as well the salish sea also is expected to experience a higher concentration of nutrient loads from the ocean boundary river mouths and wastewater treatment plants the incoming estuarine exchange flow from the pacific ocean is predicted to be lower in do by 1 7 mg l for the future rcp8 5 scenario note that the ocean boundary change values in fig 8 are based on an average of only three arbitrarily selected members from the cmip5 ensemble initial conditions for physical and biogeochemical states were set up using climatological data and subjected to a 1 year spin up the model was then restarted using the warmed up conditions and the simulation was repeated this approach was used for the historical as well as future runs evolution of natural biological systems could take over 100 years a complex timeseries prediction of salish sea ecosystem over a 100 year time frame is not attempted here instead we focus on simulating a typical one year cycle using historical y2000 conditions and comparing it with the response for an equivalent year in the future projection of y2095 conditions the approach is based on an understanding that biogeochemical cycles within the salish sea are controlled by flushing time of the estuary which is 1 year the spin up of 1 year from uniform initial conditions cold start has shown to successfully generate estuary wide gradients to conduct a hot start simulation using end of the cold start year as the initial condition 3 2 1 phytoplankton and zooplankton as shown in fig 8 nutrient loads from oceanic and land based sources are expected to increase in the future y2095 rcp8 5 scenario relative to historical levels a 6 higher concentration of no2 no3 in the tidally averaged estuarine inflow from the pacific ocean 44 increase in no2 no3 loads from rivers and near doubling of wastewater inflows result in higher availability of no2 no3 in the euphotic zone in combination with higher surface temperatures a significant increase in algal biomass in the future was predicted previously khangaonkar et al 2019 however in this assessment with the explicit inclusion of zooplankton and eelgrass kinetics the results were different fig 9 shows comparisons of predicted nitrate and algal biomass in the euphotic zone for the historical y2000 and future y2095 despite a 16 increase in euphotic zone nitrate mass in future y2095 the predicted change in algal biomass 0 05 in future y2095 is negligible and is in contrast with the previous prediction of 23 0 increase in algal biomass in future y2095 as reported in khangaonkar et al 2019 here we find that increase in future primary production and algal growth results in higher prey availability along with a corresponding zooplankton response increase in dynamic predation by the zooplankton community is reflected in an average 13 increase of microzooplankton and an 25 increase of mesozooplankton biomass in future y2095 as shown in time series of predicted nitrate algae and zooplankton biomass in the upper 30 m euphotic zone in fig 9 both zooplankton species were set to grow at the same optimum temperature of 20 c but a higher increase in biomass is predicted for mesozooplankton compared to microzooplankton this is likely due to the microzooplankton being set up to prey primarily on algae while mesozooplankton have a higher diversity of prey available through consumption of microzooplankton and algae this is reasonable considering that more than 50 of the mesozooplankton group is composed of crustacean species like copepods which have a diverse diet in addition to consuming microzooplankton and dinoflagellates olson and strom 2002 it is noted however that these predictions of higher zooplankton in the future are based on a constant rate of predation on zooplankton by higher tropic levels 3 2 2 eelgrass biomass projections of future climate effects on eelgrass are of interest given the community wide desire to increase eelgrass biomass in puget sound as part of restoration efforts thom et al 2014a thom et al 2018 the restoration of eelgrass as a critical ecosystem component and indicator of environmental health is a high priority in washington state s puget sound where the goal is to increase the current eelgrass coverage by 20 i e 4000 ha it is expected that in the future with higher sea level some of the eelgrass may be lost due to submergence beyond critical depths but in this assessment we elected to exclude the sea level rise effect under the assumption that there will be new area available for eelgrass migration to higher ground however eelgrass could also be impacted by light availability ralph et al 2007 mcglathery 2001 and temperature effects jarvis et al 2014 fig 10 a shows predicted domain wide total average eelgrass biomass for the historical y2000 and future y2095 scenarios the eelgrass biomass evaluated here only includes the leaves and stem parts of the plants for above ground portion and roots and rhizomes for the below ground portion as shown in fig 10 a the results point to the possibility that there could be a significant reduction 48 in average annual eelgrass biomass for the future y2095 scenario relative to y2000 biomass these results are contrary to expectation and require a careful review exposure to upwelled water with higher levels of dic in the future y2095 scenario were expected to provide a beneficial effect and result in increased eelgrass growth a plausible explanation is that increased nutrients lead to increased primary productivity which reduces light availability and decreases eelgrass consistent with zimmerman et al 1987 and yang et al 2013 the eelgrass growth rate is also extremely sensitivity to temperature and salinity levels a closer examination of fig 10 b shows that major eelgrass losses are predicted to occur in the larger eelgrass meadows near intertidal embayments such as padilla bay bellingham bay skagit bay port susan bay stillaguamish river port gardner snohomish river and nisqually reach as opposed to the eelgrass beds along the shorelines these areas are subject to maximum changes in temperature and salinity under the future scenarios and the associated limitations on growth dominate over the benefits of higher levels of nutrients and dic available in the future similarly reduced light availability in the future due to increased primary production and increased levels of suspended sediment and poc concentration in the water column likely contributed to this result 3 2 3 hypoxia and acidification typical do levels in the surface waters are high in the salish sea due to the large number of freshwater runoffs with high do re aeration the relatively cool temperatures of the water surface for a significant period of the year and healthy levels of primary production and photosynthesis however the salish sea water surface is expected to experience a temperature increase of 1 5 c in future y2095 according to the rcp8 5 scenario khangaonkar et al 2019 despite this the dominant effect of re aeration and the resulting do from increased primary production maintains a high level of do 8 12 mg l in the surface layers in contrast to the euphotic zone the near bed waters undergo a reduction in do due to the combined effects of upwelling respiration decay mineralization and sediment oxygen demand from settling and decomposition of organic matter from algae zooplankton and eelgrass origins this reduction of do leads to hypoxia do 2 mg l conditions in waters at near bed which threatens the benthic and near bed pelagic marine ecosystem the future climate change y2095 has the potential to exacerbate the hypoxia condition in near bed waters with the increasing nutrient levels according to rcp8 5 scenario fig 11 compares hypoxic exposure at near bed in the salish sea for the projected future y2095 and historical y2000 scenarios in the context of hypoxic area days as shown in the figure there is a substantial increase 52 fold in hypoxic area days in future y2095 implying a significantly high exposure of benthic and near bed pelagic species to hypoxic waters also the near bed area with hypoxic water is expected to be increased by 16 relative to the total area of the salish sea in future y2095 as per model predictions the ph levels of the salish sea are significantly influenced by the low ph levels in the upwelled water over the continental shelf that enters the system through the bottom layer exchange bianucci et al 2018 also highlighted the importance of low ph water from land based fresh water sources i e rivers algae growth and dic consumption during the summer increase ph levels in the surface however decay of the poc generated through algal predation excretion die off and dic generated through metabolism and respiration draws ph and do levels down in the water column reaching lowest levels during late spring in the future y2095 scenario the results are dominated by the reduction in ph of incoming oceanic water by nearly 0 36 units this in combination with an increase in pco2 levels from 364 μatm for y2000 to 877 μatm for y2095 the future scenario results in significant increase in exposure to more acidic waters results are presented in the form of aragonite saturation state ωa defined as ω a c a 2 c o 3 2 c a c o 3 where dissolved calcium ca2 is the seawater concentration of dissolved calcium ions co3 2 is the seawater concentration of carbonate ions caco3 is the solubility of aragonite in seawater and ω is the calculated saturation state of seawater seawater with low ph also has low aragonite saturation state ωa aragonite is the least stable form of calcium carbonate formed by many shell building organisms and its saturation state indicates whether aragonite tends to precipitate ωa 1 or dissolve ωa 1 ωa levels below 1 are of concern as this indicates conditions unsuitable for calcifying organisms to build shells which could result in a cascade of impacts to the food web fig 12 top panels shows contour plots of exposure to seawater in days with ωa 1 for the y2000 conditions for the surface and the bottom layers in the strait of juan de fuca and puget sound regions of interest results show that most regions experience some days during which ωa 1 during the winter season most regions experience ωa levels that are 1 in the surface as well as bottom waters the phytoplankton growth during the summer helps raise ph levels in the photic zone through uptake of dic which helps increase ωa levels in the surface waters vertical circulation cells in the system described in khangaonkar et al 2017 2018 then help mix higher ωa waters from the surface to the lower layers improving the ph and ωa levels relative to the low levels in the incoming upwelled shelf waters the results show that for y2000 in the summer months of may june and july 30 40 of near bed water has ωa 1 and is likely supportive of shell forming organisms however in some sub basins such as hood canal bottom layer ωa levels are 1 throughout the year these simulation results for y2000 scenario match the present ωa conditions in salish sea described by several researchers eg feeley et al 2010 feeley et al 2012 and pelletier et al 2018 fig 12 bottom panels show projections for the y2095 scenario results point to the possibility that bottom layer of salish sea will be exposed to low ph waters with ωa 1 100 of the time bottom right for the bottom layer this represents an increase in exposure to corrosive water of 20 however for the surface waters including the photic zone the projection for the future y2095 scenario represents a near doubling over 114 increase in exposure to waters with ωa 1 4 discussion the primary objective of this study was to revisit the projections of biogeochemical response of the salish sea environment given changing oceanic states due to climate change effects and population growth but with due consideration to interaction with lower trophic levels i e zooplankton kinetics and water column interaction with sav in the form of eelgrass the model results were prepared for comparison of historical conditions for y2000 with the future conditions for y2095 based on the rcp8 5 emissions scenario response of the planktonic community eelgrass growth and exposure to hypoxia and ocean acidification were examined this was feasible in part due to recent data collection effort related to zooplankton and eelgrass by ecology wdnr and uw availability of this data facilitated improvements to the salish sea model kinetics through incorporation of turbidity zooplankton and eelgrass and a recalibration effort resulting in domain wide harmonization of calibration parameters and rmse of 0 92 mg l for do and 0 14 units for ph the results show that changing oceanic and meteorological conditions will result in perturbations to the biogeochemical cycles that are likely to propagate all the way through the food web prior results limited to primary producers projected a significant increase in phytoplankton biomass this has now been superseded by the results here that show a corresponding increase in predation of phytoplankton biomass by zooplankton but that algal biomass is maintained at levels comparable to the present the zooplankton growth for y2095 conditions is projected to increase by 13 25 for micro and mesozooplankton respectively however it is noted that this predicted increase in zooplankton is also affected by lack of connection to higher trophic levels and other simplifying assumptions in the zooplankton kinetic processes the current version of the zooplankton kinetic model does not include the active transport by diel vertical migration which is a vital zooplankton mediated carbon transport mechanism there is a significant impact from diel vertical migration on carbon based detritus pools i e poc and dissolved carbon doc which has an indirect influence on phytoplankton growth further fvcom icm is a carbon based model that transports carbon biomass to the upper food web making zooplankton growth sensitive to the prey availability over other ecological and physiological factors in the epipelagic environment therefore these model predictions related to increase of zooplankton growth in future y2095 should not be conclusively interpreted as an increase in prey availability for species in the upper pelagic food web in contrast to predicted increase for zooplankton the y2095 scenario simulations for eelgrass showed that annual average production of eelgrass biomass would be reduced by nearly 50 the reduction of eelgrass biomass for future conditions is attributed to increased temperature increased salinity and reduced light availability in the shallow nearshore environments in the future the parameterization of eelgrass growth in the current version of the model is highly sensitive to temperature salinity and light availability further the current eelgrass model lacks kinetics related to processes such as reproduction and active spreading light attenuation due to shadowing effect by the leaves and ammonia toxicity on growth among others additionally the effects of changes in nutrients on macroalgae were not examined research has shown that increases in nutrients can result in excessive growth of green algae ulvoids in puget sound van alstyne 2016 which can compete with or bury eelgrass these model features will be implemented in an upgraded version of the kinetic model together with a robust parameterization supported by more detailed observations despite these limitations the results were retained to guide to future actions as assessing the impact of eelgrass on the epipelagic ecosystem is of strategic importance to estuary wide restoration efforts the role of seagrass i e eelgrass in sustainable maintenance of a marine ecosystem has been highlighted in cerco and moore 2001 and baird et al 2016 eelgrass contribution in nutrient uptake and the role of eelgrass as a natural habitat for several marine species for their spawning and growth periods has led the recovery and restoration programs in coastal systems although the eelgrass module is in its early stage of development the results indicate that the magnitude of eelgrass interaction with water column at the larger salish sea or even at sub basin scale is relatively small the water quality of the salish sea is substantially dominated by the large volume fluxes associated with regionwide algal blooms and tidal exchange flows however the influence of eelgrass on site specific improvement of water quality particularly in proximity to eelgrass meadows or local embayments could be significant by providing enhancement of do and ph levels as a simple test case to assess the local impact on water quality of eelgrass growth we studied the water column do and ph variations qualitatively for the scenarios with and without eelgrass modulation for a selected area in padilla bay where an abundance of eelgrass is located during these tests it became clear that the magnitude of water column response was sensitive to eelgrass model parameters that may vary by location for example site specific variation in uptake of nutrients via roots relative to leaves and stems affects the magnitude of water column impact similarly effect of eelgrass on sediment oxygen demand and nutrient fluxes may be affected by site specific substrate conditions in fig 13 a noticeable improvement in do can be seen during the summer period due to eelgrass activities the ph response predicted by the eelgrass was equally encouraging it is noted however that padilla bay site in puget sound supports one of the healthiest eelgrass meadows in the salish sea region a strong effect such as that shown in fig 13 was expected but required adjustment of model parameters for high level of water column interaction that one would expect at padilla bay at other locations along the shorelines dominant effects from other biogeochemical processes poor nutrient supply from the sediments lack of intertidal vertical resolution and bathymetric smoothing along the shoreline could dilute the result diminishing the predicted influence of eelgrass growth on water column variables given that these results are dependent on model parameterization and the lack of site specific data for detailed calibration we have elected to retain these results at a qualitative level for quantitative assessments and more robust predictions with respect to eelgrass improvement in nearshore resolution with the addition of intertidal wetting and drying processes and site specific calibration of water quality parameters in the presence of eelgrass would be required during this salish sea model upgrade there were significant changes to some of the kinetic parameter values relative to prior versions this does not imply that prior versions and associated results are incorrect but that the addition of new modules and formulation upgrades have modified the biogeochemical response of the model and altered the role and influence of some of the parameters for example the modified re aeration formulation improved algal growth during the summer significantly which allowed maximum photosynthetic rates pm1 and pm2 for diatom and dinoflagellates to be reduced from the upper range limit of 350 g c g 1 chl d 1 used previously to a mid range value 250 g c g 1 chl d 1 similarly the addition of explicit predation by zooplankton altered the algal growth response in the model resulting in early diatom growth spurt and overall loss of calibration using new observations of zooplankton biomass and the timing of peak growth as a simulation target diatom and dinoflagellate growth timing was fine tuned allowing them to reach the peak and sustain the growth later in the year this was accomplished by altering the optimum temperature for the growth of diatoms tmp1 from 12 c to 14 c and dinoflagellates tmp2 from 18 c to 20 c but we recognize that field verification is needed through diatom and dinoflagellate monitoring in the salish sea to conclusively determine if the optimum temperatures for algae growth derived indirectly through model calibration reflect site specific conditions accurately similarly it was necessary to reduce the base predation rate specified in the phytoplankton module from 1 d 1 to 0 5 d 1 through iterative tests to account for the newly implemented direct grazing by zooplankton these changes were necessary to ensure the overall algal biomass along with do and ph calibration was reproduced with the same or improved level of accuracy 5 conclusion an improved version of the salish sea model is presented which accounts for the influence of river wash loads on background turbidity and light availability a modified re aeration formulation with seasonal variation and with new modules for explicit simulation of eelgrass and zooplankton the model was recalibrated and achieved regionwide rmse targets for do and ph of 0 92 mg l and 0 14 units simultaneously representing a significant improvement in performance this effort supported by new synoptic meso zooplankton and eelgrass biomass data allowed a first coupled reproduction of observed interaction between phytoplankton growth eelgrass production predation by zooplankton and nutrient consumption from the photic zone in the salish sea the addition of microzooplankton and mesozooplankton along with nutrient source and sink terms associated with eelgrass provides a more sophisticated and complete picture of the salish sea ecosystem up to the lowest trophic levels of the food web in the salish sea the model application for future ocean states and climate conditions provided results that were mostly consistent with those presented in a prior assessment khangaonkar et al 2019 as in the prior effort the results are limited in that they are based on projections from a single ensemble member run of the cesm model however we believe that the results we have developed through this one projection still provide a useful peek into the type of response one may expect over the salish sea in particular the results reconfirmed the projection that there will likely be a substantial increase 52 fold in hypoxic area days in future y2095 implying a significantly high exposure of benthic and near bed pelagic species to hypoxic waters also the near bed area with hypoxic water is expected to increase by 16 relative to the total area of the salish sea in future y2095 as per model predictions similarly a combination of reduced ph of incoming oceanic water 0 36 units with an increase in pco2 levels from 364 μatm for y2000 to 877 μatm projected for y2095 scenario results in significant increase in exposure to more acidic waters results presented here in the form of aragonite saturation state ωa indicate that bottom layer of salish sea could be exposed to low ph waters with ωa 1 100 of the time in y2095 for the bottom layer which already experiences exposure to corrosive water in present condition this represents an increase of 20 however for the surface waters including the photic zone the projection for the future y2095 scenario represents a near doubling over 114 increase in exposure to waters with ωa 1 it is important to note that the results highlight the mitigation benefit provided by biogeochemical activity from algal growth eelgrass and circulation in preventing 100 exposure to waters with ωa 1 in the future a similar benefit is also experienced by the salish sea environment relative to hypoxia exposure the simulated future response provides an important insight in that perturbations in the form of increased temperature and higher nutrient levels in the system will propagate through the trophic levels in a manner that cannot be estimated through educated guesses the responses to climate perturbations were counterintuitive and will likely differ based on site and estuary specific differences in circulation and loading characteristics in the salish sea domain the effect of anticipated increase in primary production was transmitted almost entirely to upper trophic level resulting in negligible change in algal biomass instead significant 13 and 25 increases in micro and mesozooplankton biomass levels respectively was projected similarly the model results point to nearly a 50 loss of eelgrass biomass in the future it is possible that these results may be artifacts of current eelgrass module parameterization that renders it overly sensitive to temperature salinity and light and will likely be updated in the future as more in field data from eelgrass meadows become available presence of eelgrass does show anticipated improvements to local do and ph levels at locations with significant eelgrass meadows but the results are qualitative and further model improvement site specific calibration for water column interaction is needed for quantitative

24672,in host parasitoid interactions parasitism risk experienced by each host may decrease as the host density increases referred to as the dilution effect when parasitoids can parasitize a limited number of hosts at a given time no matter how abundant hosts are in the relationship between parasitism risk and host parasitoid dynamics the dilution effect is generally considered as a destabilizing factor whereas variability in parasitism risk among hosts is regarded a stabilizing factor however although the dilution effect and variability in parasitism risk have been studied in isolation the simultaneous expression of these two factors in host parasitoid systems has not been investigated this study examines the dilution effect in a patchy environment using a simulation model with a specific focus on the c v 2 1 rule which states that c v 2 1 is a condition for stability where c v is the coefficient of variation in parasitism risk among hosts the simulation model shows that the c v 2 1 rule is a good predictor of stability of the model regardless of the presence or absence of the dilution effect it was also found that the dilution effect increases c v 2 and stabilizes the host parasitoid dynamics keywords host parasitoid dynamics the cv2 1 rule parasitism risk individual variation egg limitation handling time 1 introduction in consumer resource interactions the dilution effect arises when per capita mortality rate of the resource e g prey and hosts decreases as the resource density increases the handling time of consumers is the most routinely incorporated detail that results in the dilution effect holling 1959 when consumers e g predators and parasitoids must spend a duration of time handling time to utilize each resource individually the number of resources that can be utilized by a consumer in a given time is limited regardless of the abundance of resources consequently the proportion of killed resources decreases with an increase in the resource density the dilution effect is an example of self facilitation the allee effect or positive density dependence that commonly destabilizes population dynamics stephens and sutherland 1999 case 2000 handling time has been specifically described as a destabilizing factor in predator prey and host parasitoid dynamics hassell and may 1973 hassell 1978 2000 murdoch et al 2003 although handling time is commonly incorporated in predator prey models host parasitoid models usually do not include handling time because its effect is assumed negligible host parasitoid dynamics are typically described by discrete time models such that one time unit represents a generation time and handling time described in unit of the generation time becomes small for instance when the handling time is 1h and generation time is 30 days the handling time in the model is 1 30 24 0 001 however this is an underestimate because the entire generation of host parasitoid models is represented by foraging processes even when an adult parasitoid lives 30 days it does not mean that the parasitoid continuously forages for 30 24 h for example the parasitoid cephalonomia stephanoderis is inactive resting more than 60 of time daily lauzière et al 2000 and even when a parasitoid is active it is not necessarily foraging for hosts furthermore under natural conditions various demands and disturbances such as thermoregulation predator avoidance and unfavourable weather can further decrease the total foraging duration which can increase the handling time in population models egg limitation is another factor that is capable of inducing the dilution effect proovigenic parasitoids have fixed number of eggs at the start of the adult stage and do not develop new eggs during their adult life once the available eggs are depleted it can no longer parasitize hosts thus causing the dilution effect although synovigenic parasitoids can mature eggs during adult life parasitoids can still experience egg limitation due to the resources such as time and energy required to generate eggs rosenheim et al 2000 carbone and rivera 2003 varone et al 2007 when parasitoids collected from field were dissected for ovary examination egg depletion i e egg limitation was observed in both pro ovigenic and synovigenic species heimpel and rosenheim 1998 mathematical models that incorporate egg limitation have shown that it generally destabilizes host parasitoid dynamics hassell and may 1973 getz and mills 1996 shea et al 1996 regardless of the mechanism e g handling time and egg limitation the dilution effect affects parasitism risk of hosts and this has an important implication to the c v 2 1 rule this rule states that host parasitoid dynamics of a given system will become stable when c v 2 1 where c v represents the coefficient of variation in parasitism risk among hosts hassell and pacala 1990 hassell 2000 in this study c v 2 always refers to the c v 2 of parasitism risk among hosts and how it is computed is described in section2 1 conventionally studies on the c v 2 1 rule assumed that hosts and parasitoids are distributed into spatially distinct habitable areas called patches and the only source of c v 2 is the variability in parasitoid densities among patches assuming the absence of the dilution effect i e type i functional response pacala et al 1990 driessen and hemerik 1991 perry et al 2000 hemachandra et al 2007 pareja et al 2008 maisonhaute et al 2017 when a type i functional response is assumed parasitoid density is the only variable that affects parasitism risk and hosts in patches with many parasitoids experience greater parasitism risk than hosts in patches with few parasitoids and the host distribution has no effect on c v 2 similarly when the dilution effects on host parasitoid dynamics were examined single patch models with c v 2 0 were studied hassell and may 1973 getz and mills 1996 consequently the contribution of the dilution effect to c v 2 is not known in a patchy environment with the dilution effect variability in host densities among patches also contribute to c v 2 for instance hosts in two patches will experience different levels of parasitism risk as long as host densities in the two patches are different even if the parasitoid densities are the same therefore the dilution effect is expected to have positive effects on stability of the host parasitoid systems see section2 1 for details this study examined the role of the dilution effect in dynamics of host parasitoid population in a patchy environment using a simulation model 2 the model the model described byhassell and may 1973 was modified to include the dilution effect this model is a discrete time model in which one time step represents one generation of hosts and parasitoids at each discrete time step denoted by t hosts and parasitoids are distributed into n patches and the total densities i e sum of all patches of hosts and parasitoids are h t and p t respectively the population dynamics is described by 1 h t 1 λ j 1 n x t j exp a y t j 1 a δ x t j 2 p t 1 c j 1 n x t j 1 exp a y t j 1 a δ x t j where x t j u j h t and y t j v j p t j 1 n are the densities of hosts and parasitoids respectively for j th patch at time t u j and v j are the proportions of hosts and parasitoids present at j th patch such that u j v j 1 and h t x t j and p t y t j λ is the finite rate of increase of the host and c is the number of parasitoids that emerge from a parasitized host this study assumes the solitary parasitoid c 1 the model uses a type ii functional response such that a is the attack rate of the parasitoid and δ is typically interpreted as the handling time however in this study δ represents the dilution effect rather than handling time alone in other words the functional response should be interpreted phenomenologically rather than mechanistically the type ii functional response model adequately described predation and parasitism patterns in many systems hassell 1978 but when the estimated parameters of the models are compared with direct observations they rarely match e g ranta and nuutinen 1985 spitze 1985 abrams 1990 which indicates violations of the model s mechanistic assumptions in other words even when the mechanistic assumptions are violated and parameters cannot be mechanistically interpreted the model can still adequately describe various predation and parasitism patterns phenomenologically this formulation as opposed to b x b 0 x where b and b 0 are parameters was used based on convenience because δ 0 eliminates the dilution effect in each generation the host population h t and parasitoid population p t are randomly distributed into n patches by dispersal two vectors containing the proportions u 1 u 2 u n and v 1 v 2 v n are realizations of the random vectors u and v this study assumed the symmetric dirichlet distributions as follows 3 u dirichlet α 4 v dirichlet β where α is a n tuple of α i e a vector of length n whose all elements are α and β is a n tuple of β dirichlet distributions were used because they naturally describe proportions e g u i 1 and 0 u i 1 for all i the expected value and variance of u j j th element of u are 1 n and n 1 n 2 α n 1 respectively which is similarly for v therefore variability in number of organisms among the patches will increase as α and β decreases this model assumes that the hosts and parasitoids are independently distributed 2 1 computation of c v 2 the relationship between the dilution effect and c v 2 becomes clear in the computation of c v 2 consider a case where h hosts and p parasitoids are distributed in n patches ϕ i 1 n is the patch in which i th host is located i 1 h y j is the number of parasitoids in j th patch j 1 n y ϕ i i 1 h is the number of parasitoids experienced by i th host in the absence of the dilution effect δ 0 the coefficient of variation in parasitism risk among hosts is computed by y ϕ i hassell 2000 for example suppose that there are h 6 hosts and p 6 parasitoids distributed in n 2 patches the first patch contains 5 hosts and 1 parasitoid while the second patch contains 1 host and 5 parasitoids then y ϕ i vector will become 1 1 1 1 1 5 whose elements are the numbers of parasitoids or parasitism risk experienced the hosts and the corresponding c v 2 is 0 8 the population variance is used in the computation the above computation is valid when all parasitoids induce the same parasitism pressure however in the presence of the dilution effect δ 0 the parasitism pressure exerted by a parasitoid depends on the number of hosts in the same patch therefore all parasitoids cannot be treated equally in this case y ϕ i is diluted as z ϕ i y ϕ i 1 a δ x ϕ i where x j is the number of host in j th patch i e j 1 n x j h using the same two patches example with a 1 and δ 0 1 the parasitism risk experienced by each host z ϕ i is 0 67 0 67 0 67 0 67 0 67 4 55 and the resulting c v 2 is 1 21 as such δ can increase c v 2 due to variation in host number among patches and also contribute to variation in the parasitism risk this study adopted this method to compute c v 2 but because the number of hosts in each patch x i is not discrete weighted mean and variance were used to compute the coefficient of variation where the weights were the host density x i 2 2 analysis the model was simulated with the initial total densities h 0 n x and p 0 n y where x and y are the equilibrium host and parasitoid density respectively for each patch i e if u j v j 1 n for all j for all generations the densities remain at the equilibrium two properties were examined stability and c v 2 there are three possible outcomes of the model the first outcome is that at least one of the species becomes extinct the second outcome is that both host and parasitoid populations increase indefinitely e g positive geometric population growths the third outcome is that both host and parasitoid populations persist without going into extinction or increasing indefinitely in this study stable dynamics was identified by the third type of dynamics when a system persisted without falling into the first two types of dynamics for 10 000 generations it was considered stable the probability of stable dynamics was examined by running 1000 replications the indefinite positive growth was identified when the host and parasitoid population densities h t and p t doubled in every 100 generations for 5 consecutive times after both populations reached at least 1 1 0 6 owing to the fact c v 2 changes along the population dynamics the geometric average of c v 2 over 1 1 0 5 generation was used as the summary when the model does not persist for 1 1 0 5 generations the simulation was repeated until 1 1 0 5 samples were attained the purpose of the analysis was to examine how the dilution effect δ influences stability and c v 2 of the model to examine interactions among the model parameters parameter values were systematically varied the dilution effect δ was varied from 0 to 0 5 such that the influence of dilution effect can be clearly described i e δ 0 versus δ 0 α and β were varied from 0 1 to 2 which encompassed a wide range of c v 2 the number of patches n was changed from 1 to 101 the attack rate and finite rate of increase were arbitrarily chosen as a 0 01 and λ 1 1 however the qualitative patterns described in this study are not specific to these parameters 3 results regardless of the presence δ 0 or absence δ 0 of the dilution effect simulation outcomes were largely consistent with the c v 2 1 rule in other words the parameter regions associated with c v 2 1 and stability have good correspondence fig 1 in fig 1 parameter combinations resulting in c v 2 20 are greyed together and the highest c v 2 in the region was 7 39 1 0 15 population dynamics associated with such high values of c v 2 was the unbounded growth of both the host and parasitoid given that the highest c v 2 reported in a study that examined a number of field systems is 7 77 although these estimates do not account for the dilution effect pacala et al 1990 the very high values of c v 2 found in the simulation were considered unrealistic i e such parameter combinations are biologically infeasible in absence of the dilution effect δ 0 c v 2 and stability mainly depended on distribution of the parasitoids among patches controlled by β the host distribution controlled by α had a weak influence on c v 2 but its effect was enhanced when variabilities in the parasitoid and host densities are high when variabilities in the host and parasitoid distributions were high i e when α and β are small hosts and parasitoids were concentrated in a small number of patches and most of the patches were empty or close to empty when there were many potential patches 50 patches in fig 1 due to independent distribution of the hosts and parasitoids chances that the patches aggregated by the host and parasitoid do not match increase as between patch variabilities in the densities increase this often results in low c v 2 because nearly all hosts experience weak parasitism risk but can also result in very high c v 2 by chance in other words variability in c v 2 becomes high in fig 1 c v 2 is summarized by the geometric mean and therefore negatively influenced by variability in c v 2 in the presence of the dilution effect δ 0 c v 2 increased with increase in variability in the host distribution fig 1 according to the mechanism described above section2 1 because the dilution effect is influenced by the host distribution even when the parasitoid density is constant in all patches a strong c v 2 can be realized when α is small the dynamics of c v 2 show that even when a system is stable and the average c v 2 is greater than 1 c v 2 is frequently lower than 1 in some generations and vice versa fig 2 when there are many patches a relatively weak dilution effect is sufficient to stabilize the host parasitoid dynamics fig 3 4 discussion the dilution effect influences c v 2 section2 1 in the absence of the dilution effect parasitism risk of a host solely depends on the parasitoid density in the same patch on the other hand in presence of the dilution effect not only the parasitoid density but also the host density can contribute to the parasitism risk and thus c v 2 is generally higher in the presence of the dilution effect than in its absence simulation results were consistent with the c v 2 1 rule in which the dilution effect enhanced stability by increasing c v 2 the result has important implications in the application of the c v 2 1 rule to field data to quantify c v 2 previous studies have estimated the parasitoid density in a patch from parasitized and unparasitized hosts in the patch by assuming that parasitoids have a type i functional response i e no dilution effect pacala et al 1990 driessen and hemerik 1991 perry et al 2000 hemachandra et al 2007 pareja et al 2008 maisonhaute et al 2017 however in presence of the dilution effect such estimates suffer at least two problems first estimates of parasitoid densities may be inaccurate because the assumption i e no dilution effect is wrong second even when the estimated parasitoid densities are accurate or known from direct observations estimates of c v 2 are still inaccurate because the contribution of the dilution effect to c v 2 described above was not accounted in fact even when the number of parasitoids is the same for all patches c v 2 0 in the conventional estimate large c v 2 can emerge through the dilution effect a few studies that directly observed parasitoid densities found that estimated parasitoid densities following the conventional method and parasitoid densities from direct observations do not match driessen and hemerik 1991 reeve et al 1994 a potential reason for this inconsistency is that type i functional response is an inappropriate representation of parasitism occurring in the field some observations have suggested the presence of the dilution effect also discussed in introduction when the correlation between the proportion of parasitized hosts and total host density was examined in 65 published studies to estimate c v 2 26 data sets showed a negative correlation at least in the point estimate hassell and pacala 1990 some studies reported clear negative correlations brown and cameron 1979 hemachandra et al 2007 although a negative correlation between the two variables is a signature of the dilution effect it cannot be considered as an evidence of the dilution effect because the same pattern can also emerge when parasitoid and host densities are negatively correlated and this is the interpretation in the conventional method when a type i functional response is assumed direct observation of the parasitoid distribution is an important piece of data that have to be collected even though they may be much more logistically difficult to observe quantify than the host densities such data are also needed when selecting and parameterizing distributions of organisms although the distributions were conveniently assumed in this study eqs 3 and 4 temporal dynamics is another important issue in the c v 2 1 rule c v 2 is not a static property of host parasitoid systems and it changes dynamically fig 2 therefore a snap shot estimation of c v 2 may have an insufficient value to make any inference on dynamics of the respective system even when a system is stable with the average c v 2 greater than 1 the system frequently shows c v 2 1 along its dynamics and vice versa fig 2 although it is possible to describe such variability over time in empirical studies redfern et al 1992 jones et al 1993 van veen et al 2002 bonsall et al 2004 it is a demanding task furthermore simply describing a time series of c v 2 based on a particular method does not resolve any of the competing mechanisms of producing the pattern e g the dilution effect discussed above in other words without being able to accurately describe a snap shot of c v 2 a time series cannot also be described in addition although this study used the geometric mean of c v 2 for the sake of convenience which had a better performance than the arithmetic mean when the match between c v 2 1 and stability was considered it is necessary to describe how temporal variability in c v 2 should be best summarized although the dilution effect destabilizes host parasitoid dynamics in a single patch hassell and may 1973 getz and mills 1996 it can stabilize host parasitoid dynamics when hosts and parasitoids are distributed in patches this study discussed handling time and egg limitation as factors contributing to the dilution effect but they are not the only factors that can produce host density dependent parasitism risk for example various host flies pupate in the soil hennessey 1994 alyokhin et al 2001 woltz and lee 2017 in which hosts that are deeply located in the soil may enjoy reduced parasitism risk okuyama 2019 when pupation depth is influenced by host density okuyama 2020 parasitism risk is also influenced by host density similarly factors that influence parasitism risk e g durations of vulnerable life stages can also be influenced by host density sullivan and sokal 1963 yang et al 2015 if the dilution effect or host density dependent parasitism risk is found to be ubiquitous the mechanism described in this study may be studied with other ecological details e g

24672,in host parasitoid interactions parasitism risk experienced by each host may decrease as the host density increases referred to as the dilution effect when parasitoids can parasitize a limited number of hosts at a given time no matter how abundant hosts are in the relationship between parasitism risk and host parasitoid dynamics the dilution effect is generally considered as a destabilizing factor whereas variability in parasitism risk among hosts is regarded a stabilizing factor however although the dilution effect and variability in parasitism risk have been studied in isolation the simultaneous expression of these two factors in host parasitoid systems has not been investigated this study examines the dilution effect in a patchy environment using a simulation model with a specific focus on the c v 2 1 rule which states that c v 2 1 is a condition for stability where c v is the coefficient of variation in parasitism risk among hosts the simulation model shows that the c v 2 1 rule is a good predictor of stability of the model regardless of the presence or absence of the dilution effect it was also found that the dilution effect increases c v 2 and stabilizes the host

that results in the dilution effect holling 1959 when consumers e g predators and parasitoids must spend a duration of time handling time to utilize each resource individually the number of resources that can be utilized by a consumer in a given time is limited regardless of the abundance of resources consequently the proportion of killed resources decreases with an increase in the resource

handling time has been specifically described as a destabilizing factor in predator prey and host parasitoid dynamics hassell and may 1973 hassell 1978 2000 murdoch et al 2003 although handling time is commonly incorporated in predator prey models host parasitoid models usually do not include handling time because its effect is assumed negligible host parasitoid dynamics are typically described by discrete time models such that one time unit represents a generation time and handling time described in unit of the generation time becomes small for instance when the handling time is 1h and generation time is 30 days the handling time in the model is 1 30 24 0 001 however this is an underestimate because the entire generation of host parasitoid models is represented by foraging processes even when an adult parasitoid lives 30 days it does not mean that the parasitoid continuously forages for 30 24 h for example the parasitoid cephalonomia stephanoderis is inactive resting more than 60 of time daily lauzière et al 2000 and even when a parasitoid is active it is not necessarily foraging for hosts furthermore under natural conditions various demands and disturbances such as thermoregulation predator avoidance and unfavourable weather can further decrease the total foraging duration which can increase the handling time in population models egg limitation is another factor that is capable of inducing the dilution effect proovigenic parasitoids have fixed number of eggs at the start of the adult stage and do not develop new eggs during their adult life once the available eggs are depleted it can no longer parasitize hosts thus causing the dilution effect although synovigenic parasitoids can mature eggs during adult life parasitoids can still experience egg limitation due to the resources such as time and energy required to generate eggs rosenheim et al 2000 carbone and rivera 2003 varone et al 2007 when parasitoids collected from field were dissected for ovary examination egg depletion i e egg limitation was observed in both pro ovigenic and synovigenic species heimpel and rosenheim 1998 mathematical models that incorporate egg limitation have shown that it generally destabilizes host parasitoid dynamics hassell and may 1973 getz and mills 1996 shea et al 1996 regardless of the mechanism e g handling time and egg limitation the dilution effect affects parasitism risk of hosts and this has an important implication to the c v 2 1 rule this rule states that host parasitoid dynamics of a given system will become stable when c v 2 1 where c v represents the coefficient of variation in parasitism risk among hosts hassell and pacala 1990 hassell 2000 in this study c v 2 always refers to the c v 2 of parasitism risk among hosts and how it is computed is described in section2 1 conventionally studies on the c v 2 1 rule assumed that hosts and parasitoids are distributed into spatially distinct habitable areas called patches and the only source of c v 2 is the variability in parasitoid densities among patches assuming the absence of the dilution effect i e type i functional response pacala et al 1990 driessen and hemerik 1991 perry et al 2000 hemachandra et al 2007 pareja et al 2008 maisonhaute et al 2017 when a type i functional response is assumed parasitoid density is the only variable that affects parasitism risk and hosts in patches with many parasitoids experience greater parasitism risk than hosts in patches with few parasitoids and the host distribution has no effect on c v 2 similarly when the dilution effects on host parasitoid dynamics were examined single patch models with c v 2 0 were studied hassell and may 1973 getz and mills 1996 consequently the contribution of the dilution effect to c v 2 is not known in a patchy environment with the dilution effect variability in host densities among patches also contribute to c v 2 for instance hosts in two patches will experience different levels of parasitism risk as long as host densities in the two patches are different even if the parasitoid densities are the same therefore the dilution effect is expected to have positive effects on stability of the host parasitoid systems see section2 1 for details this study examined the role of the dilution effect in dynamics of host parasitoid population in a patchy environment using a simulation model 2 the model the model described byhassell and may 1973 was modified to include the dilution effect this model is a discrete time model in which one time step represents one generation of hosts and parasitoids at each discrete time step denoted by t hosts and parasitoids are distributed into n patches and the total densities i e sum of all patches of hosts and parasitoids are h t and p t respectively the population dynamics is described by 1 h t 1 λ j 1 n x t j exp a y t j 1 a δ x t j 2 p t 1 c j 1 n x t j 1 exp a y t j 1 a δ x t j where x t j u j h t and y t j v j p t j 1 n are the densities of hosts and parasitoids respectively for j th patch at time t u j and v j are the proportions of hosts and parasitoids present at j th patch such that u j v j 1 and h t x t j and p t y t j λ is the finite rate of increase of the host and c is the number of parasitoids that emerge from a parasitized host this study assumes the solitary parasitoid c 1 the model uses a type ii functional response such that a is the attack rate of the parasitoid and δ is typically interpreted as the handling time however in this study δ represents the dilution effect rather than handling time alone in other words the functional response should be interpreted phenomenologically rather than mechanistically the type ii functional response model adequately described predation and parasitism patterns in many systems hassell 1978 but when the estimated parameters of the models are compared with direct observations they rarely match e g ranta and nuutinen 1985 spitze 1985 abrams 1990 which indicates violations of the model s mechanistic assumptions in other words even when the mechanistic assumptions are violated and parameters cannot be mechanistically interpreted the model can still adequately describe various predation and parasitism patterns phenomenologically this formulation as opposed to b x b 0 x where b and b 0 are parameters was used based on convenience because δ 0 eliminates the dilution effect in each generation the host population h t and parasitoid population p t are randomly distributed into n patches by dispersal two vectors containing the proportions u 1 u 2 u n and v 1 v 2 v n are realizations of the random vectors u and v this study assumed the symmetric dirichlet distributions as follows 3 u dirichlet α 4 v dirichlet β where α is a n tuple of α i e a vector of length n whose all elements are α and β is a n tuple of β dirichlet distributions were used because they naturally describe proportions e g u i 1 and 0 u i 1 for all i the expected value and variance of u j j th element of u are 1 n and n 1 n 2 α n 1 respectively which is similarly for v therefore variability in number of organisms among the patches will increase as α and β decreases this model assumes that the hosts and parasitoids are independently distributed 2 1 computation of c v 2 the relationship between the dilution effect and c v 2 becomes clear in the computation of c v 2 consider a case where h hosts and p parasitoids are distributed in n patches ϕ i 1 n is the patch in which i th host is located i 1 h y j is the number of parasitoids in j th patch j 1 n y ϕ i i 1 h is the number of parasitoids experienced by i th host in the absence of the dilution effect δ 0 the coefficient of variation in parasitism risk among hosts is computed by y ϕ i hassell 2000 for example suppose that there are h 6 hosts and p 6 parasitoids distributed in n 2 patches the first patch contains 5 hosts and 1 parasitoid while the second patch contains 1 host and 5 parasitoids then y ϕ i vector will become 1 1 1 1 1 5 whose elements are the numbers of parasitoids or parasitism risk experienced the hosts and the corresponding c v 2 is 0 8 the population variance is used in the computation the above computation is valid when all parasitoids induce the same parasitism pressure however in the presence of the dilution effect δ 0 the parasitism pressure exerted by a parasitoid depends on the number of hosts in the same patch therefore all parasitoids cannot be treated equally in this case y ϕ i is diluted as z ϕ i y ϕ i 1 a δ x ϕ i where x j is the number of host in j th patch i e j 1 n x j h using the same two patches example with a 1 and δ 0 1 the parasitism risk experienced by each host z ϕ i is 0 67 0 67 0 67 0 67 0 67 4 55 and the resulting c v 2 is 1 21 as such δ can increase c v 2 due to variation in host number among patches and also contribute to variation in the parasitism risk this study adopted this method to compute c v 2 but because the number of hosts in each patch x i is not discrete weighted mean and variance were used to compute the coefficient of variation where the weights were the host density x i 2 2 analysis the model was simulated with the initial total densities h 0 n x and p 0 n y where x and y are the equilibrium host and parasitoid density respectively for each patch i e if u j v j 1 n for all j for all generations the densities remain at the equilibrium two properties were examined stability and c v 2 there are three possible outcomes of the model the first outcome is that at least one of the species becomes extinct the second outcome is that both host and parasitoid populations increase indefinitely e g positive geometric population growths the third outcome is that both host and parasitoid populations persist without going into extinction or increasing indefinitely in this study stable dynamics was identified by the third type of dynamics when a system persisted without falling into the first two types of dynamics for 10 000 generations it was considered stable the probability of stable dynamics was examined by running 1000 replications the indefinite positive growth was identified when the host and parasitoid population densities h t and p t doubled in every 100 generations for 5 consecutive times after both populations reached at least 1 1 0 6 owing to the fact c v 2 changes along the population dynamics the geometric average of c v 2 over 1 1 0 5 generation was used as the summary when the model does not persist for 1 1 0 5 generations the simulation was repeated until 1 1 0 5 samples were attained the purpose of the analysis was to examine how the dilution effect δ influences stability and c v 2 of the model to examine interactions among the model parameters parameter values were systematically varied the dilution effect δ was varied from 0 to 0 5 such that the influence of dilution effect can be clearly described i e δ 0 versus δ 0 α and β were varied from 0 1 to 2 which encompassed a wide range of c v 2 the number of patches n was changed from 1 to 101 the attack rate and finite rate of increase were arbitrarily chosen as a 0 01 and λ 1 1 however the qualitative patterns described in this study are not specific to these parameters 3 results regardless of the presence δ 0 or absence δ 0 of the dilution effect simulation outcomes were largely consistent with the c v 2 1 rule in other words the parameter regions associated with c v 2 1 and stability have good correspondence fig 1 in fig 1 parameter combinations resulting in c v 2 20 are greyed together and the highest c v 2 in the region was 7 39 1 0 15 population dynamics associated with such high values of c v 2 was the unbounded growth of both the host and parasitoid given that the highest c v 2 reported in a study that examined a number of field systems is 7 77 although these estimates do not account for the dilution effect pacala et al 1990 the very high values of c v 2 found in the simulation were considered unrealistic i e such parameter combinations are biologically infeasible in absence of the dilution effect δ 0 c v 2 and stability mainly depended on distribution of the parasitoids among patches controlled by β the host distribution controlled by α had a weak influence on c v 2 but its effect was enhanced when variabilities in the parasitoid and host densities are high when variabilities in the host and parasitoid distributions were high i e when α and β are small hosts and parasitoids were concentrated in a small number of patches and most of the patches were empty or close to empty when there were many potential patches 50 patches in fig 1 due to independent distribution of the hosts and parasitoids chances that the patches aggregated by the host and parasitoid do not match increase as between patch variabilities in the densities increase this often results in low c v 2 because nearly all hosts experience weak parasitism risk but can also result in very high c v 2 by chance in other words variability in c v 2 becomes high in fig 1 c v 2 is summarized by the geometric mean and therefore negatively influenced by variability in c v 2 in the presence of the dilution effect δ 0 c v 2 increased with increase in variability in the host distribution fig 1 according to the mechanism described above section2 1 because the dilution effect is influenced by the host distribution even when the parasitoid density is constant in all patches a strong c v 2 can be realized when α is small the dynamics of c v 2 show that even when a system is stable and the average c v 2 is greater than 1 c v 2 is frequently lower than 1 in some generations and vice versa fig 2 when there are many patches a relatively weak dilution effect is sufficient to stabilize the host parasitoid dynamics fig 3 4 discussion the dilution effect influences c v 2 section2 1 in the absence of the dilution effect parasitism risk of a host solely depends on the parasitoid density in the same patch on the other hand in presence of the dilution effect not only the parasitoid density but also the host density can contribute to the parasitism risk and thus c v 2 is generally higher in the presence of the dilution effect than in its absence simulation results were consistent with the c v 2 1 rule in which the dilution effect enhanced stability by increasing c v 2 the result has important implications in the application of the c v 2 1 rule to field data to quantify c v 2 previous studies have estimated the parasitoid density in a patch from parasitized and unparasitized hosts in the patch by assuming that parasitoids have a type i functional response i e no dilution effect pacala et al 1990 driessen and hemerik 1991 perry et al 2000 hemachandra et al 2007 pareja et al 2008 maisonhaute et al 2017 however in presence of the dilution effect such estimates suffer at least two problems first estimates of parasitoid densities may be inaccurate because the assumption i e no dilution effect is wrong second even when the estimated parasitoid densities are accurate or known from direct observations estimates of c v 2 are still inaccurate because the contribution of the dilution effect to c v 2 described above was not accounted in fact even when the number of parasitoids is the same for all patches c v 2 0 in the conventional estimate large c v 2 can emerge through the dilution effect a few studies that directly observed parasitoid densities found that estimated parasitoid densities following the conventional method and parasitoid densities from direct observations do not match driessen and hemerik 1991 reeve et al 1994 a potential reason for this inconsistency is that type i functional response is an inappropriate representation of parasitism occurring in the field some observations have suggested the presence of the dilution effect also discussed in introduction when the correlation between the proportion of parasitized hosts and total host density was examined in 65 published studies to estimate c v 2 26 data sets showed a negative correlation at least in the point estimate hassell and pacala 1990 some studies reported clear negative correlations brown and cameron 1979 hemachandra et al 2007 although a negative correlation between the two variables is a signature of the dilution effect it cannot be considered as an evidence of the dilution effect because the same pattern can also emerge when parasitoid and host densities are negatively correlated and this is the interpretation in the conventional method when a type i functional response is assumed direct observation of the parasitoid distribution is an important piece of data that have to be collected even though they may be much more logistically difficult to observe quantify than the host densities such data are also needed when selecting and parameterizing distributions of organisms although the distributions were conveniently assumed in this study eqs 3 and 4 temporal dynamics is another important issue in the c v 2 1 rule c v 2 is not a static property of host parasitoid systems and it changes dynamically fig 2 therefore a snap shot estimation of c v 2 may have an insufficient value to make any inference on dynamics of the respective system even when a system is stable with the average c v 2 greater than 1 the system frequently shows c v 2 1 along its dynamics and vice versa fig 2 although it is possible to describe such variability over time in empirical studies redfern et al 1992 jones et al 1993 van veen et al 2002 bonsall et al 2004 it is a demanding task furthermore simply describing a time series of c v 2 based on a particular method does not resolve any of the competing mechanisms of producing the pattern e g the dilution effect discussed above in other words without being able to accurately describe a snap shot of c v 2 a time series cannot also be described in addition although this study used the geometric mean of c v 2 for the sake of convenience which had a better performance than the arithmetic mean when the match between c v 2 1 and stability was considered it is necessary to describe how temporal variability in c v 2 should be best summarized although the dilution effect destabilizes host parasitoid dynamics in a single patch hassell and may 1973 getz and mills 1996 it can stabilize host parasitoid dynamics when hosts and parasitoids are distributed in patches this study discussed handling time and egg limitation as factors contributing to the dilution effect but they are not the only factors that can produce host density dependent parasitism risk for example various host flies pupate in the soil hennessey 1994 alyokhin et al 2001 woltz and lee 2017 in which hosts that are deeply located in the soil may enjoy reduced parasitism risk okuyama 2019 when pupation depth is influenced by host density okuyama 2020 parasitism risk is also influenced by host density similarly factors that influence parasitism risk e g durations of vulnerable life stages can also be influenced by host density sullivan and sokal 1963 yang et al 2015 if the dilution effect or host density dependent parasitism risk is found to be ubiquitous the mechanism described in this study may be studied with other ecological details e g

24673,control theory and stochastic dynamic programming have long been used to develop optimal single species management policies however most species interact with others through competition and predation as parts of complex ecosystems as a consequence it is unclear how far from optimal the single species policies currently in use actually are moreover there are as yet no scalable algorithms for optimal ecosystem management here we merge recently developed tools from machine learning and nonlinear dynamics to construct and evaluate near optimal policies in multi species systems specifically a non parametric model for the dynamics is estimated from time series data using gaussian process based dynamic modeling a policy is then derived from the inferred dynamics using a temporal difference learning algorithm policy performance is benchmarked against single species policies and the ad hoc ecosystem policies that have been previously offered we found that edp policies are closer to the true optimal policies than single species policies in multi species systems with two controls and three objectives the pareto fronts illustrate the flexibility of edp policies compared with single species policies keywords multi species management multi objectives management non linear methods approximate dynamic programming gaussian process regression temporal difference learning code accessibility a matlab implementation of the edp package can be found at https github com antoinebrias edp 1 introduction the sustainable management of natural resources is an urgent concern with many parties calling for ecosystem based approaches pikitch et al 2004 fletcher et al 2010 fulton et al 2014 there are many good reasons for doing so pikitch et al 2004 fogarty 2014 perhaps the most pragmatic of which is that an ecosystem approach requires us to be explicit about the trade offs that occur between competing uses of the system here we focus on trade offs that may occur between and within the objectives of conservation and harvesting most obviously extractive uses may impede conservation goals such as protecting endangered species and maintaining biodiversity venter et al 2006 smith 2011 pennino et al 2018 for example koehn et al 2017 explored the trade offs between forage fish harvesting and non market predators in the california current observing large reductions in biomass of seabirds such as brown pelicans and marble murrelets sea lions and baleen whales similarly in forest management there are trade offs between timber extraction and the availability of suitable wildlife habitat davis et al 2017 trade offs between disparate exploitative uses of an ecosystem have also been studied extensively clark 1993 in marine systems harvesting forage species e g for conversion to fish meal reduces the harvestable biomass of dependent predators in mangrove ecosystems coastal fisheries may be negatively impacted by forestry activity which reduces the mangrove ecosystem services such as habitat food and good water quality grasso 1998 finally conservation and restoration efforts may also be in tension for instance the removal of invasive marsh grass spartina alterniflora resulted in the decline of the endangered california rail rallus obsoletus obsoletus which used spartina for cover and nest materials schroder et al 2016 hence it is common for policy makers to face conflicts between food production wealth generation restoration and conservation see e g crutchfield 2004 charles 2009 in order for managers to balance these competing objectives in a rational and transparent way we need to quantify the trade offs among them one approach is to identify a single common currency to be optimized e g dollars see laurila pant et al 2015 for a review of valuation techniques however the trade offs considered here involve inherently disparate values e g revenues and biodiversity that are not easily distilled to a single objective multi objective optimization allows us to quantify trade offs among disparate goals by identifying the set of trade off solutions williams and kendall 2017 which are optimal policies corresponding to different weights for each objective the resulting set of values defines a curve 2 objectives or surface more known as the pareto front or efficiency frontier conservation and management problems have been addressed via multi objective optimization approaches for many year walters and hilborn 1978 mardle and pascoe 1999 bulte and horan 2003 diaz balteiro and romero 2008 higgins et al 2008 kennedy et al 2008 williams and kendall 2017 for instance lafond et al 2017 identified efficient management scenarios of uneven aged mountain forests illustrating the impact of considering additional ecosystem services in optimal control process and highlighting the advantages e g providing trade off scenarios and the weaknesses e g computational cost of the pareto front method in a marine example cheung and sumaila 2008 showed that management of the northern south china sea is currently sub optimal in both conservation and economic objectives and proposed trade off solutions for future management policies to date the use of multi objective approaches in ecosystem management has been limited to small state spaces for which the system dynamics are assumed known the past three decades have witnessed major advances in ecosystem modeling in marine systems the state of the art includes spatial models such as the atlantis gom with 91 species driven by realistic currents and climatology grüss et al 2018 spatially explicit models have been used widely to evaluate various multi species management strategies mahévas and pelletier 2004 pikitch et al 2004 however these exercises typically evaluate the performance of ad hoc policies rather than identify optimal control rules the breadth and complexity of these models which lends them their realism also prevent us from running the vast number of iterations required to identify optimal policies as a consequence it is impossible to know how far the resulting policies are from being optimal moreover despite dramatic increases in the complexity and realism of ecosystem models they are still far from complete there are numerous state variables and interactions that have been omitted including for instance individual variation in traits bolnick et al 2011 genetic variation and contemporary evolution ellner et al 2011 and non consumptive interactions peckarsky et al 2008 there is mounting evidences that these missing state variables and interactions may have strong influences on ecological dynamics werner and peacor 2003 and the forecast accuracy of ecosystem models is rarely tested petchey et al 2015 this structural uncertainty williams 2001 cressie et al 2009 athanassoglou and xepapadeas 2012 is increasingly acknowledged in ecological models and fisheries ecosystems charles 1998 plagányi 2007 hence there is a need for a multi objective decision framework that is suitable for realistic state spaces with incompletely specified dynamics empirical dynamic modeling edm circumvents the problem of incompletely specified ecological dynamics perretti et al 2013 munch et al 2017 non parametric methods based on nonlinear dynamics and time delay embedding outperform parametric models in both forecasting perretti et al 2013 and management boettiger et al 2015 for simulated data in addition to successful applications for specific species ye et al 2015 deyle et al 2018 a recent meta analysis of 185 fish populations indicates that edm outperforms i e make more accurate short term predications standard fisheries parametric models for 90 percent of the populations studied munch et al 2018 for a 1 d system boettiger et al 2015 showed that edm could be used to generate robust harvest policies that produce near optimal yields while avoiding tipping points due to allee effects hence if sufficient data are available it is feasible that we could use edm in a multi objective setting to manage ecosystems however existing simulations have been restricted to single objectives and relatively small systems since it is rarely possible to compute an optimal harvest policy analytically numerical methods must be employed stochastic dynamic programming sdp has long been the tool of choice for sequential decision problems mangel and clark 1988 mangel 2015 for example sdp has been used to identify optimal harvest policies in single and two species fisheries poudel et al 2012 boettiger et al 2015 although sdp has become increasingly important in natural resource management and conservation planning shea and possingham 2000 milner gulland 1997 the tractability of sdp in ecosystem management is limited to small state and control spaces see e g ramirez and saunders 1999 shea and possingham 2000 in larger systems with multiple decision makers and uncertain dynamics success is more limited sdp models scale poorly with the dimension of the state and control such that optimizing management of more than 3 or 4 species via sdp is computationally impractical a variety of algorithms have been developed to ameliorate the computational burden of sdp known collectively as approximate dynamic programming adp algorithms such as temporal difference td learning allow us to compute a near optimal harvest policy in larger state spaces however td has not been widely used on ecosystem management problems and it is unclear how close to optimal the resulting policies will be for typical ecological problems based on these considerations we introduce a multi objective framework for multi species management based on edm and adp which we refer to as empirical dynamic programming edp the approach computes near optimal policies for balancing trade offs among several competing objectives without the need to specify a model for the ecosystem or community dynamics after introducing the algorithm we first determine how close a policy based on edm comes to the correct optimal policy and whether it outperforms policy from an incorrect single species model we do this in a two species system where it is feasible to compute the optimal policy using traditional sdp in this setting we also evaluate how close adp policies are to the true optimal policies following this we illustrate the algorithm s performance with an additional example which illustrates the scalability of our algorithm by computing near optimal policies in a five species system in this system management attempts to balance yields from two distinct trophic levels while maintaining the abundance of a protected species that interacts with them 2 methods our goal is to construct a near optimal multi species and multi objective management policies based directly on the observed behavior of the system the main steps are 1 using edm to forecast the future state of the ecosystem given the current state and control 2 use sdp or adp to determine the optimal near optimal policy shown schematically in fig 1 2 1 model free forecasting using gaussian process we begin by describing the ecosystem dynamics and the edm forecasting algorithm in principle the algorithm we present applies to general state and control spaces in which there are n state variables m controls and m may be greater than or less than n the state variables may in general represent such things as population sizes habitat quality parameters and other factors that contribute to the dynamics the controls may in general represent such things as harvest rates rates of outplanting nutrient loadings etc however for clarity of exposition we focus specifically on multi species harvesting and conservation problems important differences between the harvesting algorithm and more general ecosystem management are described in the discussion say we have a system composed of n species whose abundance either counts or biomass at time t is given by x t x 1 t x 2 t x n t x r n the controls u t u 1 t u 2 t u n t u r n indicate the fraction of each population removed at time t species that are not harvested have u i t fixed at 0 the system dynamics are given by some unknown set of equations h i 1 x i t 1 h i x t u t w t where w t represents some process stochasticity we assume that these unknown dynamics can be approximated using a log gaussian process takens 1981 munch et al 2017 specifically 2 x i t 1 s i t e f i s 1 t s 2 t s n t ε i t 3 ε i t i d d n 0 ν i where 4 s i t x i t 1 u i t again x i t and u i t are the state and the control for species i at time t and ε i t are the uncertainties in the dynamics for each species the shape of each f i is unknown must be estimated from the available data we model f i using gaussian process gp regression rasmussen and williams 2006 and we define the gp regression g called edm gp hereafter to avoid confusion which takes as input the current state x t and the current control of the system u t and gives the next state as output 5 x t 1 g x t u t w t where ω t represents the stochasticity because our focus is on control rather than forecasting the gp is trained using all the data points in the time series we suggest that the forecast accuracy of the edm gp be established on out of sample data before edp is undertaken e g munch et al 2017 gps have been used in classification and regression e g gibbs and mackay 1997 williams 1998 and more recently in ecological modeling munch et al 2005 2017 the gp is a continuous generalization of the multivariate normal distribution completely defined by its mean and a covariance functions in the absence of strong prior information on the shape of f i we set the prior mean to zero so that f i gp 0 k i the covariance functions k i control the flexibility of the estimated functions in keeping with past applications munch et al 2017 2018 we used the squared exponential covariance given by 6 the hyperparameters ν i τ i and φ i j of the edm gp respectively correspond to the process variance the pointwise prior variance in f and the lag specific length scale parameters respectively independent diffuse b e t a 1 1 1 1 priors are used on ν i v a r s i and τ i v a r s i to constrain the variance in the predicted population at a given current state to be less than twice the observed total variance allowing τ i to be unbounded creates numerical convergence issues that have little impact on the fit to the data beyond twice the observed variance the likelihood for τ i is relatively flat increasing these parameters any further cannot improve the fit in a meaningful way so this constraint improves convergence without sacrificing fit following an argument from munch et al 2017 a prior is used for φ i j to control the wiggliness of the estimated function by setting the expected number of local extrema to 1 along each axis specifically we set half normal prior φ i j 2 e φ i j 2 2 v 2 π v as detailed in munch et al 2017 setting v π 12 means that f has on average one local extremum over the range of the data scaled to lie between 0 and 1 given this specification the edm gp is fit to available data by maximizing the posterior over choices of the hyperparameters using the r prop algorithm riedmiller and braun 1993 predictions for any new system state conditional on the training data are made with the hyperparameters set to the posterior mode see munch et al 2017 for further details 2 2 dynamic programming for ecosystem management our goal is to identify policies that balance management and conservation goals to do so we use sdp or adp to maximize the long run discounted reward for each species r i u i t x i t for harvested species the reward at time t is given by the portion of the population captured i e r i u i t x i t u i t x i t for conserved species the reward is simply the current population size i e r i u i t x i t x i t harvesting costs can be incorporated directly e g r i u i t x i t u i t x i t c h u i t x i t if the catchability function h is known other objectives are certainly possible such as minimizing extinction risk senina et al 1999 or the spreading the age distribution brunel and piet 2013 these can be incorporated into this framework fairly easily provided that the data are available to effectively reconstruct the dynamics of the relevant state variables given these rewards we want to find the policy u x i e the set of controls for each possible system state that maximizes each of the long run average discounted rewards j to construct the pareto front we use the scalarization trick roijers et al 2013 in which we combine the objectives using a set of weights w i which we then vary between 0 and 1 γ is called the discount factor which gives information on the importance of a reward in the future compared to the current reward 7 j i 1 n w i t 0 γ t r i x i t u i t in order to find the optimal policy we introduce the value function v x t which satisfies the dynamic programming equation clark 1993 8 v x t m a x u t r x t u t γ e v x t 1 x t u t with 9 r x t u t i 1 n w i r i x i t u i t v x t represents the long run average reward for the system given that we start in state x t although implicitly defined by 8 the value function must be found numerically which is the core the dynamic programming algorithm the global reward r 9 is a weighted sum of the relative objective specific rewards note that when only one objective matters one weight is set to 1 and all others to 0 to facilitate interpretability across incommensurate units we have scaled the relative rewards by this single objective maximum for example in a 2 species system where we are interested in harvesting species 1 for example r 1 u 1 t x 1 t u 1 t x 1 t and conserving species 2 for example r 2 u 2 t x 2 t x 2 t the weighting w 1 0 1 and w 2 0 9 would indicate a high priority for conserving species 2 when the value function associated to a policy u x for every state x is larger or equal to the value of any other policy the policy is said to be optimal puterman 2005 for a small system with 1 2 or 3 dimensions the long run average reward can be computed using dynamic programming poudel et al 2012 boettiger et al 2015 but when the number of dimensions increases sdp becomes computationally infeasible to overcome this computational hurdle we use an approximate dynamic programming algorithm based on temporal difference learning sutton 1988 as suggested by powell 2007 we break the original transition function 2 into two steps 10 x i t s i t e f i s 1 t s 2 t s n t and 11 x i t 1 x i t e ε i t where f i s 1 t s 2 t s n t is the posterior mean and ε i t i d d n 0 ν i we refer to x i t as the post decision state variable for each species which captures the state of the system following the implementation of the control powell 2007 the post decision state is a deterministic function of x t and u t x i t is then called the pre decision state variable we denote the post decision state as x t x 1 t x 2 t x n t and the transition from a pre decision state variable to the post decision state variable using the control u t as x t h x t u t the utility of this decomposition is that instead of solving eq 8 which is numerically intractable we can solve for an approximate value function v that gives an near optimal control policy 12 u x t a r g m a x u r x t u t γ v x t 1 here u x t is the combination of controls maximizing the right hand term then the approximate value function is updated at the previous pre decision state x t given the post decision state dynamics temporal difference learning is used to update the approximate value function the algorithm adapted from powell 2007 is based on two nested loops for n k support states the inner loop stores the value of the states visited during the loop in the array v τ i n for τ 1 τ m a x when this loop is over after τ m a x iterations a value function estimate is obtained by interpolating with a gp v t o u t this second gp termed the value gp is not to be confused with the edm gp used to approximate the dynamics the value gp takes the state of the system as input and returns its approximate value the value of the support states at the end of the inner loop v τ m a x i n x k 1 is used to update the value gp the outer loop refines the value function approximation by sampling new trajectories from the support states the outer loop ends after t m a x times or if a convergence criterion is reached we define convergence as v t o u t v t 1 o u t ϵ 1 γ γ ensuring that v o u t v t 1 o u t ϵ the inner loop is illustrated in fig 2 starting from a state x k 1 the current decision u k τ is found by solving eq 13 based on the current knowledge of the state s value v t 1 o u t x k 1 its value is stored in the array v 1 i n the post decision state using u k τ is computed and the next pre decision x k 2 state is sampled using the edm gp at each iteration we refine the value of x k 1 using the subsequent states values as shown in eq 15 after computing trajectories made of τ m a x iterations we update the value gp using v τ m a x i n x k 1 as shown in fig 2 and we restart the process starting from the same initial support states x k 1 the value function is then iteratively updated until we reach convergence or a maximum of iterations the number of support states i e the sample size n k the inner loop maximum iteration τ m a x and the outer loop maximum iteration t m a x are experimentally fixed to 50 5 and 100 respectively applications that differ substantially in the state dimension control dimension and degree of predictability will likely need to modify these values to ensure good algorithm performance 3 study cases 3 1 setup we evaluate the performance of the algorithm on three different scenarios determining trade offs in two and five species systems one natural benchmark for comparison is the optimal policy based on the true i e data generating dynamics since we are attempting to infer the dynamics from short time series and using an approximate dynamic programming algorithm to compute the policy we expect the algorithm to produce long term rewards that are less than optimal and our primary interest is in evaluating what is lost in terms of the long term reward by not knowing exactly how the system works and approximating the policy with adp most harvest control rules are derived from single species models collie et al 2014 holsman et al 2016 skern mauritzen et al 2016 this effectively treats as noise the influence of other species on the dynamics of the focal species so another highly relevant benchmark is the performance of these single species policies here we expect the edp algorithm to outperform the single species policies and our primary interest is in how much can be gained by accounting for species interactions in a flexible manner using the edm gp to characterize the results we determine both the expected and realized pareto fronts the expected pareto front is the front based on the inferred dynamics which approximately optimizes the policy this is the front produced by the algorithm given the data it is all that would be available in any real decision problem in contrast the realized pareto front is produced by implementing the derived policy within the data generating model hence the realized front captures how the policy would perform in real life for each of the simulation models we generate a training set which consists of time series of the controls and state variables in order to do so we need to specify some model for the harvesting dynamics here we assume that the control history follows a bioeconomic rule clark 1993 the harvesting effort increases if the current catch is larger than the previous catch if the catch decreases the harvesting is strongly reduced specifically 18 u t u t 1 0 2 1 u t 1 if u t 1 x t 1 u t 2 x t 2 0 4 u t 1 else 3 2 a two species predator prey system in this section we consider a two species predator prey model known in fisheries as the two species ricker model luís et al 2011 it is a discrete time analog of the lotka volterra lotka 1920 predator prey model the dynamics are given by 19 x 1 t 1 s 1 t e r 1 a 1 s 1 t b 1 s 2 t ω 1 t x 2 t 1 s 2 t e r 2 a 2 s 2 t b 2 s 1 t ω 2 t where species 1 is the prey and species 2 is the predator with r 1 r 2 3 a 1 a 2 2 b 1 0 5 b 2 0 3 and the noise ω 1 t ω 2 t n 0 0 01 in this scenario both species are harvested and the goal is to identify the trade off between harvesting at different trophic levels using the edp algorithm for comparison the single species policies for this scenario are derived by ignoring the interaction terms fitting two single species ricker models i e x i t 1 s i t e r i a i s i t ζ 1 t and using these to determine independent harvest rates note that although not typically the case in this instance the single species model can be obtained by marginalizing the over the other species setting r i r i b i s j produces a single species model that has the right shape on average consequently we expect that the single species policies should perform fairly well in this scenario note that the 1 d parametric form is correct on average by considering interspecies interactions as noise so a one dimensional gp is expected to perform similarly boettiger et al 2015 previously evaluated using gp edm to manage a single species with a single control relative to correct and incorrectly specified parametric models so we do not repeat this here a typical time series from this model is shown in fig 3 in which the control history is specified by a bio economic model the simulated series is used to fit the multi species edm gp and the single species models the estimated models are inserted into the td algorithm to generate near optimal policies we benchmark the policies to the ones obtained using the sdp algorithm based on the true dynamics 19 the expected pareto front and the realized pareto fronts are calculated from 40 linearly spaced values of the weight associated to species 1 reward w 1 between 0 and 1 and w 2 1 w 1 gathering these rewards gives the pareto fronts shown in fig 4 the resulting value pairs form two distinct sets that depend on which species is the most valuable e g the points on the upper left correspond to low valued prey hence small values of w 1 the policies and pareto front obtained using the edm gp to approximate the dynamics are very close to those obtained using the true model in contrast policies computed using the single species models result in a small cluster of points close to the center of each plot intuitively since each species was optimized independently the pair of single species policies lead to similar steady states regardless of the relative value of revenues from each because of its computational tractability this two species scenario also permits us to compare the near optimal policies obtained with the td algorithm to the exact optimal policies computed using classical dynamic programming to do so we repeated this exercise for 100 replicate simulations we compute the mean square difference between the realized value functions determined using both sdp and the td algorithm based on the true dynamics the edm gp and the single species models 20 e r r v i j v i ref e v i j v i ref 2 v a r v i ref the results are summarized in table 1 the expected long run value error is around 5 using the edm gp and 14 using the single species model the realized long run value error is around 8 using the edm gp and 34 using the single species model the variance in the results is greatly impacted by the type of model used as we can see with the single species errors standard deviation between 21 and 140 using the td algorithm adds an other level of error the expected long run value error is around 6 using the true model around 15 using the edm gp and 20 using the single species model the realized long run value error is around 4 using the true model around 7 using the edm gp and 32 using the single species model it is worth noting that the expected long run value error is more impacted by the choice of the algorithm than the realized long run value error this indicates that although the td algorithm distorted the value function it did so in a way that does not affecting the policy to compare the performance of two policies we also determined the mean square difference in long run value of the i th objective with the optimal reward i e the reward produced using sdp and the true model and compute the ratio 21 g v i 1 v i 2 v i ref e v i 2 v i ref 2 v i 2 v i ref 2 v i 1 v i ref 2 g close to 1 means that the policy 1 gives results closer to the reference policy than the policy 2 g close to 0 means that the policy 2 gives results closer to the reference policy than the policy 1 g around 0 5 means that both policies give similar results the results are summarized in table 2 the ratio is always over 0 5 which means that the gp policy performs better than the single species policy this result is slightly reduced when using the td algorithm for the expected long run value however the realized long run values are equivalent 3 3 a five species system next we illustrate the scalability of edp by applying it to a 5 species system with two trophic levels this scenario is analogous to the historical herring fishery in the n e us hartman 2003 dalton et al 2009 in which river herrings i e blueback herring alosa aestivalis and alewife a pseudoharengus are harvested together and are preyed upon by striped bass morone saxatilis and double crested cormorant phalacrocorax auritus the striped bass is an economically important fishery target while double crested cormorant is a species of conservation concern in keeping with this our model includes three prey species and two predators the prey are harvested collectively i e u 1 t u 2 t u 3 t u p r e y one predator species 4 is harvested at rate u p r e d independent of the prey while the other predator species 5 is a conservation target hence in this scenario there are five species two controls and three objectives to simulate this system we use a 5 species ricker model the parameters of the system have been chosen to generate co existing populations 22 x 1 t 1 s 1 t e 1 0213 s 1 t 0 0861 s 2 t 0 3141 s 3 t 0 7252 s 4 t 0 2445 x 5 t ε 1 t x 2 t 1 s 2 t e 1 0289 0 4765 s 1 t s 2 t 0 1370 s 3 t 0 9811 s 4 t 0 0915 x 5 t ε 2 t x 3 t 1 s 3

ε 5 t the scalarized reward function for this scenario is 23 r x t u t w 1 i 1 3 x i t u p r e y w 2 x 4 t u p r e d w 3 x 5 t with w 1 w 2 w 3 1 with w j 0 1 hence when w 1 1 the focus is only on harvesting the prey when w 2 1 the focus is only on harvesting predator 1 and when w 3 1 the focus is solely on conserving the second predator with a 5 d state space stochastic dynamic programming is not computationally tractable as a result we limit our evaluation of the results to those generated using the td algorithm based either on the true model or the gp model in addition we benchmark the performance of our edp approach against the more commonly used single species models to do so a collection of single species ricker models is fitted independently to the data for each species and used to generate single species harvest policies the difference in long run values obtained using the wrong model and the true model are shown in fig 5 overall the edp policies results are closer to the true model ones than the single species policies results for an small subset of weightings the single species policies results are closest but the total weighted yield is equivalent the white area in fig 5 i fig 6 shows the expected left and realized right pareto fronts the expected fronts given by the true model policies and the edp policies are close to each other again since the single species policies are not flexible when there are several objectives the front is just a point that said we note that the single species policies are fine when the value of the prey is high that fits with the white area in fig 5 i in addition note that since the predators do not interact directly there is a 1 1 correspondence between prey yield and the abundance of predator 2 hence the pareto front is a curve in 3 d rather than a fully developed surface 4 discussion we evaluated edp for 2 and 5 species systems the cases we evaluated cover common trade offs in multi species management including trade offs in yield when managing two different trophic levels and trade offs between harvesting prey and conserving a dependent predator to place our work in the broader context of modeling for decision support e g schuwirth et al 2019 we have assumed that the management objectives are known and the input current state of each species and output variables future state of each species are accessible directly from the observed time series we further assumed that the system dynamics were adequately captured calibrated and validated using edm following standard practices sugihara et al 2012 deyle et al 2016 munch et al 2018 in typical management problems unmanageable drivers are those that are outside of our control but still contribute to the dynamics for example when harvesting prey only the predator is an unmanageable driver this manifests in the state dependence of the edm gp to some extent we expect that using time lags e g takens 1981 sugihara 1994 will allow us to compensate for other unobserved unmanageable drivers though this is the focus of a subsequent paper finally our results are restricted to settings where the dynamics of the system are expected to remain constant or change slowly through time in cases where known drivers are expected to change we suggest that edm gp forecasts be assessed regularly relevant changes to the dynamics will be detectable as a marked change in forecast accuracy we have found that it is possible to construct accurate approximations of the expected pareto front using edp whose policies are robust to structural uncertainties i e they work even though we do not have an explicit mathematical model for the system their performance is typically quite close to optimal both in terms of harvesting and conservation goals in contrast the single species policies typically did not perform as well since they ignore interactions with other species this leads to rigid policies which can perform badly when applied to the multi species dynamics for example the optimal harvest of prey can be greater when predators are absent while the optimal harvesting of predators requires that prey remain sufficiently abundant without state dependent policies that include both species either one objective or the other will be compromised our results on the 5d system in particular illustrate the need for handling interactions between species to build efficient policies strong interactions lead to high discrepancies in pareto fronts highlighting our interest in using a non parametric forecasting method rather than a potentially incorrect parametric model however if the target species does not have strong interactions with others single species policies may be adequate although the simulation results shown here are generally quite positive there are several caveats to note in the application of edp first the time series used to estimate the gp must be sufficient to allow the dynamics to be reconstructed in cases where the time series are too short or trace out only a small portion of the feasible state space we should expect edp to generate sub optimal policies to avoid this we recommend first evaluating the out of sample performance of the gp or other forecasting algorithm second a good value function approximation method is critical although beyond the scope of our formal investigation we found that the support states may influence td policy computation particularly when the number of dimensions is high when the dimension is low a regular grid of states may be used to generate a near optimal policy everywhere in the state space however as the number of dimensions increases this solution is no longer available it is therefore useful to include some specific states of interest such as estimates of the current population sizes moreover although we used a gp to approximate the value function other interpolation methods could easily be used e g splines radial basis functions etc these will clearly have different advantages and drawbacks that vary with the specific problem regardless of the function approximation method employed poor approximations lead to computational instability hence care is required in choosing an approximation method after trying piece wise constant and polynomial methods we settled on the gp for value function interpolation as it gave the best overall performance third we have focused strictly on identifying an optimal harvest policy recent work has highlighted how such optimal policies may perform poorly under other decision criteria such as long term sustainability or remaining within a safe operating space barfuss et al 2018 however sustainability and safe operating spaces can be recast as optimal control problems with suitably modified rewards doyen and de lara 2010 tipping points can be avoided similarly see wu and lin 1999 borkar and meyn 2002 defourny et al 2008 for examples of these risk sensitive rewards though we have previously found boettiger et al 2015 that tipping points are naturally avoided in edp because the variance of edm predictions goes up in unexplored parts of the state space nevertheless appending additional objectives for sustainability and safe operating spaces to the edp framework is an important next step fourth edp cannot hope to handle strongly nonstationary and or exogenously forced dynamics or problems with incompatible objectives in this case incorporating data on relevant external drivers may improve forecasts but as with parametric approaches to modeling the resulting edp policy will be sensitive to our assumptions about the behavior of drivers in the future very large state spaces with high dimensional attractors are also problematic as it is difficult to reconstruct the dynamics we therefore recommend that any application of edp begin by testing the forecast accuracy of the edm gp although here we have focused on trade offs between harvesting and conservation goals the edp algorithm is quite general and could be applied to other problems in ecosystem management it is therefore worth noting what parts would have to be modified the most obvious is that in other cases the rewards and controls would be different here we have assumed that the controls modify the states in a known way specifically that we remove a known fraction of the population in other settings alternate controls such as outplanting individuals of different species or modifying nutrient input rates may be relevant in more general problems where the response of the system to the controls is not known a priori we would fit the gp to the time series of both states and controls i e x t 1 f x t u t however increasing the input dimension to the gp will require longer time series to achieve similar forecast accuracy ecosystem models are often strongly sensitive to assumptions about species interactions making it difficult to assess the robustness of conservation and management plans that depend on them importantly there is no way of knowing the true dynamics in real world systems and optimal control approaches are not feasible alternative approaches to ecosystem management that produce demonstrably optimal policies despite large structural uncertainties are needed as a first step in this direction edp provides a platform for producing near optimal policies directly from observed system dynamics without specifying an ecosystem model we expect that this will be of use in many areas of ecosystem management credit authorship contribution statement antoine brias

24673,control theory and stochastic dynamic programming have long been used to develop optimal single species management policies however most species interact with others through competition and predation as parts of complex ecosystems as a consequence it is unclear how far from optimal the single species policies currently in use actually are moreover there are as yet no scalable algorithms for optimal ecosystem management here we merge recently developed tools from machine learning and nonlinear dynamics to construct and evaluate near optimal policies in multi species systems specifically a non parametric model for the dynamics is estimated from time series data using gaussian process based dynamic modeling a policy is then derived from the inferred dynamics using a temporal difference learning algorithm policy performance is benchmarked against single species policies and the ad hoc ecosystem policies that have been previously offered we found that edp policies are closer to the true optimal policies than single species policies in multi species systems with two controls and three objectives the pareto fronts illustrate the flexibility of edp policies compared with single species policies keywords multi species management multi objectives management non linear methods approximate dynamic programming gaussian process regression temporal difference learning code accessibility a matlab implementation of the edp package can be found at https github com antoinebrias edp 1 introduction the sustainable management of natural resources is an urgent concern with many parties calling for ecosystem based approaches pikitch et al 2004 fletcher et al 2010 fulton et al 2014 there are many good reasons for doing so pikitch et al 2004 fogarty 2014 perhaps the most pragmatic of which is that an ecosystem approach requires us to be explicit about the trade offs that occur between competing uses of the system here we focus on trade offs that may occur between and within the objectives of conservation and harvesting most obviously extractive uses may impede conservation goals such as protecting endangered species and maintaining biodiversity venter et al 2006 smith 2011 pennino et al 2018 for example koehn et al 2017 explored the trade offs between forage fish harvesting and non market predators in the california current observing large reductions in biomass of seabirds such as brown pelicans and marble murrelets sea lions and baleen whales similarly in forest management there are trade offs between timber extraction and the availability of suitable wildlife habitat davis et al 2017 trade offs between disparate exploitative uses of an ecosystem have also been studied extensively clark 1993 in marine systems harvesting forage species e g for conversion to fish meal reduces the harvestable biomass of dependent predators in mangrove ecosystems coastal fisheries may be negatively impacted by forestry activity which reduces the mangrove ecosystem services such as habitat food and good water quality grasso 1998 finally conservation and restoration efforts may also be in tension for instance the removal of invasive marsh grass spartina alterniflora resulted in the decline of the endangered california rail rallus obsoletus obsoletus which used spartina for cover and nest materials schroder et al 2016 hence it is common for policy makers to face conflicts between food production wealth generation restoration and conservation see e g crutchfield 2004 charles 2009 in order for managers to balance these competing objectives in a rational and transparent way we need to quantify the trade offs among them one approach is to identify a single common currency to be optimized e g dollars see laurila pant et al 2015 for a review of valuation techniques however the trade offs considered here involve inherently disparate values e g revenues and biodiversity that are not easily distilled to a single objective multi objective optimization allows us to quantify trade offs among disparate goals by identifying the set of trade off solutions williams and kendall 2017 which are optimal policies corresponding to different weights for each objective the resulting set of values defines a curve 2 objectives or surface more known as the pareto front or efficiency frontier conservation and management problems have been addressed via multi objective optimization approaches for many year walters and hilborn 1978 mardle and pascoe 1999 bulte and horan 2003 diaz balteiro and romero 2008 higgins et al 2008 kennedy et al 2008 williams and kendall 2017 for instance lafond et al 2017 identified efficient management scenarios of uneven aged mountain forests illustrating the impact of considering additional ecosystem services in optimal control process and highlighting the advantages e g providing trade off scenarios and the weaknesses e g computational cost of the pareto front method in a marine example cheung and sumaila 2008 showed that management of the northern south china sea is currently sub optimal in both conservation and economic objectives and proposed trade off solutions for future management policies to date the use of multi objective approaches in ecosystem management has been limited to small state spaces for which the system dynamics are assumed known the past three decades have witnessed major advances in ecosystem modeling in marine systems the state of the art includes spatial models such as the atlantis gom with 91 species driven by realistic currents and climatology grüss et al 2018 spatially explicit models have been used widely to evaluate various multi species management strategies mahévas and pelletier 2004 pikitch et al 2004 however these exercises typically evaluate the performance of ad hoc policies rather than identify optimal control rules the breadth and complexity of these models which lends them their realism also prevent us from running the vast number of iterations required to identify optimal policies as a consequence it is impossible to know how far the resulting policies are from being optimal moreover despite dramatic increases in the complexity and realism of ecosystem models they are still far from complete there are numerous state variables and interactions that have been omitted including for instance individual variation in traits bolnick et al 2011 genetic variation and contemporary evolution ellner et al 2011 and non consumptive interactions peckarsky et al 2008 there is mounting evidences that these missing state variables and interactions may have strong influences on ecological dynamics werner and peacor 2003 and the forecast accuracy of ecosystem models is rarely tested petchey et al 2015 this structural uncertainty williams 2001 cressie et al 2009 athanassoglou and xepapadeas 2012 is increasingly acknowledged in ecological models and fisheries ecosystems charles 1998 plagányi 2007 hence there is a need for a multi objective decision framework that is suitable for realistic state spaces with incompletely specified dynamics empirical dynamic modeling edm circumvents the problem of incompletely specified ecological dynamics perretti et al 2013 munch et al 2017 non parametric methods based on nonlinear dynamics and time delay embedding outperform parametric models in both forecasting perretti et al 2013 and management boettiger et al 2015 for simulated data in addition to successful applications for specific species ye et al 2015 deyle et al 2018 a recent meta analysis of 185 fish populations indicates that edm outperforms i e make more accurate short term predications standard fisheries parametric models for 90 percent of the populations studied munch et al 2018 for a 1 d system boettiger et al 2015 showed that edm could be used to generate robust harvest policies that produce near optimal yields while avoiding tipping points due to allee effects hence if sufficient data are available it is feasible that we could use edm in a multi objective setting to manage ecosystems however existing simulations have been restricted to single objectives and relatively small systems since it is rarely possible to compute an optimal harvest policy analytically numerical methods must be employed stochastic dynamic programming sdp has long been the tool of choice for sequential decision problems mangel and clark 1988 mangel 2015 for example sdp has been used to identify optimal harvest policies in single and two species fisheries poudel et al 2012 boettiger et al 2015 although sdp has become increasingly important in natural resource management and conservation planning shea and possingham 2000 milner gulland 1997 the tractability of sdp in ecosystem management is limited to small state and control spaces see e g ramirez and saunders 1999 shea and possingham 2000 in larger systems with multiple decision makers and uncertain dynamics success is more limited sdp models scale poorly with the dimension of the state and control such that optimizing management of more than 3 or 4 species via sdp is computationally impractical a variety of algorithms have been developed to ameliorate the computational burden of sdp known collectively as approximate dynamic programming adp algorithms such as temporal difference td learning allow us to compute a near optimal harvest policy in larger state spaces however td has not been widely used on ecosystem management problems and it is unclear how close to optimal the resulting policies will be for typical ecological problems based on these considerations we introduce a multi objective framework for multi species management based on edm and adp which we refer to as empirical dynamic programming edp the approach computes near optimal policies for balancing trade offs among several competing objectives without the need to specify a model for the ecosystem or community dynamics after introducing the algorithm we first determine how close a policy based on edm comes to the correct optimal policy and whether it outperforms policy from an incorrect single species model we do this in a two species system where it is feasible to compute the optimal policy using traditional sdp in this setting we also evaluate how close adp policies are to the true optimal policies following this we illustrate the algorithm s performance with an additional example which illustrates the scalability of our algorithm by computing near optimal policies in a five species system in this system management attempts to balance yields from two distinct trophic levels while maintaining the abundance of a protected species that interacts with them 2 methods our goal is to construct a near optimal multi species and multi objective management policies based directly on the observed behavior of the system the main steps are 1 using edm to forecast the future state of the ecosystem given the current state and control 2 use sdp or adp to determine the optimal near optimal policy shown schematically in fig 1 2 1 model free forecasting using gaussian process we begin by describing the ecosystem dynamics and the edm forecasting algorithm in principle the algorithm we present applies to general state and control spaces in which there are n state variables m controls and m may be greater than or less than n the state variables may in general represent such things as population sizes habitat quality parameters and other factors that contribute to the dynamics the controls may in general represent such things as harvest rates rates of outplanting nutrient loadings etc however for clarity of exposition we focus specifically on multi species harvesting and conservation problems important differences between the harvesting algorithm and more general ecosystem management are described in the discussion say we have a system composed of n species whose abundance either counts or biomass at time t is given by x t x 1 t x 2 t x n t x r n the controls u t u 1 t u 2 t u n t u r n indicate the fraction of each population removed at time t species that are not harvested have u i t fixed at 0 the system dynamics are given by some unknown set of equations h i 1 x i t 1 h i x t u t w t where w t represents some process stochasticity we assume that these unknown dynamics can be approximated using a log gaussian process takens 1981 munch et al 2017 specifically 2 x i t 1 s i t e f i s 1 t s 2 t s n t ε i t 3 ε i t i d d n 0 ν i where 4 s i t x i t 1 u i t again x i t and u i t are the state and the control for species i at time t and ε i t are the uncertainties in the dynamics for each species the shape of each f i is unknown must be estimated from the available data we model f i using gaussian process gp regression rasmussen and williams 2006 and we define the gp regression g called edm gp hereafter to avoid confusion which takes as input the current state x t and the current control of the system u t and gives the next state as output 5 x t 1 g x t u t w t where ω t represents the stochasticity because our focus is on control rather than forecasting the gp is trained using all the data points in the time series we suggest that the forecast accuracy of the edm gp be established on out of sample data before edp is undertaken e g munch et al 2017 gps have been used in classification and regression e g gibbs and mackay 1997 williams 1998 and more recently in ecological modeling munch et al 2005 2017 the gp is a continuous generalization of the multivariate normal distribution completely defined by its mean and a covariance functions in the absence of strong prior information on the shape of f i we set the prior mean to zero so that f i gp 0 k i the covariance functions k i control the flexibility of the estimated functions in keeping with past applications munch et al 2017 2018 we used the squared exponential covariance given by 6 the hyperparameters ν i τ i and φ i j of the edm gp respectively correspond to the process variance the pointwise prior variance in f and the lag specific length scale parameters respectively independent diffuse b e t a 1 1 1 1 priors are used on ν i v a r s i and τ i v a r s i to constrain the variance in the predicted population at a given current state to be less than twice the observed total variance allowing τ i to be unbounded creates numerical convergence issues that have little impact on the fit to the data beyond twice the observed variance the likelihood for τ i is relatively flat increasing these parameters any further cannot improve the fit in a meaningful way so this constraint improves convergence without sacrificing fit following an argument from munch et al 2017 a prior is used for φ i j to control the wiggliness of the estimated function by setting the expected number of local extrema to 1 along each axis specifically we set half normal prior φ i j 2 e φ i j 2 2 v 2 π v as detailed in munch et al 2017 setting v π 12 means that f has on average one local extremum over the range of the data scaled to lie between 0 and 1 given this specification the edm gp is fit to available data by maximizing the posterior over choices of the hyperparameters using the r prop algorithm riedmiller and braun 1993 predictions for any new system state conditional on the training data are made with the hyperparameters set to the posterior mode see munch et al 2017 for further details 2 2 dynamic programming for ecosystem management our goal is to identify policies that balance management and conservation goals to do so we use sdp or adp to maximize the long run discounted reward for each species r i u i t x i t for harvested species the reward at time t is given by the portion of the population captured i e r i u i t x i t u i t x i t for conserved species the reward is simply the current population size i e r i u i t x i t x i t harvesting costs can be incorporated directly e g r i u i t x i t u i t x i t c h u i t x i t if the catchability function h is known other objectives are certainly possible such as minimizing extinction risk senina et al 1999 or the spreading the age distribution brunel and piet 2013 these can be incorporated into this framework fairly easily provided that the data are available to effectively reconstruct the dynamics of the relevant state variables given these rewards we want to find the policy u x i e the set of controls for each possible system state that maximizes each of the long run average discounted rewards j to construct the pareto front we use the scalarization trick roijers et al 2013 in which we combine the objectives using a set of weights w i which we then vary between 0 and 1 γ is called the discount factor which gives information on the importance of a reward in the future compared to the current reward 7 j i 1 n w i t 0 γ t r i x i t u i t in order to find the optimal policy we introduce the value function v x t which satisfies the dynamic programming equation clark 1993 8 v x t m a x u t r x t u t γ e v x t 1 x t u t with 9 r x t u t i 1 n w i r i x i t u i t v x t represents the long run average reward for the system given that we start in state x t although implicitly defined by 8 the value function must be found numerically which is the core the dynamic programming algorithm the global reward r 9 is a weighted sum of the relative objective specific rewards note that when only one objective matters one weight is set to 1 and all others to 0 to facilitate interpretability across incommensurate units we have scaled the relative rewards by this single objective maximum for example in a 2 species system where we are interested in harvesting species 1 for example r 1 u 1 t x 1 t u 1 t x 1 t and conserving species 2 for example r 2 u 2 t x 2 t x 2 t the weighting w 1 0 1 and w 2 0 9 would indicate a high priority for conserving species 2 when the value function associated to a policy u x for every state x is larger or equal to the value of any other policy the policy is said to be optimal puterman 2005 for a small system with 1 2 or 3 dimensions the long run average reward can be computed using dynamic programming poudel et al 2012 boettiger et al 2015 but when the number of dimensions increases sdp becomes computationally infeasible to overcome this computational hurdle we use an approximate dynamic programming algorithm based on temporal difference learning sutton 1988 as suggested by powell 2007 we break the original transition function 2 into two steps 10 x i t s i t e f i s 1 t s 2 t s n t and 11 x i t 1 x i t e ε i t where f i s 1 t s 2 t s n t is the posterior mean and ε i t i d d n 0 ν i we refer to x i t as the post decision state variable for each species which captures the state of the system following the implementation of the control powell 2007 the post decision state is a deterministic function of x t and u t x i t is then called the pre decision state variable we denote the post decision state as x t x 1 t x 2 t x n t and the transition from a pre decision state variable to the post decision state variable using the control u t as x t h x t u t the utility of this decomposition is that instead of solving eq 8 which is numerically intractable we can solve for an approximate value function v that gives an near optimal control policy 12 u x t a r g m a x u r x t u t γ v x t 1 here u x t is the combination of controls maximizing the right hand term then the approximate value function is updated at the previous pre decision state x t given the post decision state dynamics temporal difference learning is used to update the approximate value function the algorithm adapted from powell 2007 is based on two nested loops for n k support states the inner loop stores the value of the states visited during the loop in the array v τ i n for τ 1 τ m a x when this loop is over after τ m a x iterations a value function estimate is obtained by interpolating with a gp v t o u t this second gp termed the value gp is not to be confused with the edm gp used to approximate the dynamics the value gp takes the state of the system as input and returns its approximate value the value of the support states at the end of the inner loop v τ m a x i n x k 1 is used to update the value gp the outer loop refines the value function approximation by sampling new trajectories from the support states the outer loop ends after t m a x times or if a convergence criterion is reached we define convergence as v t o u t v t 1 o u t ϵ 1 γ γ ensuring that v o u t v t 1 o u t ϵ the inner loop is illustrated in fig 2 starting from a state x k 1 the current decision u k τ is found by solving eq 13 based on the current knowledge of the state s value v t 1 o u t x k 1 its value is stored in the array v 1 i n the post decision state using u k τ is computed and the next pre decision x k 2 state is sampled using the edm gp at each iteration we refine the value of x k 1 using the subsequent states values as shown in eq 15 after computing trajectories made of τ m a x iterations we update the value gp using v τ m a x i n x k 1 as shown in fig 2 and we restart the process starting from the same initial support states x k 1 the value function is then iteratively updated until we reach convergence or a maximum of iterations the number of support states i e the sample size n k the inner loop maximum iteration τ m a x and the outer loop maximum iteration t m a x are experimentally fixed to 50 5 and 100 respectively applications that differ substantially in the state dimension control dimension and degree of predictability will likely need to modify these values to ensure good algorithm performance 3 study cases 3 1 setup we evaluate the performance of the algorithm on three different scenarios determining trade offs in two and five species systems one natural benchmark for comparison is the optimal policy based on the true i e data generating dynamics since we are attempting to infer the dynamics from short time series and using an approximate dynamic programming algorithm to compute the policy we expect the algorithm to produce long term rewards that are less than optimal and our primary interest is in evaluating what is lost in terms of the long term reward by not knowing exactly how the system works and approximating the policy with adp most harvest control rules are derived from single species models collie et al 2014 holsman et al 2016 skern mauritzen et al 2016 this effectively treats as noise the influence of other species on the dynamics of the focal species so another highly relevant benchmark is the performance of these single species policies here we expect the edp algorithm to outperform the single species policies and our primary interest is in how much can be gained by accounting for species interactions in a flexible manner using the edm gp to characterize the results we determine both the expected and realized pareto fronts the expected pareto front is the front based on the inferred dynamics which approximately optimizes the policy this is the front produced by the algorithm given the data it is all that would be available in any real decision problem in contrast the realized pareto front is produced by implementing the derived policy within the data generating model hence the realized front captures how the policy would perform in real life for each of the simulation models we generate a training set which consists of time series of the controls and state variables in order to do so we need to specify some model for the harvesting dynamics here we assume that the control history follows a bioeconomic rule clark 1993 the harvesting effort increases if the current catch is larger than the previous catch if the catch decreases the harvesting is strongly reduced specifically 18 u t u t 1 0 2 1 u t 1 if u t 1 x t 1 u t 2 x t 2 0 4 u t 1 else 3 2 a two species predator prey system in this section we consider a two species predator prey model known in fisheries as the two species ricker model luís et al 2011 it is a discrete time analog of the lotka volterra lotka 1920 predator prey model the dynamics are given by 19 x 1 t 1 s 1 t e r 1 a 1 s 1 t b 1 s 2 t ω 1 t x 2 t 1 s 2 t e r 2 a 2 s 2 t b 2 s 1 t ω 2 t where species 1 is the prey and species 2 is the predator with r 1 r 2 3 a 1 a 2 2 b 1 0 5 b 2 0 3 and the noise ω 1 t ω 2 t n 0 0 01 in this scenario both species are harvested and the goal is to identify the trade off between harvesting at different trophic levels using the edp algorithm for comparison the single species policies for this scenario are derived by ignoring the interaction terms fitting two single species ricker models i e x i t 1 s i t e r i a i s i t ζ 1 t and using these to determine independent harvest rates note that although not typically the case in this instance the single species model can be obtained by marginalizing the over the other species setting r i r i b i s j produces a single species model that has the right shape on average consequently we expect that the single species policies should perform fairly well in this scenario note that the 1 d parametric form is correct on average by considering interspecies interactions as noise so a one dimensional gp is expected to perform similarly boettiger et al 2015 previously evaluated using gp edm to manage a single species with a single control relative to correct and incorrectly specified parametric models so we do not repeat this here a typical time series from this model is shown in fig 3 in which the control history is specified by a bio economic model the simulated series is used to fit the multi species edm gp and the single species models the estimated models are inserted into the td algorithm to generate near optimal policies we benchmark the policies to the ones obtained using the sdp algorithm based on the true dynamics 19 the expected pareto front and the realized pareto fronts are calculated from 40 linearly spaced values of the weight associated to species 1 reward w 1 between 0 and 1 and w 2 1 w 1 gathering these rewards gives the pareto fronts shown in fig 4 the resulting value pairs form two distinct sets that depend on which species is the most valuable e g the points on the upper left correspond to low valued prey hence small values of w 1 the policies and pareto front obtained using the edm gp to approximate the dynamics are very close to those obtained using the true model in contrast policies computed using the single species models result in a small cluster of points close to the center of each plot intuitively since each species was optimized independently the pair of single species policies lead to similar steady states regardless of the relative value of revenues from each because of its computational tractability this two species scenario also permits us to compare the near optimal policies obtained with the td algorithm to the exact optimal policies computed using classical dynamic programming to do so we repeated this exercise for 100 replicate simulations we compute the mean square difference between the realized value functions determined using both sdp and the td algorithm based on the true dynamics the edm gp and the single species models 20 e r r v i j v i ref e v i j v i ref 2 v a r v i ref the results are summarized in table 1 the expected long run value error is around 5 using the edm gp and 14 using the single species model the realized long run value error is around 8 using the edm gp and 34 using the single species model the variance in the results is greatly impacted by the type of model used as we can see with the single species errors standard deviation between 21 and 140 using the td algorithm adds an other level of error the expected long run value error is around 6 using the true model around 15 using the edm gp and 20 using the single species model the realized long run value error is around 4 using the true model around 7 using the edm gp and 32 using the single species model it is worth noting that the expected long run value error is more impacted by the choice of the algorithm than the realized long run value error this indicates that although the td algorithm distorted the value function it did so in a way that does not affecting the policy to compare the performance of two policies we also determined the mean square difference in long run value of the i th objective with the optimal reward i e the reward produced using sdp and the true model and compute the ratio 21 g v i 1 v i 2 v i ref e v i 2 v i ref 2 v i 2 v i ref 2 v i 1 v i ref 2 g close to 1 means that the policy 1 gives results closer to the reference policy than the policy 2 g close to 0 means that the policy 2 gives results closer to the reference policy than the policy 1 g around 0 5 means that both policies give similar results the results are summarized in table 2 the ratio is always over 0 5 which means that the gp policy performs better than the single species policy this result is slightly reduced when using the td algorithm for the expected long run value however the realized long run values are equivalent 3 3 a five species system next we illustrate the scalability of edp by applying it to a 5 species system with two trophic levels this scenario is analogous to the historical herring fishery in the n e us hartman 2003 dalton et al 2009 in which river herrings i e blueback herring alosa aestivalis and alewife a pseudoharengus are harvested together and are preyed upon by striped bass morone saxatilis and double crested cormorant phalacrocorax auritus the striped bass is an economically important fishery target while double crested cormorant is a species of conservation concern in keeping with this our model includes three prey species and two predators the prey are harvested collectively i e u 1 t u 2 t u 3 t u p r e y one predator species 4 is harvested at rate u p r e d independent of the prey while the other predator species 5 is a conservation target hence in this scenario there are five species two controls and three objectives to simulate this system we use a 5 species ricker model the parameters of the system have been chosen to generate co existing populations 22 x 1 t 1 s 1 t e 1 0213 s 1 t 0 0861 s 2 t 0 3141 s 3 t 0 7252 s 4 t 0 2445 x 5 t ε 1 t x 2 t 1 s 2 t e 1 0289 0 4765 s 1 t s 2 t 0 1370 s 3 t 0 9811 s 4 t 0 0915 x 5 t ε 2 t x 3 t 1 s 3

ε 5 t the scalarized reward function for this scenario is 23 r x t u t w 1 i 1 3 x i t u p r e y w 2 x 4 t u p r e d w 3 x 5 t with w 1 w 2 w 3 1 with w j 0 1 hence when w 1 1 the focus is only on harvesting the prey when w 2 1 the focus is only on harvesting predator 1 and when w 3 1 the focus is solely on conserving the second predator with a 5 d state space stochastic dynamic programming is not computationally tractable as a result we limit our evaluation of the results to those generated using the td algorithm based either on the true model or the gp model in addition we benchmark the performance of our edp approach against the more commonly used single species models to do so a collection of single species ricker models is fitted independently to the data for each species and used to generate single species harvest policies the difference in long run values obtained using the wrong model and the true model are shown in fig 5 overall the edp policies results are closer to the true model ones than the single species policies results for an small subset of weightings the single species policies results are closest but the total weighted yield is equivalent the white area in fig 5 i fig 6 shows the expected left and realized right pareto fronts the expected fronts given by the true model policies and the edp policies are close to each other again since the single species policies are not flexible when there are several objectives the front is just a point that said we note that the single species policies are fine when the value of the prey is high that fits with the white area in fig 5 i in addition note that since the predators do not interact directly there is a 1 1 correspondence between prey yield and the abundance of predator 2 hence the pareto front is a curve in 3 d rather than a fully developed surface 4 discussion we evaluated edp for 2 and 5 species systems the cases we evaluated cover common trade offs in multi species management including trade offs in yield when managing two different trophic levels and trade offs between harvesting prey and conserving a dependent predator to place our work in the broader context of modeling for decision support e g schuwirth et al 2019 we have assumed that the management objectives are known and the input current state of each species and output variables future state of each species are accessible directly from the observed time series we further assumed that the system dynamics were adequately captured calibrated and validated using edm following standard practices sugihara et al 2012 deyle et al 2016 munch et al 2018 in typical management problems unmanageable drivers are those that are outside of our control but still contribute to the dynamics for example when harvesting prey only the predator is an unmanageable driver this manifests in the state dependence of the edm gp to some extent we expect that using time lags e g takens 1981 sugihara 1994 will allow us to compensate for other unobserved unmanageable drivers though this is the focus of a subsequent paper finally our results are restricted to settings where the dynamics of the system are expected to remain constant or change slowly through time in cases where known drivers are expected to change we suggest that edm gp forecasts be assessed regularly relevant changes to the dynamics will be detectable as a marked change in forecast accuracy we have found that it is possible to construct accurate approximations of the expected pareto front using edp whose policies are robust to structural uncertainties i e they work even though we do not have an explicit mathematical model for the system their performance is typically quite close to optimal both in terms of harvesting and conservation goals in contrast the single species policies typically did not perform as well since they ignore interactions with other species this leads to rigid policies which can perform badly when applied to the multi species dynamics for example the optimal harvest of prey can be greater when predators are absent while the optimal harvesting of predators requires that prey remain sufficiently abundant without state dependent policies that include both species either one objective or the other will be compromised our results on the 5d system in particular illustrate the need for handling interactions between species to build efficient policies strong interactions lead to high discrepancies in pareto fronts highlighting our interest in using a non parametric forecasting method rather than a potentially incorrect parametric model however if the target species does not have strong interactions with others single species policies may be adequate although the simulation results shown here are generally quite positive there are several caveats to note in the application of edp first the time series used to estimate the gp must be sufficient to allow the dynamics to be reconstructed in cases where the time series are too short or trace out only a small portion of the feasible state space we should expect edp to generate sub optimal policies to avoid this we recommend first evaluating the out of sample performance of the gp or other forecasting algorithm second a good value function approximation method is critical although beyond the scope of our formal investigation we found that the support states may influence td policy computation particularly when the number of dimensions is high when the dimension is low a regular grid of states may be used to generate a near optimal policy everywhere in the state space however as the number of dimensions increases this solution is no longer available it is therefore useful to include some specific states of interest such as estimates of the current population sizes moreover although we used a gp to approximate the value function other interpolation methods could easily be used e g splines radial basis functions etc these will clearly have different advantages and drawbacks that vary with the specific problem regardless of the function approximation method employed poor approximations lead to computational instability hence care is required in choosing an approximation method after trying piece wise constant and polynomial methods we settled on the gp for value function interpolation as it gave the best overall performance third we have focused strictly on identifying an optimal harvest policy recent work has highlighted how such optimal policies may perform poorly under other decision criteria such as long term sustainability or remaining within a safe operating space barfuss et al 2018 however sustainability and safe operating spaces can be recast as optimal control problems with suitably modified rewards doyen and de lara 2010 tipping points can be avoided similarly see wu and lin 1999 borkar and meyn 2002 defourny et al 2008 for examples of these risk sensitive rewards though we have previously found boettiger et al 2015 that tipping points are naturally avoided in edp because the variance of edm predictions goes up in unexplored parts of the state space nevertheless appending additional objectives for sustainability and safe operating spaces to the edp framework is an important next step fourth edp cannot hope to handle strongly nonstationary and or exogenously forced dynamics or problems with incompatible objectives in this case incorporating data on relevant external drivers may improve forecasts but as with parametric approaches to modeling the resulting edp policy will be sensitive to our assumptions about the behavior of drivers in the future very large state spaces with high dimensional attractors are also problematic as it is difficult to reconstruct the dynamics we therefore recommend that any application of edp begin by testing the forecast accuracy of the edm gp although here we have focused on trade offs between harvesting and conservation goals the edp algorithm is quite general and could be applied to other problems in ecosystem management it is therefore worth noting what parts would have to be modified the most obvious is that in other cases the rewards and controls would be different here we have assumed that the controls modify the states in a known way specifically that we remove a known fraction of the population in other settings alternate controls such as outplanting individuals of different species or modifying nutrient input rates may be relevant in more general problems where the response of the system to the controls is not known a priori we would fit the gp to the time series of both states and controls i e x t 1 f x t u t however increasing the input dimension to the gp will require longer time series to achieve similar forecast accuracy ecosystem models are often strongly sensitive to assumptions about species interactions making it difficult to assess the robustness of conservation and management plans that depend on them importantly there is no way of knowing the true dynamics in real world systems and optimal control approaches are not feasible alternative approaches to ecosystem management that produce demonstrably optimal policies despite large structural uncertainties are needed as a first step in this direction edp provides a platform for producing near optimal policies directly from observed system dynamics without specifying an ecosystem model we expect that this will be of use in many areas of ecosystem management credit authorship contribution statement antoine brias

24674,understanding the effects of climate on biodiversity and its different levels of response to climatic variation is important for addressing conservation based questions the use of bioclimatic variables and species modelling tools is common in environmental agricultural and biological sciences unfortunately most of the ecological local studies are limited to the use of global data with coarse spatial resolutions while fine grain climate data are necessary to capture environmental variability and perform reliable modelling we propose a high resolution dataset 40 m grid of the suite of original coarse grain bioclimatic variables proposed by worldclim 2 for the island of sardinia italy variations amongst our dataset and worldclim 2 were calculated and mapped to show the spatial distribution of differences between all pairs of variables we observed relevant differences for the bioclimatic variables related to rainfall mean rmse 39 79 mean nrmse 0 21 compared to the temperature ones mean rmse 4 81 mean nrmse 0 11 moreover discrepancies are not evenly distributed in the territory the greater differences correspond to the areas characterized by complex orographic systems results recommend caution in making ecological assessments based on bioclimatic variables derived from global data with coarse spatial resolutions in physiographically complex landscapes

a specific pattern according to the different bioclimatic variable analysed in these figures red colours indicate areas where a given variable was overestimated by worldclim 2 blue colours the underestimated ones for example the spatial distributions of the differences for the annual mean temperature bio01 highlighted lower values modelled by worldclim 2 compared to our dataset in the mountain areas with differences of more than 2 c fig 5 maximum minimum temperatures bio05 06 10 are generally underestimated by worldclim 2 with peaks up to 7 c for the maximum temperature of the warmest month bio05 accordingly the annual range of extreme temperature conditions bio07 was underestimated by worldclim 2 in the internal and mountain areas of the island being overestimated in coastal areas in the north south and eastern coast fig 5 regarding rainfall related bioclimatic variables a markedly different spatial distribution was observed for the annual precipitation bio12 showing a gradient moving from north west to south east in the nw areas worldclim 2 overestimated while the se areas are underestimated with strong differences higher than 500 mm fig 6 precipitation seasonality coefficient of variation bio15 is strongly overestimated by worldclim 2 in the internal and mountain areas and slightly underestimated along the s e coast the precipitation of driest quarter bio17 is generally overestimated in particular in the nw zones an asymmetry similar to the one observed for bio12 was detected for the mean temperature of wettest quarter bio08 with underestimated values in the western part of the island and overestimated ones in the eastern ones fig 7 furthermore a general overestimation was observed for the precipitation of warmest quarter bio18 in all western areas of the island from north to south up to 40 mm fig 7 5 discussions bioclimatic variables are fundamental for understanding and modelling the ecological processes and the distribution of biodiversity of earth jennings and harris 2017 rivas martínez et al 2011 nevertheless our study demonstrated that comparing the global dataset to a high spatial resolution one revealed that we should pay attention on the accuracy of coarse spatial resolutions data especially in areas of high heterogeneity where weather stations are few and sparsely distributed sandoval et al 2020 like the mediterranean area we observed that the discrepancies existing amongst our high spatial resolution dataset and worldclim 2 are evident and each bioclimatic variable behaved in a different way we did not detect a general over underestimation pattern or trend of the bioclimatic variables but we rather observed variable specific patterns mainly linked to the local orographic conditions and to the direction of the dominant winds driving weather perturbations the new high spatial resolution dataset compared to worldclim 2 showed that the larger discrepancies were spotted in the bioclimatic variables related to precipitation those inconsistencies are not evenly distributed in the territory the greater differences between the two datasets correspond to the areas characterized by complex orographic systems moreover since the dominant air mass perturbations in sardinia come from west and the rain shadow effect is not considered in the model the global dataset probably limited by an uneven distribution of meteorological stations strongly underestimated the annual precipitation in the eastern zones and overestimated the annual and the summer precipitations i e driest and warmest quarter in the western zones up to 40 mm these discrepancies if applied for example to vascular plant species distribution models can cause biases in the comprehension of the distribution of thermo xerophilous species particularly or exclusively abundant in the western coast of the island like chamaerops humilis polygala rupestris viola arborescens amongst the others biondi et al 2001 and contrarily of mesophilous species of non mediterranean origin that can surprisingly colonize low elevation down to the sea level in the eastern coast like ostrya carpinifolia bacchetta et al 2004a and taxus baccata farris et al 2012 similar limitations of the worldclim spatial dataset accuracy especially in isolated mountainous areas were indicated for the first and second versions of this dataset by hijmans et al 2005 and fick and hijmans 2017 respectively in particular for italy pesaresi et al 2014 2017 highlighted that the lower accuracy in precipitation spatialization of worldclim could be explained by the scarcity of meteorological stations density respect to the topographic complexity and heterogeneity of the italian territories bedia et al 2013 highlighted that the discrepancy in precipitation related variables between local and worldclim datasets could determine a lack of robustness of the species distribution models leading for example to artifacts in the projections of climate change scenarios at regional or local scales this can eventually compromise the successful use of models in biodiversity conservation and management actions the maximum minimum temperature of the warmest coldest month are underestimated i e compared to the high spatial resolution dataset the global dataset generally models cooler summer maximum up to 7 c and colder winter minimum more than 4 c accordingly the coarse scale dataset models a smaller temperature annual range in the mountains and a wider one on the coasts underrating the continentality values in the internal areas and exaggerating it on the coasts these discrepancies are particularly important in the mediterranean climate since the seasonal distribution of rainfall and the extreme temperatures determine the limits for species survival since sardinia shows many plains and depressed areas in the internal parts of the island often surrounded by hills or mountains it is of crucial importance to discriminate areas with higher temperature annual range i e more continental from those characterized by a smaller temperature annual range i e more oceanic in the more continental areas no matter the altitude above the sea level species like arbutus unedo l laurus nobilis l and myrtus communis l amongst the others are very rare if not completely absent bacchetta et al 2007 farris et al 2007a whereas species more tolerant to continentality like quercus gr pubescens are relatively abundant even at lower elevation bacchetta et al 2004b the observed differences related to the precipitation of driest warmest periods also influence the delimitation between mediterranean and temperate macro bioclimates rivas martínez et al 2011 the definition of this ecological boundary can be particularly important in a mediterranean island where zones with a temperate bioclimate are crucial for the conservation of small isolated populations of plant species of boreal temperate origin often living at their rear edge and therefore with important conservation concerns such as daphne laureola isopyrum thalictroides lotus alpinus and sanicula europaea farris et al 2018 rosati et al 2020 but also characterized by a high evolutionary potential hampe and petit 2005 in the same way those temperate areas in a mediterranean context host non sclerophyllous plant communities like woods with quercus gr pubescens ostrya carpinifolia taxus baccata and ilex aquifolium as shrubs with sorbus torminalis malus pumila pyrus communis and juniperus nana bacchetta et al 2009 farris et al 2012 and perennial pasturelands with anthoxanthum odoratum and cynosurus cristatus farris et al 2013 identified as habitats of european concern treating the bioclimatic indices individually helps us to understand which are more reliable indicating the critical issues to be faced when one is forced to use global datasets such as worldclim 2 in a mediterranean territory according to our results in sardinia the most consistent indices regard temperature with the annual mean temperature being the most reliable one yet the spatial distribution of the variables highlights that mountain areas are difficult to model in fact even the annual mean temperature shows some variations on the contrary worldclim 2 does not seem to be reliable on the precipitation indices influencing the combined indices too amongst the least performing variables we can identify minimum temperature of coldest month bio06 and the precipitation of warmest quarter bio18 given the high discrepancy identified in several sectors of our study area we recommend being cautious in making ecological assessments based on bioclimatic variables derived from global data with coarse spatial resolutions the high degree of variability of the new high resolution bioclimatic variables of the island underlined the need to use fine spatial resolution data to capture the ecological response in physiographically complex landscapes hijmans et al 2005 6

24674,understanding the effects of climate on biodiversity and its different levels of response to climatic variation is important for addressing conservation based questions the use of bioclimatic variables and species modelling tools is common in environmental agricultural and biological sciences unfortunately most of the ecological local studies are limited to the use of global data with coarse spatial resolutions while fine grain climate data are necessary to capture environmental variability and perform reliable modelling we propose a high resolution dataset 40 m grid of the suite of original coarse grain bioclimatic variables proposed by worldclim 2 for the island of sardinia italy variations amongst our dataset and worldclim 2 were calculated and mapped to show the spatial distribution of differences between all pairs of variables we observed relevant differences for the bioclimatic variables related to rainfall mean rmse 39 79 mean nrmse 0 21 compared to the temperature ones mean rmse 4 81 mean nrmse 0 11 moreover discrepancies are not evenly distributed in the territory the greater differences correspond to the areas characterized by complex orographic systems results recommend caution in making ecological assessments based on bioclimatic variables derived from global data with coarse spatial resolutions in physiographically complex landscapes

fine grain dataset and the original coarse grain bioclimatic variables of worldclim 2 we performed a quantitative comparison and spatial distribution of errors between all pairs of variables of these datasets the high resolution data produced can be particularly suited for studying species distributions under current conditions improving ecological studies at finer spatial scales 2 study area the

orographic systems moreover since the dominant air mass perturbations in sardinia come from west and the rain shadow effect is not considered in the model the global dataset probably limited by an uneven distribution of meteorological stations strongly underestimated the annual precipitation in the eastern zones and overestimated the annual and the summer precipitations i e driest and warmest quarter in the western zones up to 40 mm these discrepancies if applied for example to vascular plant species distribution models can cause biases in the comprehension of the distribution of thermo xerophilous species particularly or exclusively abundant in the western coast of the island like chamaerops humilis polygala rupestris viola arborescens amongst the others biondi et al 2001 and contrarily of mesophilous species of non mediterranean origin that can surprisingly colonize low elevation down to the sea level in the eastern coast like ostrya carpinifolia bacchetta et al 2004a and taxus baccata farris et al 2012 similar limitations of the worldclim spatial dataset accuracy especially in isolated mountainous areas were indicated for the first and second versions of this dataset by hijmans et al 2005 and fick and hijmans 2017 respectively in particular for italy pesaresi et al 2014 2017 highlighted that the lower accuracy in precipitation spatialization of worldclim could be explained by the scarcity of meteorological stations density respect to the topographic complexity and heterogeneity of the italian territories bedia et al 2013 highlighted that the discrepancy in precipitation related variables between local and worldclim datasets could determine a lack of robustness of the species distribution models leading for example to artifacts in the projections of climate change scenarios at regional or local scales this can eventually compromise the successful use of models in biodiversity conservation and management actions the maximum minimum temperature of the warmest coldest month are underestimated i e compared to the high spatial resolution dataset the global dataset generally models cooler summer maximum up to 7 c and colder winter minimum more than 4 c accordingly the coarse scale dataset models a smaller temperature annual range in the mountains and a wider one on the coasts underrating the continentality values in the internal areas and exaggerating it on the coasts these discrepancies are particularly important in the mediterranean climate since the seasonal distribution of rainfall and the extreme temperatures determine the limits for species survival since sardinia shows many plains and depressed areas in the internal parts of the island often surrounded by hills or mountains it is of crucial importance to discriminate areas with higher temperature annual range i e more continental from those characterized by a smaller temperature annual range i e more oceanic in the more continental areas no matter the altitude above the sea level species like arbutus unedo l laurus nobilis l and myrtus communis l amongst the others are very rare if not completely absent bacchetta et al 2007 farris et al 2007a whereas species more tolerant to continentality like quercus gr pubescens are relatively abundant even at lower elevation bacchetta et al 2004b the observed differences related to the precipitation of driest warmest periods also influence the delimitation between mediterranean and temperate macro bioclimates rivas martínez et al 2011 the definition of this ecological boundary can be particularly important in a mediterranean island where zones with a temperate bioclimate are crucial for the conservation of small isolated populations of plant species of boreal temperate origin often living at their rear edge and therefore with important conservation concerns such as daphne laureola isopyrum thalictroides lotus alpinus and sanicula europaea farris et al 2018 rosati et al 2020 but also characterized by a high evolutionary potential hampe and petit 2005 in the same way those temperate areas in a mediterranean context host non sclerophyllous plant communities like woods with quercus gr pubescens ostrya carpinifolia taxus baccata and ilex aquifolium as shrubs with sorbus torminalis malus pumila pyrus communis and juniperus nana bacchetta et al 2009 farris et al 2012 and perennial pasturelands with anthoxanthum odoratum and cynosurus cristatus farris et al 2013 identified as habitats of european concern treating the bioclimatic indices individually helps us to understand which are more reliable indicating the critical issues to be faced when one is forced to use global datasets such as worldclim 2 in a mediterranean territory according to our results in sardinia the most consistent indices regard temperature with the annual mean temperature being the most reliable one yet the spatial distribution of the variables highlights that mountain areas are difficult to model in fact even the annual mean temperature shows some variations on the contrary worldclim 2 does not seem to be reliable on the precipitation indices influencing the combined indices too amongst the least performing variables we can identify minimum temperature of coldest month bio06 and the precipitation of warmest quarter bio18 given the high discrepancy identified in several sectors of our study area we recommend being cautious in making ecological assessments based on bioclimatic variables derived from global data with coarse spatial resolutions the high degree of variability of the new high resolution bioclimatic variables of the island underlined the need to use fine spatial resolution data to capture the ecological response in physiographically complex landscapes hijmans et al 2005 6 conclusions in this paper we present and make available the first high spatial resolution dataset for the second largest island in the mediterranean sardinia italy including the 19 bioclimatic variables proposed in worldclim and widely used for ecological studies e g iannella et al 2019 sýkora et al 2017 increasing the availability of high spatial resolution data to improve ecological understanding of variation at finer scales is extremely important especially in the mediterranean regions where past geographical and climatic changes and current environmental heterogeneities have determined high levels of biodiversity and biogeographical complexity medail 2017 thompson 2020 tree species composition and richness in europe is shaped and strongly influenced by both historical and environmental conditions in particular climate svenning and skov 2005 high levels of divergence have been highlighted particularly on islands which have been attributed to the combined effects of climatic changes current ecological conditions and anthropogenic factors that have originated a long history of population isolation gonzález martínez et al 2010 these new data will support a new generation of research studies in a broad array of ecological applications at a much finer scale than previously possible this sharpening of analysis is particularly urgent in those areas considered as climate change hotspots giorgi 2006 like the mediterranean basin giorgi and lionello 2008 in southern european mountains boreo temperate species are suspected to undergo a serious decline in future decades as a consequence of the climatic change erschbamer et al 2009 normand et al 2007 stanisci et al 2005 coarse scale data is certainly useful for studying patterns on a global scale but to model in order to obtain reliable results for planning conservation actions and biodiversity management we need data with good spatial resolution sandoval et al 2020 showing the variability of our
