sustainable development to find out the responses of actual water consumption eta dry mass dm and yield y of drip fertigated hybrid maize to different water and nitrogen levels three year continuous

addition to s1w1 treatment the yield of ck was higher than the yield under deficit irrigation of the same nitrogen level when the nitrogen application was 150 kg ha the average yield of s1w1 increased by 6 compared with ck when nitrogen application increased from 150 kg ha to 300 kg ha the yield of ck s1w2 and s3w2 decreased in different extent by 18 22 and 17 respectively based on the parabolic relationships between yield and nitrogen rate we modified jensen model by introducing a new water sensitive index which considered the response of crop water sensitivity to the nitrogen application and background mineral in soil comparing the modified jensen model w n jensen model to jensen model and n jensen model which considering the parabolic relationship between the yield and nitrogen

stomatal conductance and influences photosynthesis under sever water deficit tang et al 2017 excessive nitrogen application increases the concentration of soil nitrate raises up osmotic pressure of roots and makes the water potential difference between roots and soil go down which is not conducive to water uptake and thus enhances the negative impact of water deficit on crop yield and water use efficiency kang et al 2011 shrestha et al 2013 it is confirmed by a series of long term field experiments that dry mass grain nitrogen content grain yield of maize were all affected by both nitrogen

affect the redistribution and transfer of assimilation between different organs gao et al 2015 luo et al 2017 sarker et al 2017 the limited grain capacity under over applied nitrogen levels may cause incoordination between source and pool as well as excessive growth of stem and leaf dai et al 2008 tollenaar 1989 which results in an increase of dry mass but an unchanging or even decrease of yield therefore for high fertility soils medium nitrogen application rate 70 140 kg ha can achieve relatively high yields and maintain low soil nitrite residues dai et al 2008 previous researches on crop

stewart and musick 1982 vaux and pruitt 1983 jensen model set up with consecutive multiply and water sensitive index is one of the most widely used because it can describe the effects of water stress at different stages on yield more accurate and intuitive al jamal et al 2000 smilovic et al 2016 shen et al 1995 sun et al 2012 zhou et al 2003 through a large number of simulations of maize yield it was found that maize yield is most sensitive to water deficit at the tasseling stage because water deficit at tasseling stage leads to a decline in pollen vigor which results in an irreversible reduction in the number of corn kernels fuad hassan et al 2008 nesmith and ritchie 1992 samarah and alqudah 2011 tranel et al 2008 vollbrecht et al 2005 wang et al 2018 wang et al 2020 maize yield is relatively tolerant of water deficit at the seeding stage due to the compensatory effects of photosynthetic rate transpiration rate and assimilation redistribution after rehydration ding et al 2006 sharp et al 2004 steman 1982 after a series of study it is found that jensen model is affected by climatic and tillage conditions especially fertilizer in most cases foster and brozović 2018 gallais et al 2007 igbadun et al 2007 jensen model irrespective of fertilization is only applicable in some specific situations in other words the accuracy of jensen model will significantly reduce when the amount of nitrogen application exceeds a certain range making it unsuitable for the widely use in order to fully consider the influence of fertilizer researchers modified water productivity functions by adding fertilizer factors a general way is to multiply a fertilizer function including a multivariate linear function of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium sun et al 2012 a binary quadratic function of nitrogen rate and fertilization frequency shen et al 2001 and a quadratic function of potential maximum yield and nitrogen amount zhou et al 2003 the proposed functions improved simulation accuracy to some extent but didn t consider the interaction of water and nitrogen and in the context of continuous application of chemical fertilizer for many years the effect of residual nitrogen cannot be negligible grassini et al 2013 li et al 2016 furthermore under the changing climate the impact of nitrogen rate on crop water sensitivity will be more significant thus more detailed research is needed on simulating and predicting crop yields to achieve precise agricultural management therefore based on three years of continuous observations this study 1 analyzed the response of water consumption and growth of hybrid maize to different water and nitrogen conditions 2 quantified the influence of different nitrogen levels on crop water sensitivity and 3 established and evaluated a water nitrogen productivity function that considered the effects of nitrogen application rate and background soil mineral on crop water sensitive index to provide a scientific basis for the water and nitrogen management of hybrid maize 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental conditions split plot experiments were conducted from april to september during 2016 2018 in china agricultural university shiyanghe experimental station 102 51 e 37 52 n 1581 m a s l located in hexi corridor northwest china the annual evaporation is 2000 mm and the average ground water depth is 25 m meteorological data including wind speed ws m s solar radiation rs w m2 air temperature t relative humidity rh and precipitation p mm were obtained from a standard weather station hobo onset computer corp usa installed in the experimental station the basic meteorological data during the study period are shown in table 1 the soil texture was sandy loam with dry bulk density of 1 51 g cm3 saturated water content of 0 45 cm3 cm3 and field water holding rate of 0 28 cm3 cm3 the cultivar of hybrid maize and the proportion of male and female were chosen as local standard from 2016 to 2018 planting density is 100 000 plants ha soil was covered with plastic mulch before sowing and every plot included three mulches as shown in fig 1 the area of one plot is 4 8 45 m2 and a protection zone was set up between each plot the plots were randomly organized in 2016 and then fixed to consider the accumulation of nitrogen residual in soil during 2017 and 2018 drip irrigation was applied under the mulch with the irrigation frequency of every ten days and the dripper flow of 2 5 l h three irrigation levels ck w1 w2 as 100 75 and 50 of potential crop transpiration etc were set up at four different growth stages seedling stage s1 jointing stage s2 tasseling stage s3 grain filling stage s4 table 2a etc was determined by the single crop coefficient method doorenbos 1975 where the crop coefficient kc was an average of the values calculated by jiang at the same station from 2012 to 2014 jiang et al 2016 and the reference evapotranspiration et0 was calculated by penman monteith equation from 2016 to 2018 monteith 1965 each treatment has three repetitions irrigation amount i mm was the difference between etc and p during the last irrigation period the irrigation date and amount of ck in 2016 2018 were showed in table 2b and the irrigation depth was 1 m considering that water deficit at the tasseling stage has the greatest impact on the final yield domínguez et al 2012a 2012b farré and faci 2009 waller et al 2003 we chose ck and s3w2 to apply with different nitrogen application rates which were 50 150 200 250 and 300 kg ha in 2016 upper n application rate of 300 kg ha was determined by the local amount from 2017 in order to distinguish the different responses of hybrid maize to water stress at vegetative and reproductive growth stages we added s1w2 to combine with the five and two more nitrogen application rates so finally there are three irrigation treatments ck s1w2 s3w2 combined with seven nitrogen application rates from 0 to 300 kg ha with a gradient of 50 kg ha n1 n2 n3 n4 n5 n6 n7 in 2017 and 2018 40 of the total nitrogen application rate was applied before sowing and 60 of the total was applied with irrigation with a fixed proportion as table 3 phosphorus and potassium were applied k2o 60 kg ha p2o5 165 kg ha before sowing and the amount was also the common doses in the region 2 2 measurements the volumetric soil water content swc mm was measured by the portable soil moisture monitoring system diviner 2000 usa before and after every irrigation and at the end of every growth stages from 0 to 100 cm with a vertical interval of 10 cm measuring points were set in bare soil next to the dripper and in center of mulch separately we used the average value of three measuring points to represent the soil water content of the whole plot soil samples were taken at the same depth using oven drying method to calibrate the diviner data at the end of each growth stages soil samples were also taken before sowing and at the end of every growth stages in bare soil next to the drippers in center of mulch separately from 0 to 100 cm with a vertical interval of 10 cm to measure soil nitrate n no3 kg ha and anomia nh4 kg ha using flow analyzer auto analyzer 3 usa the actual evapotranspiration eta under each treatment was calculated according to the water balance equation due to the deep depth of groundwater large capacity of soil and canopy interception no groundwater recharge deep leakage or runoff were considered so the final formula of eta is 1 e t a p i δ s w where p is precipitation between two irrigation events mm i is irrigation amount mm δsw is the difference of soil water content between two irrigation events mm three female plants of each treatments were selected and then differentiated into stems leaves and ears and dried in oven at 80 until constant weight to obtain the aboveground dry mass dm t ha of different organs at the end of grain filling stage fifteen continuous female plants in a row located on the center mulch without male plants were randomly selected and dried at 70 until constant weight to obtain grain yield the final grain yields were normalized to mass water content of 13 for comparison 2 3 model description 2 3 1 jensen water production function jensen model is one of the most widely used water production function considering different growth stages jensen 1968 as follows 2 y a y m i 1 n e t a i e t m i λ i where n is the number of growth stages i is the order of each growth stage et ai is actual evapotranspiration of growth stage i et mi is the potential evapotranspiration of growth stage i y a is the actual yield related to actual water evapotranspiration y m is potential yield under full irrigation λ i is water sensitive index in growth stage i λ i reflects the influence of water deficit in this stage the larger λ i is the more sensitive plants is to water deficit which means insufficient water supply in this growth stage will lead to a serious reduction of yield and vice versus λ i changes with different cultivar and different growth stages 2 3 2 n jensen model modified jensen water production function considering nitrogen application rate only a common form of existing water and nitrogen production function is jensen model multiplied by an unary quadratic function which describes the effect of nitrogen rate wang et al 1997 zhou et al 2003 as follows 3 y a y m b 0 b 1 n b 2 n

water production function considering coupling effect of water and nitrogen at different growth stages based on the response of crop water sensitivity to nitrogen considering the combined effect of nitrogen application rate and background soil mineral in the water sensitive index the formula was obtained as follow 4 y a y m b n i 1 n e t a i e t m i λ i n where n is the nitrogen application rate

soil mineral use efficiency taken as 20 according to the results of zeng et al 2017 and zhao et al 2006 2 3 4 evaluation of model performance we evaluated the performance of the models using the linear regression between measured and simulated values the coefficient of determination r2 normalized root mean square error nrmse willmott s index d david and legates 1999 panda et al 2004 and akaike information criterion aic akaike 1974 were used the equations are as follows 7 r 2 σ i 1 n m i m s i s σ i 1 n m i m 2 0 5 σ i 1 n s i s 2 0 5 2 8 n r m s e 100 m σ i 1 n m i s i 2 n 0 5 9 d 1

indicate a better dispersion and simplicity of the model 2 4 statistical analysis two factor analysis of variance anova and regression analysis were performed using spss 19 0 ibm spss statistics usa and microsoft excel 2010 3 results and discussion 3 1 actual evapotranspiration eta dry mass dm and grain yield y actual evapotranspiration eta aboveground dry mass dm and grain yield y under different treatments from 2016 to 2018 are shown in table 5 and the responses to irrigation amount and nitrogen application rates are shown in fig 2 with different letters indicating significant differences between treatments at a level of α 0 05 tested by duncan s multiple range test there was no significant difference between eta and yield in 2016 as well as eta in 2018 under different nitrogen rates so we use letter ns for all those bars the irrigation amount had a significant influence on eta and dm for all three years and on the yield in 2017 and 2018 from the error bars in fig 2 we can find the differences among irrigation amount is much bigger than those among nitrogen application rates indicating that water had a greater influence than nitrogen under different irrigation treatments eta shows a nearly parabolic change with the increase of nitrogen application rate shown in fig 2 the basic rule of eta under different nitrogen application rates is full irrigation water deficit at seedling stage water deficit at grain filling stage water deficit at tasseling stage water deficit at jointing stage in 2017 when the nitrogen application rates were 100 150 and 200 kg ha eta of s1w1 in three years was 3 1 5 6 and 8 3 higher than that of ck that is under some proper soil environment with nitrogen more active transpiration may occur for crops under moderate water stress which may lead to an increased eta the response of eta to different nitrogen rates at different growth stages also changed in 2018 under 50 kg ha nitrogen application rate eta of the s1w2 was 9 2 higher than that of s3w2 but with the nitrogen application rate going up to 300 kg ha eta of s1w2 decreased rapidly to 86 4 of s3w2 the results of 2016 didn t show a very specific relationship between yield and nitrogen application rate from 2017 the response of dm and y to the coupling effect of water and nitrogen became significant and in 2018 water nitrogen and water nitrogen coupling all had significant effects on yield one possible cause is that the absorption transport and redistribution of soil nitrogen is a slow process kiani et al 2017 li et al 2016 mekala and nambi 2016 so the effect of nitrogen can only gradually show up after the three year consecutive experiment under all the deficit irrigation treatments the optimal nitrogen application rate that reached the maximum yield in 2016 2018 was between 100 and 200 kg ha to ignore the differences caused by cultivars we normalized all the yield as shown in fig 3 ran et al 2019 it can be seen from the figure that under different irrigation treatments the optimal amount of nitrogen application rate related to the maximum yield was not a fixed value and the decline rate of yield when the nitrogen application rate exceed the optimal value also differed when the nitrogen application rate was greater than the optimal rate the yield declined slowly for ck and s3w2 but decreased rapidly for s1w2 compared with the maximum yield the yield corresponding to the maximum nitrogen application rate reduced by 18 30 and 19 under ck s1w2 and s3w2 separately compared with sufficient irrigation with the increase of nitrogen application rate the yield reduction caused by water deficit was gradually increasing that is high nitrogen rate promotes the crop s sensitivity to water deficit therefore it is believed that there is a threshold for the nitrogen rate to achieve positive effect on grain yield the yield increased with the rising nitrogen application rate when the nitrogen rate didn t reach the threshold since during this period the nitrogen satisfied nutrient demand of the crop but yield would decrease in some extent if nitrogen rate exceeded the threshold because excessive nitrogen would hinder the uptake of water table 6 shows the quadratic relationship between the yield and nitrogen application rate from 2016 to 2018 by analyzing the different forms of the relationship between grain yield and nitrogen application rate manevski believed that piecewise linear function is more suitable than the quadratic formula in describing the trend of yield change with the increasing nitrogen rate manevski et al 2016 compared with the furrow irrigation in the experiments fertilizer use efficiency is higher under drip fertigation matimati et al 2014 wilkinson et al 2007 besides under drip fertigation most of the nitrogen remained in the soil instead of leaching away making the cumulative effect more serious therefore the use of a quadratic form of nitrogen effect function under drip fertigation is not consistent with manevski s conclusion according to the quadratic relationship the optimal nitrogen rate nm corresponding to sufficient irrigation ck seedling stage s1 jointing stage s2 tasseling stage s3 and grain filling stage s4 can be calculated which are 144 77 170 6 103 and 204 kg ha respectively 3 2 parameterization of jensen model n jensen model and w n jensen model since there were more treatments added from 2017 jensen model was calibrated using the data of different water treatments under n4 in 2017 and verified with all the observations in 2016 and 2018 the parameters are shown in table 7 the yield of corn for seed production is most sensitive to water deficit at tasseling stage followed by grain filling stage and jointing stage the negative water sensitive index at the seedling stage indicated that a suitable water deficit at the seedling stage is beneficial to the crop growth as well as to increase final yield the performance of jensen model is shown in table 8 and fig 4 it was found from verification that the nrmse of 2016 and 2018 increased from 0 063 to 0 187 the simulation accuracy r2 was not greater than 0 4 and the consistency index d was 0 68 and 0 53 these indicators showed that the simulation results of jensen model were not ideal under the condition with large differences in nitrogen application rate and high gradient of soil inorganic nitrogen content based on the moisture sensitive index in table 7 the n jensen model was calibrated using the data of 2017 the parameters are shown in table 9 the verification of the n jensen model is shown in table 10 and fig 5 it can be seen from the simulation results that compared with jensen model r2and d of the n jensen model were improved indicating that it can reflect the impact of nitrogen application rate on the yield to a certain extent however r2 for the three years were all less than 0 55 which didn t meet the accuracy requirements for yield simulation under the long term water and nitrogen treatment before the parameterization of w n jensen model in order to quantify the relationship between water sensitive index and nitrogen rate water sensitive index under different nitrogen application rates in the jensen model are shown in table 11 the relationship of λ i n b n with nitrogen application rates is shown in fig 6 λ i n increased linearly with nitrogen rate in each growth stage and b n is a parabolic function of nitrogen rate which is basically consistent with assumption in model description using measured n0 and calculated nm the w n jensen model was calibrated using the data of 2017 shown in table 12 the verification of the w n jensen model is shown in table 13 and fig 7 after considering the accumulation of background value of soil mineral and the effect of nitrogen on water sensitive index r2 was above 0 67 in three years and d was close to 0 9 nrmse was less than 0 1 and the simulation error was relatively stable for the three years the simulation accuracy and stability of the w n jensen model under different water and nitrogen conditions had been greatly improved 3 3 comparison and evaluation of jensen model n jensen model and w n jensen model comparison of the simulation results of jensen n jensen and w n jensen model under the three nitrogen levels of low 0 50 kg ha medium 100 200 kg ha and high 250 300 kg ha was shown in fig 8 the fitting accuracy of the three models under medium nitrogen level are relatively high with r2 equal to 0 6 0 9 and 0 7 respectively indicating that they all have higher accuracy and stability for simulating the response of yield to water deficit under a certain range of nitrogen levels while they performed differently under other nitrogen levels r2 of jensen model under the low and high nitrogen levels is only about 0 1 and the simulated yield is always higher than the measured data the n jensen model significantly improved the r2 of the simulation under the three nitrogen application rates from high and low and can reasonably showed the parabolic trend of yield under different nitrogen applications however in addition to the medium nitrogen level its simulation still has a large overestimation especially for the high nitrogen level with an error of up to 25 the inaccurate yield simulation of the jensen model was attributed to that the yield of crops under nitrogen deficiency and excess is overestimated and the error would increase as nitrogen accumulates the n jensen model also overestimated crop yield under the excessive nitrogen besides neither the initial nitrogen content in the soil nor the extreme sensitivity of crop to water deficit caused by the long term high nitrogen application was indicated in jensen nor n jensen model since soil nitrogen accumulation was not taken into account after considering the effect of high nitrogen on the water sensitivity index the problem of overestimation of output under the high nitrogen level has been greatly improved and the trend of simulated output is more consistent with practice the simulated yield of w n jensen model under low medium and high nitrogen levels stayed within 15 4 of the actual grain yield the performance of three models is shown in table 14 and fig 9 among the three models w n jensen model has the highest r2 d and the smallest nrmse ssr and aic which proved that w n jensen model performed better in simulation accuracy and model simplicity with a relatively simple process of calibration therefore it is suggested that the w n jensen model can be promoted for widely use for its good performance on simulating water and nitrogen productivity 4 conclusion this paper analyzed the effect of water deficit and nitrogen application on the grain yield of hybrid maize based on the results of three year continuous experiments and the main conclusions are 1 the aboveground dry mass and grain yield of hybrid maize went up first and then fell down with the increase of nitrogen application rate and the decreasing extent and rates were determined under different water conditions 2 the water sensitive index in jensen model was affected by both nitrogen application rate and the background value of soil mineral and it increased linearly with the increase of nitrogen application rate 3 the w n jensen model based on the response of water sensitivity to nitrogen application rate and background value of soil mineral had a good performance in simulating yield with a simple process of parameter calibration which is superior to the existing jensen and n jensen models the accuracy of w n jensen model did not decrease with time because the annual variation of soil initial nitrogen content was taken into account therefore w n jensen model a water and fertilizer production function considering the coupling effect of water and nitrogen can be promoted for managing precision agriculture and improving crop productivity declaration of competing interest the authors declare

relationships between yield and nitrogen rate we modified jensen model by introducing a new water sensitive index which considered the response of crop water sensitivity to the nitrogen application and background mineral in soil comparing the modified jensen model w n jensen model to jensen model and n jensen model which considering the parabolic relationship between the yield and nitrogen

reduction in the number of corn kernels fuad hassan et al 2008 nesmith and ritchie 1992 samarah and alqudah 2011 tranel et al 2008 vollbrecht et al 2005 wang et al 2018 wang et al 2020 maize yield is relatively tolerant of water deficit at the seeding stage due to the compensatory effects of photosynthetic rate transpiration rate and assimilation redistribution after rehydration ding et al 2006 sharp et al 2004 steman 1982 after a series of study it is found that jensen model is affected by climatic and tillage conditions especially fertilizer in most cases foster and brozović 2018 gallais et al 2007 igbadun et al 2007 jensen model irrespective of fertilization is only applicable in some specific situations in other words the accuracy of jensen model will significantly reduce when the amount of nitrogen application exceeds a certain range making it unsuitable for the widely use in order to fully consider the influence of fertilizer researchers modified water productivity functions by adding fertilizer factors a general way is to multiply a fertilizer function including a multivariate linear function of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium sun et al 2012 a binary quadratic function of nitrogen rate and fertilization frequency shen et al 2001 and a quadratic function of potential maximum yield and nitrogen amount zhou et al 2003 the proposed functions improved simulation accuracy to some extent but didn t consider the interaction of water and nitrogen and in the context of continuous application of chemical fertilizer for many years the effect of residual nitrogen cannot be negligible grassini et al 2013 li et al 2016 furthermore under the changing climate the impact of nitrogen rate on crop water sensitivity will be more significant thus more detailed research is needed on simulating and predicting crop yields to achieve precise agricultural management therefore based on three years of continuous observations this study 1 analyzed the response of water consumption and growth of hybrid maize to different water and nitrogen conditions 2 quantified the influence of different nitrogen levels on crop water sensitivity and 3 established and evaluated a water nitrogen productivity function that considered the effects of nitrogen application rate and background soil mineral on crop water sensitive index to provide a scientific basis for the water and nitrogen management of hybrid maize 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental conditions split plot experiments were conducted from april to september during 2016 2018 in china agricultural university shiyanghe experimental station 102 51 e 37 52 n 1581 m a s l located in hexi corridor northwest china the annual evaporation is 2000 mm and the average ground water depth is 25 m meteorological data including wind speed ws m s solar radiation rs w m2 air temperature t relative humidity rh and precipitation p mm were obtained from a standard weather station hobo onset computer corp usa installed in the experimental station the basic meteorological data during the study period are shown in table 1 the soil texture was sandy loam with dry bulk density of 1 51 g cm3 saturated water content of 0 45 cm3 cm3 and field water holding rate of 0 28 cm3 cm3 the cultivar of hybrid maize and the proportion of male and female were chosen as local standard from 2016 to 2018 planting density is 100 000 plants ha soil was covered with plastic mulch before sowing and every plot included three mulches as shown in fig 1 the area of one plot is 4 8 45 m2 and a protection zone was set up between each plot the plots were randomly organized in 2016 and then fixed to consider the accumulation of nitrogen residual in soil during 2017 and 2018 drip irrigation was applied under the mulch with the irrigation frequency of every ten days and the dripper flow of 2 5 l h three irrigation levels ck w1 w2 as 100 75 and 50 of potential crop transpiration etc were set up at four different growth stages seedling stage s1 jointing stage s2 tasseling stage s3 grain filling stage s4 table 2a etc was determined by the single crop coefficient method doorenbos 1975 where the crop coefficient kc was an average of the values calculated by jiang at the same station from 2012 to 2014 jiang et al 2016 and the reference evapotranspiration et0 was calculated by penman monteith equation from 2016 to 2018 monteith 1965 each treatment has three repetitions irrigation amount i mm was the difference between etc and p during the last irrigation period the irrigation date and amount of ck in 2016 2018 were showed in table 2b and the irrigation depth was 1 m considering that water deficit at the tasseling stage has the greatest impact on the final yield domínguez et al 2012a 2012b farré and faci 2009 waller et al 2003 we chose ck and s3w2 to apply with different nitrogen application rates which were 50 150 200 250 and 300 kg ha in 2016 upper n application rate of 300 kg ha was determined by the local amount from 2017 in order to distinguish the different responses of hybrid maize to water stress at vegetative and reproductive growth stages we added s1w2 to combine with the five and two more nitrogen application rates so finally there are three irrigation treatments ck s1w2 s3w2 combined with seven nitrogen application rates from 0 to 300 kg ha with a gradient of 50 kg ha n1 n2 n3 n4 n5 n6 n7 in 2017 and 2018 40 of the total nitrogen application rate was applied before sowing and 60 of the total was applied with irrigation with a fixed proportion as table 3 phosphorus and potassium were applied k2o 60 kg ha p2o5 165 kg ha before sowing and the amount was also the common doses in the region 2 2 measurements the volumetric soil water content swc mm was measured by the portable soil moisture monitoring system diviner 2000 usa before and after every irrigation and at the end of every growth stages from 0 to 100 cm with a vertical interval of 10 cm measuring points were set in bare soil next to the dripper and in center of mulch separately we used the average value of three measuring points to represent the soil water content of the whole plot soil samples were taken at the same depth using oven drying method to calibrate the diviner data at the end of each growth stages soil samples were also taken before sowing and at the end of every growth stages in bare soil next to the drippers in center of mulch separately from 0 to 100 cm with a vertical interval of 10 cm to measure soil nitrate n no3 kg ha and anomia nh4 kg ha using flow analyzer auto analyzer 3 usa the actual evapotranspiration eta under each treatment was calculated according to the water balance equation due to the deep depth of groundwater large capacity of soil and canopy interception no groundwater recharge deep leakage or runoff were considered so the final formula of eta is 1 e t a p i δ s w where p is precipitation between two irrigation events mm i is irrigation amount mm δsw is the difference of soil water content between two irrigation events mm three female plants of each treatments were selected and then differentiated into stems leaves and ears and dried in oven at 80 until constant weight to obtain the aboveground dry mass dm t ha of different organs at the end of grain filling stage fifteen continuous female plants in a row located on the center mulch without male plants were randomly selected and dried at 70 until constant weight to obtain grain yield the final grain yields were normalized to mass water content of 13 for comparison 2 3 model description 2 3 1 jensen water production function jensen model is one of the most widely used water production function considering different growth stages jensen 1968 as follows 2 y a y m i 1 n e t a i e t m i λ i where n is the number of growth stages i is the order of each growth stage et ai is actual evapotranspiration of growth stage i et mi is the potential evapotranspiration of growth stage i y a is the actual yield related to actual water evapotranspiration y m is potential yield under full irrigation λ i is water sensitive index in growth stage i λ i reflects the influence of water deficit in this stage the larger λ i is the more sensitive plants is to water deficit which means insufficient water supply in this growth stage will lead to a serious reduction of yield and vice versus λ i changes with different cultivar and different growth stages 2 3 2 n jensen model modified jensen water production function considering nitrogen application rate only a common form of existing water and

linear regression between measured and simulated values the coefficient of determination r2 normalized root mean square error nrmse willmott s index d david and legates 1999 panda et al 2004 and

indicate a better dispersion and simplicity of the model 2 4 statistical analysis two factor analysis of variance anova and regression analysis were performed using spss 19 0 ibm spss statistics usa and microsoft excel 2010 3 results and discussion 3 1 actual evapotranspiration eta dry mass dm and grain yield y actual evapotranspiration eta aboveground dry mass dm and grain yield y under different treatments from 2016 to 2018 are shown in table 5 and the responses to irrigation amount and nitrogen application rates are shown in fig 2 with different letters indicating significant differences between treatments at a level of α 0 05 tested by duncan s multiple range test there was no significant difference between eta and yield in 2016 as well as eta in 2018 under different nitrogen rates so we use letter ns for all those bars the irrigation amount had a significant influence on eta and dm for all three years and on the yield in 2017 and 2018 from the error bars in fig 2 we can find the differences among irrigation amount is much bigger than those among nitrogen application rates indicating that water had a greater influence than nitrogen under different irrigation treatments eta shows a nearly parabolic change with the increase of nitrogen application rate shown in fig 2 the basic rule of eta under different nitrogen application rates is full irrigation water deficit at seedling stage water deficit at grain filling stage water deficit at tasseling stage water deficit at jointing stage in 2017 when the nitrogen application rates were 100 150 and 200 kg ha eta of s1w1 in three years was 3 1 5 6 and 8 3 higher than that of ck that is under some proper soil environment with nitrogen more active transpiration may occur for crops under moderate water stress which may lead to an increased eta the response of eta to different nitrogen rates at different growth stages also changed in 2018 under 50 kg ha nitrogen application rate eta of the s1w2 was 9 2 higher than that of s3w2 but with the nitrogen application rate going up to 300 kg ha eta of s1w2 decreased rapidly to 86 4 of s3w2 the results of 2016 didn t show a very specific relationship between yield and nitrogen application rate from 2017 the response of dm and y to the coupling effect of water and nitrogen became significant and in 2018 water nitrogen and water nitrogen coupling all had significant effects on yield one possible cause is that the absorption transport and redistribution of soil nitrogen is a slow process kiani et al 2017 li et al 2016 mekala and nambi 2016 so the effect of nitrogen can only gradually show up after the three year consecutive experiment under all the deficit irrigation treatments the optimal nitrogen application rate that reached the maximum yield in 2016 2018 was between 100 and 200 kg ha to ignore the differences caused by cultivars we normalized all the yield as shown in fig 3 ran et al 2019 it can be seen from the figure that under different irrigation treatments the optimal amount of nitrogen application rate related to the maximum yield was not a fixed value and the decline rate of yield when the nitrogen application rate exceed the optimal value also differed when the nitrogen application rate was greater than the optimal rate the yield declined slowly for ck and s3w2 but decreased rapidly for s1w2 compared with the maximum yield the yield corresponding to the maximum nitrogen application rate reduced by 18 30 and 19 under ck s1w2 and s3w2 separately compared with sufficient irrigation with the increase of nitrogen application rate the yield reduction caused by water deficit was gradually increasing that is high nitrogen rate promotes the crop s sensitivity to water deficit therefore it is believed that there is a threshold for the nitrogen rate to achieve positive effect on grain yield the yield increased with the rising nitrogen application rate when the nitrogen rate didn t reach the threshold since during this period the nitrogen satisfied nutrient demand of the crop but yield would decrease in some extent if nitrogen rate exceeded the threshold because excessive nitrogen would hinder the uptake of water table 6 shows the quadratic relationship between the yield and nitrogen application rate from 2016 to 2018 by analyzing the different forms of the relationship between grain yield and nitrogen application rate manevski believed that piecewise linear function is more suitable than the quadratic formula in describing the trend of yield change with the increasing nitrogen rate manevski et al 2016 compared with the furrow irrigation in the experiments fertilizer use efficiency is higher under drip fertigation matimati et al 2014 wilkinson et al 2007 besides under drip fertigation most of the nitrogen remained in the soil instead of leaching away making the cumulative effect more serious therefore the use of a quadratic form of nitrogen effect function under drip fertigation is not consistent with manevski s conclusion according to the quadratic relationship the optimal nitrogen rate nm corresponding to sufficient irrigation ck seedling stage s1 jointing stage s2 tasseling stage s3 and grain filling stage s4 can be calculated which are 144 77 170 6 103 and 204 kg ha respectively 3 2 parameterization of jensen model n jensen model and w n jensen model since there were more treatments added from 2017 jensen model was calibrated using the data of different water treatments under n4 in 2017 and verified with all the observations in 2016 and 2018 the parameters are shown in table 7 the yield of corn for seed production is most sensitive to water deficit at tasseling stage followed by grain filling stage and jointing stage the negative water sensitive index at the seedling stage indicated that a suitable water deficit at the seedling stage is beneficial to the crop growth as well as to increase final yield the performance of jensen model is shown in table 8 and fig 4 it was found from verification that the nrmse of 2016 and 2018 increased from 0 063 to 0 187 the simulation accuracy r2 was not greater than 0 4 and the consistency index d was 0 68 and 0 53 these indicators showed that the simulation results of jensen model were not ideal under the condition with large differences in nitrogen application rate and high gradient of soil inorganic nitrogen content based on the moisture sensitive index in table 7 the n jensen model was calibrated using the data of 2017 the parameters are shown in table 9 the verification of the n jensen model is shown in table 10 and fig 5 it can be seen from the simulation results that compared with jensen model r2and d of the n jensen model were improved indicating that it can reflect the impact of nitrogen application rate on the yield to a certain extent however r2 for the three years were all less than 0 55 which didn t meet the accuracy requirements for yield simulation under the long term water and nitrogen treatment before the parameterization of w n jensen model in order to quantify the relationship between water sensitive index and nitrogen rate water sensitive index under different nitrogen application rates in the jensen model are shown in table 11 the relationship of λ i n b n with nitrogen application rates is shown in fig 6 λ i n increased linearly with nitrogen rate in each growth stage and b n is a parabolic function of nitrogen rate which is basically consistent with assumption in model description using measured n0 and calculated nm the w n jensen model was calibrated using the data of 2017 shown in table 12 the verification of the w n jensen model is shown in table 13 and fig 7 after considering the accumulation of background value of soil mineral and the effect of nitrogen on water sensitive index r2 was above 0 67 in three years and d was close to 0 9 nrmse was less than 0 1 and the simulation error was relatively stable for the three years the simulation accuracy and stability of the w n jensen model under different water and nitrogen conditions had been greatly improved 3 3 comparison and evaluation of jensen model n jensen model and w n jensen model comparison of the simulation results of jensen n jensen and w n jensen model under the three nitrogen levels of low 0 50 kg ha medium 100 200 kg ha and high 250 300 kg ha was shown in fig 8 the fitting accuracy of the three models under medium nitrogen level are relatively high with r2 equal to 0 6 0 9 and 0 7 respectively indicating that they all have higher accuracy and stability for simulating the response of yield to water deficit under a certain range of nitrogen levels while they performed differently under other nitrogen levels r2 of jensen model under the low and high nitrogen levels is only about 0 1 and the simulated yield is always higher than the measured data the n jensen model significantly improved the r2 of the simulation under the three nitrogen application rates from high and low and can reasonably showed the parabolic trend of yield under different nitrogen applications however in addition to the medium nitrogen level its simulation still has a large overestimation especially for the high nitrogen level with an error of up to 25 the inaccurate yield simulation of the jensen model was attributed to that the yield of crops under nitrogen deficiency and excess is overestimated and the error would increase as nitrogen accumulates the n jensen model also overestimated crop yield under the excessive nitrogen besides neither the initial nitrogen content in the soil nor the extreme sensitivity of crop to water deficit caused by the long term high nitrogen application was indicated in jensen nor n jensen model since soil nitrogen accumulation was not taken into account after considering the effect of high nitrogen on the water sensitivity index the problem of overestimation of output under the high nitrogen level has been greatly improved and the trend of simulated output is more consistent with practice the simulated yield of w n jensen model under low medium and high nitrogen levels stayed within 15 4 of the actual grain yield the performance of three models is shown in table 14 and fig 9 among the three models w n jensen model has the highest r2 d and the smallest nrmse ssr and aic which proved that w n jensen model performed better in simulation accuracy and model simplicity with a relatively simple process of calibration therefore it is suggested that the w n jensen model can be promoted for widely use for its good performance on simulating water and nitrogen productivity 4 conclusion this paper analyzed the effect of water deficit and nitrogen application on the grain yield of hybrid maize based on the results of three year continuous experiments and the main conclusions are 1 the aboveground dry mass and grain yield of hybrid maize went up first and then fell down with the increase of nitrogen application rate and the decreasing extent and rates were determined under different water conditions 2 the water sensitive index in jensen model was affected by both nitrogen application rate and the background value of soil mineral and it increased linearly with the increase of nitrogen application rate 3 the w n jensen model based on the response of water sensitivity to nitrogen application rate and background value of soil mineral had a good performance in simulating yield with a simple process of parameter calibration which is superior to the existing jensen and n jensen models the accuracy of w n jensen model did not decrease with time because the annual variation of soil initial nitrogen content was taken into account therefore w n jensen model a water and fertilizer production function considering the coupling effect of water and nitrogen can be promoted for managing precision agriculture and improving crop productivity declaration of competing interest the authors declare

10271,distributed drainage ditches and ponds in agricultural landscape can reduce chemicals export from farmlands their distributed features however result in variations in pollutant removal capacities among different segments in this paper we proposed three descriptive indexes to characterize segmental variations of distributed ditches and ponds systems a size index α segmental size vs system size to represent the static feature of the system a flow index β segmental flow rate vs system flow rate and an initial concentration index γ segmental inflow concentration vs initial field drainage concentration to represent the dynamic feature of the system subsequently a segmental efficiency indicator η was derived from these indexes to represent the pollutant removal differences calculated with and without considering segmental variations of distributed ditch systems the proposed indexes were tested with two hypothetic ditch layouts first and then applied to a case study site where 18 segments of ditches and ponds are distributed around paddy fields in southeastern china the two hypothetical layouts include a slender distribution and a square distribution of ditches both have the same number of identical segments and serve the same area the slender layout represents more spread distributions while the square layout represents more concentrated systems calculated indexes showed that the slender layout produced greater segmental variations than the square layout for the case study the calculated size index and the flow index varied greatly due to segmental size differences and the complex flow connections this in turn led to greater variation in the pollutant removal efficiencies η ranging from 0 021 to 0 63 for low removal rate and 0 021 0 42 for high removal rate the results indicate that the proposed indexes can be used to examine the variable nature of the distributed ditch systems and help provide technical guidance for proper management of the distributed buffer systems in agricultural landscapes keywords distributed ditch pond system dynamic index static index pollutant removal system variation 1 introduction distributed ditches and ponds in agricultural landscapes play important roles in protecting surface waters quality they are surrogate of designated water quality improvement facilities such as buffer strips or constructed wetlands shore et al 2015 tournebize et al 2013 moore et al 2010 kay et al 2009 dabney et al 2006 to achieve effective reduction of agricultural pollutants the recommended ratio of water quality buffer area to the farmland area reported in the existing literature ranges from 1 to 7 passy et al 2012 budd et al 2009 moreno mateos et al 2008 verhoeven et al 2006 fink and mitsch 2004 braskerud and haarstad 2003 such wide range of difference in buffer area requirement is largely caused by the variable hydraulic conditions in the examined systems jia et al 2019 in contrast to the constructed water treatment facilities that possess regulated flow regimes distributed ditches and ponds are scattered in farmlands to provide their primary function of field drainage some ditches and ponds are historical remnant due partly to their unfavorable locations for agricultural development passy et al 2012 these unevenly distributed ditches and ponds possess different water quality functions due to their different hydraulic relationships jia et al 2019 passy et al 2012 their flow and pollutant dynamics vary with locations in either individual or collective ditch segments jia et al 2019 flora and kröger 2014 smith et al 2005 2009 soulsby et al 2003 runes et al 2003 such distributed feature makes it difficult to treat the whole system as one lump sum while evaluating their water quality functions alvord and kadlec 1996 potential errors in estimating pollutant removal capacity of ditch systems may complicate the issue of providing a reliable guideline for water quality buffers requirement though environmental benefits of distributed ditches and ponds have been recognized variations in water quality functions at different ditch segments or components have not been examined thoroughly littlejohn et al 2014 lizotte et al 2012 ahiablame et al 2011 kidmose et al 2010 moore et al 2010 rose et al 2008 bennett et al 2005 a few studies used indexes derived from landscape properties to relate land uses to water quality dynamics but their findings were either inconsistent or contradictory uuemaa et al 2005 bu et al 2014 zhu et al 2019 li et al 2019 for instance li et al 2019 found that water quality is positively correlated to landscape diversity while found that relationship negative the same index explained the water quality dynamics from 70 to 90 li et al 2010 to 20 40 li et al 2015 xu and zhang 2016 attributed such inconsistencies to the indexes failing to capture the dynamics feature of water quality changes in agricultural landscape seeking more accurate methods to describe water quality benefit of distributed ditch systems is necessary from both scientific and practical aspects a few studies examined ditch pond segment distributions and their potential relationship with pollutant dynamics using spatial statistical indexes li et al 2019 bu et al 2014 plexida et al 2014 zhou et al 2014 but the indexes were limited to describing static feature of the system such as diversity shannon s index density evenness and connectivity they fell short in capturing dynamic feature of the ditch systems including flow relationships and pollutant removal kinetics in a previous study we demonstrated the variability among ditch segments and the effect of considering such variability on estimating the system pollutant removal jia et al 2019 to further explore approaches for describing practical features of the distributed ditch and pond systems we proposed three descriptive indexes to represent static and dynamic features of ditch systems in this paper our specific objectives are to use these indexes to 1 characterize physical variations of individual ditches and ponds and 2 illustrate the effect of the variations on pollutant removal ability in different ditch segments 2 materials and methods 2 1 indexes to describe individual ditch segment properties 2 1 1 static and dynamic features of ditches and ponds the conventional lump sum approach for evaluating system performance would consider all ditch segments together as one entity and ignore the individual differences in contrast a distributed ditch system may differ in the following aspects 1 individual ditch segments may differ considerably in sizes due either to drainage design considerations or historical reasons 2 flow rates in different segments may vary with their locations and hydraulic conditions and 3 initial concentrations of solutes in different segments may vary due to flow composition i e flow from adjacent crop fields and or upstream segments to better describe above features of distributed ditch and pond systems we propose the following three indexes a size index 1 α i v i v b flow index 2 β i q i q c initial concentration index 3 γ i c 0 i c 0 where v i q i and c 0 i are respectively the volume of water flow rate and initial concentration for the ith ditch segment v and q are total water volume and flow rate of the whole system and c 0 is the initial concentration of solutes in drainage water discharged from crop fields to describe water quality effect of a ditch pond buffer the matching between flow and buffer size can be expressed as 4 λ i α i β i o r λ i v i v q i q numerically the match index λ equals to the ratio of hydraulic retention time of a ditch segment t i to the lumped system t 5 λ i t i t the above indexes can represent both static and dynamic features of a distributed ditch system the static feature as represented by the size index α refers to the condition that the index value is not affected by either location of ditch segment or pollutant removal properties the flow index β and the initial concentration indexes γ represent the dynamic feature of the distributed ditches numerically the flow index β tends to be larger for ditch pond segments located at downstream due to flow convergence the initial concentration index γ is affected not only by flow composition i e drainage flow from either crop field or upstream segments but also by the pollutant removal properties jia et al 2019 the matching index λ also possesses some dynamic feature due to its inclusion of the flow index 2 1 2 evaluating the effect of ditch segment variability on pollutant removal capacity referring to pollutant removing capacity of a ditch system calculated with the lump sum approach the efficiency of pollutant removal through different ditch segments can be calculated with the following equation 6 η i m i m i where η i is pollutant removal efficiency and m i is the pollutant mass removal through a ditch segment i m i is the fair share of the ith segment in pollutant removal according to its size while positioned in the lumped system 7 m i α i m where m is the total mass of pollutant removal using the lumped approach the kinetics of pollutant removal in ditches can be described by the first order reaction equation kadlec and knight 1996 and the total pollutant mass removal for the lumped approach is calculated as 8 m q c 0 1 e k t where k is the pollutant removal constant pollutant removal in a ditch segment can be calculated as 9 m i q i c i 0 1 e k t i o r m i β i q γ i c 0 1 e k λ i t thus the segmental efficiency of a ditch can be further written as 10 η i β i γ i q c 0 1 e λ i k t α q c 0 1 e k t o r η i γ i 1 e λ i k t λ i 1 e k t eq 10 shows how does location of a ditch segment affect its pollutant removal capacity prediction when compared with that calculated using the lump sum approach when η 1 it suggests that the ditch segment contributes the fair share of its pollutant removal according to its size similarly η 1 or η 1 indicates that the segment contribution is either lower or greater than its share η is a function of the matching index and the initial concentration index numerically the efficiency is proportional to the initial condition index the higher value of the matching index λ indicates that the ditch segment possesses longer hydraulic retention time or the flow rate is relatively small 2 2 application of the proposed indexes with two hypothetical systems 2 2 1 two hypothetical ditch systems to demonstrate whether the proposed indexes can be used to evaluate water quality functions of different ditch segments as being affected by their distribution or layout we derived two hypothetical systems with regular layout referring to the work by white and rashleigh 2012 as shown in fig 1 the two systems represent a more spread slender layout and a more concentrated square layout of ditches along fields both layouts receive the same amount of drainage flow and have the same number of ditch segments assume that flow rate from each field plot is 1 and each ditch segment has a uniform size length of 1 the total flow rate amounts 9 and the total number of ditch segment size is 18 2 2 2 the study area and the drainage ditch network the study area is located within the plain river network region in the lower reaches of yangtze river in southeastern china as described in our previous studies chen et al 2020 jia et al 2019 the distributed ditches and ponds system consists of 18 ditch segments in total table 1 including 11 smaller field ditches 5 big delivery ditches and 2 ponds more detailed materials can be found in supplemental materials fig 2 displays observed flow directions in different sections of the ditch system some distinctive features of the system in the study area are 1 the drainage network includes three branches with unequal drainage paths 2 the small field ditches are evenly distributed while the larger delivery ditches and ponds are not three largest segments pd 1 pd 2 and dd 5 in fig 2 are favorably located at the end of three drainage paths 3 flows concentrate from upstream to downstream with some randomness and 4 there are significant differences in sizes of ditches and ponds the delivery ditches are normally 8 10 m wide while the field ditches are 1 m wide flow and concentration dynamics presented in this paper were analyzed according to on site flow measurements jia et al 2019 and the pollutant removal properties reported in existing literature over a wide range of pollutants including pesticides romain et al 2015 nitrate karpuzcu and stringfellow 2012 saeed and sun 2011 and cod and bod5 saeed and sun 2011 table 1 3 results and discussions 3 1 two regular hypothetical layouts 3 1 1 ditch segment variations table 2 lists the calculated values for the size index α flow index β initial concentration index γ matching index λ and segmental efficiency η for the two simplified hypothetical layouts all segments have a uniform size so their size indexes all have the same value of 1 18 or 0 056 nine identical segments in l1 no 1 9 in fig 1 and 10 in l2 no 1 10 both located at the most upstream with the lowest flow rate 0 5 have the largest matching index values the rest segments in l1 have their flow indexes gradually increased from 0 056 to 1 resulting in their matching indexes dropped from 0 5 no 10 to 0 06 no 18 the wide layout l2 showed less variation three identical segments no 11 13 located at the second stage had flow index of 0 167 and matching index of 0 33 this was followed by a third stage that includes three more identical segments no 14 16 with flow index of 0 28 and matching index of 0 20 the last two segments no 17 and 18 have the highest flow indexes and the lowest matching indexes β 0 39 and λ 0 14 for no 17 and β 0 72 and λ 0 077 for no 18 the initial concentration and the ditch segmental efficiency indexes are dynamic as affected by the pollutant removal rates as illustrated in fig 3 for selected removal rates the initial concentration indexes γ for the wide layout l2 was consistently slightly smaller than that for the slander layout l1 and the differences tend to increase with greater removal rates for instance with the lowest removal rate 0 03 d the biggest difference in the initial concentration index is only 0 1 between the two layouts with the highest removal rate 0 5 d the difference increased to 0 13 table 2 and fig 3 the efficiency represents how a ditch segment performs in pollutant removal when compared with the average ideal lumped condition it is affected by flow size and initial concentration eq 10 of the ditch segment for the head water ditch segments their efficiency is 1 indicating that they contribute exactly the same share of pollutant removal as that in a lumped system for downstream ditch segments their efficiencies were low due to the lower initial concentrations and larger flow rates as indicated by eq 10 the efficiency is also affected by the pollutant removal rates lower rates tend to result in higher efficiencies for instance for the lowest removal rate 0 03 d the efficiency of no 10 in l1 is 0 98 and it dropped to 0 95 for the most downstream segment no 18 for the highest removal rate 0 5 d the efficiency was 0 77 for no 10 and 0 48 for no 18 segments the wide layout l2 generally produced higher efficiency than the slander layout indicating that the former is a more efficient distribution especially for pollutants with higher removal rates for instance the arithmetic average efficiency for the lowest removal rate 0 03 d was 0 977 at l1 and 0 982 at l2 while for the highest removal rate 0 5 d the average efficiency was 0 773 at l1 and 0 814 at l2 3 2 the case study ditch pond system 3 2 1 ditch segment variations comparing with the hypothetical layouts with uniform ditch size and regular flow connections situations of real systems are much more complex table 3 lists the calculated values of the size index α flow index β initial concentration index γ and the matching index λ for the ditch system in the study area these index values depend heavily on the type of ditch segments and their positions in the drainage flow network the size index has the largest variation that averaged avg to 0 056 with standard deviation std of 0 082 the average flow index is 0 21 with std of 2 3 the matching index has the smallest variation that averaged to 1 09 and std of 3 33 the initial concentration index γ varied heavily with the pollutant removal rates jia et al 2019 its variation increased with the pollutant removal rate for instance with the lowest pollutant removal rate 0 03 d the initial concentration index averaged at 0 93 with a variance of 0 09 with the highest removal rate 0 2 d the average value dropped to 0 84 while the std increased to 0 22 for 11 upstream ditch segments that receive field drainage only the initial concentration index values are 1 fig 4 presents distributions of all calculated indexes the size index α was very small 0 005 in average for field ditches increased to 0 089 for the four delivery ditches and two ponds and 0 30 for the largest pond pd 1 due to the distributed nature and irregular flow paths of the ditch system fig 2 the flow index displayed some randomness fig 4b its average value was 0 17 for the field ditches that include six segments at the very upstream for the delivery ditches located further downstream the calculated average value of the flow index was 0 38 for the two ponds located at the end of flow paths the calculated flow index was 0 49 showing the converging effect of flow concentration towards downstream the calculated matching indexes fig 4c were generally small except for two conditions the first λ 14 was for the largest segment of branch drain pd 1 that is short and drains a small portion of fields the second λ 2 was for a big delivery ditch at upstream dd 1 in which flow is limited by its position for initial concentration indexes cumulative effect from upstream to downstream grew with the variations fig 4d 3 2 2 variations of pollutant removal at different ditch segments the above analyses showed that functions of individual ditch segments in a distributed system varied greatly and the variations may cause difference in pollutant removal at different ditch segments fig 5 plotted the initial concentration index as function of the matching index for three different ditch segment efficiencies of η i 1 η i 0 5 and η i 1 5 the matching index λ of x axis is in logarithmic scale indicating that the effect of matching index on pollutant removal capacity is large when its value is greater than 1 the matching index has two fold meanings while large values of λ indicate positive effect of longer hydraulic retention time they also indicate negative effect of small inflow rate the first order reduction kinetics indicates that it becomes more costly to remove a pollutant as its concentration decreases these negative effects tend to cancel each other under the conditions of having small matching index λ 1 as shown by the flat to rise curves in fig 5 the negative effect increases with large λ this increased effect of λ on η can be balanced to maintain a stable η only by higher initial concentration for the ditch system in our study area the calculated matching indexes λ was generally less than 1 except under two conditions 1 λ 2 for one upstream delivery ditch and 2 λ 14 for the big pond pd 1 consequently these two segments had high γ values 0 13 and 0 5 but their efficiencies were very low which significantly dragged down the system efficiency one measure to improve the system performance is to lower the matching index of these two segments pd 1 and dd 1 as displayed in fig 4 pd 1 is a big pond and dd 1 is a big delivery ditch both of them are located at corners and receive field drainage from disproportionally small portion of the field rendering them unfavorable hydraulic conditions for pollutant removal similar to the initial concentration index the segmental efficiencies varied little with the low pollutant removal rates but highly with the large removal rates because lower rates correspond to less degradable pollutants in the case study when the pollutant removal rate is low k 0 03 d fig 5a most ditch segments generated efficiency of nearly 1 except at the two segments when the removal rate was assumed to rise to 0 1 d seven segments had efficiency values up to 1 5 fig 5c the results illustrated in fig 5 indicate that the proposed indexes can intuitively express pollutant removal ability of different ditch segments in a distributed system the proposed method can be used to identify locations of the most efficient ditch segments or the least efficient ones this may help protect or improve water quality functions of existing ditches and ponds in agricultural landscape 3 3 implications and limitations in contrast to using static indexes only for ditch systems evaluation in existing studies li et al 2019 zhou et al 2014 bu et al 2014 plexida et al 2014 the descriptive indexes proposed in this study may help better understand behavior of individual segments of distributed ditches and ponds more accurate estimation on water quality functions of distributed buffer systems may help clear the ambiguity in choosing proper area ratio of water quality buffers to crop fields such knowledge may also be used in the future planning or restoration of distributed ditch systems by identifying the high quality or the most effective ditch segments clarke 2015 shore et al 2015 or taking engineering measures to improve the weak segments it should be noted that the above statement was based on the status quo of ditch systems in some conditions the existing layout or distribution of ditches and ponds cannot be altered the variable feature of ditch segments is the inherent character of the system jia et al 2019 whatsoever findings from this research can provide useful information for modifying or managing ditch systems as the agricultural development intensifies passy et al 2012 the indexes proposed here can be seen as secondary or derivative indexes and they can to some extent represent the dynamic nature of the water quality change through the buffer network but the flow and initial concentration indexes can t be derived directly from ditch pond distribution or landscape properties the relationship between the indexes and ditch pond layouts or arrangements and landscape characters needs to be explored in future research 4 conclusions distributed ditches and pond systems possess some inherent variations in dimensions and flow regimes at different level the effect of such feature on their water quality functions cannot be properly evaluated with the conventional lumped system approach the evaluation indexes proposed in this paper described both the dynamic and static features of the distributed ditch and pond systems in pollutant removal at segmental levels calculations of the variable indexes for different ditch segments may help identify existing problems that lowered the system performance the results may be used to derive a general water quality map of a distributed ditch system in order to improve the existing system

10271,distributed drainage ditches and ponds in agricultural landscape can reduce chemicals export from farmlands their distributed features however result in variations in pollutant removal capacities among different segments in this paper we proposed three descriptive indexes to characterize segmental variations of distributed ditches and ponds systems a size index α segmental size vs system size to represent the static feature of the system a flow index β segmental flow rate vs system flow rate and an initial concentration index γ segmental inflow concentration vs initial field drainage concentration to represent the dynamic feature of the system subsequently a segmental efficiency indicator η was derived from these indexes to represent the pollutant removal differences calculated with and without considering segmental variations of distributed ditch systems the proposed indexes were tested with two hypothetic ditch layouts first and then applied to a case study site where 18 segments of ditches and ponds are distributed around paddy fields in southeastern china the two hypothetical layouts include a slender distribution and a square distribution of ditches both have the same number of identical segments and serve the same area the slender layout represents more spread distributions while the square layout represents more concentrated systems calculated indexes showed that the slender layout produced greater segmental variations than the square layout for the case study the calculated size index and the flow index varied greatly due to segmental size differences and the complex flow connections this in turn led to greater variation in the pollutant removal efficiencies η ranging from 0 021 to 0 63 for low removal rate and 0 021 0 42 for high removal rate the results indicate that the proposed indexes can be used to examine the variable nature of the distributed ditch systems and help provide technical guidance for proper management of the distributed buffer systems in agricultural landscapes keywords distributed ditch pond system dynamic index static index pollutant removal system variation 1 introduction distributed ditches and ponds in agricultural landscapes play important roles in protecting surface waters quality they are surrogate of designated water quality improvement facilities such as buffer strips or constructed wetlands shore et al 2015 tournebize et al 2013 moore et al 2010 kay et al 2009 dabney et al 2006 to achieve effective reduction of agricultural pollutants the recommended ratio of water quality buffer area to the farmland area reported in the existing literature ranges from 1 to 7 passy et al 2012 budd et al 2009 moreno mateos et al 2008 verhoeven et al 2006 fink and mitsch 2004 braskerud and haarstad 2003 such wide range of difference in buffer area requirement is largely caused by the variable hydraulic conditions in the examined systems jia et al 2019 in contrast to the constructed water treatment facilities that possess regulated flow regimes distributed ditches and ponds are scattered in farmlands to provide their primary function of field drainage some ditches and ponds are historical remnant due partly to their unfavorable locations for agricultural development passy et al 2012 these unevenly distributed ditches and ponds possess different water quality functions due to their different hydraulic relationships jia et al 2019 passy et al 2012 their flow and pollutant dynamics vary with locations in either individual or collective ditch segments jia et al 2019 flora and kröger 2014 smith et al 2005 2009 soulsby et al 2003 runes et al 2003 such distributed feature makes it difficult to treat the whole system as one lump sum while evaluating their water quality functions alvord and kadlec 1996 potential errors in estimating pollutant removal capacity of ditch systems may complicate the issue of providing a reliable guideline for water quality buffers requirement though environmental benefits of distributed ditches and ponds have been recognized variations in water quality functions at different ditch segments or components have not been examined thoroughly littlejohn et al 2014 lizotte et al 2012 ahiablame et al 2011 kidmose et al 2010 moore et al 2010 rose et al 2008 bennett et al 2005 a few studies used indexes derived from landscape properties to relate land uses to water quality dynamics but their findings were either inconsistent or contradictory uuemaa et al 2005 bu et al 2014 zhu et al 2019 li et al 2019 for instance li et al 2019 found that water quality is positively correlated to landscape diversity while found that relationship negative the same index explained the water quality dynamics from 70 to 90 li et al 2010 to 20 40 li et al 2015 xu and zhang 2016 attributed such inconsistencies to the indexes failing to capture the dynamics feature of water quality changes in agricultural landscape seeking more accurate methods to describe water quality benefit of distributed ditch systems is necessary from both scientific and practical aspects a few studies examined ditch pond segment distributions and their potential relationship with pollutant dynamics using spatial statistical indexes li et al 2019 bu et al 2014 plexida et al 2014 zhou et al 2014 but the indexes were limited to describing static feature of the system such as diversity shannon s index density evenness and connectivity they fell short in capturing dynamic feature of the ditch systems including flow relationships and pollutant removal kinetics in a previous study we demonstrated the variability among ditch segments and the effect of considering such variability on estimating the system pollutant removal jia et al 2019 to further explore approaches for describing practical features of the distributed ditch and pond systems we proposed three descriptive indexes to represent static and dynamic features of ditch systems in this paper our specific objectives are to use these indexes to 1 characterize physical variations of individual ditches and ponds and 2 illustrate the effect of the variations on pollutant removal ability in different ditch segments 2 materials and methods 2 1 indexes to describe individual ditch segment properties 2 1 1 static and dynamic features of ditches and ponds the conventional lump sum approach for evaluating system performance would consider all ditch segments together as one entity and ignore the individual differences in contrast a distributed ditch system may differ in the following aspects 1 individual ditch segments may differ considerably in sizes due either to drainage design considerations or historical reasons 2 flow rates in different segments may vary with their locations and hydraulic conditions and 3 initial concentrations of solutes in different segments may vary due to flow composition i e flow from adjacent crop fields and or upstream segments to better describe above features of distributed ditch and pond systems we propose the following three indexes a size index 1 α i v i v b flow index 2 β i q i q c initial concentration index 3 γ i c 0 i c 0 where v i q i and c 0 i are respectively the volume of water flow rate and initial concentration for the ith ditch segment v and q are total water volume and flow rate of the whole system and c 0 is the initial concentration of solutes in drainage water discharged from crop fields to describe water quality effect of a ditch pond buffer the matching between flow and buffer size can be expressed as 4 λ i α i β i o r λ i v i v q i q numerically the match index λ equals to the ratio of hydraulic retention time of a ditch segment t i to the lumped system t 5 λ i t i t the above indexes can represent both static and dynamic features of a distributed ditch system the static feature as represented by the size index α refers to the condition that the index value is not affected by either location of ditch segment or pollutant removal properties the flow index β and the initial concentration indexes γ represent the dynamic feature of the distributed ditches numerically the flow index β tends to be larger for ditch pond segments located at downstream due to flow convergence the initial concentration index γ is affected not only by flow composition i e drainage flow from either crop field or upstream segments but also by the pollutant removal properties jia et al 2019 the matching index λ also possesses some dynamic feature due to its inclusion of the flow index 2 1 2 evaluating the effect of ditch segment variability on pollutant removal capacity referring to pollutant removing capacity of a ditch system calculated with the lump sum approach the efficiency of pollutant removal through different ditch segments can be calculated with the following equation 6 η i m i m i where η i is pollutant removal efficiency and m i is the pollutant mass removal through a ditch segment i m i is the fair share of the ith segment in pollutant removal according to its size while positioned in the lumped system 7 m i α i m where m is the total mass of pollutant removal using the lumped approach the kinetics of pollutant removal in ditches can be described by the first order reaction equation kadlec and knight 1996 and the total pollutant mass removal for the lumped approach is calculated as 8 m q c 0 1 e k t where k is the pollutant removal constant pollutant removal in a ditch segment can be calculated as 9 m i q i c i 0 1 e k t i o r m i β i q γ i c 0 1 e k λ i t thus the segmental efficiency of a ditch can be further written as 10 η i β i γ i q c 0 1 e λ i k t α q c 0 1 e k t o r η i γ i 1 e λ i k t λ i 1 e k t eq 10 shows how does location of a ditch segment affect its pollutant removal capacity prediction when compared with that calculated using the lump sum approach when η 1 it suggests that the ditch segment contributes the fair share of its pollutant removal according to its size similarly η 1 or η 1 indicates that the segment contribution is either lower or greater than its share η is a function of the matching index and the initial concentration index numerically the efficiency is proportional to the initial condition index the higher value of the matching index λ indicates that the ditch segment possesses longer hydraulic retention time or the flow rate is relatively small 2 2 application of the proposed indexes with two hypothetical systems 2 2 1 two hypothetical ditch systems to demonstrate whether the proposed indexes can be used to evaluate water quality functions of different ditch segments as being affected by their distribution or layout we derived two hypothetical systems with regular layout referring to the work by white and rashleigh 2012 as shown in fig 1 the two systems represent a more spread slender layout and a more concentrated square layout of ditches along fields both layouts receive the same amount of drainage flow and have the same number of ditch segments assume that flow rate from each field plot is 1 and each ditch segment has a uniform size length of 1 the total flow rate amounts 9 and the total number of ditch segment size is 18 2 2 2 the study area and the drainage ditch network the study area is located within the plain river network region in the lower reaches of yangtze river in southeastern china as described in our previous studies chen et al 2020 jia et al 2019 the distributed ditches and ponds system consists of 18 ditch segments in total table 1 including 11 smaller field ditches 5 big delivery ditches and 2 ponds more detailed materials can be found in supplemental materials fig 2 displays observed flow directions in different sections of the ditch system some distinctive features of the system in the study area are 1 the drainage network includes three branches with unequal drainage paths 2 the small field ditches are evenly distributed while the larger delivery ditches and ponds are not three largest segments pd 1 pd 2 and dd 5 in fig 2 are favorably located at the end of three drainage paths 3 flows concentrate from upstream to downstream with some randomness and 4 there are significant differences in sizes of ditches and ponds the delivery ditches are normally 8 10 m wide while the field ditches are 1 m wide flow and concentration dynamics presented in this paper were analyzed according to on site flow measurements jia et al 2019 and the pollutant removal properties reported in existing literature over a wide range of pollutants including pesticides romain et al 2015 nitrate karpuzcu and stringfellow 2012 saeed and sun 2011 and cod and bod5 saeed and sun 2011 table 1 3 results and discussions 3 1 two regular hypothetical layouts 3 1 1 ditch segment variations table 2 lists the calculated values for the size index α flow index β initial concentration index γ matching index λ and segmental efficiency η for the two simplified hypothetical layouts all segments have a uniform size so their size indexes all have the same value of 1 18 or 0 056 nine identical segments in l1 no 1 9 in fig 1 and 10 in l2 no 1 10 both located at the most upstream with the lowest flow rate 0 5 have the largest matching index values the rest segments in l1 have their flow indexes gradually increased from 0 056 to 1 resulting in their matching indexes dropped from 0 5 no 10 to 0 06 no 18 the wide layout l2 showed less variation three identical segments no 11 13 located at the second stage had flow index of 0 167 and matching index of 0 33 this was followed by a third stage that includes three more identical segments no 14 16 with flow index of 0 28 and matching index of 0 20 the last two segments no 17 and 18 have the highest flow indexes and the lowest matching indexes β 0 39 and λ 0 14 for no 17 and β 0 72 and λ 0 077 for no 18 the initial concentration and the ditch segmental efficiency indexes are dynamic as affected by the pollutant removal rates as illustrated in fig 3 for selected removal rates the initial concentration indexes γ for the wide layout l2 was consistently slightly smaller than that for the slander layout l1 and the differences tend to increase with greater removal rates for instance with the lowest removal rate 0 03 d the biggest difference in the initial concentration index is only 0 1 between the two layouts with the highest removal rate 0 5 d the difference increased to 0 13 table 2 and fig 3 the efficiency represents how a ditch segment performs in pollutant removal when compared with the average ideal lumped condition it is affected by flow size and initial concentration eq 10 of the ditch segment for the head water ditch segments their efficiency is 1 indicating that they contribute exactly the same share of pollutant removal as that in a lumped system for downstream ditch segments their efficiencies were low due to the lower initial concentrations and larger flow rates as indicated by eq 10 the efficiency is also affected by the pollutant removal rates lower rates tend to result in higher efficiencies for instance for the lowest removal rate 0 03 d the efficiency of no 10 in l1 is 0 98 and it dropped to 0 95 for the most downstream segment no 18 for the highest removal rate 0 5 d the efficiency was 0 77 for no 10 and 0 48 for no 18 segments the wide layout l2 generally produced higher efficiency than the slander layout indicating that the former is a more efficient distribution especially for pollutants with higher removal rates for instance the arithmetic average efficiency for the lowest removal rate 0 03 d was 0 977 at l1 and 0 982 at l2 while for the highest removal rate 0 5 d the average efficiency was 0 773 at l1 and 0 814 at l2 3 2 the case study ditch pond system 3 2 1 ditch segment variations comparing with the hypothetical layouts with uniform ditch size and regular flow connections situations of real systems are much more complex table 3 lists the calculated values of the size index α flow index β initial concentration index γ and the matching index λ for the ditch system in the study area these index values depend heavily on the type of ditch segments and their positions in the drainage flow network the size index has the largest variation that averaged avg to 0 056 with standard deviation std of 0 082 the average flow index is 0 21 with std of 2 3 the matching index has the smallest variation that averaged to 1 09 and std of 3 33 the initial concentration index γ varied heavily with the pollutant removal rates jia et al 2019 its variation increased with the pollutant removal rate for instance with the lowest pollutant removal rate 0 03 d the initial concentration index averaged at 0 93 with a variance of 0 09 with the highest removal rate 0 2 d the average value dropped to 0 84 while the std increased to 0 22 for 11 upstream ditch segments that receive field drainage only the initial concentration index values are 1 fig 4 presents distributions of all calculated indexes the size index α was very small 0 005 in average for field ditches increased to 0 089 for the four delivery ditches and two ponds and 0 30 for the largest pond pd 1 due to the distributed nature and irregular flow paths of the ditch system fig 2 the flow index displayed some randomness fig 4b its average value was 0 17 for the field ditches that include six segments at the very upstream for the delivery ditches located further downstream the calculated average value of the flow index was 0 38 for the two ponds located at the end of flow paths the calculated flow index was 0 49 showing the converging effect of flow concentration towards downstream the calculated matching indexes fig 4c were generally small except for two conditions the first λ 14 was for the largest segment of branch drain pd 1 that is short and drains a small portion of fields the second λ 2 was for a big delivery ditch at upstream dd 1 in which flow is limited by its position for initial concentration indexes cumulative effect from upstream to downstream grew with the variations fig 4d 3 2 2 variations of pollutant removal at different ditch segments the above analyses showed that functions of individual ditch segments in a distributed system varied greatly and the variations may cause difference in pollutant removal at different ditch segments fig 5 plotted the initial concentration index as function of the matching index for three different ditch segment efficiencies of η i 1 η i 0 5 and η i 1 5 the matching index λ of x axis is in logarithmic scale indicating that the effect of matching index on pollutant removal capacity is large when its value is greater than 1 the matching index has two fold meanings while large values of λ indicate positive effect of longer hydraulic retention time they also indicate negative effect of small inflow rate the first order reduction kinetics indicates that it becomes more costly to remove a pollutant as its concentration decreases these negative effects tend to cancel each other under the conditions of having small matching index λ 1 as shown by the flat to rise curves in fig 5 the negative effect increases with large λ this increased effect of λ on η can be balanced to maintain a stable η only by higher initial concentration for the ditch system in our study area the calculated matching indexes λ was generally less than 1 except under two conditions 1 λ 2 for one upstream delivery ditch and 2 λ 14 for the big pond pd 1 consequently these two segments had high γ values 0 13 and 0 5 but their efficiencies were very low which significantly dragged down the system efficiency one measure to improve the system performance is to lower the matching index of these two segments pd 1 and dd 1 as displayed in fig 4 pd 1 is a big pond and dd 1 is a big delivery ditch both of them are located at corners and receive field drainage from disproportionally small portion of the field rendering them unfavorable hydraulic conditions for pollutant removal similar to the initial concentration index the segmental efficiencies varied little with the low pollutant removal rates but highly with the large removal rates because lower rates correspond to less degradable pollutants in the case study when the pollutant removal rate is low k 0 03 d fig 5a most ditch segments generated efficiency of nearly 1 except at the two segments when the removal rate was assumed to rise to 0 1 d seven segments had efficiency values up to 1 5 fig 5c the results illustrated in fig 5 indicate that the proposed indexes can intuitively express pollutant removal ability of different ditch segments in a distributed system the proposed method can be used to identify locations of the most efficient ditch segments or the least efficient ones this may help protect or improve water quality functions of existing ditches and ponds in agricultural landscape 3 3

required for human health and nutrition and they have an appetizing aroma and flavor monda 2017 rannu et al 2018 its cultivation has recently been encouraged especially in the mediterranean region of turkey as the country is the largest strawberry grower in europe and the fourth worldwide after china the united states us and mexico with it producing 440 968 t of strawberries in 2018 faostat 2020 turkey s mediterranean region has been endowed with abundant water resources however excess and inappropriate irrigation coupled with unsuitable agricultural practices will disrupt the country s strawberry production moreover plants are particularly sensitive to the amount of water applied during floral initiation flowering and fruit formation hedge 1987 as well as limited soil moisture conditions which affect photosynthetic activity and consequently reduce potential growth development and fruit yield farhan and pritts 1997 kırnak et al 2001 rannu et al 2018 despite the widespread use of irrigation for strawberries the crop s water requirements are still undefined lozano et al 2016 a wide range of irrigation water applications that differ in terms of the use of various species of cultivars production methods and climate and water requirement calculations have been put forward by previous studies hancock 1999 lozano et al 2016 in the huelva region of spain the calculated irrigation supply for strawberries varies from 564 to 795 mm per season 1 while the fruit yield varies from 1 027 to 1 084 g per plant 1 lozano et al 2016 in the central coast of california the amount of irrigation water applied to strawberries varies from 300 to 700 mm per season 1 and the fruit yield ranges from 20 to 50 t ha 1 mcniesh et al 1985 irrigation studies conducted on strawberries in bulgaria suggest that 700 800 mm of irrigation water is needed for an optimal yield ivanov 1977 the optimal water application for strawberries has been found to be 485 mm in italy giovanardi testolin 1984 while trials conducted in france and japan demonstrate that 415 and 336 mm of irrigation water should be utilized respectively lemaitre 1976 yuan et al 2004 in another study 300 mm of water was found to be ideal for irrigating strawberries in california us trout gartung 2004 overall all of these studies point out that the appropriate amount of irrigation water requirement depends on the local climate calculation method and cultivar type colored plastic mulches that cover drip irrigation systems are increasingly being used in the raised bed cultivation of strawberries to conserve soil water which increases water use efficiency regulates the soil s temperature restricts evaporation losses reduces weeds and enhances fruit yield and quality mulching is usually practiced in order to keep strawberries clean and to protect them from coming into contact with the soil in order to avoid fruit rot sharma 2002 yuan et al 2004 kumar dey 2012 khadas 2014 kırnak et al 2001 state that mulching could reduce the damaging effects that water stress has on a strawberry plant s development and its fruit yield especially in semi arid regions previous studies conducted on the use of drip irrigation and mulching for fruit crops have identified that improved results concerning yield and water use efficiency can be achieved in different agro climatic zones and soils raina et al 1999 kumar dey 2011 rannu et al 2018 in turkey silver black and transparent polyethylene mulches are generally used in strawberry production however there is no clear evidence on which one of these mulches is the most useful different colors of mulch create specific conditions that have a substantial effect on growth fruit yield and quality as they reflect different wavelengths of light casierra posada et al 2011 the time of growing season and the climate conditions are key factors when it comes to selecting the mulch color which could affect the crops positively or negatively casierra posada et al 2011 furthermore modern consumers are not only interested in a product s taste but also in its compounds since the positive effects of secondary compounds on human health are now realized phytochemical compounds in berries are known to contribute to the prevention of cardiovascular disease cvd cancer and diabetes by regulating different signaling pathways related to cell survival growth and differentiation yang et al 2019 strawberry yield and fruit quality daugaard 2008 and antioxidant activity which is influenced by the total phenolic anthocyanins and ellagic acid contents anttonen et al 2006 can be influenced by the color of the mulch depending on the cultivar nevertheless whether the different types of mulch and their interaction with different irrigation regimes have an effect on taste and health related parameters is still unknown strawberries are well suited to drip irrigation in combination with plastic mulch this has been investigated widely however conflicting results have been observed with respect to their performance and their association with pedoclimate factors cultivation conditions and cultivar types passos 1997 pires et al 2006 according to johnson and fennimore 2005 transparent clear mulch mulched conventional production system parcels produced the highest marketable fruit yield of strawberry compared to black mulch in contrast of all the mulching treatments saeid and mohammed 2015 used in their experimental study transparent black red blue mulch the black cover resulted in the maximum fruit weight however polara and viradiya 2013 obtained a superior yield and better quality properties when using a silver on black mulch compared to a yellow on black mulch and when using a black on white mulch compared to a red on black polyethylene mulch so far studies conducted to analyze the interacted effects of irrigation regimes and different colored plastic mulches on the morphological responses fruit yield land productivity quality and irrigation water use efficiency iwue of strawberries grown in the mediterranean region of turkey are lacking in addition to improve the productivity of strawberry plants either in water deficient or regular excessive irrigation conditions via optimum water management and agricultural practices conducting local trials is essential in this context the present research was undertaken to evaluate the effects of irrigation regimes and various colored plastic mulches on the morphological responses yield quality and iwue of strawberries grown in a spanish type high tunnel system in order to provide an economical way to improve production accordingly this experimental study was conducted in order to determine the appropriate irrigation regime and mulch color for strawberry production in the semi arid agro environmental conditions of turkey and similar areas of cultivation 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and agronomic practices this field experiment was conducted inside a spanish type high tunnel at the çukurova university s experimental farm in adana turkey latitude 36 59 n longitude 35 27 e 20 m above sea level during the 2016 2017 growth season the climate of the experimental site is a typical mediterranean climate with it experiencing cool rainy winters and hot dry summers the soils at the site have been classified as xerofluvents of the entisol order with a clay texture dingil et al 2010 the dry soil bulk density of the top 0 3 m ranged from 1 33 to 1 41 gcm 3 on a dry weight basis and its ph was 7 6 when this study was conducted the soil water content at field capacity and the permanent wilting points were 36 3 g g 1 and 15 7 g g 1 respectively the strawberry cultivar fragaria x annanasa duch cv fortuna is widely used in turkey the short day type of fortuna has a good taste and aroma frigo plants were planted on september 20 2016 which is referred to as zero days after planting dap and cropping continued until june 19 2017 frigo plant materials were used for the experiment and the high tunnel was constructed using a steel frame that was covered by a 0 1 mm thick transparent polyethylene film light diffuser anti bacterial ultraviolet and ethylene vinyl acetate it had a center height of 2 50 m and was 0 8 m high at the open sides 40 m long and 6 5 m wide to monitor temperature and humidity two meteorological stations were used with one positioned 1 5 m above the soil surface in the center of the high tunnel and the other placed 100 m away from the high tunnel the area inside the tunnel was heated solely by solar radiation the weather conditions in the plastic high tunnel varied from month to month from september to january the temperature was lower whereas the temperature was higher from february to june the average growing season daytime temperature was between 2 2 and 5 8 c higher than the outside temperature and at night the average temperature was between 0 5 and 1 9 c higher table 1 furthermore the daytime and nighttime relative humidity were 4 5 and 9 8 higher inside the tunnel than outside the tunnel during the growth period respectively the strawberries were planted in trapezoidal raised beds that measured 0 70 m at the base and 0 50 m at the top and had a height of 0 30 m and the distance between each bed was 0 30 m each bed was covered with polyethylene mulch and a surface drip irrigation system was installed down the center the strawberries were planted in two rows that were 0 3 m apart with the plants being placed 30 cm apart providing an equivalent plant density of 6 65 plants per m 2 there were four beds in each tunnel after planting sufficient water was applied until the plants were well developed fertilizer was applied uniformly to each treatment via drip

utilized to determine the effects of the irrigation regime and mulches on all of the observed parameters over the four periods a least significant difference test was performed to examine the differences between the groups comparisons with a p 0 05 were considered statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 irrigation amount and soil water content the crops were irrigated with equal amounts of water after planting specifically 179 mm until january 23 2017 dap 125 from the initiation of the irrigation treatments to the end of the trial a total of 218 and 109 mm of water were applied to ir100 and ir50 respectively the epan value from september 20 2016 dap 0 to dap 125 was 287 mm this means that 63 of the evaporation from the pan was applied as irrigation before the initiation of the treatments the interval between irrigation was seven days until dap 192 which was three days until the end of the trial moreover irrigation was ceased on dap 275 with drip irrigation black mulch and a kcp of 0 9 treatment 1 0 v kumar and dey 2012 found that strawberries need 402 mm of water similar results were obtained in this study with this experiment finding that 397 mm of water is needed for strawberries the variations of the 30 cm profile of the soil water content throughout the growth season under all of the treatments are shown in fig 1 after dap 125 the irrigation treatments changed the soil water contents fluctuated with the irrigation over the growing season fluctuating between field capacity and wilting point there were significant differences in the total soil water contents between the ir100 and ir50 treatments the highest average soil water content for the 30 cm depth was achieved by the s mulch for both irrigation regimes at an average of 34 3 and 26 3 g g 1 followed by the b t and n mulch throughout the growth season the s mulch s soil water content higher than the b mulch most likely due to the increased temperatures which would accelerate evaporation losses as the color black is highly absorbent when it comes to solar radiation the t mulch also has higher under mulch temperatures than the s mulch due to the formation of condensed water droplets on the former s surface which increases the incoming shortwave radiation and conversely inhibits the outgoing infrared longwave radiation lalitha et al 2010 with the ir100 treatment the s and b mulches soil water content was close to the field capacity throughout the season compared to the n mulch treatment the soil water content of the s b and t mulches was approximately 43 39 and 14 higher with the ir100 treatment respectively in addition with the ir50 treatment the s b and t mulches soil water content was 42 34 and 28 higher respectively zhang et al 2015 found similar results with peanuts grown under various mulch applications with the soil water content within the 20 cm depth being significantly higher for silver and black mulches compared to transparent mulch and no mulch 3 2 land productivity and iwue the results reveal that the color of the mulching material significantly affects the yield parameters of strawberry plants including fruit numbers weight and yield as well as the land productivity and iwue table 2 the land productivity iwue and fruit yield were superior when s mulch was used and when n mulch was used the lowest yield parameters were obtained which aligns with the results obtained by angrej and gaur 2007 parmar et al 2013 and sun et al 2015 when investigating strawberries watermelons and peanuts the increase in yield parameters other than the fruit weight can be attributed to sufficient soil moisture in the root zone and minimal evaporation loss due to the s mulch furthermore the application of the s mulch resulted in better land productivity than that of the b t and n mulch at 8 6 13 7 and 23 1 t ha 1 respectively with this being a significant factor for farmers lozano et al 2016 a higher yield can be attributed to the extended retention of moisture and availability of soil water content because this causes the enhanced uptake of nutrients for an optimum yielding under appropriate soil temperatures as noted by saeid and mohammed 2015 the difference in the yield when using the s and b mulch rather than the t mulch concerns the weed free environment created which was observed in this trial all of the different mulching materials had a significantly higher fruit yield than the n mulch with these being 331 9 208 and 135 g per plant 1 for the s b and t mulches respectively of all the mulching applications the use of the s mulch achieved the maximum number of fruits thus it had the highest yield these results are in line with sharma and agrawal 2004 and aruna et al 2007 studies on tomatoes and angrej and gaur 2007 and parmar et al s 2013 studies on strawberries furthermore concerning the iwue outcomes the use of the s mulch resulted in 2 4 3 9 and 7 1 kg higher yields with 1 m3 of irrigation water compared to those obtained with the b t and n mulches respectively regarding the yield parameters the s mulch may be preferable to the b mulch due to the lower soil temperature it produces lamont 1993 in this context the color of the mulch affects the microclimate around the root zone by modifying the surface s radiation budget filipović et al 2016 kader et al 2017 with more favorable conditions being created by s mulch than b mulch for strawberries grown in high tunnels in a mediterranean climate as determined by this study and by kırnak et al 2001 yuan et al 2004 taparauskiene and miseckaite 2014 and kapur et al 2018a all of the strawberry yield parameters decreased with a reduction in the amount of irrigation a higher amount of water use was responsible for significantly higher about 49 land productivity with the ir100 treatment compared to the ir50 irrigation treatment in this respect sir100 had the highest land productivity at almost 72 t ha 1 followed by bir100 which had 59 4 t ha 1 whereas the lowest strawberry land production was obtained via the nir50 treatment at 22 6 t ha 1 even though it was not statistically significant ir100 s iwue was higher 8 than ir50 s iwue and this correlates with lozano et al s 2016 study on growing strawberries in the mediterranean climate of huelva spain sir100 resulted in the maximum iwue 18 1 kg m 3 which is also in line with the lozano et al s 2016 results 18 3 kg m 3 in addition the relationships between the mulches and the irrigation were all significant concerning all of the yield parameters except for the number of fruits mulch application with the ir100 treatment increased the fruit yield by 40 16 and 1 for the s b and t mulches respectively compared to the n mulch with these increases being 115 93 and 87 respectively with the ir50 treatment thus it s clear that mulching is more effective under water stress conditions and has a vital role to play in water saving as kader et al 2019 state the t mulch had a lesser effect on the yield parameters compared to the n mulch with the ir100 treatment despite the higher soil water content this is due to the density of the weeds under the t mulch being greater than the n mulch which was observed in the field transparent mulch as sarkar et al 2018 mention allows weeds to develop and spread thus it requires additional weed management in ashrafuzzaman et al 2011 study the weed population per m2 was found to be higher under transparent mulch than black blue and no mulch depending on the direct penetration of solar radiation according to edgar et al 2017 weeds decrease crop productivity by interfering with crop growth and they are responsible for yield diminution as they compete for space water and nutrients abbasi et al 2013 the results of the current study are that sir100 obtained remarkably higher strawberry yields followed by bir100 while the lowest yield was obtained by nir50 similarly parmar et al 2013 found that the economically highest net return is obtained by using silver on black mulch rather than yellow red black or white mulches consequentially the use of silver on black mulch is recommended 3 3 lai and the growth of strawberries the lai and growth parameters such as the cn cd and dm of the fortuna strawberry plants were significantly affected by the irrigation level and choice of mulch table 3 in environments where soil water availability is limited plant growth is usually decreased kumar et al 2012 in the current study water stress caused a decrease of 0 2 in the cn 2 6 mm in the cd 0 2 in the lai and 5 6 g in the dm one of the reasons why the yield was greater with the ir100 treatment and s mulch was the increased dm this outcome highlights the larger effect the total dm has on fruit yield which has also been reported by mochizuki et al 2013 who concluded that the assimilation products stored in the vegetative organs and transferred to the fruits increase the yield furthermore this increased production of dm could be attributed to the high lai which is responsible for an increase in the amount of solar radiation penetrating the plant canopy moreover the relationships between the mulch per irrigation and the mulch per irrigation per dap were statistically significant when it comes to the dm the cd dm and lai were significantly higher when s mulch was used than when the other mulches and n mulch were used the dm values for the other mulches were higher than the s mulch at approximately 5 9 and 20 for the b t and n mulches respectively the cd of the s mulch was higher than that of the b t and n mulches which were 2 4 3 and 5 2 mm respectively furthermore the s mulch s dm was significantly higher than the b t and n mulches at 2 1 3 4 and 6 5 g respectively consequently it can be associated with better soil hydrothermal regimes optimum moisture conservation and the suppression of weeds compared to the other mulches gupta and acharya 1993 kumar et al 2012 the s mulch resulted in the highest lai with the lower lais of the b t and n mulches being 0 62 0 82 and 1 01 respectively regarding this torres quezada et al 2015 mention that wider cds with higher cns per plant are responsible for higher yields this implies that crowns are important reservoirs for carbohydrates with 75 of the required amounts being provided from crowns carbohydrate reserves darnell and martin 1988 macias rodriguez et al 2002 furthermore these growth parameters show that the vegetative development of strawberries continues up until about dap 250 sir100 had the highest lai and growth parameters and nir50 had the lowest when comparing sir100 and nir50 s lai and growth parameters at dap 250 the fruit yield per plant increased by approximately 98 g for each 0 1 lai 530 g for each cn 80 g for each 1 mm cd and 32 g for each 1 g dm 3 4 fruit quality the individual acid contents of the fruits are shown in table 4 these acids were significantly influenced by the agricultural practices including the irrigation level and choice of mulch as were their relationships p 0 05 the s mulch generated fruits with significantly higher amounts of oxalic 3 34 g kg 1 succinic 3 38 g kg 1 and ascorbic acid 1 62 g kg 1 whereas the other acids namely citric malic and fumaric were significantly higher when the t mulch was used similarly the different irrigation levels resulted in different accumulations of these acids while ir100 resulted in significantly higher amounts of oxalic citric and fumaric acid deficient irrigation ir50 caused the amount of succinic malic and ascorbic acid in the fruits to be significantly higher this study s data shows that regardless of the treatment citric acid 2 1 20 5 g kg 1 was the dominant organic acid which is in line with the results of kelebek and selli s 2011 research this is followed by the amount of malic acid except when using n mulch with ir100 which resulted in the fruit containing a higher amount of oxalic acid although hwang et al 2019 have reported similar trends concerning the amount of malic and oxalic acid they found a significant variation in the amount of citric acid with it ranging from 4 4 to 7 7 g kg 1 depending on the cultivar and the fruit s ripening stage in the current study the different agricultural practices caused the amount of citric acid and the other acids to vary many other studies on the effect that irrigation regimes have on the total or individual acid quantities of different cultivars and genotypes have been conducted giné bordonaba and terry 2010 giné bordonaba and terry 2016 weber et al 2017 adak et al 2018 kapur et al 2018b these studies indicate that the various genotype reactions developed over different irrigation levels according to the amount of acids in this respect this study s outcomes show that the amount of acid in a strawberry and even in the same cultivar is greatly influenced by the cultivation practices that are implemented including the irrigation regime and the choice of mulch in addition to the impact on fruit taste ascorbic acid also contributes to antioxidant activity up to 10 kalt et al 1999 although the highest amount of ascorbic acid was observed when using s mulch b mulch is mainly chosen by farmers for strawberry cultivation as it provides fruit with the lowest amount of ascorbic acid in a mediterranean climate despite lower ascorbic acid quantities being obtained by using b mulch n and t mulches cannot be recommended due to their inability to control weeds in general the combination of deficit irrigation and the s mulch seems to result in the highest amount of ascorbic acid in the fruit of the fortuna cultivar this study s results show that the fruit s taste is acid dependent kapur et al 2018a 2018b and can be enhanced by changing agricultural practices such as irrigation and mulching as depicted in table 4 this demonstration of the combined effects of irrigation and different types of mulch on the individual acid quantities of strawberries is a significant and novel contribution that has not been previously addressed fruit polyphenols have attracted the interest of modern consumers in the last decade due to the high amount of antioxidants they contain many epidemiologic studies have proven that polyphenols contribute to the prevention of cvd cancer and diabetes by regulating different signaling pathways related to cell survival growth and differentiation yang et al 2019 although the individual impacts of irrigation and mulch on the amount of polyphenols in strawberries have been investigated separately the effect that the relationship between the irrigation regime and the type of mulch has on the amount of polyphenols has not been previously studied this investigation of the relationship between these two factors has revealed an 18 fold increase the polyphenols in strawberries with the highest catechin gallic caffeic and ferulic acid contents being found when transparent mulch was used however unfortunately this mulch isn t recommended as it caused uncontrollable weeds significantly higher amounts of most of the other acids including ellagic acid p coumaric acid and syringic acid were found in the fruit when the s mulch was used compared to the other mulches thus it is a good alternative to the black plastic mulch that is widely used in the mediterranean region of turkey that will improve the fruit s health related compounds although plant polyphenols are beneficial for human health they are also plant stress indicators thus they should be studied multi dimensionally adak et al 2018 report that deficit irrigation causes an increase in the total amount of phenols as their study found that contrary to what was expected it does not increase the amount of catechin chlorogenic and ferulic acid in contrast to the ellagic caffeic and p coumaric acids this can be explained by the different tendencies of these compounds when experiencing water stress regardless of the treatment adak et al 2018 observed that of the selected polyphenols catechin was mostly found in the largest quantities previous researchers balasooriya et al 2019 nowicka et al 2019 indicate that catechin is influenced by the growing conditions including the temperature and the co2 concentrations as well as the cultivar type and the harvest year in the current study the amount of catechin in the fruit was between 0 97 and 11 9 mg 100 g 1 depending on the type of mulch and the irrigation level furthermore the results of this study are in line with aaby et al 2005 results which range from 6 2 to 9 0 mg 100 g 1 conversely balasooriya et al 2019 found lesser amounts of catechin ranging from 0 8 to 0 9 mg 100 g 1 under normal growing conditions according to nowicka et al 2019 these differences are due to the huge variation in the amount of catechin they found specifically from 0 to 19 06 mg 100 g 1 depending on the cultivar and the harvest year the second most abundant polyphenol in this study was ellagic acid with it ranging from 2 25 to 9 98 mg 100 g 1 this correlates with the amount of ellagic acid found by hwang et al 2019 in their study which ranged from 0 87 to 4 0 mg 100 g 1 depending on the cultivar and the harvest year according to kalt et al 1999 the antiviral and antioxidant activity of ellagic acid has a protective effect against colon lung and esophageal cancers kalt et al 1999 in addition bushman et al 2004 and hannum 2004 state that high amounts of ellagic acid in the strawberry fruit could potentially protect humans against inflammation oxidation and bacterial infections according to the obtained outcomes as expected deficit irrigation and silver mulch significantly increase the amount of ellagic acid in fortuna fruits 9 98 mg 100 g 1 neither irrigation nor the mulch type had a significant effect on the amount of gallic acid in the fruit but their relationship did have a significant impact even though the highest quantities of gallic acid were found using the t mulch with the ir100 treatment 8 89 mg 100 g 1 replicating this is not recommended for the previously mentioned reason therefore the use of the s mulch and deficit irrigation seems to be the best option for providing a relatively high amount of gallic acid in the fruit 5 95 mg 100 g 1 moreover the interaction of irrigation and mulch provided the highest amounts of p coumaric 4 12 mg 100 g 1 syringic 0 72 mg 100 g 1 and caffeic acid 0 46 mg 100 g 1 in the strawberries table 5 4 conclusions this study indicates that the amount of irrigation water and the choice of mulch have a significant effect on the attainment of higher yields of strawberries grown in a high tunnel in the mediterranean region of turkey ir100 provided a significantly higher yield than the deficit irrigation ir50 the s mulch provided a significantly higher yield than the b t and n mulch treatments ir100 s land productivity was higher than ir50 s moreover the land productivity of the s mulch was higher than that of the b t and n mulches the iwue was higher with the ir100 treatment although it was not statistically significant however the s mulch was found to be superior to the other mulches of all the treatments sir100 had the highest land productivity and iwue which is essential for the optimum production of strawberries in the mediterranean region of turkey the results of this study show that the lai and growth parameters of fortuna strawberry plants are significantly influenced by irrigation level and choice of mulch the cd dm and lai were significantly higher when s mulch was used compared to the other mulches and n mulch in this context higher growth parameters resulted in a higher strawberry yield additionally this experiment shows the effect that cultivation practices such as irrigation level and the color of the mulch used have on the taste and health related compounds of strawberries in this respect the n and t mulches can be disregarded due to their lack of weed control in spite of the widespread use of black mulch in the mediterranean region of turkey for the most part silver mulch displayed a better performance in terms of the accumulation of the selected polyphenols in the fortuna cultivar the highest amounts of ellagic p coumaric and syringic acids and the relatively highest amounts of ascorbic gallic and caffeic acids were found in the fruits of the plants where the s mulch and the ir50 treatment were employed according to these results strawberries polyphenol quantities can be increased by means of water saving practices however this study needs to be supported by research on the different types of genotypes in terms of their important quality parameters including their earliness and yield along with their fruits individual polyphenol quantity this study shows that when cultivating strawberries in a high tunnel the use of a full irrigation level and silver on black polyethylene mulch will increase the fruit yield and the vegetative growth as it alters the hydrothermal regime of the strawberry plant s root zone in a beneficial way therefore this would be a good regime for farmers cultivating

season in the eastern mediterranean region of turkey using a split plot design with four replicates the treatments comprised full irrigation ir100 and deficit irrigation ir50 in combination with three mulches namely silver on black s black b and transparent t and no mulch n a higher soil moisture content was found under the s mulch followed by b t and n throughout the entire crop growth period for both irrigation regimes the greatest land productivity was obtained from the sir100 71 9 t ha 1 application followed by bir100 59 4 t ha 1 tir100 52 1 t ha 1 and nir100 51 5 t ha 1 the iwue lai and growth parameters reflected the same trend as the land productivity which could be attributed to the soil water content of the mulches under the ir50 irrigation regime all of the parameters were significantly decreased except for the iwue furthermore in spite of the extensive use of b mulch in turkey s mediterranean region the performance of s mulch was mostly superior in terms of the accumulation of the selected polyphenols in the fortuna cultivar the highest ellagic p coumaric and syringic acids and relatively higher ascorbic gallic and caffeic acids were obtained in the plants

required for human health and nutrition and they have an appetizing aroma and flavor monda 2017 rannu et al 2018 its cultivation has recently been encouraged especially in the mediterranean region of turkey as the country is the largest strawberry grower in europe and the fourth worldwide after china the united states us and mexico with it producing 440 968 t of strawberries in 2018 faostat 2020 turkey s mediterranean region has been endowed with abundant water resources however excess and inappropriate irrigation coupled with unsuitable agricultural practices will disrupt the country s strawberry production moreover plants are particularly sensitive to the amount of water applied during floral initiation flowering and fruit formation hedge 1987 as well as limited soil moisture conditions which affect photosynthetic activity and consequently reduce potential growth development and fruit yield farhan and pritts 1997 kırnak et al 2001 rannu et al 2018 despite the widespread use of irrigation for strawberries the crop s water requirements are still undefined lozano et al 2016 a wide range of irrigation water applications that differ in terms of the use of various species of cultivars production methods and climate and water requirement calculations have been put forward by previous studies hancock 1999 lozano et al 2016 in the huelva region of spain the calculated irrigation supply for strawberries varies from 564 to 795 mm per season 1 while the fruit yield varies from 1 027 to 1 084 g per plant 1 lozano et al 2016 in the central coast of california the amount of irrigation water applied to strawberries varies from 300 to 700 mm per season 1 and the fruit yield ranges from 20 to 50 t ha 1 mcniesh et al 1985 irrigation studies conducted on strawberries in bulgaria suggest that 700 800 mm of irrigation water is needed for an optimal yield ivanov 1977 the optimal water application for strawberries has been found to be 485 mm in italy giovanardi testolin 1984 while trials conducted in france and japan demonstrate that 415 and 336 mm of irrigation water should be utilized respectively lemaitre 1976 yuan et al 2004 in another study 300 mm of water was found to be ideal for irrigating strawberries in california us trout gartung 2004 overall all of these studies point out that the appropriate amount of irrigation water requirement depends on the local climate calculation method and cultivar type colored plastic mulches that cover drip irrigation systems are increasingly being used in the raised bed cultivation of strawberries to conserve soil water which increases water use efficiency regulates the soil s temperature restricts evaporation losses reduces weeds and enhances fruit yield and quality mulching is usually practiced in order to keep strawberries clean and to protect them from coming into contact with the soil in order to avoid fruit rot sharma 2002 yuan et al 2004 kumar dey 2012 khadas 2014 kırnak et al 2001 state that mulching could reduce the damaging effects that water stress has on a strawberry plant s development and its fruit yield especially in semi arid regions previous studies conducted on the use of drip irrigation and mulching for fruit crops have identified that improved results concerning yield and water use efficiency can be achieved in different agro climatic zones and soils raina et al 1999 kumar dey 2011 rannu et al 2018 in turkey silver black and transparent polyethylene mulches are generally used in strawberry production however there is no clear evidence on which one of these mulches is the most useful different colors of mulch create specific conditions that have a substantial effect on growth fruit yield and quality as they reflect different wavelengths of light casierra posada et al 2011 the time of growing season and the climate conditions are key factors when it comes to selecting the mulch color which could affect the crops positively or negatively casierra posada et al 2011 furthermore modern consumers are not only interested in a product s taste but also in its compounds since the positive effects of secondary compounds on human health are now realized phytochemical compounds in berries are known to contribute to the prevention of cardiovascular disease cvd cancer and diabetes by regulating different signaling pathways related to cell survival growth and differentiation yang et al 2019 strawberry yield and fruit quality daugaard 2008 and antioxidant activity which is influenced by the total phenolic anthocyanins and ellagic acid contents anttonen et al 2006 can be influenced by the color of the mulch depending on the cultivar nevertheless whether the different types of mulch and their interaction with different irrigation regimes have an effect on taste and health related parameters is still unknown strawberries are well suited to drip irrigation in combination with plastic mulch this has been investigated widely however conflicting results have been observed with respect to their performance and their association with pedoclimate factors cultivation conditions and cultivar types passos 1997 pires et al 2006 according to johnson and fennimore 2005 transparent clear mulch mulched conventional production system parcels produced the highest marketable fruit yield of strawberry compared to black mulch in contrast of all the mulching treatments saeid and mohammed 2015 used in their experimental study transparent black red blue mulch the black cover resulted in the maximum fruit weight however polara and viradiya 2013 obtained a superior yield and better quality properties when using a silver on black mulch compared to a yellow on black mulch and when using a black on white mulch compared to a red on black polyethylene mulch so far studies conducted to analyze the interacted effects of irrigation regimes and different colored plastic mulches on the morphological responses fruit yield land productivity quality and irrigation water use efficiency iwue of strawberries grown in the mediterranean region of turkey are lacking in addition to improve the productivity of strawberry plants either in water deficient or regular excessive irrigation conditions via optimum water management and agricultural practices conducting local trials is essential in this context the present research was undertaken to evaluate the effects of irrigation regimes and various colored plastic mulches on the morphological responses yield quality and iwue of strawberries grown in a spanish type high tunnel system in order to provide an economical way to improve production accordingly this experimental study was conducted in order to determine the appropriate irrigation regime and mulch color for strawberry production

at field capacity and the permanent wilting points were 36 3 g g 1 and 15 7 g g 1 respectively the strawberry cultivar fragaria x annanasa duch cv fortuna is widely used in turkey the short day type of fortuna has a good taste and aroma frigo plants were planted on september 20 2016 which is referred to as zero days after planting dap and cropping continued until june 19 2017 frigo plant materials were used for the experiment and the high tunnel was constructed using a steel frame that was covered by a 0 1 mm thick transparent polyethylene film light diffuser anti bacterial ultraviolet and ethylene vinyl acetate it had a center height of 2 50 m and was 0 8 m high at the open sides 40 m long and 6 5 m wide to monitor temperature and humidity two meteorological stations were used with one positioned 1 5 m above the soil surface in the center of the high tunnel and the other placed 100 m away from the high tunnel the area inside the tunnel was heated solely by solar radiation the weather conditions in the plastic high tunnel varied from month to month from september to january the temperature was lower whereas the temperature was higher from february to june the average growing season daytime temperature was between 2 2 and 5 8 c higher than the outside temperature and at night the average temperature was between 0 5 and 1 9 c higher table 1 furthermore the daytime and nighttime relative humidity were 4 5 and 9 8 higher inside the tunnel than outside the tunnel during the growth period respectively the strawberries were planted in trapezoidal raised beds that measured 0 70 m at the base and 0 50 m at the top and had a height of 0 30 m and the distance between each bed was 0 30 m each bed was covered with polyethylene mulch and a surface drip irrigation system was installed down the center the strawberries were planted in two rows that were 0 3 m apart with the plants being placed 30 cm apart providing an equivalent plant density of 6 65 plants per m 2 there were four beds in each tunnel after planting sufficient water was applied until the plants were well developed fertilizer was applied uniformly to each treatment via drip

utilized to determine the effects of the irrigation regime and mulches on all of the observed parameters over the four periods a least significant difference test was performed to examine the differences between the groups comparisons with a p 0 05 were considered statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 irrigation amount and soil water content the crops were irrigated with equal amounts of water after planting specifically 179 mm until january 23 2017 dap 125 from the initiation of the irrigation treatments to the end of the trial a total of 218 and 109 mm of water were applied to ir100 and ir50 respectively the epan value from september 20 2016 dap 0 to dap 125 was 287 mm this means that 63 of the evaporation from the pan was applied as irrigation before the initiation of the treatments the interval between irrigation was seven days until dap 192 which was three days until the end of the trial moreover irrigation was ceased on dap 275 with drip irrigation black mulch and a kcp of 0 9 treatment 1 0 v kumar and dey 2012 found that strawberries need 402 mm of water similar results were obtained in this study with this experiment finding that 397 mm of water is needed for strawberries the variations of the 30 cm profile of the soil water content throughout the growth season under all of the treatments are shown in fig 1 after dap 125 the irrigation treatments changed the soil water contents fluctuated with the irrigation over the growing season fluctuating between field capacity and wilting point there were significant differences in the total soil water contents between the ir100 and ir50 treatments the highest average soil water content for the 30 cm depth was achieved by the s mulch for both irrigation regimes at an average of 34 3 and 26 3 g g 1 followed by the b t and n mulch throughout the growth season the s mulch s soil water content higher than the b mulch most likely due to the increased temperatures which would accelerate evaporation losses as the color black is highly absorbent when it comes to solar radiation the t mulch also has higher under mulch temperatures than the s mulch due to the formation of condensed water droplets on the former s surface which increases the incoming shortwave radiation and conversely inhibits the outgoing infrared longwave radiation lalitha et al 2010 with the ir100 treatment the s and b mulches soil water content was close to the field capacity throughout the season compared to the n mulch treatment the soil water content of the s b and t mulches was approximately 43 39 and 14 higher with the ir100 treatment respectively in addition with the ir50 treatment the s b and t mulches soil water content was 42 34 and 28 higher respectively zhang et al 2015 found similar results with peanuts grown under various mulch applications with the soil water content within the 20 cm depth being significantly higher for silver and black mulches compared to transparent mulch and no mulch 3 2 land productivity and iwue the results reveal that the color of the mulching material significantly affects the yield parameters of strawberry plants including fruit numbers weight and yield as well as the land productivity and iwue table 2 the land productivity iwue and fruit yield were superior when s mulch was used and when n mulch was used the lowest yield parameters were obtained which aligns with the results obtained by angrej and gaur 2007 parmar et al 2013 and sun et al 2015 when investigating strawberries watermelons and peanuts the increase in yield parameters other than the fruit weight can be attributed to sufficient soil moisture in the root zone and minimal evaporation loss due to the s mulch furthermore the application of the s mulch resulted in better land productivity than that of the b t and n mulch at 8 6 13 7 and 23 1 t ha 1 respectively with this being a significant factor for farmers lozano et al 2016 a higher yield can be attributed to the extended retention of moisture and availability of soil water content because this causes the enhanced uptake of nutrients for an optimum yielding under appropriate soil temperatures as noted by saeid and mohammed 2015 the difference in the yield when using the s and b mulch rather than the t mulch concerns the weed free environment created which was observed in this trial all of the different mulching materials had a significantly higher fruit yield than the n mulch with these being 331 9 208 and 135 g per plant 1 for the s b and t mulches respectively of all the mulching applications the use of the s mulch achieved the maximum number of fruits thus it had the highest yield these results are in line with sharma and agrawal 2004 and aruna et al 2007 studies on tomatoes and angrej and gaur 2007 and parmar et al s 2013 studies on strawberries furthermore concerning the iwue outcomes the use of the s mulch resulted in 2 4 3 9 and 7 1 kg higher yields with 1 m3 of irrigation water compared to those obtained with the b t and n mulches respectively regarding the yield parameters the s mulch may be preferable to the b mulch due to the lower soil temperature it produces lamont 1993 in this context the color of the mulch affects the microclimate around the root zone by modifying the surface s radiation budget filipović et al 2016 kader et al 2017 with more favorable conditions being created by s mulch than b mulch for strawberries grown in high tunnels in a mediterranean climate as determined by this study and by kırnak et al 2001 yuan et al 2004 taparauskiene and miseckaite 2014 and kapur et al 2018a all of the strawberry yield parameters decreased with a reduction in the amount of irrigation a higher amount of water use was responsible for significantly higher about 49 land productivity with the ir100 treatment compared to the ir50 irrigation treatment in this respect sir100 had the highest land productivity at almost 72 t ha 1 followed by bir100 which had 59 4 t ha 1 whereas the lowest strawberry land production was obtained via the nir50 treatment at 22 6 t ha 1 even though it was not statistically significant ir100 s iwue was higher 8 than ir50 s iwue and this correlates with lozano et al s 2016 study on growing strawberries in the mediterranean climate of huelva spain sir100 resulted in the maximum iwue 18 1 kg m 3 which is also in line with the lozano et al s 2016 results 18 3 kg m 3 in addition the relationships between the mulches and the irrigation were all significant concerning all of the yield parameters except for the number of fruits mulch application with the ir100 treatment increased the fruit yield by 40 16 and 1 for the s b and t mulches respectively compared to the n mulch with these increases being 115 93 and 87 respectively with the ir50 treatment thus it s clear that mulching is more effective under water stress conditions and has a vital role to play in water saving as kader et al 2019 state the t mulch had a lesser effect on the yield parameters compared to the n mulch with the ir100 treatment despite the higher soil water content this is due to the density of the weeds under the t mulch being greater than the n mulch which was observed in the field transparent mulch as sarkar et al 2018 mention allows weeds to develop and spread thus it requires additional weed management in ashrafuzzaman et al 2011 study the weed population per m2 was found to be higher under transparent mulch than black blue and no mulch depending on the direct penetration of solar radiation according to edgar et al 2017 weeds decrease crop productivity by interfering with crop growth and they are responsible for yield diminution as they compete for space water and nutrients abbasi et al 2013 the results of the current study are that sir100 obtained remarkably higher strawberry yields followed by bir100 while the lowest yield was obtained by nir50 similarly parmar et al 2013 found that the economically highest net return is obtained by using silver on black mulch rather than yellow red black or white mulches consequentially the use of silver on black mulch is recommended 3 3 lai and the growth of strawberries the lai and growth parameters such as the cn cd and dm of the fortuna strawberry plants were significantly affected by the irrigation level and choice of mulch table 3 in environments where soil water availability is limited plant growth is usually decreased kumar et al 2012 in the current study water stress caused a decrease of 0 2 in the cn 2 6 mm in the cd 0 2 in the lai and 5 6 g in the dm one of the reasons why the yield was greater with the ir100 treatment and s mulch was the increased dm this outcome highlights the larger effect the total dm has on fruit yield which has also been reported by mochizuki et al 2013 who concluded that the assimilation products stored in the vegetative organs and transferred to the fruits increase the yield furthermore this increased production of dm could be attributed to the high lai which is responsible for an increase in the amount of solar radiation penetrating the plant canopy moreover the relationships between the mulch per irrigation and the mulch per irrigation per dap were statistically significant when it comes to the dm the cd dm and lai were significantly higher when s mulch was used than when the other mulches and n mulch were used the dm values for the other mulches were higher than the s mulch at approximately 5 9 and 20 for the b t and n mulches respectively the cd of the s mulch was higher than that of the b t and n mulches which were 2 4 3 and 5 2 mm respectively furthermore the s mulch s dm was significantly higher than the b t and n mulches at 2 1 3 4 and 6 5 g respectively consequently it can be associated with better soil hydrothermal regimes optimum moisture conservation and the suppression of weeds compared to the other mulches gupta and acharya 1993 kumar et al 2012 the s mulch resulted in the highest lai with the lower lais of the b t and n mulches being 0 62 0 82 and 1 01 respectively regarding this torres quezada et al 2015 mention that wider cds with higher cns per plant are responsible for higher yields this implies that crowns are important reservoirs for carbohydrates with 75 of the required amounts being provided from crowns carbohydrate reserves darnell and martin 1988 macias rodriguez et al 2002 furthermore these growth parameters show that the vegetative development of strawberries continues up until about dap 250 sir100 had the highest lai and growth parameters and nir50 had the lowest when comparing sir100 and nir50 s lai and growth parameters at dap 250 the fruit yield per plant increased by approximately 98 g for each 0 1 lai 530 g for each cn 80 g for each 1 mm cd and 32 g for each 1 g dm 3 4 fruit quality the individual acid contents of the fruits are shown in table 4 these acids were significantly influenced by the agricultural practices including the irrigation level and choice of mulch as were their relationships p 0 05 the s mulch generated fruits with significantly higher amounts of oxalic 3 34 g kg 1 succinic 3 38 g kg 1 and ascorbic acid 1 62 g kg 1 whereas the other acids namely citric malic and fumaric were significantly higher when the t mulch was used similarly the different irrigation levels resulted in different accumulations of these acids while ir100 resulted in significantly higher amounts of oxalic citric and fumaric acid deficient irrigation ir50 caused the amount of succinic malic and ascorbic acid in the fruits to be significantly higher this study s data shows that regardless of the treatment citric acid 2 1 20 5 g kg 1 was the dominant organic acid which is in line with the results of kelebek and selli s 2011 research this is followed by the amount of malic acid except when using n mulch with ir100 which resulted in the fruit containing a higher amount of oxalic acid although hwang et al 2019 have reported similar trends concerning the amount of malic and oxalic acid they found a significant variation in the amount of citric acid with it ranging from 4 4 to 7 7 g kg 1 depending on the cultivar and the fruit s ripening stage in the current study the different agricultural practices caused the amount of citric acid and the other acids to vary many other studies on the effect that irrigation regimes have on the total or individual acid quantities of different cultivars and genotypes have been conducted giné bordonaba and terry 2010 giné bordonaba and terry 2016 weber et al 2017 adak et al 2018 kapur et al 2018b these studies indicate that the various genotype reactions developed over different irrigation levels according to the amount of acids in this respect this study s outcomes show that the amount of acid in a strawberry and even in the same cultivar is greatly influenced by the cultivation practices that are implemented including the irrigation regime and the choice of mulch in addition to the impact on fruit taste ascorbic acid also contributes to antioxidant activity up to 10 kalt et al 1999 although the highest amount of ascorbic acid was observed when using s mulch b mulch is mainly chosen by farmers for strawberry cultivation as it provides fruit with the lowest amount of ascorbic acid in a mediterranean climate despite lower ascorbic acid quantities being obtained by using b mulch n and t mulches cannot be recommended due to their inability to control weeds in general the combination of deficit irrigation and the s mulch seems to result in the highest amount of ascorbic acid in the fruit of the fortuna cultivar this study s results show that the fruit s taste is acid dependent kapur et al 2018a 2018b and can be enhanced by changing agricultural practices such as irrigation and mulching as depicted in table 4 this demonstration of the combined effects of irrigation and different types of mulch on the individual acid quantities of strawberries is a significant and novel contribution that has not been previously addressed fruit polyphenols have attracted the interest of modern consumers in the last decade due to the high amount of antioxidants they contain many epidemiologic studies have proven that polyphenols contribute to the prevention of cvd cancer and diabetes by regulating different signaling pathways related to cell survival growth and differentiation yang et al 2019 although the individual impacts of irrigation and mulch on the amount of polyphenols in strawberries have been investigated separately the effect that the relationship between the irrigation regime and the type of mulch has on the amount of polyphenols has not been previously studied this investigation of the relationship between these two factors has revealed an 18 fold increase the polyphenols in strawberries with the highest catechin gallic caffeic and ferulic acid contents being found when transparent mulch was used however unfortunately this mulch isn t recommended as it caused uncontrollable weeds significantly higher amounts of most of the other acids including ellagic acid p coumaric acid and syringic acid were found in the fruit when the s mulch was used compared to the other mulches thus it is a good alternative to the black plastic mulch that is widely used in the mediterranean region of turkey that will improve the fruit s health related compounds although plant polyphenols are beneficial for human health they are also plant stress indicators thus they should be studied multi dimensionally adak et al 2018 report that deficit irrigation causes an increase in the total amount of phenols as their study found that contrary to what was expected it does not increase the amount of catechin chlorogenic and ferulic acid in contrast to the ellagic caffeic and p coumaric acids this can be explained by the different tendencies of these compounds when experiencing water stress regardless of the treatment adak et al 2018 observed that of the selected polyphenols catechin was mostly found in the largest quantities previous researchers balasooriya et al 2019 nowicka et al 2019 indicate that catechin is influenced by the growing conditions including the temperature and the co2 concentrations as well as the cultivar type and the harvest year in the current study the amount of catechin in the fruit was between 0 97 and 11 9 mg 100 g 1 depending on the type of mulch and the irrigation level furthermore the results of this study are in line with aaby et al 2005 results which range from 6 2 to 9 0 mg 100 g 1 conversely balasooriya et al 2019 found lesser amounts of catechin ranging from 0 8 to 0 9 mg 100 g 1 under normal growing conditions according to nowicka et al 2019 these differences are due to the huge variation in the amount of catechin they found specifically from 0 to 19 06 mg 100 g 1 depending on the cultivar and the harvest year the second most abundant polyphenol in this study was ellagic acid with it ranging from 2 25 to 9 98 mg 100 g 1 this correlates with the amount of ellagic acid found by hwang et al 2019 in their study which ranged from 0 87 to 4 0 mg 100 g 1 depending on the cultivar and the harvest year according to kalt et al 1999 the antiviral and antioxidant activity of ellagic acid has a protective effect against colon lung and esophageal cancers kalt et al 1999 in addition bushman et al 2004 and hannum 2004 state that high amounts of ellagic acid in the strawberry fruit could potentially protect humans against inflammation oxidation and bacterial infections according to the obtained outcomes as expected deficit irrigation and silver mulch significantly increase the amount of ellagic acid in fortuna fruits 9 98 mg 100 g 1 neither irrigation nor the mulch type had a significant effect on the amount of gallic acid in the fruit but their relationship did have a significant impact even though the highest quantities of gallic acid were found using the t mulch with the ir100 treatment 8 89 mg 100 g 1 replicating this is not recommended for the previously mentioned reason therefore the use of the s mulch and deficit irrigation seems to be the best option for providing a relatively high amount of gallic acid in the fruit 5 95 mg 100 g 1 moreover the interaction of irrigation and mulch provided the highest amounts of p coumaric 4 12 mg 100 g 1 syringic 0 72 mg 100 g 1 and caffeic acid 0 46 mg 100 g 1 in the strawberries table 5 4 conclusions this study indicates that the amount of irrigation water and the choice of mulch have a significant effect on the attainment of higher yields of strawberries grown in a high tunnel in the mediterranean region of turkey ir100 provided a significantly higher yield than the deficit irrigation ir50 the s mulch provided a significantly higher yield than the b t and n mulch treatments ir100 s land productivity was higher than ir50 s moreover the land productivity of the s mulch was higher than that of the b t and n mulches the iwue was higher with the ir100 treatment although it was not statistically significant however the s mulch was found to be superior to the other mulches of all the treatments sir100 had the highest land productivity and iwue which is essential for the optimum production of strawberries in the mediterranean region of turkey the results of this study show that the lai and growth parameters of fortuna strawberry plants are significantly influenced by irrigation level and choice of mulch the cd dm and lai were significantly higher when s mulch was used compared to the other mulches and n mulch in this context higher growth parameters resulted in a higher strawberry yield additionally this experiment shows the effect that cultivation practices such as irrigation level and the color of the mulch used have on the taste and health related compounds of strawberries in this respect the n and t mulches can be disregarded due to their lack of weed control in spite of the widespread use of black mulch in the mediterranean region of turkey for the most part silver mulch displayed a better performance in terms of the accumulation of the selected polyphenols in the fortuna cultivar the highest amounts of ellagic p coumaric and syringic acids and the relatively highest amounts of ascorbic gallic and caffeic acids were found in the fruits of the plants where the s mulch and the ir50 treatment were employed according to these results strawberries polyphenol quantities can be increased by means of water saving practices however this study needs to be supported by research on the different types of genotypes in terms of their important quality parameters including their earliness and yield along with their fruits individual polyphenol quantity this study shows that when cultivating strawberries in a high tunnel the use of a full irrigation level and silver on black polyethylene mulch will increase the fruit yield and the vegetative growth as it alters the hydrothermal regime of the strawberry plant s root zone in a beneficial way therefore this would be a good regime for farmers cultivating strawberries in a high tunnel in a mediterranean climate to implement declaration of competing interest the authors have declared no conflict of interest acknowledgements s kapur ph d aberdeen

10273,oil palm plantations are rapidly expanding in the brazilian eastern amazon further expansion of irrigated oil palm plantations may occur because they may improve productivity during drought events compared to rainfed only plantations to investigate the importance of irrigation to alleviate drought induced stress on palm trees and its potential as a management alternative we monitored transpiration t mm day 1 in a five year old oil palm plantation during an extreme drought caused by the el niño southern oscillation enso event in the amazon basin our study spanned over the dry season ds and the wet season ws using an ongoing irrigation experiment control with no irrigation drip and sprinkler irrigation to identify how differences in water supply affect the oil palm t during a period of reduced precipitation induced by enso our results indicate that independently of the irrigation system t was higher in the ds compared to the ws higher soil moisture in both the irrigation treatments relative to the control plot allowed for 23 higher average t relative to the control plot the vapor pressure deficit vpd variation presented a higher effect over oil palm transpiration than photosynthetic active radiation in both irrigation systems a higher rate of transpiration with increases in vpd was observed than in the control plot during enso drought additionally within individual palm fronds we also observed differences in vpd tolerance higher for lower and older leaves and avoidance higher for upper and newer leaves results indicate that irrigation increased fruit production by 35 and 26 in the sprinkler and drip irrigation systems respectively overall these results demonstrate the potential role of irrigation to alleviate water stress and maintain productivity of palm oil plantations during periods of moisture stress while highlighting the possible feedback of increasing transpiration on water balance and hydrologic regulation keywords sap flow hysteresis drought oil palm irrigation enso el niño 1 introduction sustainability of palm oil plantations relies directly on their capacity to maintain productivity under changing environmental conditions the response of palm plantations to climate change in the near future is of great interest in the 21st century zainal et al 2012 paterson and lima 2018 sarkar et al 2020 the shift from forests to perennial crop plantations can alter the hydrological cycles thereby changing ecosystem function reducing crop production and damaging socioeconomic related systems asbjornsen et al 2015 manoli et al 2018 in tropical countries such as in southeast asia manoli et al 2018 the brazilian amazon villela et al 2014 southeast of mexico pischke et al 2018 and parts of tropical west africa carr 2011 land is rapidly being converted to oil palm tree plantations elaeis guineensis jacq additionally low productivity during the dry season often leads to compensatory management strategies such as expansion of the planted area to maintain total yields considering the sharply contrasting water relations and water use patterns between palm and forest trees röll et al 2019 hardanto et al 2017 it is important to understand how this conversion will impact the hydrology of these ecosystems in addition severe droughts during el niño southern oscillation events frequently occur across the eastern amazon a region dedicated to growing palm oil in brazil brum et al 2018 however the degree to which the frequency magnitude and spatial extent of such climate anomalies are impacting cropland productivity in these regions is still unknown e g heino et al 2018 palm trees are adapted to warm and humid tropical environments and therefore have high leaf area and high water use niu et al 2015 röll et al 2015 meijide et al 2017 at the plant level there are no visible signs of leaf wilting during periods of moisture stress due the high fibrous tissue thick hypodermis and well developed cuticle characteristic of palm tree leaves rees 1961 carr 2011 nonetheless studies have observed that palm trees can be negatively affected by reductions in soil moisture and increasing vapor pressure deficit vpd kpa which are commonly observed during drought events carr 2011 initially stomatal closure reduces transpiration and lowers carbon uptake and expected yield meijide et al 2017 additionally changes in the sexual ratio of palm inflorescences which is another morphological response to drought can result in reductions in yield while pre mature abortion of fruits and flowers disrupts the long term productivity of palm oil plantations carr 2011 management strategies to mitigate low productivity as a result of drought or limiting soil moisture include selection of palm hybrids resistant to water stress cochard et al 2005 modifications to the industrial processing of drupes palm oil fruit or artificial increments of soil water availability by means of irrigation palat et al 2008 carr 2011 however environmental conditions that result in limiting soil moisture deficits tend to occur over relatively short periods of time compared to the growing season hence the use of easily deployed equipment such as drip irrigation can be beneficial the specific physiological responses of palm oil to hydrologic stress and the capacity to increase yield via different irrigation regimes are not well understood moreover potential tradeoffs between irrigation enhanced productivity and reduced water yield due to increased plant water use are typically not considered irrigation studies in thailand palat et al 2008 and in colombia culman et al 2019 have shown that irrigation contributed to yield by increasing the production of fresh fruit bunches by 50 and 27 respectively nonetheless while productivity increases under irrigation the differences in total daily water use by palm trees are often unknown in plant species that are adapted to constant environmental stress i e changes in soil water availability and high temperature fluctuations the peak of the diel transpiration is often shifted and a greater transpiration is observed in the afternoon when the vpd is low carr 2011 meijide et al 2017 this shift in the lag response or hysteresis between environmental factors such as vpd and par provides a unique opportunity to understand how irrigation might mitigate the effects of drought sap flow sensors are commonly used to provide continuous high resolution measurements of diel water use dynamics in palm oil niu et al 2015 röll et al 2015 and to analyze diel patterns of transpiration in relation to vpd and photosynthetically active radiation par such studies have allowed for a better understanding of the magnitude of the hysteresis between tree transpiration and various environmental factors additionally understanding how irrigation affects the transpiration and productivity of palm oil plantations can lead to more efficient management of water resources to enhance palm oil production thereby improving the sustainability of these production systems culman et al 2019 in this study we aimed to improve our understanding of how drought affects transpiration rates in palm oil plantations and the role of irrigation in alleviating hydrological stress we took advantage of the ongoing irrigation experiments at agropalma a palm oil production company in brazil to understand how artificially increasing available soil water contributes to reducing hydrologic stress and maintaining productivity under extreme drought conditions we monitored palm sap flow during one of the most extreme enso induced droughts ever recorded across the amazon basin jiménez muñoz et al 2016 and in our study site brum et al 2018 we used contrasting irrigation systems in an ongoing experiment i e control with no irrigation drip irrigation and sprinkler irrigation to assess the effectiveness of two irrigation systems in alleviating drought induced water stress while several studies have addressed the effects of irrigation in palm plantations see carr 2011 palat et al 2008 safitri et al 2019 to our knowledge no other study has addressed the potential effects of irrigation of palm oil plantations as a management alternative to severe drought in the brazilian eastern amazon specifically we addressed the following questions and hypotheses 1 what is the relative reduction in transpiration and associated productivity in palm plantations during the wet and dry seasons during a severe enso event drought h1 our first hypothesis is that the enso induced drought on palm t will be significantly alleviated by irrigation due to the higher soil water availability we expect higher t rates during the dry season in irrigated systems compared to the control 2 does irrigation increase palm oil plant tolerance to high vpd or par during an enso year and reduce whole plant level hydrological stress how do drip vs sprinkler irrigation systems differ in their effectiveness h2 we hypothesize that vpd will have a significantly stronger effect on regulating palm t compared to par palm trees are adapted to grow in open fields under high solar radiation conditions however high vpd resulting from drought is an abnormal situation in humid tropical climates that is known to induce water loss regulation additionally we expect that drip irrigation system will be more efficient at increasing vpd tolerance specifically because it increases soil water availability while leaving the leaf boundary unaffected 3 how is the lag or hysteresis pattern of diel transpiration affected by irrigation and is the irrigation induced hysteresis different from the pattern observed in a non irrigated plantation h3 we expect larger hysteresis areas between vpd and par and plant transpiration in unirrigated plantations compared to irrigated ones given that the lag or hysteresis between transpiration and vpd or par increases as a result of increasing resistance to water flow we expect larger hysteresis areas in the dry season and in non irrigated plantations regardless of the season the results from this study will have implications for managing water use and productivity of palm oil plantations grown in environments where irrigation might be needed as part of their management 2 materials and methods this study was conducted from october 2015 middle of the dry season ds to april 2016 middle of the rainy season ws in a five year old palm oil plantation belonging to agropalma company in tailândia pa brazil 2 31 s 48 47 w at 40 m altitude a s l 2 1 enso drought characterization we conducted our study during the most extreme drought on record in this part of the amazon basin jiménez muñoz et al 2016 with a palmer drought severity index below 3 throughout much of the eastern amazon temperatures during the 2015 2016 enso reached a record of 1 5 and 2 c higher than the maximum temperature observed during enso events in 1997 october and 1983 january respectively jiménez muñoz et al 2016 based on data from our meteorological station the precipitation from october 2015 to april 2016 was 1698 mm the ds period from october 2015 to mid january 2015 was under the influence of enso and received 442 mm of rainfall compared to the long term average from 1983 to 2017 for this period of 651 mm which represents a reduction of 32 data from brum et al 2018 the maximum temperature measured was 38 39 c and the period with the strongest water deficits occurred from november 10 to december 1 2015 during these 21 days there was no precipitation and vpd reached 4 5 kpa around midday daily average 2 1 kpa 2 2 irrigation experimental design we used an ongoing irrigation experiment located on agropalma company lands to continuously monitor water use in palm plantations with contrasting irrigation systems during the enso drought the palm trees were planted in 2010 and were grown under different water availability regimes a control treatment with no irrigation a treatment area with a drip irrigation system and a treatment area with a sprinkler irrigation system the irrigation systems were turned on only during the dry season of each year for a total of 14 8 h day 1 during the enso event the irrigation system was operational from june 2015 to january 2016 supplying an average of 75 23 mm month but specific differences in additional water inputs under drip and sprinkler irrigation were not accounted for agropalma data despite differences in water irrigation regime along the dry season we did not observe conspicuous differences in individual palm trees size and height indeed the individuals presented a very homogenous structure in the three irrigation treatments 2 3 environmental parameters air temperature and relative humidity hmp50 campbell scientific inc logan ut usa net radiation cnr2 campbell scientific inc par li190sb campbell scientific inc and precipitation rg3 onset were monitored using a micrometeorological station installed in an open pasture 10 km from oil palm plots vpd was estimated from air temperature and relative humidity at 15 min intervals in the palm oil plantations we installed soil moisture sensors to obtain the soil volumetric water content vwc ec 5 decagon devices inc at three depths 20 50 and 100 cm in the three plots near the sap flow station 2 4 sap flow monitoring we selected at random five individual palm trees per treatment close to the place where we installed our base station with the data logger cr1000 campbell scientific inc logan utah usa this was done to limit the length of the cables used to connect the sensors with the data logging equipment we monitored palm water use with custom made sap flow sensors following the heat dissipation method hdm granier 1987 the hdm probes were built with 25 mm length and 19 gauge hypodermic needles while the resistance probe length was 20 mm the heated probe of each sensor was connected to a custom made current regulator that allowed us to maintain the heated probes at a constant power of 0 2 w cm 1 gutierrez lopez et al 2019 all sensors were designed and built at the university of campinas brazil the differential voltage between the heated and reference probes was read every 60 s and the average stored every 15 min we installed sap flow sensors on palm leaf petioles oriented to the north following the protocol recommended by niu et al 2015 we installed a total of 2 sensors per palm tree 10 15 cm from the base of the petiole we chose two leaves to install the sensors in each individual from the top to the bottom of the palm crown for each sample palm plant we chose one fully expanded leaf in the upper palm canopy strata higher inclination almost perpendicular to the ground surface and one fully expanded leaf in the lower canopy strata 45 35 inclination once installed all sensors were insulated with aluminium foil to protect against sudden changes in external temperature and to minimize the effects of natural temperature gradients known to affect these sensors lu et al 2004 do and rocheteau 2002 we installed 10 sensors per treatment total of 30 after performing data quality control noisy data resulting from equipment failure and power limitations were removed as a result the number of sensors used per site varied from a maximum of 10 when no noise or power loss occurred to an occasional minimum of 6 when noisy data had to be removed the total number of sensors used were six seven and nine sensors in control sprinkler and drip treatments distributed across five individuals per treatment respectively we calculated sap flux density js cm3 cm 2 h 1 using the exponential function suggested by granier 1987 js a k b where a and b are the equation parameters rederived by niu et al 2015 for palm trees a 48 24 b 1 60 and k is defined as k δ t max δ t δ t where δt c is the temperature difference between the heated and reference probes and δtmax c the maximum δt also considered the zero flow reference we determined daily δtmax fitting a kernel smoother cleveland and loader 1996 line to raw data that met the following conditions vpd 0 5 and par 50 the active water conductive area awc was determined following niu et al 2015 allometric equation first we assumed that the awc is a conservative trait for elaeis guineensis and the intraspecific plasticity is low among individuals of same age across population and same leaf size class we are based on the assumption that xylem anatomical properties of the palm fronds such vessel diameter vessel density and potential xylem conductivity are traits that present low plasticity among individuals growing at contrasting environmental conditions waite et al 2019 in this sense we used the linear coefficients slope 3 95 intercept 9 86 determined by niu et al 2015 to estimate the awc from the baseline length measured during the sensor installation to scale up our results from tree to plot scale we first multiplied the average hourly js estimated for all leaves of a given site by the estimated awc for each leaf and calculated the total leaf water use lwu kg h 1 the average daily lwu per individual kg day 1 was then multiplied by the average number of leaves per palm tree monitored per site n 5 and by the number of trees growing in one hectare n 152 this value was then divided by the respective area m2 see niu et al 2015 2 5 statistical analysis we used r 3 3 3 to perform all statistical analyses r core team 2017 in order to identify the enso effect on palm plantation t we split our data set into two time periods before the middle of january 2015 10 10 to 2016 01 15 n 98 days representing the dry season ds and the second between 2016 01 16 and 2016 04 15 n 91 days which was the period after the onset of rains until the end of sap flow monitoring referred to as the wet season ws the mid january date was chosen because it defined the transition between the dry and rainy season during the study year when precipitation resumed and an abrupt change in soil water content occurred fig 1a we performed a series of t tests to compare transpiration response between ds and ws and we performed an anova to compare palm t as a function of each irrigation treatment and season here in order to minimize day to day variability and estimate the trend cycle within the time series we used the moving average by considering the seven days average value for the sap flow and meteorological data in this sense we used linear and non linear models between two continuous variables when necessary to test the effect of vpd and soil moisture on the seven day average in t we performed a piecewise regression model with a broken line using the segmented package in r muggeo 2008 the model fits a nonlinear function with a non constant rate of change with a method of regression analysis where the response variable is split into two intervals i e the model is suitable in situations when the response variable shows abrupt changes within a few values of the explanatory variable using this approach we were able to identify the threshold when a certain value of vpd or par induced changes in palm transpiration additionally for each individual palm leaf we analysed the diurnal hysteresis in js with variation in vpd and par and we calculated the hysteresis area hvpd and hpar using the function polyarea using the geometry package habel et al 2015 this function calculates the area of a polygon by a triangle method this method requires that both variables have the same magnitude for this purpose we used normalized data and obtained an adimensional parameter we used a linear regression to test whether the hvpd or hpar was explained by the maximum daily vpd and par finally we performed a tukeyposthoc test to contrast average differences among groups 3 results 3 1 meteorological measurements and irrigation treatment effect during the ws par decreased by 28 as a result of increased cloud cover average 388 sd 72 µmol m 2 s 1 relative to ds available par average 442 73 µmol m 2 s 1 fig 1 the vpd variance was strongly correlated to par as estimated by the correlation between the predicted vs observed relationship derived by nonlinear regressions r2 64 a 491 6 b 129 5 c 0 60 p 0 001 the vpd variance was 52 linearly correlated with vwc r2 0 52 p 0 001 data not shown soil volumetric water content was higher under the drip irrigation treatment vwc 0 19 0 02 m3 m 3 and sprinkler irrigation treatment vwc 0 17 0 02 m3 m 3 and was significantly different from the control treatment vwc 0 14 0 03 m3 m 3 fig 2 we also observed seasonal differences in vwc among treatments fig 2 table 1 during the dry season vwc under the drip treatment was higher 0 19 0 023 m3 m 3 than the sprinkler treatment 0 15 0 01 m3 m 3 and the control showed the lowest vwc during ds 0 12 0 008 m3 m 3 fig 2 tukeyposthoc test after the beginning of the rainy season both sprinkler and drip treatments showed similar average vwc 0 21 0 02 m3 m 3 and 0 20 0 01 m3 m 3 respectively and control vwc was slightly lower compared to the two irrigation treatments 0 17 0 02 m3 m 3 fig 2 3 2 leaf water use lwu was significantly lower in the control plot 1 97 0 37 kg day 1 than in the drip 2 55 1 04 kg day 1 and sprinkler 2 12 0 50 kg day 1 treatment plots anova df 2 f 26 16 p 0 01 we also observed that the average amount of water used by upper leaves i e as indicated by their position within the palm tree crown and irrigation was consistently different fig 3a anova df 5 f 46 29 p 0 01 mainly for the upper leaf of drip and sprinkler treatments that was higher than in the control plot posthoc tukey test p 0 01 while the lower leaf presented a similar water use among treatments and posthoc tukey test p 0 01 considering the average leaf water use and the average number of leaves per palm n 50 we estimated that water consumption per palm was 98 7 18 127 58 52 and 106 4 25 kg day 1 for control drip and sprinkler irrigation treatments respectively fig 3b the best fit to explain the relationship between the seven day average lwu and vpdmax or parmax was a quadratic model table 2 fig s1 in general the vpdmax had a significant effect on seven days average of lwu variance only the upper leaves of control plants showed a negative correlation with vpd indicating that vpd exerts a control on water use in the youngest leaves under a drier atmosphere although the lower leaves also exhibited increases in lwu with increases in vpd this response was not at the same rates and magnitude as the lower leaves of palms growing in the drip and sprinkler treatments fig s1 table s1 nevertheless the lower leaves of the sprinkler treatment presented higher variability in the data similarly the par variance also had an effect on the seven days average of lwu fig s2 table s1 while the upper leaves in the control plot showed a negative correlation with par and the drip and sprinkler treatments tended to be constant or increase with parmax 3 3 stand water use the mean daily t estimated over the entire sap flow monitoring period was 1 50 0 28 mm day 1 for the control plot 1 93 0 79 mm day 1 for the drip treatment plot and 1 61 0 38 mm day 1 for the sprinkler treatment plot independent of treatment t was significantly higher during the dry season figs 4 and 5 table 2 test t p 0 01 however palm trees in both irrigation treatments sustained a higher t stand than control palms during ds mitigating some effects of the water supply deficit and maintaining transpiration despite the higher vpd fig 5 the t differences observed among treatments were also reflected in the fresh fruit bunch ffb production of oil palm table s2 from 2013 2016 the average ffb ha was 50 and 29 1 higher in sprinkler and drip treatments respectively compared to control treatments despite that the water use in drip treatment was higher than in sprinkler treatment the vpd variation presented a greater linear effect on driving t rates than par table 2 considering the t averaged for each seven days a linear model shows that vpd explains 63 66 and 54 of the t variation for control drip and sprinkler treatments p 0 01 table 2 whereas the par variation explained lower t variation for drip and sprinkler r2 0 23 and 0 30 respectively while for control plot the t showed no effect of par r2 0 12 p 0 05 table 2 based on a segmented piecewise regression the estimated break point when the response of t stand to par and vpd reached saturation and plateaued was different among treatments for both of these variables but overall the break point for the drip treatment presented higher values for vpd and par that for the control and sprinkler treatments fig 5 table 2 after reaching a certain vpd threshold in all treatments the slope of the second piecewise regressions became positive and rates of increases in t with increases in vpd were higher for both irrigation treatments fig 5 table 2 showing that irrigation was sufficient to alleviate the negative effects of low soil moisture due to drought on palm transpiration during the study periods when we analysed the effects of parmax and vpdmax on oil palm t using a multiple regression the results indicated that these parameters explained 73 of t control r2 0 73 f 21 41 71 df 23 p 0 01 71 of t drip r2 0 71 f 19 01 df 23 p 0 01 and 60 of t sprinkler r2 0 60 f 11 53 df 23 p 0 01 here for all treatments the multiple regressions resulted in no effect of par p 0 05 3 4 seasonal hysteresis effect leaf js exhibited a clockwise hysteresis with changes in hourly vpd hvpd resulting from larger js for a given vpd during the morning compared to the same vpd during the afternoon fig 6 there was a significant relationship between the interaction of season and treatment and differences in hvpd table 1 the hvpd varied among treatments and was much higher during ds compared to ws and this effect was more evident in both irrigation systems during ds showing a significantly larger hysteresis area than the control plot figs 6 and 7 table 1 for all treatments the hysteresis areas were strongly correlated with daily vpdmax fig s3 daily vpdmax explained 80 of hvpd of the control plot r2 0 80 a 0 11 b 0 09 p 0 001 whereas for the drip treatment daily maximum vpd explained 81 of hvpd r2 0 81 a 0 11 b 0 07 with similar slopes found in the control plot for the sprinkler treatment daily vpdmax explained 82 of hvpd r2 0 82 a 0 15 b 0 13 p 0 001 fig s3 in contrast the hysteresis effect derived from par hpar was less pronounced than that observed from vpd fig 6 leaf js exhibited two states of hpar one in the early morning and late afternoon when the hysteresis was counterclockwise and the other around midday to early afternoon when the hysteresis was clockwise fig 6 we did not find a significant effect in the interaction of season and treatment in explaining the hpar table 1 despite that comparing the two irrigation treatments hpar was largest in the sprinkler treatment fig 7 tukey post hoc test p 0 001 and this pattern was also observed when we analyzed the ws alone fig 7 there was a stronger seasonal effect on hpar in the control and sprinkler treatment while for the drip treatment the hpar was similar among seasons fig 7 daily parmax only explained 34 of hpar for the control treatment r2 0 34 a 7 92 10 5 b 3 78 10 2 p 0 001 whereas for the drip treatment daily parmax explained 41 of hpar r2 0 41 a 1 26 10 4 b 2 66 10 2 p 0 001 for the sprinkler treatment daily parmax explained 35 of hpar r2 0 35 a 8 48 10 5 b 2 28 10 2 p 0 001 fig s3 4 discussion 4 1 contrasting water supply and overall oil palm tree transpiration increased water supply resulted in higher t stand for trees growing under the drip and sprinkler treatments both irrigation systems increased t stand but the drip system surprisingly allowed for a higher transpiration rate at the peak of the ds by about 1 mm compared to the more conservative water use in the control and sprinkler treatments figs 3 and 4 regardless of the treatment palm trees were able to sustain higher transpiration rates during the ds than ws fig 5 but it is clear that the seasonal differences were more accentuated in palm trees growing under irrigation these results reinforce that palm oil production is limited by reductions in access to soil water when environmental conditions result in stomatal closure smith 1989 meijide et al 2017 in fact productivity assessed according to fresh fruit production per hectare was around 35 and 26 higher in palm trees growing in the sprinkler and drip treatment plots compared to the control plot respectively during enso 2015 table s2 earlier irrigation experiments show that applying around 5 mm of water day 1 increased annual yields from 10 18 t ha 1 to 22 23 t ha 1 this increase in productivity is explained because the additional water supply during the dry season has a positive feedback on increasing the sex ratio in palm inflorescence and reducing abortion loss carr 2011 the magnitude of the stand transpiration estimates in our study are in concordance with a recent study performed in oil plantations in sumatra indonesia röll et al 2015 showed that 6 24 year old oil palm individuals transpired an average of 1 3 mm day 1 in our study sites for 5 year old oil palm plantations independent of irrigation systems the average daily transpiration ranged from 1 50 to 1 93 mm day 1 which is similar to the amount of water used in plantations up to 5 years as demonstrated by röll et al 2015 despite that sap flow measurement in oil palm might underestimate significant transpiration of oil palm plantations as suggested by modeling studies that report much about 4 mm day 1 manoli et al 2018 considering the amount of net radiation received in the eastern amazon a likely total evapotranspiration flux will be in the order of 3 0 3 5 mm day 1 miralles et al 2015 and only the drip treatment reached such values in the peak of ds during enso in contrast to recent studies performed in colombia bayona rodríguez and romero 2016 showed that similar to our results the water use from upper young leaves was higher than lower older ones in five year old palm trees they estimated the average 80 5 kg day 1 along 12 days of measurements whereas the average individual palm water use for the same age in our site ranged from 98 to 127 kg day 1 fig 1 indeed the palm water use variability was high in our site fig 3 in drip treatments some palms transpired above 200 kg day 1 the higher t stand in the drip compared to the sprinkler treatment was not expected the irrigation given by the sprinkler system allowed much higher fresh fruit bunch production despite that our estimates of palm transpiration was lower in sprinkler than in drip treatment a possible explanation is that water in the sprinkler system might be reaching the leaves mitigating the water deficit around the leaf boundary layer and reducing palm transpiration thereby creating a positive feedback to palm productivity by reducing water loss gerlein safdi et al 2018 alternatively the water from the sprinkler system might reach the sensor at petiole location which could cause changes in the heat transfer rate from the heated needle resulting in misinterpretation of the data when studying temporal dynamics or sap flow hölttä et al 2015 unfortunately the lack of instrumentation at the local scale within each treatment precludes a better understanding of why such differences occurred 4 2 environmental drivers of palm transpiration in general the environmental drivers controlling t were correlated with leaf water use across the weeks and consequently with t stand fig 5 s1 and s2 table 2 and s1 as previously shown by other studies with palm oil niu et al 2015 röll et al 2015 the effect of vpd was higher than par as a driver to determine leaf transpiration in fact the palm transpiration in response to par was negatively affected by the reduced availability of water to support palm transpiration in the control plot table 2 showing that drought negatively feedback with the maximum light utilization reflected in lower palm productivity table s2 in addition the upper leaves within the palm frond were more sensible to increases in atmospheric vpd in the control plot while lower leaves tended to increase with increase in maximum vpd in all treatments fig s1 we highlight that within the palm fronds exist differences to higher vpd tolerance lower and old leaves or avoidance upper and newer leaves mechanism among leaves upper leaves have been shown to exhibit mostly conservative behaviour maintaining the integrity of its water transport system through sensitive stomatal control of water loss meijide et al 2017 waite et al 2019 we could expect that there may exist considerable variation in tolerance to xylem embolism among leaves within the palm fronds emilio et al 2019 waite et al 2019 in addition to this framework considering the piecewise segmented relationship analysis we demonstrated that the higher slope of the second segment was much higher in the drip and sprinkler treatments compared to the control table 1 these results confirm the relatively high palm sensitivity to drought and the expected stomatal regulation to a higher vpd at stand level meijide et al 2017 waite et al 2019 while an increase in soil water moisture due to irrigation compensated the atmospheric drought to sustain continued transpitration 4 3 underlying drivers of hysteresis pattern in oil palm transpiration there were clear patterns of hysteresis observed for sap flux density as a function of vpd and par independent of the irrigation treatment fig 6 similar to the results by niu et al 2015 and röll et al 2015 in indonesian oil palm plantations the magnitude of js rates were 25 higher in both irrigation treatments than in control plots when vpd reached a threshold about 1 kpa in the late afternoon js rates were always lower than 4 g cm 2 h 1 which may indicate an associated process derived from higher stomatal regulation and leaf and trunk water depletion in the control plot meijide et al 2017 therefore we did not confirm our initial hypothesis that hysteresis area would be largest for the control treatment as there was an opposite trend showing an increase in hysteresis area in both irrigation treatments when soil water supply was higher during the ds our findings suggest that the hysteresis effect cannot be explained solely by an increase in the resistance along the soil plant atmosphere continuum which is the argument used to explain the hysteresis effect in woody species o grady et al 1999 zeppel et al 2004 we suggest that the hysteresis effect in palm tree js might be attributed to an increase in stem refilling capacitance derived by water refilling during nighttime hours because of the irrigation yang et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 sperling et al 2014 in fact in our study the higher hysteresis resulted from an alleviation to the soil plant hydraulic constraints resulting in higher t in the morning than the afternoon vpd clockwise mainly in the irrigation treatment in fact about 60 of the fresh weight of palm leaves corresponds to water content stored in leaf parenchyma islam et al 2000 and the internal trunk water storage is considered an important water source to maintain higher stomatal conductance and gross primary productivity in palm oil plantations meijide et al 2017 the most interesting hpar pattern observed among seasons and among treatments was the butterfly hysteresis direction form fig 5 which was also described in an indonesian palm oil plantation in response to net radiation niu et al 2015 röll et al 2015 in the early morning to midday when the hpar was clockwise the hysteresis pattern was driven by an interaction between vpd and par however after a vpd threshold 1 kpa was reached the js rates started to decrease when par reached about 600 µmol m 2 s 1 almost half the maximum daily par fig 6 confirming that palm productivity is more limited by atmospheric water stress than light availability figs 6 and 7 and table 2 in fact earlier studies have shown reductions in stomatal conductance when vpd exceed 1 7 2 kpa even if soil moisture is plentiful smith 1989 henson 1991 dufrêne and saugier 1993 meijide et al 2017 indicating that the observed asymmetric shape of js in response to par might affect the diurnal cycle of palm carbon assimilation along the dry season due to limitations to photosynthesis induced by high vpd rates rees 1961 carr 2011 or to an enhanced respiration induced by higher temperature pingintha et al 2010 in addition our results highlight that the additional soil water supply from irrigation ameliorated this limitation indicating an efficient use of light in both irrigation treatments figs 6 and 7 the intercept of a linear regression between hpar and parmax was higher in the control plot than in both irrigation treatments fig s3 indicating that irrigation increases light use efficiency only during the early hours of the morning was js likely primarily driven by par during this period vpd was small 0 5 kpa and js was strongly correlated to par fig 5 in contrast during late afternoon after 4 p m the magnitude of js was relatively higher even with reduced par close to zero indicating that the js was primarily driven by changes in vpd during this period 5 conclusion in our study we provide the first measurements of water fluxes in amazonian oil palm plantations under an extreme drought induced by enso our study and results are unique because this experimental design increased the understanding of the associated effects of atmosphere and soil drought on palm water use our results support our initial hypothesis h1 showing that the control treatment plot presented a more conservative water use during the ds while drip irrigation plots had significantly higher transpiration rates however the water surplus by the sprinkler system guaranteed about 10 higher production during 2015 and 2016 this strongly suggests that both irrigation systems are sufficient to mitigate drought effects but in terms of total drupe yield the sprinkler irrigation system has a higher efficiency the results also supported h2 as there is a clear relationship between the environmental drivers par and vpd and oil palm transpiration at the leaf level as well as at the stand level across the weeks the vpd was more important to drive oil palm transpiration and par determining transpiration was more strongly affected by drought in fact palm trees conserve water under drought conditions and the upper leaves are more sensitive to vpd variation than older lower leaves lastly we demonstrated that hysteresis area was strongly determined by daily vpd intensity in all treatments h3 conversely we showed that hysteresis area in response to vpd and par was higher in both irrigation treatments in contrast to the control plot we suggest that the additional soil water supply provided by irrigation allowed for an increase in the internal water storage which allowed for higher oil palm water use in the morning our study highlights the sensitivity of oil palm trees to water stress with strong regulation of transpiration rates in the control plot but also indicates that additional water supply can mitigate this stress and increase their resilience to drought and potentially increase productivity during these periods the sprinkler system is recommended for increasing palm yield productivity but drip irrigation also mitigates drought stress and increases productivity in contrast to unirrigated controls authors contribution all

10273,oil palm plantations are rapidly expanding in the brazilian eastern amazon further expansion of irrigated oil palm plantations may occur because they may improve productivity during drought events compared to rainfed only plantations to investigate the importance of irrigation to alleviate drought induced stress on palm trees and its potential as a management alternative we monitored transpiration t mm day 1 in a five year old oil palm plantation during an extreme drought caused by the el niño southern oscillation enso event in the amazon basin our study spanned over the dry season ds and the wet season ws using an ongoing irrigation experiment control with no irrigation drip and sprinkler irrigation to identify how differences in water supply affect the oil palm t during a period of reduced precipitation induced by enso our results indicate that independently of the irrigation system t was higher in the ds compared to the ws higher soil moisture in both the irrigation treatments relative to the control plot allowed for 23 higher average t relative to the control plot the vapor pressure deficit vpd variation presented a higher effect over oil palm transpiration than photosynthetic active radiation in both irrigation systems a higher rate of transpiration with increases in vpd was observed than in the control plot during enso drought additionally within individual palm fronds we also observed differences in vpd tolerance higher for lower and older leaves and avoidance higher for upper and newer leaves results indicate that irrigation increased fruit production by 35 and 26 in the sprinkler and drip irrigation systems respectively overall these results demonstrate the potential role of irrigation to alleviate water stress and maintain productivity of palm oil plantations during periods of moisture stress while highlighting the possible feedback of increasing transpiration on water balance and hydrologic regulation keywords sap flow hysteresis drought oil palm irrigation enso el niño 1 introduction sustainability of palm oil plantations relies directly on their capacity to maintain productivity under changing environmental conditions the response of palm plantations to climate change in the near future is of great interest in the 21st century zainal et al 2012 paterson and lima 2018 sarkar et al 2020 the shift from forests to perennial crop plantations can alter the hydrological cycles thereby changing ecosystem function reducing crop production and damaging socioeconomic related systems asbjornsen et al 2015 manoli et al 2018 in tropical countries such as in southeast asia manoli et al 2018 the brazilian amazon villela et al 2014 southeast of mexico pischke et al 2018 and parts of tropical west africa carr 2011 land is rapidly being converted to oil palm tree plantations elaeis guineensis jacq additionally low productivity during the dry season often leads to compensatory management strategies such as expansion of the planted area to maintain total yields considering the sharply contrasting water relations and water use patterns between palm and forest trees röll et al 2019 hardanto et al 2017 it is important to understand how this conversion will impact the hydrology of these ecosystems in addition severe droughts during el niño southern oscillation events frequently occur across the eastern amazon a region dedicated to growing palm oil in brazil brum et al 2018 however the degree to which the frequency magnitude and spatial extent of such climate anomalies are impacting cropland productivity in these regions is still unknown e g heino et al 2018 palm trees are adapted to warm and humid tropical environments and therefore have high leaf area and high water use niu et al 2015 röll et al 2015 meijide et al 2017 at the plant level there are no visible signs of leaf wilting during periods of moisture stress due the high fibrous tissue thick hypodermis and well developed cuticle characteristic of palm tree leaves rees 1961 carr 2011 nonetheless studies have observed that palm trees can be negatively affected by reductions in soil moisture and increasing vapor pressure deficit vpd kpa which are commonly observed during drought events carr 2011 initially stomatal closure reduces transpiration and lowers carbon uptake and expected yield meijide et al 2017 additionally changes in the sexual ratio of palm inflorescences which is another morphological response to drought can result in reductions in yield while pre mature abortion of fruits and flowers disrupts the long term productivity of palm oil plantations carr 2011 management strategies to mitigate low productivity as a result of drought or limiting soil moisture include selection of palm hybrids resistant to water stress cochard et al 2005 modifications to the industrial processing of drupes palm oil fruit or artificial increments of soil water availability by means of irrigation palat et al 2008 carr 2011 however environmental conditions that result in limiting soil moisture deficits tend to occur over relatively short periods of time compared to the growing season hence the use of easily deployed equipment such as drip irrigation can be beneficial the specific physiological responses of palm oil to hydrologic stress and the capacity to increase yield via different irrigation regimes are not well understood moreover potential tradeoffs between irrigation enhanced productivity and reduced water yield due to increased plant water use are typically not considered irrigation studies in thailand palat et al 2008 and in colombia culman et al 2019 have shown that irrigation contributed to yield by increasing the production of fresh fruit bunches by 50 and 27 respectively nonetheless while productivity increases under irrigation the differences in total daily water use by palm trees are often unknown in plant species that are adapted to constant environmental stress i e changes in soil water availability and high temperature fluctuations the peak of the diel transpiration is often shifted and a greater transpiration is observed in the afternoon when the vpd is low carr 2011 meijide et al 2017 this shift in the lag response or hysteresis between environmental factors such as vpd and par provides a unique opportunity to understand how irrigation might mitigate the effects of drought sap flow sensors are commonly used to provide continuous high resolution measurements of diel water use dynamics in palm oil niu et al 2015 röll et al 2015 and to analyze diel patterns of transpiration in relation to vpd and photosynthetically active radiation par such studies have allowed for a better understanding of the magnitude of the hysteresis between tree transpiration and various environmental factors additionally understanding how irrigation affects the transpiration and productivity of palm oil plantations can lead to more efficient management of water resources to enhance palm oil production thereby improving the sustainability of these production systems culman et al 2019 in this study we aimed to improve our understanding of how drought affects transpiration rates in palm oil plantations and the role of irrigation in alleviating hydrological stress we took advantage of the ongoing irrigation experiments at agropalma a palm oil production company in brazil to understand how artificially increasing available soil water contributes to reducing hydrologic stress and maintaining productivity under extreme drought conditions we monitored palm sap flow during one of the most extreme enso induced droughts ever recorded across the amazon basin jiménez muñoz et al 2016 and in our study site brum et al 2018 we used contrasting irrigation systems in an ongoing experiment i e control with no irrigation drip irrigation and sprinkler irrigation to assess the effectiveness of two irrigation systems in alleviating drought induced water stress while several studies have addressed the effects of irrigation in palm plantations see carr 2011 palat et al 2008 safitri et al 2019 to our knowledge no other study has addressed the potential effects of irrigation of palm oil plantations as a management alternative to severe drought in the brazilian eastern amazon specifically we addressed the following questions and hypotheses 1 what is the relative reduction in transpiration and associated productivity in palm plantations during the wet and dry seasons during a severe enso event drought h1 our first hypothesis is that the enso induced drought on palm t will be significantly alleviated by irrigation due to the higher soil water availability we expect higher t rates during the dry season in irrigated systems compared to the control 2 does irrigation increase palm oil plant tolerance to high vpd or par during an enso year and reduce whole plant level hydrological stress how do drip vs sprinkler irrigation systems differ in their effectiveness h2 we hypothesize that vpd will have a significantly stronger effect on regulating palm t compared to par palm trees are adapted to grow in open fields under high solar radiation conditions however high vpd resulting from drought is an abnormal situation in humid tropical climates that is known to induce water loss regulation additionally we expect that drip irrigation system will be more efficient at increasing vpd tolerance specifically because it increases soil water availability while leaving the leaf boundary unaffected 3 how is the lag or hysteresis pattern of diel transpiration affected by irrigation and is the irrigation induced hysteresis different from the pattern observed in a non irrigated plantation h3 we expect larger hysteresis areas between vpd and par and plant transpiration in unirrigated plantations compared to irrigated ones given that the lag or hysteresis between transpiration and vpd or par increases as a result of increasing resistance to water flow we expect larger hysteresis areas in the dry season and in non irrigated plantations regardless of the season the results from this study will have implications for managing water use and productivity of palm oil plantations grown in environments where irrigation might be needed as part of their management 2 materials and methods this study was conducted from october 2015 middle of the dry season ds to april 2016 middle of the rainy season ws in a five year old palm oil plantation belonging to agropalma company in tailândia pa brazil 2 31 s 48 47 w at 40 m altitude a s l 2 1 enso drought characterization we conducted our study during the most extreme drought on record in this part of the amazon basin jiménez muñoz et al 2016 with a palmer drought severity index below 3 throughout much of the eastern amazon temperatures during the 2015 2016 enso reached a record of 1 5 and 2 c higher than the maximum temperature observed during enso events in 1997 october and 1983 january respectively jiménez muñoz et al 2016 based on data from our meteorological station the precipitation from october 2015 to april 2016 was 1698 mm the ds period from october 2015 to mid january 2015 was under the influence of enso and received 442 mm of rainfall compared to the long term average from 1983 to 2017 for this period of 651 mm which represents a reduction of 32 data from brum et al 2018 the maximum temperature measured was 38 39 c and the period with the strongest water deficits occurred from november 10 to december 1 2015 during these 21 days there was no precipitation and vpd reached 4 5 kpa around midday daily average 2 1 kpa 2 2 irrigation experimental design we used an ongoing irrigation experiment located on agropalma company lands to continuously monitor water use in palm plantations with contrasting irrigation systems during the enso drought the palm trees were planted in 2010 and were grown under different water availability regimes a control treatment with no irrigation a treatment area with a drip irrigation system and a treatment area with a sprinkler irrigation system the irrigation systems were turned on only during the dry season of each year for a total of 14 8 h day 1 during the enso event the irrigation system was operational from june 2015 to january 2016 supplying an average of 75 23 mm month but specific differences in additional water inputs under drip and sprinkler irrigation were not accounted for agropalma data despite differences in water irrigation regime along the dry season we did not observe conspicuous differences in individual palm trees size and height indeed the individuals presented a very homogenous structure in the three irrigation treatments 2 3 environmental parameters air temperature and relative humidity hmp50 campbell scientific inc logan ut usa net radiation cnr2 campbell scientific inc par li190sb campbell scientific inc and precipitation rg3 onset were monitored using a micrometeorological station installed in an open pasture 10 km from oil palm plots vpd was estimated from air temperature and relative humidity at 15 min intervals in the palm oil plantations we installed soil moisture sensors to obtain the soil volumetric water content vwc ec 5 decagon devices inc at three depths 20 50 and 100 cm in the three plots near the sap flow station 2 4 sap flow monitoring we selected at random five individual palm trees per treatment close to the place where we installed our base station with the data logger cr1000 campbell scientific inc logan utah usa this was done to limit the length of the cables used to connect the sensors with the data logging equipment we monitored palm water use with custom made sap flow sensors following the heat dissipation method hdm granier 1987 the hdm probes were built with 25 mm length and 19 gauge hypodermic needles while the resistance probe length was 20 mm the heated probe of each sensor was connected to a custom made current regulator that allowed us to maintain the heated probes at a constant power of 0 2 w cm 1 gutierrez lopez et al 2019 all sensors were designed and built at the university of campinas brazil the differential voltage between the heated and reference probes was read every 60 s and the average stored every 15 min we installed sap flow sensors on palm leaf petioles oriented to the north following the protocol recommended by niu et al 2015 we installed a total of 2 sensors per palm tree 10 15 cm from the base of the petiole we chose two leaves to install the sensors in each individual from the top to the bottom of the palm crown for each sample palm plant we chose one fully expanded leaf in the upper palm canopy strata higher inclination almost perpendicular to the ground surface and one fully expanded leaf in the lower canopy strata 45 35 inclination once installed all sensors were insulated with aluminium foil to protect against sudden changes in external temperature and to minimize the effects of natural temperature gradients known to affect these sensors lu et al 2004 do and rocheteau 2002 we installed 10 sensors per treatment total of 30 after performing data quality control noisy data resulting from equipment failure and power limitations were removed as a result the number of sensors used per site varied from a maximum of 10 when no noise or power loss occurred to an occasional minimum of 6 when noisy data had to be removed the total number of sensors used were six seven and nine sensors in control sprinkler and drip treatments distributed across five individuals per treatment respectively we calculated sap flux density js cm3 cm 2 h 1 using the exponential function suggested by granier 1987 js a k b where a and b are the equation parameters rederived by niu et al 2015 for palm trees a 48 24 b 1 60 and k is defined as k δ t max δ t δ t where δt c is the temperature difference between the heated and reference probes and δtmax c the maximum δt also considered the zero flow reference we determined daily δtmax fitting a kernel smoother cleveland and loader 1996 line to raw data that met the following conditions vpd 0 5 and par 50 the active water conductive area awc was determined following niu et al 2015 allometric equation first we assumed that the awc is a conservative trait for elaeis guineensis and the intraspecific plasticity is low among individuals of same age across population and same leaf size class we are based on the assumption that xylem anatomical properties of the palm fronds such vessel diameter vessel density and potential xylem conductivity are traits that present low plasticity among individuals growing at contrasting environmental conditions waite et al 2019 in this sense we used the linear coefficients slope 3 95 intercept 9 86 determined by niu et al 2015 to estimate the awc from the baseline length measured during the sensor installation to scale up our results from tree to plot scale we first multiplied the average hourly js estimated for all leaves of a given site by the estimated awc for each leaf and calculated the total leaf water use lwu kg h 1 the average daily lwu per individual kg day 1 was then multiplied by the average number of leaves per palm tree monitored per site n 5 and by the number of trees growing in one hectare n 152 this value was then divided by the respective area m2 see niu et al 2015 2 5 statistical analysis we used r 3 3 3 to perform all statistical analyses r core team 2017 in order to identify the enso effect on palm plantation t we split our data set into two time periods before the middle of january 2015 10 10 to 2016 01 15 n 98 days representing the dry season ds and the second between 2016 01 16 and 2016 04 15 n 91 days which was the period after the onset of rains until the end of sap flow monitoring referred to as the wet season ws the mid january date was chosen because it defined the transition between the dry and rainy season during the study year when precipitation resumed and an abrupt change in soil water content occurred fig 1a we performed a series of t tests to compare transpiration response between ds and ws and we performed an anova to compare palm t as a function of each irrigation treatment and season here in order to minimize day to day variability and estimate the trend cycle within the time series we used the moving average by considering the seven days average value for the sap flow and meteorological data in this sense we used linear and non linear models between two continuous variables when necessary to test the effect of vpd and soil moisture on the seven day average in t we performed a piecewise regression model with a broken line using the segmented package in r muggeo 2008 the model fits a nonlinear function with a non constant rate of change with a method of regression analysis where the response variable is split into two intervals i e the model is suitable in situations when the response variable shows abrupt changes within a few values of the explanatory variable using this approach we were able to identify the threshold when a certain value of vpd or par induced changes in palm transpiration additionally for each individual palm leaf we analysed the diurnal hysteresis in js with variation in vpd and par and we calculated the hysteresis area hvpd and hpar using the function polyarea using the geometry package habel et al 2015 this function calculates the area of a polygon by a triangle method this method requires that both variables have the same magnitude for this purpose we used normalized data and obtained an adimensional parameter we used a linear regression to test whether the hvpd or hpar was explained by the maximum daily vpd and par finally we performed a tukeyposthoc test to contrast average differences among groups 3 results 3 1 meteorological measurements and irrigation treatment effect during the ws par decreased by 28 as a result of increased cloud cover average 388 sd 72 µmol m 2 s 1 relative to ds available par average 442 73 µmol m 2 s 1 fig 1 the vpd variance was strongly correlated to par as estimated by the correlation between the predicted vs observed relationship derived by nonlinear regressions r2 64 a 491 6 b 129 5 c 0 60 p 0 001 the vpd variance was 52 linearly correlated with vwc r2 0 52 p 0 001 data not shown soil volumetric water content was higher under the drip irrigation treatment vwc 0 19 0 02 m3 m 3 and sprinkler irrigation treatment vwc 0 17 0 02 m3 m 3 and was significantly different from the control treatment vwc 0 14 0 03 m3 m 3 fig 2 we also observed seasonal differences in vwc among treatments fig 2 table 1 during the dry season vwc under the drip treatment was higher 0 19 0 023 m3 m 3 than the sprinkler treatment 0 15 0 01 m3 m 3 and the control showed the lowest vwc during ds 0 12 0 008 m3 m 3 fig 2 tukeyposthoc test after the beginning of the rainy season both sprinkler and drip treatments showed similar average vwc 0 21 0 02 m3 m 3 and 0 20 0 01 m3 m 3 respectively and control vwc was slightly lower compared to the two irrigation treatments 0 17 0 02 m3 m 3 fig 2 3 2 leaf water use lwu was significantly lower in the control plot 1 97 0 37 kg day 1 than in the drip 2 55 1 04 kg day 1 and sprinkler 2 12 0 50 kg day 1 treatment plots anova df 2 f 26 16 p 0 01 we also observed that the average amount of water used by upper leaves i e as indicated by their position within the palm tree crown and irrigation was consistently different fig 3a anova df 5 f 46 29 p 0 01 mainly for the upper leaf of drip and sprinkler treatments that was higher than in the control plot posthoc tukey test p 0 01 while the lower leaf presented a similar water use among treatments and posthoc tukey test p 0 01 considering the average leaf water use and the average number of leaves per palm n 50 we estimated that water consumption per palm was 98 7 18 127 58 52 and 106 4 25 kg day 1 for control drip and sprinkler irrigation treatments respectively fig 3b the best fit to explain the relationship between the seven day average lwu and vpdmax or parmax was a quadratic model table 2 fig s1 in general the vpdmax had a significant effect on seven days average of lwu variance only the upper leaves of control plants showed a negative correlation with vpd indicating that vpd exerts a control on water use in the youngest leaves under a drier atmosphere although the lower leaves also exhibited increases in lwu with increases in vpd this response was not at the same rates and magnitude as the lower leaves of palms growing in the drip and sprinkler treatments fig s1 table s1 nevertheless the lower leaves of the sprinkler treatment presented higher variability in the data similarly the par variance also had an effect on the seven days average of lwu fig s2 table s1 while the upper leaves in the control plot showed a negative correlation with par and the drip and sprinkler treatments tended to be constant or increase with parmax 3 3 stand water use the mean daily t estimated over the entire sap flow monitoring period was 1 50 0 28 mm day 1 for the control plot 1 93 0 79 mm day 1 for the drip treatment plot and 1 61 0 38 mm day 1 for the sprinkler treatment plot independent of treatment t was significantly higher during the dry season figs 4 and 5 table 2 test t p 0 01 however palm trees in both irrigation treatments sustained a higher t stand than control palms during ds mitigating some effects of the water supply deficit and maintaining transpiration despite the higher vpd fig 5 the t differences observed among treatments were also reflected in the fresh fruit bunch ffb production of oil palm table s2 from 2013 2016 the average ffb ha was 50 and 29 1 higher in sprinkler and drip treatments respectively compared to control treatments despite that the water use in drip treatment was higher than in sprinkler treatment the vpd variation presented a greater linear effect on driving t rates than par table 2 considering the t averaged for each seven days a linear model shows that vpd explains 63 66 and 54 of the t variation for control drip and sprinkler treatments p 0 01 table 2 whereas the par variation explained lower t variation for drip and sprinkler r2 0 23 and 0 30 respectively while for control plot the t showed no effect of par r2 0 12 p 0 05 table 2 based on a segmented piecewise regression the estimated break point when the response of t stand to par and vpd reached saturation and plateaued was different among treatments for both of these variables but overall the break point for the drip treatment presented higher values for vpd and par that for the control and sprinkler treatments fig 5 table 2 after reaching a certain vpd threshold in all treatments the slope of the second piecewise regressions became positive and rates of increases in t with increases in vpd were higher for both irrigation treatments fig 5 table 2 showing that irrigation was sufficient to alleviate the negative effects of low soil moisture due to drought on palm transpiration during the study periods when we analysed the effects of parmax and vpdmax on oil palm t using a multiple regression the results indicated that these parameters explained 73 of t control r2 0 73 f 21 41 71 df 23 p 0 01 71 of t drip r2 0 71 f 19 01 df 23 p 0 01 and 60 of t sprinkler r2 0 60 f 11 53 df 23 p 0 01 here for all treatments the multiple regressions resulted in no effect of par p 0 05 3 4 seasonal hysteresis effect leaf js exhibited a clockwise hysteresis with changes in hourly vpd hvpd resulting from larger js for a given vpd during the morning compared to the same vpd during the afternoon fig 6 there was a significant relationship between the interaction of season and treatment and differences in hvpd table 1 the hvpd varied among treatments and was much higher during ds compared to ws and this effect was more evident in both irrigation systems during ds showing a significantly larger hysteresis area than the control plot figs 6 and 7 table 1 for all treatments the hysteresis areas were strongly correlated with daily vpdmax fig s3 daily vpdmax explained 80 of hvpd of the control plot r2 0 80 a 0 11 b 0 09 p 0 001 whereas for the drip treatment daily maximum vpd explained 81 of hvpd r2 0 81 a 0 11 b 0 07 with similar slopes found in the control plot for the sprinkler treatment daily vpdmax explained 82 of hvpd r2 0 82 a 0 15 b 0 13 p 0 001 fig s3 in contrast the hysteresis effect derived from par hpar was less pronounced than that observed from vpd fig 6 leaf js exhibited two states of hpar one in the early morning and late afternoon when the hysteresis was counterclockwise and the other around midday to early afternoon when the hysteresis was clockwise fig 6 we did not find a significant effect in the interaction of season and treatment in explaining the hpar table 1 despite that comparing the two irrigation treatments hpar was largest in the sprinkler treatment fig 7 tukey post hoc test p 0 001 and this pattern was also observed when we analyzed the ws alone fig 7 there was a stronger seasonal effect on hpar in the control and sprinkler treatment while for the drip treatment the hpar was similar among seasons fig 7 daily parmax only explained 34 of hpar for the control treatment r2 0 34 a 7 92 10 5 b 3 78 10 2 p 0 001 whereas for the drip treatment daily parmax explained 41 of hpar r2 0 41 a 1 26 10 4 b 2 66 10 2 p 0 001 for the sprinkler treatment daily parmax explained 35 of hpar r2 0 35 a 8 48 10 5 b 2 28 10 2 p 0 001 fig s3 4 discussion 4 1 contrasting water supply and overall oil palm tree transpiration increased water supply resulted in higher t stand for trees growing under the drip and sprinkler treatments both irrigation systems increased t stand but the drip system surprisingly allowed for a higher transpiration rate at the peak of the ds by about 1 mm compared to the more conservative water use in the control and sprinkler treatments figs 3 and 4 regardless of the treatment palm trees were able to sustain higher transpiration rates during the ds than ws fig 5 but it is clear that the seasonal differences were more accentuated in palm trees growing under irrigation these results reinforce that palm oil production is limited by reductions in access to soil water when environmental conditions result in stomatal closure smith 1989 meijide et al 2017 in fact productivity assessed according to fresh fruit production per hectare was around 35 and 26 higher in palm trees growing in the sprinkler and drip treatment plots compared to the control plot respectively during enso 2015 table s2 earlier irrigation experiments show that applying around 5 mm of water day 1 increased annual yields from 10 18 t ha 1 to 22 23 t ha 1 this increase in productivity is explained because the additional water supply during the dry season has a positive feedback on increasing the sex ratio in palm inflorescence and reducing abortion loss carr 2011 the magnitude of the stand transpiration estimates in our study are in concordance with a recent study performed in oil plantations in sumatra indonesia röll et al 2015 showed that 6 24 year old oil palm individuals transpired an average of 1 3 mm day 1 in our study sites for 5 year old oil palm plantations independent of irrigation systems the average daily transpiration ranged from 1 50 to 1 93 mm day 1 which is similar to the amount of water used in plantations up to 5 years as demonstrated by röll et al 2015 despite that sap flow measurement in oil palm might underestimate significant transpiration of oil palm plantations as suggested by modeling studies that report much about 4 mm day 1 manoli et al 2018 considering the amount of net radiation received in the eastern amazon a likely total evapotranspiration flux will be in the order of 3 0 3 5 mm day 1 miralles et al 2015 and only the drip treatment reached such values in the peak of ds during enso in contrast to recent studies performed in colombia bayona rodríguez and romero 2016 showed that similar to our results the water use from upper young leaves was higher than lower older ones in five year old palm trees they estimated the average 80 5 kg day 1 along 12 days of measurements whereas the average individual palm water use for the same age in our site ranged from 98 to 127 kg day 1 fig 1 indeed the palm water use variability was high in our site fig 3 in drip treatments some palms transpired above 200 kg day 1 the higher t stand in the drip compared to the sprinkler treatment was not expected the irrigation given by the sprinkler system allowed much higher fresh fruit bunch production despite that our estimates of palm transpiration was lower in sprinkler than in drip treatment a possible explanation is that water in the sprinkler system might be reaching the leaves mitigating the water deficit around the leaf boundary layer and reducing palm transpiration thereby creating a positive feedback to palm productivity by reducing water loss gerlein safdi et al 2018 alternatively the water from the sprinkler system might reach the sensor at petiole location which could cause changes in the heat transfer rate from the heated needle resulting in misinterpretation of the data when studying temporal dynamics or sap flow hölttä et al 2015 unfortunately the lack of instrumentation at the local scale within each treatment precludes a better understanding of why such differences occurred 4 2 environmental drivers of palm transpiration in general the environmental drivers controlling t were correlated with leaf water use across the weeks and consequently with t stand fig 5 s1 and s2 table 2 and s1 as previously shown by other studies with palm oil niu et al 2015 röll et al 2015 the effect of vpd was higher than par as a driver to determine leaf transpiration in fact the palm transpiration in response to par was negatively affected by the reduced availability of water to support palm transpiration in the control plot table 2 showing that drought negatively feedback with the maximum light utilization reflected in lower palm productivity table s2 in addition the upper leaves within the palm frond were more sensible to increases in atmospheric vpd in the control plot while lower leaves tended to increase with increase in maximum vpd in all treatments fig s1 we highlight that within the palm fronds exist differences to higher vpd tolerance lower and old leaves or avoidance upper and newer leaves mechanism among leaves upper leaves have been shown to exhibit mostly conservative behaviour maintaining the integrity of its water transport system through sensitive stomatal control of water loss meijide et al 2017 waite et al 2019 we could expect that there may exist considerable variation in tolerance to xylem embolism among leaves within the palm fronds emilio et al 2019 waite et al 2019 in addition to this framework considering the piecewise segmented relationship analysis we demonstrated that the higher slope of the second segment was much higher in the drip and sprinkler treatments compared to the control table 1 these results confirm the relatively high palm sensitivity to drought and the expected stomatal regulation to a higher vpd at stand level meijide et al 2017 waite et al 2019 while an increase in soil water moisture due to irrigation compensated the atmospheric drought to sustain continued transpitration 4 3 underlying drivers of hysteresis pattern in oil palm transpiration there were clear patterns of hysteresis observed for sap flux density as a function of vpd and par independent of the irrigation treatment fig 6 similar to the results by niu et al 2015 and röll et al 2015 in indonesian oil palm plantations the magnitude of js rates were 25 higher in both irrigation treatments than in control plots when vpd reached a threshold about 1 kpa in the late afternoon js rates were always lower than 4 g cm 2 h 1 which may indicate an associated process derived from higher stomatal regulation and leaf and trunk water depletion in the control plot meijide et al 2017 therefore we did not confirm our initial hypothesis that hysteresis area would be largest for the control treatment as there was an opposite trend showing an increase in hysteresis area in both irrigation treatments when soil water supply was higher during the ds our findings suggest that the hysteresis effect cannot be explained solely by an increase in the resistance along the soil plant atmosphere continuum which is the argument used to explain the hysteresis effect in woody species o grady et al 1999 zeppel et al 2004 we suggest that the hysteresis effect in palm tree js might be attributed to an increase in stem refilling capacitance derived by water refilling during nighttime hours because of the irrigation yang et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 sperling et al 2014 in fact in our study the higher hysteresis resulted from an alleviation to the soil plant hydraulic constraints resulting in higher t in the morning than the afternoon vpd clockwise mainly in the irrigation treatment in fact about 60 of the fresh weight of palm leaves corresponds to water content stored in leaf parenchyma islam et al 2000 and the internal trunk water storage is considered an important water source to maintain higher stomatal conductance and gross primary productivity in palm oil plantations meijide et al 2017 the most interesting hpar pattern observed among seasons and among treatments was the butterfly hysteresis direction form fig 5 which was also described in an indonesian palm oil plantation in response to net radiation niu et al 2015 röll et al 2015 in the early morning to midday when the hpar was clockwise the hysteresis pattern was driven by an interaction between vpd and par however after a vpd threshold 1 kpa was reached the js rates started to decrease when par reached about 600 µmol m 2 s 1 almost half the maximum daily par fig 6 confirming that palm productivity is more limited by atmospheric water stress than light availability figs 6 and 7 and table 2 in fact earlier studies have shown reductions in stomatal conductance when vpd exceed 1 7 2 kpa even if soil moisture is plentiful smith 1989 henson 1991 dufrêne and saugier 1993 meijide et al 2017 indicating that the observed asymmetric shape of js in response to par might affect the diurnal cycle of palm carbon assimilation along the dry season due to limitations to photosynthesis induced by high vpd rates rees 1961 carr 2011 or to an enhanced respiration induced by higher temperature pingintha et al 2010 in addition our results highlight that the additional soil water supply from irrigation ameliorated this limitation indicating an efficient use of light in both irrigation treatments figs 6 and 7 the intercept of a linear regression between hpar and parmax was higher in the control plot than in both irrigation treatments fig s3 indicating that irrigation increases light use efficiency only during the early hours of the morning was js likely primarily driven by par during this period vpd was small 0 5 kpa and js was strongly correlated to par fig 5 in contrast during late afternoon after 4 p m the magnitude of js was relatively higher even with reduced par close to zero indicating that the js was primarily driven by changes in vpd during this period 5 conclusion in our study we provide the first measurements of water fluxes in amazonian oil palm plantations under an extreme drought induced by enso our study and results are unique because this experimental design increased the understanding of the associated effects of atmosphere and soil drought on palm water use our results support our initial hypothesis h1 showing that the control treatment plot presented a more conservative water use during the ds while drip irrigation plots had significantly higher transpiration rates however the water surplus by the sprinkler system guaranteed about 10 higher production during 2015 and 2016 this strongly suggests that both irrigation systems are sufficient to mitigate drought effects but in terms of total drupe yield the sprinkler irrigation system has a higher efficiency the results also supported h2 as there is a clear relationship between the environmental drivers par and vpd and oil palm transpiration at the leaf level as well as at the stand level across the weeks the vpd was more important to drive oil palm transpiration and par determining transpiration was more strongly affected by drought in fact palm trees conserve water under drought conditions and the upper leaves are more sensitive to vpd variation than older lower leaves lastly we demonstrated that hysteresis area was strongly determined by daily vpd intensity in all treatments h3 conversely we showed that hysteresis area in response to vpd and par was higher in both irrigation treatments in contrast to the control plot we suggest that the additional soil water supply provided by irrigation allowed for an increase in the internal water storage which allowed for higher oil palm water use in the morning our study highlights the sensitivity of oil palm trees to water stress with strong regulation of transpiration rates in the control plot but also indicates that additional water supply can mitigate this stress and increase their resilience to drought and potentially increase productivity during these periods the sprinkler system is recommended for increasing palm yield productivity but drip irrigation also mitigates drought stress and increases productivity in contrast to unirrigated controls authors contribution all

10274,water and nitrogen are two main factors affecting crop yield and quality and their optimization is crucial for sustainable agriculture production in this study the results of a three year 2017

quality irrigation was applied based on the cumulative evaporation epan measured with a standard 20 cm pan with its amounts set as 50 i1 70 i2 90 i3 of epan while the nitrogen rates were designed as 0 n0 150 n1 300 n2 and 450 n3 kg ha 1 averaging across nitrogen rates and years i2 decreased tomato yield and pfpn by 4 00 and 4 07 respectively when compared with i3 while significantly increased wp

fruit quality comprehensive appraisal method 1 introduction tomato which is rich in lycopene phenols carotenoids vitamin c and antioxidants toor et al 2006 favati et al 2009 liu et al 2019 is one of the widely consumed vegetables worldwide du et al 2017 lu et al 2019 china a leading tomato producing country products 6 82 of the world fao 2017 with the rapid economic development people s demand on high quality foods gets much higher chen et al 2013 however tomato fruit yield and quality are controlled not only by its genes but also by environmental factors such as soil moisture nutrients climatic conditions and agronomic measures dumas et al 2003 gautier et al 2008 kuscu et al 2014 water and nitrogen are considered to be the most important and manageable factors hence an effective water and nitrogen management strategy is essential to improve fruit quality crop water productivity wp and nitrogen use efficiency as well as maintain yield irrigation is thought to be one of the key factors affecting water and nutrient absorption of crops especially those greenhouse crops that are not supplied by rainfall excessive irrigation declined wp and fruit quality rostamza et al 2011 in contrast deficit irrigation can improve tomato fruit quality and wp mitchell and shennan 1991 patanè et al 2011 wang et al 2015 liu et al 2019 but reduce leaf number plant height and leaf area index nagaz et al 2009 wang et al 2017 moreover deficit irrigation also affects crop physiological processes soil nutrient mineralization and nutrient absorption processes eventually limiting crop growth and decreasing crop yield wang et al 2010 2012a 2012b the availability of nutrients is another factor affecting the yield and quality of crops besides water nitrogen is one of the most important nutrients for all crops suitable increase in nitrogen rate under drought stress could improve plant drought resistance waraich et al 2011 and mitigate the detrimental effects of drought stress on crop growth rostamza et al 2011 jalil et al 2019 however excessive nitrogen might cause nitrate leaching groundwater pollution and it also has detrimental effects on yield quality and nitrogen use efficiency min et al 2011 song et al 2009 zhang et al 2011a zhang et al 2011b sun et al 2013 previous studies showed that the optimal nitrogen rate for tomato varied with the experimental objectives and environmental factors when the aim was to maximize yield and wp the optimal nitrogen rate was 250 kg ha 1 whereas it was 150 kg n ha 1 when the goal was to maximize nitrogen use efficiency du et al 2017 badr et al 2016 suggested that tomato could obtain the highest yield and wp with 300 kg n ha 1 under three irrigation levels 50 70 and 100 of cumulative crop et whereas wang et al 2015 reported that tomato had the optimal fruit quality with 574 kg n ha 1 hence the nitrogen rate with the best comprehensive benefit needs further investigation soil water mediates transformations of plant nutrients and their uptake by roots qiu et al 2017 and fruit quality will be affected by water and nitrogen while fruit quality is a comprehensive concept representing the interactive quality

lycopene and vitamin c and storage characteristics fruit hardness and water content chittaranjan 2007 viskelis et al 2008 unfortunately there is no standardized protocol to quantify the comprehensive fruit quality recently various methods have been developed to comprehensively evaluate tomato fruit quality based on numerous quality indicators such as the principal component analysis pca hongzheng et al 2016 gray relational analysis gra wang et al 2015 analytic hierarchy process ahp wang et al 2011 and technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis wang et al 2011 luo and li 2018 liu et al 2019 however the aforementioned methods may produce inconsistent results furthermore measuring all quality indicators requires substantial time labor and equipment which is generally difficult for farmers to accept therefore an appropriate and simple method is needed to evaluate comprehensive fruit quality moreover it is necessary to find a simple indicator representing tomato comprehensive fruit quality in this study it was aimed to investigate the effects of different irrigation and nitrogen rates on yield wp pfpn and fruit quality of greenhouse grown tomato furthermore the suitable model was developed to evaluate comprehensive fruit quality and to identify a characteristic indicator that could represent comprehensive fruit quality eventually the optimal irrigation and nitrogen rate was investigated to trade off yield wp pfpn and fruit quality by using topsis 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the experiment was conducted from 2017 to 2019 in a greenhouse at the xinxiang agro ecological experimental station latitude 35 86 n longitude 113 68 e altitude 78 7 m chinese academy of agricultural sciences located in henan province of china the site has a warm temperate continental monsoon climate with long term annual mean air temperature of 14 1 c the mean annual precipitation was 548 3 mm while the mean annual evaporation was 1908 7 mm value of 20 cm evaporation pan the frost free period was 200 5 d with the mean annual sunshine of 2398 8 h the physical and chemical properties of 0 60 cm soil layer are presented in table 1 and electrical conductivity ec was obtained by 1 5 soil solution ratio the greenhouse was 60 m long 8 5 m wide with the soil surface 0 5 m below the ground surface the total area of cultivated cropland was 440 m2 east west orientation and the crop rows were in north south direction the greenhouse was covered with a polyethylene sheet to maintain the interior temperature at night the surface of the polyethylene sheet was covered with 2 5 cm thick cotton quilts during the initial experiment stage the air temperature and relative humidity during daytime were manually controlled by several vents located on the top and side of the polyethylene sheet and back wall impermeable film was embedded in the soil at a depth of 0 6 m between each plot to prevent lateral infiltration 2 2 experimental design and management the experiment consisted of four nitrogen rates main plots and three irrigation amounts subplots randomized within blocks each with three replications the four nitrogen rates were 0 150 300 and 450 kg n ha 1 designated as n0 n1 n2 and n3 respectively and the three irrigation amounts were 50 70 and 90 of the cumulative evaporation epan denoted as i1 i2 and i3 respectively the irrigation amounts were referred to epan measured by a 20 cm pan 0 20 m in diameter and 0 11 m in depth not a standard pan worldwide but recommended in china for measuring evaporation as a reference liu et al 2013 2019 gong et al 2020 the pan was placed 20 cm above the plant canopy and evaporation was measured daily at 7 00 a m using a glass graduated flask then the 20 cm pan was cleaned and refilled with 20 mm fresh water by using a glass graduated flask when epan reached 20 2 mm irrigation was applied for all treatments and the irrigation amounts were 50 70 and 90 of epan respectively all treatments received equal quantities of phosphorus and potassium in the forms of 120 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 300 kg k2o ha 1 respectively urea with 46 4 n ca h2po4 2 with 14 p2o5 and k2so4 with 50 k2o were applied to meet the nutrient requirements of the tomato plants before transplanting all of the p2o5 fertilizer and 40 of the n and k2so4 fertilizers were broadcasted over the soil surface as a base fertilizer prior to ploughing with a rotary spader to 16 cm deep the remaining 60 of the k2so4 and n fertilizers were dissolved by a drip irrigation system and fertigation was applied in four equal splits during the season from 2017 to 2019 when the first second third and fourth truss fruits began to expand the specific dates of different trusses fruits expanding were april 22 may 6 may 19 and june 3 in 2017 respectively those in 2018 were april 19 may 4 may 17 and june 1 and in 2019 were april 29 may 10 may 22 and june 2 respectively seedlings of tomato lycopersicon esculentum mill cv huofenghuang were transplanted into each plot 1 1 m in width 8 m in length on march 7 2017 march 4 2018 and march 21 2019 respectively the planting pattern was wide narrow row 0 65 m and 0 45 m with an intra row plant interval of 30 cm thus a planting density was 5 7 plants m 2 plastic drip irrigation strips 16 mm external diameter intra strip emitter at 30 cm distance delivering 1 1 l h 1 at operating pressure of 100 kpa were laid along each row of plants a valve integrated with a pressure gauge was installed in each plot to control the irrigation amount and regulate the water pressure a flowmeter was also installed in each plot to measure the irrigation volume just after transplanting drip irrigation of 20 mm was supplied only once for all treatments to ensure the tomato seedlings survival and the irrigation took about 3 h the irrigation treatments started when tomato fruits began setting april 21 in 2017 april 13 in 2018 and april 20 in 2019 and the irrigation amount was conducted according to epan irrigation was terminated one week before the end of the experiment the plants were pruned above the fourth truss leaving 3 4 leaves and the lateral branches were removed when they grew to 3 5 cm in length in order to increase the fruit setting rate the plants were sprayed with tomato tone dongshihaoxi weifang xiaolan biotechnology limited company china once weekly at the onset of the flowering period during seeding stage the vents were opened when the interior temperature was higher than 30 c after april if the lowest interior temperature stabilized above 15 c the vents were opened except on rainy days until the end of the experiment other agronomic practices such as weeding pest control and pollination were same for all treatments following the local agronomic practices harvesting started when 90 of the tomato fruits turned red and the first fruits were harvested on may 26 in 2017 may 17 in 2018 and may 31 in 2019 respectively thereafter each plot was harvested twice weekly 2 3 measurements and computational methods 2 3 1 soil moisture and crop evapotranspiration the gravimetric water content at 20 cm interval within 0 100 cm soil layer was measured from a site 15 cm away from a drip emitter in the intra row direction during the growing season ismail et al 2008 liu et al 2019 the crop evapotranspiration et mm was calculated using the following water balance equation allen et al 2011 1 et p i u d r w where p is the effective precipitation mm i is the irrigation amount mm u is the water movement from the deep soil into the root zone mm d is the deep percolation mm r is the surface runoff mm δw is the change in soil profile water content within the 0 100 cm soli layer mm and δw was calculated as follows 2 w 1000 h q t 2 q t 1 where h is the crop root depth m q t 1 and q t 2 are the average soil water content of the root zone at t 1 and t 2 respectively cm3 cm 3 the experiment was conducted in a greenhouse with drip irrigation on flat terrain and the irrigation amount was small hence p 0 d 0 and r 0 the groundwater table was below 5 0 m and the crop roots were unable to absorb and utilize the groundwater thus the underground water recharge was negligible u 0 accordingly eq 1 was simplified to 3 et i w 2 3 2 yield crop water productivity and nitrogen use efficiency twenty representative plants were sampled from each plot to calculate yield the red fruits free of pests and disease were weighed at mature stage using a 5 g electronic scale jc201 beijing china the yield of each plot was calculated separately crop water productivity wp

undamaged mature tomato fruits uniform in size and color were selected from each plot during harvesting stage to measure fruit quality the fruits were homogenized in a blender then the contents of total soluble solid tss soluble sugar ssc vitamin c vc organic acids oa were measured the sugar acid ratio sar was calculated by ssc and oa tss was measured using a handheld refractometer pr 32 α atago tokyo japan and the relative value of tss tssr was determined by dividing tss in each treatment by the tss in n0i3 treatment vc was determined based on the classical titration method using 2 6 dichlorophenol indophenols sodium salt solution liu et al 2019 ssc was measured using the anthrone colorimetric method wang et al 2011 liu et al 2013 oa was initially titrated with 0 1 mol l 1 naoh

evaluation method cem which is a collaborative evaluation of various analytical methods is widely adopted as a comprehensive method and its results are generally considered reasonably representative cem is performed in the following five steps 1 construction of the original matrix x x x ij n m x 11 x 12 x 21 x 22 x 1 m x 2 m x n 1 x n 2 x nm where x ij i 1 2 n j 1 2 m is the jth measurement vc tss ssc oa and sar from the ith treatment in this paper n 12 and m 5 2 normalization of the matrix in this study the normalization of matrix was unnecessary because the comprehensive quality indicators obtained by topsis gra and pca had the same quantitative levels 3 spearman correlation analysis was used to assess the correlation between the ranking of each quality indicator and the ranking of the comprehensive quality evaluation 4 the weight of each evaluation method was determined as follows w k ρ k j 1 m ρ j where ρ k is the sum of the spearman correlation coefficient of each evaluation method k 1 2 3 m and j 1 2 3 m 5 the combined evaluation value of q for each evaluation method was calculated as follows q j 1 m w j z ij where z ij is the comprehensive quality index value

out using the duncan s multiple range tests at 5 probability level topsis pca gra and cem were employed to evaluate the association between fruit quality indicators also topsis was employed to determine the optimal irrigation and nitrogen management strategy spearman and kendal correlation analysis and pca were solved using spss software topsis gra and cem were solved by microsoft excel 3 results 3 1 yield and et irrigation nitrogen rate and their interaction significantly affected tomato yield p 0 001 table 3 over the three years the highest average yield was 122 28 t ha 1 in n3i3 and the lowest was 89 11 t ha 1 in n3i1 fig 1 averaging across nitrogen rates and years i1 and i2 reduced yield by 12 69 and 4 00 respectively compared with i3 averaging across irrigation amounts and years tomato yield in n2 increased by 2 47 compared with n3 whereas n1 and n0 decreased yield by 1 16 and 8 33 respectively however there was no significant difference in yield between n1 and n3 irrigation and nitrogen rate had an interactive effect on yield table 3 under i2 and i3 the increase in nitrogen rate significantly improved yield however under i1 tomato yield significantly increased with increasing nitrogen rate no more than 300 kg ha 1 but then remarkably declined with further supply to 450 kg n ha 1 fig 1 compared with n3i1 89 11 t ha 1 over the three years the average yield in n0i1 96 41 t ha 1 n1i1 103 10 t ha 1 and n2i1 106 04 t ha 1 increased by 8 19 15 70 and 19 00 respectively irrigation significantly affected et in the three years whereas nitrogen rate had a significant influence on et in 2019 only the interaction between irrigation and nitrogen rate had a significant effect on et table 3 fig 2 at the same nitrogen rate et noticeably increased with increasing irrigation amount averaging across nitrogen rates and years et in i1 and i2 dramatically reduced by 22 22 and 10 87 respectively compared with i3 fig 2 table 2 averaging across irrigation amounts and years et initially increased and then decreased with increasing nitrogen rate the highest et was 261 42 mm in n2 but the differences in et between n1 n2 and n3 were insignificant table 3 et in 2017 and 2019 were higher than that in 2018 due to a decrease in evaporation as manifested by the cumulative evaporation measured from the 20 cm pan the cumulative evaporation measured in 2017 and 2019 increased by 18 42 and 29 37 respectively when compared with that in 2018 fig 2 3 2 wp and pfpn irrigation nitrogen rate and their interaction significantly affected wp table 3 under the same nitrogen rate except n3 wp significantly decreased with increasing irrigation amount in the three years the maximum average value of wp was 47 11 kg m 3 in n2i1 while the lowest was 36 14 kg m 3 in n0i3 over the three years fig 3 averaging across nitrogen rates and years wp increased by 12 43 and 7 67 in i1 44 21 kg m 3 and i2 42 34 kg m 3 compared with i3 39 32 kg m 3 respectively averaging across irrigation amounts and years wp first increased and then decreased with increasing nitrogen rate the highest value of wp was 43 53 kg m 3 in n2 while the lowest was 39 52 kg m 3 in n0 compared with n0 the wp in n1 42 22 kg m 3 n2 43 53 kg m 3 and n3 42 56 kg m 3 increased by 6 82 10 14 and 7 70 respectively but the difference in wp between n1 and n3 was not significant table 3 pfpn was noticeably affected by irrigation and nitrogen rate but not dynamically affected by their interaction except in 2019 fig 4 table 3 in the three years pfpn significantly increased with increasing irrigation amount averaging across nitrogen rates and years pfpn in i1 412 95 kg kg 1 and i2 448 12 kg kg 1 noticeably decreased by 11 65 and 4 07 respectively when compared with i3 467 13 kg kg 1 pfpn dramatically increased with decreasing nitrogen rate averaging across irrigation amounts and years pfpn in n1 715 77 kg kg 1 and n2 371 03 kg kg 1 significantly increased by 196 51 and 53 70 respectively when compared with n3 241 40 kg kg 1 table 3 3 3 fruit quality the effects of irrigation and nitrogen rate on fruit quality indicator are shown in table 4 irrigation amount significantly p 0 01 affected all fruit quality indicators except sar and nitrogen rate significantly p 0 05 affected all fruit quality indicators except sar in 2017 and 2018 the interaction between irrigation and nitrogen rate significantly affected oa in 2018 and 2019 over the three years tomato fruit had the highest average values of vc sar and ssc 173 33 mg kg 1 7 07 and 2 91 respectively in n2i1 and the highest average values of tss 5 10 and oa 0 44 in n3i1 n0i3 presented the lowest average values of vc 129 48 mg kg 1 tss 4 03 oa 0 32 and ssc 2 00 and n0i0 presented the lowest average value of sar 5 99 averaging across nitrogen rates and years i1 significantly increased the contents of the vc tss ssc and oa by 14 68 10 86 17 51 and 16 69 respectively and those in i2 significantly increased by 8 64 5 42 7 15 and 7 15 respectively when compared with i3 averaging across irrigation amounts and years the contents of vc sar and ssc first increased and then decreased with increasing nitrogen rates with the highest contents 164 15 mg kg 1 7 02 and 2 67 respectively in n2 the contents of tss and oa significantly increased with increasing nitrogen rate no more than 300 kg ha 1 but the increase was comparatively lower with further supply to 450 kg n ha 1 compared with n3 the contents of vc 153 19 mg kg 1 tss 4 57 oa 0 36 and ssc 2 39 in n1 decreased by 2 46 5 51 9 75 and 6 21 respectively 3 4 comprehensive fruit quality the comprehensive fruit quality scores in 2019 calculated by topsis gra and pca are shown in table 5 topsis indicated that n2i2 0 7613 and n2i1 0 7424 ranked first and second respectively while n0i3 0 3356 ranked the last gra showed that n2i1 0 8812 and n3i1 0 8782 ranked first and second respectively whereas n0i3 0 4117 ranked the last pca revealed that n2i1 0 9200 and n1i1 0 8440 ranked first and second respectively while n0i3 0 1307 ranked the last although there were certain inconsistencies among the rankings estimated by various analytical methods the average kendall correlation coefficients for pca topsis and gra were 0 8839 0 7829 and 0 8687 respectively over the three years table 6 therefore it was feasible to construct a combination model cem based on topsis gra and pca in the analysis the average spearman correlation coefficients between the cem and pca gra and topsis were determined as 0 9953 0 9860 and 0 9301 respectively table 7 furthermore the comprehensive fruit quality scores obtained by pca gra and cem were almost consistent indicating that pca and gra might be suitable models to evaluate comprehensive fruit quality pca and gra revealed that n2i1 had the highest score providing the optimal comprehensive fruit quality in addition we also detected a significant positive correlation between tssr and the comprehensive quality score fig 5 in the three years indicating that tss could be used as an ideal index representing tomato comprehensive fruit quality 3 5 trading off yield wp pfpn and fruit quality although we suggested that tss could represent the comprehensive fruit quality the determination of optimal irrigation and nitrogen rate should not only consider quality but also yield wp and pfpn the results of the ranking scores by topsis for all treatments are shown in table 8 the ranking scores of each year indicated that the n1i2 with qi values of 0 86 0 86 and 0 80 in 2017 2018 and 2019 respectively was the optimal irrigation and nitrogen management strategy for tomato production when averaged over the three years n1i2 had the highest qi value 0 84 which can best trade off tomato yield wp pfpn and fruit quality 4 discussion 4 1 effects of irrigation and nitrogen rate on yield tomato is a characteristically water demanding crop earlier studies reported that deficit irrigation significantly decreased yield jensen et al 2010 chen et al 2014 which is consistent with our study tomato is sensitive to water stress especially during the flowering and fruit setting stage nuruddin et al 2003 chen et al 2013 water deficit at these stages decreased fruit number and weight liu et al 2013 2019 consequently lowering the yield in addition deficit irrigation caused plasma membrane damage stomatal closure leaf damage and low photosynthetic capacity which resulted in a reduction in yield topcu et al 2007 patanè et al 2011 talbi et al 2015 tomato yield significantly increased with increasing nitrogen rate no more than 300 kg ha 1 because an increase in nitrogen rate enhanced the physiological growth of the crop and increased its absorption of water and nutrients drenovsky et al 2012 however yield significantly declined with further supply to 450 kg n ha 1 table 3 as the lowest yield 89 11 t ha 1 in n3i1 fig 1 under water stress condition i1 excessive nitrogen rate significantly decreased yield and this could be due to an increase in osmotic pressure of rhizosphere gonzalez dugo et al 2011 thus plants would need to acquire more energy to maintain cell water contents thereby reducing the transpiration and nutrient absorption capacities lahoz et al 2016 jalil et al 2019 which would eventually cause a significant reduction in yield fig 1 4 2 effects of irrigation and nitrogen rate on wp and pfpn our results showed that irrigation and nitrogen rate dynamically affected wp table 3 under severe water stress i1 the appropriate increase in nitrogen rate no more than 300 kg n ha 1 significantly enhanced wp fig 3 which was mainly due to the significant increase in yield but no significant decrease in et fig 1 and fig 2 however excessive nitrogen rate 450 kg ha 1 reduced wp owing to the remarkable reduction in yield in n3i1 fig 1 however under i2 and i3 wp asymptotically increased with increasing nitrogen rate no more than 300 kg ha 1 fig 3 owing to the similar response of the yield to nitrogen rate fig 1 but without significant change in et fig 2 at the same nitrogen rate except n3 wp significantly decreased with increasing irrigation amount which is consistent with kiymaz and ertek 2015 however when nitrogen rate was 450 kg ha 1 n3 wp increased first and then decreased with increasing irrigation amount under n3 the maximum wp was not associated with the minimum irrigation amount because the increase in water stress suppressed nutrient absorption and plant growth talbi et al 2015 which significantly reduced fruit yield fig 1 this was consistent with previous studies on tomato potato and eggplant kang et al 2004 ertek et al 2006 cantore et al 2016 similarly the minimum wp was not associated with the maximum irrigation amount in n3 because excessive irrigation with high nitrogen rate leads to vigorous plant growth and elevates rates of non productive transpiration fig 2 hence an increase in irrigation amount benefits yield but not wp under excessive nitrogen rate cantore et al 2016 wang et al 2017 pfpn is a common index used to represent nitrogen use efficiency peng et al 2002 wang et al 2017 jalil et al 2019 nafi et al 2019 our results showed that excessive nitrogen rate significantly reduced pfpn fig 4 and table 2 because it exceeded the optimal demands of tomato plants excessive nitrogen rate lead to inefficient nitrogen utilization and consequent nitrogen leaching and volatilization ju et al 2009 li et al 2017 eventually tomato yield remarkably decreased table 3 in contrast appropriate nitrogen rate have been shown to improve pfpn and yield and reduce the soil nitrate loss spiertz 2010 in our study pfpn increased with increasing irrigation amount mainly because yield significantly increased with increasing irrigation amounts under the same planting and nutrient conditions fig 1 4 3 effects of irrigation and nitrogen rate on fruit quality indicators our results showed that deficit irrigation markedly improved tss ssc vc and oa table 4 which agreed with previous studies patanè and cosentino 2010 chen et al 2014 liu et al 2019 water stress prevented the translocation of the phloem sap to the fruit causing a reduction in water accumulation and a relative increase in solute concentrations within the fruits mitchell and shennan 1991 guichard et al 2008 therefore the fruit water content declined but the accumulation of sugars and acids were virtually unaffected mitchell and shennan 1991 chen et al 2014 in addition water stress may also decrease the leaf area index resulting in an increase in the intensity and duration of the absorbed solar radiation which is beneficial to the accumulation of sugar and vc dumas et al 2003 fruit taste is largely determined by the contents of ssc oa as well as their ratio water deficit markedly increased the ssc and oa however there was only a slight increase in sar over the three years due to the consistent responses of ssc and oa to deficit irrigation table 4 tss an important tomato fruit quality indicator is the general term used to describe the soluble solids in tomato fruit pulp which includes about 65 sugar sucrose and hexose 13 organic acids citric acid and malate and 12 other minor components phenol amino acids soluble pectin ascorbic acid and minerals chen et al 2014 in our study ssc and oa accounted for 53 and 8 of the tss table 4 respectively alluding to the fact that decreasing irrigation amount might have boosted the production of tss the contents of ssc oa vc tss and sar significantly increased with increasing nitrogen rate no more than 300 kg ha 1 because the suitable nitrogen rate considerably improved n uptake which in turn would contribute to enhance the photosynthetic activity as well as the protein synthesis hoffmann 2005 rostamza et al 2011 however when nitrogen rate increased to 450 kg ha 1 the contents of ssc and vc decreased and the content of oa increased because excessive nitrogen rate impeded the nutrient absorption by tomato fruit li et al 2019 but improved the synthesis of amino acids and proteins from the nitrogen and organic acids consequently the demand for organic acids converted from sugars increased thereby augmenting sugar consumption and diminishing sugar accumulation sun et al 2011 besides the excessive nitrogen rate could promote crop growth broaden shade area and reduce temperature which ultimately induce acid synthesis benard et al 2009 therefore the excessive nitrogen rate decreased ssc but increased oa table 4 sugar is the raw material for vc synthesis hence a reduction in ssc may inhibit vc synthesis which is consistent with the findings of previous studies kuscu et al 2014 wang et al 2017 the highest sar was not measured at the highest nitrogen rate in the present study as the excessive nitrogen rate impeded the ssc production while facilitated oa synthesis table 4 as ssc and oa are the main components of tss liu et al 2019 and the excessive nitrogen rate reduced the ssc but improved the oa therefore there was no significant increase in tss when the nitrogen rate increased from 300 kg ha 1 to 450 kg ha 1 table 4 4 4 the evaluation and simplification of comprehensive fruit quality although there are numerous quality indicators which are generally difficult to quantify they are still important for determining the optimal irrigation and nitrogen management strategy for tomato production however some of quality indicators responded inconsistently to irrigation and nitrogen rates for example we found that deficit irrigation significantly improved tss whereas sar was independent of irrigation amount it was also found that tss and sar peaked at nitrogen rates of 450 kg ha 1 and 300 kg ha 1 respectively table 4 these findings confirmed our conviction that it was essential to establish a fruit quality index that could comprehensively reflect tomato fruit quality gra pca and topsis were considered as ideal methods to evaluate tomato comprehensive fruit quality wang et al 2015 luo and li 2018 liu et al 2019 however the results obtained by foregoing evaluation methods were inconsistent wang et al 2015 which is consistent with our results table 5 therefore we proposed a combination evaluation method cem based on pca topsis and gra however we identified a positive correlation relationship between cem and pca or gra the average spearman correlation coefficients over the three years were 0 9953 and 0 9860 respectively table 7 suggesting that pca and gra might be suitable models to evaluate tomato comprehensive fruit quality which is consistent with the previous study wang et al 2015 fruit quality comprises many attributes whose measurement are generally costly and complex however tomato quality was characterized reasonably well by tss ssc vc and oa causse et al 2003 stevens et al 2007 shi et al 2015 liu et al 2019 among these indicators the relative value of tss was highly positively correlated with the comprehensive fruit quality score calculated by pca and gra in the three years fig 5 moreover measuring tss is relatively cheap convenient rapid and accurate hence we propose that tss could be used as an index representing comprehensive fruit quality 4 5 the optimal irrigation and nitrogen management strategy optimal irrigation and nitrogen management strategy should trade off the relationships among yield wp nitrogen use efficiency pfpn and fruit quality in this study the full irrigation i3 improved yield and pfpn fig 1 and fig 4 but reduced fruit quality and wp fig 3 and table 4 the proper nitrogen rate 300 kg n ha 1 improved yield wp and fruit quality table 3 and table 4 but significantly reduced pfpn fig 4 and table 3 as the influences of irrigation and nitrogen rates on yield wp pfpn and fruit quality are complex the interactive influences cannot be revealed by qualitative analysis alone therefore it is imperative to develop the relationships among yield wp pfpn and fruit quality in response to different irrigation and nitrogen rates by using comprehensive analyses the results showed that topsis was capable of estimating optimal irrigation and nitrogen rates by best trading off yield wp pfpn and fruit quality in greenhouse grown tomato in our experiment topsis revealed that the n1i2 treatment ranked the first table 8 therefore the combined i2 70 of epan and n1 150 kg n ha 1 would be an optimal irrigation and nitrogen management strategy for tomato production in greenhouse 5 conclusions the moderate deficit irrigation i2 significantly improved fruit quality and crop water productivity wp but slightly decreased yield and nitrogen use efficiency pfpn of tomato the excessive nitrogen rate above 300 kg ha 1 did not increase yield fruit quality except organic acid and total soluble solid wp and pfpn principal component analysis pca and gray relational analysis gra were the suitable models for evaluating tomato comprehensive fruit quality the relative value of total soluble solid tssr had a significantly positive relationship with the comprehensive fruit quality score suggesting that tss could be used as a proxy presenting tomato comprehensive fruit quality analysis of all experimental data using topsis showed that n1i2 nitrogen rate 150 kg ha 1 irrigation amount 70 of epan gave the best results and it was the optimal irrigation and nitrogen management strategy for greenhouse tomato to best trade off yield wp pfpn and fruit quality declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

10274,water and nitrogen are two main factors affecting crop yield and quality and their optimization is crucial for sustainable agriculture production in this study the results of a three year 2017 2019 experiment were presented to reveal the effects of irrigation and nitrogen rate on yield crop water productivity wp nitrogen use efficiency partial factor productivity nitrogen pfpn and fruit quality irrigation was applied based on the cumulative evaporation epan measured with a standard 20 cm pan with its amounts set as 50 i1 70 i2 90 i3 of epan while the nitrogen rates were designed as 0 n0 150 n1 300 n2 and 450 n3 kg ha 1 averaging across nitrogen rates and years i2 decreased tomato yield and pfpn by 4 00 and 4 07 respectively when compared with i3 while significantly increased wp vitamin c vc total soluble solid tss soluble sugar content ssc and organic acids oa by 7 68 8 64 5 42 7 15 and 7 15 respectively averaging across irrigation amounts and years applying nitrogen rates more than 300 kg ha 1 not only failed to increase yield but also reduced wp vc ssc sugar acid ratio sar and pfpn compared with n2 the yield wp and fruit quality decreased slightly in n1 whereas the nitrogen rate decreased by 50 both the principal component analysis and gray relational analysis were identified as suitable models for assessing comprehensive fruit quality the relative value of tss had a highly positive relationship with comprehensive quality score indicating that tss could be used as an index representing comprehensive fruit quality topsis technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution revealed that n1i2 was the optimal irrigation and nitrogen rate for greenhouse grown tomato keywords lycopersicon esculentum mill water and nitrogen yield comprehensive fruit quality comprehensive appraisal method 1 introduction tomato which is rich in lycopene phenols carotenoids vitamin c and antioxidants toor et al 2006 favati et al 2009 liu et al 2019 is one of the widely consumed vegetables worldwide du et al 2017 lu et al 2019 china a leading tomato producing country products 6 82 of the world fao 2017 with the rapid economic development people s demand on high quality foods gets much higher chen et al 2013 however tomato fruit yield and quality are controlled not only by its genes but also by environmental factors such as soil moisture nutrients climatic conditions and agronomic measures dumas et al 2003 gautier et al 2008 kuscu et al 2014 water and nitrogen are considered to be the most important and manageable factors hence an effective water and nitrogen management strategy is essential to improve fruit quality crop water productivity wp and nitrogen use efficiency as well as maintain yield irrigation is thought to be one of the key factors affecting water and nutrient absorption of crops especially those greenhouse crops that are not supplied by rainfall excessive irrigation declined wp and fruit quality rostamza et al 2011 in contrast deficit irrigation can improve tomato fruit quality and wp mitchell and shennan 1991 patanè et al 2011 wang et al 2015 liu et al 2019 but reduce leaf number plant height and leaf area index nagaz et al 2009 wang et al 2017 moreover deficit irrigation also affects crop physiological processes soil nutrient mineralization and nutrient absorption processes eventually limiting crop growth and decreasing crop yield wang et al 2010 2012a 2012b the availability of nutrients is another factor affecting the yield and quality of crops besides water nitrogen is one of the most important nutrients for all crops suitable increase in nitrogen rate under drought stress could improve plant drought resistance waraich et al 2011 and mitigate the detrimental effects of drought stress on crop growth rostamza et al 2011 jalil et al 2019 however excessive nitrogen might cause nitrate leaching groundwater pollution and it also has detrimental effects on yield quality and nitrogen use efficiency min et al 2011 song et al 2009 zhang et al 2011a zhang et al 2011b sun et al 2013 previous studies showed that the optimal nitrogen rate for tomato varied with the experimental objectives and environmental factors when the aim was to maximize yield and wp the optimal nitrogen rate was 250 kg ha 1 whereas it was 150 kg n ha 1 when the goal was to maximize nitrogen use efficiency du et al 2017 badr et al 2016 suggested that tomato could obtain the highest yield and wp with 300 kg n ha 1 under three irrigation levels 50 70 and 100 of cumulative crop et whereas wang et al 2015 reported that tomato had the optimal fruit quality with 574 kg n ha 1 hence the nitrogen rate with the best comprehensive benefit needs further investigation soil water mediates transformations of plant nutrients and their uptake by roots qiu et al 2017 and fruit quality will be affected by water and nitrogen while fruit quality is a comprehensive concept representing the interactive quality indicators between individuals which not only includes appearance size uniformity shape and color and taste total soluble solids soluble sugar and organic acid but also nutritional contents e g lycopene and vitamin c and storage characteristics fruit hardness and water content chittaranjan 2007 viskelis et al 2008 unfortunately there is no standardized protocol to quantify the comprehensive fruit quality recently various methods have been developed to comprehensively evaluate tomato fruit quality based on numerous quality indicators such as the principal component analysis pca hongzheng et al 2016 gray relational analysis gra wang et al 2015 analytic hierarchy process ahp wang et al 2011 and technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis wang et al 2011 luo and li 2018 liu et al 2019 however the aforementioned methods may produce inconsistent results furthermore measuring all quality indicators requires substantial time labor and equipment which is generally difficult for farmers to accept therefore an appropriate and simple method is needed to evaluate comprehensive fruit quality moreover it is necessary to find a simple indicator representing tomato comprehensive fruit quality in this study it was aimed to investigate the effects of different irrigation and nitrogen rates on yield wp pfpn and fruit quality of greenhouse grown tomato furthermore the suitable model was developed to evaluate comprehensive fruit quality and to identify a characteristic indicator that could represent comprehensive fruit quality eventually the optimal irrigation and nitrogen rate was investigated to trade off yield wp pfpn and fruit quality by using topsis 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the experiment was conducted from 2017 to 2019 in a greenhouse at the xinxiang agro ecological experimental station latitude 35 86 n longitude 113 68 e altitude 78 7 m chinese academy of agricultural sciences located in henan province of china the site has a warm temperate continental monsoon climate with long term annual mean air temperature of 14 1 c the mean annual precipitation was 548 3 mm while the mean annual evaporation was 1908 7 mm value of 20 cm evaporation pan the frost free period was 200 5 d with the mean annual sunshine of 2398 8 h the physical and chemical properties of 0 60 cm soil layer are presented in table 1 and electrical conductivity ec was obtained by 1 5 soil solution ratio the greenhouse was 60 m long 8 5 m wide with the soil surface 0 5 m below the ground surface the total area of cultivated cropland was 440 m2 east west orientation and the crop rows were in north south direction the greenhouse was covered with a polyethylene sheet to maintain the interior temperature at night the surface of the polyethylene sheet was covered with 2 5 cm thick cotton quilts during the initial experiment stage the air temperature and relative humidity during daytime were manually controlled by several vents located on the top and side of the polyethylene sheet and back wall impermeable film was embedded in the soil at a depth of 0 6 m between each plot to prevent lateral infiltration 2 2 experimental design and management the experiment consisted of four nitrogen rates main plots and three irrigation amounts subplots randomized within blocks each with three replications the four nitrogen rates were 0 150 300 and 450 kg n ha 1 designated as n0 n1 n2 and n3 respectively and the three irrigation amounts were 50 70 and 90 of the cumulative evaporation epan denoted as i1 i2 and i3 respectively the irrigation amounts were referred to epan measured by a 20 cm pan 0 20 m in diameter and 0 11 m in depth not a standard pan worldwide but recommended in china for measuring evaporation as a reference liu et al 2013 2019 gong et al 2020 the pan was placed 20 cm above the plant canopy and evaporation was measured daily at 7 00 a m using a glass graduated flask then the 20 cm pan was cleaned and refilled with 20 mm fresh water by using a glass graduated flask when epan reached 20 2 mm irrigation was applied for all treatments and the irrigation amounts were 50 70 and 90 of epan respectively all treatments received equal quantities of phosphorus and potassium in the forms of 120 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 300 kg k2o ha 1 respectively urea with 46 4 n ca h2po4 2 with 14 p2o5 and k2so4 with 50 k2o were applied to meet the nutrient requirements of the tomato plants before transplanting all of the p2o5 fertilizer and 40 of the n and k2so4 fertilizers were broadcasted over the soil surface as a base fertilizer prior to ploughing with a rotary spader to 16 cm deep the remaining 60 of the k2so4 and n fertilizers were dissolved by a drip irrigation system and fertigation was applied in four equal splits during the season from 2017 to 2019 when the first second third and fourth truss fruits began to expand the specific dates of different trusses fruits expanding were april 22 may 6 may 19 and june 3 in 2017 respectively those in 2018 were april 19 may 4 may 17 and june 1 and in 2019 were april 29 may 10 may 22 and june 2 respectively seedlings of tomato lycopersicon esculentum mill cv huofenghuang were transplanted into each plot 1 1 m in width 8 m in length on march 7 2017 march 4 2018 and march 21 2019 respectively the planting pattern was wide narrow row 0 65 m and 0 45 m with an intra row plant interval of 30 cm thus a planting density was 5 7 plants m 2 plastic drip irrigation strips 16 mm external diameter intra strip emitter at 30 cm distance delivering 1 1 l h 1 at operating pressure of 100 kpa were laid along each row of plants a valve integrated with a pressure gauge was installed in each plot to control the irrigation amount and regulate the water pressure a flowmeter was also installed in each plot to measure the irrigation volume just after transplanting drip irrigation of 20 mm was supplied only once for all treatments to ensure the tomato seedlings survival and the irrigation took about 3 h the irrigation treatments started when tomato fruits began setting april 21 in 2017 april 13 in 2018 and april 20 in 2019 and the irrigation amount was conducted according to epan irrigation was terminated one week before the end of the experiment the plants were pruned above the fourth truss leaving 3 4 leaves and the lateral branches were removed when they grew to 3 5 cm in length in order to increase the fruit setting rate the plants were sprayed with tomato tone dongshihaoxi weifang xiaolan biotechnology limited company china once weekly at the onset of the flowering period during seeding stage the vents were opened when the interior temperature was higher than 30 c after april if the lowest interior temperature stabilized above 15 c the vents were opened except on rainy days until the end of the experiment other agronomic practices such as weeding pest control and pollination were same for all treatments following the local agronomic practices harvesting started when 90 of the tomato fruits turned red and the first fruits were harvested on may 26 in 2017 may 17 in 2018 and may 31 in 2019 respectively thereafter each plot was harvested twice weekly 2 3 measurements and computational methods 2 3 1 soil moisture and crop evapotranspiration the gravimetric water content at 20 cm interval within 0 100 cm soil layer was measured from a site 15 cm away from a drip emitter in the intra row direction during the growing season ismail et al 2008 liu et al 2019 the crop evapotranspiration et mm was calculated using the following water balance equation allen et al 2011 1 et p i u d r w where p is the effective precipitation mm i is the irrigation amount mm u is the water movement from the deep soil into the root zone mm d is the deep percolation mm r is the surface runoff mm δw is the change in soil profile water content within the 0 100 cm soli layer mm and δw was calculated as follows 2 w 1000 h q t 2 q t 1 where h is the crop root depth m q t 1 and q t 2 are the average soil water content of the root zone at t 1 and t 2 respectively cm3 cm 3 the experiment was conducted in a greenhouse with drip irrigation on flat terrain and the irrigation amount was small hence p 0 d 0 and r 0 the groundwater table was below 5 0 m and the crop roots were unable to absorb and utilize the groundwater thus the underground water recharge was negligible u 0 accordingly eq 1 was simplified to 3 et i w 2 3 2 yield crop water productivity and nitrogen use efficiency twenty representative plants were sampled from each plot to calculate yield the red fruits free of pests and disease were weighed at mature stage using a 5 g electronic scale jc201 beijing china the yield of each plot was calculated separately crop water productivity wp kg m 3 was calculated as follows fernández et al 2020 4 w p y a et 100 where y a is the total fruit economical yield t ha 1 nitrogen use efficiency was expressed in terms of the partial factor productivity nitrogen pfpn kg kg 1 nfr which was calculated as follows li et al 2017 wang et al 2017 nafi et al 2019 5 pfp n y a nfr where nfr is the nitrogen rate kg ha 1 2 3 3 fruit quality nine undamaged mature tomato fruits uniform in size and color were selected from each plot during harvesting stage to measure fruit quality the fruits were homogenized in a blender then the contents of total soluble solid tss soluble sugar ssc vitamin c vc organic acids oa were measured the sugar acid ratio sar was calculated by ssc and oa tss was measured using a handheld refractometer pr 32 α atago tokyo japan and the relative value of tss tssr was determined by dividing tss in each treatment by the tss in n0i3 treatment vc was determined based on the classical titration method using 2 6 dichlorophenol indophenols sodium salt solution liu et al 2019 ssc was measured using the anthrone colorimetric method wang et al 2011 liu et al 2013 oa was initially titrated with 0 1 mol l 1 naoh first and then calculated as the equivalence of citric acid expressed as the percentage of fresh mass wang et al 2017 2 4 methods for evaluating tomato comprehensive fruit quality gra wang et al 2015 xiao et al 2012 pca el bendary et al 2015 wang et al 2015 luo and li 2018 liu et al 2019 and topsis luo and li 2018 liu et al 2019 were used to evaluate comprehensive fruit quality the combinational evaluation method cem which is a collaborative evaluation of various analytical methods is widely adopted as a comprehensive method and its results are generally considered reasonably representative cem is performed in the following five steps 1 construction of the original matrix x x x ij n m x 11 x 12 x 21 x 22 x 1 m x 2 m x n 1 x n 2 x nm where x ij i 1 2 n j 1 2 m is the jth measurement vc tss ssc oa and sar from the ith treatment in this paper n 12 and m 5 2 normalization of the matrix in this study the normalization of matrix was unnecessary because the comprehensive quality indicators obtained by topsis gra and pca had the same quantitative levels 3 spearman correlation analysis was used to assess the correlation between the ranking of each quality indicator and the ranking of the comprehensive quality evaluation 4 the weight of each evaluation method was determined as follows w k ρ k j 1 m ρ j where ρ k is the sum of the spearman correlation coefficient of each evaluation method k 1 2 3 m and j 1 2 3 m 5 the combined evaluation value of q for each evaluation method was calculated as follows q j 1 m w j z ij where z ij is the comprehensive quality index value of tomato as determined by topsis gra and pca 2 5 data analysis the data were subjected to the analysis of variance anova appropriate to the experimental design to evaluate the effects of treatments on yield wp pfpn and fruit quality the glm procedure in spss version 21 0 ibm corp armonk ny was used to conduct the analysis of variance for three year data comparison of treatment means was carried out using the duncan s multiple range tests at 5 probability level topsis pca gra and cem were employed to evaluate the association between fruit quality indicators also topsis was employed to determine the optimal irrigation and nitrogen management strategy spearman and kendal correlation analysis and pca were solved using spss software topsis gra and cem were solved by microsoft excel 3 results 3 1 yield and et irrigation nitrogen rate and their interaction significantly affected tomato yield p 0 001 table 3 over the three years the highest average yield was 122 28 t ha 1 in n3i3 and the lowest was 89 11 t ha 1 in n3i1 fig 1 averaging across nitrogen rates and years i1 and i2 reduced yield by 12 69 and 4 00 respectively compared with i3 averaging across irrigation amounts and years tomato yield in n2 increased by 2 47 compared with n3 whereas n1 and n0 decreased yield by 1 16 and 8 33 respectively however there was no significant difference in yield between n1 and n3 irrigation and nitrogen rate had an interactive effect on yield table 3 under i2 and i3 the increase in nitrogen rate significantly improved yield however under i1 tomato yield significantly increased with increasing nitrogen rate no more than 300 kg ha 1 but then remarkably declined with further supply to 450 kg n ha 1 fig 1 compared with n3i1 89 11 t ha 1 over the three years the average yield in n0i1 96 41 t ha 1 n1i1 103 10 t ha 1 and n2i1 106 04 t ha 1 increased by 8 19 15 70 and 19 00 respectively irrigation significantly affected et in the three years whereas nitrogen rate had a significant influence on et in 2019 only the interaction between irrigation and nitrogen rate had a significant effect on et table 3 fig 2 at the same nitrogen rate et noticeably increased with increasing irrigation amount averaging across nitrogen rates and years et in i1 and i2 dramatically reduced by 22 22 and 10 87 respectively compared with i3 fig 2 table 2 averaging across irrigation amounts and years et initially increased and then decreased with increasing nitrogen rate the highest et was 261 42 mm in n2 but the differences in et between n1 n2 and n3 were insignificant table 3 et in 2017 and 2019 were higher than that in 2018 due to a decrease in evaporation as manifested by the cumulative evaporation measured from the 20 cm pan the cumulative evaporation measured in 2017 and 2019 increased by 18 42 and 29 37 respectively when compared with that in 2018 fig 2 3 2 wp and pfpn irrigation nitrogen rate and their interaction significantly affected wp table 3 under the same nitrogen rate except n3 wp significantly decreased with increasing irrigation amount in the three years the maximum average value of wp was 47 11 kg m 3 in n2i1 while the lowest was 36 14 kg m 3 in n0i3 over the three years fig 3 averaging across nitrogen rates and years wp increased by 12 43 and 7 67 in i1 44 21 kg m 3 and i2 42 34 kg m 3 compared with i3 39 32 kg m 3 respectively averaging across irrigation amounts and years wp first increased and then decreased with increasing nitrogen rate the highest value of wp was 43 53 kg m 3 in n2 while the lowest was 39 52 kg m 3 in n0 compared with n0 the wp in n1 42 22 kg m 3 n2 43 53 kg m 3 and n3 42 56 kg m 3 increased by 6 82 10 14 and 7 70 respectively but the difference in wp between n1 and n3 was not significant table 3 pfpn was noticeably affected by irrigation and nitrogen rate but not dynamically affected by their interaction except in 2019 fig 4 table 3 in the three years pfpn significantly increased with increasing irrigation amount averaging across nitrogen rates and years pfpn in i1 412 95 kg kg 1 and i2 448 12 kg kg 1 noticeably decreased by 11 65 and 4 07 respectively when compared with i3 467 13 kg kg 1 pfpn dramatically increased with decreasing nitrogen rate averaging across irrigation amounts and years pfpn in n1 715 77 kg kg 1 and n2 371 03 kg kg 1 significantly increased by 196 51 and 53 70 respectively when compared with n3 241 40 kg kg 1 table 3 3 3 fruit quality the effects of irrigation and nitrogen rate on fruit quality indicator are shown in table 4 irrigation amount significantly p 0 01 affected all fruit quality indicators except sar and nitrogen rate significantly p 0 05 affected all fruit quality indicators except sar in 2017 and 2018 the interaction between irrigation and nitrogen rate significantly affected oa in 2018 and 2019 over the three years tomato fruit had the highest average values of vc sar and ssc 173 33 mg kg 1 7 07 and 2 91 respectively in n2i1 and the highest average values of tss 5 10 and oa 0 44 in n3i1 n0i3 presented the lowest average values of vc 129 48 mg kg 1 tss 4 03 oa 0 32 and ssc 2 00 and n0i0 presented the lowest average value of sar 5 99 averaging across nitrogen rates and years i1 significantly increased the contents of the vc tss ssc and oa by 14 68 10 86 17 51 and 16 69 respectively and those in i2 significantly increased by 8 64 5 42 7 15 and 7 15 respectively when compared with i3 averaging across irrigation amounts and years the contents of vc sar and ssc first increased and then decreased with increasing nitrogen rates with the highest contents 164 15 mg kg 1 7 02 and 2 67 respectively in n2 the contents of tss and oa significantly increased with increasing nitrogen rate no more than 300 kg ha 1 but the increase was comparatively lower with further supply to 450 kg n ha 1 compared with n3 the contents of vc 153 19 mg kg 1 tss 4 57 oa 0 36 and ssc 2 39 in n1 decreased by 2 46 5 51 9 75 and 6 21 respectively 3 4 comprehensive fruit quality the comprehensive fruit quality scores in 2019 calculated by topsis gra and pca are shown in table 5 topsis indicated that n2i2 0 7613 and n2i1 0 7424 ranked first and second respectively while n0i3 0 3356 ranked the last gra showed that n2i1 0 8812 and n3i1 0 8782 ranked first and second respectively whereas n0i3 0 4117 ranked the last pca revealed that n2i1 0 9200 and n1i1 0 8440 ranked first and second respectively while n0i3 0 1307 ranked the last although there were certain inconsistencies among the rankings estimated by various analytical methods the average kendall correlation coefficients for pca topsis and gra were 0 8839 0 7829 and 0 8687 respectively over the three years table 6 therefore it was feasible to construct a combination model cem based on topsis gra and pca in the analysis the average spearman correlation coefficients between the cem and pca gra and topsis were determined as 0 9953 0 9860 and 0 9301 respectively table 7 furthermore the comprehensive fruit quality scores obtained by pca gra and cem were almost consistent indicating that pca and gra might be suitable models to evaluate comprehensive fruit quality pca and gra revealed that n2i1 had the highest score providing the optimal comprehensive fruit quality in addition we also detected a significant positive correlation between tssr and the comprehensive quality score fig 5 in the three years indicating that tss could be used as an ideal index representing tomato comprehensive fruit quality 3 5 trading off yield wp pfpn and fruit quality although we suggested that tss could represent the comprehensive fruit quality the determination of optimal irrigation and nitrogen rate should not only consider quality but also yield wp and pfpn the results of the ranking scores by topsis for all treatments are shown in table 8 the ranking scores of each year indicated that the n1i2 with qi values of 0 86 0 86 and 0 80 in 2017 2018 and 2019 respectively was the optimal irrigation and nitrogen management strategy for tomato production when averaged over the three years n1i2 had the highest qi value 0 84 which can best trade off tomato yield wp pfpn and fruit quality 4 discussion 4 1 effects of irrigation and nitrogen rate on yield tomato is a characteristically water demanding crop earlier studies reported that deficit irrigation significantly decreased yield jensen et al 2010 chen et al 2014 which is consistent with our study tomato is sensitive to water stress especially during the flowering and fruit setting stage nuruddin et al 2003 chen et al 2013 water deficit at these stages decreased fruit number and weight liu et al 2013 2019 consequently lowering the yield in addition deficit irrigation caused plasma membrane damage stomatal closure leaf damage and low photosynthetic capacity which resulted in a reduction in yield topcu et al 2007 patanè et al 2011 talbi et al 2015 tomato yield significantly increased with increasing nitrogen rate no more than 300 kg ha 1 because an increase in nitrogen rate enhanced the physiological growth of the crop and increased its absorption of water and nutrients drenovsky et al 2012 however yield significantly declined with further supply to 450 kg n ha 1 table 3 as the lowest yield 89 11 t ha 1 in n3i1 fig 1 under water stress condition i1 excessive nitrogen rate significantly decreased yield and this could be due to an increase in osmotic pressure of rhizosphere gonzalez dugo et al 2011 thus plants would need to acquire more energy to maintain cell water contents thereby reducing the transpiration and nutrient absorption capacities lahoz et al 2016 jalil et al 2019 which would eventually cause a significant reduction in yield fig 1 4 2 effects of irrigation and nitrogen rate on wp and pfpn our results showed that irrigation and nitrogen rate dynamically affected wp table 3 under severe water stress i1 the appropriate increase in nitrogen rate no more than 300 kg n ha 1 significantly enhanced wp fig 3 which was mainly due to the significant increase in yield but no significant decrease in et fig 1 and fig 2 however excessive nitrogen rate 450 kg ha 1 reduced wp owing to the remarkable reduction in yield in n3i1 fig 1 however under i2 and i3 wp asymptotically increased with increasing nitrogen rate no more than 300 kg ha 1 fig 3 owing to the similar response of the yield to nitrogen rate fig 1 but without significant change in et fig 2 at the same nitrogen rate except n3 wp significantly decreased with increasing irrigation amount which is consistent with kiymaz and ertek 2015 however when nitrogen rate was 450 kg ha 1 n3 wp increased first and then decreased with increasing irrigation amount under n3 the maximum wp was not associated with the minimum irrigation amount because the increase in water stress suppressed nutrient absorption and plant growth talbi et al 2015 which significantly reduced fruit yield fig 1 this was consistent with previous studies on tomato potato and eggplant kang et al 2004 ertek et al 2006 cantore et al 2016 similarly the minimum wp was not associated with the maximum irrigation amount in n3 because excessive irrigation with high nitrogen rate leads to vigorous plant growth and elevates rates of non productive transpiration fig 2 hence an increase in irrigation amount benefits yield but not wp under excessive nitrogen rate cantore et al 2016 wang et al 2017 pfpn is a common index used to represent nitrogen use efficiency peng et al 2002 wang et al 2017 jalil et al 2019 nafi et al 2019 our results showed that excessive nitrogen rate significantly reduced pfpn fig 4 and table 2 because it exceeded the optimal demands of tomato plants excessive nitrogen rate lead to inefficient nitrogen utilization and consequent nitrogen leaching and volatilization ju et al 2009 li et al 2017 eventually tomato yield remarkably decreased table 3 in contrast appropriate nitrogen rate have been shown to improve pfpn and yield and reduce the soil nitrate loss spiertz 2010 in our study pfpn increased with increasing irrigation amount mainly because yield significantly increased with increasing irrigation amounts under the same planting and nutrient conditions fig 1 4 3 effects of irrigation and nitrogen rate on fruit quality indicators our results showed that deficit irrigation markedly improved tss ssc vc and oa table 4 which agreed with previous studies patanè and cosentino 2010 chen et al 2014 liu et al 2019 water stress prevented the translocation of the phloem sap to the fruit causing a reduction in water accumulation and a relative increase in solute concentrations within the fruits mitchell and shennan 1991 guichard et al 2008 therefore the fruit water content declined but the accumulation of sugars and acids were virtually unaffected mitchell and shennan 1991 chen et al 2014 in addition water stress may also decrease the leaf area index resulting in an increase in the intensity and duration of the absorbed solar radiation which is beneficial to the accumulation of sugar and vc dumas et al 2003 fruit taste is largely determined by the contents of ssc oa as well as their ratio water deficit markedly increased the ssc and oa however there was only a slight increase in sar over the three years due to the consistent responses of ssc and oa to deficit irrigation table 4 tss an important tomato fruit quality indicator is the general term used to describe the soluble solids in tomato fruit pulp which includes about 65 sugar sucrose and hexose 13 organic acids citric acid and malate and 12 other minor components phenol amino acids soluble pectin ascorbic acid and minerals chen et al 2014 in our study ssc and oa accounted for 53 and 8 of the tss table 4 respectively alluding to the fact that decreasing irrigation amount might have boosted the production of tss the contents of ssc oa vc tss and sar significantly increased with increasing nitrogen rate no more than 300 kg ha 1 because the suitable nitrogen rate considerably improved n uptake which in turn would contribute to enhance the photosynthetic activity as well as the protein synthesis hoffmann 2005 rostamza et al 2011 however when nitrogen rate increased to 450 kg ha 1 the contents of ssc and vc decreased and the content of oa increased because excessive nitrogen rate impeded the nutrient absorption by tomato fruit li et al 2019 but improved the synthesis of amino acids and proteins from the nitrogen and organic acids consequently the demand for organic acids converted from sugars increased thereby augmenting sugar consumption and diminishing sugar accumulation sun et al 2011 besides the excessive nitrogen rate could promote crop growth broaden shade area and reduce temperature which ultimately induce acid synthesis benard et al 2009 therefore the excessive nitrogen rate decreased ssc but increased oa table 4 sugar is the raw material for vc synthesis hence a reduction in ssc may inhibit vc synthesis which is consistent with the findings of previous studies kuscu et al 2014 wang et al 2017 the highest sar was not measured at the highest nitrogen rate in the present study as the excessive nitrogen rate impeded the ssc production while facilitated oa synthesis table 4 as ssc and oa are the main components of tss liu et al 2019 and the excessive nitrogen rate reduced the ssc but improved the oa therefore there was no significant increase in tss when the nitrogen rate increased from 300 kg ha 1 to 450 kg ha 1 table 4 4 4 the evaluation and simplification of comprehensive fruit quality although there are numerous quality indicators which are generally difficult to quantify they are still important for determining the optimal irrigation and nitrogen management strategy for tomato production however some of quality indicators responded inconsistently to irrigation and nitrogen rates for example we found that deficit irrigation significantly improved tss whereas sar was independent of irrigation amount it was also found that tss and sar peaked at nitrogen rates of 450 kg ha 1 and 300 kg ha 1 respectively table 4 these findings confirmed our conviction that it was essential to establish a fruit quality index that could comprehensively reflect tomato fruit quality gra pca and topsis were considered as ideal methods to evaluate tomato comprehensive fruit quality wang et al 2015 luo and li 2018 liu et al 2019 however the results obtained by foregoing evaluation methods were inconsistent wang et al 2015 which is consistent with our results table 5 therefore we proposed a combination evaluation method cem based on pca topsis and gra however we identified a positive correlation relationship between cem and pca or gra the average spearman correlation coefficients over the three years were 0 9953 and 0 9860 respectively table 7 suggesting that pca and gra might be suitable models to evaluate tomato comprehensive fruit quality which is consistent with the previous study wang et al 2015 fruit quality comprises many attributes whose measurement are generally costly and complex however tomato quality was characterized reasonably well by tss ssc vc and oa causse et al 2003 stevens et al 2007 shi et al 2015 liu et al 2019 among these indicators the relative value of tss was highly positively correlated with the comprehensive fruit quality score calculated by pca and gra in the three years fig 5 moreover measuring tss is relatively cheap convenient rapid and accurate hence we propose that tss could be used as an index representing comprehensive fruit quality 4 5 the optimal irrigation and nitrogen management strategy optimal irrigation and nitrogen management strategy should trade off the relationships among yield wp nitrogen use efficiency pfpn and fruit quality in this study the full irrigation i3 improved yield and pfpn fig 1 and fig 4 but reduced fruit quality and wp fig 3 and table 4 the proper nitrogen rate 300 kg n ha 1 improved yield wp and fruit quality table 3 and table 4 but significantly reduced pfpn fig 4 and table 3 as the influences of irrigation and nitrogen rates on yield wp pfpn and fruit quality are complex the interactive influences cannot be revealed by qualitative analysis alone therefore it is imperative to develop the relationships among yield wp pfpn and fruit quality in response to different irrigation and nitrogen rates by using comprehensive analyses the results showed that topsis was capable of estimating optimal irrigation and nitrogen rates by best trading off yield wp pfpn and fruit quality in greenhouse grown tomato in our experiment topsis revealed that the n1i2 treatment ranked the first table 8 therefore the combined i2 70 of epan and n1 150 kg n ha 1 would be an optimal irrigation and nitrogen management strategy for tomato production in greenhouse 5 conclusions the moderate deficit irrigation i2 significantly improved fruit quality and crop water productivity wp but slightly decreased yield and nitrogen use efficiency pfpn of tomato the excessive nitrogen rate above 300 kg ha 1 did not increase yield fruit quality except organic acid and total soluble solid wp and pfpn principal component analysis pca and gray relational analysis gra were the suitable models for evaluating tomato comprehensive fruit quality the relative value of total soluble solid tssr had a significantly positive relationship with the comprehensive fruit quality score suggesting that tss could be used as a proxy presenting tomato comprehensive fruit quality analysis of all experimental data using topsis showed that n1i2 nitrogen rate 150 kg ha 1 irrigation amount 70 of epan gave the best results and it was the optimal irrigation and nitrogen management strategy for greenhouse tomato to best trade off yield wp pfpn and fruit quality declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known
