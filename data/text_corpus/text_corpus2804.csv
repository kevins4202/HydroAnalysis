14020,wastewater is an easily accessible but highly underutilized resource that could meet irrigation needs while conserving freshwater for future generations and is increasingly recognized as an essential and economical strategy in areas with water scarcity this paper presents case studies on the pond in pond pip configuration where pip is an integration of two types of pond anaerobic and aerobic and consists of a deeper inner section entirely submerged within the outer pond performance data from existing pip or pip like systems dated back to 1960s were collected and analyzed and the results from the pip systems investigated resulted in an average bod removal of over 80 with a deviation of less than 10 consequently the pip unit alone ensured a level of treatment required for effluent reuse in crop irrigation for typical municipal wastewater with influent bod in the range of 200 300 mg l 1 moreover the combination of pip with other processes in a treatment system has the capability of treating high strength wastewater for other uses such as aquaculture fishery and others including stream discharge the pip is a potentially viable and sustainable technology for low cost wastewater treatment especially for reuse purposes due to the savings in capital costs operations and maintenance costs and revenue from reclamation of the effluent keywords pond in pond natural treatment system bod removal reuse irrigation sustainability 1 introduction while the world s population is increasing the per capita freshwater resources are decreasing current understanding of our freshwater resources indicates that the planet s sustainable limit will be reached by about the year 2030 for food production and 2040 for potable water 1 the climate driven changes in evaporation precipitation and runoff have created additional stress on water availability in many parts of the world the changes in climatic factors are expected to amplify levels of water scarcity by up to 40 with an additional 15 of the global population expected to suffer water shortages if the world warms by just 2 c 2 water is not distributed evenly among the population of the world and thus the available water varies greatly among regions and so does the level of water scarcity regions at risk from water scarcity include parts of the southern united states the mediterranean and the middle east countries like jordan israel and iraq have faced up to a 45 reduction in their available per capita water supply in the last few decades 1 for instance countries like jordan with a population expected to continue to rise and the primary source of water affected by climate change will soon be in the category of absolute water scarcity absolute water scarcity is identified as a commonly used threshold when available water per capita is less than 500 cubic meters of water per year 3 with the current trends the per capita water supply for jordan will fall from the current 145 m3 yr to only 91 m3 yr by the year 2025 4 similar situations are expected to occur in other countries in africa the middle east and much of the southern united states in the united states reduced surface water available for crop irrigation has resulted in an increased dependency on groundwater thus the easily accessible sources of quality groundwater in the united states have been heavily consumed and developing new sources is difficult and costly if even possible after successive droughts in california crop production has been substantially limited 5 additionally peterson et al 6 project a 16 28 increase in the frequency of drought in the southwestern united states and average temperatures are projected to increase in coming decades 7 with precipitation not expected to increase proportionately 8 based on current population growth and finite natural resources incorporating water reuse technology is a necessity as fedler 9 noted it is not a matter of if we will utilize reuse technology in the future it is a matter of when we will use it to sustain economic growth and minimize environmental impacts 1 1 water use in agriculture irrigation is a major consumer of fresh water around the world if no sustainable approaches are adopted there will be insufficient water available nearly 70 of the fresh water consumed worldwide is by food production systems 10 in the united states 42 of the total freshwater consumed is used for crop irrigation 11 higher crop yields must occur in the future if countries are to meet the increasing need for food thus the strain on freshwater resources will continue to increase unless changes occur while options are limited for developing new water supplies many sources of wastewater are readily available and are produced within the proximity of the crop production operations if municipalities recycled their wastewater for irrigation rather than using fresh water that same volume of freshwater would then be available for public consumption currently the united states collects and treats about 45 109 m3 yr 1 2 1012 gallons yr of municipal wastewater of which less than 6 is reclaimed for beneficial purposes 12 yet if this water was reclaimed for crop production approximately 10 million hectares 25 million acres could be irrigated representing about half of the irrigated crop area in the united states 1 the reclamation rate is even less in the global context with only approximately 3 of municipal wastewater being recycled 13 if our crop production systems can adapt to using reclaimed water we will be able to sustain and possibly increase crop production for a much longer time 1 while continuing to provide adequate drinking water in addition the use of reclaimed water for irrigation improves the environment because it reduces the amount of waste treated or untreated discharged into water courses further it provides savings in the cost for treating wastewater for municipalities as treatment requirements for reuse are less stringent than stream discharge if 10 of the wastewater in united states was treated to meet regulatory requirements for land application to crops typically effluent bod 60 mg l 1 the estimated saving in operations and maintenance costs for wastewater treatment systems alone could be about 3 billion annually compared to stream discharge additionally reducing the number of new treatment plants required billions more in capital costs could be saved in the future as the population continues to grow 1 2 wastewater treatment system in the case of technologies available there is a plethora of systems from simple ponds to complicated mechanical systems that could be used for wastewater treatment it is well understood from past and current analyses that pond treatment systems are much lower in cost compared to conventional mechanical systems such as activated sludge systems biofiltration systems oxidation ditches rotating bio disc systems and membrane processes because of the amount of mechanical equipment involved in the conventional systems 14 25 additionally some pond systems can provide the organic removal with a level of effluent bod less than 60 mg l 1 the most appropriate design is one that will produce an effluent that meets the recommended microbiological and chemical quality guidelines both at low cost and with minimal operational and maintenance requirements 26 27 traditional ponds used for treating municipal wastewater range from aerobic to facultative to anaerobic based on their geometry hydraulic flows dominant biological reactions occurring in the ponds and their overall goals 28 several procedures have been developed to design the various types of ponds these methods include area loading first order plug flow first order complete mix dispersion model 29 32 and several regression models such as those proposed by mcgarry gloyna and larsen 33 35 many of these pond designs have been in existence for decades yet there is a lack of specific design guidelines for pond treatment systems and selection of a design procedure is difficult to ascertain 36 design parameters for ponds are limited primarily to the area loading criteria the area loading criteria is at best a rule of thumb design process with numerous contradictions 29 37 38 the practice of using the organic loading rates and retention times based upon a regional determinant north to south has often been reported as not continuously meeting effluent standards 29 the regression equations 33 35 established using the pond dimensions are adequate for preliminary design however serious considerations on flow dynamics and environmental conditions are required for their use on a larger scale since extrapolation is not recommended design approaches based on first order kinetic rates 30 39 and dispersion numbers 31 32 would ideally serve as the best design approach yet the use of such models is often limited due to difficulty in obtaining needed design parameters which are usually obtained only after performance data from the installed ponds are collected the latest advances in pond design with the application of computational fluid dynamics models 40 46 and integrated models 47 have helped design engineers better understand the flow dynamics and the effects of pond configuration on treatment performance 48 50 however the applicability of such mechanistic models is questioned due to the lack of model validation and the computing power requirements 47 also there exist contradictory viewpoints regarding pond dimensions as it relates to performance 36 some researchers claim pond dimensions such as length to width ratio and depth have no effect on pond performance 51 52 whereas others say that the length to width ratio and depth are major design factors 43 53 likewise there is lack of consensus on the effects of baffles on pond performance 42 46 48 54 this clearly illustrates that existing knowledge on the design of ponds is inadequate several researchers 29 36 55 57 have discussed the different pond systems existing design criteria and their limitations each of the traditional ponds aerobic or aerated aerobic anaerobic and facultative has advantages and limitations table 1 summarizes the advantages and limitations for these three major pond systems 23 55 58 59 aerobic ponds without aerators require a larger amount of land compared to all other ponds because of the shallow depths aerators help reduce the land area but they produce high concentrations of suspended solids in the effluent and require energy to complete the treatment process in addition the short retention times associated with aerobic treatment do not provide enough time for adequate coliform removal via solar radiation the anaerobic and even the facultative ponds have a potential problem with odors due to high organic loadings typically used in those ponds one possible solution to the inherent problems with the traditional ponds is to integrate the best functions of each into a single pond to allow the symbiotic relationships of related microorganisms to proceed without inhibition a detailed discussion on need and importance of such integrated systems can be found in adhikari and fedler 36 an integrated single pond system known as pond in pond pip provides a treatment process that combines the best functions of the aerobic and anaerobic ponds pip systems however have not been discussed in detail in terms of performance primarily due to a lack of data thus the objectives of this paper are to 1 gather performance data from existing pip systems and other ponds that are similar in configuration to the pip thereby producing a larger dataset and 2 evaluate the performance of the pip configuration for reuse systems based on the data collected from existing operations since little research on pip configurations has occurred over the past several decades this research went back to the 1960 s to obtain sufficient data for a more complete analysis of performance for pip like designs while considering newer approaches to designing typical ponds 2 pond in pond configuration the first known combined pond was in desert lake village near boron california in 1957 60 in that system a small deeper sub basin was placed within one corner of the overall basin this concept was further refined to include a slightly deeper section of the pond for confining the influent 28 36 61 63 the combined ponding unit with a depth of around 3 m 9 85 ft and retention time of up to 30 days provided effluent bod concentrations less than the required standards for reuse in land application typically 60 mg l 1 23 28 36 64 65 these combined systems require less capital energy and operation and maintenance costs than typical mechanical systems 14 15 23 36 66 and require less land produce fewer odors and fill in with sludge much more slowly than traditional ponds 67 since the initial treatment pond is submerged within an outer pond the term pond in pond pip was adopted as a simple descriptor for the system the pond in pond pip is a treatment technology in which two types of ponds anaerobic and aerobic are combined into a single pond 28 36 68 this configuration integrates the functions of each pond type into a single pond in which the top aerobic surface allows for photosynthetic oxygenation resulting in lower odor levels compared to traditional ponds and the bottom zone provides the anaerobic environment required for more complete conversion of complex organic matter the basic premise of the pip was to provide a protective zone for the anaerobic organisms to perform without interruption as shown in fig 1 the inner pond of the pip includes a berm at the top on all sides which serves as a barrier to mixing that can be caused by seasonal temperature stratification of the water and subsequent wind 36 68 69 the pip system provides more efficient conversion of organic matter the deeper section of the inner pond allows for a greater retention time of solids so that hard to degrade compounds can degrade more completely under anaerobic conditions the greatest part of the sludge is converted to gaseous form leaving behind only fixed solids at the bottom which is accounted for in the design life of the pond thus the pip offers an advantage over other pond systems by eliminating the need for periodic typically around 5 years removal of sludge handling of sludge build up in the bottom of the ponds has been one of the major issues in traditional pond systems as it reduces the volume for treatment and thus the retention time the configuration of the pond within a pond with the berms around the inner pond serves as a baffle within the pond and thus induces flow diversion which was found to be beneficial from several studies 19 42 46 70 using a computational fluid dynamics cfd analysis on baffled ponds cfd models simulate the fluid flow more precisely and offer flexibility in understanding the effects of external factors such as wind thermal stratification baffles 49 71 along with the pond inlet outlet configurations and determination of potential dead zones 48 50 within the pond the cfd models showed that the use of baffles and inlet outlet configurations has significant effects on pond performance and flow efficiency respectively this has allowed designers to more fully understand why stone 60 added the flow diversions to the process also the configuration of the pip allows for a reduction in the total area required for wastewater treatment compared to traditional ponds which reduces the capital cost 3 pond in pond case studies the pip system provides more efficient conversion of wastewater including high strength waste to end products in addition it requires essentially no energy input except for pumping of the waste into the system if gravity flow is not possible 28 36 the following section presents the case studies on such systems the case studies discussed in this paper are selected to cover the wide applicability of these systems 3 1 sewage treatment facility in desert lake village near boron california the desert lake village system was built in 1957 to serve a planned community of approximately 250 homes and other facilities in the community such as hotel units a shopping center and a school the system consists of a primary basin followed by secondary and tertiary basins that could be run in series as shown in fig 2 the primary basin was designed similar to the concept of the pip in which a deeper sub basin was placed inside the larger pond 60 the larger outer pond has the wetted area of 1 82 ha 4 5 acres and a minimum liquid depth of 0 9 m 3 ft with a 0 6 m 2 ft freeboard the smaller sub basin has an area of 2090 m2 22 500 ft2 and a water depth of 2 1 m 7 ft and the raw sewage was discharged into the deeper sub basin no performance data has been reported for this system but stone 60 reports that the system was working effectively based on experience of five similar installations stone 60 recommended the use of increased depths for the inner basin the deeper basin improved the depth diffusion of raw sewage providing greater algal and bacterial activity and treatment efficiency than a shallow basin of equivalent area in addition greater depths provided better control of swamp type vegetation and better inhibition of insect breeding this arrangement also greatly reduced the excavation cost 60 the total cost for installing the system including the pumping plant automatic controls fencing piping and all other components was less than 15 000 the annual operating cost was less than 1000 a year the operating costs for individual septic tanks and leach systems in nearby communities with similar population and sewage characteristics was approximately 15 000 annually 3 2 advanced integrated wastewater ponding system aiwps california the first advancement to the concept of the pip was adopted by oswald 68 when he placed a deeper section within a larger outer pond and added berms around the inner pond oswald 68 integrated his pip into an overall system and called it the advanced integrated wastewater ponding system aiwps that was developed to provide stream discharge of the municipal effluent this system consisted of four ponds in series as shown in fig 3 and was designed for treating municipal wastewater for stream discharge the first pond in the series is the pip referred to as an advanced facultative pond afp the pip has aerobic conditions on the surface and anaerobic at the bottom and consists of a deeper digestor pit inside a typical facultative pond in which the sludge is digested under anaerobic conditions performance data from the aiwps systems at multiple locations in california ca is presented in table 2 it illustrates that the pip component can remove influent bod in the range from 70 to above 90 the effluent bod from the pip unit in all four locations is below the 60 mg l 1 typically used for reuse in irrigation thus it is possible for the pip to stand alone as a single pond for treating municipal wastewater sufficiently for reuse as crop irrigation water in addition this design minimized the sludge handling requirements the system in st helena table 2 operated for over 20 years without sludge removal 63 likewise the hollister system operated for 10 years without sludge removal and was found to be of sufficient capacity for at least another 10 years by oswald 63 3 3 advanced integrated wastewater ponding system aiwps ethiopia the pilot scale aiwps facility was installed at the modjo tannery in ethiopia to study the seasonal and diurnal variations of ph dissolved oxygen do and temperature within the aiwps the system was comprised of a pip originally referred to as afp followed by a secondary facultative pond sfp and a maturation pond mp the pip was square in shape with 3 m 9 8 ft for both length and width and 3 5 m 11 5 ft depth and consists of a cylindrical submerged pit of 1 6 m 5 2 ft in diameter and 5 m 16 4 ft deep the vertical variations in ph temperature and dissolved oxygen do for the pip were minimal as compared to the variations in the sfp and mp 74 which indicates the use of the protected deeper pond in the pip system is appropriate the ph varied between 8 and 8 4 at the surface of the water to 7 2 at the bottom 9 near the surface to 8 2 at the bottom and 9 4 at the surface to 8 4 at the bottom for pip sfp and mp respectively the temperature for the pip varied by 2 along its depth with 20 24 near the surface to around 18 22 near the bottom whereas the temperature gradient for sfp and mp was 5 8 and 3 5 with near surface temperatures about 26 and 29 respectively likewise the do for the pip was less than 0 2 mgl 1 throughout its depth while the do varied between 20 mg l 1 at the surface to nearly zero at the bottom for both the sfp and mp the modjo tannery system was operated under three different feed flows the raw waste was passed through successive bar screens and was retained for 1 day in a two chamber horizontal settling tank hst prior to the pip unit the performance data in table 3 data extracted from tadesse et al 74 shows that the bod removal for the system was above 90 for all three cases among all the aiwps components the pip unit had the highest removal efficiencies with 89 73 and 82 percent for feed phase i ii and iii respectively 74 3 4 integrated facultative pond lubbock texas the system built at the animal science farm of texas tech university was designed to treat the waste from 1000 head of cattle and a 280 sow farrow to finish piggery operation which was preceded by a screening process 75 the system was established primarily to evaluate 1 the potential contamination of the underlying subsurface beneath the digestor pit without a liner and 2 energy recovery through methane capture not presented here however the study brings forth several merits of using the pip system in high strength wastewater treatment and provides an argument for adopting the pip design approach for water reuse purposes the system consisted of a 6 m 19 6 ft deep inner pond integrated with a 3 1 m 10 ft deep outer pond followed by shallow ponds for production of aquatic plants and fish the effluent from these ponds was collected in a storage basin and used in a slow rate land application system in addition to treatment of wastewater within the limits of required effluent bod for land application of livestock wastewater the aquatic plants and fish produced in the other ponds provided the ability to produce additional revenue for an industry that would utilize the technology this technology could provide an annual revenue of over 5 us million from the cattle feedlots located in texas when accounting for the energy and nutrients available 28 75 76 additional revenue is possible from the crops produced when the effluent is applied on a land application system thus the integrated system has capabilities of meeting the required bod standards for reuse while providing economic returns 3 5 municipal wastewater treatment system dove creek colorado the treatment facility at dove creek colorado serves approximately 700 people with an average annual influent bod of approximately 250 mg l 1 the system is similar to the pond in pond concept as it consists of a deep sludge cell preceding the aerobic cell the anaerobic pit is approximately 6 1 m 20 ft deep and the aerobic portion has a depth of about 4 m 13 ft the pond system is then followed by a free water surface wetland the performance data was measured in the wetland following the pond system and no effluent data is available for the individual ponds the wetland however was used only for the polishing of the effluent thus a major fraction of treatment is expected to have occurred in the pond system the final effluent bod was approximately 30 mg l 1 for most of the period between 2000 2006 except for a few exceedances during start up and during winter months 55 the high quality effluent from the system could possibly be due to the additional aeration provided to the aerobic cell as mentioned in the epa report 55 3 6 municipal wastewater treatment system colorado city texas a pip system in colorado city in west texas was designed for treating municipal wastewater for a population of 10 000 with an average annual influent bod of approximately 280 mg l 1 and has been in operation for more than 15 years the system consists of two pip units in parallel each with a surface area of approximately 24 000 sq m 6 acres a 3 1 side slope and a retention time of 22 days the depth of the inner pond is 4 6 m 15 ft and the outer pond is 3 m 10 ft deep the performance data for the last 10 years of operation from 2010 through 2019 show that the system is performing within its design limits of an effluent bod of less than 60 mg l 1 the detailed analysis of the performance data has been provided in adhikari and fedler 36 and it was observed that the overall average annual and monthly effluent bod were approximately 40 mg l 1 this clearly shows that the pip system effluent can be used for water reuse systems tables 4 and 5 present the annual and monthly average effluent bod respectively for the colorado city system 3 7 other systems in addition to the case studies discussed in this paper similar systems are in practice at several other locations in united states and other nations 55 81 some of the reported systems in united states are in napa ca ridgemark estates ca hilmar ca and some recently built systems in west texas likewise these systems have been reported in other countries such as africa india new zealand and australia these systems are not discussed in this paper due to unavailability of sufficient data 3 8 advantages and limitations pond systems are simple low cost and reliable wastewater treatment systems that have been used for many years to treat wastewater wastewater reuse in irrigation has two major objectives it improves the environment because it reduces the amount of waste treated or untreated discharged into water courses and it conserves water resources by lowering the demand for freshwater consumption for crop production 77 78 in addition use of reclaimed water in irrigation has several other benefits such as 1 the reclaimed water contains valuable nutrients for crop production thus providing nutrient rich water year around 9 65 2 the reduced need for commercial fertilizers 3 the potential increase in crop yields and 4 the income generation 28 also the sludge produced from pond treatment systems can be used in agriculture with benefits obtained from the nutrients and organic matter contained in sludge 79 the fertilizer and organic matter content of sludge offer resource and energy conservation and maintenance of soil fertility the pip configuration offers the advantage of being a stand alone unit as opposed to other pond systems requiring multiple units of anaerobic aerobic and or maturation ponds therefore much less land area is required when the inner pond depth is increased there is increased solids retention time thereby providing more efficient conversion of wastewater to end products in addition the pip configuration minimizes the need for sludge removal table 6 presents the performance data for different pip systems used for treating different influent types in which the average bod removal for all systems combined was above 80 despite simple construction the pip type systems still lack specific design guidelines especially the depth for the anaerobic pit the shape with respect to influent and effluent pipes and the heights of the berms surrounding the anaerobic pit all the case studies and the previous research show an improved performance with deeper ponds as opposed to shallow ponds but no optimal depth has been determined the systems are designed with depths ranging between 3 m 10 ft to more than 6 m 20 ft with performance not increasing proportionately a study on aiwps pond design for the last few decades shows an increasing trend in the adopted depths from about 3 4 m 9 13 ft to about 6 7 m 19 23 ft in more recent years 55 the increase in depth helps reduce the area requirement thereby lowering the capital cost however more research is required to study the effects of depth on pond performance lastly very few systems are in operation and lack adequate performance data to evaluate the applicability of such systems under different environmental conditions the biological activity slows during cold weather conditions thus inhibiting anaerobic reactions this could potentially lead to longer retention times or higher rates of sludge accumulation the applicability of such systems in low temperature environments is yet to be fully explored due to the limited data available within colder climates 4 performance data analysis the performance data gathered from the existing systems shows that the pip configuration can provide effluent within the required limits for reuse in land application fig 4 shows the influent and effluent bod and percentage bod removal for systems treating municipal wastewater the performance data from six different systems shows that the effluent bod is below 60 mg l 1 for all cases with an average bod removal rate of more than 80 likewise results from similar observations for systems treating high strength industrial waste as shown in fig 5 show that the systems on average removed approximately 80 of the bod furthermore variability in influent and effluent bod shows that regardless of incoming influent bod strength the effluent from these systems treating municipal wastewater are always within the typical standards for reuse as shown by the box and whisker diagram 1 1 the central rectangle represents the interquartile range iqr with segment inside the rectangle representing the median the whiskers above and below the box show the location of the maximum and minimum and any data points 1 5 iqr or more above the third quartile or 1 5 iqr or more below the first quartile are considered as outliers in fig 6 the influent bod for municipal wastewater shows a large variability with values ranging between 160 mg l 1 to 280 mg l 1 both the mean and median bod is approximately 225 mgl 1 the effluent however ranges between 17 mgl 1 to a maximum of 56 mgl 1 with an average effluent bod of approximately 39 mgl 1 lastly the bod removal percentages for all the systems were evaluated the pip systems in these cases provided removal efficiency ranging from 70 to above 90 as shown in fig 7 moreover all the systems regardless of the prevalent environmental conditions and influent bod concentrations have shown to reduce bod by approximately 80 on average with a deviation of less than 10 for reuse of effluents for land application the major concern is odor therefore the bod should be less than 100 mg l 1 with an extra level of precaution by limiting it to 60 mg l 1 thus this paper only considered bod removal for evaluating the performance of the pip systems for water reuse 5 cost costs associated with wastewater treatment facilities fall under one of two categories 1 capital costs and 2 operations and maintenance o m costs for the pip system the primary cost associated with construction of the pond includes the cost of the land excavation grading berm construction and inlet and outlet structures operating costs and energy requirements are minimal as the pip does not require an external source of energy and typically no mechanical systems 36 80 5 1 capital costs one of the major benefits of using the pip is a reduction in land area requirements compared to other pond systems which has been a major limitation in most multiple pond systems the concept of using a deeper pond inside another pond eliminates the installation of multiple units and reduces the land area requirements by more than 50 which reduces capital costs table 7 shows the area requirements for different pond systems aerobic anaerobic and facultative for the same level of treatment based on the current design criteria typically used the results shown in table 7 are for the following assumed characteristics of wastewater and environmental condition listed below a similar comparison of land area requirements can also be found in epa 55 design flow rate q 3786 m3d 1 1 mgd influent

000 5 2 operation and maintenance costs the pip systems are designed to operate by gravity flow and are entirely natural the only energy used is direct solar energy and no mechanical or electrically operated devices are required thus these systems are easy to operate do not need expert personnel and provide a savings in energy and power requirements another important advantage of these systems is the small amount of sludge they produce in these ponds sludge undergoes continuous digestion until nothing remains except the non degradable residue systems with similar configurations as the pip have been found to run for more than 25 years without sludge removal thereby providing a savings in sludge handling costs and substantial benefit in terms of meeting environmental regulations for residue disposal 63 6 discussion the pip is a treatment technology in which two types of ponds anaerobic and aerobic are combined into a single pond the inner deeper section provides anaerobic conditions for more complete degradation of organic matter while the outer pond provides additional treatment through the aerobic process used to control odor the systems discussed were designed for different purposes such as stream discharge energy and nutrient recovery and reuse of effluent on land application sites regardless all the systems have adopted the concept of the pip as their first treatment unit and have been found to be successful in producing required quality effluent moreover the performance data gathered from existing systems that date back to the 1960 s show an average bod removal of more than 80 thereby ensuring that the pip can adequately treat the typical municipal wastewater influent bod in the range of 200 300 mg l 1 for reuse in land application the afp in the aiwps system is no different than the pip and performance data from all systems used for treating municipal wastewater showed that the pip can produce effluent within the bod limits required for reuse in irrigation for tannery waste the pip has been found to substantially remove the bod concentration with more than 80 removal on average however for reuse of the effluent additional treatment unit must follow the pip the pip system used for treating municipal wastewater in dove creek colorado and colorado city west texas produced an average annual effluent lower than the required limits of 60 mg l 1 desired for reuse the system designed for treating cattle waste showed that it could provide revenue through the reuse of effluent for such things as producing aquatic plants and fishes and through use of the final effluent for land application in addition to the improved performance the configuration of the pip helps reduce the land area required as compared to conventional pond systems for the same level of treatment and requires minimal operation and maintenance cost the pip is therefore a lower cost treatment system however poorly designed deep ponds can be more costly and can often lead to operational issues such as odor problems short circuiting of flows and the need for sludge removal these problems could be the major reasons why most authorities in the field tend to prefer shallow ponds over deeper ponds considerable experience from the existing systems has clearly shown the relative importance of increased depth thus the pip system with improved understanding on pond hydraulics and pond performance and a more in depth study on pond design and configuration could be a beneficial system for wastewater reuse 7 conclusions with the increasing population and changing climatic factors there is a need for sustainable practices in utilizing our limited freshwater resources ponds have been in use for decades for treating wastewater and several design approaches have been proposed for designing those pond systems however no standard design guidelines exist that adequately predict continuous performance additionally there exist contradictory viewpoints regarding optimal pond dimensions and performance this clearly illustrates that existing knowledge on the design of these ponds is inadequate given the wide use of ponds for wastewater treatment and the lack of appropriate design parameters a simple low cost pond in pond pip could be used instead the consistent performance data from several systems showed that the pond in pond system has the potential to be used for many types of influent ranging from municipal wastewater to industrial wastewater and animal waste the performance data from the pip systems examined provided an average bod removal of greater than 80 with a standard deviation of less than 10 thus for typical municipal wastewater with an influent biological oxygen demand bod concentration between 200 and 300 mg l 1 the pip unit alone could provide adequate treatment required for reuse in crop irrigation in addition the pip can be used in combination with other processes in a treatment system for treating high strength wastewater and for other uses such as stream discharge aquaculture fishery and others lastly the savings in capital costs due to reduced area requirements savings in operations and maintenance and revenues from reclamation of effluent make the pip a potentially viable and sustainable technology for wastewater treatment especially for reuse purposes 8 research significance a single unit system such as the pip can be effectively used for treating municipal wastewater when followed by reuse of the effluent adopting these systems for use of reclaimed wastewater in irrigation eliminates the need for treating wastewater to stream discharge quality thus providing huge savings in capital operations and maintenance costs and energy requirements for instance in the case for the aiwps the effluent from the afp portion of the system was well below 60 mg l 1 as is required for reuse treatment from the three other units of that system combined provided only about an additional 15 20 removal of bod however the operation of those units is energy intensive thus use of the pip system for wastewater reuse in irrigation helps minimize cost for treatment while indirectly saving freshwater for human consumption in future years most of the municipal treatment systems are centralized and incur huge costs in transporting raw wastewater likewise additional cost is required for carrying the effluent to the point of discharge on the other hand the pip can be operated as a decentralized unit avoiding some of the conveyance costs the pip system has wide applicability in small and rural communities where the wastewater produced in the community can be treated locally and reused on adjacent farms adopting the pip system for treating domestic waste will help these small communities by reducing the cost for treating their wastewater and developing economic benefit from the reuse of that water for crop irrigation the pip is an economical system because it reduces the land area requirements by approximately 50 as opposed to other pond treatment systems for the same level of treatment in addition the pip facilitates energy capture since most of the sludge is converted to biodegradable end products if the inner pond was covered methane capture is possible which can be a source of additional revenue lastly the pip can be a better replacement to the existing first units in conventional ponding systems where higher quality effluent is required author agreement declaration all authors have seen and approved the final version of the manuscript being

14020,wastewater is an easily accessible but highly underutilized resource that could meet irrigation needs while conserving freshwater for future generations and is increasingly recognized as an essential and economical strategy in areas with water scarcity this paper presents case studies on the pond in pond pip configuration where pip is an integration of two types of pond anaerobic and aerobic and consists of a deeper inner section entirely submerged within the outer pond performance data from existing pip or pip like systems dated back to 1960s were collected and analyzed and the results from the pip systems investigated resulted in an average bod removal of over 80 with a deviation of less than 10 consequently the pip unit alone ensured a level of treatment required for effluent reuse in crop irrigation for typical municipal wastewater with influent bod in the range of 200 300 mg l 1 moreover the combination of pip with other processes in a treatment system has the capability of treating high strength wastewater for other uses such as aquaculture fishery and others including stream discharge the pip is a potentially viable and sustainable technology for low cost wastewater treatment especially for reuse purposes due to the savings in capital costs operations and maintenance costs and revenue from reclamation of the effluent keywords pond in pond natural treatment system bod removal reuse irrigation sustainability 1 introduction while the world s population is increasing the per capita freshwater resources are decreasing current understanding of our freshwater resources indicates that the planet s sustainable limit will be reached by about the year 2030 for food production and 2040 for potable water 1 the climate driven changes in evaporation precipitation and runoff have created additional stress on water availability in many parts of the world the changes in climatic factors are expected to amplify levels of water scarcity by up to 40 with an additional 15 of the global population expected to suffer water shortages if the world warms by just 2 c 2 water is not distributed evenly among the population of the world and thus the available water varies greatly among regions and so does the level of water scarcity regions at risk from water scarcity include parts of the southern united states the mediterranean and the middle east countries like jordan israel and iraq have faced up to a 45 reduction in their available per capita water supply in the last few decades 1 for instance countries like jordan with a population expected to continue to rise and the primary source of water affected by climate change will soon be in the category of absolute water scarcity absolute water scarcity is identified as a commonly used threshold when available water per capita is less than 500 cubic meters of water per year 3 with the current trends the per capita water supply for jordan will fall from the current 145 m3 yr to only 91 m3 yr by the year 2025 4 similar situations are expected to occur in other countries in africa the middle east and much of the southern united states in the united states reduced surface water available for crop irrigation has resulted in an increased dependency on groundwater thus the easily accessible sources of quality groundwater in the united states have been heavily consumed and developing new sources is difficult and costly if even possible after successive droughts in california crop production has been substantially limited 5 additionally peterson et al 6 project a 16 28 increase in the frequency of drought in the southwestern united states and average temperatures are projected to increase in coming decades 7 with precipitation not expected to increase proportionately 8 based on current population growth and finite natural resources incorporating water reuse technology is a necessity as fedler 9 noted it is not a matter of if we will utilize reuse technology in the future it is a matter of when we will use it to sustain economic growth and minimize environmental impacts 1 1 water use in agriculture irrigation is a major consumer of fresh water around the world if no sustainable approaches are adopted there will be insufficient water available nearly 70 of the fresh water consumed worldwide is by food production systems 10 in the united states 42 of the total freshwater consumed is used for crop irrigation 11 higher crop yields must occur in the future if countries are to meet the increasing need for food thus the strain on freshwater resources will continue to increase unless changes occur while options are limited for developing new water supplies many sources of wastewater are readily available and are produced within the proximity of the crop production operations if municipalities recycled their wastewater for irrigation rather than using fresh water that same volume of freshwater would then be available for public consumption currently the united states collects and treats about 45 109 m3 yr 1 2 1012 gallons yr of municipal wastewater of which less than 6 is reclaimed for beneficial purposes 12 yet if this water was reclaimed for crop production approximately 10 million hectares 25 million acres could be irrigated representing about half of the irrigated crop area in the united states 1 the reclamation rate is even less in the global context with only approximately 3 of municipal wastewater being recycled 13 if our crop production systems can adapt to using reclaimed water we will be able to sustain and possibly increase crop production for a much longer time 1 while continuing to provide adequate drinking water in addition the use of reclaimed water for irrigation improves the environment because it reduces the amount of waste treated or untreated discharged into water courses further it provides savings in the cost for treating wastewater for municipalities as treatment requirements for reuse are less stringent than stream discharge if 10 of the wastewater in united states was treated to meet regulatory requirements for land application to crops typically effluent bod 60 mg l 1 the estimated saving in operations and maintenance costs for wastewater treatment systems alone could be about 3 billion annually compared to stream discharge additionally reducing the number of new treatment plants required billions more in capital costs could be saved in the future as the population continues to grow 1 2 wastewater treatment system in the case of technologies available there is a plethora of systems from simple ponds to complicated mechanical systems that could be used for wastewater treatment it is well understood from past and current analyses that pond treatment systems are much lower in cost compared to conventional mechanical systems such as activated sludge systems biofiltration systems oxidation ditches rotating bio disc systems and membrane processes because of the amount of mechanical equipment involved in the conventional systems 14 25 additionally some pond systems can provide the organic removal with a level of effluent bod less than 60 mg l 1 the most appropriate design is one that will produce an effluent that meets the recommended microbiological and chemical quality guidelines both at low cost and with minimal operational and maintenance requirements 26 27 traditional ponds used for treating municipal wastewater range from aerobic to facultative to anaerobic based on their geometry hydraulic flows dominant biological reactions occurring in the ponds and their overall goals 28 several procedures have been developed to design the various types of ponds these methods include area loading first order plug flow first order complete mix dispersion model 29 32 and several regression models such as those proposed by mcgarry gloyna and larsen 33 35 many of these pond designs have been in existence for decades yet there is a lack of specific design guidelines for pond treatment systems and selection of a design procedure is difficult to ascertain 36 design parameters for ponds are limited primarily to the area loading criteria the area loading criteria is at best a rule of thumb design process with numerous contradictions 29 37 38 the practice of using the organic loading rates and retention times based upon a regional determinant north to south has often been reported as not continuously meeting effluent standards 29 the regression equations 33 35 established using the pond dimensions are adequate for preliminary design however serious considerations on flow dynamics and environmental conditions are required for their use on a larger scale since extrapolation is not recommended design approaches based on first order kinetic rates 30 39 and dispersion numbers 31 32 would ideally serve as the best design approach yet the use of such models is often limited due to difficulty in obtaining needed design parameters which are usually obtained only after performance data from the installed ponds are collected the latest advances in pond design with the application of computational fluid dynamics models 40 46 and integrated models 47 have helped design engineers better understand the flow dynamics and the effects of pond configuration on treatment performance 48 50 however the applicability of such mechanistic models is questioned due to the lack of model validation and the computing power requirements 47 also there exist contradictory viewpoints regarding pond dimensions as it relates to performance 36 some researchers claim pond dimensions such as length to width ratio and depth have no effect on pond performance 51 52 whereas others say that the length to width ratio and depth are major design factors 43 53 likewise there is lack of consensus on the effects of baffles on pond performance 42 46 48 54 this clearly illustrates that existing knowledge on the design of ponds is inadequate several researchers 29 36 55 57 have discussed the different pond systems existing design criteria and their limitations each of the traditional ponds aerobic or aerated aerobic anaerobic and facultative has advantages and limitations table 1 summarizes the advantages and limitations for these three major pond systems 23 55 58 59 aerobic ponds without aerators require a larger amount of land compared to all other ponds because of the shallow depths aerators help reduce the land area but they produce high concentrations of suspended solids in the effluent and require energy to complete the treatment process in addition the short retention times associated with aerobic treatment do not provide enough time for adequate coliform removal via solar radiation the anaerobic and even the facultative ponds have a potential problem with odors due to high organic loadings typically used in those ponds one possible solution to the inherent problems with the traditional ponds is to integrate the best functions of each into a single pond to allow the symbiotic relationships of related microorganisms to proceed without inhibition a detailed discussion on need and importance of such integrated systems can be found in adhikari and fedler 36 an integrated single pond system known as pond in pond pip provides a treatment process that combines the best functions of the aerobic and anaerobic ponds pip systems however have not been discussed in detail in terms of performance primarily due to a lack of data thus the objectives of this paper are to 1 gather performance data from existing pip systems and other ponds that are similar in configuration to the pip thereby producing a larger dataset and 2 evaluate the performance of the pip configuration for reuse systems based on the data collected from existing operations since little research on pip configurations has occurred over the past several decades this research went back to the 1960 s to obtain sufficient data for a more complete analysis of performance for pip like designs while considering newer approaches to designing typical ponds 2 pond in pond configuration the first known combined pond was in desert lake village near boron california in 1957 60 in that system a small deeper sub basin was placed within one corner of the overall basin this concept was further refined to include a slightly deeper section of the pond for confining the influent 28 36 61 63 the combined ponding unit with a depth of around 3 m 9 85 ft and retention time of up to 30 days provided effluent bod concentrations less than the required standards for reuse in land application typically 60 mg l 1 23 28 36 64 65 these combined systems require less capital energy and operation and maintenance costs than typical mechanical systems 14 15 23 36 66 and require less land produce fewer odors and fill in with sludge much more slowly than traditional ponds 67 since the initial treatment pond is submerged within an outer pond the term pond in pond pip was adopted as a simple descriptor for the system the pond in pond pip is a treatment technology in which two types of ponds anaerobic and aerobic are combined into a single pond 28 36 68 this configuration integrates the functions of each pond type into a single pond in which the top aerobic surface allows for photosynthetic oxygenation resulting in lower odor levels compared to traditional ponds and the bottom zone provides the anaerobic environment required for more complete conversion of complex organic matter the basic premise of the pip was to provide a protective zone for the anaerobic organisms to perform without interruption as shown in fig 1 the inner pond of the pip includes a berm at the top on all sides which serves as a barrier to mixing that can be caused by seasonal temperature stratification of the water and subsequent wind 36 68 69 the pip system provides more efficient conversion of organic matter the deeper section of the inner pond allows for a greater retention time of solids so that hard to degrade compounds can degrade more completely under anaerobic conditions the greatest part of the sludge is converted to gaseous form leaving behind only fixed solids at the bottom which is accounted for in the design life of the pond thus the pip offers an advantage over other pond systems by eliminating the need for periodic typically around 5 years removal of sludge handling of sludge build up in the bottom of the ponds has been one of the major issues in traditional pond systems as it reduces the volume for treatment and thus the retention time the configuration of the pond within a pond with the berms around the inner pond serves as a baffle within the pond and thus induces flow diversion which was found to be beneficial from several studies 19 42 46 70 using a computational fluid dynamics cfd analysis on baffled ponds cfd models simulate the fluid flow more precisely and offer flexibility in understanding the effects of external factors such as wind thermal stratification baffles 49 71 along with the pond inlet outlet configurations and determination of potential dead zones 48 50 within the pond the cfd models showed that the use of baffles and inlet outlet configurations has significant effects on pond performance and flow efficiency respectively this has allowed designers to more fully understand why stone 60 added the flow diversions to the process also the configuration of the pip allows for a reduction in the total area required for wastewater treatment compared to traditional ponds which reduces the capital cost 3 pond in pond case studies the pip system provides more efficient conversion of wastewater including high strength waste to end products in addition it requires essentially no energy input except for pumping of the waste into the system if gravity flow is not possible 28 36 the following section presents the case studies on such systems the case studies discussed in this paper are selected to cover the wide applicability of these systems 3 1 sewage treatment facility in desert lake village near boron california the desert lake village system was built in 1957 to serve a planned community of approximately 250 homes and other facilities in the community such as hotel units a shopping center and a school the system consists of a primary basin followed by secondary and tertiary basins that could be run in series as shown in fig 2 the primary basin was designed similar to the concept of the pip in which a deeper sub basin was placed inside the larger pond 60 the larger outer pond has the wetted area of 1 82 ha 4 5 acres and a minimum liquid depth of 0 9 m 3 ft with a 0 6 m 2 ft freeboard the smaller sub basin has an area of 2090 m2 22 500 ft2 and a water depth of 2 1 m 7 ft and the raw sewage was discharged into the deeper sub basin no performance data has been reported for this system but stone 60 reports that the system was working effectively based on experience of five similar installations stone 60 recommended the use of increased depths for the inner basin the deeper basin improved the depth diffusion of raw sewage providing greater algal and bacterial activity and treatment efficiency than a shallow basin of equivalent area in addition greater depths provided better control of swamp type vegetation and better inhibition of insect breeding this arrangement also greatly reduced the excavation cost 60 the total cost for installing the system including the pumping plant automatic controls fencing piping and all other components was less than 15 000 the annual operating cost was less than 1000 a year the operating costs for individual septic tanks and leach systems in nearby communities with similar population and sewage characteristics was approximately 15 000 annually 3 2 advanced integrated wastewater ponding system aiwps california the first advancement to the concept of the pip was adopted by oswald 68 when he placed a deeper section within a larger outer pond and added berms around the inner pond oswald 68 integrated his pip into an overall system and called it the advanced integrated wastewater ponding system aiwps that was developed to provide stream discharge of the municipal effluent this system consisted of four ponds in series as shown in fig 3 and was designed for treating municipal wastewater for stream discharge the first pond in the series is the pip referred to as an advanced facultative pond afp the pip has aerobic conditions on the surface and anaerobic at the bottom and consists of a deeper digestor pit inside a typical facultative pond in which the sludge is digested under anaerobic conditions performance data from the aiwps systems at multiple locations in california ca is presented in table 2 it illustrates that the pip component can remove influent bod in the range from 70 to above 90 the effluent bod from the pip unit in all four locations is below the 60 mg l 1 typically used for reuse in irrigation thus it is possible for the pip to stand alone as a single pond for treating municipal wastewater sufficiently for reuse as crop irrigation water in addition this design minimized the sludge handling requirements the system in st helena table 2 operated for over 20 years without sludge removal 63 likewise the hollister system operated for 10 years without sludge removal and was found to be of sufficient capacity for at least another 10 years by oswald 63 3 3 advanced integrated wastewater ponding system aiwps ethiopia the pilot scale aiwps facility was installed at the modjo tannery in ethiopia to study the seasonal and diurnal variations of ph dissolved oxygen do and temperature within the aiwps the system was comprised of a pip originally referred to as afp followed by a secondary facultative pond sfp and a maturation pond mp the pip was square in shape with 3 m 9 8 ft for both length and width and 3 5 m 11 5 ft depth and consists of a cylindrical submerged pit of 1 6 m 5 2 ft in diameter and 5 m 16 4 ft deep the vertical variations in ph temperature and dissolved oxygen do for the pip were minimal as compared to the variations in the sfp and mp 74 which indicates the use of the protected deeper pond in the pip system is appropriate the ph varied between 8 and 8 4 at the surface of the water to 7 2 at the bottom 9 near the surface to 8 2 at the bottom and 9 4 at the surface to 8 4 at the bottom for pip sfp and mp respectively the temperature for the pip varied by 2 along its depth with 20 24 near the surface to around 18 22 near the bottom whereas the temperature gradient for sfp and mp was 5 8 and 3 5 with near surface temperatures about 26 and 29 respectively likewise the do for the pip was less than 0 2 mgl 1 throughout its depth while the do varied between 20 mg l 1 at the surface to nearly zero at the bottom for both the sfp and mp the modjo tannery system was operated under three different feed flows the raw waste was passed through successive bar screens and was retained for 1 day in a two chamber horizontal settling tank hst prior to the pip unit the performance data in table 3 data extracted from tadesse et al 74 shows that the bod removal for the system was above 90 for all three cases among all the aiwps components the pip unit had the highest removal efficiencies with 89 73 and 82 percent for feed phase i ii and iii respectively 74 3 4 integrated facultative pond lubbock texas the system built at the animal science farm of texas tech university was designed to treat the waste from 1000 head of cattle and a 280 sow farrow to finish piggery operation which was preceded by a screening process 75 the system was established primarily to evaluate 1 the potential contamination of the underlying subsurface beneath the digestor pit without a liner and 2 energy recovery through methane capture not presented here however the study brings forth several merits of using the pip system in high strength wastewater treatment and provides an argument for adopting the pip design approach for water reuse purposes the system consisted of a 6 m 19 6 ft deep inner pond integrated with a 3 1 m 10 ft deep outer pond followed by shallow ponds for production of aquatic plants and fish the effluent from these ponds was collected in a storage basin and used in a slow rate land application system in addition to treatment of wastewater within the limits of required effluent bod for land application of livestock wastewater the aquatic plants and fish produced in the other ponds provided the ability to produce additional revenue for an industry that would utilize the technology this technology could provide an annual revenue of over 5 us million from the cattle feedlots located in texas when accounting for the energy and nutrients available 28 75 76 additional revenue is possible from the crops produced when the effluent is applied on a land application system thus the integrated system has capabilities of meeting the required bod standards for reuse while providing economic returns 3 5 municipal wastewater treatment system dove creek colorado the treatment facility at dove creek colorado serves approximately 700 people with an average annual influent bod of approximately 250 mg l 1 the system is similar to the pond in pond concept as it consists of a deep sludge cell preceding the aerobic cell the anaerobic pit is approximately 6 1 m 20 ft deep and the aerobic portion has a depth of about 4 m 13 ft the pond system is then followed by a free water surface wetland the performance data was measured in the wetland following the pond system and no effluent data is available for the individual ponds the wetland however was used only for the polishing of the effluent thus a major fraction of treatment is expected to have occurred in the pond system the final effluent bod was approximately 30 mg l 1 for most of the period between 2000 2006 except for a few exceedances during start up and during winter months 55 the high quality effluent from the system could possibly be due to the additional aeration provided to the aerobic cell as mentioned in the epa report 55 3 6 municipal wastewater treatment system colorado city texas a pip system in colorado city in west texas was designed for treating municipal wastewater for a population of 10 000 with an average annual influent bod of approximately 280 mg l 1 and has been in operation for more than 15 years the system consists of two pip units in parallel each with a surface area of approximately 24 000 sq m 6 acres a 3 1 side slope and a retention time of 22 days the depth of the inner pond is 4 6 m 15 ft and the outer pond is 3 m 10 ft deep the performance data for the last 10 years of operation from 2010 through 2019 show that the system is performing within its design limits of an effluent bod of less than 60 mg l 1 the detailed analysis of the performance data has been provided in adhikari and fedler 36 and it was observed that the overall average annual and monthly effluent bod were approximately 40 mg l 1 this clearly shows that the pip system effluent can be used for water reuse systems tables 4 and 5 present the annual and monthly average effluent bod respectively for the colorado city system 3 7 other systems in addition to the case studies discussed in this paper similar systems are in practice at several other locations in united states and other nations 55 81 some of the reported systems in united states are in napa ca ridgemark estates ca hilmar ca and some recently built systems in west texas likewise these systems have been reported in other countries such as africa india new zealand and australia these systems are not discussed in this paper due to unavailability of sufficient data 3 8 advantages and limitations pond systems are simple low cost and reliable wastewater treatment systems that have been used for many years to treat wastewater wastewater reuse in irrigation has two major objectives it improves the environment because it reduces the amount of waste treated or untreated discharged into water courses and it conserves water resources by lowering the demand for freshwater consumption for crop production 77 78 in addition use of reclaimed water in irrigation has several other benefits such as 1 the reclaimed water contains valuable nutrients for crop production thus providing nutrient rich water year around 9 65 2 the reduced need for commercial fertilizers 3 the potential increase in crop yields and 4 the income generation 28 also the sludge produced from pond treatment systems can be used in agriculture with benefits obtained from the nutrients and organic matter contained in sludge 79 the fertilizer and organic matter content of sludge offer resource and energy conservation and maintenance of soil fertility the pip configuration offers the advantage of being a stand alone unit as opposed to other pond systems requiring multiple units of anaerobic aerobic and or maturation ponds therefore much less land area is required when the inner pond depth is increased there is increased solids retention time thereby providing more efficient conversion of wastewater to end products in addition the pip configuration minimizes the need for sludge removal table 6 presents the performance data for different pip systems used for treating different influent types in which the average bod removal for all systems combined was above 80 despite simple construction the pip type systems still lack specific design guidelines especially the depth for the anaerobic pit the shape with respect to influent and effluent pipes and the heights of the berms surrounding the anaerobic pit all the case studies and the previous research show an improved performance with deeper ponds as opposed to shallow ponds but no optimal depth has been determined the systems are designed with depths ranging between 3 m 10 ft to more than 6 m 20 ft with performance not increasing proportionately a study on aiwps pond design for the last few decades shows an increasing trend in the adopted depths from about 3 4 m 9 13 ft to about 6 7 m 19 23 ft in more recent years 55 the increase in depth helps reduce the area requirement thereby lowering the capital cost however more research is required to study the effects of depth on pond performance lastly very few systems are in operation and lack adequate performance data to evaluate the applicability of such systems under different environmental conditions the biological activity slows during cold weather conditions thus inhibiting anaerobic reactions this could potentially lead to longer retention times or higher rates of sludge accumulation the applicability of such systems in low temperature environments is yet to be fully explored due to the limited data available within colder climates 4 performance data analysis the performance data gathered from the existing systems shows that the pip configuration can provide effluent within the required limits for reuse in land application fig 4 shows the influent and effluent bod and percentage bod removal for systems treating municipal wastewater the performance data from six different systems shows that the effluent bod is below 60 mg l 1 for all cases with an average bod removal rate of more than 80 likewise results from similar observations for systems treating high strength industrial waste as shown in fig 5 show that the systems on average removed approximately 80 of the bod furthermore variability in influent and effluent bod shows that regardless of incoming influent bod strength the effluent from these systems treating municipal wastewater are always within the typical standards for reuse as shown by the box and whisker diagram 1 1 the central rectangle represents the interquartile range iqr with segment inside the rectangle representing the median the whiskers above and below the box show the location of the maximum and minimum and any data points 1 5 iqr or more above the third quartile or 1 5 iqr or more below the first quartile are considered as outliers in fig 6 the influent bod for municipal wastewater shows a large variability with values ranging between 160 mg l 1 to 280 mg l 1 both the mean and median bod is approximately 225 mgl 1 the effluent however ranges between 17 mgl 1 to a maximum of 56 mgl 1 with an average effluent bod of approximately 39 mgl 1 lastly the bod removal percentages for all the systems were evaluated the pip systems in these cases provided removal efficiency ranging from 70 to above 90 as shown in fig 7 moreover all the systems regardless of the prevalent environmental conditions and influent bod concentrations have shown to reduce bod by approximately 80 on average with a deviation of less than 10 for reuse of effluents for land application the major concern is odor therefore the bod should be less than 100 mg l 1 with an extra level of precaution by limiting it to 60 mg l 1 thus this paper only considered bod removal for evaluating the performance of the pip systems for water reuse 5 cost costs associated with wastewater treatment facilities fall under one of two categories 1 capital costs and 2 operations and maintenance o m costs for the pip system the primary cost associated with construction of the pond includes the cost of the land excavation grading berm construction and inlet and outlet structures operating costs and energy requirements are minimal as the pip does not require an external source of energy and typically no mechanical systems 36 80 5 1 capital costs one of the major benefits of using the pip is a reduction in land area requirements compared to other pond systems which has been a major limitation in most multiple pond systems the concept of using a deeper pond inside another pond eliminates the installation of multiple units and reduces the land area requirements by more than 50 which reduces capital costs table 7 shows the area requirements for different pond systems aerobic anaerobic and facultative for the same level of treatment based on the current design criteria typically used the results shown in table 7 are for the following assumed characteristics of wastewater and environmental condition listed below a similar comparison of land area requirements can also be found in epa 55 design flow rate q 3786 m3d 1 1 mgd influent

000 5 2 operation and maintenance costs the pip systems are designed to operate by gravity flow and are entirely natural the only energy used is direct solar energy and no mechanical or electrically operated devices are required thus these systems are easy to operate do not need expert personnel and provide a savings in energy and power requirements another important advantage of these systems is the small amount of sludge they produce in these ponds sludge undergoes continuous digestion until nothing remains except the non degradable residue systems with similar configurations as the pip have been found to run for more than 25 years without sludge removal thereby providing a savings in sludge handling costs and substantial benefit in terms of meeting environmental regulations for residue disposal 63 6 discussion the pip is a treatment technology in which two types of ponds anaerobic and aerobic are combined into a single pond the inner deeper section provides anaerobic conditions for more complete degradation of organic matter while the outer pond provides additional treatment through the aerobic process used to control odor the systems discussed were designed for different purposes such as stream discharge energy and nutrient recovery and reuse of effluent on land application sites regardless all the systems have adopted the concept of the pip as their first treatment unit and have been found to be successful in producing required quality effluent moreover the performance data gathered from existing systems that date back to the 1960 s show an average bod removal of more than 80 thereby ensuring that the pip can adequately treat the typical municipal wastewater influent bod in the range of 200 300 mg l 1 for reuse in land application the afp in the aiwps system is no different than the pip and performance data from all systems used for treating municipal wastewater showed that the pip can produce effluent within the bod limits required for reuse in irrigation for tannery waste the pip has been found to substantially remove the bod concentration with more than 80 removal on average however for reuse of the effluent additional treatment unit must follow the pip the pip system used for treating municipal wastewater in dove creek colorado and colorado city west texas produced an average annual effluent lower than the required limits of 60 mg l 1 desired for reuse the system designed for treating cattle waste showed that it could provide revenue through the reuse of effluent for such things as producing aquatic plants and fishes and through use of the final effluent for land application in addition to the improved performance the configuration of the pip helps reduce the land area required as compared to conventional pond systems for the same level of treatment and requires minimal operation and maintenance cost the pip is therefore a lower cost treatment system however poorly designed deep ponds can be more costly and can often lead to operational issues such as odor problems short circuiting of flows and the need for sludge removal these problems could be the major reasons why most authorities in the field tend to prefer shallow ponds over deeper ponds considerable experience from the existing systems has clearly shown the relative importance of increased depth thus the pip system with improved understanding on pond hydraulics and pond performance and a more in depth study on pond design and configuration could be a beneficial system for wastewater reuse 7 conclusions with the increasing population and changing climatic factors there is a need for sustainable practices in utilizing our limited freshwater resources ponds have been in use for decades for treating wastewater and several design approaches have been proposed for designing those pond systems however no standard design guidelines exist that adequately predict continuous performance additionally there exist contradictory viewpoints regarding optimal pond dimensions and performance this clearly illustrates that existing knowledge on the design of these ponds is inadequate given the wide use of ponds for wastewater treatment and the lack of appropriate design parameters a simple low cost pond in pond pip could be used instead the consistent performance data from several systems showed that the pond in pond system has the potential to be used for many types of influent ranging from municipal wastewater to industrial wastewater and animal waste the performance data from the pip systems examined provided an average bod removal of greater than 80 with a standard deviation of less than 10 thus for typical municipal wastewater with an influent biological oxygen demand bod concentration between 200 and 300 mg l 1 the pip unit alone could provide adequate treatment required for reuse in crop irrigation in addition the pip can be used in combination with other processes in a treatment system for treating high strength wastewater and for other uses such as stream discharge aquaculture fishery and others lastly the savings in capital costs due to reduced area requirements savings in operations and maintenance and revenues from reclamation of effluent make the pip a potentially viable and sustainable technology for wastewater treatment especially for reuse purposes 8 research significance a single unit system such as the pip can be effectively used for treating municipal wastewater when followed by reuse of the effluent adopting these systems for use of reclaimed wastewater in irrigation eliminates the need for treating wastewater to stream discharge quality thus providing huge savings in capital operations and maintenance costs and energy requirements for instance in the case for the aiwps the effluent from the afp portion of the system was well below 60 mg l 1 as is required for reuse treatment from the three other units of that system combined provided only about an additional 15 20 removal of bod however the operation of those units is energy intensive thus use of the pip system for wastewater reuse in irrigation helps minimize cost for treatment while indirectly saving freshwater for human consumption in future years most of the municipal treatment systems are centralized and incur huge costs in transporting raw wastewater likewise additional cost is required for carrying the effluent to the point of discharge on the other hand the pip can be operated as a decentralized unit avoiding some of the conveyance costs the pip system has wide applicability in small and rural communities where the wastewater produced in the community can be treated locally and reused on adjacent farms adopting the pip system for treating domestic waste will help these small communities by reducing the cost for treating their wastewater and developing economic benefit from the reuse of that water for crop irrigation the pip is an economical system because it reduces the land area requirements by approximately 50 as opposed to other pond treatment systems for the same level of treatment in addition the pip facilitates energy capture since most of the sludge is converted to biodegradable end products if the inner pond was covered methane capture is possible which can be a source of additional revenue lastly the pip can be a better replacement to the existing first units in conventional ponding systems where higher quality effluent is required author agreement declaration all authors have seen and approved the final version of the manuscript being

wetland microbial fuel cell ufcw mfc were investigated in this study this study was operated for four stages where stage i was conducted without plant and aeration stage ii was planted with eichhornia crassipes supplementary aeration was provided in stage iii stage iv was operated in open circuit the supplementary aeration showed the most significant effect on the performance of ufcw mfc compared to floating plant and circuit connection the optimum performance of wastewater treatment and electricity production was found in stage iii as the oxygen was supplied by the floating plant and supplementary aeration for the degradation of organic matters as well as the generation of bioelectricity the chemical oxygen demand cod nh4 and no3 removal efficiencies were 99 96 and 44 respectively e crassipes and supplementary aeration improved the dissolved oxygen do concentration at the cathodic region and enhanced the nh4 removal by 10 stage ii and 67 stage iii compared to the non planted bioreactor stage i closed circuit also performed 6 better than open circuit at sampling point 1 s1 in cod reduction the maximum power density voltage output coulombic efficiency and normalized energy

wastewater treatment 1 introduction energy shortage and water pollution are two major global problems faced by human beings nowadays water is required by all living things to survive as well as energy production on the other hand energy is needed for wastewater treatment and water purification the current method used for energy generation is unsustainable for human need and pollution control as the energy demand keeps increasing due to the increase in population and most of the pollution control is high energy consuming hence researches have been driven to explore more sustainable technology to solve both problems simultaneously 1 4 constructed wetland cw is an engineered system that has been developed for many years as one of the methods to purify wastewater by using the natural process and the treatment process includes physical chemical and microbial activities 5 cw is favourable to be used as the treatment process of wastewater due to the low cost in construction and maintenance 6 as well as the capability of treating a wide range of wastewater such as municipal wastewaters industrial and agricultural wastewaters landfill leachate and stormwater runoff 7 macrophytes also play an important role in the constructed wetland such as provide large surface area for microbial attachment and growth provide a good condition for physical filtration and stabilize the surface beds besides oxygen is also released and transferred by the plants through the root system which is needed to improve the organic matter degradation and nitrification process 8 microbial fuel cell mfc is an advanced technology that has drawn a lot of interest from scientists and researchers as it showed great potential in converting organic matters into bioelectricity through the microbial activities 9 mfc consists of an anode which acts as a negative terminal and a cathode which acts as the positive terminal 10 the substrates in the wastewater are utilized by electrogenic bacteria for the metabolic activities to generate electrons at the anode an external circuit was provided for the electrons to flow from anode to cathode to generate electricity 11 oxygen an electron acceptor is then reacted with the electrons transferred from the anode at the cathode to produce water and another reduced compound 12 hybrid system of cw and mfc cw mfc is a treatment system that embeds the cathode and anode of mfc in cw similarities between cws and mfcs have driven the combination of these two systems both cws and mfcs are utilizing microorganisms in the degradation of organic matter moreover the redox gradient an anaerobic anode and aerobic cathode which is required for the operation of mfcs can be obtained naturally in cws based on flow direction and depth of wetland 1 most of the cw mfc systems were operated in an up flow condition where the anode is buried and the cathode is exposed to the surface or rhizosphere of the plant this is because upflowed cw mfc ufcw mfc is capable to maximize the redox gradient in the system which is an important factor that contributes to electricity production from the system 3 in ufcw mfc the bottom bed of the system is used as anodic chamber which is in anaerobic environment while the upper bed is in aerobic environment where mineralization of aromatic amines nitrification and further degradation of unutilized organic matter from the lower region occurred 13 the individual weakness of cw and mfc could be enhanced and improved by the hybrid system of cw and mfc several studies on the role of plants aeration and circuit connection on the performance of cw mfc have been conducted separately but there is limited study on the comparison and optimization of these three operating parameters furthermore most of the cw mfc studies were using the emergent and submerged plant as the macrophytes in the studies while there is a lack of study on the implementation of floating plant in cw mfc to the best of the authors knowledge there are also limited studies on the kinetic in cw mfc thus the main aims of this study are to explore the role of floating plant as well as the influence of aeration and circuit connection on the wastewater treatment and electricity production in up flow constructed wetland microbial fuel cell ufcw mfc comparison and optimization of these operating parameters were conducted through the statistical analysis and kinetic study to further investigate the significance of these operating parameters on the performance of cw mfc 2 materials and methods 2 1 ufcw mfc setup and operation as shown in fig 1 the bioreactor was constructed using an acrylic column with an internal diameter of 17 5 cm and a height of 75 cm the bioreactor was placed outdoor at an average temperature of 29 3 c glass beads average diameter of 1 cm were placed at the bottom of the bioreactor up to 3 cm to develop a uniform flow of wastewater gravel average diameter of 0 6 cm was used as supporting medium and granular activated carbon was served as the anode and cathode in this ufcw mfc system five sampling points were designed along the bioreactor at the 7 21 36 51 and 66 cm from the bottom of the wetland bed 14 three layers of anode were developed to study the influence of electrode spacing on the electricity generation in ufcw mfc three anodes were embedded at 8 cm 23 cm and 38 cm while cathode was placed at 53 cm from the bottom of the bioreactor each layer of anodes and cathode was made of 2405 59 cm3 of activated carbon a mixed culture sludge was obtained from the wastewater treatment plant of shorubber malaysia sdn bhd and used for the inoculation of activated carbon and gravels for a month before transferred into the bioreactor the connection between anodes and cathode was carried out by using insulated copper wires carbon rod stainless steel and resistor with an external resistance of 1000 ω a data logger midi logger gl820 graphtec was connected to the bioreactor to record the voltage output of the bioreactor the bioreactor was operated in four stages to investigate the effect of the floating plant aeration and circuit connection on the performance of ufcw mfc at stage i the bioreactor was operated without plant and aeration after the system reached the stable condition a floating plant water hyacinth was introduced in the bioreactor at stage ii to explore the influence of the floating plant on the performance of ufcw mfc supplementary aeration was then introduced at stage iii and lastly the bioreactor was operated in open circuit at stage iv to explore the effect of aeration and circuit connection on the performance of ufcw mfc this study was operated for 90 days where 15 26 29 and 20 days were operated for stages i ii iii and iv respectively the operation sequence and the entire operation period were summarised in table 1 water hyacinth eichhornia crassipes was selected as the floating plant used in this study it was acquired from tasik melati perlis e crassipes with around 200 g was planted in the cathodic region of the bioreactor the mass of e crassipes was measured throughout the study to monitor the growth of the plant in this system air sparger was placed below the cathode 49 cm from the bottom of the bioreactor as supplementary aeration in stages iii and iv synthetic wastewater was fed to the bioreactors by a peristaltic pump huiyu bt100j 1a china at a flow rate of 4 603 ml min and operated in continuous mode with a hydraulic retention time of 1 day the synthetic wastewater consists of 409 8 mg l ch3coona 214 2 mg l c6h5coona 176 1 mg l nh4no3 36 7 mg l k2hpo4 7 0 mg l nacl 3 4 mg l mgcl2 6h2o and 4 0 mg l cacl2 2h2o 2 2 analysis wastewater was collected from influent and all sampling points s1 s2 s3 s4 and s5 to evaluate the wastewater treatment performance in ufcw mfc the samples collected were analyzed for dissolved oxygen do oxidation reduction potential orp chemical oxidation demand cod ammonium ion nh4 and nitrate ion no3 do and orp were measured by using do meter hanna hi 9146 usa and orp probe with platinum electrode ag agcl reference connected to an orp meter hanna hi 8424 usa respectively hach dr 2800 colorimeter was used to analyze the concentration of cod a tabletop low speed centrifuge cence l500 china was used to centrifuge the water samples at 4200 rpm for 10 min before cod analysis analysis of ammonium and nitrate were carried out using martini instrument mi 151 ph orp temperature bench meter and bante instruments 920 precision ph orp meter respectively polarization curve was carried out to determine the power density and internal resistance of the system kinetic study on the cod removal was analyzed with pseudo zero order pseudo first order and pseudo second order to study the effect of floating plant supplementary aeration and circuit connection on the degradation of the organic matter 2 3 calculation the cod removal efficiency was calculated by using eq 1 1 co d r c in c out c in 100 where cin is the cod concentration of influent and cout is the cod concentration of effluent mg l the volumetric power density was calculated by using eq 2 2 p d v i v where v is

significance of wastewater treatment performance in cw mfc between the operating parameters floating plant supplementary aeration and circuit connection tukey kramer method was further carried out as the post hoc test to identify the significant differences between the specific operating parameters 15 p value 0 05 indicates that there is a significant difference between the operating parameters while p value 0 05 indicates that there is no significant difference between the operating parameters 3 result and discussion 3 1 dissolved oxygen do and oxidation reduction potential orp profile along ufcw mfc bioreactor dissolved oxygen do and oxidation reduction potential orp were monitored throughout the study to distinguish the aerobic and anaerobic regions in the ufcw mfc bioreactor do and orp are crucial parameters in ufcw mfc as they influence the pollutant removal and energy recovery in the hybrid system 3 in cw oxygen is required for organic matter degradation and nitrification 16 on the other hand oxygen is mainly acted as an electron acceptor in mfc to produce electricity the redox gradient between anode and cathode also greatly affect the bioelectricity generation in the mfc 17 in this study the influence of floating plant aeration and circuit connection on the do and orp were investigated fig 2 a and b exhibit the do and orp profiles along the ufcw mfc bioreactor the results showed that anaerobic condition was established along the whole wetland bed for non planted stage i and planted stage ii bioreactors do of stage i and stage ii were in the range of 0 42 0 88 mg l and 0 36 1 05 mg l respectively from s1 s5 while orp for both stages was in the range of 168 45 to 43 30 mv the higher do level of planted ufcw mfc stage ii at s5 compared with non planted ufcw mfc stage i indicated that e crassipes released oxygen to the bioreactor through the radial oxygen loss rol rol is a phenomenon of wetland plant roots releasing oxygen through the aerenchyma to the rhizosphere 18 patil et al 19 reported a similar result where the do level increased after treatment using e crassipes as macrophyte in cw in the absence of supplementary aeration oxygen was only supplied through the diffusion from the atmosphere and released by roots of the plant via rol the low supply and high usage of oxygen in s5 caused the do concentration low at s5 the diffusion of oxygen into s3 occurred when supplementary aeration stage iii and iv was supplied into the bioreactor do and orp at s3 was higher when the supplementary aeration was introduced compared to stage i and ii the effect of air diffusion into s3 on nitrification denitrification and bioelectricity generation will be further discussed in the following part the aerobic region was developed at sampling point s4 and s5 in aerated ufcw mfc stage iii and open circuit ufcw mfc stage iv do and orp were in the range of 4 87 5 63 mg l and 119 05 125 5 mv respectively at s4 s5 for the aerated ufcw mfc stage iii the increment was mainly contributed by the supplementary aeration provided by the aerator which located below the sampling point s4 do and orp in open circuit ufcw mfc stage iv were in the range of 5 02 6 00 mg l and 168 55 171 30 mv respectively at s4 and s5 higher do concentration and orp in open circuit ufcw mfc stage iv were found at s4 and s5 compared to aerated ufcw mfc stage iii which is in closed circuit system this might due to the distinct mechanism of oxygen consumption in open circuit and closed circuit system at the cathode oxygen consumption in the open circuit only involved aerobic reactions such as degradation of organic matter and nitrification while in closed circuit oxygen was used for the treatment of wastewater as well as involved in the half cell reaction of mfc which is acted as electron acceptor for electricity generation 20 21 thus the do and orp in aerated ufcw mfc closed circuit were lower than open circuit ufcw mfc due to more do consumption 3 2 plant monitoring wetland plant is one of the important characteristics in cw as it plays several roles such as provide filtering effects increase surface area for microbial growth uptake of nutrients and release oxygen from roots 8 emergent plants such as common reed and water spinach were commonly used in previous cw mfc studies however there are limited studies on cw mfc using floating plants as macrophytes to evaluate the performance of cw mfc on wastewater treatment as well as bioelectricity generation therefore a floating plant was employed in this study to provide some references on the contribution of floating plant on the performance of ufcw mfc e crassipes is well known as free floating macrophyte that has tremendous capability in removing biochemical oxygen demand bod cod nitrogen phosphorus organic carbon suspended solids phenols pesticides heavy metals etc from wastewater 22 therefore e crassipes was selected as the floating plant in this study to explore the influence of floating plant on wastewater treatment and bioelectricity generation in ufcw mfc fig 3 depicts the development of the plant in the ufcw mfc bioreactor throughout the study it was found that the mass of e crassipes increased slightly in the first 30 days and then increased sharply from day 45 90 it was also observed that some of the leaves turn yellowish at the early stage after e crassipes was planted into ufcw mfc bioreactor which indicated that the plant was adapting to the change of environment the positive and rapid growth rate in terms of the mass showed that the plant was well acclimatized in the system with synthetic wastewater clogging is widely known as one of the major problems in cws 23 24 it is mainly caused by the precipitation retention of organic inorganic particles root system growth and biofilm formation 25 from the perspective of macrophytes roots of emergent plants could contribute to the clogging problem in cw as the roots are attached to the media which may reduce the void space and cause clogging in cw upon growing over long term operation besides it complicates the cleaning and maintenance process of cw as the roots are difficult to be removed similarly submersed macrophytes also rooted in the media and they may modify flows in moving water when they become too abundant floating plants are the better choice to be employed in cw in terms of clogging problem as the roots of floating plants are mostly floating in the water column this reduces the possibility of clogging problem due to root system growth in addition floating plants can be easily removed and placed back to the bioreactor during and after the cleaning and maintenance process e crassipes is also notable for its rapid growth rate and extensive root system which make it a promising candidate for phytoremediation of polluted water 26 3 3 wastewater treatment performance in ufcw mfc system 3 3 1 cod removal the average cod concentration of synthetic wastewater used in this study was 683 mg l table 2 outlined the wastewater treatment performance and fig 4 demonstrates the cod removal in ufcw mfc as shown in fig 4 a the cod removal efficiency was consistent throughout the study this showed that the system was in stable condition the organic matter containing in the synthetic wastewater was mainly reduced by the microbial activity carried out in the aerobic and anaerobic region of the bioreactor 27 fig 4 b shows that there is a sudden decrease in cod concentration from influent to sampling point s1 followed by uniform decrement from s1 to s2 and s3 the result indicated that most of the cod reduction occurred in the anaerobic region which contributed to 92 96 of total cod removal efficiency carbon sources in the wastewater were oxidized by the anaerobic microbes as the fuel to support their growth and activity 28 as a result cod concentration was greatly reduced in the anodic region the unutilized organic substrate was further degraded in the aerobic region s4 and s5 by the aerobes when the supplementary aeration was provided to the bioreactor the total cod removal efficiency for non planted stage i planted stage ii aerated stage iii and open circuit stage iv ufcw mfc were 95 97 99 and 98 respectively according to anova there was a statistically significant difference between the four stages for the total cod removal p 0 05 the turkey post hoc test was performed by forming six groups of pairing among the four stages non planted planted non planted aerated non planted open circuit planted aerated planted open circuit aerated open circuit to identify the significant differences between the specific operating parameters the main pairings used for the comparison were non planted planted effect of floating plant planted aerated effect of supplementary aeration aerated open circuit effect of circuit connection the tukey post hoc test revealed that there was a statistically significant difference for all six groups of pairing p 0 05 this showed that the effect of floating plant supplementary aeration and circuit connection on the organic matter degradation in ufcw mfc were statistically significant the non planted planted pairing showed that e crassipes enhanced the total cod removal in cw mfc the improvement of cod removal might be due to the plant rhizosphere provide carbon source through root exudates for microbial growth besides leakage of oxygen from the root of the plant to the adjacent microenvironment also promoted the growth of aerobic microbes and thus improved the organic matter reduction 29 in this study the improvement of total cod removal by the supplementary aeration was not obvious because most of the organic matter was degraded in the anodic region at the bottom of the bioreactor the supplementary aeration was though significantly enhanced the total cod removal from the statistical perspective which could be due to the aerobic biodegradation the effect of the floating plant supplementary aeration and circuit connection was further investigated by comparing the cod removal at sampling point s1 anaerobic region as shown in fig 4 b the cod removal of the planted bioreactor stage ii was 2 better than non planted bioreactor stage i while the aerated bioreactor stage iii was performed 9 better than planted bioreactor stage ii and 6 better than open circuit bioreactor stage iv at s1 similarly the anova showed that there was a significant difference between the operating parameters and the turkey post hoc test was conducted as mentioned previously for cod removal at s1 the results revealed that there was no significant difference between the non planted planted and planted open circuit pairings p 0 05 while there was a significant difference for another four pairings p 0 05 the insignificant difference between non planted planted paring indicated that the effect of floating plant on the cod removal at the anaerobic region was not obvious oon et al 21 reported that the electron transfer enhanced the biodegradation of organic substrate and consequently increase the removal efficiency of cod hence the insignificant difference between non planted planted paring could be due to the lack of oxygen supplied by the floating plant at the cathode to facilitate the transfer of electrons from the anode to cathode this can be further supported by comparing it with the planted aerated pairing the significant difference between planted aerated pairing could be owing to the increase of the electron transfer rate which was corresponding to the increase of do through the supplementary aeration at the cathode as a result the cod removal efficiency at s1 was greatly improved from stage ii to stage iii the significant difference between aerated open circuit indicated that closed circuit statistically significantly enhanced the cod removal compared to open circuit in closed circuit anode could act as the terminal electron acceptor to increase the metabolic rates of anaerobic bacteria 30 this could accelerate the conversion of substrates to produce more electrons and consequently enhanced the cod removal at s1 furthermore closed circuit could promote the growth of electrogenic bacteria which could also stimulate the biodegradation of organic matters fang et al 20 and srivastava et al 31 reported a similar result where closed circuit performed 12 and 12 20 better than open circuit respectively the planted open circuit pairing revealed the relationship between aeration and circuit connection on the cod removal at s1 planted bioreactor stage ii was operated in closed circuit and without aeration while open circuit bioreactor stage iv was operated in open circuit with supplementary aeration the insignificant difference between this pairing indicated that the supplementary aeration and closed circuit connection will only greatly enhanced the cod removal at the anaerobic region when the bioreactor was operated in closed circuit with supplementary aeration this can be supported by comparing with planted aerated and aerated open circuit pairings which both pairings showed aerated bioreactor stage iii statistically significantly improve the biodegradation of organic matters at s1 compared to planted stage ii and open circuit stage iv bioreactors in addition the kinetic study on the cod removal was conducted to compare the performance of cod removal between the four stages the reaction rate constant k and regression coefficient values r2 of the cod removal are presented in table 3 the high regression coefficient values show that the removal of cod was best fitted to the pseudo second order kinetic model this result is agreed with the outcome from sarioglu and bisgin 32 who investigated the kinetic behaviour of the degradation of co substrate glucose and maxilon yellow gl using anaerobic mixed culture they observed the cod degradation for dye free control samples followed the pseudo second order kinetic the results indicated that cod degradation through the microbial activities occurred via pseudo second order kinetic the cod removal rate constant was ranked in decreasing order of stages iii iv ii i stage iii showed the highest cod degradation kinetic rate constant 0 0047 l mg h which was 1 3 times higher than stage iv 0 0035 l mg h 1 9 times higher than stage ii 0 0025 l mg h and 2 8 times higher than stage i 0 0017 l mg h overall the results suggested the operating conditions of stage iii was the best in term of cod removal it is expected that a more significant difference can be observed when a higher strength of organic wastewater was introduced to the system the inoculated gravel and activated carbon that placed inside the ufcw mfc bioreactor allowed the anaerobic and aerobic microbes to attach and grow on the media consequently the accumulation and growth of microbes contributed to the high cod removal efficiency activated carbon served as a good medium for the attachment of microbes because of its large surface area and helpful capillary water absorption 33 besides bioregeneration also enhanced the degradation of organic matter by microorganisms bioregeneration is known as the restoration of the adsorptive capacity of activated carbon by microorganisms for further adsorption bioregeneration occurs as a result of a concentration gradient between the carbon and the bulk liquid 34 oon et al 21 reported that the use of activated carbon as electrodes improved the cod removal at the anaerobic region compared to carbon cloth the study of liu et al 33 also demonstrated that activated carbon promoted bacterial adhesion and colonization better than carbon cloth the results indicated that the medium used for attachment of microbes play an important role in cod reduction as the larger microbial attachment could lead to better performance on organic matter degradation 3 3 2 ammonium and nitrate ions removal nitrogen removal from wastewater was mainly contributed by the nitrification and denitrification process both nitrification and denitrification process are highly dependent on the do as the nitrification process favoured to be occurred at aerobic condition whereas the denitrification process only takes place at anaerobic anoxic condition ammonium and nitrate profiles along the wetland bed were analyzed to evaluate the effect of different operating conditions on nitrogen removal in ufcw mfc as shown in table 2 the ammonium removal efficiency was only 29 and 39 for non planted stage i and planted bioreactor stage ii respectively the low removal efficiency was due to the low do concentration in the non planted stage i and planted bioreactor stage ii as the nitrification process favoured to happen in the aerobic condition the ammonium removal between non planted and planted bioreactor was statistically significant p 0 05 this was because e crassipes could uptake nutrients to support the growth as well as release oxygen to the water through the roots which can enhance the growth of nitrifying bacteria and improve the ammonium reduction 22 on the other hand 96 of ammonium removal was obtained when supplementary aeration was introduced into the aerated stage iii and open circuit stage iv bioreactors this demonstrated that supplementary aeration could promote the nitrification process and enhanced the oxidation of ammonium by the nitrifying bacteria in the cathodic region fig 5 a shows there is a sharp decline of ammonium concentration in s3 which was due to the air diffusion from the aerator located at s4 generally the reduction efficiency of ammonium was corresponding to the do profile fig 2 in the nitrification process there are basically two oxidation steps involved the oxidation of ammonium ion nh4 to nitrite no2 is first carried out by the ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob the intermediate no2 is then oxidized by nitrobacter species to nitrate no3 14 therefore the bioreactor with supplementary aeration showed higher ammonium removal as oxygen is required in the nitrification process there is no significant difference between the closed and open circuits in ammonium removal p 0 05 this could be due to the low concentration of ammonium was introduced into the bioreactor as most of the ammonium was almost completely oxidized in both closed and open circuit operation in this study the results suggested that the significance of operating parameters on the ammonium removal was ranked in decreasing order of supplementary aeration plant circuit connection denitrification occurs when oxygen levels are depleted and nitrate is acted as the electron acceptor for the anaerobic respiration of denitrifiers 35 in the denitrification process denitrifiers such as pseudomonas species break apart nitrate to obtain oxygen and reduce nitrate to nitrogen no3 no2 n2o n2 in anaerobic anoxic condition fig 5 b depicts that high removal efficiency of nitrate 89 and 84 was observed in the non planted stage i and planted stage ii bioreactors respectively this is because the whole wetland bed of non planted and planted bioreactors was almost in anaerobic conditions as there is no supplementary aeration supplied to the bioreactor the nitrate removal between non planted and planted bioreactors was not significant p 0 05 the higher nitrate residual in the planted bioreactor stage ii compared with non planted stage i may be due to the stimulation of nitrifying bacteria to proceed the nitrification process as a result of oxygen leakage from the roots 6 similarly the nitrate removal in aerated stage iii and open circuit stage iv bioreactors was low since supplementary aeration inhibits the denitrification process besides the increase of nitrate concentration at the effluent was corresponding to the reduction of ammonium as the nitrification produced nitrate ion at the end of the process turkey post hoc test revealed that supplementary aeration significantly affected the denitrification process p 0 05 while there was no significant difference between aerated and open circuit bioreactors p 0 05 the nitrate removal in the open circuit was though tested significantly higher at the anaerobic region sampling point s2 compared with the closed circuit p 0 05 this could be due to the competition of electrons for electricity generation and denitrification in the closed circuit on the other hand nitrate could be acted as the electron acceptor in the open circuit and subsequently improve the nitrate removal in the anaerobic region of ufcw mfc 3 4 bioelectricity generation in ufcw mfc system 3 4 1 voltage output and power density the bioelectricity generation performance of ufcw mfc was evaluated through the monitoring of voltage output and power densities three anodes were embedded in the bioreactor to investigate the influence of electrode spacing on the energy produced from the hybrid system the distance between the cathode and the three anodes was 15 cm c a1 30 cm c a2 and 45 cm c a3 respectively the voltage output of three anodes in different operating conditions are shown in fig 6 a and table 4 generally the smallest electrode spacing c a1 demonstrated the highest voltage output for stage i and ii which recorded an average of 47 5 2 9 mv and 79 9 9 2 mv respectively the result indicated that voltage increase with the decrease of electrode spacing 36 37 when supplementary aeration was introduced to the bioreactor in stage iii the voltage at c a1 was initially increased sharply but showed decrement after 10 days of operation this may be due to the diffusion of oxygen from the supplementary aeration into the anode a1 and decrease the potential difference between anode and cathode which is crucial in producing electricity in mfc 38 as a result c a2 with larger electrode spacing performed better than c a1 and recorded an average voltage output of 291 44 2 mv oon et al 21 found a similar result where the voltage output of the smallest electrode spacing was the lowest in the study due to the air diffusion into the anodic region as shown in table 4 the voltage output of planted bioreactor stage ii was 1 7 3 3 and 3 6 folds higher than the non planted bioreactor stage i for three different electrode spacing c a1 c a2 and c a3 respectively the increase of voltage output from stage i to stage ii indicated that e crassipes contributes to electricity generation this could be due to the increase of do concentration at cathode through the leakage of oxygen from the roots of the plant 14 since there was more electron acceptor o2 in the planted bioreactor stage ii hence more o2 was ready to accept the electrons from the anode to produce electricity and contribute to a higher voltage output the power densities of c a1 was the highest followed by c a2 and c a3 in stage i and ii as shown in table 4 a similar trend of power densities was obtained in the internal resistance the internal resistance of both stages i and ii were 200 620 and 620 ω for c a1 c a2 and c a3 respectively this suggested that smaller electrode spacing reduced the internal resistance and improved the power density produced by the ufcw mfc system 39 fig 6 b depicts the power density observed at different operating conditions in the bioreactor the power density obtained in the aerated bioreactor stage iii was the highest compared to the planted stage ii and non planted stage i bioreactors which was 45 46 3 83 6 00 0 11 and 1 55 0 18 mw m3 respectively the internal resistance was reduced from 620 to 500 ω which could contribute to higher electricity production oxygen served as the electron acceptor in mfc to complete the circuit to produce electricity supplementary aeration and oxygen leakage from the floating plant to the cathode have increased the potential difference between the cathode and anodes the presence of a strong electron acceptor and the increment of electron acceptor concentration could enhance the electron transfer rate and contribute to energy production 40 41 as a result the power density generated in the aerated bioreactor stage iii was the highest followed by planted stage ii and lastly non planted stage i bioreactors due to the difference in the concentration of do as the electron acceptor 3 4 2 coulombic efficiency and normalized energy recovery in order to evaluate the energy recovery from wastewater coulombic efficiency ce defined as the ratio of electrons that is contributed to the electricity generation from the degradation of organic substrate was calculated and shown in fig 6 c and table 4 the ce was the highest when the electrode spacing was the smallest c a1 in all three stages this could be due to low cod residual at that region and more organic substrate was converted to the electric current the results suggested that ce can be enhanced by smaller electrode spacing 42 aerated bioreactor stage iii showed the highest ce followed by planted stage ii and non planted stage i bioreactors the ce increased from 0 24 at stage i to 0 58 at stage ii and finally increased to 2 15 at stage iii the vast difference between these three stages was mainly due to the presence of oxygen as the electron acceptor more oxygen was available at the cathodic region of the planted stage ii and aerated stage iii bioreactors and this increased the electron transfer rate from anode to cathode as a result more electrons were used for electricity generation and contribute to a higher ce the results indicated that both plant and supplementary aeration play an important role in bioenergy recovery the ce obtained in this study was relatively high compared with other cw mfc studies as shown in table 5 but was considerably low when compared to mfcs low ce was obtained in the hybrid system because only a small fraction of organic matter degraded was converted to the generation of electricity the consumption of substrates for processes such as fermentation and methanogenesis rather than cell synthesis by electrogenic bacteria could also result in low ce 10 besides nitrate also acts as an electron acceptor in the denitrification process denitrifiers such as pseudomonas that exist in the system could compete with electrogenic bacteria for the electrons produced from the degradation of organic matter oon et al 4 reported that the ability of nitrate as the electron acceptor is stronger compared to the anode in the anodic region this indicated that more electrons were used for denitrification compared to electricity generation the low ratio of electrode area to bioreactor volume could also result in the low ce in the hybrid system 33 debabov 43 also indicated that only certain microbes in the population contributed to the production of electricity therefore low ce obtained in this study might due to the mass diversity microorganisms exist in the ufcw mfc as mixed cultures sludge was used for inoculation in this study normalized energy recovery ner was calculated to analyze energy recovery from the removal of substrates ners and the volume of treated wastewater nerv 44 ners obtained in this study was relatively high compared to other cw mfc studies table 5 this could be due to the difference in design plant aeration substrate concentration and electrode material ners showed a similar trend as ce in terms of electrode spacing where both ce and ners decrease as the electrode spacing increase on the other hand nerv demonstrated a slight difference trend from ce and ners the highest nerv was found at c a2 0 31 wh m3 followed by c a3 0 24 wh m3 and c a1 0 16 wh m3 since nerv does not account for the cod removal in the system thus air diffusion into c a1 has greatly decreased the electricity generation and lowered the nerv these results indicated that electricity generation and energy recovery can be enhanced by introduced the plant and supplementary aeration as well as reduced the electrode spacing 4 conclusion this study shows the importance of the floating plant aeration and closed circuit connection on the wastewater treatment performance and electricity generation do level in the cathodic region could be enhanced by the floating plant and supplementary aeration which leads to better removal of ammonium as well as increase the electron acceptor concentration for higher bioelectricity generation closed circuit connection enhanced the degradation of organic matter as it promotes the growth of electrogenic bacteria and the transfer of electrons also aided in the biodegradation of organic pollutants the performance of ufcw mfc was most significantly affected by supplementary aeration compared to floating plant and circuit connection overall

14021,the influence of floating plant eichhornia crassipes supplementary aeration and circuit connection on wastewater treatment performance and electricity production using up flow constructed wetland microbial fuel cell ufcw mfc were investigated in this study this study was operated for four stages where stage i was conducted without plant and aeration stage ii was planted with eichhornia crassipes supplementary aeration was provided in stage iii stage iv was operated in open circuit the supplementary aeration showed the most significant effect on the performance of ufcw mfc compared to floating plant and circuit connection the optimum performance of wastewater treatment and electricity production was found in stage iii as the oxygen was supplied by the floating plant and supplementary aeration for the degradation of organic matters as well as the generation of bioelectricity the chemical oxygen demand cod nh4 and no3 removal efficiencies were 99 96 and 44 respectively e crassipes and supplementary aeration improved the dissolved oxygen do concentration at the cathodic region and enhanced the nh4 removal by 10 stage ii and 67 stage iii compared to the non planted bioreactor stage i closed circuit also performed 6 better than open circuit at sampling point 1 s1 in cod reduction the maximum power density voltage output coulombic efficiency and normalized energy

wastewater treatment 1 introduction energy shortage and water pollution are two major global problems faced by human beings nowadays water is required by all living things to survive as well as energy production on the other hand energy is needed for wastewater treatment and water purification the current method used for energy generation is unsustainable for human need and pollution control as the energy demand keeps increasing due to the increase in population and most of the pollution control is high energy consuming hence researches have been driven to explore more sustainable technology to solve both problems simultaneously 1 4 constructed wetland cw is an engineered system that has been developed for many years as one of the methods to purify wastewater by using the natural process and the treatment process includes physical chemical and microbial activities 5 cw is favourable to be used as the treatment process of wastewater due to the low cost in construction and maintenance 6 as well as the capability of treating a wide range of wastewater such as municipal wastewaters industrial and agricultural wastewaters landfill leachate and stormwater runoff 7 macrophytes also play an important role in the constructed wetland such as provide large surface area for microbial attachment and growth provide a good condition for physical filtration and stabilize the surface beds besides oxygen is also released and transferred by the plants through the root system which is needed to improve the organic matter degradation and nitrification process 8 microbial fuel cell mfc is an advanced technology that has drawn a lot of interest from scientists and researchers as it showed great potential in converting organic matters into bioelectricity through the microbial activities 9 mfc consists of an anode which acts as a negative terminal and a cathode which acts as the positive terminal 10 the substrates in the wastewater are utilized by electrogenic bacteria for the metabolic activities to generate electrons at the anode an external circuit was provided for the electrons to flow from anode to cathode to generate electricity 11 oxygen an electron acceptor is then reacted with the electrons transferred from the anode at the cathode to produce water and another reduced compound 12 hybrid system of cw and mfc cw mfc is a treatment system that embeds the cathode and anode of mfc in cw similarities between cws and mfcs have driven the combination of these two systems both cws and mfcs are utilizing microorganisms in the degradation of organic matter moreover the redox gradient an anaerobic anode and aerobic cathode which is required for the operation of mfcs can be obtained naturally in cws based on flow direction and depth of wetland 1 most of the cw mfc systems were operated in an up flow condition where the anode is buried and the cathode is exposed to the surface or rhizosphere of the plant this is because upflowed cw mfc ufcw mfc is capable to maximize the redox gradient in the system which is an important factor that contributes to electricity production from the system 3 in ufcw mfc the bottom bed of the system is used as anodic chamber which is in anaerobic environment while the upper bed is in aerobic environment where mineralization of aromatic amines nitrification and further degradation of unutilized organic matter from the lower region occurred 13 the individual weakness of cw and mfc could be enhanced and improved by the hybrid system of cw and mfc several studies on the role of plants aeration and circuit connection on the performance of cw mfc have been conducted separately but there is limited study on the comparison and optimization of these three operating parameters furthermore most of the cw mfc studies were using the emergent and submerged plant as the macrophytes in the studies while there is a lack of study on the implementation of floating plant in cw mfc to the best of the authors knowledge there are also limited studies on the kinetic in cw mfc thus the main aims of this study are to explore the role of floating plant as well as the influence of aeration and circuit connection on the wastewater treatment and electricity production in up flow constructed wetland microbial fuel cell ufcw mfc comparison and optimization of these operating parameters were conducted through the statistical analysis and kinetic study to further investigate the significance of these operating parameters on the performance of cw mfc 2 materials and methods 2 1 ufcw mfc setup and operation as shown in fig 1 the bioreactor was constructed using an acrylic column with an internal diameter of 17 5 cm and a height of 75 cm the bioreactor was placed outdoor at an average temperature of 29 3 c glass beads average diameter of 1 cm were placed at the bottom of the bioreactor up to 3 cm to develop a uniform flow of wastewater gravel average diameter of 0 6 cm was used as supporting medium and granular activated carbon was served as the anode and cathode in this ufcw mfc system five sampling points were designed along the bioreactor at the 7 21 36 51 and 66 cm from the bottom of the wetland bed 14 three layers of anode were developed to study the influence of electrode spacing on the electricity generation in ufcw mfc three anodes were embedded at 8 cm 23 cm and 38 cm while cathode was placed at 53 cm from the bottom of the bioreactor each layer of anodes and cathode was made of 2405 59 cm3 of activated carbon a mixed culture sludge was obtained from the wastewater treatment plant of shorubber malaysia sdn bhd and used for the inoculation of activated carbon and gravels for a month before transferred into the bioreactor the connection between anodes and cathode was carried out by using insulated copper wires carbon rod stainless steel and resistor with an external resistance of 1000 ω a data logger midi logger gl820 graphtec was connected to the bioreactor to record the voltage output of the bioreactor the bioreactor was operated in four stages to investigate the effect of the floating plant aeration and circuit connection on the performance of ufcw mfc at stage i the bioreactor was operated without plant and aeration after the system reached the stable condition a floating plant water hyacinth was introduced in the bioreactor at stage ii to explore the influence of the floating plant on the performance of ufcw mfc supplementary aeration was then introduced at stage iii and lastly the bioreactor was operated in open circuit at stage iv to explore the effect of aeration and circuit connection on the performance of ufcw mfc this study was operated for 90 days where 15 26 29 and 20 days were operated for stages i ii iii and iv respectively the operation sequence and the entire operation period were summarised in table 1 water hyacinth eichhornia crassipes was selected as the floating plant used in this study it was acquired from tasik melati perlis e crassipes with around 200 g was planted in the cathodic region of the bioreactor the mass of e crassipes was measured throughout the study to monitor the growth of the plant in this system air sparger was placed below the cathode 49 cm from the bottom of the bioreactor as supplementary aeration in stages iii and iv synthetic wastewater was fed to the bioreactors by a peristaltic pump huiyu bt100j 1a china at a flow rate of 4 603 ml min and operated in continuous mode with a hydraulic retention time of 1 day the synthetic wastewater consists of 409 8 mg l ch3coona 214 2 mg l c6h5coona 176 1 mg l nh4no3 36 7 mg l k2hpo4 7 0 mg l nacl 3 4 mg l mgcl2 6h2o and 4 0 mg l cacl2 2h2o 2 2 analysis wastewater was collected from influent and all sampling points s1 s2 s3 s4 and s5 to evaluate the wastewater treatment performance in ufcw mfc the samples collected were analyzed for dissolved oxygen do oxidation reduction potential orp chemical oxidation demand cod ammonium ion nh4 and nitrate ion no3 do and orp were measured by using do meter hanna hi 9146 usa and orp probe with platinum electrode ag agcl reference connected to an orp meter hanna hi 8424 usa respectively hach dr 2800 colorimeter was used to analyze the concentration of cod a tabletop low speed centrifuge cence l500 china was used to centrifuge the water samples at 4200 rpm for 10 min before cod analysis analysis of ammonium and nitrate were carried out using martini instrument mi 151 ph orp temperature bench meter and bante instruments 920 precision ph orp meter respectively polarization curve was carried out to determine the power density and internal resistance of the system kinetic study on the cod removal was analyzed with pseudo zero order pseudo first order and pseudo second order to study the effect of floating plant supplementary aeration and circuit connection on the degradation of the organic matter 2 3 calculation the cod removal efficiency was calculated by using eq 1 1 co d r c in c out c in 100 where cin is the cod concentration of influent and cout is the cod concentration of effluent mg l the volumetric power density was calculated by using eq 2 2 p d v i v where v is

significance of wastewater treatment performance in cw mfc between the operating parameters floating plant supplementary aeration and circuit connection tukey kramer method was further carried out as the post hoc test to identify the significant differences between the specific operating parameters 15 p value 0 05 indicates that there is a significant difference between the operating parameters while p value 0 05 indicates that there is no significant difference between the operating parameters 3 result and discussion 3 1 dissolved oxygen do and oxidation reduction potential orp profile along ufcw mfc bioreactor dissolved oxygen do and oxidation reduction potential orp were monitored throughout the study to distinguish the aerobic and anaerobic regions in the ufcw mfc bioreactor do and orp are crucial parameters in ufcw mfc as they influence the pollutant removal and energy recovery in the hybrid system 3 in cw oxygen is required for organic matter degradation and nitrification 16 on the other hand oxygen is mainly acted as an electron acceptor in mfc to produce electricity the redox gradient between anode and cathode also greatly affect the bioelectricity generation in the mfc 17 in this study the influence of floating plant aeration and circuit connection on the do and orp were investigated fig 2 a and b exhibit the do and orp profiles along the ufcw mfc bioreactor the results showed that anaerobic condition was established along the whole wetland bed for non planted stage i and planted stage ii bioreactors do of stage i and stage ii were in the range of 0 42 0 88 mg l and 0 36 1 05 mg l respectively from s1 s5 while orp for both stages was in the range of 168 45 to 43 30 mv the higher do level of planted ufcw mfc stage ii at s5 compared with non planted ufcw mfc stage i indicated that e crassipes released oxygen to the bioreactor through the radial oxygen loss rol rol is a phenomenon of wetland plant roots releasing oxygen through the aerenchyma to the rhizosphere 18 patil et al 19 reported a similar result where the do level increased after treatment using e crassipes as macrophyte in cw in the absence of supplementary aeration oxygen was only supplied through the diffusion from the atmosphere and released by roots of the plant via rol the low supply and high usage of oxygen in s5 caused the do concentration low at s5 the diffusion of oxygen into s3 occurred when supplementary aeration stage iii and iv was supplied into the bioreactor do and orp at s3 was higher when the supplementary aeration was introduced compared to stage i and ii the effect of air diffusion into s3 on nitrification denitrification and bioelectricity generation will be further discussed in the following part the aerobic region was developed at sampling point s4 and s5 in aerated ufcw mfc stage iii and open circuit ufcw mfc stage iv do and orp were in the range of 4 87 5 63 mg l and 119 05 125 5 mv respectively at s4 s5 for the aerated ufcw mfc stage iii the increment was mainly contributed by the supplementary aeration provided by the aerator which located below the sampling point s4 do and orp in open circuit ufcw mfc stage iv were in the range of 5 02 6 00 mg l and 168 55 171 30 mv respectively at s4 and s5 higher do concentration and orp in open circuit ufcw mfc stage iv were found at s4 and s5 compared to aerated ufcw mfc stage iii which is in closed circuit system this might due to the distinct mechanism of oxygen consumption in open circuit and closed circuit system at the cathode oxygen consumption in the open circuit only involved aerobic reactions such as degradation of organic matter and nitrification while in closed circuit oxygen was used for the treatment of wastewater as well as involved in the half cell reaction of mfc which is acted as electron acceptor for electricity generation 20 21 thus the do and orp in aerated ufcw mfc closed circuit were lower than open circuit ufcw mfc due to more do consumption 3 2 plant monitoring wetland plant is one of the important characteristics in cw as it plays several roles such as provide filtering effects increase surface area for microbial growth uptake of nutrients and release oxygen from roots 8 emergent plants such as common reed and water spinach were commonly used in previous cw mfc studies however there are limited studies on cw mfc using floating plants as macrophytes to evaluate the performance of cw mfc on wastewater treatment as well as bioelectricity generation therefore a floating plant was employed in this study to provide some references on the contribution of floating plant on the performance of ufcw mfc e crassipes is well known as free floating macrophyte that has tremendous capability in removing biochemical oxygen demand bod cod nitrogen phosphorus organic carbon suspended solids phenols pesticides heavy metals etc from wastewater 22 therefore e crassipes was selected as the floating plant in this study to explore the influence of floating plant on wastewater treatment and bioelectricity generation in ufcw mfc fig 3 depicts the development of the plant in the ufcw mfc bioreactor throughout the study it was found that the mass of e crassipes increased slightly in the first 30 days and then increased sharply from day 45 90 it was also observed that some of the leaves turn yellowish at the early stage after e crassipes was planted into ufcw mfc bioreactor which indicated that the plant was adapting to the change of environment the positive and rapid growth rate in terms of the mass showed that the plant was well acclimatized in the system with synthetic wastewater clogging is widely known as one of the major problems in cws 23 24 it is mainly caused by the precipitation retention of organic inorganic particles root system growth and biofilm formation 25 from the perspective of macrophytes roots of emergent plants could contribute to the clogging problem in cw as the roots are attached to the media which may reduce the void space and cause clogging in cw upon growing over long term operation besides it complicates the cleaning and maintenance process of cw as the roots are difficult to be removed similarly submersed macrophytes also rooted in the media and they may modify flows in moving water when they become too abundant floating plants are the better choice to be employed in cw in terms of clogging problem as the roots of floating plants are mostly floating in the water column this reduces the possibility of clogging problem due to root system growth in addition floating plants can be easily removed and placed back to the bioreactor during and after the cleaning and maintenance process e crassipes is also notable for its rapid growth rate and extensive root system which make it a promising candidate for phytoremediation of polluted water 26 3 3 wastewater treatment performance in ufcw mfc system 3 3 1 cod removal the average cod concentration of synthetic wastewater used in this study was 683 mg l table 2 outlined the wastewater treatment performance and fig 4 demonstrates the cod removal in ufcw mfc as shown in fig 4 a the cod removal efficiency was consistent throughout the study this showed that the system was in stable condition the organic matter containing in the synthetic wastewater was mainly reduced by the microbial activity carried out in the aerobic and anaerobic region of the bioreactor 27 fig 4 b shows that there is a sudden decrease in cod concentration from influent to sampling point s1 followed by uniform decrement from s1 to s2 and s3 the result indicated that most of the cod reduction occurred in the anaerobic region which contributed to 92 96 of total cod removal efficiency carbon sources in the wastewater were oxidized by the anaerobic microbes as the fuel to support their growth and activity 28 as a result cod concentration was greatly reduced in the anodic region the unutilized organic substrate was further degraded in the aerobic region s4 and s5 by the aerobes when the supplementary aeration was provided to the bioreactor the total cod removal efficiency for non planted stage i planted stage ii aerated stage iii and open circuit stage iv ufcw mfc were 95 97 99 and 98 respectively according to anova there was a statistically significant difference between the four stages for the total cod removal p 0 05 the turkey post hoc test was performed by forming six groups of pairing among the four stages non planted planted non planted aerated non planted open circuit planted aerated planted open circuit aerated open circuit to identify the significant differences between the specific operating parameters the main pairings used for the comparison were non planted planted effect of floating plant planted aerated effect of supplementary aeration aerated open circuit effect of circuit connection the tukey post hoc test revealed that there was a statistically significant difference for all six groups of pairing p 0 05 this showed that the effect of floating plant supplementary aeration and circuit connection on the organic matter degradation in ufcw mfc were statistically significant the non planted planted pairing showed that e crassipes enhanced the total cod removal in cw mfc the improvement of cod removal might be due to the plant rhizosphere provide carbon source through root exudates for microbial growth besides leakage of oxygen from the root of the plant to the adjacent microenvironment also promoted the growth of aerobic microbes and thus improved the organic matter reduction 29 in this study the improvement of total cod removal by the supplementary aeration was not obvious because most of the organic matter was degraded in the anodic region at the bottom of the bioreactor the supplementary aeration was though significantly enhanced the total cod removal from the statistical perspective which could be due to the aerobic biodegradation the effect of the floating plant supplementary aeration and circuit connection was further investigated by comparing the cod removal at sampling point s1 anaerobic region as shown in fig 4 b the cod removal of the planted bioreactor stage ii was 2 better than non planted bioreactor stage i while the aerated bioreactor stage iii was performed 9 better than planted bioreactor stage ii and 6 better than open circuit bioreactor stage iv at s1 similarly the anova showed that there was a significant difference between the operating parameters and the turkey post hoc test was conducted as mentioned previously for cod removal at s1 the results revealed that there was no significant difference between the non planted planted and planted open circuit pairings p 0 05 while there was a significant difference for another four pairings p 0 05 the insignificant difference between non planted planted paring indicated that the effect of floating plant on the cod removal at the anaerobic region was not obvious oon et al 21 reported that the electron transfer enhanced the biodegradation of organic substrate and consequently increase the removal efficiency of cod hence the insignificant difference between non planted planted paring could be due to the lack of oxygen supplied by the floating plant at the cathode to facilitate the transfer of electrons from the anode to cathode this can be further supported by comparing it with the planted aerated pairing the significant difference between planted aerated pairing could be owing to the increase of the electron transfer rate which was corresponding to the increase of do through the supplementary aeration at the cathode as a result the cod removal efficiency at s1 was greatly improved from stage ii to stage iii the significant difference between aerated open circuit indicated that closed circuit statistically significantly enhanced the cod removal compared to open circuit in closed circuit anode could act as the terminal electron acceptor to increase the metabolic rates of anaerobic bacteria 30 this could accelerate the conversion of substrates to produce more electrons and consequently enhanced the cod removal at s1 furthermore closed circuit could promote the growth of electrogenic bacteria which could also stimulate the biodegradation of organic matters fang et al 20 and srivastava et al 31 reported a similar result where closed circuit performed 12 and 12 20 better than open circuit respectively the planted open circuit pairing revealed the relationship between aeration and circuit connection on the cod removal at s1 planted bioreactor stage ii was operated in closed circuit and without aeration while open circuit bioreactor stage iv was operated in open circuit with supplementary aeration the insignificant difference between this pairing indicated that the supplementary aeration and closed circuit connection will only greatly enhanced the cod removal at the anaerobic region when the bioreactor was operated in closed circuit with supplementary aeration this can be supported by comparing with planted aerated and aerated open circuit pairings which both pairings showed aerated bioreactor stage iii statistically significantly improve the biodegradation of organic matters at s1 compared to planted stage ii and open circuit stage iv bioreactors in addition the kinetic study on the cod removal was conducted to compare the performance of cod removal between the four stages the reaction rate constant k and regression coefficient values r2 of the cod removal are presented in table 3 the high regression coefficient values show that the removal of cod was best fitted to the pseudo second order kinetic model this result is agreed with the outcome from sarioglu and bisgin 32 who investigated the kinetic behaviour of the degradation of co substrate glucose and maxilon yellow gl using anaerobic mixed culture they observed the cod degradation for dye free control samples followed the pseudo second order kinetic the results indicated that cod degradation through the microbial activities occurred via pseudo second order kinetic the cod removal rate constant was ranked in decreasing order of stages iii iv ii i stage iii showed the highest cod degradation kinetic rate constant 0 0047 l mg h which was 1 3 times higher than stage iv 0 0035 l mg h 1 9 times higher than stage ii 0 0025 l mg h and 2 8 times higher than stage i 0 0017 l mg h overall the results suggested the operating conditions of stage iii was the best in term of cod removal it is expected that a more significant difference can be observed when a higher strength of organic wastewater was introduced to the system the inoculated gravel and activated carbon that placed inside the ufcw mfc bioreactor allowed the anaerobic and aerobic microbes to attach and grow on the media consequently the accumulation and growth of microbes contributed to the high cod removal efficiency activated carbon served as a good medium for the attachment of microbes because of its large surface area and helpful capillary water absorption 33 besides bioregeneration also enhanced the degradation of organic matter by microorganisms bioregeneration is known as the restoration of the adsorptive capacity of activated carbon by microorganisms for further adsorption bioregeneration occurs as a result of a concentration gradient between the carbon and the bulk liquid 34 oon et al 21 reported that the use of activated carbon as electrodes improved the cod removal at the anaerobic region compared to carbon cloth the study of liu et al 33 also demonstrated that activated carbon promoted bacterial adhesion and colonization better than carbon cloth the results indicated that the medium used for attachment of microbes play an important role in cod reduction as the larger microbial attachment could lead to better performance on organic matter degradation 3 3 2 ammonium and nitrate ions removal nitrogen removal from wastewater was mainly contributed by the nitrification and denitrification process both nitrification and denitrification process are highly dependent on the do as the nitrification process favoured to be occurred at aerobic condition whereas the denitrification process only takes place at anaerobic anoxic condition ammonium and nitrate profiles along the wetland bed were analyzed to evaluate the effect of different operating conditions on nitrogen removal in ufcw mfc as shown in table 2 the ammonium removal efficiency was only 29 and 39 for non planted stage i and planted bioreactor stage ii respectively the low removal efficiency was due to the low do concentration in the non planted stage i and planted bioreactor stage ii as the nitrification process favoured to happen in the aerobic condition the ammonium removal between non planted and planted bioreactor was statistically significant p 0 05 this was because e crassipes could uptake nutrients to support the growth as well as release oxygen to the water through the roots which can enhance the growth of nitrifying bacteria and improve the ammonium reduction 22 on the other hand 96 of ammonium removal was obtained when supplementary aeration was introduced into the aerated stage iii and open circuit stage iv bioreactors this demonstrated that supplementary aeration could promote the nitrification process and enhanced the oxidation of ammonium by the nitrifying bacteria in the cathodic region fig 5 a shows there is a sharp decline of ammonium concentration in s3 which was due to the air diffusion from the aerator located at s4 generally the reduction efficiency of ammonium was corresponding to the do profile fig 2 in the nitrification process there are basically two oxidation steps involved the oxidation of ammonium ion nh4 to nitrite no2 is first carried out by the ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob the intermediate no2 is then oxidized by nitrobacter species to nitrate no3 14 therefore the bioreactor with supplementary aeration showed higher ammonium removal as oxygen is required in the nitrification process there is no significant difference between the closed and open circuits in ammonium removal p 0 05 this could be due to the low concentration of ammonium was introduced into the bioreactor as most of the ammonium was almost completely oxidized in both closed and open circuit operation in this study the results suggested that the significance of operating parameters on the ammonium removal was ranked in decreasing order of supplementary aeration plant circuit connection denitrification occurs when oxygen levels are depleted and nitrate is acted as the electron acceptor for the anaerobic respiration of denitrifiers 35 in the denitrification process denitrifiers such as pseudomonas species break apart nitrate to obtain oxygen and reduce nitrate to nitrogen no3 no2 n2o n2 in anaerobic anoxic condition fig 5 b depicts that high removal efficiency of nitrate 89 and 84 was observed in the non planted stage i and planted stage ii bioreactors respectively this is because the whole wetland bed of non planted and planted bioreactors was almost in anaerobic conditions as there is no supplementary aeration supplied to the bioreactor the nitrate removal between non planted and planted bioreactors was not significant p 0 05 the higher nitrate residual in the planted bioreactor stage ii compared with non planted stage i may be due to the stimulation of nitrifying bacteria to proceed the nitrification process as a result of oxygen leakage from the roots 6 similarly the nitrate removal in aerated stage iii and open circuit stage iv bioreactors was low since supplementary aeration inhibits the denitrification process besides the increase of nitrate concentration at the effluent was corresponding to the reduction of ammonium as the nitrification produced nitrate ion at the end of the process turkey post hoc test revealed that supplementary aeration significantly affected the denitrification process p 0 05 while there was no significant difference between aerated and open circuit bioreactors p 0 05 the nitrate removal in the open circuit was though tested significantly higher at the anaerobic region sampling point s2 compared with the closed circuit p 0 05 this could be due to the competition of electrons for electricity generation and denitrification in the closed circuit on the other hand nitrate could be acted as the electron acceptor in the open circuit and subsequently improve the nitrate removal in the anaerobic region of ufcw mfc 3 4 bioelectricity generation in ufcw mfc system 3 4 1 voltage output and power density the bioelectricity generation performance of ufcw mfc was evaluated through the monitoring of voltage output and power densities three anodes were embedded in the bioreactor to investigate the influence of electrode spacing on the energy produced from the hybrid system the distance between the cathode and the three anodes was 15 cm c a1 30 cm c a2 and 45 cm c a3 respectively the voltage output of three anodes in different operating conditions are shown in fig 6 a and table 4 generally the smallest electrode spacing c a1 demonstrated the highest voltage output for stage i and ii which recorded an average of 47 5 2 9 mv and 79 9 9 2 mv respectively the result indicated that voltage increase with the decrease of electrode spacing 36 37 when supplementary aeration was introduced to the bioreactor in stage iii the voltage at c a1 was initially increased sharply but showed decrement after 10 days of operation this may be due to the diffusion of oxygen from the supplementary aeration into the anode a1 and decrease the potential difference between anode and cathode which is crucial in producing electricity in mfc 38 as a result c a2 with larger electrode spacing performed better than c a1 and recorded an average voltage output of 291 44 2 mv oon et al 21 found a similar result where the voltage output of the smallest electrode spacing was the lowest in the study due to the air diffusion into the anodic region as shown in table 4 the voltage output of planted bioreactor stage ii was 1 7 3 3 and 3 6 folds higher than the non planted bioreactor stage i for three different electrode spacing c a1 c a2 and c a3 respectively the increase of voltage output from stage i to stage ii indicated that e crassipes contributes to electricity generation this could be due to the increase of do concentration at cathode through the leakage of oxygen from the roots of the plant 14 since there was more electron acceptor o2 in the planted bioreactor stage ii hence more o2 was ready to accept the electrons from the anode to produce electricity and contribute to a higher voltage output the power densities of c a1 was the highest followed by c a2 and c a3 in stage i and ii as shown in table 4 a similar trend of power densities was obtained in the internal resistance the internal resistance of both stages i and ii were 200 620 and 620 ω for c a1 c a2 and c a3 respectively this suggested that smaller electrode spacing reduced the internal resistance and improved the power density produced by the ufcw mfc system 39 fig 6 b depicts the power density observed at different operating conditions in the bioreactor the power density obtained in the aerated bioreactor stage iii was the highest compared to the planted stage ii and non planted stage i bioreactors which was 45 46 3 83 6 00 0 11 and 1 55 0 18 mw m3 respectively the internal resistance was reduced from 620 to 500 ω which could contribute to higher electricity production oxygen served as the electron acceptor in mfc to complete the circuit to produce electricity supplementary aeration and oxygen leakage from the floating plant to the cathode have increased the potential difference between the cathode and anodes the presence of a strong electron acceptor and the increment of electron acceptor concentration could enhance the electron transfer rate and contribute to energy production 40 41 as a result the power density generated in the aerated bioreactor stage iii was the highest followed by planted stage ii and lastly non planted stage i bioreactors due to the difference in the concentration of do as the electron acceptor 3 4 2 coulombic efficiency and normalized energy recovery in order to evaluate the energy recovery from wastewater coulombic efficiency ce defined as the ratio of electrons that is contributed to the electricity generation from the degradation of organic substrate was calculated and shown in fig 6 c and table 4 the ce was the highest when the electrode spacing was the smallest c a1 in all three stages this could be due to low cod residual at that region and more organic substrate was converted to the electric current the results suggested that ce can be enhanced by smaller electrode spacing 42 aerated bioreactor stage iii showed the highest ce followed by planted stage ii and non planted stage i bioreactors the ce increased from 0 24 at stage i to 0 58 at stage ii and finally increased to 2 15 at stage iii the vast difference between these three stages was mainly due to the presence of oxygen as the electron acceptor more oxygen was available at the cathodic region of the planted stage ii and aerated stage iii bioreactors and this increased the electron transfer rate from anode to cathode as a result more electrons were used for electricity generation and contribute to a higher ce the results indicated that both plant and supplementary aeration play an important role in bioenergy recovery the ce obtained in this study was relatively high compared with other cw mfc studies as shown in table 5 but was considerably low when compared to mfcs low ce was obtained in the hybrid system because only a small fraction of organic matter degraded was converted to the generation of electricity the consumption of substrates for processes such as fermentation and methanogenesis rather than cell synthesis by electrogenic bacteria could also result in low ce 10 besides nitrate also acts as an electron acceptor in the denitrification process denitrifiers such as pseudomonas that exist in the system could compete with electrogenic bacteria for the electrons produced from the degradation of organic matter oon et al 4 reported that the ability of nitrate as the electron acceptor is stronger compared to the anode in the anodic region this indicated that more electrons were used for denitrification compared to electricity generation the low ratio of electrode area to bioreactor volume could also result in the low ce in the hybrid system 33 debabov 43 also indicated that only certain microbes in the population contributed to the production of electricity therefore low ce obtained in this study might due to the mass diversity microorganisms exist in the ufcw mfc as mixed cultures sludge was used for inoculation in this study normalized energy recovery ner was calculated to analyze energy recovery from the removal of substrates ners and the volume of treated wastewater nerv 44 ners obtained in this study was relatively high compared to other cw mfc studies table 5 this could be due to the difference in design plant aeration substrate concentration and electrode material ners showed a similar trend as ce in terms of electrode spacing where both ce and ners decrease as the electrode spacing increase on the other hand nerv demonstrated a slight difference trend from ce and ners the highest nerv was found at c a2 0 31 wh m3 followed by c a3 0 24 wh m3 and c a1 0 16 wh m3 since nerv does not account for the cod removal in the system thus air diffusion into c a1 has greatly decreased the electricity generation and lowered the nerv these results indicated that electricity generation and energy recovery can be enhanced by introduced the plant and supplementary aeration as well as reduced the electrode spacing 4 conclusion this study shows the importance of the floating plant aeration and closed circuit connection on the wastewater treatment performance and electricity generation do level in the cathodic region could be enhanced by the floating plant and supplementary aeration which leads to better removal of ammonium as well as increase the electron acceptor concentration for higher bioelectricity generation closed circuit connection enhanced the degradation of organic matter as it promotes the growth of electrogenic bacteria and the transfer of electrons also aided in the biodegradation of organic pollutants the performance of ufcw mfc was most significantly affected by supplementary aeration compared to floating plant and circuit connection overall the operating conditions of stage iii demonstrated the optimum performance of ufcw mfc in terms of wastewater treatment and bioelectricity generation declaration of competing interest none

experimental procedure the study divided into six phases used an inoculum adapted to the amd treatment and another of methanogenic origin the reactor treated the wastewater at 15 30 and 55 c according

results of the asbr operation composed of the average concentrations of so4 2 cod and fe2 affluent and effluent as well as the average ph values sulfide concentration and several removals under different starting conditions the affluent values in all phases indicated the concentrations of so4 2 and cod remained close to 1500 mg l 1 keeping the cod so4 2 ratio close to 1 the bioreactor produced alkalinity indicated by the increase of the ph values 3 2 alkalinity and ph evaluation fig 1 shows the affluent and effluent ph values as well as the values of alkalinity to bicarbonate produced in the system during the phases the values indicate an increase in the effluent ph in the first two phases with consequent alkalinity production the ph increase occurred by mass transfer on the granular surface with the synthetic amd reagents by the consumption of acidity and generation of alkalinity to bicarbonate predicted by the dissimilatory reduction of sulfate with complete oxidation of the organic matter by the srb although phases a30 and n30 reach effluent ph values close to neutrality phase a30 reached the effluent ph value equal to 7 more quickly than phase n30 the effluent ph value is an indicator of the microbial activity and adaptation of an anaerobic system and its values close to neutrality is required to balance the anaerobic process 19 however a low microbial metabolism in the reactor justified the low rates and consumption of acidity and alkalinity production since the optimal operating temperature for most pure srb cultures is in the range between 28 and 32 c 20 a psychrophilic bioreactor treating amd with a ph of 4 2 showed an effluent ph between 5 0 and 7 3 21 similar to the values of phases a15 and n15 the temperature change in an anaerobic reactor containing different metabolic groups and without accumulation of intermediates causes the unbalance of the anaerobic digestion process due to the different responses of the microorganisms to the disturbance 22 thus the increase in volatile fatty acids in the effluent occurs due to an immediate drop in ph after a cold temperature shock in the reactor 23 although this study used constant temperatures in the starting conditions the inoculants came from mesophilic treatments without adaptation at 15 and 55 c the period of adaptation to the imposed condition indicated a drop in ph due to the unbalanced reactions 3 3 cod and sulfate removal evaluation for the operating phases at 30 c the sulfate removal rate increased in the phase n30 indicated the adaptation of the microorganisms from the sludge to the treated amd as illustrated in fig 2 a at the end of phase n30 the bioreactor reached a removal rate close to 75 this same rate of 75 was achieved at the beginning of phase a30 with a value of 93 removal at the end thus the high removal efficiency in a short period was due to the sludge adapted to the effluent regarding other phases the temperature influenced the sulfate reduction according to the high effluent sulfate values compared to the values of the mesophilic phases the final sulfate removal from phase a30 to phase a15 decreased from 93 to 45 as well as decreased from phase a30 to phase a55 considering the non adapted sludge the drop in final sulfate removal occurred between the phases n30 and n15 from 76 to 35 and between the phases n30 and n55 from 76 to 50 however analyzing the psychrophilic and thermophilic phases the microorganisms adapted quickly in the phases with high temperatures evidenced by the excellent results of effluent sulfate while in the phases operated at 15 c the results gradually improved in the adaptation phase lasting 64 days castro neto et al 10 observed sulfate removal efficiency of 43 for an initial concentration of 1000 mg l 1 using an asbr with non adapted sludge under 30 c and cycles of 24 h in the present study this efficiency occurred in the 22nd operating cycle of phase n30 after 44 days of operation the different responses are due to the cycle time and initial concentration demonstrating that adaptation occurs quickly when using 48 h of operation per cycle and initial so4 2 concentration of 1500 mg l 1 at 15 c the amd treatment in a bioreactor indicated 44 of sulfate removal with an initial so4 2 concentration of 900 mg l 1 21 the result was similar to those obtained at the end of the psychrophilic phases of this study regardless of the inoculum domingues et al 24 achieved a sulfate removal efficiency of 52 2 for an initial so4 2 concentration of 1125 mg l 1 from the treated basal medium in an anaerobic batch reactor maintained at 55 c with 55 h cycles while in this study for the same temperature the average sulfate removal efficiency was 34 and 45 for the adapted and non adapted inoculum respectively in starting condition although the removal percentage was lower when compared to the sulfate removed load this study showed a similar valueof 10 6 mg so4 2 h 1 in the phase a55 in the phase n55 the removed load was higher with a value of 14 1 mg so4 2 h 1 due to its mesophilic methanogenic origin the sludge used in the phase n30 consumed more organic matter in the cod form at the beginning of the operation concerning the other phases according to fig 2 b in the phase a30 although it has shown efficient results of sulfate consumption a lower cod removal rate compared to the phase n30 suggested the predominance of sulfidogenesis in the system 25 which certifies that the inoculum was already in appropriate conditions for the activity proposed in the phase a30 the reduced consumption of sulfate and cod by the other phases indicated the non adaptation of microorganisms in the system to the environment at 15 and 55 c even after 30 cycles since the final sulfate removals were 45 35 45 and 38 for the phases a15 n15 a55 and n55 respectively and for the final cod removals the values were 39 24 37 and 24 these removals suggest a longer adaptation period to achieve promising results compared to the mesophilic phase considering for each mol of reduced sulfate or 1 g 0 67 mol of ethanol or 0 67 g of cod is consumed based on this relation it determined the contribution of sulfidogenesis in the total removal of cod from the system the value of the phase n55 indicated another carbon source in addition to ethanol contributed to the generation of sulfide the additional contribution occurred due to the cod portion absorbed and or adsorbed in the sludge which became available for use during the cycles the microbial capacity to store substrates after ceasing the sulfate and cod feeding of biological reactors demonstrated after 15 days of operation the continuity of sulfidogenesis due to the accumulation of cod and sulfate from the system 26 the sulfidogenic phases had the greatest cod contributions to sulfidogenesis in operation at 30 c 98 5 of all electrons donated by the ethanol molecules generated sulfide characterizing sulfidogenesis as the predominant electron route although phases n30 and n15 identified the largest electrons flow for other processes besides to sulfidogenesis the selective capacity of the sludge not adapted at 15 c stood out since the electron direction for the formation of sulfide predominated in concerning the operation at 30 c 3 4 fe2 removal and sulfide production evaluation the final effluent sulfide concentration in the phases a30 and n30 shown in fig 3 a concerning the initial values increased due to the high sulfate removal from the system adaptation of the sludge to the treated effluent or environmental condition and thermodynamic favoring of the reactions in the phase a30 the initial production of sulfide was equivalent to the values at the end of 30 cycles in the phase n30 suggesting the adaptation of sludge to the amd of phase n30 the phase a30 demonstrated a greater sulfide production than the others reaching a maximum value of 230 mg l 1 at the end of the 29th cycle in the phase a15 the inoculum adapted over the cycles since the initial sulfide production was close to zero and at the end it reached a maximum value of 67 mg l 1 in the phase n15 concentrations dropped from the 14th cycle remaining constant in the range of 57 mg l 1 from the 18th cycle in operations at 55 c the phase a55 showed a low variation between the data presenting an average of 62 20 mg l 1 of dissolved sulfide in the phase n55 despite the initial increase followed by a fall an average of 120 mg l 1 was maintained wastewater ph had a great influence on the sulfide species produced during the sulfate reduction the phases a30 and n30 showed lower concentrations of h2s as an effect of the ph value close to 7 and phases a15 n15 a55 and n55 presented mean effluent ph below 6 indicating greater generation of h2s since the h2s molecule can permeate the cell membrane and denature proteins of microorganisms the predominance of h2s in the psychrophilic and thermophilic phases justifies the low performance since h2s can be toxic to microorganisms 27 the fe2 removal efficiency followed the sulfide production rate as illustrated in fig 3 b as the sulfide production increased resulting in the formation of iron sulfide as in the phase a15 which when the sulfide concentration increased in the 15th cycle the concentration of fe2 decreased reaching a final removal efficiency of 69 the removal efficiencies of phases a30 and n30 indicate that the asbr would be able to remove a greater amount of fe2 according to values greater than 95 the phases n15 a55 and n55 started with high rates of metal removal however these values were not maintained throughout the cycles suggesting a gradual selection of microorganisms to the environment during the adaptation period of a mesophilic sulfidogenic reactor the average sulfide production was 40 mg l 1 however when adding the fe2 concentration of 100 mg l 1 the average sulfide production increased to 72 5 mg l 1 9 both concentrations were lower compared to the mesophilic phases in the present study in the first cycle of phase a30 the sulfide concentration of sulfide was 127 mg l 1 and in the 23rd cycle of phase n30 the concentration was 98 mg l 1 a sulfidogenic bioreactor treating amd at 9 c obtained 99 of fe2 removal 28 even at lower temperatures 15 c this study reached fe2 removal values of 69 and 21 for phases a15 and n15 which suggests that the non adaptation of sludge to the treatment temperature led to a lack of microbial communities specific for iron reduction 3 5 kinetic analysis the analysis of the variables ph sulfate cod sulfide and fe2 throughout the cycle occurred through temporal profiles fig 4 shows the profiles for the evaluation of ph sulfide and fe2 the ph behavior along the cycles was similar in the thermophilic and psychrophilic conditions for both inoculants in these phases the final values were close to 5 with stability in the first hours of the cycle the neutrality values close to 7 of the solution was found in the mesophilic conditions with a considerable increase in the value 5 7 6 7 between 9 and 21 h of operation for the adapted inoculum phase a30 and between 21 and 33 h of operation for the inoculum non adapted to the affluent phase n30 regarding the production of dissolved sulfide the mesophilic condition of the adapted sludgeprovided the highest concentration of effluent sulfide 211 mg l 1 in this phase the low variation of the concentration values occurred from the 20th h of operation considering the non adapted inoculum the highest concentration occurred in the thermophilic phase with a value of 142 mg l 1 the stability of values in the phase n30 close to 120 mg l 1 was reached around the 10th h of operation regarding the sulfide generation by the psychrophilic phases the results suggested a similar behavior for both inoculants however for the non adapted phase the concentration values throughout the cycle are slightly higher than the adapted phase for the analysis of fe2 removal the behavior and effluent values were similar in both mesophilic phases in these phases from the 9th hour of operation the removal efficiency reached values of 90 for the adapted inoculum the removal drop behavior in the phases a55 and a15 were similar however the final removal efficiencies were 86 and 68 the removal of the non adapted inoculum demonstrated a similar behavior between the thermophiles and mesophiles due to the concentration decay in the first hours of operation and the final removal above 95 while the psychrophilic phase obtained a maximum removal of 21 the kinetic adjustment fig 5 allowed to obtain parameters such as kap and the residual sulfate and cod concentrations the model considered first order consumption kinetics with the adjusted values are shown in table 3 in the sulfate results the phases with an inoculum of sulfidogenic origin presented the lowest residual concentrations concerning operations with methanogenic inoculum when compared at the same operating temperature the sulfidogenic phases showed lower kap concerning the methanogenic phases for the same operating temperature demonstrating that the choice of the inoculum interferes in the substrate consumption rate and the residual concentration the kinetic constants of the adapted inoculum changed according to temperature both phases a15 and a55 presented lower kinetic constants 0 05 and 0 03 h 1 than the value of the phase a30 0 06 h 1 for the non adapted inoculum the phase n15 indicated the highest constant 0 54 h 1 however it is also the highest residual concentration nevertheless this phase presented the lowest adjusted coefficient of determination r a d j 2 compared to the adjustments for the non adapted sludge regarding the cod removal kinetics except for phase n15 which did not present an adequate adjustment r a d j 2 0 61 the phases containing methanogenic sludge obtained the lowest sr when compared to the sulfidogenic phases however the differences are insignificant considering the standard deviation suggesting that the consumption of cod at psychrophilic or thermophilic temperature does not differ by the inoculum origin in general the kinetic constants of cod consumption in the phases with non adapted inoculum increased with the temperature change between the mesophilic kap 0 12 h 1 psychrophilic kap 0 07 h 1 and thermophilic kap 0 06 h 1 operations for the results of the adapted inoculum condition the constants increased comparing the mesophilic phase kap 0 05 h 1 with the other phases kap 3 36 h 1 and kap 0 09 h 1 3 6 mpn analysis fig 6 shows the bottles at the end of each analysis for the initial and final conditions of all phases for the phases a30 a15 and n15 there was an increase in the srb population due to the increase in the srb concentration per ml of sludge in the phase a30 and n15 the order of microorganisms increased by 10 times and in a15 the growth was the same or greater 105 times according to table 4 thus the growth of communities in the inoculants was favored due to theirsulfate andcod concentration or temperature the phases n30 a55 and n55 had a decrease in the order of 10 times in the phase n30 104 times in the phase a55 and 103 in the phase n55 on microorganisms quantity of the analyzed population however this reduction did not affect the sulfate removal from the reactor since in the phase n30 over the cycles efficiency increased and in the phases a55 and n55 there were no changes this reduction of viable cells in the phases n30 and a55 resulted from the dragging of the new cells during the medium changes during the phase or by the selection of viable species to the submitted environment the beginning of the phase n55 presented an order compatible with the initial result of the phase n15 the initial analyzes of the phases a30 a15 and a55 had the results of compatible order indicating that the reserved biomass did not change the srb population during the reservation period 3 7 practical implications the results of this work indicated that the asbr startup with ethanol as an electron donor was effective in fe2 removal in the phases operated at 30 and 55 c although the thermophilic phase with non adapted sludge showed the lowest average cod consumption rate the parameters results indicate that the sludge of methanogenic origin presented high adaptability to the environment with considerable efficiencies at 55 c the statistical investigation of the srb population under different conditions is a relevant approach which allows understanding basic and significant concepts in environmental processes 29 indirectly to the objective of the work knowing the duration of the adaptation period may allow the reduction of operating costs facilitating the occurrence of engineering projects for the wastewater treatment 30 4 conclusions the operating temperature and inoculum origin have been successfully evaluated in asbr startup treating amd the most efficient removal of sulfate occurred in the mesophilic phase with sludge previously adapted to the treated effluent the fe2 removal was affected by the temperature in both types of inoculums since at 30 c the average removal rates greater than 99 was achieved while in the psychrophilic and thermophilic phases the average removal did not exceed 60 and 92 the mesophilic phase proved to be more suitable for sulfate phase a30 and cod removal phase n30 the first order kinetic adjustment considering the residual concentration provided the highest kinetic constant for the sulfate removal rate in the phase n30 with a value of 0 09 h 1 and the lowest value in the phase a55 0 03 h 1 demonstrating that the inoculum origin and temperature interfere with the substrate consumption rate mpn analysis indicated a growth of new cells in the srb group in the phases a30 a15 and n15 as well as the selection of species in the group and a decline in the population quantity in the phases n30 a55 and n55 according to the stabilized data at the end of each phase it can be inferred that both inoculums at different temperatures adapted to the conditions of the bioreactor as indicated by the ph increase and the sulfide production demonstrating that despite the operation at 30 c since adapted inoculum was the one with the greatest removal other conditions can be enhanced

the following salts concentration mg l 1 na2so4 1832 feso4 7h2o 496 mgso4 7h2o 213 nh4cl 58 zncl2 42 nh2po4 h2o 34 and cuso4 5h2o 20 for this composition the so4 2 concentration was 1500 mg l 1 100 mg l 1 of fe2 20 mg l 1 of zn2 and 5 mg l 1 of cu2 cod concentration obtained from the addition of 0 91 ml of ethanol for each liter of amd was 1500 mg l 1 which kept the cod so4 2 ratio close to 1 2 2 experimental procedure the study divided into six phases used an inoculum adapted to the amd treatment and another of methanogenic origin the reactor treated the wastewater at 15 30 and 55 c according to table 1 which contains the operational phases of the asbr the cleaning in the reactor occurred at each phase change followed by a new inoculation of biomass 2 3 physicochemical analysis the monitoring of the system through analyzes of sulfate sulfide ph cod fe2 and alkalinity at the beginning and end of each cycle occurred according to standard methods described by apha et al 14 cod

for the determination of iron the 3500 fe b method was applied and the ph the electrometric method 4500 h b the quantification of dissolved sulfide s2 occurred by the colorimetric method in a spectrophotometer and the alkalinity to bicarbonate by titrimetric method 15 as well as volatile acid analyzes followed a previous study 16 2 4 growth enumeration for srb by mpn the growth enumeration for the srb group present in the sludge at the beginning and end of each phase was determined by the bacterial density estimation method 9221 c 14 known as the mpn postgate c medium was composted by

microorganisms groups and through the counting of the positive and negative flasks of the last three dilutions containing positive results the mnp value can be related to the literature 14 which

profile at the end of each phase physicochemical analyzes were carried out over a 48 h cycle characterizing a temporal profile of consumption production of the compounds the criterion for ending the phases was when the last five results were stabilized low changes between them and or when the phase reached 35 cycles the apparent kinetic parameters of sulfate reduction and cod consumption were

results of the asbr operation composed of the average concentrations of so4 2 cod and fe2 affluent and effluent as well as the average ph values sulfide concentration and several removals under different starting conditions the affluent values in all phases indicated the concentrations of so4 2 and cod remained close to 1500 mg l 1 keeping the cod so4 2 ratio close to 1 the bioreactor produced alkalinity indicated by the increase of the ph values 3 2 alkalinity and ph evaluation fig 1 shows the affluent and effluent ph values as well as the values of alkalinity to bicarbonate produced in the system during the phases the values indicate an increase in the effluent ph in the first two phases with consequent alkalinity production the ph increase occurred by mass transfer on the granular surface with the synthetic amd reagents by the consumption of acidity and generation of alkalinity to bicarbonate predicted by the dissimilatory reduction of sulfate with complete oxidation of the organic matter by the srb although phases a30 and n30 reach effluent ph values close to neutrality phase a30 reached the effluent ph value equal to 7 more quickly than phase n30 the effluent ph value is an indicator of the microbial activity and adaptation of an anaerobic system and its values close to neutrality is required to balance the anaerobic process 19 however a low microbial metabolism in the reactor justified the low rates and consumption of acidity and alkalinity production since the optimal operating temperature for most pure srb cultures is in the range between 28 and 32 c 20 a psychrophilic bioreactor treating amd with a ph of 4 2 showed an effluent ph between 5 0 and 7 3 21 similar to the values of phases a15 and n15 the temperature change in an anaerobic reactor containing different metabolic groups and without accumulation of intermediates causes the unbalance of the anaerobic digestion process due to the different responses of the microorganisms to the disturbance 22 thus the increase in volatile fatty acids in the effluent occurs due to an immediate drop in ph after a cold temperature shock in the reactor 23 although this study used constant temperatures in the starting conditions the inoculants came from mesophilic treatments without adaptation at 15 and 55 c the period of adaptation to the imposed condition indicated a drop in ph due to the unbalanced reactions 3 3 cod and sulfate removal evaluation for the operating phases at 30 c the sulfate removal rate increased in the phase n30 indicated the adaptation of the microorganisms from the sludge to the treated amd as illustrated in fig 2 a at the end of phase n30 the bioreactor reached a removal rate close to 75 this same rate of 75 was achieved at the beginning of phase a30 with a value of 93 removal at the end thus the high removal efficiency in a short period was due to the sludge adapted to the effluent regarding other phases the temperature influenced the sulfate reduction according to the high effluent sulfate values compared to the values of the mesophilic phases the final sulfate removal from phase a30 to phase a15 decreased from 93 to 45 as well as decreased from phase a30 to phase a55 considering the non adapted sludge the drop in final sulfate removal occurred between the phases n30 and n15 from 76 to 35 and between the phases n30 and n55 from 76 to 50 however analyzing the psychrophilic and thermophilic phases the microorganisms adapted quickly in the phases with high temperatures evidenced by the excellent results of effluent sulfate while in the phases operated at 15 c the results gradually improved in the adaptation phase lasting 64 days castro neto et al 10 observed sulfate removal efficiency of 43 for an initial concentration of 1000 mg l 1 using an asbr with non adapted sludge under 30 c and cycles of 24 h in the present study this efficiency occurred in the 22nd operating cycle of phase n30 after 44 days of operation the different responses are due to the cycle time and initial concentration demonstrating that adaptation occurs quickly when using 48 h of operation per cycle and initial so4 2 concentration of 1500 mg l 1 at 15 c the amd treatment in a bioreactor indicated 44 of sulfate removal with an initial so4 2 concentration of 900 mg l 1 21 the result was similar to those obtained at the end of the psychrophilic phases of this study regardless of the inoculum domingues et al 24 achieved a sulfate removal efficiency of 52 2 for an initial so4 2 concentration of 1125 mg l 1 from the treated basal medium in an anaerobic batch reactor maintained at 55 c with 55 h cycles while in this study for the same temperature the average sulfate removal efficiency was 34 and 45 for the adapted and non adapted inoculum respectively in starting condition although the removal percentage was lower when compared to the sulfate removed load this study showed a similar valueof 10 6 mg so4 2 h 1 in the phase a55 in the phase n55 the removed load was higher with a value of 14 1 mg so4 2 h 1 due to its mesophilic methanogenic origin the sludge used in the phase n30 consumed more organic matter in the cod form at the beginning of the operation concerning the other phases according to fig 2 b in the phase a30 although it has shown efficient results of sulfate consumption a lower cod removal rate compared to the phase n30 suggested the predominance of sulfidogenesis in the system 25 which certifies that the inoculum was already in appropriate conditions for the activity proposed in the phase a30 the reduced consumption of sulfate and cod by the other phases indicated the non adaptation of microorganisms in the system to the environment at 15 and 55 c even after 30 cycles since the final sulfate removals were 45 35 45 and 38 for the phases a15 n15 a55 and n55 respectively and for the final cod removals the values were 39 24 37 and 24 these removals suggest a longer adaptation period to achieve promising results compared to the mesophilic phase considering for each mol of reduced sulfate or 1 g 0 67 mol of ethanol or 0 67 g of cod is consumed based on this relation it determined the contribution of sulfidogenesis in the total removal of cod from the system the value of the phase n55 indicated another carbon source in addition to ethanol contributed to the generation of sulfide the additional contribution occurred due to the cod portion absorbed and or adsorbed in the sludge which became available for use during the cycles the microbial capacity to store substrates after ceasing the sulfate and cod feeding of biological reactors demonstrated after 15 days of operation the continuity of sulfidogenesis due to the accumulation of cod and sulfate from the system 26 the sulfidogenic phases had the greatest cod contributions to sulfidogenesis in operation at 30 c 98 5 of all electrons donated by the ethanol molecules generated sulfide characterizing sulfidogenesis as the predominant electron route although phases n30 and n15 identified the largest electrons flow for other processes besides to sulfidogenesis the selective capacity of the sludge not adapted at 15 c stood out since the electron direction for the formation of sulfide predominated in concerning the operation at 30 c 3 4 fe2 removal and sulfide production evaluation the final effluent sulfide concentration in the phases a30 and n30 shown in fig 3 a concerning the initial values increased due to the high sulfate removal from the system adaptation of the sludge to the treated effluent or environmental condition and thermodynamic favoring of the reactions in the phase a30 the initial production of sulfide was equivalent to the values at the end of 30 cycles in the phase n30 suggesting the adaptation of sludge to the amd of phase n30 the phase a30 demonstrated a greater sulfide production than the others reaching a maximum value of 230 mg l 1 at the end of the 29th cycle in the phase a15 the inoculum adapted over the cycles since the initial sulfide production was close to zero and at the end it reached a maximum value of 67 mg l 1 in the phase n15 concentrations dropped from the 14th cycle remaining constant in the range of 57 mg l 1 from the 18th cycle in operations at 55 c the phase a55 showed a low variation between the data presenting an average of 62 20 mg l 1 of dissolved sulfide in the phase n55 despite the initial increase followed by a fall an average of 120 mg l 1 was maintained wastewater ph had a great influence on the sulfide species produced during the sulfate reduction the phases a30 and n30 showed lower concentrations of h2s as an effect of the ph value close to 7 and phases a15 n15 a55 and n55 presented mean effluent ph below 6 indicating greater generation of h2s since the h2s molecule can permeate the cell membrane and denature proteins of microorganisms the predominance of h2s in the psychrophilic and thermophilic phases justifies the low performance since h2s can be toxic to microorganisms 27 the fe2 removal efficiency followed the sulfide production rate as illustrated in fig 3 b as the sulfide production increased resulting in the formation of iron sulfide as in the phase a15 which when the sulfide concentration increased in the 15th cycle the concentration of fe2 decreased reaching a final removal efficiency of 69 the removal efficiencies of phases a30 and n30 indicate that the asbr would be able to remove a greater amount of fe2 according to values greater than 95 the phases n15 a55 and n55 started with high rates of metal removal however these values were not maintained throughout the cycles suggesting a gradual selection of microorganisms to the environment during the adaptation period of a mesophilic sulfidogenic reactor the average sulfide production was 40 mg l 1 however when adding the fe2 concentration of 100 mg l 1 the average sulfide production increased to 72 5 mg l 1 9 both concentrations were lower compared to the mesophilic phases in the present study in the first cycle of phase a30 the sulfide concentration of sulfide was 127 mg l 1 and in the 23rd cycle of phase n30 the concentration was 98 mg l 1 a sulfidogenic bioreactor treating amd at 9 c obtained 99 of fe2 removal 28 even at lower temperatures 15 c this study reached fe2 removal values of 69 and 21 for phases a15 and n15 which suggests that the non adaptation of sludge to the treatment temperature led to a lack of microbial communities specific for iron reduction 3 5 kinetic analysis the analysis of the variables ph sulfate cod sulfide and fe2 throughout the cycle occurred through temporal profiles fig 4 shows the profiles for the evaluation of ph sulfide and fe2 the ph behavior along the cycles was similar in the thermophilic and psychrophilic conditions for both inoculants in these phases the final values were close to 5 with stability in the first hours of the cycle the neutrality values close to 7 of the solution was found in the mesophilic conditions with a considerable increase in the value 5 7 6 7 between 9 and 21 h of operation for the adapted inoculum phase a30 and between 21 and 33 h of operation for the inoculum non adapted to the affluent phase n30 regarding the production of dissolved sulfide the mesophilic condition of the adapted sludgeprovided the highest concentration of effluent sulfide 211 mg l 1 in this phase the low variation of the concentration values occurred from the 20th h of operation considering the non adapted inoculum the highest concentration occurred in the thermophilic phase with a value of 142 mg l 1 the stability of values in the phase n30 close to 120 mg l 1 was reached around the 10th h of operation regarding the sulfide generation by the psychrophilic phases the results suggested a similar behavior for both inoculants however for the non adapted phase the concentration values throughout the cycle are slightly higher than the adapted phase for the analysis of fe2 removal the behavior and effluent values were similar in both mesophilic phases in these phases from the 9th hour of operation the removal efficiency reached values of 90 for the adapted inoculum the removal drop behavior in the phases a55 and a15 were similar however the final removal efficiencies were 86 and 68 the removal of the non adapted inoculum demonstrated a similar behavior between the thermophiles and mesophiles due to the concentration decay in the first hours of operation and the final removal above 95 while the psychrophilic phase obtained a maximum removal of 21 the kinetic adjustment fig 5 allowed to obtain parameters such as kap and the residual sulfate and cod concentrations the model considered first order consumption kinetics with the adjusted values are shown in table 3 in the sulfate results the phases with an inoculum of sulfidogenic origin presented the lowest residual concentrations concerning operations with methanogenic inoculum when compared at the same operating temperature the sulfidogenic phases showed lower kap concerning the methanogenic phases for the same operating temperature demonstrating that the choice of the inoculum interferes in the substrate consumption rate and the residual concentration the kinetic constants of the adapted inoculum changed according to temperature both phases a15 and a55 presented lower kinetic constants 0 05 and 0 03 h 1 than the value of the phase a30 0 06 h 1 for the non adapted inoculum the phase n15 indicated the highest constant 0 54 h 1 however it is also the highest residual concentration nevertheless this phase presented the lowest adjusted coefficient of determination r a d j 2 compared to the adjustments for the non adapted sludge regarding the cod removal kinetics except for phase n15 which did not present an adequate adjustment r a d j 2 0 61 the phases containing methanogenic sludge obtained the lowest sr when compared to the sulfidogenic phases however the differences are insignificant considering the standard deviation suggesting that the consumption of cod at psychrophilic or thermophilic temperature does not differ by the inoculum origin in general the kinetic constants of cod consumption in the phases with non adapted inoculum increased with the temperature change between the mesophilic kap 0 12 h 1 psychrophilic kap 0 07 h 1 and thermophilic kap 0 06 h 1 operations for the results of the adapted inoculum condition the constants increased comparing the mesophilic phase kap 0 05 h 1 with the other phases kap 3 36 h 1 and kap 0 09 h 1 3 6 mpn analysis fig 6 shows the bottles at the end of each analysis for the initial and final conditions of all phases for the phases a30 a15 and n15 there was an increase in the srb population due to the increase in the srb concentration per ml of sludge in the phase a30 and n15 the order of microorganisms increased by 10 times and in a15 the growth was the same or greater 105 times according to table 4 thus the growth of communities in the inoculants was favored due to theirsulfate andcod concentration or temperature the phases n30 a55 and n55 had a decrease in the order of 10 times in the phase n30 104 times in the phase a55 and 103 in the phase n55 on microorganisms quantity of the analyzed population however this reduction did not affect the sulfate removal from the reactor since in the phase n30 over the cycles efficiency increased and in the phases a55 and n55 there were no changes this reduction of viable cells in the phases n30 and a55 resulted from the dragging of the new cells during the medium changes during the phase or by the selection of viable species to the submitted environment the beginning of the phase n55 presented an order compatible with the initial result of the phase n15 the initial analyzes of the phases a30 a15 and a55 had the results of compatible order indicating that the reserved biomass did not change the srb population during the reservation period 3 7 practical implications the results of this work indicated that the asbr startup with ethanol as an electron donor was effective in fe2 removal in the phases operated at 30 and 55 c although the thermophilic phase with non adapted sludge showed the lowest average cod consumption rate the parameters results indicate that the sludge of methanogenic origin presented high adaptability to the environment with considerable efficiencies at 55 c the statistical investigation of the srb population under different conditions is a relevant approach which allows understanding basic and significant concepts in environmental processes 29 indirectly to the objective of the work knowing the duration of the adaptation period may allow the reduction of operating costs facilitating the occurrence of engineering projects for the wastewater treatment 30 4 conclusions the operating temperature and inoculum origin have been successfully evaluated in asbr startup treating amd the most efficient removal of sulfate occurred in the mesophilic phase with sludge previously adapted to the treated effluent the fe2 removal was affected by the temperature in both types of inoculums since at 30 c the average removal rates greater than 99 was achieved while in the psychrophilic and thermophilic phases the average removal did not exceed 60 and 92 the mesophilic phase proved to be more suitable for sulfate phase a30 and cod removal phase n30 the first order kinetic adjustment considering the residual concentration provided the highest kinetic constant for the sulfate removal rate in the phase n30 with a value of 0 09 h 1 and the lowest value in the phase a55 0 03 h 1 demonstrating that the inoculum origin and temperature interfere with the substrate consumption rate mpn analysis indicated a growth of new cells in the srb group in the phases a30 a15 and n15 as well as the selection of species in the group and a decline in the population quantity in the phases n30 a55 and n55 according to the stabilized data at the end of each phase it can be inferred that both inoculums at different temperatures adapted to the conditions of the bioreactor as indicated by the ph increase and the sulfide production demonstrating that despite the operation at 30 c since adapted inoculum was the one with the greatest removal other conditions can be enhanced

14023,sulfide precipitation method has been widely used in the removal of arsenic and heavy metals from copper smelting waste acid nevertheless tiny metal sulfide particles are generated during the process making it difficult to achieve solid liquid separation as well as solid solid separation this study designed an innovative gravitational field flow fractionation gfff tank to effectively separate fine sulfide precipitate particles of different heavy metals relying on the difference in particle sizes to achieve better tank performance the effects of process conditions on the size variation of precipitate particles produced in metal sulfide precipitation process cu ⅱ zn ⅱ or as ⅲ were firstly investigated the results show that supersaturation level sulfide to metal molar ratio and ph have significant effects on the precipitate particle size while reaction time affects slightly the optimum conditions were identified to achieve the greatest possible differences in particle sizes of the three metal sulfide precipitates to further analyze its performance a 3d model of the gfff tank was built with the fluid flow field and precipitate particle movement simulated under the optimum conditions the simulation results demonstrate that the designed gfff tank can realize efficient separation of fine metal sulfide precipitates for the recovery of valuable metals keywords copper smelting waste acid gravitational field flow fractionation metal sulfide precipitates size variation fluid flow field particle movement 1 introduction copper smelting waste acid cswa with the characteristics of low ph and high levels of arsenic heavy metals as well as sulfates 1 brings about serious damage to the environment and human health 2 due to its high toxicity and bioaccumulation 3 therefore it must be treated before discharge to meet strict emission regulations 4 5 a number of methods have been applied in the removal of arsenic and heavy metals from cswa 6 including chemical precipitation 7 ion exchange 8 adsorption 9 electrochemistry processes 10 etc among these methods sulfide precipitation is widely employed in dealing with waste acid rich in arsenic and heavy metals in recent years owing to the low solubility and high stability of metal sulfides 11 12 compared with hydroxide precipitation 13 16 previously making effluent meet discharge standards was the principle of waste acid treatment therefore in the treatment of cswa using sulfide precipitation it focused mainly on the removal efficiency of arsenic and heavy metals from the waste acid which only transferred them from wastewater to waste residues producing a considerably large amount of residues 17 in addition arsenic and heavy metals all precipitated as a mixture of polymetallic sulfides causing a loss of valuable resources 15 with the need for environmental protection and economic development 18 it is necessary to reduce sludge production and reuse these valuable metals consequently arsenic and heavy metals must be separated from each other as well as from the waste acid 19 as an advanced method selective sulfide precipitation has been reported in many studies which is achieved by adjusting process parameters such as ph ps sulfide sources solution potential etc 12 20 24 based on the difference in solubility products of different metal sulfides nevertheless fine or colloidal particles for example cus 0 1 μm and zns 1 10 μm 25 are usually generated during the process of selective sulfide precipitation causing difficulty in solid liquid separation as well as solid solid separation through filtration or normal sedimentation due to their poor aggregation and settling performance 26 in order to overcome the difficulty of separating metal sulfide precipitates from the waste acid larger particle sizes of the precipitates are required dosing flocculants including inorganic flocculants e g pac pas pfc pfs and organic flocculants pam is a common way and the first choice to increase particle size whereas it introduces cations such as al3 fe3 etc into the waste acid 27 which may influence the effluent quality and increase sludge volume 28 besides some researchers proposed to utilize uv light irradiation to increase the aggregation and settling performance of metal sulfide particles which makes particle size increase over 100 fold 29 30 another approach is to find an appropriate device that can achieve both solid liquid separation and solid solid separation instead of taking measures to increase particle size field flow fractionation fff is a flow assisted technique suitable for the separation of small particles in the range of 1 nm 100 μm 31 in this method particles with different properties are fractionated utilizing a field force e g thermal electrical sedimentation asymmetrical flow perpendicular to the direction of elution in a thin channel when particles with different response sensibilities correspondingly reach their equilibrium positions in the channel where the flow state is laminar and the velocity distribution of the flow is parabolic they obtain different velocities in their respective positions in such conditions particles arrive at the outlet at different time intervals therefore fractionation of different particles can be accomplished depending on outlet time 32 fff method has been extensively applied in versatile fields including biotechnology nanotechnology polymer engineering and environmental engineering 33 36 to obtain valuable information about particles by coupling with different physical and chemical detectors 37 fff can be divided into four types according to the field force among which the gravitational fff gfff that utilizes the gravity of targeted particles perpendicular to the direction of a carrier liquid in the thin and banded channel to realize sedimentation of particles towards the accumulation wall is well suited for the separation and analysis of colloidal materials and macro molecules such as biological cells dry yeast starch nanoparticles 38 41 etc because of its simplicity and low cost therefore it is expected to separate various metal sulfide particles from each other in a gfff device taking advantage of the difference in particle sizes and densities this study designed a gfff tank suitable for separating fine metal sulfide particles from each other as well as from cswa to realize the recovery of valuable metals in the waste acid nevertheless the properties of sulfide precipitate particles are variable during the process and a fundamental study of precipitate particle size variation mechanism is required furthermore the design of process parameters of the gfff tank needs optimization it is usually expensive and time consuming to perform practical experiments considering the rapid development of computer science computational fluid dynamics cfd can effectively and conveniently reveal the complex physical phenomena and optimize the model by repetitive tests without consuming materials and costs the physical phenomena such as fluid flow and particle movement can be simulated analyzed and calculated accurately through computer simulation and numerical calculation 42 in recent years cfd has been applied in the field of environment for example f sanchez and co workers 43 established an activated sludge reactor model and simulated the biological processes in the treatment of waste acid peng et al 42 constructed a hydrodynamic separator model using cfd to optimize rainwater separation systems liu et al 44 modeled a filter with a series of flow filtration modes to simulate the process of dust deposition li et al 45 evaluated the performance of three designed continuously flow sulfide precipitation reactors cfspr during copper sulfide precipitation therefore it is convenient and intuitive for applying cfd into the simulation of fluid flow and particle behavior in the gfff tank to provide information for its optimal design in this study a gfff tank model was developed by comsol multiphysics software in the treatment of cswa using sulfide precipitation to simulate the process of separating fine precipitate particles from each other and achieve solid liquid separation as well as solid solid separation for the reuse of valuable metals in order to achieve the optimum performance of the tank a fundamental understanding of precipitate particle size variation mechanism under the influences of supersaturation level sl sulfide to metal s m molar ratio ph and reaction time is required as a result the present study investigated firstly the effects of different process conditions on the size of precipitate particles formed in the process of typical metal sulfide precipitation cu ⅱ zn ⅱ or as ⅲ to identify the optimum conditions that achieve the greatest possible differences in particle sizes of the three metal sulfide precipitates then based on the precipitate particles under optimum conditions the fluid flow field and particle movement in the gfff tank model built by cfd were simulated with the purpose of testing the separation efficiency of the designed gfff tank 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents all reagents cuso4 5h2o znso4 7h2o naaso2 na2s 9h2o naoh and h2so4 used in this study were of analytical grade purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china naoh and h2so4 were used for ph adjustment cuso4 5h2o znso4 7h2o naaso2 na2s 9h2o were used for the preparation of synthetic solutions and the initial concentrations of metal ions cu ⅱ zn ⅱ or as ⅲ and sulfide ions were confected into 10 g l and 16 g l respectively 2 2 experimental design a series of experiments in this study were carried out in a single metal system cu zn or as in a 2 0 l beaker with a reaction volume of 1 0 l at 20 the beaker was operated as a continuously stirred tank reactor using a magnetic stirrer which was set at 400 rpm in all cases and all experiments were conducted in the fuming cupboard in this study the concentration of metal ions in each experiment was at a relatively high level which was close to a realistic industrial concentration the experimental program consisted of three parts firstly an investigation into the effect of supersaturation level on particle size during sulfide precipitation process at a constant initial ph 1 and constant s m molar ratio cu zn and as were 1 1 1 1 and 3 2 respectively was carried out sl was changed by means of altering the concentrations of reactants and was calculated by eq 2 according to the reaction in eq 1 thus as shown in table 1 supersaturation levels of 3 11 1016 9 34 1015 and 3 11 1015 for copper sulfide precipitation 4 86 109 1 46 109 and 4 86 108 for zinc sulfide precipitation as well as 2 56 106 7 68 105 and 2 56 105 for arsenic sulfide precipitation were employed secondly the effect of sulfide to metal molar ratio on particle size was investigated experiments were conducted at different s m molar ratios while keeping initial ph 1 and sl cu zn and as were 9 34 1015 1 46 109 and 7 68 105 respectively constant in the case of cu ⅱ or zn ⅱ sulfide precipitation s m molar ratios of 0 5 1 1 1 1 2 1 and 2 1 were investigated and for as ⅲ sulfide precipitation the investigated s m molar ratios were 0 75 1 3 2 1 8 1 and 3 1 in the last part of the experiment program the effect of ph on particle size was studied when sl cu zn and as were 9 34 1015 1 46 109 and 7 68 105 respectively and s m molar ratio cu zn and as were 1 1 1 1 and 3 2 respectively were constant experiments at various ph values of 1 3 4 5 6 or 9 were performed 1 m m n a q n n m a q m m n n s 2 s m n m n m n k s p m n it is worth mentioning that the dosing method in the investigation of ph effect is different from the others in the variable experiments of sl or s m molar ratio a certain volume of metal ion solution and the na2s solution were simultaneously poured into a beaker at t 0 to obtain a mixing solution with desired concentrations of sulfide ions and metal ions and the ph value was monitored and read in real time with a ph detection electrode during the whole process samples were collected at specific time intervals immediately as soon as the reactants were mixed however the ph of the whole reaction process could not be controlled which had to be pre adjusted to a set value hence this method is not suitable for the investigation into the effect of ph on particle size and forward feed that allows metal ion solution and sodium sulfide solution to be pumped into a beaker at a respective set flow rate using peristaltic pump was used in ph effect experiments before mixing a certain volume of deionized water was added to the beaker and ph was adjusted to a set value using naoh or h2so4 during the dosing process ph was kept stable by instilling naoh or h2so4 manually besides sampling could only be conducted after dosing 2 3 sampling and analytical methods in each experiment a 50 ml suspension sample was withdrawn from the reactor at prescribed time intervals t 0 30 min 60 min 120 min 240 min which was immediately sent to determine the particle size of sulfide precipitates within 5 min using laser particle analyzer ls pop6 zhuhai omec instruments co ltd when the rest of the collected sample was stabilized and precipitate particles completely settled out 8 ml of the supernatant was collected with a syringe and then filtrated through a 0 45 μm pes membrane the total sulfide concentration was determined by the methylene blue method 46 using an ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer shanghai lingguang technology co ltd after 240 min the wet densities of the precipitate particles were measured using sucrose solution 47 and an appropriate amount of the precipitate was collected and filtrated with a suction filter to achieve solid liquid separation the obtained solid part was washed with deionized water and vacuum

ttriii rigaku corporation japan 3 results and discussion to obtain an understanding of variation mechanisms of the three metal sulfide precipitate particle sizes an investigation into the effects of supersaturation level sulfide to metal molar ration ph as well as reaction time on the sulfide precipitation process especially on precipitate particle size was carried out most importantly the optimal conditions that can realize the greatest discrepancy in sizes among cus zns and as2s3 precipitate particles were explored and employed in the subsequent simulation 3 1 the effect of supersaturation level on the sulfide precipitation process 3 1 1 copper sulfide precipitation in the process of copper sulfide precipitation when cuso4 and na2s were mixed dark blue precipitates were immediately formed which were all confirmed to be covellite cus by xrd under three levels of supersaturation fig 1 b some observations can be noticed during the process firstly the amount of the formed precipitates increased with sl increasing due to larger amounts of metal ions and sulfide ions existing in the solution when a higher level of supersaturation was employed however the settling performance had a negative correlation with the level of supersaturation through observation the supernatant after free sedimentation was clear with no apparent suspended small particles under the lower sl of 3 11 1015 the concentration of cu ⅱ was 0 5 g l secondly the ph value had a significant increase at the beginning of the reaction but kept stable over time it can be deduced that the sulfide reaction occurred quickly and almost no protons were released or consumed with time increasing fig 1a d exhibit the results of d50 xrd and sem eds of copper sulfide precipitate particles under three levels of supersaturation at ph 1 and the s cu molar ratio of 1 1 from fig 1a which illustrates the variation of d50 over time under different levels of supersaturation it can be observed that when the concentration of cu ⅱ as well as the sl decreases the precipitate particle size increases the particle sizes of the precipitates produced at the cu ⅱ concentration of 0 5 g l relatively have an apparent variation and the largest size is 5 2 μm at t 4 h while the largest sizes at cu ⅱ of 1 5 g l and 5 g l are 4 71 μm and 4 48 μm respectively it is in accordance with the settling performance mentioned above suggesting that larger particles have higher settling rates considering the pretty fast reaction rate and the relatively high level of supersaturation it can be deduced that it is crystal nucleation rather than crystal growth that accounts for the generation of fine particles besides crystal agglomeration may be the main mechanism for the increase of cus precipitate particle size nevertheless fig 1c shows that a vast majority of particles have sizes over 10 μm apparently larger than that in the solution it is probably because that the precipitates were dewatered and aggregated together in the vacuum freeze dried process moreover the growth rate of the particle size is fast before 1 h while it lowers down after 1 h especially for the cu ⅱ concentration of 0 5 g l it is probably because that the precipitate particles are unstable and have a tendency to aggregate together at the initial stage xrd patterns present that the precipitates of copper sulfide precipitation under three levels of supersaturation all consist mainly of cus the peak of cus is sharp and narrow indicating that the cus precipitate particles have high crystallinity when the level of supersaturation is relatively high the intensities of impure phase peaks increase which indicates that the amount of impure phases increases due to the difficulty of process controlling under such conditions the reason why cuso4 exists in the precipitate is that the produced precipitate was not washed clean with deionized water before it was vacuum freeze dried sem images show that the copper sulfide precipitate particles are irregularly shaped and the surface roughness varies indicating that the precipitate particles agglomerated during the process and the amorphous impurities adsorbed on the surface of crystalline cus the elemental distribution map also illustrates that the main chemical elements of the precipitates are cu and s with a little o 3 1 2 zinc sulfide precipitation for zinc sulfide precipitation once reactants were mixed up white sticky precipitates were produced immediately besides the variation tendency of the ph value is similar to that of copper sulfide precipitation nevertheless it is disgusting that a much more pungent smell was released during the process compared to copper sulfide precipitation resulting from the much higher solubility product of zns than that of cus that makes s2 escape from the acidic solution in the form of h2s fig 2 presents the d50 of zinc sulfide precipitate particles varies over time the xrd patterns under three levels of supersaturation as well as sem eds images of zinc sulfide particles during the zinc sulfide precipitation from fig 2a it can be seen that there is no data when the concentration of zn ⅱ is 0 5 g l sl of 4 86 108 which is due to that the amount of the produced particles was small and they seemed to be colloidal throughout the process resulting in shading ratio close to zero when measuring particle size on the contrary a large quantity of the precipitates were generated at the zn ⅱ concentration of 5 g l sl of 4 86 109 but the particle sizes were as small as about 0 60 μm and kept steady over time which is much smaller than that at the zn ⅱ concentration of 1 5 g l when the level of supersaturation is neither so high nor so low e g the zn ⅱ concentration of 1 5 g l the overall trend is that precipitate particle size increases over time with the largest d50 of 2 86 μm at t 4 h as seen in figs 1a and 2 a compared to the precipitates of copper sulfide precipitation the precipitates produced in zinc sulfide precipitation have smaller particle sizes in all cases which may result from a more negative surface charge for zns precipitates besides the particle size of copper sulfide precipitates varies within 2 μm over time fig 1a while the variation of zns precipitate particle size is slight implying that reaction time has a more remarkable effect on cus particle size than on zns particle size fig 2b illustrates that the produced precipitate is mostly made up of zns sphalerite with a small amount of znso4 the appearance of znso4 in the precipitate is due to the relatively small surface area of the formed fine zns causing that znso4 in the solution attached to the precipitate and was vacuum freeze dried together another observation from fig 2b is that several impure phase peaks exist in the patterns especially under the condition of 1 5 g l zn ⅱ which means that the impurities assume a certain proportion and the process was poorly controlled furthermore when the concentration of zn ⅱ is 5 g l sl of 4 86 109 the main peaks are slightly wide with low intensities accounting for the low crystallinity and fine precipitate particles fig 2c also demonstrates that the precipitate particle size is small and the flocculation ability is worse than that of cus from fig 2c it can be observed that most particles are crystallite with smooth surfaces although some are irregular shaped eds map shows that the main elements are zn s and o consistent with the results of xrd 3 1 3 arsenic sulfide precipitation the phenomenon of arsenic sulfide precipitation is similar to copper and zinc sulfide precipitation the amount of the yellow precipitates had a significant increase with sl increasing it also implies the fast reaction and homogeneous explosion nucleation at higher supersaturation levels as shown in fig 3 the precipitates of arsenic sulfide precipitation under three levels of supersaturation at ph 1 and the s ⅱ as ⅲ molar ratio of 3 2 was detected fig 3a describes the relationship between d50 and time under different levels of supersaturation as can be seen the variation of particle size is negligible over time at three supersaturation levels interestingly the precipitate particle sizes are extremely large at t 0 which can be considered as a measuring error in general the precipitate particle size has a relatively negative correlation with sl and the final particle sizes at t 4 h are 4 41 μm 3 93 μm and 1 42 μm for as ⅲ of 0 5 g l 1 5 g l and 5 g l respectively besides the effect of reaction time on the precipitate particle size can be negligible nevertheless some different and strange results appear in as ⅲ sulfide precipitation firstly different from the other researches that as ⅲ was removed in the form of as2s3 during the arsenic sulfide precipitation process 48 as2o3 arsenolite contributes to the most intense peak at all three levels of supersaturation confirmed by xrd fig 3b a reasonable explanation is that partly as2s3 precipitate particles are oxidized by o2 and convert into crystallized as2o3 nevertheless the primary elements are as and s instead of as and o secondly an interesting shape appears in the precipitates as shown in fig 3c the morphology of the analytical particle is apparently different at the two points one has an irregular shape with rough surface and the other is a cubic crystal with smooth surface combined with the results of eds fig 3d the content of o on the smooth surface is higher than that on the rough surface the contents of as and s are almost constant at the two points it can be deduced that the content on the rough surface is as2s3 while crystalline substance consists probably mainly of as2o3 the results showed above reveal that the as2o3 precipitate particles have a high degree of crystallinity but are not the major products of the arsenic sulfide precipitation on the contrary the amorphous as2s3 particles constitute the precipitate as stated above the supersaturation level of the solution has a significant effect on metal sulfide precipitate particles when the level of supersaturation increases the sizes of sulfide precipitate particles decrease but the crystallinity increases theoretically the process of crystallization consists of nucleation growth and aggregation when the level of supersaturation is quite high crystal nucleation takes precedence over crystal growth resulting in the generation of fine particles in terms of metal sulfide precipitation it is easy for the mixing solution to acquire a high level of supersaturation due to the pretty low solubilities of metal sulfides as a consequent homogeneous explosion nucleation is mainly responsible for the immediate generation of fine precipitate particles in addition the results also indicate that it is crystal agglomeration rather than crystal growth that makes a difference in the increase of particle size furthermore reaction time can slightly affect cus precipitate particle size while its effect on zns and as2s3 particle size can be neglected what s more the particle sizes of different metal sulfide precipitates under the same mass concentration of metal ions are discrepant particularly between cus and zns which is advantageous to the further separation theoretically the atomic masses of cus and zns are similar whereas the soluble product of zns is 14 magnitudes less than that of cus therefore at the same mass concentration zinc ions are more difficult to form metal sulfide precipitates than copper ions leading to more sulfur ions remained in the solution which is responsible for the increase of negative surface charge that suppresses particle aggregation 3 2 the effect of sulfide to metal molar ratio on the sulfide precipitation process 3 2 1 copper sulfide precipitation in the investigation into the effect of sulfide to metal molar ratio on precipitate particle size in copper sulfide precipitation the sulfide reagent was added insufficiently stoichiometrically or excessively that is the s cu molar ratio was 0 5 1 1 1 1 2 1 or 2 1 in all cases dark blue or dark precipitates were formed at the moment of reactants mixing the amount of the precipitate produced at the s cu molar ratio of 0 5 1 was distinctly smaller than that of the other three groups and the ph value shot up at the very beginning of mixing and then remained invariable which may be due to the fast reaction rate of the copper sulfide precipitation noting that ph at the s cu molar ratio of 2 1 had a greater variation than that of the others and stabilized at about 1 45 it is owing to that the excess free sulfide ions remained in the solution increased the alkalinity of the solution it is in agreement with the results of spectrophotometry which indicated that sulfide ions did not react completely with copper ions at s cu molar ratio of 2 1 the analytical results of sulfide precipitate particles under different s cu molar ratios are summarized in fig 4 from fig 4a some significant findings can be made firstly with time going the precipitate particle size varies slightly at the s cu molar ratios of 0 5 1 1 1 and 1 2 1 while it is kind of different at 2 1 which shows an apparent decrease before 60 min but an increase since 120 min secondly the difference in particle size under four s cu molar ratios is obviously great when the s cu molar ratio is 2 1 the particle sizes are much smaller and the minimum size is even less than 1 μm excess sulfide ions may dissociate copper sulfide precipitate particles to form solvable copper hydroxysulfate resulting in a decrease in particle size as well as precipitate amount another probable reason for smaller particle sizes at s cu molar ratio of 2 1 is that with the increase of sulfide ions the negative surface charge of precipitate particles increases which causes difficulty in agglomeration of precipitate particles when s cu molar ratio is 1 2 1 the precipitates have the largest particle size over 6 μm disagreed with the theory the particle size at the stoichiometric s cu molar ratio exhibits an unsatisfactory result which was smaller than that at the s cu molar ratio of 1 2 1 or 0 5 1 indicating that a slightly larger or smaller amount of sulfide reagent addition would be beneficial for the increase of precipitate particle size in this experiment it is due to that the interaction between copper sulfate solution and the sulfide regent can be more sufficient when the amount of added sulfide reagent is slightly larger or vice versa fig 4b indicates that the precipitate primarily consists of cus and has high crystallinity except for the s cu molar ratio of 2 1 besides the overall trend of the peak intensity is decreasing as the s cu molar ratio increases actually the difference of peak intensity among the s cu molar ratio of 0 5 1 1 1 and 1 2 1 is negligible whereas the peak intensities are apparently smaller at the s cu molar ratio of 2 1 in the range of measured angles suggesting that the precipitate under this condition is poorly crystalline with fine particle sizes combining with fig 4c the precipitate particles at the s cu molar ratio of 2 1 are floc fine granule and aggregate to form large particles the result of eds shows that the molar ratio of cu and s in the precipitates is approximately 1 1 corresponding with the results of xrd 3 2 2 zinc sulfide precipitation the selected sulfide to metal molar ration in zinc sulfide precipitation was the same as that in copper sulfide precipitation once znso4 and na2s were mixed a mass of milky white precipitates were generated as the s zn molar ratio was 1 1 or 2 1 while the solution at s zn molar ratio of 0 5 1 or 1 2 1 began colloidal after about one minute it is not clear why there is no large amount of precipitates at the s zn molar ratio of 1 2 1 what is worth mentioning is that the supernatant of samples was filtrated through a 0 22 μm pes membrane because of the formation of pretty fine precipitate particles the variation trend of ph was similar to that in copper sulfide precipitation which increased immediately once mixed and then maintained at around 1 35 1 35 1 43 and 1 51 for the s zn molar ratio of 0 5 1 1 1 1 2 1 and 2 1 respectively owing to the addition of alkaline sulfide solution the stable ph value increased as the s zn molar ratio increased fig 5 a demonstrates the relationship between particle size and reaction time as well as sulfide to zinc molar ratio because the amount of the precipitates formed is too small to reach the required shading ratio the particle size could not be detected when the s zn molar ratio is 0 5 1 or 1 2 1 as presented in fig 5a a notable contrast exists between the s zn of 1 1 and 2 1 on one hand the particle sizes at the s zn molar ratio of 1 1 are above 2 μm all the time while that of s zn molar ratio 2 1 are always below 1 μm it is probably due to that excess s2 adsorbed on the surface of the precipitate particles and thus made it difficult to aggregate together on the other hand the variation trend is also disparate before 60 min when the s zn molar ratio is 1 1 the particle size increases with time increasing until 30 min followed by a decrease from 30 min to 60 min while the trend is completely opposite before 60 min at the s zn molar ratio of 2 1 a reasonable explanation for the decrease of precipitate particle size at the s zn molar ratio of 2 1 is that the excess s2 reacted with zns making zns re dissolved and the increase of particle size may be owing to the aggregation of the formed precipitate particles xrd patterns in fig 5b show that the precipitate is composed mainly of zns and zinc sulfate hydrate on account of the tiny precipitate particles with large specific surface area the impurities including zinc sulfate hydrate on the surface of the precipitates were not washed off which were detected by xrd fig 5c presents the sem image of the precipitate particles at the s zn molar ratio of 2 1 which are porous and floc with large sizes similar to the sem result at the s zn molar ratio of 1 2 1 not shown while the precipitate particles have smooth surfaces when the s zn molar ratios are 0 5 1 and 1 1 whose morphology is similar to the image shown in fig 2c it is probably the adherence of s2 to the precipitates and the h2s formation in the excess s2 condition that make it porous and loosened eds map illustrates that the major elements are zn and s 3 2 3 arsenic sulfide precipitation as for arsenic sulfide precipitation the s ⅱ as ⅲ molar ratios of 0 75 1 3 2 1 8 1 and 3 1 meaning that the na2s excess coefficients are 0 5 1 1 2 and 2 respectively were investigated similarly when naaso2 mixed up with na2s large quantities of yellow precipitates are produced in four groups of experiments during the process of arsenic sulfide precipitation at four different molar ratios the ph value kept rising before 30 min and then kept stable however the stable ph values increased with the increased s ⅱ as ⅲ molar ratios which were approximately 1 37 1 60 1 62 and 2 01 for s ⅱ as ⅲ molar ratio of 0 75 1 3 2 1 8 1 and 3 1 respectively created by the addition of alkaline sulfide solution it can be noticed that the stable ph values are larger than that in copper and zinc sulfide precipitation possibly because that as ⅲ exists as alkaline aso2 in the solution according to the variation of particle size over time under different s ⅱ as ⅲ molar ratios fig 6 a the precipitate particle sizes at the s ⅱ as ⅲ molar ratio of 3 1 are the smallest and keep nearly invariable at about 2 25 μm since 60 min compared with the particle sizes in the other three cases it exhibits a more desired result when the s ⅱ as ⅲ molar ratio was stoichiometric that is s ⅱ as ⅲ molar ratio of 3 2 the phenomenon at 0 75 1 resembled that at 3 2 which both has a peak distributed at t 30 min as well as t 120 min although the particle sizes at 3 2 were slightly larger than that at 0 75 1 however at the s ⅱ as ⅲ molar ratio of 1 8 1 the particle size increases sharply and reaches a peak at t 30 min after the maximum the particle size starts to decrease gradually which could be neglected fig 6b plots the xrd patterns at four s ⅱ as ⅲ molar ratios where some observations can be made firstly similar to the results of the investigation into the effect of sl on the arsenic sulfide precipitation fig 3b d it can be deduced that the main product of the arsenic sulfide precipitation is amorphous as2s3 furthermore the crystallinity of precipitate particles at the s ⅱ as ⅲ molar ratio of 3 2 is distinctly higher than that of the others combined with fig 6a the precipitate particles produced under the condition of s ⅱ as ⅲ molar ratio 3 2 obtain the best characteristic with large particle sizes and a high degree of crystallinity fig 6d indicates that the distribution of elements is uneven on the surface of the precipitate particles for example the mass of as at point 4 is significantly larger than that of the others and the point 9 has more o and na but with less as than that of the other points implying that impurities with different components adsorbed on the surface of the precipitate particles according to the experimental results the sizes of precipitate particles produced in the process of cu ⅱ sulfide precipitation are the largest at the s cu molar ratio of 1 2 1 besides visible differences can be observed at different s cu molar ratios nevertheless in the process of zn ⅱ or as ⅲ sulfide precipitation the particle sizes are similar at the na2s excess coefficients of 0 5 1 and 1 2 which are relatively larger than that at the na2s excess coefficients of 2 through the results discussed above the overall variation mechanism could be that both the size and crystallinity of the formed precipitate particles decrease as the sulfide to metal molar ratio increases especially at a relatively high s m molar ratio the sizes of precipitate particles are not satisfactory which are particularly small erratic and amorphous it is possible because that the negative surface charge increases with the increase of sulfide ions resulting in the difficulty in agglomeration of precipitate particles 49 it is also reasonable that the excess sulfide ions make metal sulfide re dissolved to form aqueous polysulfide complexes causing a decrease in particle size and amount therefore when the sulfide to metal molar ratio is below the stoichiometric ratio e g 0 5 0 8 the interaction between the reactants is sufficient leading to incomplete chemical reaction and low reaction efficiency when the sulfide to metal molar ratio is too high e g 1 5 2 fine precipitate particles are produced which can cause troubles in subsequent separation processes and may be even re dissolved in the practical application the amount of sulfide reagent is usually slightly excessive for a higher reaction efficiency in conclusion controlling s m molar ratio to be stoichiometric or slightly excessive is necessary in order to obtain larger particle sizes and ensure higher reaction efficiency 3 3 the effect of ph on the sulfide precipitation process in the exploration into the effect of ph on the sulfide precipitation process the feeding method was different from the other two variable experiments which was that reactants were added slowly through a peristaltic pump to control the ph of the whole process in addition sampling was implemented immediately after dosing the results are described as follows 3 3 1 copper sulfide precipitation during the dosing of cuso4 and na2s the ph of the mixed solution was controlled at 1 3 4 5 6 or 9 all the time once the reactants contacted a mass of dark blue precipitates were generated and the volume of the precipitate increased with dosing when all of the reactants were added a 50 ml sample was withdrawn to detect the precipitate particle size which was summarized in fig 7 a b as shown in fig 7a b the particle size distributions psds under the ph values of 1 and 9 are similar and show the smallest sizes which are mostly between 3 50 μm and 5 13 μm but the psd under ph 9 is more intensive in this range than that under ph 1 furthermore the psd is nearly the same and demonstrates a better result under ph 3 6 which illustrates that more than 98 of the precipitate particles distribute at 5 11 μm from fig 7a it is clear that the curve is very gentle under ph between 3 and 6 indicating that the particle size is almost invariable at ph 3 6 although the particle size exhibits a little twist at ph 4 5 therefore it can demonstrate that ph exerts a remarkable effect on copper sulfide precipitate particles at ph 3 and it is not necessary to keep increasing ph for larger particle sizes fig 7c describes the xrd patterns of precipitate particles at different ph values the patterns imply that the major substance in the precipitate is cus moreover it can be observed that with ph increasing the intensities of the peaks all lower down indicating a decrease in the degree of crystallinity nevertheless the degree of crystallinity cannot reflect the particle size of the precipitate for example as seen in fig 7a and c xrd pattern shows fine crystallinity but the particle sizes are small at ph 1 xrd indicates a low crystallinity and the particle sizes are still small at ph 9 fig 7d presents the sem images of precipitate particles at ph 4 5 and ph 6 whose morphologies of the produced precipitates are disparate at ph 4 5 the precipitate particles mostly have compact shapes with high crystallinity as well as smooth surface although a very small amount of the precipitates are floc and amorphous oppositely when the value of ph is 6 the shapes of the precipitate particles are irregular with rough surfaces furthermore it exists an obvious agglomeration to form larger particles 3 3 2 zinc sulfide precipitation during the dosing process the ph value of the mixed solution was controlled at 1 3 4 5 6 or 9 using h2so4 and naoh similarly a number of white sulfide precipitates were formed at the moment that the reactants contacted and the volume of the precipitate increased with dosing except for the ph of 9 which had nearly no precipitates it is reasonable because zinc sulfide is soluble in an alkaline aqueous solution fortunately the ph control in the whole process is effortless at all ph values in the zinc sulfide precipitation compared to copper or arsenic sulfide precipitation after dosing a 50 ml sample was collected to measure precipitate particle size and the rest precipitate was washed with deionized water centrifuged and vacuum freeze dried for other detections as presented in fig 8 a b d50 of zinc sulfide precipitate particles has a rising trend as the ph value increases and reaches the maximum at ph 4 5 when the ph value keeps increasing to 6 the particle size decreases slightly within 0 1 μm the overall variation trend of cus and zns particle size with ph is similar nevertheless the largest particle size can be obtained at ph 3 6 for cus precipitates but at ph 4 5 6 for zns precipitates fig 8 b presents that the psd at ph 1 is rather dispersive compared to the other ph values whose highest differential distribution is beyond 15 at particle size of about 3 5 μm while the differential distribution of the others reaches up to 30 at even larger particle sizes although d50 at ph 3 is smaller than the cases of ph 4 5 and 6 the psd mode is narrower and has a more concentrated distribution xrd patterns illustrate that the main product of zinc sulfide precipitation is zns combined with sem images in fig 8d the formed precipitate is sheet or clubbed composed of pure zns and has fine crystallinity with smooth surfaces at ph 4 5 nevertheless the morphology of produced precipitates is complex which has irregular shapes with a smooth surface or is sheet with a porous surface the precipitate with smooth surface is confirmed to be pure zns by eds not shown while on the porous surface the mass of zinc is smaller than that of sulfur which is not clear what substance it is 3 3 3 arsenic sulfide precipitation in the case of arsenic sulfide precipitation the ph value of the mixed solution was controlled at 1 3 4 5 6 or 9 by h2so4 and naoh during the whole process it was similar to the phenomenon in zinc sulfide precipitation that the mixing solution was obviously clear with no precipitates at ph 9 because arsenic sulfide is soluble in an alkaline solution when the dosing was finished a 50 ml sample was taken from the solution aiming to measure the sizes of sulfide precipitates as shown in fig 9 a b d50 increases with the ph value increasing and obtains a maximum size between ph 3 and 4 5 and starts to decline as ph increases until the solution is alkaline that no precipitates were generated it is obvious that the precipitate particle sizes at ph 6 are extremely small in comparison to the others but its psd is more concentrated actually the psd at ph 3 and 4 5 is rather similar and their subtle variation in d50 can be ignored as for the result of ph 1 though the medium diameter is not the smallest the precipitate particle size distribution is the most dispersed xrd patterns demonstrate that the major phase of arsenic sulfide precipitation is as2o3 however at ph 3 4 5 and 6 the peaks of as2o3 and as2s3 barely appear in the patterns while the eds maps not shown indicate that as and s account for a large proportion of the precipitates it can be deduced that as2o3 and as2s3 exist in the precipitates but have pretty poor crystallinity causing that no obvious peaks appear the morphology of the precipitate is amorphous and floc with large particle sizes in all cases as shown in fig 9d which may result from crystal agglomeration the results discussed above show that it is beneficial for cu ⅱ zn ⅱ and as ⅲ to be settled out in an acidic condition especially at ph 4 5 in sulfide precipitation processes as the value of ph increases to 4 5 the precipitate particle size has a trend of increasing in all three cases actually the type of sulfur species is strongly affected by ph as shown in eqs 3 and 4 which suggest that under acidic conditions the decrease of ph value results in an increase of h2s and a decrease of hs and s2 50 karbanee and co workers 51 proposed that bisulfide ions also participate the precipitation of metal sulfides which can be described as eq 5 and eq 6 therefore at ph values below 6 a rise in ph increases the amounts of hs and s2 that are available for the precipitation reaction when the ph value above 6 is employed the precipitate particle size declines it may be due to the increase in negative surface charge that suppresses the aggregation 3 h 2 s a q h s a q h a q p k 1 6 99 4 h s a q s 2 a q h a q p k 2 17 4 5 m 2 a q s 2 a q m s s 6 m 2 a q h s a q m s s h a q 4 cfd numerical simulation of the gfff tank considering the difficulty in separation of metal sulfide precipitate particles from each other and from the waste acid in the process of sulfide precipitation a gfff tank was designed to make sure a more thorough separation of complex precipitates combined with selective sulfide precipitation method various heavy metal sulfide precipitates were expected to be further separated from each other in the gfff tank taking advantage of their particle size differences before putting it into practice to testify its performance it is necessary to simulate the behavior of the three metal sulfide precipitate particles in the gfff tank model built by the cfd numerical method in the batch experiments discussed above the effects of different parameters on the process of cu ⅱ zn ⅱ and as ⅲ sulfide precipitation especially on the particle size variation of sulfide precipitates were explored the experimental data of each factor were analyzed to find the particle size variation of each metal sulfide precipitate then through a comprehensive analysis including the consideration of selective sulfide precipitation that needs different operation ph values for each metal sulfide precipitation the actual settling performances of the three metal sulfide precipitates the effects of the explored factors on the sulfide precipitation process and the comparison among the three metal sulfide precipitate particles the optimal conditions were identified which can provide the largest possible differences in particle size among the three metal sulfide precipitates as a consequence the precipitate particles applied in the subsequent simulation were cus zns and as2s3 with sizes of 8 μm 2 μm and 5 μm respectively which can be produced under the optimal conditions listed in table 2 the results of the cfd simulation are described as follows 4 1 geometry and mesh in the traditional field flow fractionation system the length to height ratio needs to be sufficiently large to obtain a laminar flow in the channel in the design process we preliminarily determined the height of the gfff tank which is 0 05 m according to the stokes law the settling velocities of the three metal sulfide precipitates were calculated then the time needed for each metal sulfide precipitate to settle to the bottom of the tank was calculated respectively in order to ensure one type of metal sulfide precipitate settle to the bottom of the tank with the other two metal sulfide precipitates flowing out of the tank the length of the tank was designed to be 2 5 m according to the time calculation above therefore the resulting length to height ratio is 50 1 furthermore the width of the tank was preliminarily determined as 0 2 m based on a small flow rate of 8 m3 day in addition two gfff tank structures were designed which have differences in the settlement trough one has a hexahedron shaped settlement trough with slopes on both sides which is described in section 4 1 geometry and mesh and shown in fig 10 a the other has no slopes on both sides of the settlement tough fig 11 geometry this novel gfff tank includes a main flat cuboid fractionation channel a settlement trough and three attached pipes as shown in fig 10 a with a three dimensional coordinate system the main flat cuboid channel is 2 5 m in length 0 2 m in width and 0 05 m in height the settlement trough is a hexahedron with slopes on both sides which is 1 5 m in length and attached 0 4 m away from the water inlet the cross section of the settlement trough is a trapezoid with an upper width of 0 2 m a lower width of 0 1 m and a height of 0 05 m the three attached pipes include a water inflow pipe an outflow pipe and a sediment inflow pipe which are all 0 05 m in diameter and 0 1 m in length the axes of the water inflow pipe and the outflow pipe are in the y direction with their coordinates of x 0 m y 2 9 m and x 0 m y 0 4 m respectively the axis of sediment inflow pipe is in the z direction with its coordinates of x 0 m and y 2 85 m mesh the model in this study discretizes the gfff tank into tetrahedral mesh elements as shown in fig 10 b the maximum element size in the domain is 0 0565 m and the minimum size in the domain is 0 0169 m furthermore the maximum element growth rate is 1 2 and the curvature factor is 0 7 due to higher accuracy requirements two layers of finer elements are integrated into the existing tetrahedral mesh elements in the model along all surface boundaries the first layer thickness is 0 0012 μm and the boundary layer stretching factor is 1 2 the maximum cell size of the triangular boundary element is 0 0299 m the minimum cell size is 0 00565 m and the maximum cell growth rate is 1 13 after achieving a grid independent test the complete mesh of the model consists of 134 289 domain elements 17 792 boundary elements and 1578 edge elements 4 2 governing equation laminar flow and particle movement in fluid flow are coupled in the model

other faces 14 u 0 where u is the fluid velocity vector as for the metal sulfide particles those approaching the bottom faces of the settlement trough are governed by eq 15 15 up 0 where the speed of the metal sulfide precipitate particles striking the wall drops to zero and adheres to the wall surface in this model three hundred metal sulfide precipitate particles including 100 cus particles 100 zns particles and 100 as2s3 particles were uniformly released at t 0 s from the sediment inlet face with their initial velocities governed by the fluid flow field according to stokes law the settling velocity can be calculated by eq 16 when the initial inflow velocity is set in the range of 0 0025 0 01 m s the largest particles settle into the settlement trough while the others flow out of the tank which can be separated from each other through different outlet time in addition at initial inflow velocity below 0 0022 m s theoretical calculation particles can also achieve separation by means of making cus and as2s3 particles settle out but zns particles flow out the settled particles can be fractionated according to their different positions in the trough after a series of simulation experiments with different initial inflow velocities 0 01 m s was confirmed to the optimum velocity 16 u t d 2 ρ p ρ g 18 μ furthermore the size and density of the precipitate particles are the most important parameters in the settling process it was found that the wet density of the precipitate particles under different conditions was very close which indicates that the wet density of metal sulfide particle varies slightly with the growing precipitate particle size it is due to that the crystal agglomeration is the main mechanism for the particle size increase causing the precipitate particles to be flocculent and porous consequently a certain density of each metal sulfide precipitate was identified in the simulation the model parameters are specified in table 3 which includes the main parameters and boundary conditions applied in the simulation 4 4 simulation analysis in the gfff tank model fig 12 a e present the streamline and velocity distributions of the velocity field at five time points in the gfff tank model which are represented by color magnitude mol m3 s and red vector arrows respectively the movement trajectories of metal sulfide precipitate particles in the flat cuboid fractionation channel at different times are shown in fig 13 a g the gfff tank was initially filled with water flow with the designed velocity of 0 01 m s and cus zns as well as as2s3 particles were released simultaneously from the sediment inlet at t 0 s as shown in figs 12a and 13 a at t 10 s most velocity vectors of water flow in the upper area of the whole fractionation channel are along the y axis while they are exactly in the opposite direction in the lower area which causes the formation of eddies in the whole fractionation channel besides the magnitude of opposite velocity vectors increases along the y axis resulting in a larger eddy in the channel close to the outlet as a result particles moved forward along the upper wall driven by the large fluid force at t 100 s figs 12b and 13 b the eddy still exists in most areas of the channel but the flow velocities as well as the magnitudes of streamline distributions are smaller than that at t 10 s in addition the velocity vectors are all along the y axis in the small area of the channel close to water flow inlet which makes flow stable in this area this streamline distribution causes the division that about 20 particles each of the three metal sulfide particles is about 20 move faster than the others as shown in fig 13b as presented in figs 12c and 13 c the stable area expands to the middle of the channel while the latter part remains a low degree of chaos moreover the three metal sulfide particles began to show a fractionation in height due to their different sizes and densities from fig 13d it can be seen that the streamline and velocity distributions are even with merely a relatively small eddy in latter area of the channel at t 300 s besides cus particles in the 20 particles mentioned above started to settle into the settlement trough since t 300 s fig 13d and a vast majority of cus particles settled to the bottom of the tank at t 900 s fig 13f gradually the fluid flowed in a completely stable and laminar state after 500 s fig 13e as shown in fig 13a g it can be noticed that the distance between as2s3 particles green ones and zns particles blue ones becomes farther and farther with time going which is advantageous to separate the two types of particles from each other as presented in fig 13g at t 1400s almost all of as2s3 particles flowed out of the tank while zns particles still kept flowing in the tank thus it is useful to separate as2s3 and zns particles from each other according to efflux time consequently it can be concluded that cus as2s3 and zns fine precipitate particles with different sizes and densities can be separated from each other in the gfff tank furthermore the separation efficiencies of the three precipitate particles are 95 75 and 75 respectively 5 conclusions an innovative gfff device was designed to achieve the purpose of effective solid liquid separation as well as solid solid separation during the sulfide precipitation process of cswa treatment in order to achieve the best performance of the tank the effects of supersaturation level sulfide to metal molar ratio ph as well as reaction time on the precipitate particle size during the metal sulfide precipitation in a single metal system cu ⅱ zn ⅱ or as ⅲ were investigated the optimum process conditions were identified for the greatest discrepancy in particle sizes of the three metal sulfide precipitate furthermore a cfd model was built to simulate the fluid flow field and precipitate particle movement in the gfff tank under the optimum conditions as well as to evaluate its separation efficiency of fine metal sulfide particles with different particle sizes 1 it was found that the precipitate particle size increases with the decrease of the supersaturation level a high level of supersaturation makes crystal nucleation rather than crystal growth predominant during sulfide precipitation resulting in the generation of fine precipitate particles furthermore under the same mass concentration of cu ⅱ zn ⅱ and as ⅲ cus precipitates has the largest growth rate and particle sizes followed by the as2s3 and zns precipitates 2 when the sulfide to metal molar ratio is smaller or slightly larger than the stoichiometric ratio its influence on the precipitate particle size is not significant nevertheless excessive addition of sulfide ions e g na2s excess coefficient of 2 has a remarkable effect of shrinking the precipitate particle size this may be attributed to the adsorption of s2 on the precipitate particles which suppresses the agglomeration of the particles 3 acid conditions are beneficial to particle size control during metal sulfide precipitation process especially at ph 4 5 when the value of ph is below 4 5 precipitate particle size increases sharply as ph increases for cus and zns precipitate particles but it varies slightly for as2s3 particles 4 it can be concluded that reaction time has a slight effect on the precipitate particle size particularly for zinc and arsenic sulfide precipitates 5 in the simulation the designed gfff tank can effectively separate fine metal sulfide particles from each other based on the difference in their particle sizes under appropriate process conditions 95 cus particles 8 μm could settle to the bottom of the gfff tank which could be further collected from the settlement trough as2s3 particles 5 μm could be separated from zns particles 2 μm owing to their different time intervals flowing out of the tank and the separation efficiencies of as2s3 and zns both are 75 acknowledgement this work was

14023,sulfide precipitation method has been widely used in the removal of arsenic and heavy metals from copper smelting waste acid nevertheless tiny metal sulfide particles are generated during the process making it difficult to achieve solid liquid separation as well as solid solid separation this study designed an innovative gravitational field flow fractionation gfff tank to effectively separate fine sulfide precipitate particles of different heavy metals relying on the difference in particle sizes to achieve better tank performance the effects of process conditions on the size variation of precipitate particles produced in metal sulfide precipitation process cu ⅱ zn ⅱ or as ⅲ were firstly investigated the results show that supersaturation level sulfide to metal molar ratio and ph have significant effects on the precipitate particle size while reaction time affects slightly the optimum conditions were identified to achieve the greatest possible differences in particle sizes of the three metal sulfide precipitates to further analyze its performance a 3d model of the gfff tank was built with the fluid flow field and precipitate particle movement simulated under the optimum conditions the simulation results demonstrate that the designed gfff tank can realize efficient separation of fine metal sulfide precipitates for the recovery of valuable metals keywords copper smelting waste acid gravitational field flow fractionation metal sulfide precipitates size variation fluid flow field particle movement 1 introduction copper smelting waste acid cswa with the characteristics of low ph and high levels of arsenic heavy metals as well as sulfates 1 brings about serious damage to the environment and human health 2 due to its high toxicity and bioaccumulation 3 therefore it must be treated before discharge to meet strict emission regulations 4 5 a number of methods have been applied in the removal of arsenic and heavy metals from cswa 6 including chemical precipitation 7 ion exchange 8 adsorption 9 electrochemistry processes 10 etc among these methods sulfide precipitation is widely employed in dealing with waste acid rich in arsenic and heavy metals in recent years owing to the low solubility and high stability of metal sulfides 11 12 compared with hydroxide precipitation 13 16 previously making effluent meet discharge standards was the principle of waste acid treatment therefore in the treatment of cswa using sulfide precipitation it focused mainly on the removal efficiency of arsenic and heavy metals from the waste acid which only transferred them from wastewater to waste residues producing a considerably large amount of residues 17 in addition arsenic and heavy metals all precipitated as a mixture of polymetallic sulfides causing a loss of valuable resources 15 with the need for environmental protection and economic development 18 it is necessary to reduce sludge production and reuse these valuable metals consequently arsenic and heavy metals must be separated from each other as well as from the waste acid 19 as an advanced method selective sulfide precipitation has been reported in many studies which is achieved by adjusting process parameters such as ph ps sulfide sources solution potential etc 12 20 24 based on the difference in solubility products of different metal sulfides nevertheless fine or colloidal particles for example cus 0 1 μm and zns 1 10 μm 25 are usually generated during the process of selective sulfide precipitation causing difficulty in solid liquid separation as well as solid solid separation through filtration or normal sedimentation due to their poor aggregation and settling performance 26 in order to overcome the difficulty of separating metal sulfide precipitates from the waste acid larger particle sizes of the precipitates are required dosing flocculants including inorganic flocculants e g pac pas pfc pfs and organic flocculants pam is a common way and the first choice to increase particle size whereas it introduces cations such as al3 fe3 etc into the waste acid 27 which may influence the effluent quality and increase sludge volume 28 besides some researchers proposed to utilize uv light irradiation to increase the aggregation and settling performance of metal sulfide particles which makes particle size increase over 100 fold 29 30 another approach is to find an appropriate device that can achieve both solid liquid separation and solid solid separation instead of taking measures to increase particle size field flow fractionation fff is a flow assisted technique suitable for the separation of small particles in the range of 1 nm 100 μm 31 in this method particles with different properties are fractionated utilizing a field force e g thermal electrical sedimentation asymmetrical flow perpendicular to the direction of elution in a thin channel when particles with different response sensibilities correspondingly reach their equilibrium positions in the channel where the flow state is laminar and the velocity distribution of the flow is parabolic they obtain different velocities in their respective positions in such conditions particles arrive at the outlet at different time intervals therefore fractionation of different particles can be accomplished depending on outlet time 32 fff method has been extensively applied in versatile fields including biotechnology nanotechnology polymer engineering and environmental engineering 33 36 to obtain valuable information about particles by coupling with different physical and chemical detectors 37 fff can be divided into four types according to the field force among which the gravitational fff gfff that utilizes the gravity of targeted particles perpendicular to the direction of a carrier liquid in the thin and banded channel to realize sedimentation of particles towards the accumulation wall is well suited for the separation and analysis of colloidal materials and macro molecules such as biological cells dry yeast starch nanoparticles 38 41 etc because of its simplicity and low cost therefore it is expected to separate various metal sulfide particles from each other in a gfff device taking advantage of the difference in particle sizes and densities this study designed a gfff tank suitable for separating fine metal sulfide particles from each other as well as from cswa to realize the recovery of valuable metals in the waste acid nevertheless the properties of sulfide precipitate particles are variable during the process and a fundamental study of precipitate particle size variation mechanism is required furthermore the design of process parameters of the gfff tank needs optimization it is usually expensive and time consuming to perform practical experiments considering the rapid development of computer science computational fluid dynamics cfd can effectively and conveniently reveal the complex physical phenomena and optimize the model by repetitive tests without consuming materials and costs the physical phenomena such as fluid flow and particle movement can be simulated analyzed and calculated accurately through computer simulation and numerical calculation 42 in recent years cfd has been applied in the field of environment for example f sanchez and co workers 43 established an activated sludge reactor model and simulated the biological processes in the treatment of waste acid peng et al 42 constructed a hydrodynamic separator model using cfd to optimize rainwater separation systems liu et al 44 modeled a filter with a series of flow filtration modes to simulate the process of dust deposition li et al 45 evaluated the performance of three designed continuously flow sulfide precipitation reactors cfspr during copper sulfide precipitation therefore it is convenient and intuitive for applying cfd into the simulation of fluid flow and particle behavior in the gfff tank to provide information for its optimal design in this study a gfff tank model was developed by comsol multiphysics software in the treatment of cswa using sulfide precipitation to simulate the process of separating fine precipitate particles from each other and achieve solid liquid separation as well as solid solid separation for the reuse of valuable metals in order to achieve the optimum performance of the tank a fundamental understanding of precipitate particle size variation mechanism under the influences of supersaturation level sl sulfide to metal s m molar ratio ph and reaction time is required as a result the present study investigated firstly the effects of different process conditions on the size of precipitate particles formed in the process of typical metal sulfide precipitation cu ⅱ zn ⅱ or as ⅲ to identify the optimum conditions that achieve the greatest possible differences in particle sizes of the three metal sulfide precipitates then based on the precipitate particles under optimum conditions the fluid flow field and particle movement in the gfff tank model built by cfd were simulated with the purpose of testing the separation efficiency of the designed gfff tank 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents all reagents cuso4 5h2o znso4 7h2o naaso2 na2s 9h2o naoh and h2so4 used in this study were of analytical grade purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china naoh and h2so4 were used for ph adjustment cuso4 5h2o znso4 7h2o naaso2 na2s 9h2o were used for the preparation of synthetic solutions and the initial concentrations of metal ions cu ⅱ zn ⅱ or as ⅲ and sulfide ions were confected into 10 g l and 16 g l respectively 2 2 experimental design a series of experiments in this study were carried out in a single metal system cu zn or as in a 2 0 l beaker with a reaction volume of 1 0 l at 20 the beaker was operated as a continuously stirred tank reactor using a magnetic stirrer which was set at 400 rpm in all cases and all experiments were conducted in the fuming cupboard in this study the concentration of metal ions in each experiment was at a relatively high level which was close to a realistic industrial concentration the experimental program consisted of three parts firstly an investigation into the effect of supersaturation level on particle size during sulfide precipitation process at a constant initial ph 1 and constant s m molar ratio cu zn and as were 1 1 1 1 and 3 2 respectively was carried out sl was changed by means of altering the concentrations of reactants and was calculated by eq 2 according to the reaction in eq 1 thus as shown in table 1 supersaturation levels of 3 11 1016 9 34 1015 and 3 11 1015 for copper sulfide precipitation 4 86 109 1 46 109 and 4 86 108 for zinc sulfide precipitation as well as 2 56 106 7 68 105 and 2 56 105 for arsenic sulfide precipitation were employed secondly the effect of sulfide to metal molar ratio on particle size was investigated experiments were conducted at different s m molar ratios while keeping initial ph 1 and sl cu zn and as were 9 34 1015 1 46 109 and 7 68 105 respectively constant in the case of cu ⅱ or zn ⅱ sulfide precipitation s m molar ratios of 0 5 1 1 1 1 2 1 and 2 1 were investigated and for as ⅲ sulfide precipitation the investigated s m molar ratios were 0 75 1 3 2 1 8 1 and 3 1 in the last part of the experiment program the effect of ph on particle size was studied when sl cu zn and as were 9 34 1015 1 46 109 and 7 68 105 respectively and s m molar ratio cu zn and as were 1 1 1 1 and 3 2 respectively were constant experiments at various ph values of 1 3 4 5 6 or 9 were performed 1 m m n a q n n m a q m m n n s 2 s m n m n m n k s p m n it is worth mentioning that the dosing method in the investigation of ph effect is different from the others in the variable experiments of sl or s m molar ratio a certain volume of metal ion solution and the na2s solution were simultaneously poured into a beaker at t 0 to obtain a mixing solution with desired concentrations of sulfide ions and metal ions and the ph value was monitored and read in real time with a ph detection electrode during the whole process samples were collected at specific time intervals immediately as soon as the reactants were mixed however the ph of the whole reaction process could not be controlled which had to be pre adjusted to a set value hence this method is not suitable for the investigation into the effect of ph on particle size and forward feed that allows metal ion solution and sodium sulfide solution to be pumped into a beaker at a respective set flow rate using peristaltic pump was used in ph effect experiments before mixing a certain volume of deionized water was added to the beaker and ph was adjusted to a set value using naoh or h2so4 during the dosing process ph was kept stable by instilling naoh or h2so4 manually besides sampling could only be conducted after dosing 2 3 sampling and analytical methods in each experiment a 50 ml suspension sample was withdrawn from the reactor at prescribed time intervals t 0 30 min 60 min 120 min 240 min which was immediately sent to determine the particle size of sulfide precipitates within 5 min using laser particle analyzer ls pop6 zhuhai omec instruments co ltd when the rest of the collected sample was stabilized and precipitate particles completely settled out 8 ml of the supernatant was collected with a syringe and then filtrated through a 0 45 μm pes membrane the total sulfide concentration was determined by the methylene blue method 46 using an ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer shanghai lingguang technology co ltd after 240 min the wet densities of the precipitate particles were measured using sucrose solution 47 and an appropriate amount of the precipitate was collected and filtrated with a suction filter to achieve solid liquid separation the obtained solid part was washed with deionized water and vacuum freeze dried for solid phase characterization including scanning electron microscope and energy disperse spectroscopy sem eds jsm it300la jeol japan as well as x ray powder diffraction xrd rigaku ttriii rigaku corporation japan 3 results and discussion to obtain an understanding of variation mechanisms of the three metal sulfide precipitate particle sizes an investigation into the effects of supersaturation level sulfide to metal molar ration ph as well as reaction time on the sulfide precipitation process especially on precipitate particle size was carried out most importantly the optimal conditions that can realize the greatest discrepancy in sizes among cus zns and as2s3 precipitate particles were explored and employed in the subsequent simulation 3 1 the effect of supersaturation level on the sulfide precipitation process 3 1 1 copper sulfide precipitation in the process of copper sulfide precipitation when cuso4 and na2s were mixed dark blue precipitates were immediately formed which were all confirmed to be covellite cus by xrd under three levels of supersaturation fig 1 b some observations can be noticed during the process firstly the amount of the formed precipitates increased with sl increasing due to larger amounts of metal ions and sulfide ions existing in the solution when a higher level of supersaturation was employed however the settling performance had a negative correlation with the level of supersaturation through observation the supernatant after free sedimentation was clear with no apparent suspended small particles under the lower sl of 3 11 1015 the concentration of cu ⅱ was 0 5 g l secondly the ph value had a significant increase at the beginning of the reaction but kept stable over time it can be deduced that the sulfide reaction occurred quickly and almost no protons were released or consumed with time increasing fig 1a d exhibit the results of d50 xrd and sem eds of copper sulfide precipitate particles under three levels of supersaturation at ph 1 and the s cu molar ratio of 1 1 from fig 1a which illustrates the variation of d50 over time under different levels of supersaturation it can be observed that when the concentration of cu ⅱ as well as the sl decreases the precipitate particle size increases the particle sizes of the precipitates produced at the cu ⅱ concentration of 0 5 g l relatively have an apparent variation and the largest size is 5 2 μm at t 4 h while the largest sizes at cu ⅱ of 1 5 g l and 5 g l are 4 71 μm and 4 48 μm respectively it is in accordance with the settling performance mentioned above suggesting that larger particles have higher settling rates considering the pretty fast reaction rate and the relatively high level of supersaturation it can be deduced that it is crystal nucleation rather than crystal growth that accounts for the generation of fine particles besides crystal agglomeration may be the main mechanism for the increase of cus precipitate particle size nevertheless fig 1c shows that a vast majority of particles have sizes over 10 μm apparently larger than that in the solution it is probably because that the precipitates were dewatered and aggregated together in the vacuum freeze dried process moreover the growth rate of the particle size is fast before 1 h while it lowers down after 1 h especially for the cu ⅱ concentration of 0 5 g l it is probably because that the precipitate particles are unstable and have a tendency to aggregate together at the initial stage xrd patterns present that the precipitates of copper sulfide precipitation under three levels of supersaturation all consist mainly of cus the peak of cus is sharp and narrow indicating that the cus precipitate particles have high crystallinity when the level of supersaturation is relatively high the intensities of impure phase peaks increase which indicates that the amount of impure phases increases due to the difficulty of process controlling under such conditions the reason why cuso4 exists in the precipitate is that the produced precipitate was not washed clean with deionized water before it was vacuum freeze dried sem images show that the copper sulfide precipitate particles are irregularly shaped and the surface roughness varies indicating that the precipitate particles agglomerated during the process and the amorphous impurities adsorbed on the surface of crystalline cus the elemental distribution map also illustrates that the main chemical elements of the precipitates are cu and s with a little o 3 1 2 zinc sulfide precipitation for zinc sulfide precipitation once reactants were mixed up white sticky precipitates were produced immediately besides the variation tendency of the ph value is similar to that of copper sulfide precipitation nevertheless it is disgusting that a much more pungent smell was released during the process compared to copper sulfide precipitation resulting from the much higher solubility product of zns than that of cus that makes s2 escape from the acidic solution in the form of h2s fig 2 presents the d50 of zinc sulfide precipitate particles varies over time the xrd patterns under three levels of supersaturation as well as sem eds images of zinc sulfide particles during the zinc sulfide precipitation from fig 2a it can be seen that there is no data when the concentration of zn ⅱ is 0 5 g l sl of 4 86 108 which is due to that the amount of the produced particles was small and they seemed to be colloidal throughout the process resulting in shading ratio close to zero when measuring particle size on the contrary a large quantity of the precipitates were generated at the zn ⅱ concentration of 5 g l sl of 4 86 109 but the particle sizes were as small as about 0 60 μm and kept steady over time which is much smaller than that at the zn ⅱ concentration of 1 5 g l when the level of supersaturation is neither so high nor so low e g the zn ⅱ concentration of 1 5 g l the overall trend is that precipitate particle size increases over time with the largest d50 of 2 86 μm at t 4 h as seen in figs 1a and 2 a compared to the precipitates of copper sulfide precipitation the precipitates produced in zinc sulfide precipitation have smaller particle sizes in all cases which may result from a more negative surface charge for zns precipitates besides the particle size of copper sulfide precipitates varies within 2 μm over time fig 1a while the variation of zns precipitate particle size is slight implying that reaction time has a more remarkable effect on cus particle size than on zns particle size fig 2b illustrates that the produced precipitate is mostly made up of zns sphalerite with a small amount of znso4 the appearance of znso4 in the precipitate is due to the relatively small surface area of the formed fine zns causing that znso4 in the solution attached to the precipitate and was vacuum freeze dried together another observation from fig 2b is that several impure phase peaks exist in the patterns especially under the condition of 1 5 g l zn ⅱ which means that the impurities assume a certain proportion and the process was poorly controlled furthermore when the concentration of zn ⅱ is 5 g l sl of 4 86 109 the main peaks are slightly wide with low intensities accounting for the low crystallinity and fine precipitate particles fig 2c also demonstrates that the precipitate particle size is small and the flocculation ability is worse than that of cus from fig 2c it can be observed that most particles are crystallite with smooth surfaces although some are irregular shaped eds map shows that the main elements are zn s and o consistent with the results of xrd 3 1 3 arsenic sulfide precipitation the phenomenon of arsenic sulfide precipitation is similar to copper and zinc sulfide precipitation the amount of the yellow precipitates had a significant increase with sl increasing it also implies the fast reaction and homogeneous explosion nucleation at higher supersaturation levels as shown in fig 3 the precipitates of arsenic sulfide precipitation under three levels of supersaturation at ph 1 and the s ⅱ as ⅲ molar ratio of 3 2 was detected fig 3a describes the relationship between d50 and time under different levels of supersaturation as can be seen the variation of particle size is negligible over time at three supersaturation levels interestingly the precipitate particle sizes are extremely large at t 0 which can be considered as a measuring error in general the precipitate particle size has a relatively negative correlation with sl and the final particle sizes at t 4 h are 4 41 μm 3 93 μm and 1 42 μm for as ⅲ of 0 5 g l 1 5 g l and 5 g l respectively besides the effect of reaction time on the precipitate particle size can be negligible nevertheless some different and strange results appear in as ⅲ sulfide precipitation firstly different from the other researches that as ⅲ was removed in the form of as2s3 during the arsenic sulfide precipitation process 48 as2o3 arsenolite contributes to the most intense peak at all three levels of supersaturation confirmed by xrd fig 3b a reasonable explanation is that partly as2s3 precipitate particles are oxidized by o2 and convert into crystallized as2o3 nevertheless the primary elements are as and s instead of as and o secondly an interesting shape appears in the precipitates as shown in fig 3c the morphology of the analytical particle is apparently different at the two points one has an irregular shape with rough surface and the other is a cubic crystal with smooth surface combined with the results of eds fig 3d the content of o on the smooth surface is higher than that on the rough surface the contents of as and s are almost constant at the two points it can be deduced that the content on the rough surface is as2s3 while crystalline substance consists probably mainly of as2o3 the results showed above reveal that the as2o3 precipitate particles have a high degree of crystallinity but are not the major products of the arsenic sulfide precipitation on the contrary the amorphous as2s3 particles constitute the precipitate as stated above the supersaturation level of the solution has a significant effect on metal sulfide precipitate particles when the level of supersaturation increases the sizes of sulfide precipitate particles decrease but the crystallinity increases theoretically the process of crystallization consists of nucleation growth and aggregation when the level of supersaturation is quite high crystal nucleation takes precedence over crystal growth resulting in the generation of fine particles in terms of metal sulfide precipitation it is easy for the mixing solution to acquire a high level of supersaturation due to the pretty low solubilities of metal sulfides as a consequent homogeneous explosion nucleation is mainly responsible for the immediate generation of fine precipitate particles in addition the results also indicate that it is crystal agglomeration rather than crystal growth that makes a difference in the increase of particle size furthermore reaction time can slightly affect cus precipitate particle size while its effect on zns and as2s3 particle size can be neglected what s more the particle sizes of different metal sulfide precipitates under the same mass concentration of metal ions are discrepant particularly between cus and zns which is advantageous to the further separation theoretically the atomic masses of cus and zns are similar whereas the soluble product of zns is 14 magnitudes less than that of cus therefore at the same mass concentration zinc ions are more difficult to form metal sulfide precipitates than copper ions leading to more sulfur ions remained in the solution which is responsible for the increase of negative surface charge that suppresses particle aggregation 3 2 the effect of sulfide to metal molar ratio on the sulfide precipitation process 3 2 1 copper sulfide precipitation in the investigation into the effect of sulfide to metal molar ratio on precipitate particle size in copper sulfide precipitation the sulfide reagent was added insufficiently stoichiometrically or excessively that is the s cu molar ratio was 0 5 1 1 1 1 2 1 or 2 1 in all cases dark blue or dark precipitates were formed at the moment of reactants mixing the amount of the precipitate produced at the s cu molar ratio of 0 5 1 was distinctly smaller than that of the other three groups and the ph value shot up at the very beginning of mixing and then remained invariable which may be due to the fast reaction rate of the copper sulfide precipitation noting that ph at the s cu molar ratio of 2 1 had a greater variation than that of the others and stabilized at about 1 45 it is owing to that the excess free sulfide ions remained in the solution increased the alkalinity of the solution it is in agreement with the results of spectrophotometry which indicated that sulfide ions did not react completely with copper ions at s cu molar ratio of 2 1 the analytical results of sulfide precipitate particles under different s cu molar ratios are summarized in fig 4 from fig 4a some significant findings can be made firstly with time going the precipitate particle size varies slightly at the s cu molar ratios of 0 5 1 1 1 and 1 2 1 while it is kind of different at 2 1 which shows an apparent decrease before 60 min but an increase since 120 min secondly the difference in particle size under four s cu molar ratios is obviously great when the s cu molar ratio is 2 1 the particle sizes are much smaller and the minimum size is even less than 1 μm excess sulfide ions may dissociate copper sulfide precipitate particles to form solvable copper hydroxysulfate resulting in a decrease in particle size as well as precipitate amount another probable reason for smaller particle sizes at s cu molar ratio of 2 1 is that with the increase of sulfide ions the negative surface charge of precipitate particles increases which causes difficulty in agglomeration of precipitate particles when s cu molar ratio is 1 2 1 the precipitates have the largest particle size over 6 μm disagreed with the theory the particle size at the stoichiometric s cu molar ratio exhibits an unsatisfactory result which was smaller than that at the s cu molar ratio of 1 2 1 or 0 5 1 indicating that a slightly larger or smaller amount of sulfide reagent addition would be beneficial for the increase of precipitate particle size in this experiment it is due to that the interaction between copper sulfate solution and the sulfide regent can be more sufficient when the amount of added sulfide reagent is slightly larger or vice versa fig 4b indicates that the precipitate primarily consists of cus and has high crystallinity except for the s cu molar ratio of 2 1 besides the overall trend of the peak intensity is decreasing as the s cu molar ratio increases actually the difference of peak intensity among the s cu molar ratio of 0 5 1 1 1 and 1 2 1 is negligible whereas the peak intensities are apparently smaller at the s cu molar ratio of 2 1 in the range of measured angles suggesting that the precipitate under this condition is poorly crystalline with fine particle sizes combining with fig 4c the precipitate particles at the s cu molar ratio of 2 1 are floc fine granule and aggregate to form large particles the result of eds shows that the molar ratio of cu and s in the precipitates is approximately 1 1 corresponding with the results of xrd 3 2 2 zinc sulfide precipitation the selected sulfide to metal molar ration in zinc sulfide precipitation was the same as that in copper sulfide precipitation once znso4 and na2s were mixed a mass of milky white precipitates were generated as the s zn molar ratio was 1 1 or 2 1 while the solution at s zn molar ratio of 0 5 1 or 1 2 1 began colloidal after about one minute it is not clear why there is no large amount of precipitates at the s zn molar ratio of 1 2 1 what is worth mentioning is that the supernatant of samples was filtrated through a 0 22 μm pes membrane because of the formation of pretty fine precipitate particles the variation trend of ph was similar to that in copper sulfide precipitation which increased immediately once mixed and then maintained at around 1 35 1 35 1 43 and 1 51 for the s zn molar ratio of 0 5 1 1 1 1 2 1 and 2 1 respectively owing to the addition of alkaline sulfide solution the stable ph value increased as the s zn molar ratio increased fig 5 a demonstrates the relationship between particle size and reaction time as well as sulfide to zinc molar ratio because the amount of the precipitates formed is too small to reach the required shading ratio the particle size could not be detected when the s zn molar ratio is 0 5 1 or 1 2 1 as presented in fig 5a a notable contrast exists between the s zn of 1 1 and 2 1 on one hand the particle sizes at the s zn molar ratio of 1 1 are above 2 μm all the time while that of s zn molar ratio 2 1 are always below 1 μm it is probably due to that excess s2 adsorbed on the surface of the precipitate particles and thus made it difficult to aggregate together on the other hand the variation trend is also disparate before 60 min when the s zn molar ratio is 1 1 the particle size increases with time increasing until 30 min followed by a decrease from 30 min to 60 min while the trend is completely opposite before 60 min at the s zn molar ratio of 2 1 a reasonable explanation for the decrease of precipitate particle size at the s zn molar ratio of 2 1 is that the excess s2 reacted with zns making zns re dissolved and the increase of particle size may be owing to the aggregation of the formed precipitate particles xrd patterns in fig 5b show that the precipitate is composed mainly of zns and zinc sulfate hydrate on account of the tiny precipitate particles with large specific surface area the impurities including zinc sulfate hydrate on the surface of the precipitates were not washed off which were detected by xrd fig 5c presents the sem image of the precipitate particles at the s zn molar ratio of 2 1 which are porous and floc with large sizes similar to the sem result at the s zn molar ratio of 1 2 1 not shown while the precipitate particles have smooth surfaces when the s zn molar ratios are 0 5 1 and 1 1 whose morphology is similar to the image shown in fig 2c it is probably the adherence of s2 to the precipitates and the h2s formation in the excess s2 condition that make it porous and loosened eds map illustrates that the major elements are zn and s 3 2 3 arsenic sulfide precipitation as for arsenic sulfide precipitation the s ⅱ as ⅲ molar ratios of 0 75 1 3 2 1 8 1 and 3 1 meaning that the na2s excess coefficients are 0 5 1 1 2 and 2 respectively were investigated similarly when naaso2 mixed up with na2s large quantities of yellow precipitates are produced in four groups of experiments during the process of arsenic sulfide precipitation at four different molar ratios the ph value kept rising before 30 min and then kept stable however the stable ph values increased with the increased s ⅱ as ⅲ molar ratios which were approximately 1 37 1 60 1 62 and 2 01 for s ⅱ as ⅲ molar ratio of 0 75 1 3 2 1 8 1 and 3 1 respectively created by the addition of alkaline sulfide solution it can be noticed that the stable ph values are larger than that in copper and zinc sulfide precipitation possibly because that as ⅲ exists as alkaline aso2 in the solution according to the variation of particle size over time under different s ⅱ as ⅲ molar ratios fig 6 a the precipitate particle sizes at the s ⅱ as ⅲ molar ratio of 3 1 are the smallest and keep nearly invariable at about 2 25 μm since 60 min compared with the particle sizes in the other three cases it exhibits a more desired result when the s ⅱ as ⅲ molar ratio was stoichiometric that is s ⅱ as ⅲ molar ratio of 3 2 the phenomenon at 0 75 1 resembled that at 3 2 which both has a peak distributed at t 30 min as well as t 120 min although the particle sizes at 3 2 were slightly larger than that at 0 75 1 however at the s ⅱ as ⅲ molar ratio of 1 8 1 the particle size increases sharply and reaches a peak at t 30 min after the maximum the particle size starts to decrease gradually which could be neglected fig 6b plots the xrd patterns at four s ⅱ as ⅲ molar ratios where some observations can be made firstly similar to the results of the investigation into the effect of sl on the arsenic sulfide precipitation fig 3b d it can be deduced that the main product of the arsenic sulfide precipitation is amorphous as2s3 furthermore the crystallinity of precipitate particles at the s ⅱ as ⅲ molar ratio of 3 2 is distinctly higher than that of the others combined with fig 6a the precipitate particles produced under the condition of s ⅱ as ⅲ molar ratio 3 2 obtain the best characteristic with large particle sizes and a high degree of crystallinity fig 6d indicates that the distribution of elements is uneven on the surface of the precipitate particles for example the mass of as at point 4 is significantly larger than that of the others and the point 9 has more o and na but with less as than that of the other points implying that impurities with different components adsorbed on the surface of the precipitate particles according to the experimental results the sizes of precipitate particles produced in the process of cu ⅱ sulfide precipitation are the largest at the s cu molar ratio of 1 2 1 besides visible differences can be observed at different s cu molar ratios nevertheless in the process of zn ⅱ or as ⅲ sulfide precipitation the particle sizes are similar at the na2s excess coefficients of 0 5 1 and 1 2 which are relatively larger than that at the na2s excess coefficients of 2 through the results discussed above the overall variation mechanism could be that both the size and crystallinity of the formed precipitate particles decrease as the sulfide to metal molar ratio increases especially at a relatively high s m molar ratio the sizes of precipitate particles are not satisfactory which are particularly small erratic and amorphous it is possible because that the negative surface charge increases with the increase of sulfide ions resulting in the difficulty in agglomeration of precipitate particles 49 it is also reasonable that the excess sulfide ions make metal sulfide re dissolved to form aqueous polysulfide complexes causing a decrease in particle size and amount therefore when the sulfide to metal molar ratio is below the stoichiometric ratio e g 0 5 0 8 the interaction between the reactants is sufficient leading to incomplete chemical reaction and low reaction efficiency when the sulfide to metal molar ratio is too high e g 1 5 2 fine precipitate particles are produced which can cause troubles in subsequent separation processes and may be even re dissolved in the practical application the amount of sulfide reagent is usually slightly excessive for a higher reaction efficiency in conclusion controlling s m molar ratio to be stoichiometric or slightly excessive is necessary in order to obtain larger particle sizes and ensure higher reaction efficiency 3 3 the effect of ph on the sulfide precipitation process in the exploration into the effect of ph on the sulfide precipitation process the feeding method was different from the other two variable experiments which was that reactants were added slowly through a peristaltic pump to control the ph of the whole process in addition sampling was implemented immediately after dosing the results are described as follows 3 3 1 copper sulfide precipitation during the dosing of cuso4 and na2s the ph of the mixed solution was controlled at 1 3 4 5 6 or 9 all the time once the reactants contacted a mass of dark blue precipitates were generated and the volume of the precipitate increased with dosing when all of the reactants were added a 50 ml sample was withdrawn to detect the precipitate particle size which was summarized in fig 7 a b as shown in fig 7a b the particle size distributions psds under the ph values of 1 and 9 are similar and show the smallest sizes which are mostly between 3 50 μm and 5 13 μm but the psd under ph 9 is more intensive in this range than that under ph 1 furthermore the psd is nearly the same and demonstrates a better result under ph 3 6 which illustrates that more than 98 of the precipitate particles distribute at 5 11 μm from fig 7a it is clear that the curve is very gentle under ph between 3 and 6 indicating that the particle size is almost invariable at ph 3 6 although the particle size exhibits a little twist at ph 4 5 therefore it can demonstrate that ph exerts a remarkable effect on copper sulfide precipitate particles at ph 3 and it is not necessary to keep increasing ph for larger particle sizes fig 7c describes the xrd patterns of precipitate particles at different ph values the patterns imply that the major substance in the precipitate is cus moreover it can be observed that with ph increasing the intensities of the peaks all lower down indicating a decrease in the degree of crystallinity nevertheless the degree of crystallinity cannot reflect the particle size of the precipitate for example as seen in fig 7a and c xrd pattern shows fine crystallinity but the particle sizes are small at ph 1 xrd indicates a low crystallinity and the particle sizes are still small at ph 9 fig 7d presents the sem images of precipitate particles at ph 4 5 and ph 6 whose morphologies of the produced precipitates are disparate at ph 4 5 the precipitate particles mostly have compact shapes with high crystallinity as well as smooth surface although a very small amount of the precipitates are floc and amorphous oppositely when the value of ph is 6 the shapes of the precipitate particles are irregular with rough surfaces furthermore it exists an obvious agglomeration to form larger particles 3 3 2 zinc sulfide precipitation during the dosing process the ph value of the mixed solution was controlled at 1 3 4 5 6 or 9 using h2so4 and naoh similarly a number of white sulfide precipitates were formed at the moment that the reactants contacted and the volume of the precipitate increased with dosing except for the ph of 9 which had nearly no precipitates it is reasonable because zinc sulfide is soluble in an alkaline aqueous solution fortunately the ph control in the whole process is effortless at all ph values in the zinc sulfide precipitation compared to copper or arsenic sulfide precipitation after dosing a 50 ml sample was collected to measure precipitate particle size and the rest precipitate was washed with deionized water centrifuged and vacuum freeze dried for other detections as presented in fig 8 a b d50 of zinc sulfide precipitate particles has a rising trend as the ph value increases and reaches the maximum at ph 4 5 when the ph value keeps increasing to 6 the particle size decreases slightly within 0 1 μm the overall variation trend of cus and zns particle size with ph is similar nevertheless the largest particle size can be obtained at ph 3 6 for cus precipitates but at ph 4 5 6 for zns precipitates fig 8 b presents that the psd at ph 1 is rather dispersive compared to the other ph values whose highest differential distribution is beyond 15 at particle size of about 3 5 μm while the differential distribution of the others reaches up to 30 at even larger particle sizes although d50 at ph 3 is smaller than the cases of ph 4 5 and 6 the psd mode is narrower and has a more concentrated distribution xrd patterns illustrate that the main product of zinc sulfide precipitation is zns combined with sem images in fig 8d the formed precipitate is sheet or clubbed composed of pure zns and has fine crystallinity with smooth surfaces at ph 4 5 nevertheless the morphology of produced precipitates is complex which has irregular shapes with a smooth surface or is sheet with a porous surface the precipitate with smooth surface is confirmed to be pure zns by eds not shown while on the porous surface the mass of zinc is smaller than that of sulfur which is not clear what substance it is 3 3 3 arsenic sulfide precipitation in the case of arsenic sulfide precipitation the ph value of the mixed solution was controlled at 1 3 4 5 6 or 9 by h2so4 and naoh during the whole process it was similar to the phenomenon in zinc sulfide precipitation that the mixing solution was obviously clear with no precipitates at ph 9 because arsenic sulfide is soluble in an alkaline solution when the dosing was finished a 50 ml sample was taken from the solution aiming to measure the sizes of sulfide precipitates as shown in fig 9 a b d50 increases with the ph value increasing and obtains a maximum size between ph 3 and 4 5 and starts to decline as ph increases until the solution is alkaline that no precipitates were generated it is obvious that the precipitate particle sizes at ph 6 are extremely small in comparison to the others but its psd is more concentrated actually the psd at ph 3 and 4 5 is rather similar and their subtle variation in d50 can be ignored as for the result of ph 1 though the medium diameter is not the smallest the precipitate particle size distribution is the most dispersed xrd patterns demonstrate that the major phase of arsenic sulfide precipitation is as2o3 however at ph 3 4 5 and 6 the peaks of as2o3 and as2s3 barely appear in the patterns while the eds maps not shown indicate that as and s account for a large proportion of the precipitates it can be deduced that as2o3 and as2s3 exist in the precipitates but have pretty poor crystallinity causing that no obvious peaks appear the morphology of the precipitate is amorphous and floc with large particle sizes in all cases as shown in fig 9d which may result from crystal agglomeration the results discussed above show that it is beneficial for cu ⅱ zn ⅱ and as ⅲ to be settled out in an acidic condition especially at ph 4 5 in sulfide precipitation processes as the value of ph increases to 4 5 the precipitate particle size has a trend of increasing in all three cases actually the type of sulfur species is strongly affected by ph as shown in eqs 3 and 4 which suggest that under acidic conditions the decrease of ph value results in an increase of h2s and a decrease of hs and s2 50 karbanee and co workers 51 proposed that bisulfide ions also participate the precipitation of metal sulfides which can be described as eq 5 and eq 6 therefore at ph values below 6 a rise in ph increases the amounts of hs and s2 that are available for the precipitation reaction when the ph value above 6 is employed the precipitate particle size declines it may be due to the increase in negative surface charge that suppresses the aggregation 3 h 2 s a q h s a q h a q p k 1 6 99 4 h s a q s 2 a q h a q p k 2 17 4 5 m 2 a q s 2 a q m s s 6 m 2 a q h s a q m s s h a q 4 cfd numerical simulation of the gfff tank considering the difficulty in separation of metal sulfide precipitate particles from each other and from the waste acid in the process of sulfide precipitation a gfff tank was designed to make sure a more thorough separation of complex precipitates combined with selective sulfide precipitation method various heavy metal sulfide precipitates were expected to be further separated from each other in the gfff tank taking advantage of their particle size differences before putting it into practice to testify its performance it is necessary to simulate the behavior of the three metal sulfide precipitate particles in the gfff tank model built by the cfd numerical method in the batch experiments discussed above the effects of different parameters on the process of cu ⅱ zn ⅱ and as ⅲ sulfide precipitation especially on the particle size variation of sulfide precipitates were explored the experimental data of each factor were analyzed to find the particle size variation of each metal sulfide precipitate then through a comprehensive analysis including the consideration of selective sulfide precipitation that needs different operation ph values for each metal sulfide precipitation the actual settling performances of the three metal sulfide precipitates the effects of the explored factors on the sulfide precipitation process and the comparison among the three metal sulfide precipitate particles the optimal conditions were identified which can provide the largest possible differences in particle size among the three metal sulfide precipitates as a consequence the precipitate particles applied in the subsequent simulation were cus zns and as2s3 with sizes of 8 μm 2 μm and 5 μm respectively which can be produced under the optimal conditions listed in table 2 the results of the cfd simulation are described as follows 4 1 geometry and mesh in the traditional field flow fractionation system the length to height ratio needs to be sufficiently large to obtain a laminar flow in the channel in the design process we preliminarily determined the height of the gfff tank which is 0 05 m according to the stokes law the settling velocities of the three metal sulfide precipitates were calculated then the time needed for each metal sulfide precipitate to settle to the bottom of the tank was calculated respectively in order to ensure one type of metal sulfide precipitate settle to the bottom of the tank with the other two metal sulfide precipitates flowing out of the tank the length of the tank was designed to be 2 5 m according to the time calculation above therefore the resulting length to height ratio is 50 1 furthermore the width of the tank was preliminarily determined as 0 2 m based on a small flow rate of 8 m3 day in addition two gfff tank structures were designed which have differences in the settlement trough one has a hexahedron shaped settlement trough with slopes on both sides which is described in section 4 1 geometry and mesh and shown in fig 10 a the other has no slopes on both sides of the settlement tough fig 11 geometry this novel gfff tank includes a main flat cuboid fractionation channel a settlement trough and three attached pipes as shown in fig 10 a with a three dimensional coordinate system the main flat cuboid channel is 2 5 m in length 0 2 m in width and 0 05 m in height the settlement trough is a hexahedron with slopes on both sides which is 1 5 m in length and attached 0 4 m away from the water inlet the cross section of the settlement trough is a trapezoid with an upper width of 0 2 m a lower width of 0 1 m and a height of 0 05 m the three attached pipes include a water inflow pipe an outflow pipe and a sediment inflow pipe which are all 0 05 m in diameter and 0 1 m in length the axes of the water inflow pipe and the outflow pipe are in the y direction with their coordinates of x 0 m y 2 9 m and x 0 m y 0 4 m respectively the axis of sediment inflow pipe is in the z direction with its coordinates of x 0 m and y 2 85 m mesh the model in this study discretizes the gfff tank into tetrahedral mesh elements as shown in fig 10 b the maximum element size in the domain is 0 0565 m and the minimum size in the domain is 0 0169 m furthermore the maximum element growth rate is 1 2 and the curvature factor is 0 7 due to higher accuracy requirements two layers of finer elements are integrated into the existing tetrahedral mesh elements in the model along all surface boundaries the first layer thickness is 0 0012 μm and the boundary layer stretching factor is 1 2 the maximum cell size of the triangular boundary element is 0 0299 m the minimum cell size is 0 00565 m and the maximum cell growth rate is 1 13 after achieving a grid independent test the complete mesh of the model consists of 134 289 domain elements 17 792 boundary elements and 1578 edge elements 4 2 governing equation laminar flow and particle movement in fluid flow are coupled in the model for solving the fluid velocity field and the particle trajectory the fluid flow is governed by the continuity and momentum equations 7 ρ u 0 8 ρ u u p μ u u t f where ρ is the fluid density u is the fluid velocity vector p is the pressure μ is the dynamic viscosity f is the body force vector per unit volume acting on the fluid the metal sulfide precipitate particle transport in the fluid flow was simulated by applying the steady state solution of the fluid flow field the effects of metal sulfide particles on the fluid flow are neglected due to their small masses the motion of a metal sulfide particle in the gfff tank is governed by newton s second law 9 m ⅆ 2 x ⅆ t 2 f 0 t x ⅆ x ⅆ t where x is the position of the particle m is the particle s mass and f0 is the sum of all forces acting on the particle the drag force on a metal sulfide particle is determined by stokes law 10 f d 18 μ m ρ p d 2 p u u p the following equation expresses the gravity and buoyancy forces on a metal sulfide particle 11 f z ρ p ρ g u p where fd is the drag force vector on a metal sulfide particle g is the acceleration of gravity m dp ρp up are the mass diameter density and velocity vector of the metal sulfide particle u is the velocity vector of the fluid and μ is the fluid viscosity 4 3 boundary conditions the boundary conditions of the inlet faces are described by the eq 12 12 u uo where uo is the specified inflow velocity which is shown in table 3 for all inlets the boundary conditions at the outlet face were described as follows 13 u uo n no slip wall boundary condition applied on all other faces 14 u 0 where u is the fluid velocity vector as for the metal sulfide particles those approaching the bottom faces of the settlement trough are governed by eq 15 15 up 0 where the speed of the metal sulfide precipitate particles striking the wall drops to zero and adheres to the wall surface in this model three hundred metal sulfide precipitate particles including 100 cus particles 100 zns particles and 100 as2s3 particles were uniformly released at t 0 s from the sediment inlet face with their initial velocities governed by the fluid flow field according to stokes law the settling velocity can be calculated by eq 16 when the initial inflow velocity is set in the range of 0 0025 0 01 m s the largest particles settle into the settlement trough while the others flow out of the tank which can be separated from each other through different outlet time in addition at initial inflow velocity below 0 0022 m s theoretical calculation particles can also achieve separation by means of making cus and as2s3 particles settle out but zns particles flow out the settled particles can be fractionated according to their different positions in the trough after a series of simulation experiments with different initial inflow velocities 0 01 m s was confirmed to the optimum velocity 16 u t d 2 ρ p ρ g 18 μ furthermore the size and density of the precipitate particles are the most important parameters in the settling process it was found that the wet density of the precipitate particles under different conditions was very close which indicates that the wet density of metal sulfide particle varies slightly with the growing precipitate particle size it is due to that the crystal agglomeration is the main mechanism for the particle size increase causing the precipitate particles to be flocculent and porous consequently a certain density of each metal sulfide precipitate was identified in the simulation the model parameters are specified in table 3 which includes the main parameters and boundary conditions applied in the simulation 4 4 simulation analysis in the gfff tank model fig 12 a e present the streamline and velocity distributions of the velocity field at five time points in the gfff tank model which are represented by color magnitude mol m3 s and red vector arrows respectively the movement trajectories of metal sulfide precipitate particles in the flat cuboid fractionation channel at different times are shown in fig 13 a g the gfff tank was initially filled with water flow with the designed velocity of 0 01 m s and cus zns as well as as2s3 particles were released simultaneously from the sediment inlet at t 0 s as shown in figs 12a and 13 a at t 10 s most velocity vectors of water flow in the upper area of the whole fractionation channel are along the y axis while they are exactly in the opposite direction in the lower area which causes the formation of eddies in the whole fractionation channel besides the magnitude of opposite velocity vectors increases along the y axis resulting in a larger eddy in the channel close to the outlet as a result particles moved forward along the upper wall driven by the large fluid force at t 100 s figs 12b and 13 b the eddy still exists in most areas of the channel but the flow velocities as well as the magnitudes of streamline distributions are smaller than that at t 10 s in addition the velocity vectors are all along the y axis in the small area of the channel close to water flow inlet which makes flow stable in this area this streamline distribution causes the division that about 20 particles each of the three metal sulfide particles is about 20 move faster than the others as shown in fig 13b as presented in figs 12c and 13 c the stable area expands to the middle of the channel while the latter part remains a low degree of chaos moreover the three metal sulfide particles began to show a fractionation in height due to their different sizes and densities from fig 13d it can be seen that the streamline and velocity distributions are even with merely a relatively small eddy in latter area of the channel at t 300 s besides cus particles in the 20 particles mentioned above started to settle into the settlement trough since t 300 s fig 13d and a vast majority of cus particles settled to the bottom of the tank at t 900 s fig 13f gradually the fluid flowed in a completely stable and laminar state after 500 s fig 13e as shown in fig 13a g it can be noticed that the distance between as2s3 particles green ones and zns particles blue ones becomes farther and farther with time going which is advantageous to separate the two types of particles from each other as presented in fig 13g at t 1400s almost all of as2s3 particles flowed out of the tank while zns particles still kept flowing in the tank thus it is useful to separate as2s3 and zns particles from each other according to efflux time consequently it can be concluded that cus as2s3 and zns fine precipitate particles with different sizes and densities can be separated from each other in the gfff tank furthermore the separation efficiencies of the three precipitate particles are 95 75 and 75 respectively 5 conclusions an innovative gfff device was designed to achieve the purpose of effective solid liquid separation as well as solid solid separation during the sulfide precipitation process of cswa treatment in order to achieve the best performance of the tank the effects of supersaturation level sulfide to metal molar ratio ph as well as reaction time on the precipitate particle size during the metal sulfide precipitation in a single metal system cu ⅱ zn ⅱ or as ⅲ were investigated the optimum process conditions were identified for the greatest discrepancy in particle sizes of the three metal sulfide precipitate furthermore a cfd model was built to simulate the fluid flow field and precipitate particle movement in the gfff tank under the optimum conditions as well as to evaluate its separation efficiency of fine metal sulfide particles with different particle sizes 1 it was found that the precipitate particle size increases with the decrease of the supersaturation level a high level of supersaturation makes crystal nucleation rather than crystal growth predominant during sulfide precipitation resulting in the generation of fine precipitate particles furthermore under the same mass concentration of cu ⅱ zn ⅱ and as ⅲ cus precipitates has the largest growth rate and particle sizes followed by the as2s3 and zns precipitates 2 when the sulfide to metal molar ratio is smaller or slightly larger than the stoichiometric ratio its influence on the precipitate particle size is not significant nevertheless excessive addition of sulfide ions e g na2s excess coefficient of 2 has a remarkable effect of shrinking the precipitate particle size this may be attributed to the adsorption of s2 on the precipitate particles which suppresses the agglomeration of the particles 3 acid conditions are beneficial to particle size control during metal sulfide precipitation process especially at ph 4 5 when the value of ph is below 4 5 precipitate particle size increases sharply as ph increases for cus and zns precipitate particles but it varies slightly for as2s3 particles 4 it can be concluded that reaction time has a slight effect on the precipitate particle size particularly for zinc and arsenic sulfide precipitates 5 in the simulation the designed gfff tank can effectively separate fine metal sulfide particles from each other based on the difference in their particle sizes under appropriate process conditions 95 cus particles 8 μm could settle to the bottom of the gfff tank which could be further collected from the settlement trough as2s3 particles 5 μm could be separated from zns particles 2 μm owing to their different time intervals flowing out of the tank and the separation efficiencies of as2s3 and zns both are 75 acknowledgement this work was

of 16s ribosomal rna gene sequence was carried out through macrogen south korea the sequence data was aligned using alignment editor ae2 and compared with representative 16s rrna gene sequences of most closely related organisms for sequence analysis basic local alignment search tool blast analysis was performed in national center for biotechnology information ncbi database 25 2 3 prototype water distribution network a schematic of prototype distribution network is shown in fig 1 the system comprises of high density polyethylene hdpe water reservoir with a working volume of 100 l and transmission line made up of 1 inch hdpe piping fittings and valves 26 the transmission line comprises of 10 sampling ports with each port located at an equal distance from adjacent port a high pressure monophasic pump pkm 60 pedrollo italy was used for continuous water flow from reservoir to the transmission line sampling ports labeled 1 5 and 10 were used to collect samples before and after disinfection for real time monitoring ph orp do free chlorine conductivity and temperature total length of the distribution line was kept as 220 m the water in the transmission lines was made to recirculate continuously during the run through the injection port 2 4 generation of ecas ecas was produced by a bridge biotechnology fife scotland esol system 60 l h using water salt and electricity as inputs the system comprises of two major components i e esol generating module coupled with a control module as shown in fig 2 when dc is applied on electrode surface esol generator electro chemical process transforms the electrolyte nacl into an activated metastable state exhibiting elevated chemical reactivity in the anodic chamber continually perfused salt solution reacts at the anode surface producing mainly chlorine species cl2 hclo or clo and oxygen species o3 in addition to reactive oxidants transient in nature h2o2 and oh 2 17 the anodic solution ecas was produced with a high orp ranging between 1100 1200 mv and a ph value between 2 3 and 3 0 ecas generated was subsequently stored under controlled temperature 2 5 preparation of bacterial stocks three isolated bacterial strains analyzed through 16s rrna gene sequencing belonged to aeromonas sp enterobacter sp and e coli genera representative colonies of aeromonas sp from xylose lysine deoxycholate xld medium oxoid ltd hampshire england enterobacter sp from buffered charcoal yeast extract bcye agar oxoid ltd hampshire england and e coli from eosin methylene blue emb agar oxoid ltd hampshire england plates were collected and inoculated in 5 ml nutrient broth oxoid ltd hampshire england these inoculated broth tubes were incubated overnight at 37 c with shaking at 200 rev min the optical density od of bacterial culture after incubation was measured at 600 nm using spectrophotometer to adjust bacterial concentration of desired cfu ml 27 centrifugation of each bacterial culture was done at 6000 rcf using centrifuge k3 series centurion scientific uk for 5 min at 4 c to isolate cells from supernatant and form a pellet at the bottom the supernatant was discarded and pellet was rinsed and resuspended with phosphate buffer ph 7 thrice in order to prevent the addition of non cellular components in the system to minimize disinfectant demand 28 after washing the resultant pellet it was suspended in phosphate buffer to form a suspension 2 6 culture inoculation and treatment freshly prepared stock suspensions of test organisms were inoculated with a mean bacterial count of 1 15 106 cfu ml to the prototype reservoir with 100 l tap water and well mixed to ensure uniform dispersal the control sample was collected immediately after the inoculation of bacterial stock to analyze the change in bacterial growth during the experimental time freshly generated ecas with known properties orp ph and free chlorine was dosed as per desired dosages samples were collected at 10 s 10 min and 1 h in sterile screw caped tubes with 0 01 n quenching agent na2s2o3 to inhibit the residual effect of disinfectant and estimate an accurate count of surviving organisms 26 29 the surviving bacterial population cfu ml of each strain was quantified by plating 0 1 ml portion of respective sample on selective agar plates the colonies of each strain were confirmed by api 20e test kit biomerieux canada 30 experiments were performed in duplicate 3 results and discussions 3 1 properties of ecas table 2 highlights the properties of ecas produced through electrolysis of a saline solution in the esol generating module the orp ph and free chlorine concentration of ecas determines its biocidal potential and kill kinetics the ph conductivity and chloride concentration of ecas disinfected water were slightly raised after respective contact times and were in conformance with the who limits as found by real time monitoring fig 2 3 2 inactivation at 1 ecas dosing microbial consortia comprised of e coli enterobacter sp and aeromonas sp with a mean bacterial count of 1 15 106 cfu ml 6 06 log cfu ml at 1 ecas dosing showed variable extent of disinfection at respective contact times aeromonas sp and e coli exhibited an initial reduction to 4 80 and 4 05 log cfu ml respectively at 10 s exposure time and subsequent increase in bacterial count due to the regrowth recovery aeromonas sp being resistant to disinfection 8 with an ability to recover and regrow 31 has shown least reduction at 10 s followed by regrowth till 1 h exposure time as shown in fig 3 a the trend demonstrates that e coli has shown an overall high recovery potential than aeromonas sp due to its persistent nature 32 and ability to thrive in water rich environment 4 enterobacter sp underwent an overall hike in log reduction throughout the experimental run with maximum of 2 85 at 1 h due to its sensitivity low resistance to disinfectants and unlikely multiplication in water supplies 5 however no significant change in bacterial counts of the control samples were observed a high orp of ecas i e 800 1100 mv in combination with low ph i e 2 5 and free chlorine plays a significant role in killing of microorganisms 15 the bacterial regrowth can also be associated with insufficient disinfectant residual supplemented by assimilable organic carbon content in water 5 the potential oxidizing capacity of the disinfectant at low dosage causes each microorganism to undergo sub lethal injury of varying extent instead of being inactivated 33 these injured cells under suitable conditions recover the cellular damage and outgrow as per their regrowth recovery potential 34 the exposure of bacterial cells to adequate free chlorine one of the antimicrobial components of ecas causes extensive permeabilization of the cytoplasmic membrane and disruption of protein synthesis 16 which results in cellular collapse the high organic matter stabilizes the cytoplasmic membrane against permeabilization which results in inadequate degree of disinfection 28 the adhesion of bacteria on surfaces also affects the degree of disinfection 17 35 at 1 h exposure time the orp and free chlorine of treated water was reduced to 196 mv and 0 mg l respectively corresponding to an initial value of 1119 5 mv and 74 mg l respectively as shown in fig 3 b 3 3 inactivation at 5 ecas dosing ecas has shown prominent antibacterial activity at 5 v v dosage at targeted contact times mean bacterial count of all the test organisms progressively reduced to 3 21 log cfu ml after 1 h exposure time in control sample no significant change in bacterial count was observed fig 4 a shows that the population of enterobacter sp and e coli reduced from 6 11 to 2 72 log cfu ml and from 5 74 to 3 04 log cfu ml respectively this corresponds to a retardation in bacterial activity of 99 for aeromonas sp and e coli whereas 99 9 for enterobacter sp maximum resistance exhibited by aeromonas sp is associated with its strong potential to colonize biofilms 36 and was reduced from 6 34 log cfu ml to 3 87 log cfu ml the varying degree of bacterial kill for each strain enterobacter sp e coli and aeromonas sp is associated with level of stress response to the ecas oxidative stress 37 after 1 h of exposure the highest log reduction of bacterial populations was observed as 3 39 2 70 2 47 for enterobacter sp e coli aeromonas sp respectively fig 4 b indicates that with time the rate of log reduction impedes which may be due to decrease in antimicrobial efficacy as a result of loss of short lived oxidative species of ecas 2 ghebremichael et al 14 determined that freshly generated ecas with ozone concentration of 5 3 decayed to 0 mg l within 30 min influencing the disinfection potential of ecas this orp reduced to 332 mv corresponding to 1 h which corresponds to the concomitant decrease in the oxidative stress 38 39 oxidative stress at higher opr causes a significant reduction in the number of protein bands and hence the cellular protein of bacteria whereas a low orp value causes partial degradation of protein due to weak oxidative stress 40 the substantial decrease in residual chlorine to 0 12 mg l at 1 h contact time is associated with increased chlorine demand of water due to high organic loading 9 the diminishing chlorine from the system indicates conversion to disinfection by products dbps as concluded by gougoutsa et al 41 3 4 inactivation at 10 ecas dosing active microbial consortium of test organisms showed a significant mean log reduction of 3 45 upon adding 10 v v freshly generated ecas at 1 h exposure time suggesting the immediate effect of ecas in retarding the bacterial activity to 99 9 the mean log count of the consortia was reduced from 6 05 to 4 20 log cfu ml fig 5 a reflects that the surviving potential of aeromonas sp was found to be the highest out of the three species with maximum log reduction of 2 74 at exposure time of 1 h this may be associated with the resistant nature and re growth potential of aeromonas sp in even low nutrient environment 8 enterobacter sp turned out to be the least resistant and showed the maximum log reduction of 4 11 whereas e coli showed a maximum log reduction of 3 50 the log reduction trend in fig 5 a demonstrates that each strain has a varying inactivation response analysis reflects an efficient biocidal effect of ecas but none of the test organisms were completely eliminated the findings of ghebremichael et al 14 justifies the trend as inactivation potential of ecas for e coli was found to be 57 lower in tap water than demineralized water warburton et al 32 also quoted that bacterial mortality rate is lower in tap water due to varying chemical composition and carbon content of water the drop in orp value to 336 mv at 1 h denotes deteriorating oxidative stress as shown in fig 5 b this may be associated with the formation of reductants which significantly lowers the orp by donating electrons and hence influencing the log reduction the degradation of transient oxidative functional groups ozone clo2 and hydrogen peroxide of ecas with time also weakens the oxidative stress 2 40 free chorine was found to be 0 2 mg l at 1 h exposure time 4 conclusions the study demonstrates that ecas is a potent biocide with chemically reactive oxidative species inducing modification in molecular ionic structures and rendering the microorganisms ineffective at optimal dosage the analysis shows that fast kill kinetics and residual effect of ecas generated a substantial kill of tap water inoculated test organisms with a mean count of 1 15 106 cfu ml each test organism exhibited an independent response against varying contact times and dosages the inactivation kinetics at respective dosages 1 5 and 10 showed that enterobacter sp and e coli are more vulnerable to ecas than aeromonas sp due to less susceptibility of the latter toward ecas and high resistance in a consortium the overall degree of disinfection was highest at 10 ecas dosage and 1 h contact time where the consortia was reduced from 6 05 to 4 20 log cfu ml resulting in an overall mean log reduction of 3 45 the inactivation trend revealed that oxidizing potential of ecas directly correlates with the orp as with time the stability of oxidative species degrades due to the formation of reductants the efficacy of ecas is also interlinked with the concentration of dissolved organic carbon and other dissolved substances in raw water therefore adequate pretreatment before disinfection could further enhance the biocidal potential of ecas at even lower concentration and contact time acknowledgements this study was supported by scottish governmentfunded project clean water from scotland to

14024,the biocidal efficiency of electrochemically activated solutions ecas against isolated bacterial species from the water distribution network was analyzed predominant microbial consortia identified using 16s rrna gene sequencing as aeromonas sp enterobacter sp and escherichia coli with a mean count of 1 15 106 cfu ml was inoculated in 100 l tap water in a prototype network to simulate real conditions the physico chemical quality of tap water of subsurface origin was assessed before experimentation the contact times of 10 s 10 min and 1 h were selected against the ecas dosages of 1 5 and 10 v v respectively each test organism showed an independent response at varying dosages a 10 disinfectant dosage corresponding to a contact time of 1 h showed the highest log reduction as 4 11 3 50 2 74 for enterobacter sp e coli aeromonas sp respectively the results revealed that due to varying physico chemical composition and carbon content of test water complete inhibition of test organism 1 15 106 cfu ml was not achieved at 10 ecas dosing for 1 h the study concludes that adequate pretreatment could further enhance the removal efficacy and reduce the minimum inhibitory concentration of ecas keywords electrochemically activated solutions ecas aeromonas sp enterobacter sp e coli oxidative potential 1 introduction around 844 million people of the world lack access to safe drinking water sources 1 consumption of unsafe water causes around 1 7 2 million deaths annually from diseases e g diarrhea 2 in developing or underdeveloped countries primarily due to poor sanitary conditions 3 the presence and control of pathogens in drinking water continues to be a high priority especially as some of them are able to proliferate in the distribution networks 4 waterborne outbreaks have been associated with inadequate treatment of water supplies 5 effective elimination of pathogenic microorganisms in the raw water supply through disinfection 6 and the provision of a residual in the distribution network is imperative to alleviate the waterborne outbreaks 7 despite the effectiveness of chlorine as a water disinfectant there are certain disadvantages e g ineffective against resistant microorganisms that produce toxins and colonize biofilms 8 specific residual chlorine concentration required to inactivate each type of microbe 9 formation of disinfection by products of concern such as trihalomethanes thms 10 11 emergence of recalcitrant pathogens 12 and risks associated with the handling and storage of disinfectant 13 which have instigated the revaluation of its use and search of alternative disinfection methods 14 recently electrochemically activated solutions ecas are considered to be more environmentally friendly disinfectant 15 with a higher disinfection potential as compared to chlorine due to the presence of multiple oxidants 7 it is referred to as a nontoxic green biocide and hypoallergenic in nature 15 with no need to transport and store potentially hazardous chemicals 16 ecas is produced by electrolysis of a solution containing sodium chloride nacl or hydrochloric acid hcl resulting in a biocide with a strong oxidation reduction potential orp low ph and high free chlorine 17 ecas has been reported to have a wide range of antimicrobial activity against salmonella listeria monocytogenes escherichia coli o157 h7 hepatitis b virus herpes simplex viruses human norovirus surrogates avian influenza and other pathogens 18 due to its rapid mode of action and fast kill kinetics 19 20 it is found to have beneficial application in drinking water disinfection 2 7 14 ecas is known by various terms most commonly electrolyzed water ew electrochemically activated water ecaw electrolyzed oxidizing water eow electrolyzed solution esol super oxidized water and mixed oxidant miox solutions 15 ecas uses water salt and electricity as inputs for its generation it is produced by applying a direct current dc across the anode and cathode parted by a permeable ion exchange membrane allowing continual perfusion of an electrolyte solution 2 the generated anolyte solution ecas is dosed to the water to be disinfected the anolyte being ecas has a very low ph i e 2 3 2 7 and high oxidation reduction potential orp i e 1000 1200 mv 17 21 ecas is usually composed of multiple oxidizing agents i e chlorine species hydrogen peroxide oxygen species such as ozone and hydroxyl radicals 14 22 it is rapidly degradable and reverts to a weak salt solution during the time of chemical relaxation 19 the propensity of trihalomethanes thms and halo acetic acids haas formation in ecas treated water is 50 less than chlorine based disinfectants naocl due to the presence of chloro oxygen species in it 12 14 high orp generates strong oxidative stress which causes damage to the cell membrane 16 and creates an environment outside the working domain of major microbial processes such as energy generating mechanisms the powerful oxidants sequester electrons from microbial structure compounds with high efficiency which results in rupturing of the biochemical bonds and loss of function subsequently 19 although many studies showed antimicrobial efficacy of ecas either in its pure form or in demineralized water however limited work has been done to analyze the disinfection potential of ecas in tap water therefore the current study investigated the efficacy of ecas in tap water of groundwater origin inoculated with enteric bacteria with a mean count of 1 15 106 cfu ml isolated from water distribution network of the study area employing prototype distribution network 2 materials and methods 2 1 water sampling and analysis the tap water quality significantly impacts treatment efficiency due to the presence of minerals and organic substances environmental and physico chemical factors must be considered during inactivation as they influence the disinfectant efficacy 9 to assess tap water s physico chemical characteristics samples were collected in triplicates before each experimental run and subjected to analysis employing standard methods of examination 23 the samples were stored in sterile screw capped glass sampling bottles prior to sample collection bottles were rinsed with the same collected water samples concerning the reliability and accuracy of analysis ph orp free chlorine and temperature were measured on site orp and ph were measured using multimeter analyzer hi 83141 hanna us with ph electrode hi 1230 hanna us and orp electrode hq 3131b hanna us

human consumption 24 table 1 shows physico chemical analysis for the tap water samples collected before each experimental run the analysis depict that all the parameters were within range and meet the who limits total organic carbon toc load may be associated with the natural organic matter nom in groundwater of study area organic matter being a noticeable parameter of raw and treated water 25 constitutes around 58 organic carbon 26 the organic carbon content in water significantly impacts the antimicrobial potential of ecas 17 19 as microorganism proliferate using assimilable organic
