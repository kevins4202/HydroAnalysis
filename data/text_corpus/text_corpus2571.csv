12855,the prediction of influent characteristics using state of the art mathematical models can help optimize wastewater treatment plants wwtp processes however wwtp operators lack experience with such models and the historical data necessary for their calibration thus mathematical models for inflow prediction are barely used in practice on the other hand the scientific community has recently made great strides in developing predictive modeling approaches for estimating inflow quantity and quality this review paper compares existing models based on the dataset used modeling approach and targeted application due to the significant differences in data resolution used for calibration and variable mathematical approaches it is impossible to define one universally correct modeling approach besides machine learning approaches such as ann hybrid modeling approaches are also capable of good approximations of water and wastewater treatment processes moreover this review evaluated the accuracy and robustness of predictive models used in specific situations to bridge the theory to practice gap existing models need to be connected with real time data transfer graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords data mining influent forecasting influent prediction machine learning wwtp optimization data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction variations in the quality and quantity of wastewater in the inlet to wastewater treatment plants wwtp often reduce treatment efficiency as a result wwtp can discharge effluent with above limit concentrations of cod bod n and p all of which can harm aquatic ecosystems or even threaten sources of freshwater particularly in drought impacted areas 28 the variations in the wwtp inlet can be partially stochastic due to e g precipitation or variable wastewater production 8 thus timely information about inflow characteristics is crucial for optimal wwtp operation inlet wastewater quality can be assessed by offline measurements hardware sensors or recently highlighted model based soft sensors offline measurements such as cod or bod are time consuming therefore they are unsuitable for optimizing treatment processes in real time 12 36 hardware monitoring such as cod probes can provide the required information about wastewater pollution in real time however their investment costs are high and such sensors are not widely applied especially at smaller wwtp 100 000 pe soft sensors based on predictive mathematical models can be a cheaper and adequate replacement for hardware sensors 30 predictive models can also forecast inflow characteristics hours in advance 17 86 87 however selecting an optimal mathematical model for a specific situation to achieve high prediction accuracy is challenging estimating inflow parameters in real time will help adapt wwtp operation e g adjusting chemical doses or aeration intensity or the effective use of retention tanks but even greater benefits will be achieved by prediction 17 87 so far inflow prediction is often based on experience and weather forecasts which is insufficient for sustainable wwtp operation 43 sewage flow is relatively stable during dry periods and can be predicted based on the season day of the week and time of the day flow rate changes originating from intensive precipitation e g heavy rainfall jeopardize the correct prediction of wastewater quantity and quality especially in combined sewer systems 15 46 even though predictive models are commonly used in the industry and water sector 28 39 59 they are yet to find use at wwtp 30 recently various mathematical models for inflow prediction have been developed and even calibrated with full scale historical data e g alsulaili and refaie 2 kang et al 40 vezzaro et al 75 wang et al 78 for instance cod has been predicted in at least nine different ways 2 35 44 47 54 78 80 82 89 however these models were calibrated based on different sampling regimes e g length resolution and dataset quality e g amount of input parameters meteorological conditions errors since every model is calibrated on an original dataset its reliability can be limited to specific situations 36 furthermore the crucial datasets are often sensitive or have a low resolution which hinders the implementation of predictive models in wwtp practice 12 22 77 in past reviews the use of soft sensors on wwtp was introduced by 30 in the review model structure selection was briefly introduced but no practical examples were included 18 described state of the art of mathematical models used for general data transformation at wwtp here the necessity of objectively comparing modeling techniques used for data processing at wwtp was highlighted 36 described data driven models used in soft sensors for effluent prediction in their systematic review mathematical approaches used for prediction were compared according to 36 in addition to further research of mathematical models the input hard sensors still need to be improved to make soft sensors more robust this review aims to critically overview the existing models calibrated on full scale data and show a good practice of predictive model use for soft sensing and inflow forecasting evaluating the existing models can help to decide which model to use determine what data will be needed to calibrate the model and draw attention to possible shortcomings of the model furthermore this review aims to highlight important research gaps first models are often trained on an unsatisfactory data set second the influence of weather which fundamentally affects the quality and quantity of the inflow is most often neglected in these studies last but not least data transfer security is the most sensitive point for wwtp operators and has seen very little discussion in the literature fig 1 shows the framework of the review content 2 data collection techniques before a predictive model is created data collection is required therefore sensing is a crucial part of the prediction and control system in the last decade the monitoring of various parameters and the subsequent prediction and control of wwtp has found wide applications du et al 24 gao et al 26 hameed et al 31 nourani 60 2 1 hardware sensors according to vanrolleghem and lee 73 hardware sensors so called hard sensors are classified into two general groups 1 low maintenance simple reliable sensors used for daily wwtp condition checks and 2 high maintenance sensors used for the real time monitoring of a target variable or model calibration for instance even small wwtp typically below 100 000 population equivalent pe are partially or fully equipped with the basic low maintenance sensors for ph temperature dissolved oxygen and oxidation reduction potential 90 these parameters correlate with so called primary variables nitrogen species phosphorus cod or bod whose direct sensing is expensive and requires intense maintenance 30 therefore such a correlation can estimate the primary variables using computational power in so called soft sensors 39 see section 2 2 high maintenance hardware sensors are used for real time monitoring of the dynamic wastewater treatment process auditing the calibration of mathematical models and optimization of wwtp operation 73 the use of hard sensors for data collection significantly exceeds occasional laboratory measurements when a forecast of the wwtp influent is required hardware measurement provides data with high resolution for model calibration and evaluating forecast accuracy there is no doubt about the great potential of hardware sensors however the instruments tend to get fouled or damaged upon long time exposure to wastewater leading to poor sensor performance 62 even though novel sensors may have self cleaning equipment shutdowns during maintenance or recalibration are also required 29 therefore high maintenance hard sensors can be optimized by combining them with soft sensors and advanced computation methods 29 also the level of hard sensor equipment at a wwtp usually goes hand in hand with the treatment capacity of the wwtp and with the investment opportunity the smaller the wwtp the smaller the investment opportunities this fact also points out the need to develop more affordable soft sensors well designed data collection is a key to reliable dataset generation and thus more accurate model calibration 12 2 2 soft sensors soft sensors predict hard to measure primary variables output according to easy to measure secondary variables input 39 the relationship between input and output variables is described by a mechanistic or data driven mathematical model 30 soft sensors based on mechanistic models are mainly used to design wwtp and determine the ideal steady state recently data driven soft sensors have become much more popular since they can process data collected in real time 65 non linear relationships for cod bod tss and nutrient concentration prediction can be found and described 30 the advantage of data driven soft sensors is that many techniques e g artificial neural networks neuro fuzzy systems support vector machines or principal component analysis can be used and the model can be optimized for a specific situation thus they provide practical information about the actual state of the system which makes them popular in the industry 39 the most critical measured primary variables are usually the concentrations of total nitrogen tn nitrite and nitrate total phosphorus tss cod bod and sludge blanket level 25 73 secondary variables correlate with primary variables and are commonly measured at wwtp pressure temperature flow rate conductivity ph and dissolved oxygen 30 as for inflow characteristics cod and flow rate predominate in the literature table 2 it is necessary to note that even if the accuracy of the developed predictive model can be very high it is still only an estimation to determine the correlation between modeled and real data calibration with hard sensors is required including collecting a large amount of data with high temporal resolution according to bhuyan 10 haimi et al 29 when online hardware measurement is available and economically feasible it will always be prioritized over soft sensing and estimation should be used as a backup this mindset can be overcome today since i the short service life and ii the need for regular maintenance repairs of hard sensors can lead to the use of almost maintenance free soft sensors soft sensors can significantly help sustainably operate small scale wwtp in a financially acceptable manner 49 3 influent forecasting influent forecasting provides information about the future situation and can help to prepare wwtp for upcoming situations e g a critical increase in flow rate in advance 17 borzooei et al 16 confirmed the premises and provided further elaboration on having long term data for mathematical modeling improvement the difference between soft sensing and the forecasting of influent characteristics is in the time difference of the received information soft sensing immediate forecasting future for precise confirmation of the mathematical model robustness information about the type of sewer system has to be clarified forecasting inflow from a combined sewer system crucially requires rainfall data 50 for example kim et al 44 calibrated a forecasting model without assuming rainfall data and the seven day prediction of wet days worsened ideally rainfall data should be obtained from both historical records as well as real time from gauge stations weather radar or weather forecasts 50 the specific rainfall data type required crucially depends on the size of the catchment area in small catchment areas the time for precipitation inflow to the wwtp is very short and thus limits the forecast time therefore the weather forecast is more suitable for smaller wwtp even if the accuracy of the weather forecast then limits the accuracy of the inflow forecast zhou et al 86 successfully used historical data about the inflow quantity and various weather parameters to calibrate and test a random forest model for the prediction of inflow changes at a large humber wwtp ontario canada as a result almost 94 of samples fell into their corresponding predicted interval moreover zhou et al 86 took date and time as categorical variables i e hour day and season were used as weighting factors in the prediction this approach was not specified in other studies 74 81 82 but when the database is available these categorical variables are important for increasing prediction accuracy besides rainfall seasonal changes cannot be left out when modeling catchment areas with winter and summer differences the water is usually more polluted in winter but the flow rate is lower in summer the situation is the opposite 78 avoiding these factors is one of the limitations of some studies 5 many studies present models that are only trained on historical quality parameters and flow rate 17 21 47 54 which makes the prediction less precise and the robustness of the model is reduced the model would not be able to precisely forecast unusual situations related to weather factors which are crucial for wwtp operational changes and wwtp protection 78 on the other hand the above studies 17 21 47 54 did not clarify whether the sewer systems were combined or separate therefore the robustness of the models used cannot be confirmed with certainty the forecasting horizon of a given model is strongly dependent on meteorological conditions ansari et al 5 tested four models for inflow rate forecasting with a time horizon of 44 weeks ahead such long forecasting is misleading since the meteorological conditions are omitted in kusiak et al 47 carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand cbod was forecasted with a maximum time horizon of 5 days wei and hosseini 81 used rainfall rate data for model calibration and forecasted flow rate with a time horizon of up to 180 min compared to kusiak et al 47 the accuracy of the same model was higher r 99 and the forecasted time horizon of 180 min was sufficient for wwtp preparation and operational changes forecasting the quality and quantity of wwtp influents might be a pivotal step in improving energy and cost management in response to load changes 47 for instance continuous aeration in the nitrification part of the aeration tank leads to useless energy loss during off peak periods it can increase the total nitrogen discharge due to nitrate production instead of denitrification on the other hand underestimating the aeration can increase the ammonia discharge especially during a rain event 50 for instance when the capacity of a wwtp is underestimated the chemicals and operational parameters used to maintain support treatment efficiency i e coagulants dosing or internal recirculation enhancement can be calculated and dosed or set accurately according to the organic loading predicted last but not least according to the inflow to the wwtp the number of running raw wastewater pumps can be scheduled to maintain the required water level in the pumping station and reduce the use of electricity during off peak periods 82 4 mathematical models used for influent prediction and forecasting 4 1 data driven models data driven so called non mechanistic or black box models are based on large sets of data big data the models aim to find the relationship between state variables and control variables i e input and output with no additional knowledge about the internals of the processes 18 66 these models are mainly used to predict selected parameters detect unusual and fault situations and develop soft sensors 52 although such modeling seems less popular than mechanistic due to the lack of a deeper insight into the process data driven models can be more accurate than mechanistic for inflow prediction 27 moreover the connection of a data driven control strategy with artificial intelligence capable of self learning can detect malfunctioning of the treatment process or sensor and can thus timely detect impending equipment failure and choose a backup process strategy 27 41 76 comparing mathematical models is challenging and a comparison based only on the published literature can be irrelevant due to the differences in input data and their differing resolutions therefore when choosing a predictive model data fluctuations correlations and the amount of data must be considered 78 in the literature linear and non linear time series models are used 4 1 1 linear models 4 1 1 1 auto regressive integrated moving average the well studied linear model arima auto regressive integrated moving average is an autoregressive moving average arma model arima was studied mainly for flow rate prediction 5 17 85 in all studies historical flow rate data with various sampling frequencies were used while accuracy was expressed by the correlation coefficient and the coefficient of determination table 2 maleki et al 53 used arima to predict total alkalinity ph total ca co2 chloride temperature total hardness turbidity total dissolved solids and electrical conductivity the highest and lowest accuracy were achieved for alkalinity r2 0 85 and chloride r2 0 44 arima only has good inflow prediction potential when the data provided for calibration are stationary 42 85 4 1 1 2 linear regression linear regression models have similar difficulties to arima wang et al 78 tested four linear regression models linear regression ridge regression elasticnet regression and lasso regression to predict flow rate cod and ammonia the accuracy of all the models 86 82 and 74 for flow rate cod and ammonia resp was not sufficient for wwtp operators therefore non linear models are preferred when non stationary data sets are available 4 1 2 non linear models 4 1 2 1 artificial neural networks the most popular non linear models for influent characteristics prediction are based on various types of artificial neural networks ann the robustness of the ann strongly depends on the type of ann and the quality of the training dataset the use of daily influent data can lead to a high prediction accuracy e g aminabad et al 3 kang et al 40 but the daily inflow is not a valuable parameter for operating the wwtp data with a smaller sampling time step should be used to describe the trends in daily inflow fluctuations accurately since ann relies on high quality historical data ann can be considered unsuitable with a poor dataset on the other hand ann requires a relatively small amount of data 56 therefore instead of using several years of daily data an intensive sampling campaign can suffice to prepare a quality dataset another drawback of ann is the missing procedure to determine the ann s structure such as the number of hidden layers or neurons which is usually chosen subjectively 44 56 72 78 83 despite all these drawbacks ann appears to be a suitable tool for predicting inflow characteristics 4 1 2 2 random forest recently the random forest rf method was tested for flow rate prediction and compared with arima and multilayer perceptron neural networks mlp 86 rf can assign weight to individual parameters potentially increasing the model s accuracy rf has demonstrated its potential in other fields e g dai et al 20 37 57 58 zahedi et al 84 compared to arima and mlp rf was a competitive tool rf was less accurate during peak periods which may be due to the random selection of a training set that did not cover a sufficient number of peak learning periods this can be achieved by training the rf separately for dry and wet periods 86 4 1 2 3 k nearest neighbor another studied non linear modeling approach is the k nearest neighbor method here the prediction is based on looking for similar pairs of data located in the past then the weight is assigned to the selected pair classified as the nearest neighbors the strict dependence on past data makes the k nearest neighbor weak for a situation that has not been mapped in the past 72 therefore a longer sampling period is required to minimize the chance of unpredictable situations especially in combined sewer systems on the other hand as the size of the problem increases the computational expense grows 63 86 kim et al 44 achieved rmse 5 82 for cod in wet conditions using a dataset based on three years of daily inflow characteristics sampling 4 1 2 4 multivariate adaptive regression splines the multivariate adaptive regression splines mars model was used for cod and total phosphorus prediction in norway 79 mars can describe both the linearity and non linearity of the data and can indicate points with significant change 79 wang et al 79 used only six days of hourly samples during cold and warm seasons for model calibration the model s accuracy was r2 0 892 0 889 for cod and total phosphorus respectively however the warm season did not cover any rain events so validation of the mars model is required to confirm its robustness the ability of mars for bod prediction was shown by baki et al 6 mars was compared with the classical regression analysis artificial bee colony and teaching learning algorithm from the tested algorithm mars gave the best results r2 0 9 and 0 8 for training and testing from the tested algorithms mars was able to predict peak periods which is a well known advantage of mars on the other hand mars tends to overfit leading to lower model accuracy 4 2 hybrid models hybrid models so called grey box models were developed to overcome the drawbacks of purely mechanistic and data driven models first it is often challenging to design a mechanistic model of a complex system due to the lack of deeper understanding e g of different biological or chemical processes even though a complex mechanistic model can be theoretically designed its complexity may prevent its practical use as a control tool due to the excessive requirements for computational power 4 secondly data driven models are dependent on the existence of large datasets when the dataset is insufficient prior knowledge can help to cover data sparsity for instance prior knowledge about the behavior of variables in approaching the asymptote can be used to enrich a data driven model 71 combining the models has become popular across the world and many research groups have focused on developing such models 4 19 33 48 64 the term hybrid models also refers to the combination of two or more data driven models combining the advantages of multiple models provides more comprehensive information about historical data and can increase the model s accuracy 80 for instance man et al 54 developed hybrid artificial intelligence algorithms for cod and inflow prediction arma and vector auto regression var algorithms were used for inflow rate and cod forecasting as was mentioned above arma models are suitable for flow rate prediction due to the stationarity of historical data conversely several variables affect cod concentration and therefore var was used for its prediction this combination appeared to be strong and the forecasting accuracy was up to 99 hybrid models can help address specific problems leading to more accurate prediction forecasting 89 wang et al 80 combined two types of ann convolutional neural network cnn and long short term memory lstm in a cnn lstm model for cod flow and cod mass flow prediction when the cod and flow were predicted separately and cod mass flow was then calculated from predicted parameters the results were worse maximum relative error 5 13 than using direct prediction for cod mass flow maximum relative error 2 11 since the error allowed for aeration control is 5 separate cod and flow prediction with subsequent calculation of cod mass flow is not suitable in industry 80 compared to the use of a single cnn and lstm the cnn lstm hybrid model provides better stability with significantly fluctuating data it can also remember more extended sequences 7 which can be helpful while processing a long period of sampled data the required longer training time is compensated for with less training epochs required and higher model accuracy 7 the main characteristics determining the use of selected models are summarized in table 1 an overview of publications dealing with inflow prediction at full scale wwtp is summarized in table 2 5 limitations of the existing research when comparing studies published in the field of predictive models of wastewater quality one has to consider serious biases given to the inconsistent quality of these studies this section describes the important and most frequent of these issues 5 1 models applicability and challenges existing models use datasets of various quality table 2 the calibration of the model on weekly or daily data only leads to probable lower accuracy during daily fluctuations therefore the use of daily data for calibration is not suitable for using the developed model for short term event predictions that are crucial for managing the treatment plant thus although a model may exhibit high accuracy on daily or weekly data it does not necessarily mean that the model will eventually be implemented in practice unless its accuracy is verified on another dataset the lack of model validation is one of the limitations in the literature based on the literature review the accurate purpose formulation for the predictive model implementation is missing in many studies or is vaguely explained the most frequently referred purpose is to save energy and operational costs however the exact approach is missing the most frequently reported approach is the optimization of aeration and chemical dosing which is based on daily fluctuations these fluctuations are ignored in studies where daily or weekly inflow characteristics prediction is applied table 2 if the approach for operational savings is first clearly defined the direction of modeling and the need for specific data inputs can be positively affected i e which parameters are to be measured with what frequency resulting in the reduced expenses for the sampling equipment and workforce another drawback is a significant difference in providing information about the tested area in the studies the model s accuracy and practicality can be evaluated only when complete information about the data and locality is provided for instance calibration of the mathematical models based on historical quality and quantity parameters and omitting the weather aspects leads to the unreliability of the models in unexpected situations 78 on the other hand when the sewer network is separated from the rainwater the model can be valid the information about the sewer system is crucial for evaluating the model s accuracy and practicality in the reviewed literature most studies tested one mathematical model to discuss its suitability for inflow characteristics predictions and suggest improvements for further research only a few researchers 5 78 86 87 focused on comparing several mathematical approaches to find the best algorithm for the specific case study these studies significantly impact the possible implementation of predictive models in practice since the pros and cons for specific situations are described developing a mathematical model to predict effluent parameters is another way to use the measured data at the inflow rate nourani et al 61 used three different ai non linear methods feed forward neural network ffnn adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis support vector machines svm and a classical multi linear regression mlr to predict cod bod and total nitrogen tn in the effluent of nicosia cyprus wwtp one year of daily measured data in the influent and effluent was used as an input ph conductivity bod cod and total nitrogen and target bod cod tn of the model anfis 5 1 five inputs and one output neuron had the best effluent predictive ability with determination coefficients for bod cod and tn of 0 74 0 94 and 0 96 respectively this study improved the usability of non linear models for multiple parameters with a good fit using data from the predicted or forecasted inflow parameters instead of physically measured data on site is another challenge for research in the field of wwtp optimization 5 2 data accessibility and real time transfer wastewater treatment plants are still far behind in the digital transition compared to other industries 77 most of the published studies rely solely on historical data when the developed model is used at full scale real time data transfer from sensors to the model must be ensured due to the high sensitivity of the data finding the best means for such transfer can be the most crucial part of the prediction application the use of cyber safe cloud systems is a common practice in other fields therefore there is great potential for implementing these in the water industry in addition to developing a suitable algorithm very few studies deal with subsequent implementation in practice vezzaro et al 75 focused on predicting ammonia concentration in the influent of wwtp in damhusaaen and viby denmark both wwtp were equipped with an ion selective sensor for ammonia concentration measurement and the obtained data were sent to the cloud based system aquavista for automatic control the model s accuracy was only 75 caused by insufficient weather prediction dry and wet season classification only improper calibration of the ion selective sensor and only a short period of sensor operation it was shown that it is possible to ensure safe data transfer which is usually the most critical part for operators and the reason for the lack of willingness to use such tools a comprehensive project on wwtp digitalization was recently published by wallin and nordlander 77 a complete transformation of wwtp into the digital environment including wwtp model development historical data extraction new online measured data extraction the connection of the model to the data storage output description and result storage was introduced this study showed a good practice of safe data transition and processing at wwtp leading to better process control similar studies are required to bridge the theory to practice gap in the conservative wastewater processing field 5 3 uncertainty quantification one of the aspects potentially limiting the application of data driven models in wwtp practice is the lack of a methodological approach for uncertainty quantification 28 38 uncertainty represents the reliability and efficacy of a data driven mathematical model before the model is used 1 as in natural aquatic streams 59 the inflow parameters can be affected by uncertain parameters such as the weather forecast the uncertainty of wwtp models is usually quantified by monte carlo simulation 9 11 12 55 67 68 uncertain quantification was not discussed in the reviewed research for inflow prediction and forecasting 6 advanced control strategies good practice the application of data driven models may not only serve for predicting and subsequent sustainable wwtp performance but can also significantly decrease wwtp operational costs this section will focus on full scale examples of good practices using model predictive control for better wwtp performance and smart solutions to reduce electricity and other operational costs using the existing sensing infrastructure wwtp transfer to the digital environment allows testing of various event scenarios without the treatment process intervention simulating the operational strategies to achieve energy and cost savings is possible borzooei et al 13 developed a digital simulation of the most prominent italian wwtp the wwtp was simulated using activated sludge model no 1 32 this study aimed to find the main trade off between energy savings and nutrient discharges by finding the optimum solids retention time as the main control parameter of the wwtp keeping the solids retention time within an optimal range was then ensured by the pi controller and waste activated sludge flow rate manipulation scenario analyses showed that a change in operating parameters can lead to a reduction in annual electricity consumption by 5000 mwh moreover the effluent quality index was reduced by 8 10 the same wwtp weather based influent scenarios were tested for aeration strategy improvement 14 incorporating this wwtp management strategy can potentially save 4 1 6 8 of the energy consumed for aeration in drewnowski 23 an innovative control unit previsys zapsoft ltd with data transferred from scada supervisory control and data acquisition and mpc model predictive control was used as an advanced supervisory control system for biological nutrient removal at a full scale wwtp the wastewater process modeling software west dhi denmark was used to conduct different operation strategies this study aimed to reduce electricity needs by optimizing the aeration system since the aeration system consumes 45 75 of the required electric power 51 the optimization of tested wwtp energy consumption was based on improving the aeration and internal recirculation control moreover the online data driven measurement of do no3 and nh4 using mathematical modeling and simulation was used to check the data uncertainty and develop a support operator system the energy consumption was significantly reduced 16 using the double checking data system with further optimization of the introduced control system achieving an even higher reduction in electricity usage should be possible stentoft et al 69 proposed a novel strategy for cost savings and intelligent use of more green energy e g wind turbines by default aeration control is based on the online measurement of ammonium and nitrate rule based control strategy the paper proposed a novel model predictive control mpc driven by stochastic differential equations genetic optimization was proposed to prioritize aeration during cheap energy periods resulting in reduced operational costs the model was calibrated with data from the wwtp at nørre snede 4500 pe the results showed that the rule based control strategy was approx 20 more expensive despite the results being based only on dry periods the mpc introduced is a move to integrate innovative power solutions into wwtp the idea of wastewater treatment during the cheap energy period was expanded in stentoft et al 70 and the applicability was further explained a novel attitude for connecting smart grid electricity with wwtp was introduced by stentoft et al 70 and demonstrated on the kolding denmark wwtp as in stentoft et al 69 and stentoft et al 70 the costs for aeration units decreased in stentoft et al 70 the sewer capacity was used to store wastewater during the dry periods forward knowledge of the inflow made it possible to calculate the free capacity of the sewer system thus wastewater could be retained in the sewer and pumped to the wwtp during a cheap energy period this model predictive control reacts to the 24 h pollution loads forecast and electricity prices a rainfall prediction by numerical weather prediction is included in the mpc the mpc switches back to a rule based control strategy to avoid sewer overflow when rain is predicted the 7 day trial period showed that the monetary savings were quantified to 200 dkk per day when fully exploiting the allowed storage capacity although such a monetary value is negligible compared to other treatment plant expenses the study pointed to the practical use of predictive model control the presented applications show how advanced control strategies might be used of course this potential cannot always be widely transferable for instance if both rainwater and municipal wastewater are present in the sewage system their retention in the sewage system will be problematic or impossible on the other hand a potential use can be adapted to the capabilities of individual applications advanced control strategies involve developing and using software for process modeling simulations in specific systems and energy and cost balance calculations 7 conclusions research into predictive models for inflow characteristics prediction and forecasting has risen recently this article analyzed current research on the use of prediction and inflow forecasts for a wastewater treatment plant we aimed to find the research trends evaluate the suitability of developed models and propose the optimization of further research in order to accelerate the transition from theory to practice most of the reviewed studies investigate the use of neural networks however other models have shown comparable or better results i e k nearest neighbor random forest or multivariate adaptive regression splines for the joint prediction of qualitative and quantitative parameters the development of so called hybrid models can play an important role in practice they have demonstrated a high degree of adaptability and higher accuracy than a single modeling method it is impossible to identify one universally best approach from the reviewed literature as the manuscripts differ significantly in the quality and quantity of data used the nature of the historical data and the predicted characteristic also have a major influence on the selection of a suitable tool and have to be considered when choosing the optimal model a majority of the studies deal with the usability of one specific model to predict a given parameter only a few studies deal with finding the best possible algorithm for a given subject moreover most studies end up calibrating the model using historical data for using predictive models in practice it is necessary to go one step further and ensure the connection of online measured data using hardware sensors with the developed model and ensure the security of this data this topic is discussed very little in the literature predictive models can optimize the treatment plant s management and lead to their more advanced use for saving energy and costs at a wwtp for instance smart grid electricity was introduced in the literature the use of sewer system capacity for wastewater storage in a high energy tariff period can help to decrease treatment costs declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

12855,the prediction of influent characteristics using state of the art mathematical models can help optimize wastewater treatment plants wwtp processes however wwtp operators lack experience with such models and the historical data necessary for their calibration thus mathematical models for inflow prediction are barely used in practice on the other hand the scientific community has recently made great strides in developing predictive modeling approaches for estimating inflow quantity and quality this review paper compares existing models based on the dataset used modeling approach and targeted application due to the significant differences in data resolution used for calibration and variable mathematical approaches it is impossible to define one universally correct modeling approach besides machine learning approaches such as ann hybrid modeling approaches are also capable of good approximations of water and wastewater treatment processes moreover this review evaluated the accuracy and robustness of predictive models used in specific situations to bridge the theory to practice gap existing models need to be connected with real time data transfer graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords data mining influent forecasting influent prediction machine learning wwtp optimization data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction variations in the quality and quantity of wastewater in the inlet to wastewater treatment plants wwtp often reduce treatment efficiency as a result wwtp can discharge effluent with above limit concentrations of cod bod n and p all of which can harm aquatic ecosystems or even threaten sources of freshwater particularly in drought impacted areas 28 the variations in the wwtp inlet can be partially stochastic due to e g precipitation or variable wastewater production 8 thus timely information about inflow characteristics is crucial for optimal wwtp operation inlet wastewater quality can be assessed by offline measurements hardware sensors or recently highlighted model based soft sensors offline measurements such as cod or bod are time consuming therefore they are unsuitable for optimizing treatment processes in real time 12 36 hardware monitoring such as cod probes can provide the required information about wastewater pollution in real time however their investment costs are high and such sensors are not widely applied especially at smaller wwtp 100 000 pe soft sensors based on predictive mathematical models can be a cheaper and adequate replacement for hardware sensors 30 predictive models can also forecast inflow characteristics hours in advance 17 86 87 however selecting an optimal mathematical model for a specific situation to achieve high prediction accuracy is challenging estimating inflow parameters in real time will help adapt wwtp operation e g adjusting chemical doses or aeration intensity or the effective use of retention tanks but even greater benefits will be achieved by prediction 17 87 so far inflow prediction is often based on experience and weather forecasts which is insufficient for sustainable wwtp operation 43 sewage flow is relatively stable during dry periods and can be predicted based on the season day of the week and time of the day flow rate changes originating from intensive precipitation e g heavy rainfall jeopardize the correct prediction of wastewater quantity and quality especially in combined sewer systems 15 46 even though predictive models are commonly used in the industry and water sector 28 39 59 they are yet to find use at wwtp 30 recently various mathematical models for inflow prediction have been developed and even calibrated with full scale historical data e g alsulaili and refaie 2 kang et al 40 vezzaro et al 75 wang et al 78 for instance cod has been predicted in at least nine different ways 2 35 44 47 54 78 80 82 89 however these models were calibrated based on different sampling regimes e g length resolution and dataset quality e g amount of input parameters meteorological conditions errors since every model is calibrated on an original dataset its reliability can be limited to specific situations 36 furthermore the crucial datasets are often sensitive or have a low resolution which hinders the implementation of predictive models in wwtp practice 12 22 77 in past reviews the use of soft sensors on wwtp was introduced by 30 in the review model structure selection was briefly introduced but no practical examples were included 18 described state of the art of mathematical models used for general data transformation at wwtp here the necessity of objectively comparing modeling techniques used for data processing at wwtp was highlighted 36 described data driven models used in soft sensors for effluent prediction in their systematic review mathematical approaches used for prediction were compared according to 36 in addition to further research of mathematical models the input hard sensors still need to be improved to make soft sensors more robust this review aims to critically overview the existing models calibrated on full scale data and show a good practice of predictive model use for soft sensing and inflow forecasting evaluating the existing models can help to decide which model to use determine what data will be needed to calibrate the model and draw attention to possible shortcomings of the model furthermore this review aims to highlight important research gaps first models are often trained on an unsatisfactory data set second the influence of weather which fundamentally affects the quality and quantity of the inflow is most often neglected in these studies last but not least data transfer security is the most sensitive point for wwtp operators and has seen very little discussion in the literature fig 1 shows the framework of the review content 2 data collection techniques before a predictive model is created data collection is required therefore sensing is a crucial part of the prediction and control system in the last decade the monitoring of various parameters and the subsequent prediction and control of wwtp has found wide applications du et al 24 gao et al 26 hameed et al 31 nourani 60 2 1 hardware sensors according to vanrolleghem and lee 73 hardware sensors so called hard sensors are classified into two general groups 1 low maintenance simple reliable sensors used for daily wwtp condition checks and 2 high maintenance sensors used for the real time monitoring of a target variable or model calibration for instance even small wwtp typically below 100 000 population equivalent pe are partially or fully equipped with the basic low maintenance sensors for ph temperature dissolved oxygen and oxidation reduction potential 90 these parameters correlate with so called primary variables nitrogen species phosphorus cod or bod whose direct sensing is expensive and requires intense maintenance 30 therefore such a correlation can estimate the primary variables using computational power in so called soft sensors 39 see section 2 2 high maintenance hardware sensors are used for real time monitoring of the dynamic wastewater treatment process auditing the calibration of mathematical models and optimization of wwtp operation 73 the use of hard sensors for data collection significantly exceeds occasional laboratory measurements when a forecast of the wwtp influent is required hardware measurement provides data with high resolution for model calibration and evaluating forecast accuracy there is no doubt about the great potential of hardware sensors however the instruments tend to get fouled or damaged upon long time exposure to wastewater leading to poor sensor performance 62 even though novel sensors may have self cleaning equipment shutdowns during maintenance or recalibration are also required 29 therefore high maintenance hard sensors can be optimized by combining them with soft sensors and advanced computation methods 29 also the level of hard sensor equipment at a wwtp usually goes hand in hand with the treatment capacity of the wwtp and with the investment opportunity the smaller the wwtp the smaller the investment opportunities this fact also points out the need to develop more affordable soft sensors well designed data collection is a key to reliable dataset generation and thus more accurate model calibration 12 2 2 soft sensors soft sensors predict hard to measure primary variables output according to easy to measure secondary variables input 39 the relationship between input and output variables is described by a mechanistic or data driven mathematical model 30 soft sensors based on mechanistic models are mainly used to design wwtp and determine the ideal steady state recently data driven soft sensors have become much more popular since they can process data collected in real time 65 non linear relationships for cod bod tss and nutrient concentration prediction can be found and described 30 the advantage of data driven soft sensors is that many techniques e g artificial neural networks neuro fuzzy systems support vector machines or principal component analysis can be used and the model can be optimized for a specific situation thus they provide practical information about the actual state of the system which makes them popular in the industry 39 the most critical measured primary variables are usually the concentrations of total nitrogen tn nitrite and nitrate total phosphorus tss cod bod and sludge blanket level 25 73 secondary variables correlate with primary variables and are commonly measured at wwtp pressure temperature flow rate conductivity ph and dissolved oxygen 30 as for inflow characteristics cod and flow rate predominate in the literature table 2 it is necessary to note that even if the accuracy of the developed predictive model can be very high it is still only an estimation to determine the correlation between modeled and real data calibration with hard sensors is required including collecting a large amount of data with high temporal resolution according to bhuyan 10 haimi et al 29 when online hardware measurement is available and economically feasible it will always be prioritized over soft sensing and estimation should be used as a backup this mindset can be overcome today since i the short service life and ii the need for regular maintenance repairs of hard sensors can lead to the use of almost maintenance free soft sensors soft sensors can significantly help sustainably operate small scale wwtp in a financially acceptable manner 49 3 influent forecasting influent forecasting provides information about the future situation and can help to prepare wwtp for upcoming situations e g a critical increase in flow rate in advance 17 borzooei et al 16 confirmed the premises and provided further elaboration on having long term data for mathematical modeling improvement the difference between soft sensing and the forecasting of influent characteristics is in the time difference of the received information soft sensing immediate forecasting future for precise confirmation of the mathematical model robustness information about the type of sewer system has to be clarified forecasting inflow from a combined sewer system crucially requires rainfall data 50 for example kim et al 44 calibrated a forecasting model without assuming rainfall data and the seven day prediction of wet days worsened ideally rainfall data should be obtained from both historical records as well as real time from gauge stations weather radar or weather forecasts 50 the specific rainfall data type required crucially depends on the size of the catchment area in small catchment areas the time for precipitation inflow to the wwtp is very short and thus limits the forecast time therefore the weather forecast is more suitable for smaller wwtp even if the accuracy of the weather forecast then limits the accuracy of the inflow forecast zhou et al 86 successfully used historical data about the inflow quantity and various weather parameters to calibrate and test a random forest model for the prediction of inflow changes at a large humber wwtp ontario canada as a result almost 94 of samples fell into their corresponding predicted interval moreover zhou et al 86 took date and time as categorical variables i e hour day and season were used as weighting factors in the prediction this approach was not specified in other studies 74 81 82 but when the database is available these categorical variables are important for increasing prediction accuracy besides rainfall seasonal changes cannot be left out when modeling catchment areas with winter and summer differences the water is usually more polluted in winter but the flow rate is lower in summer the situation is the opposite 78 avoiding these factors is one of the limitations of some studies 5 many studies present models that are only trained on historical quality parameters and flow rate 17 21 47 54 which makes the prediction less precise and the robustness of the model is reduced the model would not be able to precisely forecast unusual situations related to weather factors which are crucial for wwtp operational changes and wwtp protection 78 on the other hand the above studies 17 21 47 54 did not clarify whether the sewer systems were combined or separate therefore the robustness of the models used cannot be confirmed with certainty the forecasting horizon of a given model is strongly dependent on meteorological conditions ansari et al 5 tested four models for inflow rate forecasting with a time horizon of 44 weeks ahead such long forecasting is misleading since the meteorological conditions are omitted in kusiak et al 47 carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand cbod was forecasted with a maximum time horizon of 5 days wei and hosseini 81 used rainfall rate data for model calibration and forecasted flow rate with a time horizon of up to 180 min compared to kusiak et al 47 the accuracy of the same model was higher r 99 and the forecasted time horizon of 180 min was sufficient for wwtp preparation and operational changes forecasting the quality and quantity of wwtp influents might be a pivotal step in improving energy and cost management in response to load changes 47 for instance continuous aeration in the nitrification part of the aeration tank leads to useless energy loss during off peak periods it can increase the total nitrogen discharge due to nitrate production instead of denitrification on the other hand underestimating the aeration can increase the ammonia discharge especially during a rain event 50 for instance when the capacity of a wwtp is underestimated the chemicals and operational parameters used to maintain support treatment efficiency i e coagulants dosing or internal recirculation enhancement can be calculated and dosed or set accurately according to the organic loading predicted last but not least according to the inflow to the wwtp the number of running raw wastewater pumps can be scheduled to maintain the required water level in the pumping station and reduce the use of electricity during off peak periods 82 4 mathematical models used for influent prediction and forecasting 4 1 data driven models data driven so called non mechanistic or black box models are based on large sets of data big data the models aim to find the relationship between state variables and control variables i e input and output with no additional knowledge about the internals of the processes 18 66 these models are mainly used to predict selected parameters detect unusual and fault situations and develop soft sensors 52 although such modeling seems less popular than mechanistic due to the lack of a deeper insight into the process data driven models can be more accurate than mechanistic for inflow prediction 27 moreover the connection of a data driven control strategy with artificial intelligence capable of self learning can detect malfunctioning of the treatment process or sensor and can thus timely detect impending equipment failure and choose a backup process strategy 27 41 76 comparing mathematical models is challenging and a comparison based only on the published literature can be irrelevant due to the differences in input data and their differing resolutions therefore when choosing a predictive model data fluctuations correlations and the amount of data must be considered 78 in the literature linear and non linear time series models are used 4 1 1 linear models 4 1 1 1 auto regressive integrated moving average the well studied linear model arima auto regressive integrated moving average is an autoregressive moving average arma model arima was studied mainly for flow rate prediction 5 17 85 in all studies historical flow rate data with various sampling frequencies were used while accuracy was expressed by the correlation coefficient and the coefficient of determination table 2 maleki et al 53 used arima to predict total alkalinity ph total ca co2 chloride temperature total hardness turbidity total dissolved solids and electrical conductivity the highest and lowest accuracy were achieved for alkalinity r2 0 85 and chloride r2 0 44 arima only has good inflow prediction potential when the data provided for calibration are stationary 42 85 4 1 1 2 linear regression linear regression models have similar difficulties to arima wang et al 78 tested four linear regression models linear regression ridge regression elasticnet regression and lasso regression to predict flow rate cod and ammonia the accuracy of all the models 86 82 and 74 for flow rate cod and ammonia resp was not sufficient for wwtp operators therefore non linear models are preferred when non stationary data sets are available 4 1 2 non linear models 4 1 2 1 artificial neural networks the most popular non linear models for influent characteristics prediction are based on various types of artificial neural networks ann the robustness of the ann strongly depends on the type of ann and the quality of the training dataset the use of daily influent data can lead to a high prediction accuracy e g aminabad et al 3 kang et al 40 but the daily inflow is not a valuable parameter for operating the wwtp data with a smaller sampling time step should be used to describe the trends in daily inflow fluctuations accurately since ann relies on high quality historical data ann can be considered unsuitable with a poor dataset on the other hand ann requires a relatively small amount of data 56 therefore instead of using several years of daily data an intensive sampling campaign can suffice to prepare a quality dataset another drawback of ann is the missing procedure to determine the ann s structure such as the number of hidden layers or neurons which is usually chosen subjectively 44 56 72 78 83 despite all these drawbacks ann appears to be a suitable tool for predicting inflow characteristics 4 1 2 2 random forest recently the random forest rf method was tested for flow rate prediction and compared with arima and multilayer perceptron neural networks mlp 86 rf can assign weight to individual parameters potentially increasing the model s accuracy rf has demonstrated its potential in other fields e g dai et al 20 37 57 58 zahedi et al 84 compared to arima and mlp rf was a competitive tool rf was less accurate during peak periods which may be due to the random selection of a training set that did not cover a sufficient number of peak learning periods this can be achieved by training the rf separately for dry and wet periods 86 4 1 2 3 k nearest neighbor another studied non linear modeling approach is the k nearest neighbor method here the prediction is based on looking for similar pairs of data located in the past then the weight is assigned to the selected pair classified as the nearest neighbors the strict dependence on past data makes the k nearest neighbor weak for a situation that has not been mapped in the past 72 therefore a longer sampling period is required to minimize the chance of unpredictable situations especially in combined sewer systems on the other hand as the size of the problem increases the computational expense grows 63 86 kim et al 44 achieved rmse 5 82 for cod in wet conditions using a dataset based on three years of daily inflow characteristics sampling 4 1 2 4 multivariate adaptive regression splines the multivariate adaptive regression splines mars model was used for cod and total phosphorus prediction in norway 79 mars can describe both the linearity and non linearity of the data and can indicate points with significant change 79 wang et al 79 used only six days of hourly samples during cold and warm seasons for model calibration the model s accuracy was r2 0 892 0 889 for cod and total phosphorus respectively however the warm season did not cover any rain events so validation of the mars model is required to confirm its robustness the ability of mars for bod prediction was shown by baki et al 6 mars was compared with the classical regression analysis artificial bee colony and teaching learning algorithm from the tested algorithm mars gave the best results r2 0 9 and 0 8 for training and testing from the tested algorithms mars was able to predict peak periods which is a well known advantage of mars on the other hand mars tends to overfit leading to lower model accuracy 4 2 hybrid models hybrid models so called grey box models were developed to overcome the drawbacks of purely mechanistic and data driven models first it is often challenging to design a mechanistic model of a complex system due to the lack of deeper understanding e g of different biological or chemical processes even though a complex mechanistic model can be theoretically designed its complexity may prevent its practical use as a control tool due to the excessive requirements for computational power 4 secondly data driven models are dependent on the existence of large datasets when the dataset is insufficient prior knowledge can help to cover data sparsity for instance prior knowledge about the behavior of variables in approaching the asymptote can be used to enrich a data driven model 71 combining the models has become popular across the world and many research groups have focused on developing such models 4 19 33 48 64 the term hybrid models also refers to the combination of two or more data driven models combining the advantages of multiple models provides more comprehensive information about historical data and can increase the model s accuracy 80 for instance man et al 54 developed hybrid artificial intelligence algorithms for cod and inflow prediction arma and vector auto regression var algorithms were used for inflow rate and cod forecasting as was mentioned above arma models are suitable for flow rate prediction due to the stationarity of historical data conversely several variables affect cod concentration and therefore var was used for its prediction this combination appeared to be strong and the forecasting accuracy was up to 99 hybrid models can help address specific problems leading to more accurate prediction forecasting 89 wang et al 80 combined two types of ann convolutional neural network cnn and long short term memory lstm in a cnn lstm model for cod flow and cod mass flow prediction when the cod and flow were predicted separately and cod mass flow was then calculated from predicted parameters the results were worse maximum relative error 5 13 than using direct prediction for cod mass flow maximum relative error 2 11 since the error allowed for aeration control is 5 separate cod and flow prediction with subsequent calculation of cod mass flow is not suitable in industry 80 compared to the use of a single cnn and lstm the cnn lstm hybrid model provides better stability with significantly fluctuating data it can also remember more extended sequences 7 which can be helpful while processing a long period of sampled data the required longer training time is compensated for with less training epochs required and higher model accuracy 7 the main characteristics determining the use of selected models are summarized in table 1 an overview of publications dealing with inflow prediction at full scale wwtp is summarized in table 2 5 limitations of the existing research when comparing studies published in the field of predictive models of wastewater quality one has to consider serious biases given to the inconsistent quality of these studies this section describes the important and most frequent of these issues 5 1 models applicability and challenges existing models use datasets of various quality table 2 the calibration of the model on weekly or daily data only leads to probable lower accuracy during daily fluctuations therefore the use of daily data for calibration is not suitable for using the developed model for short term event predictions that are crucial for managing the treatment plant thus although a model may exhibit high accuracy on daily or weekly data it does not necessarily mean that the model will eventually be implemented in practice unless its accuracy is verified on another dataset the lack of model validation is one of the limitations in the literature based on the literature review the accurate purpose formulation for the predictive model implementation is missing in many studies or is vaguely explained the most frequently referred purpose is to save energy and operational costs however the exact approach is missing the most frequently reported approach is the optimization of aeration and chemical dosing which is based on daily fluctuations these fluctuations are ignored in studies where daily or weekly inflow characteristics prediction is applied table 2 if the approach for operational savings is first clearly defined the direction of modeling and the need for specific data inputs can be positively affected i e which parameters are to be measured with what frequency resulting in the reduced expenses for the sampling equipment and workforce another drawback is a significant difference in providing information about the tested area in the studies the model s accuracy and practicality can be evaluated only when complete information about the data and locality is provided for instance calibration of the mathematical models based on historical quality and quantity parameters and omitting the weather aspects leads to the unreliability of the models in unexpected situations 78 on the other hand when the sewer network is separated from the rainwater the model can be valid the information about the sewer system is crucial for evaluating the model s accuracy and practicality in the reviewed literature most studies tested one mathematical model to discuss its suitability for inflow characteristics predictions and suggest improvements for further research only a few researchers 5 78 86 87 focused on comparing several mathematical approaches to find the best algorithm for the specific case study these studies significantly impact the possible implementation of predictive models in practice since the pros and cons for specific situations are described developing a mathematical model to predict effluent parameters is another way to use the measured data at the inflow rate nourani et al 61 used three different ai non linear methods feed forward neural network ffnn adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis support vector machines svm and a classical multi linear regression mlr to predict cod bod and total nitrogen tn in the effluent of nicosia cyprus wwtp one year of daily measured data in the influent and effluent was used as an input ph conductivity bod cod and total nitrogen and target bod cod tn of the model anfis 5 1 five inputs and one output neuron had the best effluent predictive ability with determination coefficients for bod cod and tn of 0 74 0 94 and 0 96 respectively this study improved the usability of non linear models for multiple parameters with a good fit using data from the predicted or forecasted inflow parameters instead of physically measured data on site is another challenge for research in the field of wwtp optimization 5 2 data accessibility and real time transfer wastewater treatment plants are still far behind in the digital transition compared to other industries 77 most of the published studies rely solely on historical data when the developed model is used at full scale real time data transfer from sensors to the model must be ensured due to the high sensitivity of the data finding the best means for such transfer can be the most crucial part of the prediction application the use of cyber safe cloud systems is a common practice in other fields therefore there is great potential for implementing these in the water industry in addition to developing a suitable algorithm very few studies deal with subsequent implementation in practice vezzaro et al 75 focused on predicting ammonia concentration in the influent of wwtp in damhusaaen and viby denmark both wwtp were equipped with an ion selective sensor for ammonia concentration measurement and the obtained data were sent to the cloud based system aquavista for automatic control the model s accuracy was only 75 caused by insufficient weather prediction dry and wet season classification only improper calibration of the ion selective sensor and only a short period of sensor operation it was shown that it is possible to ensure safe data transfer which is usually the most critical part for operators and the reason for the lack of willingness to use such tools a comprehensive project on wwtp digitalization was recently published by wallin and nordlander 77 a complete transformation of wwtp into the digital environment including wwtp model development historical data extraction new online measured data extraction the connection of the model to the data storage output description and result storage was introduced this study showed a good practice of safe data transition and processing at wwtp leading to better process control similar studies are required to bridge the theory to practice gap in the conservative wastewater processing field 5 3 uncertainty quantification one of the aspects potentially limiting the application of data driven models in wwtp practice is the lack of a methodological approach for uncertainty quantification 28 38 uncertainty represents the reliability and efficacy of a data driven mathematical model before the model is used 1 as in natural aquatic streams 59 the inflow parameters can be affected by uncertain parameters such as the weather forecast the uncertainty of wwtp models is usually quantified by monte carlo simulation 9 11 12 55 67 68 uncertain quantification was not discussed in the reviewed research for inflow prediction and forecasting 6 advanced control strategies good practice the application of data driven models may not only serve for predicting and subsequent sustainable wwtp performance but can also significantly decrease wwtp operational costs this section will focus on full scale examples of good practices using model predictive control for better wwtp performance and smart solutions to reduce electricity and other operational costs using the existing sensing infrastructure wwtp transfer to the digital environment allows testing of various event scenarios without the treatment process intervention simulating the operational strategies to achieve energy and cost savings is possible borzooei et al 13 developed a digital simulation of the most prominent italian wwtp the wwtp was simulated using activated sludge model no 1 32 this study aimed to find the main trade off between energy savings and nutrient discharges by finding the optimum solids retention time as the main control parameter of the wwtp keeping the solids retention time within an optimal range was then ensured by the pi controller and waste activated sludge flow rate manipulation scenario analyses showed that a change in operating parameters can lead to a reduction in annual electricity consumption by 5000 mwh moreover the effluent quality index was reduced by 8 10 the same wwtp weather based influent scenarios were tested for aeration strategy improvement 14 incorporating this wwtp management strategy can potentially save 4 1 6 8 of the energy consumed for aeration in drewnowski 23 an innovative control unit previsys zapsoft ltd with data transferred from scada supervisory control and data acquisition and mpc model predictive control was used as an advanced supervisory control system for biological nutrient removal at a full scale wwtp the wastewater process modeling software west dhi denmark was used to conduct different operation strategies this study aimed to reduce electricity needs by optimizing the aeration system since the aeration system consumes 45 75 of the required electric power 51 the optimization of tested wwtp energy consumption was based on improving the aeration and internal recirculation control moreover the online data driven measurement of do no3 and nh4 using mathematical modeling and simulation was used to check the data uncertainty and develop a support operator system the energy consumption was significantly reduced 16 using the double checking data system with further optimization of the introduced control system achieving an even higher reduction in electricity usage should be possible stentoft et al 69 proposed a novel strategy for cost savings and intelligent use of more green energy e g wind turbines by default aeration control is based on the online measurement of ammonium and nitrate rule based control strategy the paper proposed a novel model predictive control mpc driven by stochastic differential equations genetic optimization was proposed to prioritize aeration during cheap energy periods resulting in reduced operational costs the model was calibrated with data from the wwtp at nørre snede 4500 pe the results showed that the rule based control strategy was approx 20 more expensive despite the results being based only on dry periods the mpc introduced is a move to integrate innovative power solutions into wwtp the idea of wastewater treatment during the cheap energy period was expanded in stentoft et al 70 and the applicability was further explained a novel attitude for connecting smart grid electricity with wwtp was introduced by stentoft et al 70 and demonstrated on the kolding denmark wwtp as in stentoft et al 69 and stentoft et al 70 the costs for aeration units decreased in stentoft et al 70 the sewer capacity was used to store wastewater during the dry periods forward knowledge of the inflow made it possible to calculate the free capacity of the sewer system thus wastewater could be retained in the sewer and pumped to the wwtp during a cheap energy period this model predictive control reacts to the 24 h pollution loads forecast and electricity prices a rainfall prediction by numerical weather prediction is included in the mpc the mpc switches back to a rule based control strategy to avoid sewer overflow when rain is predicted the 7 day trial period showed that the monetary savings were quantified to 200 dkk per day when fully exploiting the allowed storage capacity although such a monetary value is negligible compared to other treatment plant expenses the study pointed to the practical use of predictive model control the presented applications show how advanced control strategies might be used of course this potential cannot always be widely transferable for instance if both rainwater and municipal wastewater are present in the sewage system their retention in the sewage system will be problematic or impossible on the other hand a potential use can be adapted to the capabilities of individual applications advanced control strategies involve developing and using software for process modeling simulations in specific systems and energy and cost balance calculations 7 conclusions research into predictive models for inflow characteristics prediction and forecasting has risen recently this article analyzed current research on the use of prediction and inflow forecasts for a wastewater treatment plant we aimed to find the research trends evaluate the suitability of developed models and propose the optimization of further research in order to accelerate the transition from theory to practice most of the reviewed studies investigate the use of neural networks however other models have shown comparable or better results i e k nearest neighbor random forest or multivariate adaptive regression splines for the joint prediction of qualitative and quantitative parameters the development of so called hybrid models can play an important role in practice they have demonstrated a high degree of adaptability and higher accuracy than a single modeling method it is impossible to identify one universally best approach from the reviewed literature as the manuscripts differ significantly in the quality and quantity of data used the nature of the historical data and the predicted characteristic also have a major influence on the selection of a suitable tool and have to be considered when choosing the optimal model a majority of the studies deal with the usability of one specific model to predict a given parameter only a few studies deal with finding the best possible algorithm for a given subject moreover most studies end up calibrating the model using historical data for using predictive models in practice it is necessary to go one step further and ensure the connection of online measured data using hardware sensors with the developed model and ensure the security of this data this topic is discussed very little in the literature predictive models can optimize the treatment plant s management and lead to their more advanced use for saving energy and costs at a wwtp for instance smart grid electricity was introduced in the literature the use of sewer system capacity for wastewater storage in a high energy tariff period can help to decrease treatment costs declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

12856,arsenite as ιιι is one of the most toxic contaminants in surface and underground waters that needs to be removed from aquatic environments as it has harmful effects on human health and other living organisms in this study copper slag supported nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi copper slag adsorbent is used to reduce the concentration of as ιιι from an aqueous environment up to a permissible level nzvi copper slag adsorbent was prepared using fe3 reduction by bh fe sem edx xrd ftir bet vsm and zeta potential were utilized for characterization of the adsorbent synthesis in this study effective parameters on the as ιιι removal were made into a function of initial concentration adsorbent dosage and ph of the solution at a constant time of 5 min using design expert software the results of experiments showed that only 7 9 g l of nzvi copper slag adsorbent in 5 min and ph of 5 4 can remove 99 of as ιιι with the initial concentration of 20 mg l in aqueous solution among different isotherms the langmuir model with a maximum adsorption capacity of 4 27 mg g could describe as ιιι adsorption model in addition it was found that adsorption followed the pseudo second order kinetics model the amount of iron fe leached from the adsorbent surface of nzvi copper slag has been significantly reduced by using pure copper slag as a substrate in 3 consecutive cycles furthermore nzvi copper slag adsorbent can be separated from aqueous media by applying an external magnetic field due to its magnetic properties and high weight of pure copper slag graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords arsenic ιιι adsorption copper slag drinking water heavy metals nano zero valent iron 1 introduction arsenic is one of the most toxic and carcinogenic chemical elements which is recognized by the world health organization who as a major toxic contaminant according to their suggestions the concentration of this element in drinking water must be 1 μg l 1 a high concentration of as ιιι leads to side effects like skin liver lung kidney and bladder cancers or even death 2 due to its high concentration in some areas and its effects on drinking water or food products as ιιι removal is necessary in areas where fresh water is scarce there is an urgent need for municipal and industrial wastewater treatment 3 4 several attempts have been dedicated to the removal of as ιιι from drinking water with different methods like ion exchange oxidation and reduction membrane filtration and coagulation 5 6 one of the main shortcomings of these technologies is the high operational and maintenance costs so they are not economical for as ιιι removal nowadays adsorption technology is known as a simple and effective method for as ιιι removal from wastewaters this is due to its relatively high removal efficiency economic efficiency simple application recoverability and environmental compatibility 7 8 in recent years different types of adsorbents such as clay minerals oxides metal organic frameworks and various other types that include zeolite reduced graphene oxide 9 and iron oxide coated sand 10 have been used to remove as ιιι ions from the aqueous environments iron and iron hydroxides are among the most widely used adsorbents that have a strong tendency to adsorb as ιιι 8 one of these adsorbents is nano zero valent iron nzvi which has received a lot of attention due to its high active area and high as iii adsorption capacity 11 however nzvi in powder form has some deficiencies like low stability high tendency to accumulate and agglomeration followed by a decrease in specific surface area and percentage of as ιιι removal in addition nzvi may penetrate into subsurface water resources leading to numerous environmental risks 12 therefore different methods have been applied to stabilize and increase the activity of nzvi and overcome this problem in recent studies nzvi has been stabilized on different substrates to reduce deficiencies and increase its recovery the presence of nzvi on the montmorillonite mt nzvi substrate reduces its tendency for agglomeration and prevents the creation of large particles 13 based on the experimental results mt nzvi in comparison with montmorillonite and nzvi has a higher adsorption capacity iron loading has a significant role in adsorption of as iii on adsorbent 14 however loading nzvi in fuller s earth by 25 reduces the absorption of as ιιι diatomite contains negative ions and it is an inexpensive material that can be used as a substrate due to its catalyst capability 15 diatomite alone can remove 25 5 while its composite with nzvi can remove 90 of as ιιι per 1 h of contact time to remove as ιιι from aqueous solutions activated carbon was used as a substrate for nzvi because of its porous structure 16 kinetic studies showed that about 75 of as ιιι is removed after 1 h and equilibrium is reached after 2 h reduced graphite oxide rgo has been used as a support for nzvi due to its high surface area 17 the nzvi rgo adsorbent is able to reduce low concentrations of as ιιι to the permitted level according to who standards the zirconium 1 4 dicarboxybenzene metal organic framework uio 66 mof is used as a template to increase the distribution and activity of nzvi 18 the mof nzvi adsorbent has been reported to have good reusability and high removal efficiency of as iii another global challenge is the production and disposal of a large volume of industrial by products 19 in order to discharge or dispose of large quantities of these products a large surface area of soil is required which causes damage to the environment 20 recycling or reusing industrial by products can reduce these problems and costs to a great extent recently industrial by products of metallic exploitations like copper slag 21 iron sand 22 iron manganese oxide coated sand 23 sulphuric acid acidified laterite 24 blast furnace slag 25 and similar materials have been used for as ιιι removal from aqueous solutions due to their availability simple utilization and low costs however these adsorbents still have some limitations like low adsorption capacity and long reaction time these days an effective method to increase adsorption capacity and efficiency of industrial by products is improvement in removal efficiency using nzvi in this paper pure copper slag is used owing to its high mechanical strength and stability as a substrate of nzvi copper slag is an industrial by product obtained during matte smelting and copper refining 26 the prime novelties of this work are 1 loading nzvi on copper slag to prepare an efficient adsorbent 2 using nzvi copper slag adsorbent higher amounts of as ιιι can be removed in only 5 min 3 nzvi copper slag adsorbent due to its high weight can be easily separated from the aqueous solutions 4 the use of copper slag as a substrate has significantly reduced the leaching rate of fe 5 there is less environmental concern about the release of nzvi into the surface and subsurface water resources and 6 the adsorbent can be reused in several cycles without reducing performance in this study the removal of as iii from aqueous solutions was investigated using nzvi copper slag and the objectives of the research were 1 synthesis and characterization of nzvi copper slag adsorbent 2 the effect of different parameters like contact time initial concentration adsorbent dosage and ph of as ιιι on the adsorption process was investigated 3 adsorption isotherms and kinetics were examined and 4 reusability fe leached and regeneration of nzvi copper slag adsorbent in 3 consecutive cycles for as ιιι removal was explored 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents and chemicals the pure copper slag used in this study was purchased from pishro ravesh parseh

h2so₄ sodium hydroxide naoh and sodium meta arsenite were purchased from merck company 2 2 synthesis of nzvi copper slag for preparation of nzvi copper slag adsorbent 10 g of the copper slag was added to 50 ml of the h2so4 0 1 m and the solution was stirred for 3 h at 60 c fig 1 then copper slag was removed from the acid solution and washed with deionized water several times and then it was washed with ethanol the samples were dried at 100 c for 15 h in the oven nzvi was synthesized by conventional method of reducing fe iii with nabh4 in presence of copper slag as a supporting material first 0 8 g of the copper slag and fecl3 6h2o were added to the three neck flask then the water ethanol mixture 20 ml 3 2 v v was added this mixture was stirred with magnetic stirrer for 20 min following this nabh4 solution 1 g of the nabh4 in 20 ml of deionized water was added to the flask solution drop by drop and the solution was stirred for another 20 min under constant condition 27 the whole process was completed under pure nitrogen gas while stirring to avoid oxidization of the adsorbent the black and white sediment was washed with water ethanol mixture 50 ml 3 2 v v and dried for 24 h under n2 atmosphere at 60 c finally the synthesized adsorbent was transferred to a container with a lid to avoid oxidization and reduction in efficiency 2 3 characterization of nzvi copper slag the structure and morphology of pure copper slag and nzvi copper slag adsorbent was investigated using field emission scanning electron microscope fe sem tescan mira 3 model equipped with samx detector the elemental composition of the adsorbent was determined using an energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx tescan vega 3 x ray diffraction xrd was defined by pw1730 philips device netherlands equipped

were determined by horiba system japan and finally the as ιιι content of the solution was measured by the coupled plasma mass spectrometer model elmer 2 4 adsorption experiments as ιιι removal experiments with nzvi copper slag adsorbent were conducted at room temperature 25 c and open laboratory condition aerobic while the solution was stirred continuously different parameters that could affect as ιιι adsorption were examined including contact time initial concentration of as ιιι adsorbent dosage and initial ph of the solution the initial ph of different solutions was determined with hcl and naoh dilutes solutions adsorption studies were performed with 10 ml of as ιιι solution and a corresponding amount of freshly prepared nzvi copper slag adsorbent after 5 min the samples were centrifuged for 3 min at 7000 rpm the residual as ιιι in the solution at time t was measured with icp ms system and the amount of as ιιι adsorption on the surface of nzvi copper slag was calculated using eq 1 1 q v c i c t m in this equation q is the amount of adsorbed as ιιι on the surface of the adsorbent v is the solution volume and m is the mass of adsorbent ci and ct refer to the initial concentration at t 0 and concentration at any time t respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization the fe sem images of pure copper slag before and after loading with nzvi are shown in fig 2 on the pure copper slag surface fig 2a some irregular gray particles related to magnetite particles can be observed 28 in fig 2b the size of uploaded nzvi on the surface of copper slag is not homogeneous and some of them tend to make chain like structures due to their magnetic properties van der waals forces and high surface energy 13 29 based on the results average nzvi particles size is 32 nm particle size of nzvi copper slag was determined by particle size analyzer the edx analysis results of nzvi copper slag showed major components like oxygen o iron fe and silicon si fig 3 experimental results showed an increase in iron weight percentage in copper slag from 19 46 to 44 71 after loading nzvi it showed that nzvi has been successfully loaded on the surface of copper slag the results were further supported by the xrd measurements iron weight percentage of nzvi copper slag obtained was found to be higher than the other adsorbents kaolin nzvi 20 30 mof nzvi 16 7 18 d nzvi 8 61 15 and ac nzvi 8 2 16 this causes an increase in the performance and efficiency of nzvi copper slag adsorbent in removing as ιιι from aqueous solutions xrd pattern related to nzvi pure copper slag and nzvi copper slag in diffraction angles of 20 to 90 is shown in fig 4 fig 4a is related to nzvi and shows three peaks of 44 49 65 05 and 82 34 at of 2θ pointing to the iron plains of 110 200 and 211 respectively 31 the 35 72 peak of the diffraction at 2θ can be related to maghemite and magnetite due to the nzvi oxidization during synthesis process 31 the average crystal size at 2θ of 44 49 can be estimated using scherrer correlation eq 2 with k as a constant related to the crystal shape 2 d kλ βcos θ λ is the wavelength of the x ray emitted to the sample 0 15406 nm θ is the bragg angle and β is full width at half maximum 32 33 the average crystal size is calculated as 30 nm that is consistent with fe sem results the values obtained were less than the average crystallite size of nzvi like 59 08 nm 2 72 nm 34 and 42 nm 35 in fig 4b a morph peak of pure copper slag has a wide peak in the range of 20 to 40 36 37 in fig 4c the peak of 44 49 is observed at 2θ that shows nzvi presence on the surface of nzvi copper slag adsorbent 38 further the peak at 81 9 is related to nzvi of iron oxide 31 39 diffraction at 2θ of 35 5 is related to fe2o3 variants because of nzvi oxidization during the synthesis process 40 wide peak at the range of 20 to 40 is related to the copper slag structure which is also available in nzvi copper slag pattern fig 4c it shows that copper slag structure after reaction with nzvi has not faded rather this peak weakens after nzvi loading 41 the degree of crystallinity of the samples is determined using the eq 3 and through xrd deconvolution 3 x c a c a c a a 100 ac is the area of the peaks representing the entire crystalline region and aa is the area below the peaks representing the entire amorphous region 42 the values of crystallinity are 34 28 13 39 and 22 14 for nzvi copper slag and nzvi copper slag adsorbents respectively the ftir spectrum in the range of 400 4000 cm 1 has been used to detect active surface groups on nzvi pure copper slag and nzvi copper slag adsorbent in fig 5a with regard to nzvi the peak at 3425 5 cm 1 is related to the tensile vibration of the oh group 43 44 adsorption peak at 455 2 cm 1 shows the vibrations of feo bonds of fe3o4 and fe2o3 30 45 the 1342 4 cm 1 peak can be attributed to the fe3o4 fe2o3 bonds and formation of feooh around nzvi that shows nzvi has been synthesized 46 in fig 5b the 3444 8 and 1643 3 cm 1 peaks are related to the tension of hoh on the pure copper slag surface 14 in addition the peaks at 424 3 and 867 9 cm 1 are related to feo in fe2o3 and tension vibration of sio of tetrahedrons in silicates available within pure copper slag respectively 20 47 these results showed the presence of fe and si elements within the pure copper slag structure that is consistent with edx results in fig 5c as it can be seen a new adsorption peak is related to iron oxides at 1384 8 cm 1 and it is because of the nzvi interaction on the copper slag surface 2 48 the results from ftir showed that nzvi was successfully loaded on the copper slag the bet surface area of nzvi copper slag 3 34 m2 g was found to be higher than copper slag 1 83 m2 g therefore the surface area of copper slag after loading nzvi increased by about 82 which led to an increase in the adsorption efficiency of nzvi copper slag moisture content can affect the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent higher moisture content reduces the adsorption capacity about 6 g of nzvi copper slag adsorbent was placed in the oven at 120 c for 3 h and after cooling the weight of the adsorbent was measured again the adsorbent moisture content was calculated using the eq 4 4 moisture content w 1 w 2 w 1 100 where w1 is the sample weight before heating and w2 is the sample weight after heating in this study the moisture content of the nzvi copper slag was below 9 magnetic properties of nzvi copper slag adsorbent were investigated with vibrating sample magnetometer vsm analysis at 15 000 to 15 000 oe of the magnetic field fig s1 represents the ferromagnetic properties of nzvi or other forms of iron oxides 49 the residual loop obtained shows weak magnetic field of nzvi copper slag adsorbent that is because of copper slag in the adsorbent and weak magnetic property of nzvi the amount of saturation magnetization ms for nzvi copper slag adsorbent was found to be 3 94 emu g based on the results nzvi copper slag adsorbent has a low coercive force hc high saturation magnetization and low remanence magnetization mr therefore the synthesized adsorbent can be classified as a soft magnetic material that is easily magnetized by applying a small magnetic field however it quickly loses its magnetic moment when the field is cut off 50 therefore by applying external magnetic field the adsorbents can be easily removed from the aqueous solutions zeta potential factor evaluates the stability of colloidal suspensions to investigate the surface charge and find the ph for the point of zero charge pzc suspensions were prepared in ph range of 3 to 11 using naoh and hcl fig 6 shows the zeta potential values versus ph of the suspensions according to this data phpzc for nzvi copper slag adsorbent was found to be at ph 7 4 acidic ph contains a number of h cations and they can be adsorbed on the adsorbent surface leading to accumulation of positive charges on the adsorbent surface it is expected that under this condition non homonymous ions will be adsorbed on the surface of adsorbent 51 on the other hand at ph values higher than phpzc the h content decreases and the adsorbent surface will be negative as higher ph means lower h and the oh anion content on the surface of the adsorbent will increase 52 53 3 2 experimental design and data analysis in this study the effects of three independent parameters were investigated initial concentration adsorbent dosage and solution ph design expert software used response surface method called central composite design ccd to predict as ιιι removal from the solution ccd is very useful for regression of second order levels and it works properly for the optimization of the processes 54 in this method the number of levels for each parameter is 5 and the difference between this level and the value of α is the measure of the distance between the center point and the axis points of the experiment accordingly the software suggested 26 experimental runs and the responses are listed in table s1 3 3 statistical analysis and evaluation of experimental results the effect of each parameter or interactions between these parameters were determined by analysis of variance the p value and f value indices show the extent of effect of each parameter on the final model as it can be seen in table s2 the p values are 0 05 which shows that the selected model is acceptable and can be used for the accurate prediction of final response on the other hand the highest f value is for nzvi copper slag adsorbent dosage and proves that this parameter is the most significant parameter for final prediction of the model high value of correlation coefficient r2 0 96 confirms the high reliability of the model in prediction of as ιιι removal besides the adjusted r2 0 94 and predicted r2 0 91 are in good agreement with a difference 0 2 this approves that the selected model is suitable the ratio of signal over the noise was 23 9 that was used for the proof of the model values higher than 4 represent that the selected model is desirable finally the second order polynomial equation was selected as the ultimate model for as ιιι removal by nzvi copper slag adsorbent eq 5 is shown below 5 removal 40 02467 1 5795 7a 10 0005 9b 11 7840 5c 0 067875 ab 0 044438 ac 0 1668 7bc 0 00416818 a 2 0 6039 2b 2 1 3123 6c 2 where a b and c are the initial as ιιι concentration adsorbent dosage and solution ph respectively to check the accuracy of the suggested equation an experiment was conducted at 100 mg l initial concentration of as ιιι 10 g l adsorbent dosage 5 min contact time and solution ph 5 4 table 1 a good agreement was observed between the predicted results and the experimental results at optimized condition that shows the high reliability of selected model diagnostic charts also confirmed that the modified model is reliable and meaningful fig s2a showed that predicted responses agreed with the measured data with only a small difference that showed the high accuracy of the selected model data gathered from probability normal distribution graph for the residuals fig s2b are all located on a straight line that indicates the normal and favorable distribution of data fig s2c and d shows the random distribution of the residual values in terms of predicted values and run numbers around the zero line suggesting that they do not follow a specific pattern 3 4 effect of experimental parameters on the level of as ιιι removal percentage 3 4 1 investigating the effect of contact time on pollutant removal fig s3 shows the effect of contact time on as ιιι removal during different times from 1 to 120 min with initial as ιιι concentration of 10 mg l adsorbent dosage of 6 g l and ph 7 initially removal percentage increases sharply and after 5 min contact time does not affect as ιιι removal significantly the reason is that at the beginning of the adsorption process concentration difference exists between the solution and the surface of the adsorbent therefore at the early stages of adsorption as ιιι is transported faster from the solution towards the surface of the adsorbent after some time as these active sites are captured by as ιιι species removal percentage remains constant 55 therefore in this study all of the experiments were performed for 5 min according to the obtained results nzvi copper slag adsorbent is able to remove as ιιι from aqueous solution in a shorter time compared to mt nzvi 13 tio2 nzvi 56 ac nzvi 16 nzvi rgo 17 and nzvi manganese oxide 57 experimental results revealed that the solution system reached equilibrium after 60 min 3 4 2 effect of initial as ιιι concentration on removal efficiency fig 7a shows the effect of initial pollutant concentration on as ιιι removal percentage at 6 g l adsorbent dosage ph 7 and 5 min contact time as it can be seen in this figure at constant adsorbent dosage by gradual increase in as ιιι concentration from 10 mg l to 50 mg l the efficiency of adsorption has decreased and the reason is competition between the as ιιι molecules to occupy the active sites on the surface of the adsorbent 14 58 3 4 3 investigating the effect of adsorbent dosage on the pollutant removal efficiency one of the important parameters in increasing removal efficiency is the amount of adsorbent dosage the effect of adsorbent dosage on the as ιιι removal efficiency is shown in fig 7b with 30 mg l as ιιι concentration ph 7 and 5 min contact time by increasing the adsorbent dosage within the solution the effective surface area of the adsorbent and the number of active sites for as ιιι removal will increase 14 as it can be expected increasing the adsorbent dosage from 2 g l to 10 g l will increase as ιιι removal from 47 12 to 99 45 on the other hand at constant concentration of as ιιι by increasing adsorbent dosage the slope of the adsorption graph decreased the reason is that there are fewer as ιιι molecules per unit mass of nzvi copper slag accordingly some of the active sites on the adsorbent surface may remain unsaturated during the adsorption process 59 3 4 4 investigating the effect of solution ph on the pollutant removal ph dependent behavior can be attributed to factors such as changes in the as ιιι species in solution as well as changes in the surface charge of the nzvi copper slag adsorbent chemical distribution of the as ιιι compounds is a function of the solution ph based on the diagram of eh ph fig 8 at ph 9 the neutral state of h3aso3 is the dominant and major species of as ιιι that is adsorbed at ph 9 at alkaline condition h2aso3 is the dominant species of as ιιι 13 using the zeta potential data in section 3 1 phpzc for adsorption of the nzvi copper slag was determined to be 7 4 at ph phpzc the adsorbent surface charge is positive at the same ph range the surface of as ιιι species is neutral and consequently electric attraction and repulsion do not make sense hence adsorption of the h3aso3 will be conducted through de proteinization 16 as ph increases the positive charge on the surface of the adsorbent decreases and the adsorbent surface tends to adsorb the negative charges as a result in ph phpzc the adsorbent surface charge is negative that makes a repulsion between as ιιι anions h2aso3 within the solution and the negative surface charge of the adsorbent reduces the efficiency of as ιιι removal 13 as it can be seen in fig 9a by increasing ph from 3 to 11 the removal efficiency decreases from 80 03 to 43 87 other researchers reported similar results for the effect of ph on as ιιι removal efficiency it proves that lower ph is more favorable for as ιιι adsorption 61 since there is no electrostatic attraction at neutral ph as ιιι removal from aqueous solutions with adsorption would be more difficult 62 conversely the maximum adsorption of as ιιι by nzvi copper slag adsorbent occurs at the ph between 5 and 7 4 that shows the adsorption efficiency of the neutral ph the effect of interaction of initial concentration adsorbent dosage adsorbent dosage ph and ph initial concentration on as ιιι removal percentage are shown in fig 9b c and d respectively considering these diagrams the maximum as ιιι removal will be achieved at lower concentrations of the pollutants in the acidic environments with higher dosages of the adsorbent in other words removal above 80 of as ιιι is obtained only in the range of α 2 and α 0 table s3 therefore in order to attain higher percentages of as ιιι removal effective parameters like initial concentration of as ιιι adsorbent dosage and solution ph should be optimized at a constant time of 5 min using the numerical optimization function of design expert optimized conditions were utilized for efficient removal of as ιιι from aqueous solutions the optimum conditions for maximum removal of 99 67 of as ιιι 20 mg l initial concentration with the desirability of 1 000 were achieved at 7 9 g l adsorbent dosage ph 5 4 and contact time of 5 min fig s4 experiments were performed to compare the efficiency of pure copper slag nzvi and nzvi copper slag adsorbent at the optimum condition table 2 according to the results pure copper slag is able to remove about 5 31 of as iii from aqueous solution but after modification by nzvi its efficiency has increased and the removal rate has increased about 18 times on the other hand the percentage of as ιιι removal with pure nzvi is lower compared to the nzvi copper slag adsorbent the use of pure nzvi without substrate increases the amount of fe leaching and as a result increases environmental pollution 3 5 adsorption isotherms of as ιιι adsorption isotherms on nzvi copper slag were studied using two isotherms the langmuir and the freundlich models langmuir isotherm shows monolayer adsorption and the adsorbent surface contains a limited number of similar active sites for adsorption linear form of the langmuir isotherm is as shown in eq 6 6 c e q e 1 q max k l 1 q max c e where ce mg l and qe mg g are the concentration of molecules in equilibrium and the number of molecules adsorbed on the adsorbent surface at any time respectively qmax is the maximum adsorption capacity mg g and kl is the langmuir constant l mg which are obtained as the slope and intercept of the graph of ce qe versus ce respectively freundlich isotherm is conceptually experimental and describes multilayer adsorption the freundlich isotherm is as shown in eq 7 7 ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e where kf mg g and n are the freundlich constants regarding adsorption capacity and adsorption intensity respectively to study the as ιιι adsorption isotherm on nzvi copper slag adsorbent a number of experiments conducted at initial as ιιι concentrations of 5 35 mg l adsorbent dosage of 7 9 g l solution ph 5 4 and 24 h contact time the results of the adsorption experiments for two isotherms of langmuir and freundlich are shown in fig 10a and b respectively from these results it is concluded that the langmuir model r2 0 98 can describe as ιιι removal on nzvi copper slag adsorbent surface better than the freundlich model r2 0 89 as shown in table 3 the maximum langmuir adsorption capacity is 4 27 mg g which is higher than that of the pure copper slag 0 084 mg g 21 and d nzvi 2 73 mg g 15 moreover the freundlich constant for n was found higher than 2 70 indicating the adsorption of as ιιι on nzvi copper slag was a favorable process c 17 langmuir constant kl in this study is 11 1 l mg which is higher than the langmuir constant in previous studies mt nzvi 13 and f nzvi 14 demonstrating a strong interaction between the adsorbent and the adsorbed element one important characteristic of the parameters in langmuir adsorption is that it can predict or calculate the affinity of the adsorbent and the adsorbed material through a constant called separation factor rl this factor can define the fundamental characteristics of the langmuir isotherm and predict whether an adsorption system is favorable or unfavorable using eq 8 8 r l 1 1 k c 0 with k as the langmuir constant and c0 as the initial concentration of as ιιι the value of rl shows the type of the langmuir isotherm if 0 rl 1 as ιιι adsorption would be favorable 63 in fig 11 the values of calculated rl for the langmuir adsorption isotherms at different concentrations of as ιιι were 1 showing that as ιιι adsorption on the surface of nzvi copper slag adsorbent has a favorable trend 64 besides the value of rl tends to zero as c0 increases and it shows that as ιιι adsorption by nzvi copper slag adsorbent at higher initial concentrations of as ιιι is not favorable 65 based on the results nzvi copper slag adsorbent has higher efficiency at the lower concentrations of as ιιι 3 6 kinetics of as ιιι adsorption on nzvi copper slag adsorbent kinetics of as ιιι adsorption by nzvi copper slag adsorbent is determined using three known models of the pseudo first order pseudo second order and elovich models the linear forms of the pseudo first order and the pseudo second order models are as shown below eqs 9 and 10 9 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t 10 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e with qe and qt being adsorbed as ιιι mg l at equilibrium and at time t min respectively k1 g mg min and k2 are the constants of the kinetics these constants are calculated by plotting data as shown in eq 11 66 11 q t 1 β ln αβ 1 β lnt in this equation h is the initial adsorption mg g min as t 0 and β g mg is the desorption constant and activation energy in chemical reactions 65 67 to check the kinetics of the reactions as ιιι removal was studied at initial concentration of 100 mg l adsorbent dosage of 3 g l ph 5 4 and 60 min contact time as it is observed in fig 12a adsorption trend in first 10 min is fast with a sharp trend and 8 92 mg g 26 78 of as ιιι is adsorbed on the surface of nzvi copper slag adsorbent then the rate of reaction and adsorption decreased the reason is that initially available active sites on the surface of the nzvi copper slag adsorbent are more frequent and reaction with as ιιι takes place rapidly after a while repulsion force between the adsorbed as ιιι ions on the surface of the adsorbent and residual ions inside the solution may be observed making occupation of active sites on the surface of adsorbent very hard 68 adsorption reaches equilibrium after approximately 60 min and 9 7 mg g 29 11 of as ιιι is adsorbed on the surface of nzvi copper slag adsorbent the equilibrium time of as ιιι adsorption process on the surface of nzvi copper slag adsorbent is less than similar adsorbents like nzvi ac 72 h 16 and f nzvi 10 h 14 correlation coefficients r2 in three kinetic models of the pseudo first order fig 12b pseudo second order fig 12c and elovich fig 12d models are 0 43 0 98 and 0 81 respectively it proves that the pseudo second order model has the best adaptation with the experimental data fig 12c in addition the equilibrium adsorption capacity qe and rate constant k2 are 10 24 mg g and 0 039 g mg min respectively these values are consistent with the reported values in previous studies of as ιιι removal 13 li et al 69 reported that the electron density around fe on the copper slag surface decreases after reaction with as iii and a feoas bond is formed nzvi consists of a fe0 core and an iron oxide shell with the chemical composition feooh iron oxides are formed through the corrosion of fe0 core by water and oxygen during the synthesis process of nzvi 2 iron oxide shell plays a key role in removing contaminants 70 observed species as iii transformation in two stages after adsorption at the nzvi surface 1 the breaking of aso bonds at the nzvi surface and 2 reduction of as iii and its diffusion across the oxide thin layer and finally penetrates the fe0 core to form a thin layer of feas it can be concluded that in the as iii removal process using nzvi copper slag adsorbent in addition to maintaining the stability of nzvi copper slag also participates in the as iii adsorption reaction 3 7 reusability and regeneration of nzvi copper slag adsorbent reusability of the adsorbents is very important in terms of economy and environmental concerns reusability of nzvi copper slag adsorbent was investigated at initial as ιιι concentration of 20 mg l 7 9 g l of adsorbent dosage ph 5 4 and 5 min contact time after each cycle the adsorbent was removed from the solution by centrifuge and using icp ms spectroscopy the residual concentration of as ιιι and the desorbed iron from the surface of the adsorbent within the solution were measured then the separated adsorbent was reused for another cycle without regeneration fig 13a shows the percentage of as ιιι removal by nzvi copper slag adsorbent left axis and leaching of fe from the adsorbent right axis during 3 consecutive cycles the results showed that after 3 cycles as ιιι removal reduced from 99 13 to 76 04 this decrease is the reason of nzvi oxidation and saturation of the active sites on the surface of the adsorbent therefore adsorption capacity of nzvi copper slag adsorbent decreases gradually on the other hand the leaching of fe from nzvi copper slag adsorbent surface reduces after each cycle 4 41 1 98 mg l it is less than the amount of fe leached from nzvi adsorbent without substrate 4 9 mg l 57 fig 13b shows the percentage of the as ιιι content removal by the regeneration of nzvi copper slag adsorbent after 3 consecutive cycles after each cycle the adsorbent that had separated from the solution was stirred in 0 1 m hydrochloric acid for 4 h and then were in contact with the n2 atmosphere for 24 h and dried this causes dissolution of the corrosion products of nzvi iron oxyhydroxides produced on the nzvi copper slag surface before its reuse in another cycle 70 the percentage of as ιιι removal reduced negligibly after 3 cycles from 99 1 to 92 6 it is because some adsorption sites were occupied by as iii ions after the adsorption process desorption process did not take place however as ιιι removal by nzvi mn oxide adsorbent in the third cycle fell below 60 57 altogether it can be concluded that nzvi copper slag adsorbent with and without regeneration after 3 cycles of reusability is capable of as ιιι removal to a good extent in table 4 the comparison of nzvi copper slag adsorbent capacity with some used adsorbents for as ιιι removal has been presented briefly the prime advantages of this work are 1 cheapness and easy synthesis of nzvi copper slag adsorbent 2 high removal percentage especially in the ph range between 5 and 7 4 which makes it easy to use the adsorbent on a large scale and in neutral environmental conditions 3 nzvi copper slag adsorbent has fast kinetics even at high concentrations of as ιιι 4 the presence of copper slag as a substrate makes the adsorbent separate faster and easier 5 ability to reuse the adsorbent in consecutive cycles without reducing efficiency and 6 despite the high percentage of nzvi in the nzvi copper slag adsorbent the fe leaching rate decreased significantly this reduces environmental concerns about the release of nzvi into aquatic environments the higher amount of the synthesized dosage of nzvi copper slag in this study is due to the high mass of copper slag compared to other substrates used this resulted in reduction of the adsorption capacity of nzvi copper slag adsorbent however nzvi copper slag adsorbent in comparison with similar adsorbents in terms of weight like iron oxide coated sand iocs iron oxide coated cement iocc and blast furnace slag bfs has higher adsorption capacity therefore nzvi copper slag adsorbent can remove up to 99 as ιιι from the aqueous solution in just 5 min and the adsorption capacity increased in comparison with pure copper slag 4 conclusions in this study nzvi copper slag adsorbent was prepared by loading nzvi on the surface of pure copper slag to remove as ιιι from the aqueous solutions according to the experimental results the following conclusions are plausible nzvi copper slag adsorbent due to its high weight and magnetic properties can be easily separated from the aqueous solutions by external magnetic induction among parameters studied in this study nzvi copper slag adsorbent dosage has the highest effect on as ιιι removal percentage adsorption studies showed that nzvi copper slag adsorbent at ph 7 4 has the best performance maximum adsorption capacity at ph 5 4 was 4 27 mg g which is higher than some other adsorbents nzvi copper slag adsorbent with fast kinetics and high adsorption speed can remove as ιιι in just 5 min and adapts with the pseudo second order kinetic model adsorbent can be reused in at least 3 cycles and a significant reduction in the adsorption capability was not observed overall converting by products into low cost effective adsorbents to remove environmental pollutants can greatly reduce as ιιι removal costs and environmental concerns therefore using nzvi copper slag adsorbent more concentrations of as ιιι will be removed in a shorter time declaration of competing interest the interests of the authors of the manuscript do not conflict at all acknowledgement the authors of this study show their gratitude for financial supports of shiraz university appendix a supplementary data supplementary material image 1 appendix a

12856,arsenite as ιιι is one of the most toxic contaminants in surface and underground waters that needs to be removed from aquatic environments as it has harmful effects on human health and other living organisms in this study copper slag supported nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi copper slag adsorbent is used to reduce the concentration of as ιιι from an aqueous environment up to a permissible

effective parameters on the as ιιι removal were made into a function of initial concentration adsorbent dosage and ph of the solution at a constant time of 5 min using design expert software the results of experiments showed that only 7 9 g l of nzvi copper slag adsorbent in 5 min and ph of 5 4 can remove 99 of as ιιι with the initial concentration of 20 mg l in aqueous solution among different isotherms the langmuir model with a maximum adsorption capacity of 4 27 mg g could describe as ιιι adsorption model in addition it was found that adsorption followed the pseudo second order kinetics model the amount of iron fe leached from the adsorbent surface of nzvi copper slag has been significantly reduced by using pure copper slag as a substrate in 3 consecutive cycles furthermore nzvi copper slag adsorbent can be separated from aqueous media by applying an external magnetic field due to its magnetic properties and high weight of pure copper slag graphical abstract unlabelled

as ιιι leads to side effects like skin liver lung kidney and bladder cancers or even death 2 due to its high concentration in some areas and its effects on drinking water or food products as ιιι removal is necessary in areas where fresh water is scarce there is an urgent need for municipal and industrial wastewater treatment 3 4 several attempts have been dedicated to the removal of as ιιι from drinking water with different methods like ion exchange oxidation and reduction membrane filtration and coagulation 5 6 one of the main shortcomings of these technologies is the high operational and maintenance costs so they are not economical for as ιιι removal nowadays adsorption technology is known as a simple and effective method for as ιιι removal from wastewaters this is due to its relatively high removal efficiency economic efficiency simple application recoverability and environmental compatibility 7 8 in recent years different types of adsorbents such as clay minerals oxides metal organic frameworks and various other types that include zeolite reduced graphene oxide 9 and iron oxide coated sand 10 have been used to remove as ιιι ions from the aqueous environments iron and iron hydroxides are among the most widely used adsorbents that have a strong tendency to adsorb as ιιι 8 one of these adsorbents is nano zero valent iron nzvi which has received a lot of attention due to its high active area and high as iii adsorption capacity 11 however nzvi in powder form has some deficiencies like low stability high tendency to accumulate and agglomeration followed by a decrease in specific surface area and percentage of as ιιι removal in addition nzvi may penetrate into subsurface water resources leading to numerous environmental risks 12 therefore different methods have been applied to stabilize and increase the activity of nzvi and overcome this problem in recent studies nzvi has been stabilized on different substrates to reduce deficiencies and increase its recovery the presence of nzvi on the montmorillonite mt nzvi substrate reduces its tendency for agglomeration and prevents the creation of large particles 13 based on the experimental results mt nzvi in comparison with montmorillonite and nzvi has a higher adsorption capacity iron loading has a significant role in adsorption of as iii on adsorbent 14 however loading nzvi in fuller s earth by 25 reduces the absorption of as ιιι diatomite contains negative ions and it is an inexpensive material that can be used as a substrate due to its catalyst capability 15 diatomite alone can remove 25 5 while its composite with nzvi can remove 90 of as ιιι per 1 h of contact time to remove as ιιι from aqueous solutions activated carbon was used as a substrate for nzvi because of its porous structure 16 kinetic studies showed that about 75 of as ιιι is removed after 1 h and equilibrium is reached after 2 h reduced graphite oxide rgo has been used as a support for nzvi due to its high surface area 17 the nzvi rgo adsorbent is able to reduce low concentrations of as ιιι to the permitted level according to who standards the zirconium 1 4 dicarboxybenzene metal organic framework uio 66 mof is used as a template to increase the distribution and activity of nzvi 18 the mof nzvi adsorbent has been reported to have good reusability and high removal efficiency of as iii another global challenge is the production and disposal of a large volume of industrial by products 19 in order to discharge or dispose of large quantities of these products a large surface area of soil is required which causes damage to the environment 20 recycling or reusing industrial by products can reduce these problems and costs to a great extent recently industrial by products of metallic exploitations like copper slag 21 iron sand 22 iron manganese oxide coated sand 23 sulphuric acid acidified laterite 24 blast furnace slag 25 and similar materials have been used for as ιιι removal from aqueous solutions due to their availability simple utilization and low costs however these adsorbents still have some limitations like low adsorption capacity and long reaction time these days an effective method to increase adsorption capacity and efficiency of industrial by products is improvement in removal efficiency using nzvi in this paper pure copper slag is used owing to its high mechanical strength and stability as a substrate of nzvi copper slag is an industrial by product obtained during matte smelting and copper refining 26 the prime novelties of this work are 1 loading nzvi on copper slag to prepare an efficient adsorbent 2 using nzvi copper slag adsorbent higher amounts of as ιιι can be removed in only 5 min 3 nzvi copper slag adsorbent due to its high weight can be easily separated from the aqueous solutions 4 the use of copper slag as a substrate has significantly reduced the leaching rate of fe 5 there is less environmental concern about the release of nzvi into the surface and subsurface water resources and 6 the adsorbent can be reused in several cycles without reducing performance in this study the removal of as iii from aqueous solutions was investigated using nzvi copper slag and the objectives of the research were 1 synthesis and characterization of nzvi copper slag adsorbent 2 the effect of different parameters like contact time initial concentration adsorbent dosage and ph of as ιιι on the adsorption process was investigated 3 adsorption isotherms and kinetics were examined and 4 reusability fe leached and regeneration of nzvi copper slag adsorbent in 3 consecutive cycles for as ιιι removal was explored 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents and chemicals the pure copper slag used in this study was purchased from pishro ravesh parseh company extracted from sarcheshmeh copper mine in kerman iran sodium borohydride nabh4 aqueous ferric chloride hexahydrate fecl3 6h2o absolute ethanol 99 hydrochloric acid 37 hcl sulfuric acid 98 h2so₄ sodium hydroxide naoh and sodium meta arsenite were purchased from merck company 2 2 synthesis of nzvi copper slag for preparation of nzvi copper slag adsorbent 10 g of the copper slag was added to 50 ml of the h2so4 0 1 m and the solution was stirred for 3 h at 60 c fig 1 then copper slag was removed from the acid solution and washed with deionized water several times and then it was washed with ethanol the samples were dried at 100 c for 15 h in the oven nzvi was synthesized by conventional method of reducing fe iii with nabh4 in presence of copper slag as a supporting material first 0 8 g of the copper slag and fecl3 6h2o were added to the three neck flask then the water ethanol mixture 20 ml 3 2 v v was added this mixture was stirred with magnetic stirrer for 20 min following this nabh4 solution 1 g of the nabh4 in 20 ml of deionized water was added to the flask solution drop by drop and the solution was stirred for another 20 min under constant condition 27 the whole process was completed under pure nitrogen gas while stirring to avoid oxidization of the adsorbent the black and white sediment was washed with water ethanol mixture 50 ml 3 2 v v and dried for 24 h under n2 atmosphere at 60 c finally the synthesized adsorbent was transferred to a container with a lid to avoid oxidization and reduction in efficiency 2 3 characterization of nzvi copper slag the structure and morphology of pure copper slag and nzvi copper slag adsorbent was investigated using field emission scanning electron microscope fe sem tescan mira 3 model equipped with samx detector the elemental composition of the adsorbent was determined using an energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx tescan vega 3 x ray diffraction xrd was defined by pw1730 philips device netherlands equipped with a cu kα radiation source with a voltage of 40 kv a current of 30 ma and a step size of 0 05 the fourier transform infrared ft ir spectrum is obtained using a spectrometer ii germany the specific surface area was measured by brunauer emmett teller bet n2 adsorption method using a belsorp mini ii japan the samples were dried with constant flow of n2 at 120 c for 12 h magnetic properties were quantified with the lbkfb device kashan kavir magnet co with a maximum applied field of 1 5 t and a resolution of 2 oe in the low field and 1 oe in the high field zero charge point and zeta potential were determined by horiba system japan and finally the as ιιι content of the solution was measured by the coupled plasma mass spectrometer model elmer 2 4 adsorption experiments as ιιι removal experiments with nzvi copper slag adsorbent were conducted at room temperature 25 c and open laboratory condition aerobic while the solution was stirred continuously different parameters that could affect as ιιι adsorption were examined including contact time initial concentration of as ιιι adsorbent dosage and initial ph of the solution the initial ph of different solutions was determined with hcl and naoh dilutes solutions adsorption studies were performed with 10 ml of as ιιι solution and a corresponding amount of freshly prepared nzvi copper slag adsorbent after 5 min the samples were centrifuged for 3 min at 7000 rpm the residual as ιιι in the solution at time t was measured with icp ms system and the amount of as ιιι adsorption on the surface of nzvi copper slag was calculated using eq 1 1 q v c i c t m in this equation q is the amount of adsorbed as ιιι on the surface of the adsorbent v is the solution volume and m is the mass of adsorbent ci and ct refer to the initial concentration at t 0 and concentration at any time t respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization the fe sem images of pure copper slag before and after loading with nzvi are shown in fig 2 on the pure copper slag surface fig 2a some irregular gray particles related to magnetite particles can be observed 28 in fig 2b the size of uploaded nzvi on the surface of copper slag is not homogeneous and some of them tend to make chain like structures due to their magnetic properties van der waals forces and high surface energy 13 29 based on the results average nzvi particles size is 32 nm particle size of nzvi copper slag was determined by particle size analyzer the edx analysis results of nzvi copper slag showed major components like oxygen o iron fe and silicon si fig 3 experimental results showed an increase in iron weight percentage in copper slag from 19 46 to 44 71 after loading nzvi it showed that nzvi has been successfully loaded on the surface of copper slag the results were further supported by the xrd measurements iron weight percentage of nzvi copper slag obtained was found to be higher than the other adsorbents kaolin nzvi 20 30 mof nzvi 16 7 18 d nzvi 8 61 15 and ac nzvi 8 2 16 this causes an increase in the performance and efficiency of nzvi copper slag adsorbent in removing as ιιι from aqueous solutions xrd pattern related to nzvi pure copper slag and nzvi copper slag in diffraction angles of 20 to 90 is shown in fig 4 fig 4a is related to nzvi and shows three peaks of 44 49 65 05 and 82 34 at of 2θ pointing to the iron plains of 110 200 and 211 respectively 31 the 35 72 peak of the diffraction at 2θ can be related to maghemite and magnetite due to the nzvi oxidization during synthesis process 31 the average crystal size at 2θ of 44 49 can be estimated using scherrer correlation eq 2 with k as a constant related to the crystal shape 2 d kλ βcos θ λ is the wavelength of the x ray emitted to the sample 0 15406 nm θ is the bragg angle and β is full width at half maximum 32 33 the average crystal size is calculated as 30 nm that is consistent with fe sem results the values obtained were less than the average crystallite size of nzvi like 59 08 nm 2 72 nm 34 and 42 nm 35 in fig 4b a morph peak of pure copper slag has a wide peak in the range of 20 to 40 36 37 in fig 4c the peak of 44 49 is observed at 2θ that shows nzvi presence on the surface of nzvi copper slag adsorbent 38 further the peak at 81 9 is related to nzvi of iron oxide 31 39 diffraction at 2θ of 35 5 is related to fe2o3 variants because of nzvi oxidization during the synthesis process 40 wide peak at the range of 20 to 40 is related to the copper slag structure which is also available in nzvi copper slag pattern fig 4c it shows that copper slag structure after reaction with nzvi has not faded rather this peak weakens after nzvi loading 41 the degree of crystallinity of the samples is determined using the eq 3 and through xrd deconvolution 3 x c a c a c a a 100 ac is the area of the peaks representing the entire crystalline region and aa is the area below the peaks representing the entire amorphous region 42 the values of crystallinity are 34 28 13 39 and 22 14 for nzvi copper slag and nzvi copper slag adsorbents respectively the ftir spectrum in the range of 400 4000 cm 1 has been used to detect active surface groups on nzvi pure copper slag and nzvi copper slag adsorbent in fig 5a with regard to nzvi the peak at 3425 5 cm 1 is related to the tensile vibration of the oh group 43 44 adsorption peak at 455 2 cm 1 shows the vibrations of feo bonds of fe3o4 and fe2o3 30 45 the 1342 4 cm 1 peak can be attributed to the fe3o4 fe2o3 bonds and formation of feooh around nzvi that shows nzvi has been synthesized 46 in fig 5b the 3444 8 and 1643 3 cm 1 peaks are related to the tension of hoh on the pure copper slag surface 14 in addition the peaks at 424 3 and 867 9 cm 1 are related to feo in fe2o3 and tension vibration of sio of tetrahedrons in silicates available within pure copper slag respectively 20 47 these results showed the presence of fe and si elements within the pure copper slag structure that is consistent with edx results in fig 5c as it can be seen a new adsorption peak is related to iron oxides at 1384 8 cm 1 and it is because of the nzvi interaction on the copper slag surface 2 48 the results from ftir showed that nzvi was successfully loaded on the copper slag the bet surface area of nzvi copper slag 3 34 m2 g was found to be higher than copper slag 1 83 m2 g therefore the surface area of copper slag after loading nzvi increased by about 82 which led to an increase in the adsorption efficiency of nzvi copper slag moisture content can affect the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent higher moisture content reduces the adsorption capacity about 6 g of nzvi copper slag adsorbent was placed in the oven at 120 c for 3 h and after cooling the weight of the adsorbent was measured again the adsorbent moisture content was calculated using the eq 4 4 moisture content w 1 w 2 w 1 100 where w1 is the sample weight before heating and w2 is the sample weight after heating in this study the moisture content of the nzvi copper slag was below 9 magnetic properties of nzvi copper slag adsorbent were investigated with vibrating sample magnetometer vsm analysis at 15 000 to 15 000 oe of the magnetic field fig s1 represents the ferromagnetic properties of nzvi or other forms of iron oxides 49 the residual loop obtained shows weak magnetic field of nzvi copper slag adsorbent that is because of copper slag in the adsorbent and weak magnetic property of nzvi the amount of saturation magnetization ms for nzvi copper slag adsorbent was found to be 3 94 emu g based on the results nzvi copper slag adsorbent has a low coercive force hc high saturation magnetization and low remanence magnetization mr therefore the synthesized adsorbent can be classified as a soft magnetic material that is easily magnetized by applying a small magnetic field however it quickly loses its magnetic moment when the field is cut off 50 therefore by applying external magnetic field the adsorbents can be easily removed from the aqueous solutions zeta potential factor evaluates the stability of colloidal suspensions to investigate the surface charge and find the ph for the point of zero charge pzc suspensions were prepared in ph range of 3 to 11 using naoh and hcl fig 6 shows the zeta potential values versus ph of the suspensions according to this data phpzc for nzvi copper slag adsorbent was found to be at ph 7 4 acidic ph contains a number of h cations and they can be adsorbed on the adsorbent surface leading to accumulation of positive charges on the adsorbent surface it is expected that under this condition non homonymous ions will be adsorbed on the surface of adsorbent 51 on the other hand at ph values higher than phpzc the h content decreases and the adsorbent surface will be negative as higher ph means lower h and the oh anion content on the surface of the adsorbent will increase 52 53 3 2 experimental design and data analysis in this study the effects of three independent parameters were investigated initial concentration adsorbent dosage and solution ph design expert software used response surface method called central composite design ccd to predict as ιιι removal from the solution ccd is very useful for regression of second order levels and it works properly for the optimization of the processes 54 in this method the number of levels for each parameter is 5 and the difference between this level and the value of α is the measure of the distance between the center point and the axis points of the experiment accordingly the software suggested 26 experimental runs and the responses are listed in table s1 3 3 statistical analysis and evaluation of experimental results the effect of each parameter or interactions between these parameters were determined by analysis of variance the p value and f value indices show the extent of effect of each parameter on the final model as it can be seen in table s2 the p values are 0 05 which shows that the selected model is acceptable and can be used for the accurate prediction of final response on the other hand the highest f value is for nzvi copper slag adsorbent dosage and proves that this parameter is the most significant parameter for final prediction of the model high value of correlation coefficient r2 0 96 confirms the high reliability of the model in prediction of as ιιι removal besides the adjusted r2 0 94 and predicted r2 0 91 are in good agreement with a difference 0 2 this approves that the selected model is suitable the ratio of signal over the noise was 23 9 that was used for the proof of the model values higher than 4 represent that the selected model is desirable finally the second order polynomial equation was selected as the ultimate model for as ιιι removal by nzvi copper slag adsorbent eq 5 is shown below 5 removal 40 02467 1 5795 7a 10 0005 9b 11 7840 5c 0 067875 ab 0 044438 ac 0 1668 7bc 0 00416818 a 2 0 6039 2b 2 1 3123 6c 2 where a b and c are the initial as ιιι concentration adsorbent dosage and solution ph respectively to check the accuracy of the suggested equation an experiment was conducted at 100 mg l initial concentration of as ιιι 10 g l adsorbent dosage 5 min contact time and solution ph 5 4 table 1 a good agreement was observed between the predicted results and the experimental results at optimized condition that shows the high reliability of selected model diagnostic charts also confirmed that the modified model is reliable and meaningful fig s2a showed that predicted responses agreed with the measured data with only a small difference that showed the high accuracy of the selected model data gathered from probability normal distribution graph for the residuals fig s2b are all located on a straight line that indicates the normal and favorable distribution of data fig s2c and d shows the random distribution of the residual values in terms of predicted values and run numbers around the zero line suggesting that they do not follow a specific pattern 3 4 effect of experimental parameters on the level of as ιιι removal percentage 3 4 1 investigating the effect of contact time on pollutant removal fig s3 shows the effect of contact time on as ιιι removal during different times from 1 to 120 min with initial as ιιι concentration of 10 mg l adsorbent dosage of 6 g l and ph 7 initially removal percentage increases sharply and after 5 min contact time does not affect as ιιι removal significantly the reason is that at the beginning of the adsorption process concentration difference exists between the solution and the surface of the adsorbent therefore at the early stages of adsorption as ιιι is transported faster from the solution towards the surface of the adsorbent after some time as these active sites are captured by as ιιι species removal percentage remains constant 55 therefore in this study all of the experiments were performed for 5 min according to the obtained results nzvi copper slag adsorbent is able to remove as ιιι from aqueous solution in a shorter time compared to mt nzvi 13 tio2 nzvi 56 ac nzvi 16 nzvi rgo 17 and nzvi manganese oxide 57 experimental results revealed that the solution system reached equilibrium after 60 min 3 4 2 effect of initial as ιιι concentration on removal efficiency fig 7a shows the effect of initial pollutant concentration on as ιιι removal percentage at 6 g l adsorbent dosage ph 7 and 5 min contact time as it can be seen in this figure at constant adsorbent dosage by gradual increase in as ιιι concentration from 10 mg l to 50 mg l the efficiency of adsorption has decreased and the reason is competition between the as ιιι molecules to occupy the active sites on the surface of the adsorbent 14 58 3 4 3 investigating the effect of adsorbent dosage on the pollutant removal efficiency one of the important parameters in increasing removal efficiency is the amount of adsorbent dosage the effect of adsorbent dosage on the as ιιι removal efficiency is shown in fig 7b with 30 mg l as ιιι concentration ph 7 and 5 min contact time by increasing the adsorbent dosage within the solution the effective surface area of the adsorbent and the number of active sites for as ιιι removal will increase 14 as it can be expected increasing the adsorbent dosage from 2 g l to 10 g l will increase as ιιι removal from 47 12 to 99 45 on the other hand at constant concentration of as ιιι by increasing adsorbent dosage the slope of the adsorption graph decreased the reason is that there are fewer as ιιι molecules per unit mass of nzvi copper slag accordingly some of the active sites on the adsorbent surface may remain unsaturated during the adsorption process 59 3 4 4 investigating the effect of solution ph on the pollutant removal ph dependent behavior can be attributed to factors such as changes in the as ιιι species in solution as well as changes in the surface charge of the nzvi copper slag adsorbent chemical distribution of the as ιιι compounds is a function of the solution ph based on the diagram of eh ph fig 8 at ph 9 the neutral state of h3aso3 is the dominant and major species of as ιιι that is adsorbed at ph 9 at alkaline condition h2aso3 is the dominant species of as ιιι 13 using the zeta potential data in section 3 1 phpzc for adsorption of the nzvi copper slag was determined to be 7 4 at ph phpzc the adsorbent surface charge is positive at the same ph range the surface of as ιιι species is neutral and consequently electric attraction and repulsion do not make sense hence adsorption of the h3aso3 will be conducted through de proteinization 16 as ph increases the positive charge on the surface of the adsorbent decreases and the adsorbent surface tends to adsorb the negative charges as a result in ph phpzc the adsorbent surface charge is negative that makes a repulsion between as ιιι anions h2aso3 within the solution and the negative surface charge of the adsorbent reduces the efficiency of as ιιι removal 13 as it can be seen in fig 9a by increasing ph from 3 to 11 the removal efficiency decreases from 80 03 to 43 87 other researchers reported similar results for the effect of ph on as ιιι removal efficiency it proves that lower ph is more favorable for as ιιι adsorption 61 since there is no electrostatic attraction at neutral ph as ιιι removal from aqueous solutions with adsorption would be more difficult 62 conversely the maximum adsorption of as ιιι by nzvi copper slag adsorbent occurs at the ph between 5 and 7 4 that shows the adsorption efficiency of the neutral ph the effect of interaction of initial concentration adsorbent dosage adsorbent dosage ph and ph initial concentration on as ιιι removal percentage are shown in fig 9b c and d respectively considering these diagrams the maximum as ιιι removal will be achieved at lower concentrations of the pollutants in the acidic environments with higher dosages of the adsorbent in other words removal above 80 of as ιιι is obtained only in the range of α 2 and α 0 table s3 therefore in order to attain higher percentages of as ιιι removal effective parameters like initial concentration of as ιιι adsorbent dosage and solution ph should be optimized at a constant time of 5 min using the numerical optimization function of design expert optimized conditions were utilized for efficient removal of as ιιι from aqueous solutions the optimum conditions for maximum removal of 99 67 of as ιιι 20 mg l initial concentration with the desirability of 1 000 were achieved at 7 9 g l adsorbent dosage ph 5 4 and contact time of 5 min fig s4 experiments were performed to compare the efficiency of pure copper slag nzvi and nzvi copper slag adsorbent at the optimum condition table 2 according to the results pure copper slag is able to remove about 5 31 of as iii from aqueous solution but after modification by nzvi its efficiency has increased and the removal rate has increased about 18 times on the other hand the percentage of as ιιι removal with pure nzvi is lower compared to the nzvi copper slag adsorbent the use of pure nzvi without substrate increases the amount of fe leaching and as a result increases environmental pollution 3 5 adsorption isotherms of as ιιι adsorption isotherms on nzvi copper slag were studied using two isotherms the langmuir and the freundlich models langmuir isotherm shows monolayer adsorption and the adsorbent surface contains a limited number of similar active sites for adsorption linear form of the langmuir isotherm is as shown in eq 6 6 c e q e 1 q max k l 1 q max c e where ce mg l and qe mg g are the concentration of molecules in equilibrium and the number of molecules adsorbed on the adsorbent surface at any time respectively qmax is the maximum adsorption capacity mg g and kl is the langmuir constant l mg which are obtained as the slope and intercept of the graph of ce qe versus ce respectively freundlich isotherm is conceptually experimental and describes multilayer adsorption the freundlich isotherm is as shown in eq 7 7 ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e where kf mg g and n are the freundlich constants regarding adsorption capacity and adsorption intensity respectively to study the as ιιι adsorption isotherm on nzvi copper slag adsorbent a number of experiments conducted at initial as ιιι concentrations of 5 35 mg l adsorbent dosage of 7 9 g l solution ph 5 4 and 24 h contact time the results of the adsorption experiments for two isotherms of langmuir and freundlich are shown in fig 10a and b respectively from these results it is concluded that the langmuir model r2 0 98 can describe as ιιι removal on nzvi copper slag adsorbent surface better than the freundlich model r2 0 89 as shown in table 3 the maximum langmuir adsorption capacity is 4 27 mg g which is higher than that of the pure copper slag 0 084 mg g 21 and d nzvi 2 73 mg g 15 moreover the freundlich constant for n was found higher than 2 70 indicating the adsorption of as ιιι on nzvi copper slag was a favorable process c 17 langmuir constant kl in this study is 11 1 l mg which is higher than the langmuir constant in previous studies mt nzvi 13 and f nzvi 14 demonstrating a strong interaction between the adsorbent and the adsorbed element one important characteristic of the parameters in langmuir adsorption is that it can predict or calculate the affinity of the adsorbent and the adsorbed material through a constant called separation factor rl this factor can define the fundamental characteristics of the langmuir isotherm and predict whether an adsorption system is favorable or unfavorable using eq 8 8 r l 1 1 k c 0 with k as the langmuir constant and c0 as the initial concentration of as ιιι the value of rl shows the type of the langmuir isotherm if 0 rl 1 as ιιι adsorption would be favorable 63 in fig 11 the values of calculated rl for the langmuir adsorption isotherms at different concentrations of as ιιι were 1 showing that as ιιι adsorption on the surface of nzvi copper slag adsorbent has a favorable trend 64 besides the value of rl tends to zero as c0 increases and it shows that as ιιι adsorption by nzvi copper slag adsorbent at higher initial concentrations of as ιιι is not favorable 65 based on the results nzvi copper slag adsorbent has higher efficiency at the lower concentrations of as ιιι 3 6 kinetics of as ιιι adsorption on nzvi copper slag adsorbent kinetics of as ιιι adsorption by nzvi copper slag adsorbent is determined using three known models of the pseudo first order pseudo second order and elovich models the linear forms of the pseudo first order and the pseudo second order models are as shown below eqs 9 and 10 9 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t 10 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e with qe and qt being adsorbed as ιιι mg l at equilibrium and at time t min respectively k1 g mg min and k2 are the constants of the kinetics these constants are calculated by plotting data as shown in eq 11 66 11 q t 1 β ln αβ 1 β lnt in this equation h is the initial adsorption mg g min as t 0 and β g mg is the desorption constant and activation energy in chemical reactions 65 67 to check the kinetics of the reactions as ιιι removal was studied at initial concentration of 100 mg l adsorbent dosage of 3 g l ph 5 4 and 60 min contact time as it is observed in fig 12a adsorption trend in first 10 min is fast with a sharp trend and 8 92 mg g 26 78 of as ιιι is adsorbed on the surface of nzvi copper slag adsorbent then the rate of reaction and adsorption decreased the reason is that initially available active sites on the surface of the nzvi copper slag adsorbent are more frequent and reaction with as ιιι takes place rapidly after a while repulsion force between the adsorbed as ιιι ions on the surface of the adsorbent and residual ions inside the solution may be observed making occupation of active sites on the surface of adsorbent very hard 68 adsorption reaches equilibrium after approximately 60 min and 9 7 mg g 29 11 of as ιιι is adsorbed on the surface of nzvi copper slag adsorbent the equilibrium time of as ιιι adsorption process on the surface of nzvi copper slag adsorbent is less than similar adsorbents like nzvi ac 72 h 16 and f nzvi 10 h 14 correlation coefficients r2 in three kinetic models of the pseudo first order fig 12b pseudo second order fig 12c and elovich fig 12d models are 0 43 0 98 and 0 81 respectively it proves that the pseudo second order model has the best adaptation with the experimental data fig 12c in addition the equilibrium adsorption capacity qe and rate constant k2 are 10 24 mg g and 0 039 g mg min respectively these values are consistent with the reported values in previous studies of as ιιι removal 13 li et al 69 reported that the electron density around fe on the copper slag surface decreases after reaction with as iii and a feoas bond is formed nzvi consists of a fe0 core and an iron oxide shell with the chemical composition feooh iron oxides are formed through the corrosion of fe0 core by water and oxygen during the synthesis process of nzvi 2 iron oxide shell plays a key role in removing contaminants 70 observed species as iii transformation in two stages after adsorption at the nzvi surface 1 the breaking of aso bonds at the nzvi surface and 2 reduction of as iii and its diffusion across the oxide thin layer and finally penetrates the fe0 core to form a thin layer of feas it can be concluded that in the as iii removal process using nzvi copper slag adsorbent in addition to maintaining the stability of nzvi copper slag also participates in the as iii adsorption reaction 3 7 reusability and regeneration of nzvi copper slag adsorbent reusability of the adsorbents is very important in terms of economy and environmental concerns reusability of nzvi copper slag adsorbent was investigated at initial as ιιι concentration of 20 mg l 7 9 g l of adsorbent dosage ph 5 4 and 5 min contact time after each cycle the adsorbent was removed from the solution by centrifuge and using icp ms spectroscopy the residual concentration of as ιιι and the desorbed iron from the surface of the adsorbent within the solution were measured then the separated adsorbent was reused for another cycle without regeneration fig 13a shows the percentage of as ιιι removal by nzvi copper slag adsorbent left axis and leaching of fe from the adsorbent right axis during 3 consecutive cycles the results showed that after 3 cycles as ιιι removal reduced from 99 13 to 76 04 this decrease is the reason of nzvi oxidation and saturation of the active sites on the surface of the adsorbent therefore adsorption capacity of nzvi copper slag adsorbent decreases gradually on the other hand the leaching of fe from nzvi copper slag adsorbent surface reduces after each cycle 4 41 1 98 mg l it is less than the amount of fe leached from nzvi adsorbent without substrate 4 9 mg l 57 fig 13b shows the percentage of the as ιιι content removal by the regeneration of nzvi copper slag adsorbent after 3 consecutive cycles after each cycle the adsorbent that had separated from the solution was stirred in 0 1 m hydrochloric acid for 4 h and then were in contact with the n2 atmosphere for 24 h and dried this causes dissolution of the corrosion products of nzvi iron oxyhydroxides produced on the nzvi copper slag surface before its reuse in another cycle 70 the percentage of as ιιι removal reduced negligibly after 3 cycles from 99 1 to 92 6 it is because some adsorption sites were occupied by as iii ions after the adsorption process desorption process did not take place however as ιιι removal by nzvi mn oxide adsorbent in the third cycle fell below 60 57 altogether it can be concluded that nzvi copper slag adsorbent with and without regeneration after 3 cycles of reusability is capable of as ιιι removal to a good extent in table 4 the comparison of nzvi copper slag adsorbent capacity with some used adsorbents for as ιιι removal has been presented briefly the prime advantages of this work are 1 cheapness and easy synthesis of nzvi copper slag adsorbent 2 high removal percentage especially in the ph range between 5 and 7 4 which makes it easy to use the adsorbent on a large scale and in neutral environmental conditions 3 nzvi copper slag adsorbent has fast kinetics even at high concentrations of as ιιι 4 the presence of copper slag as a substrate makes the adsorbent separate faster and easier 5 ability to reuse the adsorbent in consecutive cycles without reducing efficiency and 6 despite the high percentage of nzvi in the nzvi copper slag adsorbent the fe leaching rate decreased significantly this reduces environmental concerns about the release of nzvi into aquatic environments the higher amount of the synthesized dosage of nzvi copper slag in this study is due to the high mass of copper slag compared to other substrates used this resulted in reduction of the adsorption capacity of nzvi copper slag adsorbent however nzvi copper slag adsorbent in comparison with similar adsorbents in terms of weight like iron oxide coated sand iocs iron oxide coated cement iocc and blast furnace slag bfs has higher adsorption capacity therefore nzvi copper slag adsorbent can remove up to 99 as ιιι from the aqueous solution in just 5 min and the adsorption capacity increased in comparison with pure copper slag 4 conclusions in this study nzvi copper slag adsorbent was prepared by loading nzvi on the surface of pure copper slag to remove as ιιι from the aqueous solutions according to the experimental results the following conclusions are plausible nzvi copper slag adsorbent due to its high weight and magnetic properties can be easily separated from the aqueous solutions by external magnetic induction among parameters studied in this study nzvi copper slag adsorbent dosage has the highest effect on as ιιι removal percentage adsorption studies showed that nzvi copper slag adsorbent at ph 7 4 has the best performance maximum adsorption capacity at ph 5 4 was 4 27 mg g which is higher than some other adsorbents nzvi copper slag adsorbent with fast kinetics and high adsorption speed can remove as ιιι in just 5 min and adapts with the pseudo second order kinetic model adsorbent can be reused in at least 3 cycles and a significant reduction in the adsorption capability was not observed overall converting by products into low cost effective adsorbents to remove environmental pollutants can greatly reduce as ιιι removal costs and environmental concerns therefore using nzvi copper slag adsorbent more concentrations of as ιιι will be removed in a shorter time declaration of competing interest the interests of the authors of the manuscript do not conflict at all acknowledgement the authors of this study show their gratitude for financial supports of shiraz university appendix a supplementary data supplementary material image 1 appendix a

12857,microalgae have become an important means of wastewater treatment as a sustainable and economical method of wastewater treatment microalgae not only purify wastewater from different sources but also use wastewater as growth matrix to produce valuable biological products biomaterials and bioenergy however given the complexity of compounds in wastewater and the challenge of increasing removal efficiency at a lower cost through treatment technology optimization more research is required in this paper the application of indigenous microalgae in wastewater treatment was analyzed and the wastewater was divided into four parts nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus chemical oxygen demand cod and biological oxygen demand bod contaminants of emerging concern and heavy metals in addition the joint treatment of wastewater by microalgae and other methods such as microalgae yeast system microalgae bacteria system microalgae constructed wetland system and microalgae sludge system were also discussed finally the immobilization technology of microalgae and the future development trend and challenges of microalgae in the treatment of water pollution are analyzed this will provide useful information for wastewater treatment graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords microalgae water pollution wastewater treatment co culture treatment data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction water is a resource for human survival however with the continuous development of society and the increasing water consumption a large amount of wastewater has been produced in the use of water resources such as industrial wastewater food wastewater domestic wastewater etc wastewater contains a lot of nutrient elements such as nitrogen and phosphorus heavy metals such as lead contaminants of emerging concern according to the data of china s national bureau of statistics 1 in 2020 total nitrogen emissions and total phosphorus emissions reached 3 223 400 tons and 336 700 tons respectively the cod emission in 2020 is five times that in 2019 reaching 25 6476 million tons the total emission of heavy metals such as lead reached 26 680 kg if the wastewater is discharged into the wastewater without treatment these pollutants in the wastewater will not only threaten aquatic organisms but also endanger human health 2 at present the main treatment methods of wastewater pollution are physical method screening filtration sedimentation filtration membrane chemical method chemical precipitation adsorption electrochemical treatment ion exchange 3 biological method biosorption bioprecipitation 4 the advantages of these methods are to remove substances in different wastewater and use different methods to remove pollutants for example filtration method can filter large and small particles and ion exchange method can remove heavy metals in wastewater these treatment technologies also have some disadvantages such as uneven removal efficiency high installation cost and uneconomical which may cause secondary pollution and increase the difficulty of subsequent treatment 5 algae is a single celled organism composed of prokaryotes and eukaryotes algae can be divided into macroalgae and microalgae microalgae are tiny groups of algae that can only be identified under a microscope so far 15 7 104 species of microalgae have been recognized with many more yet to be discovered 6 the principal groups of microalgae are cyanophyceae sp bacillariophyceae sp chlorophyceae sp and chrysophyceae sp 7 they use photosynthesis to transform inorganic carbon into biomass and consume nutrients like nitrate and phosphate 8 microalgae not only grow fast and have a short growth cycle but also contain a lot of organic matter including protein starch cellulose lipids etc 9 lipids proteins and carbohydrates are abundant in algal biomass which can be turned into biogas and bioethanol 10 microalgae can also be used to generate biochar 11 13 which can be used to treat wastewater microalgae can generate biomass through photosynthesis and certain microalgae can accumulate lipids as high as 50 or even 60 it can be used to digest nutrients and collect solar energy to develop biochemical substances and biofuels 10 14 16 as can be seen microalgae has a lot of potential as a liquid fuel alternative source material 17 20 the wastewater contains a large amount of nutrients required for microalgae growth studies have shown that algae is a good solution for wastewater biological treatment 21 23 microalgae have many advantages over other traditional wastewater treatment fig 1 for example low energy demand low cost effectiveness nutrient cycling less sludge formation greenhouse gas suppression recovery of nutrients in the form of useful biomass and other advantages 24 microalgae are now used to treat industrial wastewater 25 27 brewing wastewater municipal wastewater 28 pharmaceutical wastewater dairy wastewater food wastewater 29 and so on microalgae have a variety of positive functions in wastewater purification and have received extensive attention in recent years therefore many researchers have done different summary work shams forruque ahmed et al 30 compared conventional treatment systems with microalgae treatment systems chicheng yan et al 31 reviewed the use of various microalgae in the removal of heavy metals by describing the mechanism of heavy metal biosorption produced by microalgae chaofan zhang et al 32 reviewed the research progress on the removal of nutrients by microalgae bacteria complex and their interactions sook sin chan et al 33 reviewed the mechanism of microalgae bacteria symbiosis system these articles described the details of microalgae treatment technology in a certain part but did not systematically review the previous applications of microalgae in wastewater treatment this paper reviews the treatment of wastewater by indigenous microalgae and the combined treatment of wastewater by microalgae and other substances such as microalgae yeast system microalgae bacteria system microalgae constructed wetland system microalgae sludge system and so on in this paper these systems are summarized and analyzed rationally and the existing problems and the future and challenges of microalgae in wastewater treatment are put forward finally the characteristics advantages and disadvantages of different treatment technologies are described which will help to select reasonable treatment methods in different environments which will provide useful information for wastewater treatment 2 indigenous microalgae are used to treat wastewater 2 1 microalgae for the treatment of n and p phosphorus and nitrogen are released in significant quantities by humans in the form of agricultural fertilizer waste and wastewater which will accelerate the eutrophication of water body so it is imperative to treat nitrogen and phosphorus in wastewater 34 algal biomass is a viable approach for recovering nutrients from wastewater because algal species have a very effective nutrient absorption mechanism 35 36 many studies have been conducted on the use of microalgae to remediate nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers table 1 the study of li 37 shows that the removal rates of ammonia nitrogen and total phosphorus in black and odorous water treated by spirulina can reach 100 su 38 experiment shows that the removal rates of n and p in food industry wastewater by chlorella vulgaris and scenedesmus obliquus are 54 shi jing et al 39 constructed a double layer photobioreactor prototype which will not be affected by the loss of suspended solids bacteria or algae biomass in the leaching process the result is that the concentration of n and p in the wastewater can be effectively reduced by 70 99 fatima zahra mennaa et al 40 studied the treatment of seven kinds of microalgae in municipal wastewater and found that the removal capacity of microalgae to total dissolved phosphorus and nitrogen concentration was 80 and 87 respectively william michelon and his colleagues 41 employed microalgae to remove diluted swine effluent and the findings revealed that ammonia nitrogen and phosphate removal rates reached 100 in 7 and 11 days respectively in addition to a single species of microalgae to treat wastewater wang et al 42 investigated the combined treatment of fisheries effluent by two microalgae species thalassiosira pseudonana and isochrysis the results show that under the appropriate inoculation amount and volume ratio the joint treatment of wastewater by two kinds of microalgae can also achieve high removal efficiency the efficiency of wastewater treatment by microalgae with different nitrogen sources is also different wang xuechun 43 inoculated five kinds of common green algae in simulated wastewater with ammonia nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen as nitrogen sources respectively it was found that under the same nitrogen source as nutrient source there were differences in growth and pollutant removal characteristics among different algae species compared with the performance of microalgae in nitrate wastewater microalgae in ammonia nitrogen wastewater have a slow development rate and limited pollutant removal effectiveness which may be due to the decrease of ph value caused by the release of h in the process of microalgae metabolizing ammonia nitrogen which inhibits the activity of microalgae 2 2 microalgae can reduce bod and cod in wastewater for certain types of wastewater microalgae have a certain purifying effectiveness 44 table 2 maría fernanda soto et al 45 using chlorella vulgaris to treat sugarcane alcohol distillation wastewater it was found that cod and bod decreased by 49 and 70 respectively in order to balance the factors limiting the growth of microalgae in a single food processing wastewater sun chenlu 46 tried to mix two kinds of food wastewater with different acidity and alkalinity and different organic matter content it was found that the removal rates of total nitrogen ammonia nitrogen total phosphorus and cod by chlorella were 72 75 65 97 94 3 and 62 75 respectively the removal efficiency of different kinds of microalgae to the same kind of wastewater is also different chandra et al 47 used different kinds of microalgae to treat dairy wastewater the results show that chlorella minutissima and scenedesmus abundans can remove bod and cod by 70 and 56 respectively while nostoc muscorum and spirulina sp have no obvious removal of bod and cod and the removal efficiency is only 38 and 24 respectively microalgae can reduce bod and cod in wastewater in two different ways first wastewater contains both organic and inorganic materials that microalgae can use simultaneously while utilizing light energy 48 second the growth of microalgae releases oxygen through photosynthesis so as to reduce the oxygen demand of water and achieve the purpose of reducing bod and cod 49 2 3 microalgae are used to treat contaminants of emerging concern contaminants of emerging concern cecs are chemicals or materials present in trace amounts in the environment that provide an actual or prospective concern to the environment human and animal health 52 some studies have shown that some species of microalgae have high survival rates due to their harmful effects on cecs 53 54 microalgae remove cecs by biosorption 55 bioaccumulation 56 57 and biodegradation 58 for diazinon insecticide 53 sulfamethazine 59 ciprofloxacin 60 61 and other chemicals experiments on the elimination of cecs by microalgae have yielded positive results 62 for example jie chi 63 and his colleagues studied the effects of three species of marine microalgae on the degradation of diethyl phthalate dep and dibutyl phthalate dbp pollutants the results showed that phthalate pollution in the marine environment could be mitigated by the presence of marine microalgae and cydrotheca closterium was found to be the most effective species for phthalate degradation sulfamethylpyrimidine is considered as one of the main emerging micro pollutants due to its long term existence in the environmental system 64 chen 65 found that chlorella vulgaris and scenedesmus obliquus removed sulfamethazine through biodegradation including ring clearance hydrogenation methylation and oxidation the results showed that the removal rates reached 52 and 43 3 after 15 days vassalle et al 66 achieved 84 91 estradiol removal in an upflow anaerobic sludge bed reactor and 95 estrone removal in a high rate algae pond system the elimination of cecs by microalgae however is not universal microalgae chlorella sp for example have been proven to be successful at removing ibuprofen and caffeine but not carbamazepine or tris 2 chloroethyl phosphate both of which are difficult to breakdown 67 2 4 microalgae are used to treat heavy metals heavy metal pollution poses a global hazard to ecosystems heavy metal toxicity and carcinogenicity such as mercury cadmium lead and arsenic have a negative impact on ecological variety and constitute a major threat to human life in previous studies 31 68 microalgae have been proved to be used to control heavy metal pollution table 3 wang meichen 69 used four kinds of algae to treat fe and mn heavy metals in shallow groundwater in mining area and microcystis aeruginosa had the best removal effect on fe and mn in water through the study m aeruginosa removes heavy metals from groundwater through cation exchange and the adsorption of heavy metals by algae microalgae also respond to heavy metal toxicity by regulating the gene expression of some proteins transporters involved in uptake sequestration and detoxification 70 or by releasing organic ligands on the cell surface such as glutamic acid trehalose and phytochelatins or by producing extracellular polysaccharides to prevent extracellular adsorption 71 under lead stress saturated fatty acids and monounsaturated fatty acids dominate therefore microalgae can also be used in the bioremediation of lead polluted wastewater while producing biofuels 72 microalgae can also remove heavy metal chromium husien et al 73 used chlorella sorokiniana to remove cr the research shows that under the condition of 100 ppm cr vi the chromium removal rate reaches 99 6793 after 3 days of contact hedayatkhah et al 74 tested the bioremediation ability of two microalgae to dichromate at an intensity of light 55 μmol m 2 s 1 optimal dichromate elimination and lipid formation were attained for both strains microalgae have varied degrees of ability to bio transform acid reducible hg2 into elemental hg0 and metacinnabar 75 in addition microalgae also have significant removal efficiency for arsenic in wastewater the research results of singh et al 76 showed that the accumulation of arsenic in microalgae reached 760 μg g in as contaminated areas hydrodictiyon reticulatom and oscillatoria sp were discovered indicating potential for arsenic bioremediation arora uses four microalgae to remove arsenic from synthetic soft water the results show that chlorella minutissima and scenedesmus sp iitrind2 can withstand up to 500 mg l arsenic and can remove up to 161 μg g of arsenic 77 in addition to directly removing arsenic from wastewater microalgae can also improve the toxicity of plants rice by reducing the absorption and regulation of antioxidant enzymes so as to improve the tolerance of plants to arsenic 78 the responses of microalgae strains to cadmium stress were different cd ii functions as a defensive mechanism by increasing the formation of plant chelatin superoxide dismutase catalase and peroxidase in addition to lowering cell development and chlorophyll concentration 79 80 zhixin wang et al 81 showed that active microalgae didymogenes palatina xr could effectively treat water polluted by low concentration 2 mg l cd with a maximum removal rate of 87 99 at the same time it was discovered that microalgae were sensitive to low levels of the heavy metal cd and that varied phosphorus culture concentrations could control the surface phosphorus load of microalgae and improve their cd ii adsorption ability some scholars 82 studied the effect of desmodesmus sp chx1 on the removal of cu ii in the digestive juice of piggery the analysis indicate that ph 6 00 was the optimal setting for desmodesmus sp chx1 to remove cu ii the concentration of microalgae was 0 41 g l the treatment time was 4 days and the copper removal efficiency was 88 35 they believe that that the main mechanism of copper removal by desmodesmus sp chx1 is the affinity of functional groups in microalgae cell walls for cu ii according to the study microalgae have the capability of absorbing inorganic selenium and combine it into amino acids to form selenium amino acids jun li et al 50 studied that microalgae were cultured in selenium rich wastewater and found that the average removal rates of nh4 n tp and cod were 93 77 and 70 respectively more importantly the recovery rate of selenium reached 43 selenium enriched microalgae can be used as high value feed supplements which can not only remove wastewater but also support the development of circular economy 3 treatment on wastewater by coupled system of algal pond and constructed wetlands constructed wetlands have been successful for their modest footprint minimal construction cost and simplicity of maintenance for the treatment of various pollutants including nitrogenous compounds 84 86 however due to the poor reoxygenation effect of the traditional constructed wetland system the wetland system is in a state of hypoxia or anaerobic for a long time which limits the nitrification resulting in poor nitrogen removal efficiency in the remediation of domestic municipal wastewater the content of carbon source needed for denitrification is low microalgae could thrive in wastewater and use efficient photosynthesis to enhance do levels 87 88 microalgae can live in wastewater and use photosynthesis to raise the concentration of dissolved oxygen microalgae can also produce new organic matter which reduces operating costs 89 algae pond and constructed wetlands are combined to form an economic and effective wastewater treatment system fig 2 zhao xin 90 combined algae ponds and constructed wetlands to treat urban wastewater the introduction of microalgae can improve the aerobic and anaerobic environment in the wetland the coupling system of algal pond and constructed wetland showed a good effect of pollutant removal with the elimination rates of cod nh4 n tn and tp reaching 85 04 87 26 97 79 98 38 33 31 57 74 and 39 60 58 57 respectively 90 the research results of ding et al 91 show that the combination of high efficiency algae ponds and constructed wetlands can improve the concentration of do and cod in wetlands and improve the removal efficiency of tn in the mixed system the greatest removal rates of nh4 n and tn are 67 2 and 63 5 respectively significantly higher than those in a single constructed wetland system although this method improves the removal efficiency it is easy to cause system blockage when a large number of algae cells enter the constructed wetland system 4 treatment of wastewater by co culture of microalgae and microorganisms 4 1 treatment of wastewater by co culture of microalgae and fungi because filamentous fungi can immobilize microalgae through mycelial contact co cultivating algae and filamentous fungi is a new way for harvesting microalgae efficiently 92 the biomass of the fungus microalgae mixed culture was substantially higher than that of the pure culture according to the findings 93 extracellular enzymes secreted by fungi can transform solid organic materials into soluble nutrients and carbon dioxide allowing microalgae cells to be absorbed more easily 94 95 on the contrary microalgae cells give out oxygen to promote fungal respiration weixing cao et al 96 found that chlorella vulgaris and ganoderma lucidum have the highest efficiency in biogas slurry treatment and the removal rates of cod tn and tp are 78 09 86 24 and 86 74 respectively the co culture of fungal hyphae and microalgae is a complex process due to electrostatic neutralization 97 interaction of surface proteins 98 and adhesion of extracellular polysaccharides 99 fungal hyphae can adhere to microalgae and achieve co spheroidization of microalgae and fungi 100 wang et al 101 discovered that the fungus microalgae symbiotic system had a significantly higher amount of total extracellular polysaccharides than the fungi and microalgae control group it plays an important role in dealing with heavy metal stress and resisting heavy metal toxicity to accumulate biomass the fungus microalgae symbiotic system offers the benefits of a large specific surface area good mechanical stability and a high mass transfer rate 102 the cell particles are relatively large and the microalgae can be collected through a sieve thus reducing the collection cost the ratio of microalgae to fungi has a certain effect on the harvest of microalgae biomass the results of gultom 93 showed that when the ratio of fungi aspergillus niger to microalgae chlorella vulgaris was 1 300 the harvest efficiency of microalgae was the highest 90 at present the treatment of wastewater by fungal microalgae system is still in the laboratory stage however the factory wastewater also contains many wild types of microorganisms which will pose a threat to the system in addition the element nutrition is also different in different wastewater environment and the fungal microalgae system is a challenge to the change of nutrient load in the environment 4 2 treatment of wastewater by co culture of microalgae and yeast yeast is widely used in brewing baking and pharmaceutical industries yeast has good sedimentation and dehydration characteristics and can remove biomass economically and effectively 103 a study by lim kim and hwang 104 found that yeast could decrease the cod of industrial effluent by 70 within 6 3 h previous studies have known that yeast alone is highly efficient in wastewater treatment recently some scholars 105 used microalgae and yeast co culture to treat wastewater and found that the co culture of microalgae and yeast obtained high nutrient removal efficiency 96 nitrate 100 total ammonia nitrogen tan and 93 orthophosphate but at the same time the production of microalgae and yeast was very low which they thought was due to the fluctuation of ph the advantage of co culture of yeast and microalgae is that the oxygen produced by microalgae can be absorbed by yeast as carbon substrate which then releases carbon dioxide that promotes the photosynthesis of microalgae the culture mode of yeast and microalgae also has a certain influence luo zhizhan 106 divided microalgae into fixed and non fixed modes and co cultured with rhodosporidium sp to treat shrimp culture wastewater the findings revealed showed that the co culture system of suspension yeast and chlorella sp had the highest removal rate of nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients and the removal rates of nh4 no2 no3 and po4 3 were 85 47 100 96 09 and 93 38 respectively although the microalgae yeast system has a high level of nutrient removal the output of microalgae and yeast is quite poor due to the ph fluctuations there are few studies on microalgae yeast system for wastewater treatment and there are still many contents worthy of our exploration 4 3 treatment of wastewater by co culture of microalgae and bacteria microalgae can alleviate some of the problems in the treatment process based on bacteria and fungi so more and more people try to co culture microalgae and bacteria to treat wastewater 107 108 table 4 some scholars have found that microalgae bacterial complex can tolerate chlortetracycline up to 80 mg l while pure microalgae culture can only tolerate chlortetracycline of 60 mg l 109 it is self evident that developing a symbiotic interaction between microalgae and bacteria will result in improved wastewater treatment performance 32 wang et al 110 showed that compared with traditional ponds the addition of bacteria microalgae could reduce the concentration of tn tan and nitrite by 17 29 29 69 and 15 92 respectively by examining the treatment of pig wastewater by bacteria algae symbiosis system of chlorella sp ma1 and coelastrella sp ke4 symbiosis wenying qu et al 111 discovered that the removal efficiency of nh4 n and po4 3 p increased from 12 79 to 99 52 and 35 66 to 96 06 respectively at present the interaction mechanisms between microalgae and bacteria mainly include nutrient exchange 112 intercellular communication 113 compound stimulation 114 and so on bacteria oxidize organic substances to inorganic forms such as nh4 n and no3 n is used and consumed by microalgae and the oxygen produced by microalgae is used by bacteria 115 different bacteria will show various benefits of further promoting the production of bioenergy by microalgae from the aspects of promoting growth accumulating components economic harvest and effective extraction in general through the stimulation of bacteria the growth rate of microalgae can be boosted by 10 to 70 resulting in a large increase in bioenergy productivity 112 dan li et al 116 discovered that co culture of microalgae and bacteria enhanced the proportion of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids within microalgae and that the fatty acid profile of microalgae bacterium co culture was superior for biofuel generation than that of aseptic oblique spore cultivation in practical wastewater such as fishery wastewater there will be a lot of feed residues which can be well treated by microalgae and bacteria system complex organic matter can be reduced into simple molecules that microalgae can utilize during the anaerobic acidification process zhang et al 117 explored the combination of acid producing fermentation and microalgae culture to treat wastewater the findings revealed that the efficiency of the removal of cod and nh4 n in acid production solution reached 94 4 and 68 8 respectively plant organic matter will be liberated in the process of biological adsorption of heavy metals such as cod will increase this secondary pollution of water quality can be treated by co culture of microalgae and endophytes isolated from hyperaccumulators some studies have shown that when using water hyacinth as a plant derived biosorbent to remove cd ii in wastewater and then co cultured with microalgae and endophytes the cod produced by water hyacinth can be effectively removed and cd ii can be effectively removed the removal rate is increased to 99 2 118 what s more endophytes can help host plants produce more biomass by nitrogen fixation phosphorus enhancement iron carrier and indoleacetic acid production 119 it can also boost mineral nutrient absorption or host plant resistance or tolerance to biotic and abiotic stressors hence promoting host plant growth and health and lowering the cost of nutrition addition which reduces the cost of nutrition addition if it is applied to industrial wastewater treatment it is worth noting that the microalgae and bacteria of this system need to be strictly screened and the key to improving the system s removal efficiency is to choose the best combination of bacteria and algae in addition when the concentration of phenols and other organic pollutants in wastewater is too high it can inhibit the microbial degradation bacteria and reduce the removal efficiency therefore the wastewater needs to be further pretreated 5 treatment on wastewater by microalgae sludge symbiotic system to collect lipids algae can utilise a range of organic substrates as carbon and energy sources anaerobic sludge microalgae co culture system has higher substrate conversion efficiency and energy conversion efficiency acetate and butyrate are the main soluble metabolites produced during dark fermentation with co culture consuming the majority of them fig 3 hong yu ren et al 121 when using wastewater from sweet potato starch as substrate the highest removal rate and energy conversion efficiency of cod tn and tp reached 80 5 88 7 80 1 and 34 2 respectively starch wastewater is an effective raw material for anaerobic fermentation which contains not only high starch but also n p and other nutrients and the co culture of algae and anaerobic sludge is a new method to absorb soluble metabolites for cell growth and lipid production which can save energy in addition to anaerobic sludge activated sludge has made a great contribution to the protection of human health and water quality 122 but the activated sludge process can directly or indirectly emit three greenhouse gases 123 co2 n2o and ch4 co culture of sludge and microalgae can solve this problem microalgae produce oxygen during photosynthesis which can raise dissolved oxygen levels reducing the generation of n2o and ch4 secondly microalgae can also absorb nitrogen studies 124 have shown that the removal rates of cod tn and tp can reach 95 in the wastewater treated by microalgae sludge co culture with or without light the results of ghulam mujtaba 48 show that nitrogen phosphorus and carbon can be removed simultaneously in a short time only two days by co culture of immobilized chlorella vulgaris and suspended activated sludge at the same time it was also found that the amount of inoculation had little effect on the removal of cod but when the amount of inoculation was 0 5 the maximum growth of microalgae 0 76 g l reached the maximum indicating that the appropriate amount of inoculation was of great significance maria sole bund ó and his colleagues 125 studied at how varied microalgae activated sludge ratios affected nutrients organic matter removal and biomass production the results reveal that when the ratio of microalgae to activated sludge is 3 1 it is possible to remove organic matter nutrients while simultaneously producing biomass in wastewater with low cod n this condition has a good removal effect on tn 86 tp 79 and cod 99 su et al 126 improves wastewater treatment by combining microalgae with activated sludge in a synergistic connection reducing tn and tp by 91 and 93 5 respectively when the algal sludge ratio is 5 1 in the co culture system of microalgae and activated sludge microalgae play a key role in nutrient assimilation and activated sludge plays a key role in tn assimilation denitrification and cod removal it is worth noting that high activated sludge concentration may not be conducive to the growth of microalgae because when the sludge concentration is too high light attenuation will inhibit the growth of algae 122 6 co treatment of microalgae and other carriers because of its tiny size 3 30 μm low concentration and stable surface charge the microalgae were stably suspended in the culture solution it is not easy to transport and the cost in the harvest process is also high and the microalgae immobilization technology can solve this problem this technique is done by forming a thin microalgae film on the solid surface and fixing it 127 fig 4 a new study found that chlorella vulgaris and scenedesmus vacuolans microalgae biofilms could entirely remove phosphate from synthetic wastewater after 1 and 2 days which were 4 mg l and 6 5 mg l respectively 128 some scholars found that after using microalgae biofilm to repair kaduna river water the high concentration of o2 and h2o2 produced by microalgae was closely related to the degradation of pollutants gc ms analysis of microalgae biofilm showed that some phytochemicals were involved in the process of pollutant degradation in addition it was also found that the surface morphology of the treated biofilm was rough which indicated that the biofilm could remove pollutants from the water by biosorption 129 patricia k akao 130 and his colleagues dipped the standard polyether sponge into the original waste liquid sample to form a biofilm on the sponge this treatment increases the removal rates of bod ammonia nitrogen and phosphate to 80 64 and 95 respectively within 7 days chun yen chen 131 also used polyurethane sponge as carrier and microalgae culture to treat pig wastewater the results showed that cod 600 mg l bod 80 mg l which met the local pig farm wastewater discharge standard ji et al 132 activated roasted shellfish powder cmsp by k2co3 k cmsp modified the porous surface of k cmsp with l arginine made the porous biomass surface positively charged and creatively used it as a carrier to adsorb immobilized microalgae by electrostatic interaction from this experiment it was concluded that the removal rates of n and p were the highest at 25 c 95 0 and 88 63 respectively when compared to the non biofortified treatment the concentrations of total nitrogen total ammonia nitrogen and nitrite nitrogen in the bacteria microalgae group with biofilm carriers dropped by 29 15 51 28 and 33 48 respectively while the fish yield significantly increased by 13 3 110 the membrane can prevent the biomass from escaping from the reactor and increase the biomass concentration which can be seen that the effluent quality is significantly improved in addition to membrane carriers johnson and win 133 studied chlorella sp compared with cardboard polyethylene fabric and towel gourd sponge high biomass and high fatty acid yield of 25 65 g m2 d and 2 31 g m2 d were obtained by cultivating and producing biofuel in cow manure wastewater and stirring on shaker compared with cardboard polyethylene fabric and towel gourd sponge high biomass and high fatty acid yield were obtained in addition to microalgae and membrane carrier technology nano biotic hybrid technology has emerged for wastewater treatment in recent years the study of wahid et al 134 showed that the multilayer graphene algae mixture was more effective in removing nitrate than primitive microalgae cells there is also a combination of microalgae and zinc oxide nanomaterials to treat wastewater zno nps has high adsorption characteristics due to its high surface energy which contributes to the formation of stable hybrid materials with surrounding cells 135 because of its outstanding biocompatibility low cost and low toxicity zno nps has become one of the most preferred metal oxide nanoparticles although zno nps has obvious cytotoxicity to microalgae studies have shown 136 cytotoxicity tests have confirmed that lower concentration 10 mg l of zno nps has no toxic effect on microalgae cells and contributes to cell proliferation when microalgae and zinc oxide nanomaterials are used to treat wastewater the combination of mas04 zno nps can better remove nutrients from wastewater both membrane carrier technology and nano mixing technology are to fix the suspended microalgae obviously this advantage lies in enhancing the removal efficiency of wastewater and secondly it is easy to separate microalgae biomass from the treatment wastewater to reduce the recovery cost furthermore research have revealed that immobilized microalgae in wastewater treatment have a great tolerance to harmful chemicals 137 the immobilized material also needs to increase the area that can be attached to microalgae in addition the high cost of carrier materials is a limiting factor when treating a large amount of wastewater the cleaning and repeated use of the carrier need to be further explored therefore finding a kind of fixed material with high feasibility is the most important research goal 7 perspective there are still many aspects of microalgae treatment of wastewater that need to be further explored the most significant impediment to large scale commercialization of microalgae technology is its economic feasibility at present there are many potential microalgae that have not been used for water pollution treatment and finding suitable and efficient microalgae is the key as for the selection of wastewater types single wastewater is mainly used now and few researchers have studied mixed wastewater the content of certain elements in a single waste water may be particularly high which may affect the growth of microalgae and even lead to serious death if various types of waste water can be neutralized the neutralization of the content in the wastewater may be beneficial to the growth of microalgae it can be developed in this direction in future research in the process of cultivating microalgae in wastewater a huge amount of strange odor will be produced with the increase of culture time microalgae will adhere to the device wall limiting the light to affect the photosynthesis of algae cells we need to find a way to solve the peculiar smell and adhesion of algal cells different microalgae have different effects under different conditions so it is critical to optimize growth conditions that are simple to regulate and increase production efficiency large scale industrialization has not been realized due to high operational costs energy intensive operations and low biomass productivity among other factors this is due to the fact that the current microalgae culture system uses either an open pond or a closed photobioreactor in which the microalgae biomass is maintained in liquid suspension although the effect of suspended microalgae in wastewater treatment is good how to collect clean water without microalgae needs to be further studied at present there are mainly physical electrical chemical and biological methods for the recovery of microalgae biomass each method has its own set of benefits and drawbacks the current tendency is to identify natural non chemical and effective materials to harvest microalgae in order to assure the recovery of high quality microalgae biomass 8 conclusion the nutrients organics contaminants of emerging concern and heavy metals in wastewater treated by microalgae were reviewed in this paper furthermore the advancement of microalgae coculture research in wastewater treatment was reviewed algae pond and engineered wetland coupling systems microalgae and various microorganisms systems microalgae and other carrier systems microalgae and sludge co culture systems and so on microalgae have broad application prospects in wastewater treatment it can effectively treat wastewater solve environmental problems and produce valuable by products however there are still many aspects of microalgae wastewater treatment that need additional investigation and exploration by more researchers for example how to remove the odor generated in the treatment of wastewater what kind of microalgae should be selected for different wastewater scenarios and how to collect clean water without microalgae in conclusion after solving these problems microalgae will be an efficient low cost and low energy method used to treat wastewater abbreviations cod chemical oxygen demand bod biochemical

12857,microalgae have become an important means of wastewater treatment as a sustainable and economical method of wastewater treatment microalgae not only purify wastewater from different sources but also use wastewater as growth matrix to produce valuable biological products biomaterials and bioenergy however given the complexity of compounds in wastewater and the challenge of increasing removal efficiency at a lower cost through treatment technology optimization more research is required in this paper the application of indigenous microalgae in wastewater treatment was analyzed and the wastewater was divided into four parts nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus chemical oxygen demand cod and biological oxygen demand bod contaminants of emerging concern and heavy metals in addition the joint treatment of wastewater by microalgae and other methods such as microalgae yeast system microalgae bacteria system microalgae constructed wetland system and microalgae sludge system were also discussed finally the immobilization technology of microalgae and the future development trend and challenges of microalgae in the treatment of water pollution are analyzed this will provide useful information for wastewater treatment graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords microalgae water pollution wastewater treatment co culture treatment data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction water is a resource for human survival however with the continuous development of society and the increasing water consumption a large amount of wastewater has been produced in the use of water resources such as industrial wastewater food wastewater domestic wastewater etc wastewater contains a lot of nutrient elements such as nitrogen and phosphorus heavy metals such as lead contaminants of emerging concern according to the data of china s national bureau of statistics 1 in 2020 total nitrogen emissions and total phosphorus emissions reached 3 223 400 tons and 336 700 tons respectively the cod emission in 2020 is five times that in 2019 reaching 25 6476 million tons the total emission of heavy metals such as lead reached 26 680 kg if the wastewater is discharged into the wastewater without treatment these pollutants in the wastewater will not only threaten aquatic organisms but also endanger human health 2 at present the main treatment methods of wastewater pollution are physical method screening filtration sedimentation filtration membrane chemical method chemical precipitation adsorption electrochemical treatment ion exchange 3 biological method biosorption bioprecipitation 4 the advantages of these methods are to remove substances in different wastewater and use different methods to remove pollutants for example filtration method can filter large and small particles and ion exchange method can remove heavy metals in wastewater these treatment technologies also have some disadvantages such as uneven removal efficiency high installation cost and uneconomical which may cause secondary pollution and increase the difficulty of subsequent treatment 5 algae is a single celled organism composed of prokaryotes and eukaryotes algae can be divided into macroalgae and microalgae microalgae are tiny groups of algae that can only be identified under a microscope so far 15 7 104 species of microalgae have been recognized with many more yet to be discovered 6 the principal groups of microalgae are cyanophyceae sp bacillariophyceae sp chlorophyceae sp and chrysophyceae sp 7 they use photosynthesis to transform inorganic carbon into biomass and consume nutrients like nitrate and phosphate 8 microalgae not only grow fast and have a short growth cycle but also contain a lot of organic matter including protein starch cellulose lipids etc 9 lipids proteins and carbohydrates are abundant in algal biomass which can be turned into biogas and bioethanol 10 microalgae can also be used to generate biochar 11 13 which can be used to treat wastewater microalgae can generate biomass through photosynthesis and certain microalgae can accumulate lipids as high as 50 or even 60 it can be used to digest nutrients and collect solar energy to develop biochemical substances and biofuels 10 14 16 as can be seen microalgae has a lot of potential as a liquid fuel alternative source material 17 20 the wastewater contains a large amount of nutrients required for microalgae growth studies have shown that algae is a good solution for wastewater biological treatment 21 23 microalgae have many advantages over other traditional wastewater treatment fig 1 for example low energy demand low cost effectiveness nutrient cycling less sludge formation greenhouse gas suppression recovery of nutrients in the form of useful biomass and other advantages 24 microalgae are now used to treat industrial wastewater 25 27 brewing wastewater municipal wastewater 28 pharmaceutical wastewater dairy wastewater food wastewater 29 and so on microalgae have a variety of positive functions in wastewater purification and have received extensive attention in recent years therefore many researchers have done different summary work shams forruque ahmed et al 30 compared conventional treatment systems with microalgae treatment systems chicheng yan et al 31 reviewed the use of various microalgae in the removal of heavy metals by describing the mechanism of heavy metal biosorption produced by microalgae chaofan zhang et al 32 reviewed the research progress on the removal of nutrients by microalgae bacteria complex and their interactions sook sin chan et al 33 reviewed the mechanism of microalgae bacteria symbiosis system these articles described the details of microalgae treatment technology in a certain part but did not systematically review the previous applications of microalgae in wastewater treatment this paper reviews the treatment of wastewater by indigenous microalgae and the combined treatment of wastewater by microalgae and other substances such as microalgae yeast system microalgae bacteria system microalgae constructed wetland system microalgae sludge system and so on in this paper these systems are summarized and analyzed rationally and the existing problems and the future and challenges of microalgae in wastewater treatment are put forward finally the characteristics advantages and disadvantages of different treatment technologies are described which will help to select reasonable treatment methods in different environments which will provide useful information for wastewater treatment 2 indigenous microalgae are used to treat wastewater 2 1 microalgae for the treatment of n and p phosphorus and nitrogen are released in significant quantities by humans in the form of agricultural fertilizer waste and wastewater which will accelerate the eutrophication of water body so it is imperative to treat nitrogen and phosphorus in wastewater 34 algal biomass is a viable approach for recovering nutrients from wastewater because algal species have a very effective nutrient absorption mechanism 35 36 many studies have been conducted on the use of microalgae to remediate nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers table 1 the study of li 37 shows that the removal rates of ammonia nitrogen and total phosphorus in black and odorous water treated by spirulina can reach 100 su 38 experiment shows that the removal rates of n and p in food industry wastewater by chlorella vulgaris and scenedesmus obliquus are 54 shi jing et al 39 constructed a double layer photobioreactor prototype which will not be affected by the loss of suspended solids bacteria or algae biomass in the leaching process the result is that the concentration of n and p in the wastewater can be effectively reduced by 70 99 fatima zahra mennaa et al 40 studied the treatment of seven kinds of microalgae in municipal wastewater and found that the removal capacity of microalgae to total dissolved phosphorus and nitrogen concentration was 80 and 87 respectively william michelon and his colleagues 41 employed microalgae to remove diluted swine effluent and the findings revealed that ammonia nitrogen and phosphate removal rates reached 100 in 7 and 11 days respectively in addition to a single species of microalgae to treat wastewater wang et al 42 investigated the combined treatment of fisheries effluent by two microalgae species thalassiosira pseudonana and isochrysis the results show that under the appropriate inoculation amount and volume ratio the joint treatment of wastewater by two kinds of microalgae can also achieve high removal efficiency the efficiency of wastewater treatment by microalgae with different nitrogen sources is also different wang xuechun 43 inoculated five kinds of common green algae in simulated wastewater with ammonia nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen as nitrogen sources respectively it was found that under the same nitrogen source as nutrient source there were differences in growth and pollutant removal characteristics among different algae species compared with the performance of microalgae in nitrate wastewater microalgae in ammonia nitrogen wastewater have a slow development rate and limited pollutant removal effectiveness which may be due to the decrease of ph value caused by the release of h in the process of microalgae metabolizing ammonia nitrogen which inhibits the activity of microalgae 2 2 microalgae can reduce bod and cod in wastewater for certain types of wastewater microalgae have a certain purifying effectiveness 44 table 2 maría fernanda soto et al 45 using chlorella vulgaris to treat sugarcane alcohol distillation wastewater it was found that cod and bod decreased by 49 and 70 respectively in order to balance the factors limiting the growth of microalgae in a single food processing wastewater sun chenlu 46 tried to mix two kinds of food wastewater with different acidity and alkalinity and different organic matter content it was found that the removal rates of total nitrogen ammonia nitrogen total phosphorus and cod by chlorella were 72 75 65 97 94 3 and 62 75 respectively the removal efficiency of different kinds of microalgae to the same kind of wastewater is also different chandra et al 47 used different kinds of microalgae to treat dairy wastewater the results show that chlorella minutissima and scenedesmus abundans can remove bod and cod by 70 and 56 respectively while nostoc muscorum and spirulina sp have no obvious removal of bod and cod and the removal efficiency is only 38 and 24 respectively microalgae can reduce bod and cod in wastewater in two different ways first wastewater contains both organic and inorganic materials that microalgae can use simultaneously while utilizing light energy 48 second the growth of microalgae releases oxygen through photosynthesis so as to reduce the oxygen demand of water and achieve the purpose of reducing bod and cod 49 2 3 microalgae are used to treat contaminants of emerging concern contaminants of emerging concern cecs are chemicals or materials present in trace amounts in the environment that provide an actual or prospective concern to the environment human and animal health 52 some studies have shown that some species of microalgae have high survival rates due to their harmful effects on cecs 53 54 microalgae remove cecs by biosorption 55 bioaccumulation 56 57 and biodegradation 58 for diazinon insecticide 53 sulfamethazine 59 ciprofloxacin 60 61 and other chemicals experiments on the elimination of cecs by microalgae have yielded positive results 62 for example jie chi 63 and his colleagues studied the effects of three species of marine microalgae on the degradation of diethyl phthalate dep and dibutyl phthalate dbp pollutants the results showed that phthalate pollution in the marine environment could be mitigated by the presence of marine microalgae and cydrotheca closterium was found to be the most effective species for phthalate degradation sulfamethylpyrimidine is considered as one of the main emerging micro pollutants due to its long term existence in the environmental system 64 chen 65 found that chlorella vulgaris and scenedesmus obliquus removed sulfamethazine through biodegradation including ring clearance hydrogenation methylation and oxidation the results showed that the removal rates reached 52 and 43 3 after 15 days vassalle et al 66 achieved 84 91 estradiol removal in an upflow anaerobic sludge bed reactor and 95 estrone removal in a high rate algae pond system the elimination of cecs by microalgae however is not universal microalgae chlorella sp for example have been proven to be successful at removing ibuprofen and caffeine but not carbamazepine or tris 2 chloroethyl phosphate both of which are difficult to breakdown 67 2 4 microalgae are used to treat heavy metals heavy metal pollution poses a global hazard to ecosystems heavy metal toxicity and carcinogenicity such as mercury cadmium lead and arsenic have a negative impact on ecological variety and constitute a major threat to human life in previous studies 31 68 microalgae have been proved to be used to control heavy metal pollution table 3 wang meichen 69 used four kinds of algae to treat fe and mn heavy metals in shallow groundwater in mining area and microcystis aeruginosa had the best removal effect on fe and mn in water through the study m aeruginosa removes heavy metals from groundwater through cation exchange and the adsorption of heavy metals by algae microalgae also respond to heavy metal toxicity by regulating the gene expression of some proteins transporters involved in uptake sequestration and detoxification 70 or by releasing organic ligands on the cell surface such as glutamic acid trehalose and phytochelatins or by producing extracellular polysaccharides to prevent extracellular adsorption 71 under lead stress saturated fatty acids and monounsaturated fatty acids dominate therefore microalgae can also be used in the bioremediation of lead polluted wastewater while producing biofuels 72 microalgae can also remove heavy metal chromium husien et al 73 used chlorella sorokiniana to remove cr the research shows that under the condition of 100 ppm cr vi the chromium removal rate reaches 99 6793 after 3 days of contact hedayatkhah et al 74 tested the bioremediation ability of two microalgae to dichromate at an intensity of light 55 μmol m 2 s 1 optimal dichromate elimination and lipid formation were attained for both strains microalgae have varied degrees of ability to bio transform acid reducible hg2 into elemental hg0 and metacinnabar 75 in addition microalgae also have significant removal efficiency for arsenic in wastewater the research results of singh et al 76 showed that the accumulation of arsenic in microalgae reached 760 μg g in as contaminated areas hydrodictiyon reticulatom and oscillatoria sp were discovered indicating potential for arsenic bioremediation arora uses four microalgae to remove arsenic from synthetic soft water the results show that chlorella minutissima and scenedesmus sp iitrind2 can withstand up to 500 mg l arsenic and can remove up to 161 μg g of arsenic 77 in addition to directly removing arsenic from wastewater microalgae can also improve the toxicity of plants rice by reducing the absorption and regulation of antioxidant enzymes so as to improve the tolerance of plants to arsenic 78 the responses of microalgae strains to cadmium stress were different cd ii functions as a defensive mechanism by increasing the formation of plant chelatin superoxide dismutase catalase and peroxidase in addition to lowering cell development and chlorophyll concentration 79 80 zhixin wang et al 81 showed that active microalgae didymogenes palatina xr could effectively treat water polluted by low concentration 2 mg l cd with a maximum removal rate of 87 99 at the same time it was discovered that microalgae were sensitive to low levels of the heavy metal cd and that varied phosphorus culture concentrations could control the surface phosphorus load of microalgae and improve their cd ii adsorption ability some scholars 82 studied the effect of desmodesmus sp chx1 on the removal of cu ii in the digestive juice of piggery the analysis indicate that ph 6 00 was the optimal setting for desmodesmus sp chx1 to remove cu ii the concentration of microalgae was 0 41 g l the treatment time was 4 days and the copper removal efficiency was 88 35 they believe that that the main mechanism of copper removal by desmodesmus sp chx1 is the affinity of functional groups in microalgae cell walls for cu ii according to the study microalgae have the capability of absorbing inorganic selenium and combine it into amino acids to form selenium amino acids jun li et al 50 studied that microalgae were cultured in selenium rich wastewater and found that the average removal rates of nh4 n tp and cod were 93 77 and 70 respectively more importantly the recovery rate of selenium reached 43 selenium enriched microalgae can be used as high value feed supplements which can not only remove wastewater but also support the development of circular economy 3 treatment on wastewater by coupled system of algal pond and constructed wetlands constructed wetlands have been successful for their modest footprint minimal construction cost and simplicity of maintenance for the treatment of various pollutants including nitrogenous compounds 84 86 however due to the poor reoxygenation effect of the traditional constructed wetland system the wetland system is in a state of hypoxia or anaerobic for a long time which limits the nitrification resulting in poor nitrogen removal efficiency in the remediation of domestic municipal wastewater the content of carbon source needed for denitrification is low microalgae could thrive in wastewater and use efficient photosynthesis to enhance do levels 87 88 microalgae can live in wastewater and use photosynthesis to raise the concentration of dissolved oxygen microalgae can also produce new organic matter which reduces operating costs 89 algae pond and constructed wetlands are combined to form an economic and effective wastewater treatment system fig 2 zhao xin 90 combined algae ponds and constructed wetlands to treat urban wastewater the introduction of microalgae can improve the aerobic and anaerobic environment in the wetland the coupling system of algal pond and constructed wetland showed a good effect of pollutant removal with the elimination rates of cod nh4 n tn and tp reaching 85 04 87 26 97 79 98 38 33 31 57 74 and 39 60 58 57 respectively 90 the research results of ding et al 91 show that the combination of high efficiency algae ponds and constructed wetlands can improve the concentration of do and cod in wetlands and improve the removal efficiency of tn in the mixed system the greatest removal rates of nh4 n and tn are 67 2 and 63 5 respectively significantly higher than those in a single constructed wetland system although this method improves the removal efficiency it is easy to cause system blockage when a large number of algae cells enter the constructed wetland system 4 treatment of wastewater by co culture of microalgae and microorganisms 4 1 treatment of wastewater by co culture of microalgae and fungi because filamentous fungi can immobilize microalgae through mycelial contact co cultivating algae and filamentous fungi is a new way for harvesting microalgae efficiently 92 the biomass of the fungus microalgae mixed culture was substantially higher than that of the pure culture according to the findings 93 extracellular enzymes secreted by fungi can transform solid organic materials into soluble nutrients and carbon dioxide allowing microalgae cells to be absorbed more easily 94 95 on the contrary microalgae cells give out oxygen to promote fungal respiration weixing cao et al 96 found that chlorella vulgaris and ganoderma lucidum have the highest efficiency in biogas slurry treatment and the removal rates of cod tn and tp are 78 09 86 24 and 86 74 respectively the co culture of fungal hyphae and microalgae is a complex process due to electrostatic neutralization 97 interaction of surface proteins 98 and adhesion of extracellular polysaccharides 99 fungal hyphae can adhere to microalgae and achieve co spheroidization of microalgae and fungi 100 wang et al 101 discovered that the fungus microalgae symbiotic system had a significantly higher amount of total extracellular polysaccharides than the fungi and microalgae control group it plays an important role in dealing with heavy metal stress and resisting heavy metal toxicity to accumulate biomass the fungus microalgae symbiotic system offers the benefits of a large specific surface area good mechanical stability and a high mass transfer rate 102 the cell particles are relatively large and the microalgae can be collected through a sieve thus reducing the collection cost the ratio of microalgae to fungi has a certain effect on the harvest of microalgae biomass the results of gultom 93 showed that when the ratio of fungi aspergillus niger to microalgae chlorella vulgaris was 1 300 the harvest efficiency of microalgae was the highest 90 at present the treatment of wastewater by fungal microalgae system is still in the laboratory stage however the factory wastewater also contains many wild types of microorganisms which will pose a threat to the system in addition the element nutrition is also different in different wastewater environment and the fungal microalgae system is a challenge to the change of nutrient load in the environment 4 2 treatment of wastewater by co culture of microalgae and yeast yeast is widely used in brewing baking and pharmaceutical industries yeast has good sedimentation and dehydration characteristics and can remove biomass economically and effectively 103 a study by lim kim and hwang 104 found that yeast could decrease the cod of industrial effluent by 70 within 6 3 h previous studies have known that yeast alone is highly efficient in wastewater treatment recently some scholars 105 used microalgae and yeast co culture to treat wastewater and found that the co culture of microalgae and yeast obtained high nutrient removal efficiency 96 nitrate 100 total ammonia nitrogen tan and 93 orthophosphate but at the same time the production of microalgae and yeast was very low which they thought was due to the fluctuation of ph the advantage of co culture of yeast and microalgae is that the oxygen produced by microalgae can be absorbed by yeast as carbon substrate which then releases carbon dioxide that promotes the photosynthesis of microalgae the culture mode of yeast and microalgae also has a certain influence luo zhizhan 106 divided microalgae into fixed and non fixed modes and co cultured with rhodosporidium sp to treat shrimp culture wastewater the findings revealed showed that the co culture system of suspension yeast and chlorella sp had the highest removal rate of nitrogen and phosphorus nutrients and the removal rates of nh4 no2 no3 and po4 3 were 85 47 100 96 09 and 93 38 respectively although the microalgae yeast system has a high level of nutrient removal the output of microalgae and yeast is quite poor due to the ph fluctuations there are few studies on microalgae yeast system for wastewater treatment and there are still many contents worthy of our exploration 4 3 treatment of wastewater by co culture of microalgae and bacteria microalgae can alleviate some of the problems in the treatment process based on bacteria and fungi so more and more people try to co culture microalgae and bacteria to treat wastewater 107 108 table 4 some scholars have found that microalgae bacterial complex can tolerate chlortetracycline up to 80 mg l while pure microalgae culture can only tolerate chlortetracycline of 60 mg l 109 it is self evident that developing a symbiotic interaction between microalgae and bacteria will result in improved wastewater treatment performance 32 wang et al 110 showed that compared with traditional ponds the addition of bacteria microalgae could reduce the concentration of tn tan and nitrite by 17 29 29 69 and 15 92 respectively by examining the treatment of pig wastewater by bacteria algae symbiosis system of chlorella sp ma1 and coelastrella sp ke4 symbiosis wenying qu et al 111 discovered that the removal efficiency of nh4 n and po4 3 p increased from 12 79 to 99 52 and 35 66 to 96 06 respectively at present the interaction mechanisms between microalgae and bacteria mainly include nutrient exchange 112 intercellular communication 113 compound stimulation 114 and so on bacteria oxidize organic substances to inorganic forms such as nh4 n and no3 n is used and consumed by microalgae and the oxygen produced by microalgae is used by bacteria 115 different bacteria will show various benefits of further promoting the production of bioenergy by microalgae from the aspects of promoting growth accumulating components economic harvest and effective extraction in general through the stimulation of bacteria the growth rate of microalgae can be boosted by 10 to 70 resulting in a large increase in bioenergy productivity 112 dan li et al 116 discovered that co culture of microalgae and bacteria enhanced the proportion of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids within microalgae and that the fatty acid profile of microalgae bacterium co culture was superior for biofuel generation than that of aseptic oblique spore cultivation in practical wastewater such as fishery wastewater there will be a lot of feed residues which can be well treated by microalgae and bacteria system complex organic matter can be reduced into simple molecules that microalgae can utilize during the anaerobic acidification process zhang et al 117 explored the combination of acid producing fermentation and microalgae culture to treat wastewater the findings revealed that the efficiency of the removal of cod and nh4 n in acid production solution reached 94 4 and 68 8 respectively plant organic matter will be liberated in the process of biological adsorption of heavy metals such as cod will increase this secondary pollution of water quality can be treated by co culture of microalgae and endophytes isolated from hyperaccumulators some studies have shown that when using water hyacinth as a plant derived biosorbent to remove cd ii in wastewater and then co cultured with microalgae and endophytes the cod produced by water hyacinth can be effectively removed and cd ii can be effectively removed the removal rate is increased to 99 2 118 what s more endophytes can help host plants produce more biomass by nitrogen fixation phosphorus enhancement iron carrier and indoleacetic acid production 119 it can also boost mineral nutrient absorption or host plant resistance or tolerance to biotic and abiotic stressors hence promoting host plant growth and health and lowering the cost of nutrition addition which reduces the cost of nutrition addition if it is applied to industrial wastewater treatment it is worth noting that the microalgae and bacteria of this system need to be strictly screened and the key to improving the system s removal efficiency is to choose the best combination of bacteria and algae in addition when the concentration of phenols and other organic pollutants in wastewater is too high it can inhibit the microbial degradation bacteria and reduce the removal efficiency therefore the wastewater needs to be further pretreated 5 treatment on wastewater by microalgae sludge symbiotic system to collect lipids algae can utilise a range of organic substrates as carbon and energy sources anaerobic sludge microalgae co culture system has higher substrate conversion efficiency and energy conversion efficiency acetate and butyrate are the main soluble metabolites produced during dark fermentation with co culture consuming the majority of them fig 3 hong yu ren et al 121 when using wastewater from sweet potato starch as substrate the highest removal rate and energy conversion efficiency of cod tn and tp reached 80 5 88 7 80 1 and 34 2 respectively starch wastewater is an effective raw material for anaerobic fermentation which contains not only high starch but also n p and other nutrients and the co culture of algae and anaerobic sludge is a new method to absorb soluble metabolites for cell growth and lipid production which can save energy in addition to anaerobic sludge activated sludge has made a great contribution to the protection of human health and water quality 122 but the activated sludge process can directly or indirectly emit three greenhouse gases 123 co2 n2o and ch4 co culture of sludge and microalgae can solve this problem microalgae produce oxygen during photosynthesis which can raise dissolved oxygen levels reducing the generation of n2o and ch4 secondly microalgae can also absorb nitrogen studies 124 have shown that the removal rates of cod tn and tp can reach 95 in the wastewater treated by microalgae sludge co culture with or without light the results of ghulam mujtaba 48 show that nitrogen phosphorus and carbon can be removed simultaneously in a short time only two days by co culture of immobilized chlorella vulgaris and suspended activated sludge at the same time it was also found that the amount of inoculation had little effect on the removal of cod but when the amount of inoculation was 0 5 the maximum growth of microalgae 0 76 g l reached the maximum indicating that the appropriate amount of inoculation was of great significance maria sole bund ó and his colleagues 125 studied at how varied microalgae activated sludge ratios affected nutrients organic matter removal and biomass production the results reveal that when the ratio of microalgae to activated sludge is 3 1 it is possible to remove organic matter nutrients while simultaneously producing biomass in wastewater with low cod n this condition has a good removal effect on tn 86 tp 79 and cod 99 su et al 126 improves wastewater treatment by combining microalgae with activated sludge in a synergistic connection reducing tn and tp by 91 and 93 5 respectively when the algal sludge ratio is 5 1 in the co culture system of microalgae and activated sludge microalgae play a key role in nutrient assimilation and activated sludge plays a key role in tn assimilation denitrification and cod removal it is worth noting that high activated sludge concentration may not be conducive to the growth of microalgae because when the sludge concentration is too high light attenuation will inhibit the growth of algae 122 6 co treatment of microalgae and other carriers because of its tiny size 3 30 μm low concentration and stable surface charge the microalgae were stably suspended in the culture solution it is not easy to transport and the cost in the harvest process is also high and the microalgae immobilization technology can solve this problem this technique is done by forming a thin microalgae film on the solid surface and fixing it 127 fig 4 a new study found that chlorella vulgaris and scenedesmus vacuolans microalgae biofilms could entirely remove phosphate from synthetic wastewater after 1 and 2 days which were 4 mg l and 6 5 mg l respectively 128 some scholars found that after using microalgae biofilm to repair kaduna river water the high concentration of o2 and h2o2 produced by microalgae was closely related to the degradation of pollutants gc ms analysis of microalgae biofilm showed that some phytochemicals were involved in the process of pollutant degradation in addition it was also found that the surface morphology of the treated biofilm was rough which indicated that the biofilm could remove pollutants from the water by biosorption 129 patricia k akao 130 and his colleagues dipped the standard polyether sponge into the original waste liquid sample to form a biofilm on the sponge this treatment increases the removal rates of bod ammonia nitrogen and phosphate to 80 64 and 95 respectively within 7 days chun yen chen 131 also used polyurethane sponge as carrier and microalgae culture to treat pig wastewater the results showed that cod 600 mg l bod 80 mg l which met the local pig farm wastewater discharge standard ji et al 132 activated roasted shellfish powder cmsp by k2co3 k cmsp modified the porous surface of k cmsp with l arginine made the porous biomass surface positively charged and creatively used it as a carrier to adsorb immobilized microalgae by electrostatic interaction from this experiment it was concluded that the removal rates of n and p were the highest at 25 c 95 0 and 88 63 respectively when compared to the non biofortified treatment the concentrations of total nitrogen total ammonia nitrogen and nitrite nitrogen in the bacteria microalgae group with biofilm carriers dropped by 29 15 51 28 and 33 48 respectively while the fish yield significantly increased by 13 3 110 the membrane can prevent the biomass from escaping from the reactor and increase the biomass concentration which can be seen that the effluent quality is significantly improved in addition to membrane carriers johnson and win 133 studied chlorella sp compared with cardboard polyethylene fabric and towel gourd sponge high biomass and high fatty acid yield of 25 65 g m2 d and 2 31 g m2 d were obtained by cultivating and producing biofuel in cow manure wastewater and stirring on shaker compared with cardboard polyethylene fabric and towel gourd sponge high biomass and high fatty acid yield were obtained in addition to microalgae and membrane carrier technology nano biotic hybrid technology has emerged for wastewater treatment in recent years the study of wahid et al 134 showed that the multilayer graphene algae mixture was more effective in removing nitrate than primitive microalgae cells there is also a combination of microalgae and zinc oxide nanomaterials to treat wastewater zno nps has high adsorption characteristics due to its high surface energy which contributes to the formation of stable hybrid materials with surrounding cells 135 because of its outstanding biocompatibility low cost and low toxicity zno nps has become one of the most preferred metal oxide nanoparticles although zno nps has obvious cytotoxicity to microalgae studies have shown 136 cytotoxicity tests have confirmed that lower concentration 10 mg l of zno nps has no toxic effect on microalgae cells and contributes to cell proliferation when microalgae and zinc oxide nanomaterials are used to treat wastewater the combination of mas04 zno nps can better remove nutrients from wastewater both membrane carrier technology and nano mixing technology are to fix the suspended microalgae obviously this advantage lies in enhancing the removal efficiency of wastewater and secondly it is easy to separate microalgae biomass from the treatment wastewater to reduce the recovery cost furthermore research have revealed that immobilized microalgae in wastewater treatment have a great tolerance to harmful chemicals 137 the immobilized material also needs to increase the area that can be attached to microalgae in addition the high cost of carrier materials is a limiting factor when treating a large amount of wastewater the cleaning and repeated use of the carrier need to be further explored therefore finding a kind of fixed material with high feasibility is the most important research goal 7 perspective there are still many aspects of microalgae treatment of wastewater that need to be further explored the most significant impediment to large scale commercialization of microalgae technology is its economic feasibility at present there are many potential microalgae that have not been used for water pollution treatment and finding suitable and efficient microalgae is the key as for the selection of wastewater types single wastewater is mainly used now and few researchers have studied mixed wastewater the content of certain elements in a single waste water may be particularly high which may affect the growth of microalgae and even lead to serious death if various types of waste water can be neutralized the neutralization of the content in the wastewater may be beneficial to the growth of microalgae it can be developed in this direction in future research in the process of cultivating microalgae in wastewater a huge amount of strange odor will be produced with the increase of culture time microalgae will adhere to the device wall limiting the light to affect the photosynthesis of algae cells we need to find a way to solve the peculiar smell and adhesion of algal cells different microalgae have different effects under different conditions so it is critical to optimize growth conditions that are simple to regulate and increase production efficiency large scale industrialization has not been realized due to high operational costs energy intensive operations and low biomass productivity among other factors this is due to the fact that the current microalgae culture system uses either an open pond or a closed photobioreactor in which the microalgae biomass is maintained in liquid suspension although the effect of suspended microalgae in wastewater treatment is good how to collect clean water without microalgae needs to be further studied at present there are mainly physical electrical chemical and biological methods for the recovery of microalgae biomass each method has its own set of benefits and drawbacks the current tendency is to identify natural non chemical and effective materials to harvest microalgae in order to assure the recovery of high quality microalgae biomass 8 conclusion the nutrients organics contaminants of emerging concern and heavy metals in wastewater treated by microalgae were reviewed in this paper furthermore the advancement of microalgae coculture research in wastewater treatment was reviewed algae pond and engineered wetland coupling systems microalgae and various microorganisms systems microalgae and other carrier systems microalgae and sludge co culture systems and so on microalgae have broad application prospects in wastewater treatment it can effectively treat wastewater solve environmental problems and produce valuable by products however there are still many aspects of microalgae wastewater treatment that need additional investigation and exploration by more researchers for example how to remove the odor generated in the treatment of wastewater what kind of microalgae should be selected for different wastewater scenarios and how to collect clean water without microalgae in conclusion after solving these problems microalgae will be an efficient low cost and low energy method used to treat wastewater abbreviations cod chemical oxygen demand bod biochemical

12858,the promising sustainability and potential in carbon neutrality of the anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr integrated with partial nitritation anammox pn a was assessed using a large pilot scale plant the entire pilot scale system was conducted for a long term continuous operation of 217 days succeeding in the effective carbon neutral treatment of low strength real municipal wastewater with excellent cod removal efficiency of higher than 90 the major proportion of the organic matter was converted into bio methane which can be recovered as bio energy or bio fuel the residual ammonium contained in the digestate effluent of the anmbr was further treated by a pilot scale one stage pn a reactor the long term operation of the pilot scale anmbr was compared with the empirical assumption of the anaerobic anoxic oxic a2 o process exhibiting splendid feasibilities in both ecological and economical perspectives including energy conservation and recovery reduction of co2 emission and electricity expenditure saving for municipal wastewater treatment the application of anmbr pn a process helps reducing the energy consumption of 0 416 kwh m3 during the wastewater treatment process engineering of municipal wastewater accounting for 90 of that for the a2 o the anmbr pn a is also capable of reducing the co2 emission reduced by 74 9 a full scale wastewater treatment plant implemented with the anmbr pn a process could save the electricity expenditure by 0 80 million cny annually the results of this work are solid evidence that the anmbr pn a process is a remarkable sustainable technology also giving new insights into the concept of carbon neutral treatment of municipal wastewater in future studies keywords anaerobic digestion municipal wastewater anmbr carbon neutrality partial nitritation anammox data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction municipal wastewater characterized by low chemical oxygen demand cod concentration and high content of suspended solid ss is acknowledged as a source of low strength wastewater which is typically treated by the conventional activated sludge cas process 1 3 while the cas process has served as a widely adopted biological wastewater treatment process for decades this outdated technology is faced with such demerits like high consumption of electricity during the aeration progress and the expense for the disposal of wasted excessive sludge 4 6 with the growing concern over energy conservation and co2 reduction by the concept of carbon neutrality the cas is considered unsuitable for the current wastewater process engineering 7 8 fortunately the anaerobic digestion ad process has exhibited its sustainable advantages like high organic loading endurance low excessive sludge yield and bio energy recycle and is also likely to become an alternative to the cas process 9 14 however a formidable contradiction which limits the implementation of ad to municipal wastewater is that the process engineering for the daily treatment of huge quantities of wastewater requires short hydraulic retention times hrt along with short solids retention times srt 15 18 while both the hrt and srt should be long for the ad process in order to maintain the proliferation and degradation ability of anaerobic microorganisms 19 21 the anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr capable of decoupling hrt and srt currently considered as a reliable technology suitable for the carbon neutral treatment of municipal wastewater 22 26 the anmbr process also facilitates the enhancement of bio methane production and cod removal by retaining the anaerobic digested sludge and ss inside the digester under short hrts 12 17 27 29 while the organic matter could be effectively degraded by ad with the anmbr technology the carbon neutral removal of nitrogen one of the major inorganic pollutants is also a great concern for the treatment of the low strength municipal wastewater 30 32 the conventional biological nitrogen removal is consisted of nitrification and denitrification during which the ammonium nh4 is oxidized into nitrate no3 and then reduced to nitrogen gas n2 via a two phase process 2 33 35 this nitrogen removal process is typically combined with the upgraded activated sludge derivatives like the anaerobic oxic a o and anaerobic anoxic oxic a2 o process also sharing the drawbacks of the them high dissolved oxygen do supplied by the aeration for nitrification and extra supplement of carbon source to provide electron donor for denitrification 36 39 the partial nitritation anammox pn a an integrated process consisted of partial nitrification pn and the anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox has exhibited the promising feasibility in treating low strength ammonium containing wastewater 40 43 compared to the conventional nitrification denitrification process derived from the a o or a2 o the pn a process has been widely reported to have the remarkable abilities of significantly reducing aeration organic carbon source sludge yield and co2 emission 35 38 44 consequently for the removal of both organic and inorganic pollutants from municipal wastewater the anmbr process combined with pn a technology is more cost effective than the typical derivatives of the cas process due to their promising energy saving and low carbon advantages 27 31 45 46 therefore the integration of the anmbr with pn a is considered suitable to the carbon neutral treatment of municipal wastewater and has been demonstrated in some previous related studies influent cod is removed by the anmbr while the nh4 in the digestate is further removed by pn a 31 32 47 nevertheless most of the previous studies focused on anmbr and pn a simply used lab scale reactors which were fed by the synthetic municipal wastewater in their experiments 48 49 therefore in our previous studies a large pilot scale submerged anmbr integrated with one stage pn a reactor was constructed in a local wastewater treatment plant 5 45 the anmbr system succeeded in a long term anaerobic treatment of the real municipal wastewater by obtaining high cod removal and bio methane recovery with low sludge yield 45 and the pn a system also effectively removed the residual nh4 from the digestate of the anmbr 31 32 while the theoretical feasibility of the anmbr pn a technology has been clearly demonstrated a precise and practical assessment of the carbon neutral advantages of this process is considered essential and should be qualified by a large pilot scale plant for the real wastewater process engineering of municipal wastewater treatment 50 51 this study aims at revealing the energy saving and energy productive superiorities of the anmbr pn a process to the a2 o process a comparative evaluation between the anmbr pn a and a2 o should be made by investigating the co2 emission energy consumption production and also the expenditure during the long term treatment of real municipal wastewater the theoretical evaluation of energy consumption production co2 emission along with expenditure calculated following empirical equations on the basis of the operational results of the anmbr pn a the practical assessment of the feasibility in waster process engineering was estimated by assuming the process is implemented in a real wastewater treatment plant equipped with industrial scale pumps blenders and engines this study is expected to give new insights into the future implementation of the carbon neutral anmbr pn a process in real treatment of municipal wastewater also facilitating a better understanding and popularizing of the inception of carbon neutrality in wastewater treatment process engineering 2 materials and methods 2 1 apparatus and equipment a schematic diagram of the large pilot scale submerged anmbr integrated with the one stage pn a reactor and the energy flowchart is illustrated in fig 1 the energy consumption of experimental equipment and apparatus like pumps and blenders are also marked since the energy consumption of the anmbr was compared with the activated sludge process in this study a conceptual engineering flowchart of the a2 o process is also given in the figure as an ideal assumption of the real engineering application the pilot scale submerged anmbr owning an operational volume of 5 m3 is the largest submerged pilot scale plant in the world the anmbr was integrated with a one stage carrier type pn a reactor with an operational volume of 1 67 m3 the entire anmbr pn a system was constructed and established by mitsubishi kakoki co ltd japan the experimental devices and apparatus equipped in the system are full scale engines which can be used in a real wastewater treatment plant the membrane module of the anmbr is consisted of 12 units of hollow fiber membrane 1 02 m 0 62 m with the total area of 72 m2 the membrane is made by mitsubishi chemical corporation japan with the material of polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf approximately 20 of the volume for the pn a reactor was filled with the hollow cylinder shaped carrier the carrier with a diameter of 1 cm made of hydrophobic polypropylene resin was dosed into the reactor to be suspended and fluctuated with sludge as the frame for the attachment of biofilm 2 2 municipal wastewater and sludge inoculum since the anmbr pn a system was located in an open space of a local wastewater treatment plant the real municipal wastewater used for the anmbr was taken directly from the grit chamber nearby the pollutants component of real municipal wastewater was stable and the detailed characteristics are given in table 1 the municipal wastewater initially requires a grille device which screened and removed the large size impurities like rocks and sands and then pumped into the anmbr as the influent wastewater the digestate of the anmbr or permeate effluent in which the majority of the organic matter was degraded was permeated from the anmbr and then flowed into the pn a reactor for nitrogen removal 18 the anmbr was inoculated with the anaerobic digested sludge directly sourced from the local plant 5 while the pn a reactor was inoculated with activated sludge along with anammox sludge which had been cultivated for over half a year 32 2 3 experimental procedure and analytic methods the experimental procedure is as same as that in our previous studies 5 18 the biogas was sampled every day with the detection of biogas production temperature of biogas components of biogas the wastewater parameters including ph cod bod5 nh4 n no2 n no3 n and tn were recorded three times a week and the mlss of sludge was measured once a week the measurement methods all follow our previous studies 18 31 the majority of engines and motors implemented in the anmbr pn a system was managed by a real time auto control electronic system designed and programed by mitsubishi kakoki co ltd japan some of the parameters like do water temperature transmembrane pressure tmp were automatically recorded and stored in the computer memory for further data processing the influent and permeate pumps were automatically on and off to maintain a stable operation of the anmbr and pn a the permeating mode of the membrane was 4 min on and 1 min off since the volume of the pn a reactor was just 1 3 of that for the anmbr the hrt of the pn a was also 1 3 of the anmbr 2 4 calculations and data processing 2 4 1 energy recovery the evaluation of energy consumed and produced in the anmbr pn a system was normalized into the unit of electricity as kwh m3 1 kwh 3600 kj which means the electricity input or output for the treatment of 1 m3 of real municipal wastewater it should be noted that only the electricity for wastewater treatment process was considered in this study while the electricity for the post treatment like sludge digestion was not included for the output electricity the energy recovered from methane including dissolved methane is the only source of energy recovery generated by methane combustion e c 24 the definition of the energy recovery e recovery is described in eq 1 and listed in table 2 since the degradation of cod in the a2 o process is an aerobic process and no energy is produced from the wastewater treatment process engineering by the a2 o the ad of excessive sludge was not considered in this study therefore e recovery of the a2 o process is considered as zero 2 4 2 energy consumed during the wastewater treatment process engineering the total energy consumed e consumption for the entire anmbr pn a system can be defined as the electrical machinery and is defined and listed in table 2 it should be noted that while the entire system was operated under an ambient temperature of approximately 25 c and the reactor heating for the municipal wastewater treatment was not needed in this study as shown in fig 1 the energy consumed by the electrical machinery is responsible for the operation of pumps blenders and blowers some of the pumps were used for wastewater and sludge transferring pumps e t whose energy consumption can be calculated by eq 2 it should be noted that the anmbr pn a system needs two pump for the wastewater transferring and two pump for sludge discharge while the assumed a2 o system requires two pumps for influent transferring one pumps for effluent transferring and two pumps for sludge backflow and discharge the effluent pump of the anmbr is the membrane permeating pump which is different from the wastewater transferring pumps and the energy consumption can be calculated following eq 3 the tmp of the membrane during the stable permeating period was determined by a digital sensor connected to the permeate pipe and the data of tmp were recorded and restored in the memory of the auto control computer system the blender e b was used for stirring the wastewater or sludge whose energy consumption can be calculated by eq 4 52 the anmbr pn a system requires three blenders while the a2 o needs two blenders the energy evaluation of the blower or air pump for the anmbr was also differed from that of the pn a reactor and the a2 o the blower equipped by the anmbr was used for the inner recirculation of biogas sparging e s which is capable of controlling the membrane fouling the energy consumed by the blower of the anmbr can be calculated using eq 5 17 the blower for both the pn a and a2 o processes e a was used for supplying sufficient do to main the biological reaction for the pn a system since the partial nitritation requires a relatively low do concentration only half of the nh4 is oxidized into no2 however for the a2 o process the blowers should provide a high do concentration for both the degradation of cod and the nitrification reactor which completely oxidizes nh4 into no3 the energy consumed by the blowers for both the pn a and the a2 o processes can be evaluated using eq 6 to eq 10 it should be noted that the oxygen supply for the microbial growth during the aerobic degradation of cod the partial nitritation and the nitrification was all neglected in this study the theoretical net potential p et of energy was the difference value of e recovery and e consumption to estimate the total energy consumption and production during the long term treatment of real municipal wastewater apparently a higher positive value of p et suggests a good carbon neutral potential which is capable of producing energy and the renewable energy could cover all the energy consumed during the wastewater treatment process a negative value of p et means the process is energy intensive it should be noted that the theoretical net potential of energy was obtained based on empirical equations of eq 1 to eq 10 with theoretical calculations which was not that convincing because the process engineering flow of both the anmbr pn a and a2 o system was simplified in this study for the real wastewater treatment process engineering the practical net potential p ep of energy was assessed by summing the total electricity consumption of electronic engines used in an assumed full scale wastewater treatment plant which owns a daily treatment capacity of 10 000 m3 the information of rated power efficiency and operational time of full scale pumps and engines were all provided by mitsubishi kakoki co ltd whose main business is the manufacturing and constructing of equipment for water process engineering 2 4 3 evaluation of co2 emission during the treatment of municipal wastewater the principle of carbon neutrality is on the basis of low carbon technologies for which aim at reducing the co2 emission during the wastewater treatment process engineering 17 53 54 therefore the reduction of co2 emission should also be considered in the carbon neutral treatment of municipal wastewater in this study the equivalent co2 emission c e kg co2 m3 wastewater was defined to quantitatively evaluate the emitted and reduced amount of co2 during the wastewater treatment process of both anmbr pn a and a2 o apparently a relatively low value of c e suggests that the process is capable of reducing co2 emission as shown in table 3 the co2 emitted from the wastewater treatment is consisted of these proportions 1 co2 produced from the biodegradation of organic matter c cod which is obtained from the operational result of co2 production the co2 produced from the anmbr was measured every day while the co2 produced from the a2 o process was estimated by assuming an empirical conversion efficiency of cod degraded to co2 of 70 while the rest of 30 was converted to sludge biomass 5 2 co2 produced from the combustion of methane c me for electricity generation this proportion of co2 is only sourced from the anmbr and can be calculated using eq 11 while the there is no c me for the a2 o in this study the dissolved methane c dm remained in the digestate effluent of the anmbr should also be considered as greenhouse gas and calculated as equivalent co2 3 co2 produced from the electron donor c ed during the conventional heterotrophic denitrification for the a2 o process while which was not considered for the pn a process because the pn a is an autotrophic bioprocess 2 42 since it is well known that methanol ch3oh is typically used as the electron donor in heterotrophic denitrification process for the wastewater treatment plant this proportion of co2 can be estimated based on the tn removal efficiency following the stoichiometric equations of eq 12 4 co2 produced from the fossil fuel or coal fired power plant c pp which supplies all the electricity for the wastewater treatment process 55 56 this proportion of co2 is calculated based on the result of e consumption during the entire wastewater treatment process engineering of both anmbr pn a and a2 o process by eq 13 a empirical coefficient of 0 52 kg co2 kwh is used to estimate the value of c pp 57 the proportion of co2 saved c sa by the energy recovery is based on the result of e recovery which is also a negative value by eq 14 2 4 4 expense of energy in wastewater treatment process engineering the expense paid for the electricity consumption during the long term treatment of municipal wastewater is also assessed in this study it is reported that the electricity price for industrial use is about 0 53 cny kwh in jiangsu province of china 58 a full scale wastewater treatment plant capable of dealing with 10 000 m3 of wastewater every day was assumed in this study to evaluate the total electricity expenditure between the anmbr pn a and a2 o processes for the carbon neutral treatment of the real municipal wastewater 3 results and discussion 3 1 overall performance of long term operation the large pilot scale anmbr pn a system has exhibited promising feasibility in the treatment of low strength real municipal wastewater by effectively removing both organic pollutants and nitrogen 5 32 the long term operational results of the anmbr pn a system were discussed in detail in our previous related studies 31 45 the overall average performance of the anmbr pn a is shown in table 1 while the pilot scale anmbr system realized a good cod removal at a shortest hrt of 6 h the stable operation just lasted for two weeks 18 therefore the hrt of 8 h was considered as the appropriate operational condition for the anmbr the anmbr obtained a high cod removal of 90 while the pn a system helped consume a proportion of residual cod in the digestate of the anmbr realizing a total cod removal efficiency of 95 for the entire anmbr pn a system 32 the average nh4 n concentration of the influent municipal wastewater was just 26 mg l and the degradation of nitrogenous organic matter resulted in a higher nh4 n of 33 mg l in the digestate of the anmbr the pn a system finally obtained a high nh4 n removal of 76 and a tn removal efficiency of 82 3 2 assessment of energy balance 3 2 1 energy produced from municipal wastewater the recovery of methane from the municipal wastewater meets the goal of carbon neutrality because the bio methane produced from the organic pollutants contained in wastewater can be reserved as bio energy instead of directly being emitted into atmosphere 59 60 as shown in table 1 fed with the real municipal wastewater which has an average cod concentration of 414 mg l the anmbr obtained a methane yield of 75 8 l m3 with 90 cod removal efficiency on average the dissolved methane contained in the digestate of the anmbr was about 2 1 l m3 however since the recycle of the dissolved methane from wastewater also consumes a large quantity of energy 61 the energy recovered from dissolved methane is neglected in this part of discussion the ch4 content of the biogas exceeded 75 and was higher than that in other related studies like the ad of food waste 16 20 therefore the bio methane produced from municipal wastewater is considered as a renewable energy source of bio fuel which produces approximately 0 278 kwh m3 of e recovery with the combustion of ch4 using a conversion efficiency of 35 for power generating 62 3 2 2 energy consumption of the anmbr pn a and a2 o as shown in table 4 and fig 2 for the anmbr pn a system two pumps were used for wastewater transferring raw wastewater to grille reserve tank reserve tank to the anmbr two pump was used for sludge discharge and backflow as a result the total energy consumption of pumps e t was summed as 0 044 kwh m3 three blenders were used for stirring wastewater sludge and carriers and the total energy consumption of blender e b was relatively low summed as 4 7 10 4 kwh m3 one blower was used for internal biogas circulation sparging along with the membrane fouling flushing in the anmbr and e s was estimated as 0 080 kwh m3 which accounted for the largest proportion of energy consumption for the anmbr air blower was used for supplying do for the partial nitritation and e a of pn a was calculated as 0 012 kwh m3 the energy consumption of permeate pump was concerned with the value of tmp during the hrt of 8 h and e p was calculated as 0 015 kwh m3 in summary the total energy consumption e consumption of the pilot scale anmbr pn a process was 0 151 kwh m3 the activated sludge process equipped with a2 o technology needs more pumps three pumps were used for wastewater transferring two pumps were used for sludge discharge and backflow and one pump for membrane backflow regents the total energy consumption of pumps e t was 0 031 kwh m3 for the a2 o two blenders were used for the a2 o process and e b of blenders in the a2 o was just 3 1 10 4 kwh m3 one aeration blower were needed for the degradation of cod and nitrification in which e a of cod degradation and nitrification was calculated as 0 256 kwh m3 which accounted for the highest energy consumption for the a2 o process in summary the total energy consumption e consumption of the assumed a2 o process was estimated at a high level of 0 287 kwh m3 apparently the theoretical net potential p et of the a2 o was a totally negative value of 0 287 kwh m3 suggesting that the a2 o is an energy intensive process which is unable to recover energy during the aerobic treatment of municipal wastewater without the consideration of ad of excessive sludge however p et of the anmbr pn a was a positive value of 0 127 kwh m3 with the energy recovery considered demonstrating that the energy recycled from municipal wastewater has the ability to cover all energy consumed during the wastewater treatment process and even earning extra energy therefore from the perspective of theoretical evaluation of the potential in energy recovery the anmbr pn a was proved as a sustainable and renewable process for the carbon neutral treatment of municipal wastewater 3 2 3 practical evaluation of energy in an assumed full scale wastewater treatment plant since the evaluation of the energy consumption of both the anmbr pn a and a2 o was simplified a more precise and convincing evaluation of energy was conducted from the practical wastewater treatment process engineering as shown in fig 3 and table 5 with the more complicated procedure of wastewater treatment process and the implementation of full scale pumps and engines in the wastewater treatment plant the practical energy consumption of both the anmbr pn a and a2 o was higher than the theoretical ones apparently from the practical perspective of wastewater process engineering more devices and equipment were used during the entire progress the value of e consumption of the anmbr pn a was 0 322 kwh m3 while that of the a2 o can be up to 0 460 kwh m3 which was in accordance with the reported electricity cost of 0 3 0 6 kwh m3 for the a2 o 62 however while the practical net potential p ep of the a2 o was still negative p ep the anmbr pn a turned out to be a negative value of 0 044 kwh m3 even though the recovery of bio methane failed to completely cover the all energy consumed during the wastewater process engineering the sustainability and cost effectiveness of the anmbr pn a was still demonstrated in this study compared with the a2 o process the anmbr equipped with pn a could save 0 138 kwh m3 of electricity for municipal wastewater treatment by neglecting methane recovery which accounted for 30 of the total energy consumption of the a2 o process with the methane combustion for electricity generation the anmbr pn a saved 0 416 kwh m3 of electricity by 90 therefore the result of the practical evaluation of demonstrates that the anmbr pn a is an energy saving process for the carbon neutral treatment of municipal wastewater 3 3 carbon neutral potential in co2 emission the reduction of co2 emission is the representative feature of carbon neutrality and the co2 emission equivalent c e of the anmbr pn a and a2 o processes are assessed based on eq 12 to 15 and the results are shown in fig 4 and table 6 for the anmbr benefited from the advantage of ad only a small proportion of cod was converted into co2 and the direct co2 emission is recorded in table 1 with c cod 0 011 kg co2 m3 for the a2 o process it is reported that about 25 50 of the cod is converted to sludge and the majority of cod is degraded to co2 assumed as 70 and the c cod can be estimated as 0 398 kg co2 m3 the ch4 produced from the anmbr was expected to be combusted for electricity generation and resulted in a c me of 0 149 kg co2 m3 for the denitrification process of the a2 o methanol is typically used as the electron donor in heterotrophic denitrification with the reducing of no3 n methanol is oxidized into co2 following eq 15 and the denitrification of the a2 o results in a c ed of 0 042 kg co2 m3 since the electricity in most of the developing countries like china is generated by the fossil fuel or coal fired power plant the use of electricity for the wastewater treatment process suggests a certain proportion of co2 is emitted from the power plant by burning the fossil fuel or coal with the coefficient of 0 52 kg co2 kwh for the power plant and e consumption was 0 287 kwh m3 the value of c pp was calculated as 0 149 kg co2 m3 for the a2 o process it should also be noted that the energy produced by methane combustion recovered a large proportion of energy consumption of the anmbr process and resulted in a negative value of c sa of 0 145 kg co2 m3 however if the produced methane is reserved as bio fuel instead of being combusted into co2 c me and c sa turned out to be zero and c e was calculated as 0 079 kg co2 m3 it should be emphasized that while the energy recovery of the tiny amount of the dissolved methane contained in the digestate effluent of the anmbr was neglected the greenhouse effect of these dissolved methane of c dm 0 004 kg co2 m3 should also be seriously concerned apparently without the consideration of methane combustion the co2 emission equivalent c e of the anmbr pn a was 0 090 kg co2 m3 which is much lower than the value of 0 380 kg co2 m3 for the a2 o process the anmbr pn a reduced 75 9 of co2 emission compared with the a2 o with the consideration of methane combustion c e of the anmbr pn a was slightly elevated to 0 094 kg co2 m3 because ch4 was oxidized into co2 by combustion however this value was still much lower than the a2 o reducing 74 9 of co2 which supposes to be emitted into the atmosphere therefore the result of the assessment of co2 emission is clear evidence that the anmbr process integrated with pn a has shown promising carbon neutral potential in reducing the co2 emission during the wastewater treatment process engineering 3 4 electricity expenditure of municipal wastewater treatment as can be seen in table 7 and fig 4 by assuming that a full scale wastewater treatment plant which is equipped with the a2 o process for the treatment of municipal wastewater at the hrt of 8 h for a daily treatment capacity of 10 000 m3 the plant will pay 2438 cny day and 0 89 million cny year for electricity expenditure in contrast if the plant was equipped with the anmbr pn a process the total electricity expenditure of the plant was reduced to 1707 cny day and 0 62 million cny year without the energy recovery of methane combustion by further recycling the produced methane as bio energy the anmbr pn a process just needs to pay 233 cny day and 0 09 million cny year for the successful establishment of the carbon neutral treatment of municipal wastewater apparently the anmbr pn a process significantly saved the electricity expenditure of 0 80 million cny every year for a full scale wastewater treatment plant which accounted for 90 of that for the a2 o process therefore this is valid evidence again that the anmbr process integrated with pn a is a cost effective and sustainable technology which has the remarkable potential in the carbon neutral treatment of municipal wastewater in the future 4 conclusions the potential in carbon neutrality of a large pilot scale anmbr process integrated with pn a technology was demonstrated by comparing the feasibility in energy recovery and co2 emission with the a2 o process for the treatment of real low strength municipal wastewater in this study the anmbr pn a system has revealed its remarkable superiorities over the activated sludge process bio methane produced from municipal wastewater can be used for electricity generation which could covered 90 of the total electricity consumption during the operation of anmbr pn a the integrated system has the potential to save electricity expense for a full scale wastewater treatment plant in comparison with the a2 o the anmbr pn a system is also capable of reducing co2 emission compared with the a2 o process declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper

12858,the promising sustainability and potential in carbon neutrality of the anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr integrated with partial nitritation anammox pn a was assessed using a large pilot scale plant the entire pilot scale system was conducted for a long term continuous operation of 217 days succeeding in the effective carbon neutral treatment of low strength real municipal wastewater with excellent cod removal efficiency of higher than 90 the major proportion of the organic matter was converted into bio methane which can be recovered as bio energy or bio fuel the residual ammonium contained in the digestate effluent of the anmbr was further treated by a pilot scale one stage pn a reactor the long term operation of the pilot scale anmbr was compared with the empirical assumption of the anaerobic anoxic oxic a2 o process exhibiting splendid feasibilities in both ecological and economical perspectives including energy conservation and recovery reduction of co2 emission and electricity expenditure saving for municipal wastewater treatment the application of anmbr pn a process helps reducing the energy consumption of 0 416 kwh m3 during the wastewater treatment process engineering of municipal wastewater accounting for 90 of that for the a2 o the anmbr pn a is also capable of reducing the co2 emission reduced by 74 9 a full scale wastewater treatment plant implemented with the anmbr pn a process could save the electricity expenditure by 0 80 million cny annually the results of this work are solid evidence that the anmbr pn a process is a remarkable sustainable technology also giving new insights into the concept of carbon neutral treatment of municipal wastewater in future studies keywords anaerobic digestion municipal wastewater anmbr carbon neutrality partial nitritation anammox data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction municipal wastewater characterized by low chemical oxygen demand cod concentration and high content of suspended solid ss is acknowledged as a source of low strength wastewater which is typically treated by the conventional activated sludge cas process 1 3 while the cas process has served as a widely adopted biological wastewater treatment process for decades this outdated technology is faced with such demerits like high consumption of electricity during the aeration progress and the expense for the disposal of wasted excessive sludge 4 6 with the growing concern over energy conservation and co2 reduction by the concept of carbon neutrality the cas is considered unsuitable for the current wastewater process engineering 7 8 fortunately the anaerobic digestion ad process has exhibited its sustainable advantages like high organic loading endurance low excessive sludge yield and bio energy recycle and is also likely to become an alternative to the cas process 9 14 however a formidable contradiction which limits the implementation of ad to municipal wastewater is that the process engineering for the daily treatment of huge quantities of wastewater requires short hydraulic retention times hrt along with short solids retention times srt 15 18 while both the hrt and srt should be long for the ad process in order to maintain the proliferation and degradation ability of anaerobic microorganisms 19 21 the anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr capable of decoupling hrt and srt currently considered as a reliable technology suitable for the carbon neutral treatment of municipal wastewater 22 26 the anmbr process also facilitates the enhancement of bio methane production and cod removal by retaining the anaerobic digested sludge and ss inside the digester under short hrts 12 17 27 29 while the organic matter could be effectively degraded by ad with the anmbr technology the carbon neutral removal of nitrogen one of the major inorganic pollutants is also a great concern for the treatment of the low strength municipal wastewater 30 32 the conventional biological nitrogen removal is consisted of nitrification and denitrification during which the ammonium nh4 is oxidized into nitrate no3 and then reduced to nitrogen gas n2 via a two phase process 2 33 35 this nitrogen removal process is typically combined with the upgraded activated sludge derivatives like the anaerobic oxic a o and anaerobic anoxic oxic a2 o process also sharing the drawbacks of the them high dissolved oxygen do supplied by the aeration for nitrification and extra supplement of carbon source to provide electron donor for denitrification 36 39 the partial nitritation anammox pn a an integrated process consisted of partial nitrification pn and the anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox has exhibited the promising feasibility in treating low strength ammonium containing wastewater 40 43 compared to the conventional nitrification denitrification process derived from the a o or a2 o the pn a process has been widely reported to have the remarkable abilities of significantly reducing aeration organic carbon source sludge yield and co2 emission 35 38 44 consequently for the removal of both organic and inorganic pollutants from municipal wastewater the anmbr process combined with pn a technology is more cost effective than the typical derivatives of the cas process due to their promising energy saving and low carbon advantages 27 31 45 46 therefore the integration of the anmbr with pn a is considered suitable to the carbon neutral treatment of municipal wastewater and has been demonstrated in some previous related studies influent cod is removed by the anmbr while the nh4 in the digestate is further removed by pn a 31 32 47 nevertheless most of the previous studies focused on anmbr and pn a simply used lab scale reactors which were fed by the synthetic municipal wastewater in their experiments 48 49 therefore in our previous studies a large pilot scale submerged anmbr integrated with one stage pn a reactor was constructed in a local wastewater treatment plant 5 45 the anmbr system succeeded in a long term anaerobic treatment of the real municipal wastewater by obtaining high cod removal and bio methane recovery with low sludge yield 45 and the pn a system also effectively removed the residual nh4 from the digestate of the anmbr 31 32 while the theoretical feasibility of the anmbr pn a technology has been clearly demonstrated a precise and practical assessment of the carbon neutral advantages of this process is considered essential and should be qualified by a large pilot scale plant for the real wastewater process engineering of municipal wastewater treatment 50 51 this study aims at revealing the energy saving and energy productive superiorities of the anmbr pn a process to the a2 o process a comparative evaluation between the anmbr pn a and a2 o should be made by investigating the co2 emission energy consumption production and also the expenditure during the long term treatment of real municipal wastewater the theoretical evaluation of energy consumption production co2 emission along with expenditure calculated following empirical equations on the basis of the operational results of the anmbr pn a the practical assessment of the feasibility in waster process engineering was estimated by assuming the process is implemented in a real wastewater treatment plant equipped with industrial scale pumps blenders and engines this study is expected to give new insights into the future implementation of the carbon neutral anmbr pn a process in real treatment of municipal wastewater also facilitating a better understanding and popularizing of the inception of carbon neutrality in wastewater treatment process engineering 2 materials and methods 2 1 apparatus and equipment a schematic diagram of the large pilot scale submerged anmbr integrated with the one stage pn a reactor and the energy flowchart is illustrated in fig 1 the energy consumption of experimental equipment and apparatus like pumps and blenders are also marked since the energy consumption of the anmbr was compared with the activated sludge process in this study a conceptual engineering flowchart of the a2 o process is also given in the figure as an ideal assumption of the real engineering application the pilot scale submerged anmbr owning an operational volume of 5 m3 is the largest submerged pilot scale plant in the world the anmbr was integrated with a one stage carrier type pn a reactor with an operational volume of 1 67 m3 the entire anmbr pn a system was constructed and established by mitsubishi kakoki co ltd japan the experimental devices and apparatus equipped in the system are full scale engines which can be used in a real wastewater treatment plant the membrane module of the anmbr is consisted of 12 units of hollow fiber membrane 1 02 m 0 62 m with the total area of 72 m2 the membrane is made by mitsubishi chemical corporation japan with the material of polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf approximately 20 of the volume for the pn a reactor was filled with the hollow cylinder shaped carrier the carrier with a diameter of 1 cm made of hydrophobic polypropylene resin was dosed into the reactor to be suspended and fluctuated with sludge as the frame for the attachment of biofilm 2 2 municipal wastewater and sludge inoculum since the anmbr pn a system was located in an open space of a local wastewater treatment plant the real municipal wastewater used for the anmbr was taken directly from the grit chamber nearby the pollutants component of real municipal wastewater was stable and the detailed characteristics are given in table 1 the municipal wastewater initially requires a grille device which screened and removed the large size impurities like rocks and sands and then pumped into the anmbr as the influent wastewater the digestate of the anmbr or permeate effluent in which the majority of the organic matter was degraded was permeated from the anmbr and then flowed into the pn a reactor for nitrogen removal 18 the anmbr was inoculated with the anaerobic digested sludge directly sourced from the local plant 5 while the pn a reactor was inoculated with activated sludge along with anammox sludge which had been cultivated for over half a year 32 2 3 experimental procedure and analytic methods the experimental procedure is as same as that in our previous studies 5 18 the biogas was sampled every day with the detection of biogas production temperature of biogas components of biogas the wastewater parameters including ph cod bod5 nh4 n no2 n no3 n and tn were recorded three times a week and the mlss of sludge was measured once a week the measurement methods all follow our previous studies 18 31 the majority of engines and motors implemented in the anmbr pn a system was managed by a real time auto control electronic system designed and programed by mitsubishi kakoki co ltd japan some of the parameters like do water temperature transmembrane pressure tmp were automatically recorded and stored in the computer memory for further data processing the influent and permeate pumps were automatically on and off to maintain a stable operation of the anmbr and pn a the permeating mode of the membrane was 4 min on and 1 min off since the volume of the pn a reactor was just 1 3 of that for the anmbr the hrt of the pn a was also 1 3 of the anmbr 2 4 calculations and data processing 2 4 1 energy recovery the evaluation of energy consumed and produced in the anmbr pn a system was normalized into the unit of electricity as kwh m3 1 kwh 3600 kj which means the electricity input or output for the treatment of 1 m3 of real municipal wastewater it should be noted that only the electricity for wastewater treatment process was considered in this study while the electricity for the post treatment like sludge digestion was not included for the output electricity the energy recovered from methane including dissolved methane is the only source of energy recovery generated by methane combustion e c 24 the definition of the energy recovery e recovery is described in eq 1 and listed in table 2 since the degradation of cod in the a2 o process is an aerobic process and no energy is produced from the wastewater treatment process engineering by the a2 o the ad of excessive sludge was not considered in this study therefore e recovery of the a2 o process is considered as zero 2 4 2 energy consumed during the wastewater treatment process engineering the total energy consumed e consumption for the entire anmbr pn a system can be defined as the electrical machinery and is defined and listed in table 2 it should be noted that while the entire system was operated under an ambient temperature of approximately 25 c and the reactor heating for the municipal wastewater treatment was not needed in this study as shown in fig 1 the energy consumed by the electrical machinery is responsible for the operation of pumps blenders and blowers some of the pumps were used for wastewater and sludge transferring pumps e t whose energy consumption can be calculated by eq 2 it should be noted that the anmbr pn a system needs two pump for the wastewater transferring and two pump for sludge discharge while the assumed a2 o system requires two pumps for influent transferring one pumps for effluent transferring and two pumps for sludge backflow and discharge the effluent pump of the anmbr is the membrane permeating pump which is different from the wastewater transferring pumps and the energy consumption can be calculated following eq 3 the tmp of the membrane during the stable permeating period was determined by a digital sensor connected to the permeate pipe and the data of tmp were recorded and restored in the memory of the auto control computer system the blender e b was used for stirring the wastewater or sludge whose energy consumption can be calculated by eq 4 52 the anmbr pn a system requires three blenders while the a2 o needs two blenders the energy evaluation of the blower or air pump for the anmbr was also differed from that of the pn a reactor and the a2 o the blower equipped by the anmbr was used for the inner recirculation of biogas sparging e s which is capable of controlling the membrane fouling the energy consumed by the blower of the anmbr can be calculated using eq 5 17 the blower for both the pn a and a2 o processes e a was used for supplying sufficient do to main the biological reaction for the pn a system since the partial nitritation requires a relatively low do concentration only half of the nh4 is oxidized into no2 however for the a2 o process the blowers should provide a high do concentration for both the degradation of cod and the nitrification reactor which completely oxidizes nh4 into no3 the energy consumed by the blowers for both the pn a and the a2 o processes can be evaluated using eq 6 to eq 10 it should be noted that the oxygen supply for the microbial growth during the aerobic degradation of cod the partial nitritation and the nitrification was all neglected in this study the theoretical net potential p et of energy was the difference value of e recovery and e consumption to estimate the total energy consumption and production during the long term treatment of real municipal wastewater apparently a higher positive value of p et suggests a good carbon neutral potential which is capable of producing energy and the renewable energy could cover all the energy consumed during the wastewater treatment process a negative value of p et means the process is energy intensive it should be noted that the theoretical net potential of energy was obtained based on empirical equations of eq 1 to eq 10 with theoretical calculations which was not that convincing because the process engineering flow of both the anmbr pn a and a2 o system was simplified in this study for the real wastewater treatment process engineering the practical net potential p ep of energy was assessed by summing the total electricity consumption of electronic engines used in an assumed full scale wastewater treatment plant which owns a daily treatment capacity of 10 000 m3 the information of rated power efficiency and operational time of full scale pumps and engines were all provided by mitsubishi kakoki co ltd whose main business is the manufacturing and constructing of equipment for water process engineering 2 4 3 evaluation of co2 emission during the treatment of municipal wastewater the principle of carbon neutrality is on the basis of low carbon technologies for which aim at reducing the co2 emission during the wastewater treatment process engineering 17 53 54 therefore the reduction of co2 emission should also be considered in the carbon neutral treatment of municipal wastewater in this study the equivalent co2 emission c e kg co2 m3 wastewater was defined to quantitatively evaluate the emitted and reduced amount of co2 during the wastewater treatment process of both anmbr pn a and a2 o apparently a relatively low value of c e suggests that the process is capable of reducing co2 emission as shown in table 3 the co2 emitted from the wastewater treatment is consisted of these proportions 1 co2 produced from the biodegradation of organic matter c cod which is obtained from the operational result of co2 production the co2 produced from the anmbr was measured every day while the co2 produced from the a2 o process was estimated by assuming an empirical conversion efficiency of cod degraded to co2 of 70 while the rest of 30 was converted to sludge biomass 5 2 co2 produced from the combustion of methane c me for electricity generation this proportion of co2 is only sourced from the anmbr and can be calculated using eq 11 while the there is no c me for the a2 o in this study the dissolved methane c dm remained in the digestate effluent of the anmbr should also be considered as greenhouse gas and calculated as equivalent co2 3 co2 produced from the electron donor c ed during the conventional heterotrophic denitrification for the a2 o process while which was not considered for the pn a process because the pn a is an autotrophic bioprocess 2 42 since it is well known that methanol ch3oh is typically used as the electron donor in heterotrophic denitrification process for the wastewater treatment plant this proportion of co2 can be estimated based on the tn removal efficiency following the stoichiometric equations of eq 12 4 co2 produced from the fossil fuel or coal fired power plant c pp which supplies all the electricity for the wastewater treatment process 55 56 this proportion of co2 is calculated based on the result of e consumption during the entire wastewater treatment process engineering of both anmbr pn a and a2 o process by eq 13 a empirical coefficient of 0 52 kg co2 kwh is used to estimate the value of c pp 57 the proportion of co2 saved c sa by the energy recovery is based on the result of e recovery which is also a negative value by eq 14 2 4 4 expense of energy in wastewater treatment process engineering the expense paid for the electricity consumption during the long term treatment of municipal wastewater is also assessed in this study it is reported that the electricity price for industrial use is about 0 53 cny kwh in jiangsu province of china 58 a full scale wastewater treatment plant capable of dealing with 10 000 m3 of wastewater every day was assumed in this study to evaluate the total electricity expenditure between the anmbr pn a and a2 o processes for the carbon neutral treatment of the real municipal wastewater 3 results and discussion 3 1 overall performance of long term operation the large pilot scale anmbr pn a system has exhibited promising feasibility in the treatment of low strength real municipal wastewater by effectively removing both organic pollutants and nitrogen 5 32 the long term operational results of the anmbr pn a system were discussed in detail in our previous related studies 31 45 the overall average performance of the anmbr pn a is shown in table 1 while the pilot scale anmbr system realized a good cod removal at a shortest hrt of 6 h the stable operation just lasted for two weeks 18 therefore the hrt of 8 h was considered as the appropriate operational condition for the anmbr the anmbr obtained a high cod removal of 90 while the pn a system helped consume a proportion of residual cod in the digestate of the anmbr realizing a total cod removal efficiency of 95 for the entire anmbr pn a system 32 the average nh4 n concentration of the influent municipal wastewater was just 26 mg l and the degradation of nitrogenous organic matter resulted in a higher nh4 n of 33 mg l in the digestate of the anmbr the pn a system finally obtained a high nh4 n removal of 76 and a tn removal efficiency of 82 3 2 assessment of energy balance 3 2 1 energy produced from municipal wastewater the recovery of methane from the municipal wastewater meets the goal of carbon neutrality because the bio methane produced from the organic pollutants contained in wastewater can be reserved as bio energy instead of directly being emitted into atmosphere 59 60 as shown in table 1 fed with the real municipal wastewater which has an average cod concentration of 414 mg l the anmbr obtained a methane yield of 75 8 l m3 with 90 cod removal efficiency on average the dissolved methane contained in the digestate of the anmbr was about 2 1 l m3 however since the recycle of the dissolved methane from wastewater also consumes a large quantity of energy 61 the energy recovered from dissolved methane is neglected in this part of discussion the ch4 content of the biogas exceeded 75 and was higher than that in other related studies like the ad of food waste 16 20 therefore the bio methane produced from municipal wastewater is considered as a renewable energy source of bio fuel which produces approximately 0 278 kwh m3 of e recovery with the combustion of ch4 using a conversion efficiency of 35 for power generating 62 3 2 2 energy consumption of the anmbr pn a and a2 o as shown in table 4 and fig 2 for the anmbr pn a system two pumps were used for wastewater transferring raw wastewater to grille reserve tank reserve tank to the anmbr two pump was used for sludge discharge and backflow as a result the total energy consumption of pumps e t was summed as 0 044 kwh m3 three blenders were used for stirring wastewater sludge and carriers and the total energy consumption of blender e b was relatively low summed as 4 7 10 4 kwh m3 one blower was used for internal biogas circulation sparging along with the membrane fouling flushing in the anmbr and e s was estimated as 0 080 kwh m3 which accounted for the largest proportion of energy consumption for the anmbr air blower was used for supplying do for the partial nitritation and e a of pn a was calculated as 0 012 kwh m3 the energy consumption of permeate pump was concerned with the value of tmp during the hrt of 8 h and e p was calculated as 0 015 kwh m3 in summary the total energy consumption e consumption of the pilot scale anmbr pn a process was 0 151 kwh m3 the activated sludge process equipped with a2 o technology needs more pumps three pumps were used for wastewater transferring two pumps were used for sludge discharge and backflow and one pump for membrane backflow regents the total energy consumption of pumps e t was 0 031 kwh m3 for the a2 o two blenders were used for the a2 o process and e b of blenders in the a2 o was just 3 1 10 4 kwh m3 one aeration blower were needed for the degradation of cod and nitrification in which e a of cod degradation and nitrification was calculated as 0 256 kwh m3 which accounted for the highest energy consumption for the a2 o process in summary the total energy consumption e consumption of the assumed a2 o process was estimated at a high level of 0 287 kwh m3 apparently the theoretical net potential p et of the a2 o was a totally negative value of 0 287 kwh m3 suggesting that the a2 o is an energy intensive process which is unable to recover energy during the aerobic treatment of municipal wastewater without the consideration of ad of excessive sludge however p et of the anmbr pn a was a positive value of 0 127 kwh m3 with the energy recovery considered demonstrating that the energy recycled from municipal wastewater has the ability to cover all energy consumed during the wastewater treatment process and even earning extra energy therefore from the perspective of theoretical evaluation of the potential in energy recovery the anmbr pn a was proved as a sustainable and renewable process for the carbon neutral treatment of municipal wastewater 3 2 3 practical evaluation of energy in an assumed full scale wastewater treatment plant since the evaluation of the energy consumption of both the anmbr pn a and a2 o was simplified a more precise and convincing evaluation of energy was conducted from the practical wastewater treatment process engineering as shown in fig 3 and table 5 with the more complicated procedure of wastewater treatment process and the implementation of full scale pumps and engines in the wastewater treatment plant the practical energy consumption of both the anmbr pn a and a2 o was higher than the theoretical ones apparently from the practical perspective of wastewater process engineering more devices and equipment were used during the entire progress the value of e consumption of the anmbr pn a was 0 322 kwh m3 while that of the a2 o can be up to 0 460 kwh m3 which was in accordance with the reported electricity cost of 0 3 0 6 kwh m3 for the a2 o 62 however while the practical net potential p ep of the a2 o was still negative p ep the anmbr pn a turned out to be a negative value of 0 044 kwh m3 even though the recovery of bio methane failed to completely cover the all energy consumed during the wastewater process engineering the sustainability and cost effectiveness of the anmbr pn a was still demonstrated in this study compared with the a2 o process the anmbr equipped with pn a could save 0 138 kwh m3 of electricity for municipal wastewater treatment by neglecting methane recovery which accounted for 30 of the total energy consumption of the a2 o process with the methane combustion for electricity generation the anmbr pn a saved 0 416 kwh m3 of electricity by 90 therefore the result of the practical evaluation of demonstrates that the anmbr pn a is an energy saving process for the carbon neutral treatment of municipal wastewater 3 3 carbon neutral potential in co2 emission the reduction of co2 emission is the representative feature of carbon neutrality and the co2 emission equivalent c e of the anmbr pn a and a2 o processes are assessed based on eq 12 to 15 and the results are shown in fig 4 and table 6 for the anmbr benefited from the advantage of ad only a small proportion of cod was converted into co2 and the direct co2 emission is recorded in table 1 with c cod 0 011 kg co2 m3 for the a2 o process it is reported that about 25 50 of the cod is converted to sludge and the majority of cod is degraded to co2 assumed as 70 and the c cod can be estimated as 0 398 kg co2 m3 the ch4 produced from the anmbr was expected to be combusted for electricity generation and resulted in a c me of 0 149 kg co2 m3 for the denitrification process of the a2 o methanol is typically used as the electron donor in heterotrophic denitrification with the reducing of no3 n methanol is oxidized into co2 following eq 15 and the denitrification of the a2 o results in a c ed of 0 042 kg co2 m3 since the electricity in most of the developing countries like china is generated by the fossil fuel or coal fired power plant the use of electricity for the wastewater treatment process suggests a certain proportion of co2 is emitted from the power plant by burning the fossil fuel or coal with the coefficient of 0 52 kg co2 kwh for the power plant and e consumption was 0 287 kwh m3 the value of c pp was calculated as 0 149 kg co2 m3 for the a2 o process it should also be noted that the energy produced by methane combustion recovered a large proportion of energy consumption of the anmbr process and resulted in a negative value of c sa of 0 145 kg co2 m3 however if the produced methane is reserved as bio fuel instead of being combusted into co2 c me and c sa turned out to be zero and c e was calculated as 0 079 kg co2 m3 it should be emphasized that while the energy recovery of the tiny amount of the dissolved methane contained in the digestate effluent of the anmbr was neglected the greenhouse effect of these dissolved methane of c dm 0 004 kg co2 m3 should also be seriously concerned apparently without the consideration of methane combustion the co2 emission equivalent c e of the anmbr pn a was 0 090 kg co2 m3 which is much lower than the value of 0 380 kg co2 m3 for the a2 o process the anmbr pn a reduced 75 9 of co2 emission compared with the a2 o with the consideration of methane combustion c e of the anmbr pn a was slightly elevated to 0 094 kg co2 m3 because ch4 was oxidized into co2 by combustion however this value was still much lower than the a2 o reducing 74 9 of co2 which supposes to be emitted into the atmosphere therefore the result of the assessment of co2 emission is clear evidence that the anmbr process integrated with pn a has shown promising carbon neutral potential in reducing the co2 emission during the wastewater treatment process engineering 3 4 electricity expenditure of municipal wastewater treatment as can be seen in table 7 and fig 4 by assuming that a full scale wastewater treatment plant which is equipped with the a2 o process for the treatment of municipal wastewater at the hrt of 8 h for a daily treatment capacity of 10 000 m3 the plant will pay 2438 cny day and 0 89 million cny year for electricity expenditure in contrast if the plant was equipped with the anmbr pn a process the total electricity expenditure of the plant was reduced to 1707 cny day and 0 62 million cny year without the energy recovery of methane combustion by further recycling the produced methane as bio energy the anmbr pn a process just needs to pay 233 cny day and 0 09 million cny year for the successful establishment of the carbon neutral treatment of municipal wastewater apparently the anmbr pn a process significantly saved the electricity expenditure of 0 80 million cny every year for a full scale wastewater treatment plant which accounted for 90 of that for the a2 o process therefore this is valid evidence again that the anmbr process integrated with pn a is a cost effective and sustainable technology which has the remarkable potential in the carbon neutral treatment of municipal wastewater in the future 4 conclusions the potential in carbon neutrality of a large pilot scale anmbr process integrated with pn a technology was demonstrated by comparing the feasibility in energy recovery and co2 emission with the a2 o process for the treatment of real low strength municipal wastewater in this study the anmbr pn a system has revealed its remarkable superiorities over the activated sludge process bio methane produced from municipal wastewater can be used for electricity generation which could covered 90 of the total electricity consumption during the operation of anmbr pn a the integrated system has the potential to save electricity expense for a full scale wastewater treatment plant in comparison with the a2 o the anmbr pn a system is also capable of reducing co2 emission compared with the a2 o process declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper

highlighted and recommendations regarding future research gaps are provided graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords mxenes metal carbides heavy metals water treatment adsorption 1 introduction the increase in population alongside the unplanned urbanization and rapid industrialization had boosted the global demand and consumption of freshwater at the same time it resulted in severe water pollution that presents a serious risk to the environment humans and marine life 1 2 most often mining and recovery operations and various industrial processes discharge wastewater that contains various heavy metals and metalloids such as as iii cu ii cr vi cd ii pb ii zn ii and different rare earth elements that can be reached to the natural water bodies 3 4 these pollutants if not treated efficiently could lead to severe environmental and health concerns therefore the removal of such potentially toxic elements from these discharges is an essential step to protect the environment human health and aquatic life literature reported the applications of different treatment methods in removing heavy metal ions from water such as ion exchange 5 chemical precipitation 6 electrodialysis 7 membrane filtration 8 9 photocatalytic degradation 10 advanced oxidation 11 biological methods 12 13 and adsorption 14 16 most of these treatment methods have certain disadvantages in treating wastewater such as the generation of sludge and byproducts incomplete elimination of toxic ions not being useful at very low concentrations of pollutants disposal challenges complex mechanism excessive chemicals usage complex regeneration and higher energy consumption 17 in recent years various nanomaterials have exhibited tremendous potential in water decontamination due to their remarkable physicochemical features 4 18 mxenes commonly refers to as two dimensional 2d transition metal carbides nitrides or carbonitrides are the class of emerging advanced nanomaterials that unveiled applications in environmental remediation sensors catalysis and energy storage the key features of mxenes that make them the superlative contenders for various applications are their exceptional structural characteristics like the ease of functionalization activated metallic hydroxide sites biocompatibility huge specific surface area hydrophilicity large interlayer spacing remarkable chemical stability and superior adsorption reduction capacity 19 20 in water treatment mxenes have been employed as adsorbents for the removal of various contaminants as a filler for the synthesis of mxene based membranes and as a photocatalyst for the degradation of toxic pollutants 17 21 23 ever since the discovery of ti3c2 ti3alc2 nanosheets in 2011 at drexel university numerous members of this family have been successfully synthesized and applied for the adsorptive elimination of different environmental pollutants 24 25 mxenes are generally represented by the formula mn 1xntx where m is an early transition metal like ti mo w zr etc x represents carbon nitrogen t denotes surface termination groups like cl f o and oh while x indicates the number of surface functional groups and n range from 1 to 4 26 27 this review critically evaluates the adsorptive elimination of heavy metal ions from the water phase through the application of mxene based adsorbents the synthesis routes and different physicochemical characteristics of the composite materials are evaluated and various influencing factors on the adsorption of potentially toxic metal ions are studied in detail the adsorption mechanism and regeneration abilities are carefully analyzed and finally a road map is suggested for future research gaps 2 synthesis of mxenes and their composites traditionally the mxenes were prepared by the application of the hydrofluoric acid hf etching method and the surface of exfoliated mxenes was then frequently adorned by various functional groups containing h oh and f 28 30 generally mxenes are synthesized from the max phases through selective etching of the a element layers by the application of appropriate etching agents such as hf lithium fluoride hydrochloric acid lif hcl and ammonium bifluoride nh4hf2 31 33 fig 1a represents the 2d structure of different max phases m2x m3x2 m4x3 for n 1 2 and 3 respectively 34 pristine mxenes are developed through modest preparation procedures as discussed above however functionalized modified mxene based composites involve comparative complex synthesis methods fig 1b depicts the synthesis process of 2d mxene mx wherein at first a specific amount of lif was dissolved in hcl solution followed by subsequent addition of ti3alc2 and etching at ambient temperature 35 the mixture after etching was ultrasonic centrifuged for the solid liquid separation followed by final drying surface modification of mxene based adsorbents is a good approach for improving the pollutants uptake performance the amino functionalized ti3c2tx nanosheets were synthesized by the alkalization grafting method 36 before grafting ti3c2tx is made alkalized for obtaining oh groups and the hydroxide radicals then formed covalent bonds via dehydration reaction after interacting with the produced silanol groups intermolecular hydrolysis fig 1c illustrates the synthesis route of mxene polyethylenimine pei modified sodium alginate sa aerogel mpa through the cross linking reaction between the pei and amino functionalized ti3c2tx into sa aerogel matrix 37 the functionalization of the mxene surface could also affect its physicochemical properties and adsorption characteristics fig 2a depicts the preparation of biosurfactant functionalized ti2ctx 38 first the ti2ctx was prepared through the al etching of ti2alc second the etched sample was bath sonicated under argon atmosphere and centrifuged to obtain supernatant containing monolayer ti2ctx third a biosurfactant solution was added to the ti2ctx supernatant stirred and freeze dried to obtain the biosurfactant functionalized ti2ctx powder in the same way the fabrication of amino functionalized mxenes nh2 ti3c2tx was completed in several steps first of all raw ti3c2tx was prepared via an exfoliation process 39 in the second step functionalization of the already synthesized ti3c2tx powder was performed where 1 0 g of ti3c2tx was added to 30 ml of ethanol and 10 ml of di water 1 ml of 3 aminopropyl triethoxysilane aptes was added to the suspension and stirred filtered washed and dried at 40 c in a vacuum oven fig 2b represents the synthesis route of nh2 ti3c2tx 39 the dried product nh2 ti3c2tx was finally ground to powder and stored in vacuum for further applications fig 2c portrays the multi step synthesis route of nanoscale zero valent iron alkalized mxene nzvi alk ti3c2tx composites the nzvi alk ti3c2tx was prepared with three different fe alk ti3c2tx mass ratios of 3 1 1 1 and 1 2 40 first of all ti3c2tx nanoflakes were obtained via in situ hf etching using lif hcl method followed by ultrasonication and centrifugation a fixed amount 0 5 g of the prepared ti3c2tx was dispersed in a 50 ml solution of 1 m naoh and the mixture was stirred under an n2 atmosphere and washed with ultrapure water to obtain alk ti3c2tx the reduction of fecl2 4h2o with nabh4 in alk ti3c2tx under the n2 atmosphere then yielded nzvi alk ti3c2tx similarly the fabrication process of imidazoles mxene hybrid ti3c2 imiz composites is presented in fig 2d 41 in the first step etching of ti3alc2 was completed by treating its fixed amount 2 g with 30 ml hf solution then stirred and dried the raw product was further intercalated with anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide dmso for 24 h at 70 c followed by multiple centrifugations with ethanol and distilled water and freeze drying in the next step amino groups on ti3c2 were introduced via radziszewski reaction using raw reagents such as chitosan acetic acid methylglyoxal and formaldehyde the choice of synthesis and modification methods would strongly influence the characteristics of mxene based adsorbents and their performance in removing heavy metal ions in the aqueous phase 3 physicochemical properties of mxene based adsorbents the presence of diverse functional groups high specific surface area and tunable surface chemistry makes mxenes the ideal candidates to be employed in water treatment processes 42 the synthesis routes of mxenes often had an impact on the physicochemical characteristics of its compounds that in turn affect their adsorption potentials various functional groups e g oh o and f often develop on the surface of mxenes during etching procedures 25 similarly increasing the immersion time and temperature and reducing the particle size of the ti3alc2 often led to the faster conversion of ti3alc2 to ti3c2 29 likewise the alk mxene not only had a large number of oh and ona but also obtained additional nh2 via aptes treatment 36 the high specific surface area and improved adsorption capacity of amino functionalized ti3c2tx alk mxene nh2 nanosheets were obtained due to the improved characteristics of mxenes after alkalization grafting modification 36 43 similarly the presence of oh coo and ch groups of biopolymer alginate mx sa4 20 also played a vital role in the adsorption of hg ii ions 44 literature also reported the transformation of surface functional groups during synthesis and modifications of mxene based materials in the case of 2d alk mxene ti3c2 oh ona x f2 x material after exfoliation the exposed ti surfaces are terminated by f or oh groups and the partial f groups transform to oh that in turn change to ona after alkalization 45 the pb ii adsorption is more linked to hydroxyl groups and the intercalation of an oxygen atom with ti3c2 is much stronger compared to the oxygen of hydroxyl in ti3c2 o2h2 2m pb m similarly the surface functionalization of pristine ti3c2 with ionic liquid il resulted in more active sites on the ti3c2 imiz surface which in turn resulted in its higher adsorption performance 41 similarly the hydroxyl functional groups are also formed on the surface of the intercalated mxene that acts as the key binding positions for the metal cations specific surface areas and surface properties are the physicochemical characteristics of adsorbents that had a strong influence on their adsorption capabilities a study measured the bet specific surface areas to be about 0 5 m2 g and 67 66 m2 g for the multilayer ml ti3c2tx and delaminated dl ti3c2tx respectively 46 this large difference is attributed to the delamination of mxene into one or a few sheets that resulted in enhanced specific surface area the improved adsorption capacity 93 mg g of nh2 ti3c2tx 0 5 compared to pristine ti3c2tx 56 2 mg g for cr vi ions is due to the improved surface characteristics of nh2 ti3c2tx 39 further increasing the aptes content yielded a lower capacity of nh2 ti3c2tx 1 0 up to 54 mg g due to a sharp drop in its specific surface area 8 6 m2 g therefore nh2 ti3c2tx 0 5 nanosheets possess the maximum cr vi adsorption due to its net positive surface and appropriate specific surface area in a similar study the specific surface area of pristine ti3c2tx was calculated to be about 68 39 m2 g which was reduced to 56 51 m2 g for the magnetic titanium carbide ti3c2tx fe2o3 mxene hybrid nanocomposites mgmx due to the grafting of fe2o3 nanoparticles on ti3c2tx surface 47 likewise the stability of mxenes is mainly dependent on the synthesis conditions amount of surface terminations sheet quality and the degree of exfoliation the mxene stability could be enhanced by its surface modifications and appropriate storage in oxygen free degassed water or dry air besides storage in a chilled environment or in dry conditions under vacuum could also assist in slowing down the oxidation of colloidal mxene solutions 42 mxenes ti3c2tx powders are thermally stable at temperatures below 200 c in an o2 containing environment and up to 800 c under an argon ar atmosphere ti3c2tx undergoes surface oxidation at 200 c in an oxygen environment to anatase tio2 and amorphous carbon 42 48 49 the first step in the mxene degradation mechanism is the oxidation of the mxene surface to form anatase crystals that could protect the unreactive mxene from oxidation while the second step implicates the progressive oxidation of residual mxene at elevated temperature because of the expedited o2 diffusion through the anatase till transformation of all mxene to co2 tio2 and the anatase to rutile 49 4 adsorption of heavy metals the removal of toxic metal ions from the aqueous phase is a necessary step in treating toxic effluents as it severely affects the living organisms mxene based adsorbents exhibited outstanding adsorption potentials for the removal of toxic heavy metals from the water environment 50 51 table 1 presents a summary of published literature on the applications of mxenes derived adsorbents for the removal of heavy metals from water the adsorption capacity adsorption mechanism regeneration potential experimental conditions and surface characteristics of mxene based adsorbents are highlighted the adsorbents performed well in a diverse ph range from 2 to 11 but in most cases the optimum adsorption potential was measured at a ph range of 3 7 similarly room temperature rt was used in most of the reported studies these reflect the useful applications of adsorbents in the natural environment under normal conditions the mechanisms of toxic heavy metal ions removal include chelation chemical coordination chemisorption diffusion electrostatic interactions ion exchange physisorption reductive adsorption surface complexation and van der waals interactions 5 key influencing parameters 5 1 ph solution ph is a crucial factor that affects both the surface charge and the heavy metal ions distribution and often leads to electrostatic interactions between the nanomaterial and pollutants 31 a study described the critical effect of the initial ph value of the solution in a limited range 2 6 on the pb ii remediation by mxene where divalent cations were transformed to neutral or monovalent pb oh i and pb oh 2 at higher ph values 7 52 therefore a significant improvement in pb ii uptake was noticed with a rise in ph from 2 to 6 the point of zero charge phpzc value is important since they help in determining the net surface charge of the adsorbents generally at ph phpzc the adsorbent surface becomes negatively charged and therefore display favorable adsorption against cationic pollutants in case when ph phpzc the adsorbent surface is net positive which helps in the preferred adsorption of anionic pollutants a study reported the phpzc of dl ti3c2tx to be 2 7 and therefore the surface of the nanosheets was negatively charged at ph 2 7 thus promoting the electrostatic attraction between the cu ii ions and the adsorbent surface 46 the zeta potential value of mgmx at ph 9 was measured to be about 30 mv clearly describing its electrostatically stable nature 47 the same adsorbent exhibited poor removal efficiency of 18 70 in an acidic environment ph 2 which is attributed to ionic repulsion between the net positive mgmx nanocomposite and the metal cations the removal efficiency and adsorption capacity abruptly enhanced to 91 46 and 43 91 mg g with a rise in ph value to 3 5 because of the changes in surface charges of the nanocomposite however the adsorbent exhibited a slow rise in hg ii uptake in the ph range of 3 5 6 and observed maximum uptake performance 47 46 mg g and 98 89 at ph 6 followed by a reduction in adsorption potential of the mgmx nanocomposite with a further rise in ph from 6 to 9 due to hg ii complexation similarly the phpzc of the mgmx adsorbent was 3 2 and therefore the adsorbent surface would exhibit a positive charge by adsorbing h ions from acidic solution at ph 3 2 resulting in electrostatic repulsion between the metal cations and positively charged nanocomposite 47 however at ph 3 2 the presence of a large number of hydroxyl ions is responsible for the electrostatic attraction of the negatively charged adsorption sites and metal cations that led to the enhanced adsorption capacity of the employed adsorbent fig 3a represents the combined effect of temperature and ph on hg ii adsorption by the mx adsorbent 35 the optimum hg ii uptake was obtained at ph values near 4 5 35 fig 3b exemplifies the values of initial solution ph after adsorption and phpzc 2 03 of the modified mxene mx adsorbent before adsorption 35 therefore the mx surface is negatively charged when the ph value exceeds 2 03 thus higher ph values of the solution are more advantageous to electrostatic adsorption of hg ii ions fig 3c shows the inverse effect of solution ph on the adsorption capacities of mxene and mxene based composites for cr vi ions the maximum adsorption capacity of 96 7 mg g was attained for the nh2 ti3c2tx 0 5 at ph 2 3 39 this adverse behavior is attributed to the majority of hcro4 anions under acidic conditions and the electrostatic attraction between these anions and abundant protonated amino groups of nh2 ti3c2tx enhanced the uptake capacity a study also explored favorable adsorption of cr vi by the 2d ti3c2tx nanosheets in both acidic and neutral environments however its removal efficiency was reduced in the basic environment 53 this is due to the fact that protonation occurs in strongly acidic environments because of the electrostatic attraction between adsorbent and pollutant ions the dominant form of cr vi is hcro4 at solution ph range 2 6 and cro2 4 when ph is higher than 6 this means that electrostatic repulsion is the key factor behind lower cr vi uptake at a higher ph value of the solution precipitation of pollutants at higher ph could also inversely affect the adsorption potential of mxene derived adsorbents the pb ii adsorption onto the dl ti3c2tx was also found to be ph depended as the adsorbent exhibited lower adsorption at lower values of solution ph this is attributed to the competition between the pollutants and h ions for gaining access to the surface sites 46 the possible hydroxyl terminal protonation on nanosheet surfaces makes it positively charged in a strongly acidic environment the adsorption capacity and removal efficiency increased up to 39 24 mg g and 79 respectively with an improved initial value of solution ph from 2 to 5 however at ph values beyond 5 these values started downward trends this inverse behavior is attributed to the cu ii precipitation into cu oh 2 at a ph higher than 5 5 2 effect of temperature temperature is another parameter affecting the adsorption rate of toxic metal ions by the mxene derived adsorbents a study reported improved pb ii adsorption with an increase in solution temperature from 293 k to 313 k because of increased pb ii diffusion onto the mxene and a reduced boundary layer thickness of mxene 52 54 fig 3d shows a slight increase in cu ii uptake by the ti3c2tx nanosheets with a rise in temperature and the maximum adsorption capacity of 43 34 mg g was obtained at 318 k 46 the combined effect of temperature and ph on hg ii adsorption by the mx adsorbent is illustrated in fig 3a which shows the positive effect of temperature in the range of 10 30 c on hg ii adsorption 35 the adsorption capacity improved with a rise in temperature representing the endothermic nature of adsorption fig 3e describes a positive correlation of varying temperatures from 15 c to 55 c on the removal rate of ni ii by the alk mxene layered double metal hydroxide ldh adsorbent 55 however the elevated temperature is usually not preferred due to economic constraints 5 3 effect of contact time the adsorption of various toxic pollutants also depends upon how long the interactions between the adsorbate and adsorbent are going on generally the adsorption rate at the start of the process is quite fast due to the availability of vacant sites however the rate slows down after a certain time due to steering to pores saturation and there occurs no substantial change in adsorption potential once adsorption equilibrium is achieved a study reported the adsorption of cr vi by the 2d ti3c2tx nanosheets where the adsorption efficiency was fast during the initial stages due to the synergistic effects between the adsorbent and the pollutants in an aqueous environment 53 the saturation was achieved within 40 min because of the presence of electrostatic interactions ion exchange and complexation mechanisms and there appeared no substantial change after saturation of the employed adsorbent fig 3f represents the cr vi uptake performance of pristine ti3c2 and ti3c2 imiz adsorbents 41 for ti3c2 imiz the adsorption capacity rapidly enhanced to 66 91 mg g in the very first minute of adsorption followed by slow improvement to 111 31 mg g and reached a near saturation state after which the adsorption equilibrium was achieved in 80 min with adsorption capacity of 119 5 mg g 41 the somehow longer equilibrium contact time is due to the il functionalization of the ti3c2 adsorbent fig 4a illustrates the adsorption performances of ti3c2tx nh2 ti3c2tx 0 2 nh2 ti3c2tx 0 5 and nh2 ti3c2tx 1 0 against the elimination of cr vi 39 it is depicted from fig 4a that the adsorption capacities for both adsorbents significantly enhanced within the first 30 min followed by a slow rise on further growth in contact time and the adsorption equilibrium was achieved at 120 min 5 4 effect of adsorbent dosage adsorbent dosage is the most important factor in determining the adsorption potential of the employed adsorbents as it directly affects the adsorption rate increasing the adsorbent dosage often results in an improved adsorption rate but decreased adsorption capacity of an adsorbent towards potentially toxic metal ions this is because with increased adsorbent dosage under constant pollutants concentrations numerous adsorption sites could stay vacant which results in decreased adsorption capacities of adsorbents besides a high adsorbent amount could also result in overlapping of the binding sites for adsorption of lethal pollutants that in turn adversely affect the adsorption rate of toxic ions a study reported the effect of dl ti3c2tx dosage on its adsorption potential and there observed an increase in removal rate with improved adsorbent concentration from 0 1 g l to 1 5 g l 46 the adsorption efficiency abruptly enhanced from 48 to 97 when increasing the adsorbent amount from 0 1 g l to 1 5 g l the initial surge in cu ii removal rate is due to the availability of numerous vacant active sites that got occupied by the pollutants and reached a near saturation state after 1 g l adsorbent concentration fig 4b illustrates the effect of mxene chitosan cs dosage on the cr vi removal efficiency and the adsorbent capacity with increased dosage from 0 02 g l to 0 12 g l the adsorption capacity reduced from 30 5 mg g to 16 1 mg g while the removal efficiency improved from 12 9 to 40 5 56 the growth in removal efficiency is attributed to the availability of more contact surface area and numerous adsorption sites at higher adsorbent dosages while lower adsorption capacity might be the result of the limited amount of adsorbed cr vi per unit of adsorbent 5 5 effect of initial concentration of heavy metal ions the initial concentration of toxic heavy metal ions had a strong effect on the adsorption performance of mxene derived adsorbents generally with an increased concentration of heavy metal ions limited improvement in adsorption rate occurs due to the availability of a large number of pollutant ions to be adsorbed onto the easily accessible vacant sites on the adsorbent surface on further increasing the concentration of the heavy metals the adsorbent surface reached the saturation point and there happens no substantial variation in the adsorption potential of the adsorbent after the equilibrium is attained fig 4c illustrates the effect of varying cr vi concentration on the adsorption performance of mxene cs and shows the equilibrium adsorption capacity to be about 50 6 mg g 13 mg g and 10 10 mg g for the corresponding cr vi concentrations of 100 mg l 50 mg l and 20 mg l respectively this might have happened because higher pollutants concentration generated a concentration gradient that in turn affected the diffusional flow of heavy metal ions this in turn overcomes the mass transfer resistance of the heavy metal ions from the bulk solution to adsorb on the surface of the employed adsorbent while lower pollutant concentration might result in the availability of extra vacant sites left on adsorbent surfaces 57 5 6 effect of coexisting ions wastewater contains various pollutants such as common co ions like bicarbonates chlorides and sulfates that often led to competitive adsorption on the reactive sites on mxenes 53 a study reported a higher selectivity of nh2 ti3c2tx 0 5 nanosheets for cr vi adsorption in the presence of competing ions cl so4 2 cu2 fe3 and ni2 39 a contradictory approach was also studied where pb ii adsorption decreased with increased cationic strength in the order ca ii mg ii na i k i because of the competition between cations and pb ii ions 52 the hydrated ca ii radius 4 12 nm is closest to that of hydrated pb ii 4 01 nm thus it maximally reduced the pb ii uptake literature also described the use of the mixed solutions of competing ions such as cd ii cu ii ni ii and pb ii in assessing the selective adsorption of hg ii 35 the employed adsorbent exhibited a substantial removal rate almost 100 towards hg ii ions and pb ii and cu ii removal rates were observed to be about 50 and 7 59 respectively a study reported the effect of ca ii and mg ii ions on pb ii uptake by the alk mxene and compared its selective removal potential with a commercial polystyrene ion exchange resin 001 7 with sulfonic acid groups 45 the addition of competing ions ca ii and mg ii might affect the pb ii adsorption but overall the alk mxene exhibited remarkable adsorption behavior by increasing the number of competing ions the adsorption characteristics of alk mxene were slightly affected compared to that of 001 7 which reflects the selective adsorption feature of the mxene derived adsorbent the outstanding selectivity of the alk mxene adsorbent is mainly due to the rich surface groups that favors the interactions of pb ii ions with the surface of alk mxene 45 it is clear from fig 5a that the cr vi uptake is hardly affected by the presence of coexisting anions br cl so4 2 and co3 2 when their concentrations were quite lower about 0 001 m and 0 01 m however the effect is dominant when the concentration of the anions reached 0 1 m 37 this result happened due to the competitive interactions between the chromium species cr2o7 2 cro4 2 and hcro4 and the coexisting anions for the corresponding active sites on the surface of the employed adsorbent mpa 10 with pei mass of 5 0 g besides the presence of 0 1 m co3 2 could also improve the solution ph to a larger extent that weakened the adsorbent s protonation process thus weakening the electrostatic attractions between the toxic metal ions and the adsorbent fig 5b depicts the better selectivity of cr vi adsorption in the presence of coexisting cations where the pollutant removal was only slightly influenced due to the occupation of some of the vacant active sites by the existing cations 37 such studies demonstrated that mxene based adsorbents have the potential to selectively adsorb the toxic metal ions from water and can be employed in real water treatment systems in future 6 adsorption mechanism in order to have a detailed analysis of the adsorption of potentially toxic elements mechanism studies should be assessed various spectroscopic techniques adsorption isotherms and kinetics and theoretical calculations such as density functional theory are necessary to be carried out so as to have an idea about the exact probable uptake mechanism the abundant reaction sites and surface functional groups of novel nanomaterials would assist in the efficient elimination of heavy metal ions 31 the commonly reported mechanisms of toxic heavy metal ions removal include chelation chemical coordination chemisorption diffusion electrostatic interactions ion exchange physisorption reductive adsorption surface complexation and van der waals interactions fig 6 fig 7a illustrates a three step cr vi uptake mechanism onto the ti3c2 tio2 composites in an acidic environment the concentration of h ions in solution and positive charge on the adsorbent surface is higher which electrostatically attracts the negatively charged cr2o7 2 however this activity is reduced under basic conditions increased ph 58 the cr2o7 2 then started reduction with the help of h ions when in contact with the adsorbent surface the last step is the formation of ti o cr iii and then ti c cr iii as a result of fixing attaching the reduced cr iii moieties to the tio2 surface through a covalent bond with the tio bond similarly the proposed ni ii removal mechanism by the alk mxene ldh under weak acidic conditions is shown in fig 7b where the adsorbed heavy metal ni ii would form the coordination complex or precipitate at the surface of the base mxene ldh 55 the complex formation electrostatic interactions and ion exchange were the dominant adsorption mechanisms of hg ii adsorption onto the mx sa4 20 44 the inner surface complexation and ion exchange between the tio h and hg ii and between the ca ii and hg ii were responsible for hg ii confiscation 44 similarly fig 7c exemplifies the cr vi uptake mechanism by the nh2 ti3c2tx 0 5 nanosheets 39 in the first the amino groups nh3 nh2 could preferentially adsorb the cr vi ions reduction of cr vi to cr iii also takes place and cr vi along with the cr iii is adsorbed onto the nh2 ti3c2tx 0 5 surface the adsorption mechanism of cr vi by the ti3c2tx nanosheets is illustrated in fig 7d 59 the major steps involved are reduction of cr vi to cr iii electrostatic interactions between the adsorbent surface and the negatively charged cr2o7 2 in an acidic environment and precipitation of cr oh 3 at ph 4 8 59 certain characterization tools could also help in exploring the uptake mechanisms the sem and tem analyses of the alk mxene ldh pointed to the presence of adsorbed fine nanoparticles compounds or complexes containing ni ii on the layered surface of the composite adsorbent 55 another study analyzed after adsorption ftir analysis whose large shifts in peaks of tio band pointed to the manifestation of strong affinities between tio and pb ii ions that might result from the formation of inner sphere complex onto the alk mxene surface 45 similarly sem xps and other simulation measurements showed the possibilities of chemisorption rather than physisorption in another study according to the zeta potential measurement of the mx surface the material surface contains a large amount of negative charge and therefore part of hg ii was adsorbed by the electrostatic action similarly fesem micrographs exhibited the presence of adsorbed mercuric ions 35 the proposed interaction mechanism of mercury nitrate and mercury chloride on the mx surface is depicted in fig 7e 35 7 regeneration of mxene based adsorbents the possibility of recovering heavy metal ions from the loaded mxene based adsorbents and their reusability is a necessary step in controlling the cost of the adsorbent environmental threats and the toxic sludge disposal problem literature reported the applications of diverse eluents like hcl hno3 nh4oh h2so4 na2co3 naoh koh di water and na2edta for desorption of adsorbed pollutants by the mxene derived adsorbents table 1 a study explained the recyclability of mos2 mx ii adsorbent where the hg ii desorption was observed to be about 37 3 against 5 m hcl eluent after 3 h contact time however the desorption was improved to 55 with increased contact time up to 30 h 60 regardless of the longer contact time and high concentration of eluent the adsorbent mos2 mx ii exhibited better performance even at low hg ii concentration 0 08 mm after five cycles fig 8a 60 another study reported the regeneration study of mxene alginate composite by the application of 0 1 m hno3 with better adsorption stability till ten adsorption desorption cycles 61 the cross linked composite exhibited better adsorption performance compared to uncross linked composite throughout all the regeneration cycles however the adsorption rate reduced significantly for the uncross linked mxene alginate composite after four stages this occur because the cross linked composite with calcium ions had high structural stability compared to the pristine composite and therefore its adsorption loss rate for cu ii and pb ii were observed to be 5 4 and 8 9 after ten regeneration stages in the case of uncross linked composite this rate was 12 7 and 13 1 for the cu ii and pb ii respectively similarly cr vi desorption from the loaded ti3c2 imiz was performed by treating the composite with naoh eluent followed by di water and about 76 71 relative removal ratio was observed 41 this reduction in adsorption potential occurred owing to the mass loss of adsorbent and barring of active sites on the surface due to cr iii irreversibility the regeneration performance of ni ii loaded alk mxene ldh composite after regeneration with ammonium hydroxide solution is displayed in fig 8b 55 it is observed that by increasing the nh4oh concentration from 0 01 m to 1 0 m the ni ii desorption rate also improved the employed composite adsorbent exhibited a slight reduction in its adsorption potential after successive adsorption desorption stages due to a decrease in adsorbent concentration after multiple washing and incomplete desorption of heavy metal ions fig 8c illustrates the nine adsorption desorption stages of mx against the confiscation of hg ii 35 the removal rate of hg ii slightly reduced from 99 8 to 96 3 after nine regeneration cycles and only 3 5 loss was observed for hg ii for the fifth cycle compared to the first regeneration stage 35 fig 8d presents the reusability performance of mpa 10 till five consecutive adsorption desorption cycles where the drop in adsorption capacity was observed after the fifth cycle 37 these studies suggest that the mxene based adsorbents can be employed effectively as they not only exhibited excellent potential for the removal of heavy metals but also met the requirements for recycling and metal ions recovery 8 challenges and future prospects though the mxene based adsorbents exhibited high reusability enhanced stability and remarkable adsorption potential against the elimination of toxic heavy metal ions in water treatment technologies still numerous challenges require careful attention and therefore need to be addressed the major hurdles and directions for future research are summarized below the synthesis methods of mxenes can be improved to obtain the final structures with desired characteristics for specific applications furthermore the applications of toxic chemicals such as hf in the synthesis of mxenes have serious environmental and health concerns although there is some progress in the hf free synthesis of mxenes still the development of novel facile and efficient strategies are desirable applications of green chemistry can lead to the development of a synthesis route with less usage of toxic chemicals or alternate green chemicals can be employed to produce mxenes lab scale synthesis techniques of mxene and its derived adsorbents are expensive and the yield is also low hence future work should emphasize more on the development of more effective ways for synthesizing mxene nanocomposites on a larger scale at moderate cost the applications of mxene based adsorbents in real wastewater are limited the reported studies in the literature are performed on a lab scale under controlled environmental conditions for these materials to be the next generation materials for various applications the potential of these materials on a commercial scale under real conditions should be assessed the detailed mechanisms of confiscation of heavy metal ions from the water environment need to be explored in this regard different characterization tools and theoretical models may be employed regeneration of the loaded mxene derived adsorbents is a good step in determining the efficacy economic and stability of the employed adsorbents therefore special attention is needed towards various eluents applied for the desorption of adsorbed metal ions the use of alternative green eluents compared to acidic alkalis and basic eluents need to explore on behalf of the environmental perspective ti3c2 is the most widely used structure in water treatment however due to the presence of a large number of structures in this family the potential of other mxenes structures beyond ti3c2 should also be explored in water treatment other alternative applications of mxene derived composites such as light trapping ability faster charge transfer rate electromagnetic shielding energy storage photo electrochemical catalysis etc need comprehensive exploration in detail the vast potential of mxene nanocomposites in applications other than water purifications should also explore to analyze its diverse applications another major challenge is the stability and storage of mxenes mxenes due to their oxidative nature could oxidize easily in an aqueous environment therefore their long term storage without degradation should be resolved to fully explore the potential of these materials in various applications lastly the potentially toxic and environmental effects of these materials should be explored to safeguard human health and the environment 9 conclusion this review aimed to critically assess the latest innovations in applications of mxene based adsorbents to remediate potentially toxic metal ions from water mxene derived adsorbents have demonstrated remarkable adsorption potential for the confiscation of potentially toxic metal ions from an aqueous phase most of the mxene based adsorbents demonstrated higher adsorption capacity exceptional regeneration potential and excellent selectivity for the removal of desired metals from water however still several barriers exist that restrict their applications in practical water treatment systems despite all these hurdles the current research progress suggests that these 2d materials have the potential to dominate future energy storage water treatment and desalination technologies declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper

detail with an emphasis on the effect of key influencing factors such as solution ph concentration of metal ions adsorbent dosage temperature contact time and the presence of coexisting ions the heavy metals uptake mechanisms are carefully evaluated and the reusability potential is also explored major hurdles related to the mxenes and their derived adsorbents in real water treatment are also highlighted and recommendations regarding future research gaps are provided graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords mxenes metal carbides heavy metals water treatment adsorption 1 introduction the increase in population alongside the unplanned urbanization and rapid industrialization had boosted the global demand and consumption of freshwater at the same time it resulted in severe water pollution that presents a serious risk to the environment humans and marine life 1 2 most often mining and recovery operations and various industrial processes discharge wastewater that contains various heavy metals and metalloids such as as iii cu ii cr vi cd ii pb ii zn ii and different rare earth elements that can be reached to the natural water bodies 3 4 these pollutants if not treated efficiently could lead to severe environmental and health concerns therefore the removal of such potentially toxic elements from these discharges is an essential step to protect the environment human health and aquatic life literature reported the applications of different treatment methods in removing heavy metal ions from water such as ion exchange 5 chemical precipitation 6 electrodialysis 7 membrane filtration 8 9 photocatalytic degradation 10 advanced oxidation 11 biological methods 12 13 and adsorption 14 16 most of these treatment methods have certain disadvantages in treating wastewater such as the generation of sludge and byproducts incomplete elimination of toxic ions not being useful at very low concentrations of pollutants disposal challenges complex mechanism excessive chemicals usage complex regeneration and higher energy consumption 17 in recent years various nanomaterials have exhibited tremendous potential in water decontamination due to their remarkable physicochemical features 4 18 mxenes commonly refers to as two dimensional 2d transition metal carbides nitrides or carbonitrides are the class of emerging advanced nanomaterials that unveiled applications in environmental remediation sensors catalysis and energy storage the key features of mxenes that make them the superlative contenders for various applications are their exceptional structural characteristics like the ease of functionalization activated metallic hydroxide sites biocompatibility huge specific surface area hydrophilicity large interlayer spacing remarkable chemical stability and superior adsorption reduction capacity 19 20 in water treatment mxenes have been employed as adsorbents for the removal of various contaminants as a filler for the synthesis of mxene based membranes and as a photocatalyst for the degradation of toxic pollutants 17 21 23 ever since the discovery of ti3c2 ti3alc2 nanosheets in 2011 at drexel university numerous members of this family have been successfully synthesized and applied for the adsorptive elimination of different environmental pollutants 24 25 mxenes are generally represented by the formula mn 1xntx where m is an early transition metal like ti mo w zr etc x represents carbon nitrogen t denotes surface termination groups like cl f o and oh while x indicates the number of surface functional groups and n range from 1 to 4 26 27 this review critically evaluates the adsorptive elimination of heavy metal ions from the water phase through the application of mxene based adsorbents the synthesis routes and different physicochemical characteristics of the composite materials are evaluated and various influencing factors on the adsorption of potentially toxic metal ions are studied in detail the adsorption mechanism and regeneration abilities are carefully analyzed and finally a road map is suggested for future research gaps 2 synthesis of mxenes and their composites traditionally the mxenes were prepared by the application of the hydrofluoric acid hf etching method and the surface of exfoliated mxenes was then frequently adorned by various functional groups containing h oh and f 28 30 generally mxenes are synthesized from the max phases through selective etching of the a element layers by the application of appropriate etching agents such as hf lithium fluoride hydrochloric acid lif hcl and ammonium bifluoride nh4hf2 31 33 fig 1a represents the 2d structure of different max phases m2x m3x2 m4x3 for n 1 2 and 3 respectively 34 pristine mxenes are developed through modest preparation procedures as discussed above however functionalized modified mxene based composites involve comparative complex synthesis methods fig 1b depicts the synthesis process of 2d mxene mx wherein at first a specific amount of lif was dissolved in hcl solution followed by subsequent addition of ti3alc2 and etching at ambient temperature 35 the mixture after etching was ultrasonic centrifuged for the solid liquid separation followed by final drying surface modification of mxene based adsorbents is a good approach for improving the pollutants uptake performance the amino functionalized ti3c2tx nanosheets were synthesized by the alkalization grafting method 36 before grafting ti3c2tx is made alkalized for obtaining oh groups and the hydroxide radicals then formed covalent bonds via dehydration reaction after interacting with the produced silanol groups intermolecular hydrolysis fig 1c illustrates the synthesis route of mxene polyethylenimine pei modified sodium alginate sa aerogel mpa through the cross linking reaction between the pei and amino functionalized ti3c2tx into sa aerogel matrix 37 the functionalization of the mxene surface could also affect its physicochemical properties and adsorption characteristics fig 2a depicts the preparation of biosurfactant functionalized ti2ctx 38 first the ti2ctx was prepared through the al etching of ti2alc second the etched sample was bath sonicated under argon atmosphere and centrifuged to obtain supernatant containing monolayer ti2ctx third a biosurfactant solution was added to the ti2ctx supernatant stirred and freeze dried to obtain the biosurfactant functionalized ti2ctx powder in the same way the fabrication of amino functionalized mxenes nh2 ti3c2tx was completed in several steps first of all raw ti3c2tx was prepared via an exfoliation process 39 in the second step functionalization of the already synthesized ti3c2tx powder was performed where 1 0 g of ti3c2tx was added to 30 ml of ethanol and 10 ml of di water 1 ml of 3 aminopropyl triethoxysilane aptes was added to the suspension and stirred filtered washed and dried at 40 c in a vacuum oven fig 2b represents the synthesis route of nh2 ti3c2tx 39 the dried product nh2 ti3c2tx was finally ground to powder and stored in vacuum for further applications fig 2c portrays the multi step synthesis route of nanoscale zero valent iron alkalized mxene nzvi alk ti3c2tx composites the nzvi alk ti3c2tx was prepared with three different fe alk ti3c2tx mass ratios of 3 1 1 1 and 1 2 40 first of all ti3c2tx nanoflakes were obtained via in situ hf etching using lif hcl method followed by ultrasonication and centrifugation a fixed amount 0 5 g of the prepared ti3c2tx was dispersed in a 50 ml solution of 1 m naoh and the mixture was stirred under an n2 atmosphere and washed with ultrapure water to obtain alk ti3c2tx the reduction of fecl2 4h2o with nabh4 in alk ti3c2tx under the n2 atmosphere then yielded nzvi alk ti3c2tx similarly the fabrication process of imidazoles mxene hybrid ti3c2 imiz composites is presented in fig 2d 41 in the first step etching of ti3alc2 was completed by treating its fixed amount 2 g with 30 ml hf solution then stirred and dried the raw product was further intercalated with anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide dmso for 24 h at 70 c followed by multiple centrifugations with ethanol and distilled water and freeze drying in the next step amino groups on ti3c2 were introduced via radziszewski reaction using raw reagents such as chitosan acetic acid methylglyoxal and formaldehyde the choice of synthesis and modification methods would strongly influence the characteristics of mxene based adsorbents and their performance in removing heavy metal ions in the aqueous phase 3 physicochemical properties of mxene based adsorbents the presence of diverse functional groups high specific surface area and tunable surface chemistry makes mxenes the ideal candidates to be employed in water treatment processes 42 the synthesis routes of mxenes often had an impact on the physicochemical characteristics of its compounds that in turn affect their adsorption potentials various functional groups e g oh o and f often develop on the surface of mxenes during etching procedures 25 similarly increasing the immersion time and temperature and reducing the particle size of the ti3alc2 often led to the faster conversion of ti3alc2 to ti3c2 29 likewise the alk mxene not only had a large number of oh and ona but also obtained additional nh2 via aptes treatment 36 the high specific surface area and improved adsorption capacity of amino functionalized ti3c2tx alk mxene nh2 nanosheets were obtained due to the improved characteristics of mxenes after alkalization grafting modification 36 43 similarly the presence of oh coo and ch groups of biopolymer alginate mx sa4 20 also played a vital role in the adsorption of hg ii ions 44 literature also reported the transformation of surface functional groups during synthesis and modifications of mxene based materials in the case of 2d alk mxene ti3c2 oh ona x f2 x material after exfoliation the exposed ti surfaces are terminated by f or oh groups and the partial f groups transform to oh that in turn change to ona after alkalization 45 the pb ii adsorption is more linked to hydroxyl groups and the intercalation of an oxygen atom with ti3c2 is much stronger compared to the oxygen of hydroxyl in ti3c2 o2h2 2m pb m similarly the surface functionalization of pristine ti3c2 with ionic liquid il resulted in more active sites on the ti3c2 imiz surface which in turn resulted in its higher adsorption performance 41 similarly the hydroxyl functional groups are also formed on the surface of the intercalated mxene that acts as the key binding positions for the metal cations specific surface areas and surface properties are the physicochemical characteristics of adsorbents that had a strong influence on their adsorption capabilities a study measured the bet specific surface areas to be about 0 5 m2 g and 67 66 m2 g for the multilayer ml ti3c2tx and delaminated dl ti3c2tx respectively 46 this large difference is attributed to the delamination of mxene into one or a few sheets that resulted in enhanced specific surface area the improved adsorption capacity 93 mg g of nh2 ti3c2tx 0 5 compared to pristine ti3c2tx 56 2 mg g for cr vi ions is due to the improved surface characteristics of nh2 ti3c2tx 39 further increasing the aptes content yielded a lower capacity of nh2 ti3c2tx 1 0 up to 54 mg g due to a sharp drop in its specific surface area 8 6 m2 g therefore nh2 ti3c2tx 0 5 nanosheets possess the maximum cr vi adsorption due to its net positive surface and appropriate specific surface area in a similar study the specific surface area of pristine ti3c2tx was calculated to be about 68 39 m2 g which was reduced to 56 51 m2 g for the magnetic titanium carbide ti3c2tx fe2o3 mxene hybrid nanocomposites mgmx due to the grafting of fe2o3 nanoparticles on ti3c2tx surface 47 likewise the stability of mxenes is mainly dependent on the synthesis conditions amount of surface terminations sheet quality and the degree of exfoliation the mxene stability could be enhanced by its surface modifications and appropriate storage in oxygen free degassed water or dry air besides storage in a chilled environment or in dry conditions under vacuum could also assist in slowing down the oxidation of colloidal mxene solutions 42 mxenes ti3c2tx powders are thermally stable at temperatures below 200 c in an o2 containing environment and up to 800 c under an argon ar atmosphere ti3c2tx undergoes surface oxidation at 200 c in an oxygen environment to anatase tio2 and amorphous carbon 42 48 49 the first step in the mxene degradation mechanism is the oxidation of the mxene surface to form anatase crystals that could protect the unreactive mxene from oxidation while the second step implicates the progressive oxidation of residual mxene at elevated temperature because of the expedited o2 diffusion through the anatase till transformation of all mxene to co2 tio2 and the anatase to rutile 49 4 adsorption of heavy metals the removal of toxic metal ions from the aqueous phase is a necessary step in treating toxic effluents as it severely affects the living organisms mxene based adsorbents exhibited outstanding adsorption potentials for the removal of toxic heavy metals from the water environment 50 51 table 1 presents a summary of published literature on the applications of mxenes derived adsorbents for the removal of heavy metals from water the adsorption capacity adsorption mechanism regeneration potential experimental conditions and surface characteristics of mxene based adsorbents are highlighted the adsorbents performed well in a diverse ph range from 2 to 11 but in most cases the optimum adsorption potential was measured at a ph range of 3 7 similarly room temperature rt was used in most of the reported studies these reflect the useful applications of adsorbents in the natural environment under normal conditions the mechanisms of toxic heavy metal ions removal include chelation chemical coordination chemisorption diffusion electrostatic interactions ion exchange physisorption reductive adsorption surface complexation and van der waals interactions 5 key influencing parameters 5 1 ph solution ph is a crucial factor that affects both the surface charge and the heavy metal ions distribution and often leads to electrostatic interactions between the nanomaterial and pollutants 31 a study described the critical effect of the initial ph value of the solution in a limited range 2 6 on the pb ii remediation by mxene where divalent cations were transformed to neutral or monovalent pb oh i and pb oh 2 at higher ph values 7 52 therefore a significant improvement in pb ii uptake was noticed with a rise in ph from 2 to 6 the point of zero charge phpzc value is important since they help in determining the net surface charge of the adsorbents generally at ph phpzc the adsorbent surface becomes negatively charged and therefore display favorable adsorption against cationic pollutants in case when ph phpzc the adsorbent surface is net positive which helps in the preferred adsorption of anionic pollutants a study reported the phpzc of dl ti3c2tx to be 2 7 and therefore the surface of the nanosheets was negatively charged at ph 2 7 thus promoting the electrostatic attraction between the cu ii ions and the adsorbent surface 46 the zeta potential value of mgmx at ph 9 was measured to be about 30 mv clearly describing its electrostatically stable nature 47 the same adsorbent exhibited poor removal efficiency of 18 70 in an acidic environment ph 2 which is attributed to ionic repulsion between the net positive mgmx nanocomposite and the metal cations the removal efficiency and adsorption capacity abruptly enhanced to 91 46 and 43 91 mg g with a rise in ph value to 3 5 because of the changes in surface charges of the nanocomposite however the adsorbent exhibited a slow rise in hg ii uptake in the ph range of 3 5 6 and observed maximum uptake performance 47 46 mg g and 98 89 at ph 6 followed by a reduction in adsorption potential of the mgmx nanocomposite with a further rise in ph from 6 to 9 due to hg ii complexation similarly the phpzc of the mgmx adsorbent was 3 2 and therefore the adsorbent surface would exhibit a positive charge by adsorbing h ions from acidic solution at ph 3 2 resulting in electrostatic repulsion between the metal cations and positively charged nanocomposite 47 however at ph 3 2 the presence of a large number of hydroxyl ions is responsible for the electrostatic attraction of the negatively charged adsorption sites and metal cations that led to the enhanced adsorption capacity of the employed adsorbent fig 3a represents the combined effect of temperature and ph on hg ii adsorption by the mx adsorbent 35 the optimum hg ii uptake was obtained at ph values near 4 5 35 fig 3b exemplifies the values of initial solution ph after adsorption and phpzc 2 03 of the modified mxene mx adsorbent before adsorption 35 therefore the mx surface is negatively charged when the ph value exceeds 2 03 thus higher ph values of the solution are more advantageous to electrostatic adsorption of hg ii ions fig 3c shows the inverse effect of solution ph on the adsorption capacities of mxene and mxene based composites for cr vi ions the maximum adsorption capacity of 96 7 mg g was attained for the nh2 ti3c2tx 0 5 at ph 2 3 39 this adverse behavior is attributed to the majority of hcro4 anions under acidic conditions and the electrostatic attraction between these anions and abundant protonated amino groups of nh2 ti3c2tx enhanced the uptake capacity a study also explored favorable adsorption of cr vi by the 2d ti3c2tx nanosheets in both acidic and neutral environments however its removal efficiency was reduced in the basic environment 53 this is due to the fact that protonation occurs in strongly acidic environments because of the electrostatic attraction between adsorbent and pollutant ions the dominant form of cr vi is hcro4 at solution ph range 2 6 and cro2 4 when ph is higher than 6 this means that electrostatic repulsion is the key factor behind lower cr vi uptake at a higher ph value of the solution precipitation of pollutants at higher ph could also inversely affect the adsorption potential of mxene derived adsorbents the pb ii adsorption onto the dl ti3c2tx was also found to be ph depended as the adsorbent exhibited lower adsorption at lower values of solution ph this is attributed to the competition between the pollutants and h ions for gaining access to the surface sites 46 the possible hydroxyl terminal protonation on nanosheet surfaces makes it positively charged in a strongly acidic environment the adsorption capacity and removal efficiency increased up to 39 24 mg g and 79 respectively with an improved initial value of solution ph from 2 to 5 however at ph values beyond 5 these values started downward trends this inverse behavior is attributed to the cu ii precipitation into cu oh 2 at a ph higher than 5 5 2 effect of temperature temperature is another parameter affecting the adsorption rate of toxic metal ions by the mxene derived adsorbents a study reported improved pb ii adsorption with an increase in solution temperature from 293 k to 313 k because of increased pb ii diffusion onto the mxene and a reduced boundary layer thickness of mxene 52 54 fig 3d shows a slight increase in cu ii uptake by the ti3c2tx nanosheets with a rise in temperature and the maximum adsorption capacity of 43 34 mg g was obtained at 318 k 46 the combined effect of temperature and ph on hg ii adsorption by the mx adsorbent is illustrated in fig 3a which shows the positive effect of temperature in the range of 10 30 c on hg ii adsorption 35 the adsorption capacity improved with a rise in temperature representing the endothermic nature of adsorption fig 3e describes a positive correlation of varying temperatures from 15 c to 55 c on the removal rate of ni ii by the alk mxene layered double metal hydroxide ldh adsorbent 55 however the elevated temperature is usually not preferred due to economic constraints 5 3 effect of contact time the adsorption of various toxic pollutants also depends upon how long the interactions between the adsorbate and adsorbent are going on generally the adsorption rate at the start of the process is quite fast due to the availability of vacant sites however the rate slows down after a certain time due to steering to pores saturation and there occurs no substantial change in adsorption potential once adsorption equilibrium is achieved a study reported the adsorption of cr vi by the 2d ti3c2tx nanosheets where the adsorption efficiency was fast during the initial stages due to the synergistic effects between the adsorbent and the pollutants in an aqueous environment 53 the saturation was achieved within 40 min because of the presence of electrostatic interactions ion exchange and complexation mechanisms and there appeared no substantial change after saturation of the employed adsorbent fig 3f represents the cr vi uptake performance of pristine ti3c2 and ti3c2 imiz adsorbents 41 for ti3c2 imiz the adsorption capacity rapidly enhanced to 66 91 mg g in the very first minute of adsorption followed by slow improvement to 111 31 mg g and reached a near saturation state after which the adsorption equilibrium was achieved in 80 min with adsorption capacity of 119 5 mg g 41 the somehow longer equilibrium contact time is due to the il functionalization of the ti3c2 adsorbent fig 4a illustrates the adsorption performances of ti3c2tx nh2 ti3c2tx 0 2 nh2 ti3c2tx 0 5 and nh2 ti3c2tx 1 0 against the elimination of cr vi 39 it is depicted from fig 4a that the adsorption capacities for both adsorbents significantly enhanced within the first 30 min followed by a slow rise on further growth in contact time and the adsorption equilibrium was achieved at 120 min 5 4 effect of adsorbent dosage adsorbent dosage is the most important factor in determining the adsorption potential of the employed adsorbents as it directly affects the adsorption rate increasing the adsorbent dosage often results in an improved adsorption rate but decreased adsorption capacity of an adsorbent towards potentially toxic metal ions this is because with increased adsorbent dosage under constant pollutants concentrations numerous adsorption sites could stay vacant which results in decreased adsorption capacities of adsorbents besides a high adsorbent amount could also result in overlapping of the binding sites for adsorption of lethal pollutants that in turn adversely affect the adsorption rate of toxic ions a study reported the effect of dl ti3c2tx dosage on its adsorption potential and there observed an increase in removal rate with improved adsorbent concentration from 0 1 g l to 1 5 g l 46 the adsorption efficiency abruptly enhanced from 48 to 97 when increasing the adsorbent amount from 0 1 g l to 1 5 g l the initial surge in cu ii removal rate is due to the availability of numerous vacant active sites that got occupied by the pollutants and reached a near saturation state after 1 g l adsorbent concentration fig 4b illustrates the effect of mxene chitosan cs dosage on the cr vi removal efficiency and the adsorbent capacity with increased dosage from 0 02 g l to 0 12 g l the adsorption capacity reduced from 30 5 mg g to 16 1 mg g while the removal efficiency improved from 12 9 to 40 5 56 the growth in removal efficiency is attributed to the availability of more contact surface area and numerous adsorption sites at higher adsorbent dosages while lower adsorption capacity might be the result of the limited amount of adsorbed cr vi per unit of adsorbent 5 5 effect of initial concentration of heavy metal ions the initial concentration of toxic heavy metal ions had a strong effect on the adsorption performance of mxene derived adsorbents generally with an increased concentration of heavy metal ions limited improvement in adsorption rate occurs due to the availability of a large number of pollutant ions to be adsorbed onto the easily accessible vacant sites on the adsorbent surface on further increasing the concentration of the heavy metals the adsorbent surface reached the saturation point and there happens no substantial variation in the adsorption potential of the adsorbent after the equilibrium is attained fig 4c illustrates the effect of varying cr vi concentration on the adsorption performance of mxene cs and shows the equilibrium adsorption capacity to be about 50 6 mg g 13 mg g and 10 10 mg g for the corresponding cr vi concentrations of 100 mg l 50 mg l and 20 mg l respectively this might have happened because higher pollutants concentration generated a concentration gradient that in turn affected the diffusional flow of heavy metal ions this in turn overcomes the mass transfer resistance of the heavy metal ions from the bulk solution to adsorb on the surface of the employed adsorbent while lower pollutant concentration might result in the availability of extra vacant sites left on adsorbent surfaces 57 5 6 effect of coexisting ions wastewater contains various pollutants such as common co ions like bicarbonates chlorides and sulfates that often led to competitive adsorption on the reactive sites on mxenes 53 a study reported a higher selectivity of nh2 ti3c2tx 0 5 nanosheets for cr vi adsorption in the presence of competing ions cl so4 2 cu2 fe3 and ni2 39 a contradictory approach was also studied where pb ii adsorption decreased with increased cationic strength in the order ca ii mg ii na i k i because of the competition between cations and pb ii ions 52 the hydrated ca ii radius 4 12 nm is closest to that of hydrated pb ii 4 01 nm thus it maximally reduced the pb ii uptake literature also described the use of the mixed solutions of competing ions such as cd ii cu ii ni ii and pb ii in assessing the selective adsorption of hg ii 35 the employed adsorbent exhibited a substantial removal rate almost 100 towards hg ii ions and pb ii and cu ii removal rates were observed to be about 50 and 7 59 respectively a study reported the effect of ca ii and mg ii ions on pb ii uptake by the alk mxene and compared its selective removal potential with a commercial polystyrene ion exchange resin 001 7 with sulfonic acid groups 45 the addition of competing ions ca ii and mg ii might affect the pb ii adsorption but overall the alk mxene exhibited remarkable adsorption behavior by increasing the number of competing ions the adsorption characteristics of alk mxene were slightly affected compared to that of 001 7 which reflects the selective adsorption feature of the mxene derived adsorbent the outstanding selectivity of the alk mxene adsorbent is mainly due to the rich surface groups that favors the interactions of pb ii ions with the surface of alk mxene 45 it is clear from fig 5a that the cr vi uptake is hardly affected by the presence of coexisting anions br cl so4 2 and co3 2 when their concentrations were quite lower about 0 001 m and 0 01 m however the effect is dominant when the concentration of the anions reached 0 1 m 37 this result happened due to the competitive interactions between the chromium species cr2o7 2 cro4 2 and hcro4 and the coexisting anions for the corresponding active sites on the surface of the employed adsorbent mpa 10 with pei mass of 5 0 g besides the presence of 0 1 m co3 2 could also improve the solution ph to a larger extent that weakened the adsorbent s protonation process thus weakening the electrostatic attractions between the toxic metal ions and the adsorbent fig 5b depicts the better selectivity of cr vi adsorption in the presence of coexisting cations where the pollutant removal was only slightly influenced due to the occupation of some of the vacant active sites by the existing cations 37 such studies demonstrated that mxene based adsorbents have the potential to selectively adsorb the toxic metal ions from water and can be employed in real water treatment systems in future 6 adsorption mechanism in order to have a detailed analysis of the adsorption of potentially toxic elements mechanism studies should be assessed various spectroscopic techniques adsorption isotherms and kinetics and theoretical calculations such as density functional theory are necessary to be carried out so as to have an idea about the exact probable uptake mechanism the abundant reaction sites and surface functional groups of novel nanomaterials would assist in the efficient elimination of heavy metal ions 31 the commonly reported mechanisms of toxic heavy metal ions removal include chelation chemical coordination chemisorption diffusion electrostatic interactions ion exchange physisorption reductive adsorption surface complexation and van der waals interactions fig 6 fig 7a illustrates a three step cr vi uptake mechanism onto the ti3c2 tio2 composites in an acidic environment the concentration of h ions in solution and positive charge on the adsorbent surface is higher which electrostatically attracts the negatively charged cr2o7 2 however this activity is reduced under basic conditions increased ph 58 the cr2o7 2 then started reduction with the help of h ions when in contact with the adsorbent surface the last step is the formation of ti o cr iii and then ti c cr iii as a result of fixing attaching the reduced cr iii moieties to the tio2 surface through a covalent bond with the tio bond similarly the proposed ni ii removal mechanism by the alk mxene ldh under weak acidic conditions is shown in fig 7b where the adsorbed heavy metal ni ii would form the coordination complex or precipitate at the surface of the base mxene ldh 55 the complex formation electrostatic interactions and ion exchange were the dominant adsorption mechanisms of hg ii adsorption onto the mx sa4 20 44 the inner surface complexation and ion exchange between the tio h and hg ii and between the ca ii and hg ii were responsible for hg ii confiscation 44 similarly fig 7c exemplifies the cr vi uptake mechanism by the nh2 ti3c2tx 0 5 nanosheets 39 in the first the amino groups nh3 nh2 could preferentially adsorb the cr vi ions reduction of cr vi to cr iii also takes place and cr vi along with the cr iii is adsorbed onto the nh2 ti3c2tx 0 5 surface the adsorption mechanism of cr vi by the ti3c2tx nanosheets is illustrated in fig 7d 59 the major steps involved are reduction of cr vi to cr iii electrostatic interactions between the adsorbent surface and the negatively charged cr2o7 2 in an acidic environment and precipitation of cr oh 3 at ph 4 8 59 certain characterization tools could also help in exploring the uptake mechanisms the sem and tem analyses of the alk mxene ldh pointed to the presence of adsorbed fine nanoparticles compounds or complexes containing ni ii on the layered surface of the composite adsorbent 55 another study analyzed after adsorption ftir analysis whose large shifts in peaks of tio band pointed to the manifestation of strong affinities between tio and pb ii ions that might result from the formation of inner sphere complex onto the alk mxene surface 45 similarly sem xps and other simulation measurements showed the possibilities of chemisorption rather than physisorption in another study according to the zeta potential measurement of the mx surface the material surface contains a large amount of negative charge and therefore part of hg ii was adsorbed by the electrostatic action similarly fesem micrographs exhibited the presence of adsorbed mercuric ions 35 the proposed interaction mechanism of mercury nitrate and mercury chloride on the mx surface is depicted in fig 7e 35 7 regeneration of mxene based adsorbents the possibility of recovering heavy metal ions from the loaded mxene based adsorbents and their reusability is a necessary step in controlling the cost of the adsorbent environmental threats and the toxic sludge disposal problem literature reported the applications of diverse eluents like hcl hno3 nh4oh h2so4 na2co3 naoh koh di water and na2edta for desorption of adsorbed pollutants by the mxene derived adsorbents table 1 a study explained the recyclability of mos2 mx ii adsorbent where the hg ii desorption was observed to be about 37 3 against 5 m hcl eluent after 3 h contact time however the desorption was improved to 55 with increased contact time up to 30 h 60 regardless of the longer contact time and high concentration of eluent the adsorbent mos2 mx ii exhibited better performance even at low hg ii concentration 0 08 mm after five cycles fig 8a 60 another study reported the regeneration study of mxene alginate composite by the application of 0 1 m hno3 with better adsorption stability till ten adsorption desorption cycles 61 the cross linked composite exhibited better adsorption performance compared to uncross linked composite throughout all the regeneration cycles however the adsorption rate reduced significantly for the uncross linked mxene alginate composite after four stages this occur because the cross linked composite with calcium ions had high structural stability compared to the pristine composite and therefore its adsorption loss rate for cu ii and pb ii were observed to be 5 4 and 8 9 after ten regeneration stages in the case of uncross linked composite this rate was 12 7 and 13 1 for the cu ii and pb ii respectively similarly cr vi desorption from the loaded ti3c2 imiz was performed by treating the composite with naoh eluent followed by di water and about 76 71 relative removal ratio was observed 41 this reduction in adsorption potential occurred owing to the mass loss of adsorbent and barring of active sites on the surface due to cr iii irreversibility the regeneration performance of ni ii loaded alk mxene ldh composite after regeneration with ammonium hydroxide solution is displayed in fig 8b 55 it is observed that by increasing the nh4oh concentration from 0 01 m to 1 0 m the ni ii desorption rate also improved the employed composite adsorbent exhibited a slight reduction in its adsorption potential after successive adsorption desorption stages due to a decrease in adsorbent concentration after multiple washing and incomplete desorption of heavy metal ions fig 8c illustrates the nine adsorption desorption stages of mx against the confiscation of hg ii 35 the removal rate of hg ii slightly reduced from 99 8 to 96 3 after nine regeneration cycles and only 3 5 loss was observed for hg ii for the fifth cycle compared to the first regeneration stage 35 fig 8d presents the reusability performance of mpa 10 till five consecutive adsorption desorption cycles where the drop in adsorption capacity was observed after the fifth cycle 37 these studies suggest that the mxene based adsorbents can be employed effectively as they not only exhibited excellent potential for the removal of heavy metals but also met the requirements for recycling and metal ions recovery 8 challenges and future prospects though the mxene based adsorbents exhibited high reusability enhanced stability and remarkable adsorption potential against the elimination of toxic heavy metal ions in water treatment technologies still numerous challenges require careful attention and therefore need to be addressed the major hurdles and directions for future research are summarized below the synthesis methods of mxenes can be improved to obtain the final structures with desired characteristics for specific applications furthermore the applications of toxic chemicals such as hf in the synthesis of mxenes have serious environmental and health concerns although there is some progress in the hf free synthesis of mxenes still the development of novel facile and efficient strategies are desirable applications of green chemistry can lead to the development of a synthesis route with less usage of toxic chemicals or alternate green chemicals can be employed to produce mxenes lab scale synthesis techniques of mxene and its derived adsorbents are expensive and the yield is also low hence future work should emphasize more on the development of more effective ways for synthesizing mxene nanocomposites on a larger scale at moderate cost the applications of mxene based adsorbents in real wastewater are limited the reported studies in the literature are performed on a lab scale under controlled environmental conditions for these materials to be the next generation materials for various applications the potential of these materials on a commercial scale under real conditions should be assessed the detailed mechanisms of confiscation of heavy metal ions from the water environment need to be explored in this regard different characterization tools and theoretical models may be employed regeneration of the loaded mxene derived adsorbents is a good step in determining the efficacy economic and stability of the employed adsorbents therefore special attention is needed towards various eluents applied for the desorption of adsorbed metal ions the use of alternative green eluents compared to acidic alkalis and basic eluents need to explore on behalf of the environmental perspective ti3c2 is the most widely used structure in water treatment however due to the presence of a large number of structures in this family the potential of other mxenes structures beyond ti3c2 should also be explored in water treatment other alternative applications of mxene derived composites such as light trapping ability faster charge transfer rate electromagnetic shielding energy storage photo electrochemical catalysis etc need comprehensive exploration in detail the vast potential of mxene nanocomposites in applications other than water purifications should also explore to analyze its diverse applications another major challenge is the stability and storage of mxenes mxenes due to their oxidative nature could oxidize easily in an aqueous environment therefore their long term storage without degradation should be resolved to fully explore the potential of these materials in various applications lastly the potentially toxic and environmental effects of these materials should be explored to safeguard human health and the environment 9 conclusion this review aimed to critically assess the latest innovations in applications of mxene based adsorbents to remediate potentially toxic metal ions from water mxene derived adsorbents have demonstrated remarkable adsorption potential for the confiscation of potentially toxic metal ions from an aqueous phase most of the mxene based adsorbents demonstrated higher adsorption capacity exceptional regeneration potential and excellent selectivity for the removal of desired metals from water however still several barriers exist that restrict their applications in practical water treatment systems despite all these hurdles the current research progress suggests that these 2d materials have the potential to dominate future energy storage water treatment and desalination technologies declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper
