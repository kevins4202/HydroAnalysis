16970,researchers and industrials need decision making tools to make informed decisions on environmental mitigation strategies and proceed with the overall ecodesign of processes in this study a tool that couples membrane filtration process modelling and life cycle analysis has been developed for which material and energy flows are calculated for variable operating conditions and are the basis for environmental impact assessment the resulting generic model has been applied to dead end ultrafiltration of ground and surface waters for drinking water production with cellulose triacetate hollow fibers operating strategies have been investigated to mitigate environmental impacts of the two major hotspots electricity and backwash cleaning chemical consumptions adjusting filtration cycle duration and filtration flux has shown to be a promising lever the developed model is sufficiently flexible and modular for its adaptation to other membrane materials filtration configurations i e cross flow as well as to other applications graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords process modelling environmental assessment membrane filtration hollow fiber cellulose triacetate drinking water 1 introduction as of the 1980s limitations of conventional drinking water production have led researchers to investigate on the use of membranes to treat ground and surface waters bersillon et al 1989 cabassud et al 1991 clark and heneghan 1991 jacangelo et al 1997 in 1988 the first ultrafiltration uf drinking water plant was inaugurated in france amoncourt 10 m3 h 1 nowadays membrane technology for drinking water applications is a mature technology notably owing to its compacity the physical nature of the treatment thereby limiting chemical inputs and formation of disinfection by products and more importantly the constant and high quality of water obtained the production target of drinking water plants entails an operation at constant flow rate and by extension a constant filtration flux l h 1 m 2 a near constant number of uf modules are indeed maintained in filtration mode to limit any downtime as ground or surface water is treated retained matter accumulates and fouls the membrane surface and its porous structure thereby increasing the driving force that is transmembrane pressure tmp membrane permeability falls keeping membrane permeability at an acceptable level in terms of energy consumption for pumping requires curative cleaning techniques the two principal ones carried out industrially being backwashing and cleaning in place chang et al 2017 regula et al 2014 backwashing is the mechanical action whereby a reversed flow is pumped from the permeate to the intake side of a membrane whereas cleaning in place consists in a chemical solution being pumped in the membrane module without displacing it from its rack these techniques not only consume water and chemicals but also energy for pumping membrane performances i e permeability water recovery rate depend on the quality of input water to be filtered in particular the complexity of fouling as a phenomenon arises in part from the complex matrix of input water particulate and colloidal matter have been identified as major foulants that remain loosely attached on the membrane surface and can therefore be easily removed by hydraulic washing procedures howe and clark 2002 peiris et al 2010 more problematic foulants are those that are tightly bound to the membrane typically natural organic matter fractions and thus require chemical action for their removal mallevialle et al 1996 interactions between foulants add to the complexity of fouling particulate and organic matter interactions have for example been documented to form a combined fouling layer and calcium ions to cross link with negatively charged functional groups present in organic matter alresheedi et al 2019 peldszus et al 2011 jermann et al 2008 with the ever increasing awareness of environmental issues research efforts on drinking water production have transcended purely technical considerations and have begun to focus on the environmental footprint of production processes environmental assessment tools are necessary for this a notable example being life cycle assessment lca this internationally recognized and standardized tool consists of four interdependent phases iso 2006 firstly the lca goal and scope are defined then material and energy flows from and to the environment are listed and quantified in a life cycle inventory lci in a third phase inputs and outputs previously identified are transformed into potential environmental impacts with life cycle impact assessment lcia methodologies in the final interpretation phase the first three phases are reviewed and improvement strategies as well as recommendations are made membrane based systems for drinking water production from ground and surface waters have been dealt with in lca studies notably with uf as the central unit of a treatment process chain friedrich 2001 igos et al 2014 as a pretreatment for nanofiltration ribera et al 2014 or polishing stage of a clarification sand filtration ozonation process vince et al 2008 see table 1 the environmental assessments are carried out at a process level and relative contributions of unit operations are identified for example vince et al 2008 point out that the uf operation is the greatest electrical consumer of the drinking water production process remineralization coagulation flocculation settling sand filtration ozonation activated carbon filtration uf chlorination dedicated to treat surface water with high organic content and low hardness to the best of our knowledge no information is found on how to specifically operate at a unit operation level including uf for environmental impact mitigation these studies are predominantly carried out under fixed site specific operating conditions as shown in table 1 exceptions consider variable operating conditions with limited values for example friedrich 2001 examines three design parameters i e membrane filtration flux module length and number of modules per rack each of which can have two different values the considered production process prefiltration uf chlorination produces 200 000 m3 of potable water per day from surface water results show a greater sensitivity of environmental impacts to filtration flux and module arrangement than module length vince et al 2008 go beyond specific cases and have developed black box models for drinking water unit operations to calculate the lci and output water characteristics from three types of input parameters equipment design e g type of membrane local conditions e g energy supply plant location and feed water characteristics i e quality flow rate unfortunately no further detail is given on model equations or the specific influence of operating conditions interestingly mery et al 2013 combined lca with process modelling for the ecodesign of conventional drinking water plants the developed tool is based on models of unit operations that calculate environmental impacts from design facts equipment sizing and operating conditions unit operations include coagulation granular activated carbon filtration and ozonation but membrane filtration has not been examined to the best of our knowledge such methodological approach has never been undertaken for membrane filtration in the field of drinking water production from ground and surface water in particular for ultrafiltration it is thus legitimate to consider that operating conditions have an influence on environmental impacts and can thus be an action lever to reduce them not only can existing drinking water plants go through upgrades but plants that are yet to be designed can be involved in such an ecodesign approach a second point is that cause effect relationships between operating conditions and environmental impacts are far from straightforward and are to be further investigated notably by taking into account the specificity and complexity of the system under study at a unit operation level for membrane filtration it would for example entail examining fouling and remediation methods what is ultimately pointed out is the relevance of going beyond specific cases and developing flexible and modular decision making tools that consider the unit operation level with the associated operating conditions the generic process modelling lca approach used in this study follows this objective given the complexity of fouling and its remediation this approach is applied to membrane filtration only in this work a previous study has considered membrane fabrication prézélus et al 2020 and membrane end of life is out of the scope the aims of this study are 1 to develop an original model and simulation tool of dead end uf as a unit operation for drinking water production 2 to evaluate the contribution of inputs and outputs on environmental impacts and 3 to assess the influence of operating conditions leading to possible improvements in the first part of our study the model development for dead end inside out hollow fiber filtration is explained and lca information is detailed in the second part a case study of the operation of cellulose triacetate cta uf membranes is examined 2 material and methods first of all the process and global framework of the model are explained along with the underlying model hypotheses all model equations are specifically given in appendix a focus is then given on lca information 2 1 process description the drinking water production process considered in this study concerns only the uf unit operation which consists in the succession of operating cycles i e alternation of filtration and backwash bw cycles concluded by a clean in place cip cycle the process can be described according to its three lines see fig 1 the uf line consists in input water transferred by the intake pump through the prefilter and uf modules into the permeate tank for storage input water either refers to ground and surface waters or water having undergone a previous pre treatment the uf modules are made up of inside out hollow fiber membranes operating in a dead end configuration in the bw line water is transferred by the bw pump from the permeate tank to the uf modules and prefilter with a reversed flow outside in a bw chemical is injected at the permeate tank outlet to avoid microbial proliferation in the uf modules the bw waste is decanted clear liquid is sent back to the prefilter and the sludge is sent to a wastewater treatment plant wwtp in the cip line several chemical solutions are first successively prepared in a cip tank with water from the permeate tank and injected cip chemicals these solutions are successively fed into the uf modules in the same direction as for filtration inside out liquid waste containing cip chemicals is sent to a wwtp whereas rinsing water from the final cip phase is discharged to a surface waterbody coelho et al 2019 environmental impacts in this study are calculated as a function of 1 m3 of ultrafiltered produced water which corresponds to a net volume after deduction of permeate water used up during backwashing and cleaning in place 2 2 model framework the model is valid for a hollow fiber membrane unit in a dead end configuration with a defined daily output water flow rate the model considers non stop membrane operation once the initial start up phase of the membrane unit is over membrane manufacturers indeed observe that permeability falls from an initial value e g ultra pure water permeability to a lower value noted lp1 1 1 in what follows due to the shift from ultra pure to more fouling real water inge 2014 the model calculates consumptions and waste and provides engineering design data relative permeability module operating life etc from both intrinsic and user defined input parameters see zoom on uf model in fig 2 as a first step these parameters are considered as constant over the module operating life intrinsic parameters are defined as imposed upon drinking water operators and plant designers such as the membrane fouling rate or thresholds defined by previous conducted research in particular the membrane fouling rate stems from choices made on membrane material operating conditions and input water quality operators and designers have no action on these input parameters unlike user defined parameters that can be changed and adapted on site or during design examples of user defined parameters include operating conditions and engineering design data e g number of modules their arrangement in blocks head loss input water quality can also be altered by adjusting the operation of upstream unit operations according to variable ground or surface water quality input parameters have been divided in this way to distinguish parameters that can be acted upon and serve as levers of action for operational and design strategies from parameters that cannot a detailed list of parameters is given in table 2 and the exhaustive list can be found in tables a 1 and a 2 in appendix a 2 2 1 intrinsic parameters 2 2 1 1 input water category and threshold operating conditions consideration of input water quality in the model is based on industrial practices due to the complexity of fouling and the difficulty to model it water suppliers have adopted a pragmatic approach of categorization so as to give guidance on how to conduct uf as a function of input water quality input water can be categorized according to two global easy to measure analytical parameters that have shown to be discriminating as regards fouling turbidity and total organic carbon toc coelho et al 2019 for example category 0 corresponds to high quality input water with low levels of turbidity and toc whereas category 3 corresponds to low quality input water with high turbidity and toc values each input water category is associated with recommended threshold operating conditions i e filtration flux bw and cip frequency specific to each water supplier and derived from industrial case studies in accordance with these industrial practices the definition of input water categories is inserted as intrinsic parameters of the model other intrinsic parameters are the three associated thresholds maximum filtration flux minimum bw and cip frequencies user defined parameters and model calculations must never exceed these thresholds 2 2 1 2 intrinsic parameters fouling rate and remediation efficiencies the model and in particular relative permeability variations hinges on three key intrinsic parameters fouling rate during filtration cycles bw efficiency and cip efficiency in this work the fouling rate during filtration vf is defined as the decline rate of relative permeability lp l p 1 1 1 f per unit of permeate volume v per membrane surface area s and expressed in m 1 1 v f d lp l p 1 1 1 f d v s by way of reminder lp1 1 1 is the permeability once the initial start up phase of the membrane unit is over an interesting feature of fouling rate described as in equation 1 is to eliminate dependency on filtration flux thereby lowering the number of degrees of freedom indeed for a given membrane material there is one fouling rate value per input water quality when both filtration flux and input water quality are held constant the fouling rate per unit of permeate volume can be readily converted to a fouling rate per unit of time as illustrated in fig 3 a bw efficiency bw is defined as the ratio of relative permeability recovery during a bw cycle δ lp l p 1 1 1 bw to relative permeability decline between the start and end of the preceding filtration cycle δ lp l p 1 1 1 f cip efficiency cip is defined as the ratio of relative permeability recovery during a cip cycle δ lp l p 1 1 1 cip to relative permeability decline between the start of the ongoing operating cycle and the start of the cip cycle δ lp l p 1 1 1 op see fig 3 b in a first approach all three intrinsic parameters are assumed to be constant studies have highlighted the variability over time of membrane properties and process behaviour including cip efficiency porcelli and judd 2010 cip efficiency can increase over time due to more permeable membranes as a result of their chemical degradation during cip amplified by mechanical stress of bws pellegrin et al 2013 it has also been hypothesized that the chemical ageing of membranes account for a greater sensitivity to fouling compared to virgin membranes touffet et al 2015 such opposite effects of membrane ageing on permeability make it difficult to quantitatively predict the evolution of parameters such as fouling rate bw or cip efficiencies integrating such effects in the model would require a complete dataset of tmp over time of the uf unit by default bw and cip efficiencies have been initialized with parameters having true constant values membrane operating life initial and final permeabilities industrial values can readily be found in the literature bersillon et al 1989 clark et heneghan 1991 coelho et al 2019 mallevialle et al 1996 the fouling rate can then be inferred from the bw and cip efficiencies another possible approach beyond the scope of this study would be to implement a statistical analysis to process large sets of industrial or laboratory data teychene et al 2018 which could result in regression functions suggested for the three intrinsic parameters as a function of input water quality e g turbidity toc membrane characteristics and operating conditions e g bw and cip conditions a prerequisite for this semi empirical approach is access to a large set of industrial values over a long period of time e g a year results from such an analysis as well as those from specific research studies on membrane ageing for example can be later integrated in the developed model 2 2 1 3 intrinsic parameters end of life thresholds the end of life of any given membrane module is reached when at least one of four conditions has been met maximum operating life minimum productivity maximum chemical resistance and maximum mechanical resistance the last three conditions imply membrane ageing note should be taken that it can be difficult to distinguish between chemical and physical ageing of membranes since consequences on membrane performances e g permeability may be similar rouaix et al 2006 maximum operating life corresponds to a defined duration that has been reached this duration can for example correspond to the membrane manufacturer s warranty after which breakdowns are not insured anymore or to the membrane manufacturer s recommendation to systematically renew modules after a given period of time for precautionary measures in the case of minimum productivity a defined permeability is reached after a bw cycle below this minimum permeability the module is considered unproductive unless an unacceptably high tmp is applied in this study the maximum chemical resistance corresponds to a defined c x t value that has been reached for one of the chemicals used for backwashing or cleaning in place it expresses the chemical intensity in ppm day and corresponds to the chemical s concentration c multiplied by the contact time t with the membrane surface to maintain the chemical integrity of the membrane and the module as a whole a maximum tolerable number of cip cycles is determined for each chemical arkhangelsky et al 2008 levitsky et al 2012 mallevialle et al 1996 as for maximum mechanical resistance a defined number of bw cycles has been reached bws have an effect on the physical integrity of membranes a maximum number of bw cycles is thus defined to stop operating modules before fibers are too fragile to mechanical stress mallevialle et al 1996 2 2 2 user defined parameters as shown in fig 2 user defined parameters are inputs of the model the output flow rate is defined as the average daily output flow rate and accounts for permeate loss during backwashes bws and clean in places cips following industrial practices and as explained in section 2 2 1 turbidity and toc are considered in the model as user defined parameters for input water quality characterization both are average values during the membrane facility s operating life which provides the advantage in a first approach to smooth the effect of temporary variations of input water quality operating conditions include filtration flux bw conditions i e flux permeate volume per unit of membrane surface chemical concentration and injection time fraction and cip conditions i e chemical concentration filtration and soaking duration and filtration and rinsing fluxes module characteristics refer to the membrane filtration surface initial permeability and void volume to be filled during cips pumping system characteristics include pump efficiencies pipe dimensions and minor loss coefficients of the pumping system pipes common to all blocks prefilter and pipes within a rack 2 2 3 model calculations in order to calculate consumptions and waste the model is based on the determination of relative permeability variations during the modules operating life relative permeability compares permeability at any given time to lp1 1 1 the initial permeability the latter varies from one module to another and from one membrane material to another thus making it difficult to compare absolute permeability values of modules with one another relative permeability allows this comparison to be made membrane modules are considered to respond in an equivalent manner to given operating conditions permeability variations and operating lifespan are for example identical from one module to another in the same membrane unit in reality there may be modules of different ages due to module replacement for example if too many broken fibers are present brehant et al 2009 the behaviour of modules calculated by the model corresponds to an average behaviour in the uf unit similarly hydraulic distribution in the piping system is never perfectly equal and hydraulic conditions may vary from one module to another depending on their position in the membrane unit due to lower head losses modules closest to the intake pump are subject to input water at a higher tmp than the furthest modules however it can be considered that hydraulic variations between membrane units are similar and hydraulic conditions given by the model corresponds to average conditions in the membrane facility module consumption may be derived from the number of modules needed to satisfy the daily output water flow rate and the operating life chemical consumption during cips and head loss both depend on module arrangement in blocks the module arrangement in the model is based on industrial practices according to which the membrane system is composed of several identical blocks two racks of two rows each containing the same number of modules an example of a possible module arrangement is given in appendix b energy consumption linked to pumping in part depends on the membrane facility s configuration and inherent minor head losses linear head loss is neglected in pumping calculations because negligible compared to minor head loss as an order of magnitude linear head loss is at most a tenth of minor head loss for rack lengths smaller or equal to 14m which corresponds to 80 modules per rack module diameter and space between modules are equal to 30 and 5 cm respectively racks are backwashed successively whilst the others remain in the filtration mode a first rack is cleaned then a second etc whereas material consumption of the bw chemical injection is taken into account its pumping is neglected in energy consumption calculations because negligible compared to bw water pumping 0 01 racks are also cleaned in place successively a cip cycle is composed of maximum 5 phases of which up to 3 phases consist in inside outside filtration with a chemical solution followed by a soaking period chemical injection in the cip tank is neglected in energy consumption calculations because negligible compared to tank filling with permeate water 0 9 in a fourth phase permeate water used in a closed circuit is filtered inside outside the fifth phase is a final rinsing step during which the permeate goes directly to waste further precisions on fluid circulation and rack rotations for bw and cip executions can be found in appendix c modelling equations used for consumption and waste calculation as well as engineering design data can be found in appendix a 2 3 life cycle assessment lca 2 3 1 goal and scope the goal of lca is to evaluate 1 the contribution of consumptions and generated waste on environmental impacts 2 the influence of operating conditions and 3 lever actions for improving environmental performances for our case study the uf unit is considered to be located in france and intended for drinking water production the functional unit is 1 m3 of ultrafiltered water the system boundaries consider membrane operation only including prefiltering ultrafiltering backwashing and cleaning in place see fig 1 energy and chemical consumptions are considered for these four unit processes transport of chemicals and waste from and to the uf unit and treatment of bw and cip liquid waste are also considered the fabrication and end of life of membranes are out of the scope of this study the former has been dealt with in one of our previous studies prézélus et al 2020 and the latter will be included in our forthcoming study the construction and decommissioning of infrastructure and equipment are not included in the environmental assessment indeed the modelling of each life cycle phase first needs to be developed before being able to consider the entire life cycle of membranes with the corresponding infrastructure umberto nxt software and ecoinvent 3 4 database are used with the allocation at the point of substitution for background processes i e energy production transportation chemicals production waste treatment etc 2 3 2 life cycle inventory lci the flowchart for lca calculation is presented in fig 2 the foreground is the uf drinking water production process as described in section 2 1 with input data collected from the scientific literature in this work the input data and the resulting modelled inventory are valid for an uf unit composed of cta hollow fiber modules operating in a french drinking water production context ideally a parametric model is needed to express the fouling rate of a given membrane as a function of at least turbidity and toc environmental assessments require that this model be based on industrial data from drinking water plants as opposed to theoretical or research data a considerable effort would then be needed to process data with advanced numerical tools e g artificial intelligence it was not possible to collect sufficient data to adjust such a parametric model due to the difficulty in obtaining such data which is sometimes confidential and due to the fact that drinking water plants do not always collect them in particular as regards bw and cip efficiency in such circumstances the literature has been used to obtain information for specific ranges and for different time spans of a membrane s operating life the choice has been made to verify the model of membrane operation by first defining a baseline scenario based on real data and then verifying the obtained inventory against literature values the baseline scenario has been defined as the dead end filtration at 100 l h 1 m 2 of a high quality input water i e 1 ntu 1 mg toc l 1 with cta hollow fibers having an initial permeability of 230 l h 1 m2 bar 1 the entire dataset of the baseline scenario is given in table 2 for this scenario literature values indicate a maximum membrane operating life i e 15 years and a minimum final productivity i e 100 l h 1 m2 bar 1 laîné et al 2000 for this scenario high remediation efficiencies i e 95 for both bw and cip have been suggested in consistency with the high quality input water the two values for bw cip along with the literature values allow to evaluate the fouling rate vf the fouling rate i e 7 9 10 3 m 1 actually corresponds to a decline in permeability equal to 0 18 l h 1 m2 bar 1 per filtration cycle of 60 min at 100 l h 1 m2 it should be pointed out that such a low permeability decline in a drinking water plant can only be detected over a significant number of filtration cycles which makes its validation from real data impossible in this context it was deemed relevant to have an order of magnitude of the percentage of fouled surface and to put it in perspective with the fouling rate its low value is in line with the low values of deposited turbidity and toc during a filtration cycle as defined in the baseline scenario 100 ntu and 100 mg per m2 of membrane surface respectively the turbidity deposit can be assimilated to 330 mg of bentonite dry density 2 500 kg m 3 particle size 4 µm which means that only 5 of the membrane surface is covered by bentonite particles at the end of a filtration cycle this is coherent with the high quality input water concerning the bw line it is considered that 100 of the bw waste is sent back to the prefilter the volume taken up by the sludge after decantation is supposed to be zero in the baseline scenario the full list of parameter values and their literature references are found in table 2 for sake of clarity input water quality categories and associated thresholds are provided in appendix a table a 6 2 3 3 life cycle impact assessment lcia two recognized evaluation methods are used to calculate environmental impacts with the lca software umberto nxt 1 ipcc s gwp100a that specifically evaluates the topical subject of climate change at midpoint units in kg co2 eq and 2 recipe endpoint method that consists in 17 impact categories e g agricultural land occupation human toxicity fossil depletion etc grouped in 3 areas of protection i e ecosystem quality human health and resource depletion units in points scores of these 17 categories can be aggregated into a unique score the hierarchist cultural perspective is taken as recipe default model 2 3 4 interpretation a sensitivity analysis of environmental scores of the baseline scenario is carried out on the electricity mix the nuclear based electricity taken as reference is compared to french renewable electricity sources hydropower wind biomass and solar the precise ecoinvent unit processes used are to be found in appendix d the sensitivity of environmental scores to variations in several parameters for membrane operation is also studied through scenarios and trends that can be identified the scenario based approach is based on the same premise as the lca approach developed in this work process oriented thinking for a realistic and physical representation of the studied system as such four plausible scenarios are elaborated based on the baseline scenario as a reminder the fouling rate bw and cip efficiencies in the baseline scenario have been adjusted by setting the membrane operating life and initial and final permeabilities in the four scenarios the fouling rate and remediation efficiencies are hypothesized based on the defined operating conditions and initial and final permeabilities module operating life is not set anymore but calculated values defined for operating conditions and permeabilities are within the ranges found in the literature see table 2 hypotheses need to be made on fouling rate and remediation efficiencies since no specific industrial or laboratory data is available qualitative information is however available in the literature that indicates the direction of change of these three intrinsic parameters as a function of operating conditions a greater bw efficiency for a greater bw flux nakatskuka et al 1996 a greater fouling rate for a lower quality input water mallevialle et al 1996 a greater cip efficiency for a greater cip chemical concentration bird bartlett 2002 scenario a considers an operating strategy whereby bw flux is increased from 250 to 300 l h 1 m 2 given that an asymptotic like behavior has been observed for bw efficiency increase with bw pressure nakatsuka et al 1996 kennedy et al 1998 the hypothesis of bw efficiency increasing from 95 to 97 makes sense in scenario b filtration flux is increased from 100 to 130 l h 1 m 2 the choice is made to adapt the filtration cycle duration from 60 to 46 min so as to maintain constant the deposited mass during a filtration cycle since filtration flux is multiplied by 1 3 filtration cycle duration is divided by 1 3 the relative permeability decline during a filtration cycle thus also remains the same and so does bw efficiency scenario c considers a degraded input water quality 2 mg toc l 1 thereby not only contributing to fouling but also making hydraulic removal by backwashing difficult alresheedi et al 2019 peiris et al 2010 peldszus et al 2011 teychene et al 2018 these observations lead to suggest a lower fouling rate i e 8 1 10 3 m 1 and bw efficiency i e 93 in scenario d the same conditions as those for scenario c are taken with the exception of a greater cip chemical concentration 3 instead of 1 5 g l 1 studies clearly indicate an influence of cip chemical concentration on cip efficiency bird and bartlett 2002 nigam et al 2008 väisänen et al 2002 hence the hypothesis of cip efficiency increasing from 95 to 97 values that differ between the four aforementioned scenarios and the baseline scenario are summarized in table 3 3 results 3 1 lci analysis and model verification the modelled inventory and the ecoinvent unit processes used for each input and waste treatment are given in appendix e in what follows calculated values found in this table are compared to literature values for model verification in particular for electricity consumption and liquid waste see table 4 it can be seen that the modelled value kwh for electricity consumption is consistently lower than literature values this is expected for friedrich s 2001 value range since it includes electricity consumptions of sand filtration and chlorination on top of uf which is moreover carried out in a cross flow configuration as opposed to the less energy intensive dead end filtration in our study glucina 1998 amongst the listed references lipp et al s 1998 conditions are the most similar to ours in terms of filtration configuration membrane material and filtration operating conditions the tmp is 28 higher than the average tmp of the baseline scenario 0 6 bar which in part explains that electricity values are 3 to 4 times greater than the modelled value kwh the remaining difference may come from the real life context of lipp et al s 1998 study most importantly as regards fluctuating input water quality real surface water was either sand filtered or microstrained before being used as input to the pilot scale ultrafiltration plant leading to varying fouling rate and permeability decline in contrast a constant input water quality is considered in the baseline scenario of our study more generally our study considers constant filtration flux and a lack of shutdowns the former model simplification removes pressure variations due to hydraulic shocks whilst the latter implies no extra electricity for pump restart as a result electricity consumptions are underestimated as opposed to real life measurements on pilot or industrial scale drinking water treatment plants such as those in chew et al s 2015 2016 and glucina et al s 1998 studies as regards igos et al s 2014 and liu and mauter s 2020 work absent details of operating conditions hinders complete analysis relatively low discrepancies are obtained for water recovery which is defined as the percentage of input water that leaves the uf unit as ultrafiltered water see table 4 the modelled value 95 2 is similar to those found by lipp et al 1998 and friedrich 2001 given this correct order of magnitude and that concentrations of chemicals i e sodium hypochlorite citric acid ammonia and sodium hydroxide are based on literature values see table 2 it can be inferred that modelled values for chemical consumption are also in the correct order of magnitude 3 2 impacts of the baseline scenario in the baseline scenario the operation of hollow fiber membranes for the production of 1 m3 of ultrafiltered water generates impacts amounting to 4 1 10 3 kg co2 eq and 4 5 10 4 points for ipcc gwp100a and recipe endpoint scores respectively process inputs and waste are grouped in clusters for the study of their respective contributions see appendix e the cluster cip chemicals for example aggregates citric acid ammonia and sodium hydroxide more than 99 of both ipcc gwp100a and recipe scores are attributable to the bw chemical and electricity production indeed bw chemical production contributes to 57 and 54 of ipcc gwp100a and recipe scores respectively electricity production contributes to 43 and 45 of respective scores see appendix f for further results in particular intake pumping accounts for the major part 90 of electricity consumption whereas bw pumping accounts for the remaining 10 the contribution of cip pumping to energy consumption is negligible these relative contributions are in line with the average tmp and cumulative duration of each operating mode filtration bw and cip it can further be noted that annual cleaning in place has very insignificant impacts 2 not only is pumping during cip phases negligible 0 01 compared to total electricity consumption but negligible impacts are also observed for cip chemicals and waste treatment the detailed recipe results are presented in fig 4 for all impact categories and by cluster three endpoint impact categories account together for around 70 of total endpoint impacts fossil depletion climate change for human health and climate change for ecosystem quality it is to be noted that climate change results with the recipe endpoint method correspond to damages expressed in points due to temperature elevation whereas ipcc gwp100a results consider radiative forcing to express climate change at midpoint in kg co2 eq for each impact category distributions between the clusters bw chemical and electricity are between 55 and 57 for the former and between 42 and 44 for the latter these distributions for specific recipe impact categories are similar to those for total recipe endpoint scores the dominant impacts of fossil depletion climate change particulate matter formation and ionizing radiation are correlated with each other since they correspond to impacts of energy production and consumption i e electricity used in the foreground process and energy used for chemical production the important contribution of electricity consumption in environmental results leads to ponder on the influence of the electricity source in this work the assumed ecoinvent unit process relates to a french electricity mix composed of 71 nuclear 10 hydropower 6 natural gas 4 wind 2 coal and 7 other including oil biomass biogas given the ongoing sustainable developments of the sector french renewable electricity sources are considered for a sensitivity analysis hydropower wind biomass and solar total life cycle ipcc gwp100a results are 40 36 20 and 10 respectively lower compared to that of the baseline scenario with french electricity mix total life cycle recipe endpoint results are 42 35 8 lower for system with hydropower wind and solar respectively compared to the system using french electricity mix total life cycle impacts are however 1050 greater for system with biomass cogeneration due to predominant impacts on urban land occupation this sensitivity analysis clearly points out the influence of the electricity mix on environmental impacts 3 3 influence of operating conditions as a reminder four scenarios are considered to study the sensitivity of environmental scores to variations of operating conditions see table 3 for parameter values for these four scenarios values of calculated parameters are coherent with changes in input parameters see appendix g for extensive values for scenario a the module operating life increases by 36 compared to the baseline scenario from 15 0 to 23 5 years due to increased bw efficiency by 2 the end of life condition is not the minimum permeability 100 l h 1 m 2 bar 1 anymore but the maximum number of bw cycles which has been reached and set at 200 000 this is the top value in the suggested range see table 2 without the end of life condition on mechanical resistance the module operating life would have been 37 9 years which is unrealistic in scenario a the final permeability equals 151 l h 1 m 2 bar 1 the filtration average permeability is thus greater than in the baseline scenario which in part explains the lower filtration average tmp 0 54 instead of 0 60 bar the second reason is the greater bw efficiency 97 instead of 95 meaning that there is more permeability recovery at the end of a bw cycle it follows that energy consumption falls sodium hypochlorite consumption remains constant however since injection conditions duration volume frequency of the bw chemical are the same in scenario a the change in bw flux impacts on the bw efficiency only not on the injected volume of sodium hypochlorite since the volume used during each bw cycle is unchanged cip chemical consumption varies by 4 5 since a cip occurs every 1 02 year 23 cips in 23 5 years compared to every 1 07 years for the baseline scenario 14 cips in 15 0 years for scenario b the number of modules is 192 compared to 252 in the baseline scenario and the average tmp during filtration rises from 0 60 to 0 79 bar these variations are proportional to the increased filtration flux the operating cycle duration i e cip frequency is also impacted and falls from 365 to 296 days whereas cips in the baseline scenario start when the maximum operating cycle duration is reached cips in scenario b start when the maximum relative permeability decline during an operating cycle is reached it has been defined as equal to 0 35 in all scenarios which is equivalent to a permeability of 150 l h 1 m 2 for the first operating cycle this threshold permeability is reached sooner in scenario b because the relative permeability decline of 7 9 10 4 during a filtration cycle occurs after 46 min only as compared to 60 min in the baseline scenario like for scenario a no change in sodium hypochlorite consumption is observed injection conditions are the same indeed sodium hypochlorite is still injected every 100 l m 2 even if backwashing occurs every 46 min instead of 60 min despite more frequent cips the consumption of cip chemicals decreases by 11 due to a lower number of blocks 4 instead of 7 and modules per row 12 instead of 9 on a per module basis the volume needed to fill pipes is reduced to 1 04 m3 in scenario c the operating life falls from 15 0 to 10 2 years due to decreased bw efficiency and fouling rate these unfavourable conditions first lead to shorter operating cycles 265 instead of 365 days like for scenario b the maximum relative permeability decline during an operating cycle is reached before the maximum operating cycle duration the greater cip frequency leads to a 37 increase in cip chemical consumption then the end of life condition of minimum permeability 100 l h 1 m 2 bar 1 is reached given that the initial and final permeabilities are the same as for the baseline scenario the filtration average tmp does not significantly change 0 60 bar in scenario d the increased cip efficiency offsets the decreased bw efficiency indeed the operating life i e 16 0 years is greater than in the baseline scenario and scenario c operating cycles still last 265 like in scenario c since values for the fouling rate and bw efficiency are identical cips start due to the maximum relative permeability decline during an operating cycle being reached as expected cip chemical consumption increases proportionally with respect to the cip chemical concentration from 1 5 to 3 0 g l 1 the question that arises now is whether these variations are significant from an environmental point of view environmental scores and contributions of cluster process inputs and waste for membrane operation only are very similar between scenarios a c and d and the baseline scenario percentage changes are 2 at the most see table 5 and fig 5 this is not surprising since average tmp during filtration bw frequency and duration are similar or identical it is furthermore known from model calculations that intake pumping contributes to more than 90 to electricity consumption and that the two clusters electricity and bw chemical are the greatest contributors to environmental scores not only are electricity and bw chemical consumptions similar between these scenarios water recovery rates are too i e 95 as shown in table 5 specific electricity and bw chemical consumptions are thus also similar maximum 5 7 of absolute difference unlike in scenario b it can be concluded that environmental scores are insensitive to the studied variations of vf bw cip in scenarios a c and d that is for a cut off of 2 in absolute values this should however not be generalized since other operating conditions could lead to these same variations of vf bw cip but to different environmental scores for example differences in final permeability and consequently in average tmp during filtration may be observed when the limiting end of life condition is different this is the case for scenario a for which the module operating life is determined by the maximum number of bw cycles moderate changes in environmental impacts are observed 2 in absolute values which could moreover be more significant if a threshold lower than 200 000 bw cycles were to be defined the filtration cycle duration in all three scenarios is also the same as in the baseline scenario changing this filtration cycle duration would impact on bw efficiency as well as on specific consumptions the influence of vf bw cip on environmental impacts should then be reassessed under these other operating conditions in short a first prerequisite is to determine precisely the end of life thresholds e g minimum permeability maximum number of bw cycles a second prerequisite is to determine the influence of filtration cycle duration on bw efficiency in scenario b a high sensitivity of environmental scores to changes in filtration flux and filtration cycle duration is observed depending on the considered evaluation method scores are 29 or 31 greater in scenario b compared to the baseline scenario see table 5 contributions of electricity production rise at the expense of bw chemical fabrication from 42 45 in the baseline scenario to 56 59 in scenario b it can be concluded that the influence of the increased filtration flux in scenario b is greater than that of the increased bw frequency regardless of the evaluation method or recipe endpoint impact category 3 4 analysis of global trends the study confirms that electricity and bw chemical production are two major points of interest for mitigating environmental impacts of the ultrafiltration stage with cta inside out hollow fibers mitigating impacts from bw chemical consumption can first of all consist in adjusting bw operating conditions i e injection time concentration to avoid overconsumption due to precautionary measures variations in environmental scores are sensitive to these adjustments for example halving the bw chemical concentration from 5 to 2 5 ppm in the baseline scenario decreases gwp100 and recipe endpoint scores by 29 and 27 respectively microbial proliferation prevention strategies can also be considered such as using better suited materials to biofouling for membrane and module components chemical compounds with a lower environmental footprint than sodium hypochlorite can also be investigated mitigation strategies related to electricity consumption can consist in fabricating more permeable and or low fouling membranes the initial permeability and fouling rate would respectively be higher and lower thereby providing a higher average permeability given that intake pumping accounts for the majority of electricity consumption in all considered scenarios i e a minimum of 88 for scenario b it is also particularly impactful to focus on filtration sequences when it comes to adjusting operating conditions in this respect the comparison between the baseline scenario and scenario b shows filtration flux as a relevant operating condition to act on the percentage variation in environmental scores is inversely proportional to the percentage variation in filtration flux the sensitivity analysis on the electricity mix also shows that using renewable energy sources especially hydropower and wind energy can mitigate environmental impacts to the same extent as lowering filtration flux by extension these two measures combined have the potential to halve these impacts provided necessary structural adaptations are made hydropower requires falling or fast running water near the drinking water plant as well as appropriate infrastructure wind energy requires favorable local conditions and its fluctuating nature implies using storage and or at least one controllable source of energy as for lower filtration fluxes the greater number of modules to be installed implies capital expenditure and extra floor area in the drinking water plant itself such changes if technically feasible call for long term planning whereas acting on bw chemical consumption can be based on simple trial and error tests followed by a swift implementation which seems adapted as a first line optimization strategy given limited resources as regards the developed model this study has showed that operating conditions have an influence on both process parameters and environmental impacts in particular the high sensitivity of module operating life and the number of filtration cycles to operating conditions see appendix g calls for a detailed knowledge of the three key intrinsic parameters fouling rate bw and cip efficiencies finding relevant and complete datasets of these parameters in the literature is compromised by the long time scale several years and the confidentiality of industrial values ideally tmp values over time for different qualities of input water could serve as a basis for a statistical analysis and modelling of these three parameters as a function of input water quality membrane material and operating conditions access and analysis of such data would represent an improvement over the pragmatic approach of associating threshold operating conditions to input water quality categories based on turbidity and toc the dependency of the number of modules and their operating life to operating conditions reveals that module consumption varies from one scenario to another the associated environmental impacts are related to the fabrication stage of the modules life cycle a previous study specifically considered a generic process modelling and lca approach for uf membrane fabrication prézélus et al 2020 although this stage is beyond the scope of this study taking it into account opens up prospects on the eco design of membrane modules on a life cycle scale new questions that arise are the relative impacts of fabrication operation and end of life and the key operating conditions of each stage for environmental mitigation the underlying objective is not only to ecodesign membrane filtration as a unit operation but to ecodesign sequences of unit operations making up an entire production process ultimately membrane based production processes can be compared from an environmental point of view to conventional ones and serve as criteria in the decision making of design for drinking water production from ground or surface water 4 conclusion the methodological novelty of this study whereby process modelling is coupled with lca is of importance for the scientific community since the influence of operating conditions on environmental impacts can be fully investigated and serve as a basis for impact mitigation the generic model that has been developed following this approach addresses the complexity and specificity of membrane operation especially regarding fouling and remediation methods variations of relative permeability are calculated from key model parameters i e fouling rate bw and cip efficiencies the model could moreover be improved by correlating these three parameters to relevant operating conditions such as input water quality bw and cip conditions a statistical analysis of a large dataset would be an appropriate tool the initial results obtained with the generic process modelling lca model put forth the predominant contributions of electricity production and bw chemical fabrication to gwp100a and recipe endpoint scores mitigation strategies include further reducing total dynamic head of the system and fine tuning bw operating conditions lca results also confirm that environmental impacts may be sensitive to changes in operating conditions notably when considering filtration flux and filtration cycle duration this demonstrates the relevance of such a parameterized model of the membrane operation stage as compared to conducting a lca with fixed operating conditions the flexibility and modularity of the developed generic model allow its use beyond the presented case study membrane materials other than cta can for example be examined by adapting values of material specific parameters such as initial permeability fouling rate and cip conditions the same holds for other applications such as direct filtration of low input water quality e g higher toc and turbidity with an online addition of a coagulant it would involve among other things new values for input water quality and thresholds associated with input water categories as well as the integration of the coagulant in the life cycle inventory the model could also be adapted to a cross flow configuration recirculation would need to be taken into account with an additional pump a modified piping system and included in input water quality calculations lastly other types of filtration e g microfiltration nanofiltration can be considered as regards the integration of environmental evaluation in membrane science and technology our model development for membrane operation is only but a first step since the same approach must be carried out on the other life cycle s stages namely membrane fabrication and end of life in this way it will be possible to fully ecodesign membranes by determining key mitigation parameters and strategies and compare membrane based

16970,researchers and industrials need decision making tools to make informed decisions on environmental mitigation strategies and proceed with the overall ecodesign of processes in this study a tool that couples membrane filtration process modelling and life cycle analysis has been developed for which material and energy flows are calculated for variable operating conditions and are the basis for environmental impact assessment the resulting generic model has been applied to dead end ultrafiltration of ground and surface waters for drinking water production with cellulose triacetate hollow fibers operating strategies have been investigated to mitigate environmental impacts of the two major hotspots electricity and backwash cleaning chemical consumptions adjusting filtration cycle duration and filtration flux has shown to be a promising lever the developed model is sufficiently flexible and modular for its adaptation to other membrane materials filtration configurations i e cross flow as well as to other applications graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords process modelling environmental assessment membrane filtration hollow fiber cellulose triacetate drinking water 1 introduction as of the 1980s limitations of conventional drinking water production have led researchers to investigate on the use of membranes to treat ground and surface waters bersillon et al 1989 cabassud et al 1991 clark and heneghan 1991 jacangelo et al 1997 in 1988 the first ultrafiltration uf drinking water plant was inaugurated in france amoncourt 10 m3 h 1 nowadays membrane technology for drinking water applications is a mature technology notably owing to its compacity the physical nature of the treatment thereby limiting chemical inputs and formation of disinfection by products and more importantly the constant and high quality of water obtained the production target of drinking water plants entails an operation at constant flow rate and by extension a constant filtration flux l h 1 m 2 a near constant number of uf modules are indeed maintained in filtration mode to limit any downtime as ground or surface water is treated retained matter accumulates and fouls the membrane surface and its porous structure thereby increasing the driving force that is transmembrane pressure tmp membrane permeability falls keeping membrane permeability at an acceptable level in terms of energy consumption for pumping requires curative cleaning techniques the two principal ones carried out industrially being backwashing and cleaning in place chang et al 2017 regula et al 2014 backwashing is the mechanical action whereby a reversed flow is pumped from the permeate to the intake side of a membrane whereas cleaning in place consists in a chemical solution being pumped in the membrane module without displacing it from its rack these techniques not only consume water and chemicals but also energy for pumping membrane performances i e permeability water recovery rate depend on the quality of input water to be filtered in particular the complexity of fouling as a phenomenon arises in part from the complex matrix of input water particulate and colloidal matter have been identified as major foulants that remain loosely attached on the membrane surface and can therefore be easily removed by hydraulic washing procedures howe and clark 2002 peiris et al 2010 more problematic foulants are those that are tightly bound to the membrane typically natural organic matter fractions and thus require chemical action for their removal mallevialle et al 1996 interactions between foulants add to the complexity of fouling particulate and organic matter interactions have for example been documented to form a combined fouling layer and calcium ions to cross link with negatively charged functional groups present in organic matter alresheedi et al 2019 peldszus et al 2011 jermann et al 2008 with the ever increasing awareness of environmental issues research efforts on drinking water production have transcended purely technical considerations and have begun to focus on the environmental footprint of production processes environmental assessment tools are necessary for this a notable example being life cycle assessment lca this internationally recognized and standardized tool consists of four interdependent phases iso 2006 firstly the lca goal and scope are defined then material and energy flows from and to the environment are listed and quantified in a life cycle inventory lci in a third phase inputs and outputs previously identified are transformed into potential environmental impacts with life cycle impact assessment lcia methodologies in the final interpretation phase the first three phases are reviewed and improvement strategies as well as recommendations are made membrane based systems for drinking water production from ground and surface waters have been dealt with in lca studies notably with uf as the central unit of a treatment process chain friedrich 2001 igos et al 2014 as a pretreatment for nanofiltration ribera et al 2014 or polishing stage of a clarification sand filtration ozonation process vince et al 2008 see table 1 the environmental assessments are carried out at a process level and relative contributions of unit operations are identified for example vince et al 2008 point out that the uf operation is the greatest electrical consumer of the drinking water production process remineralization coagulation flocculation settling sand filtration ozonation activated carbon filtration uf chlorination dedicated to treat surface water with high organic content and low hardness to the best of our knowledge no information is found on how to specifically operate at a unit operation level including uf for environmental impact mitigation these studies are predominantly carried out under fixed site specific operating conditions as shown in table 1 exceptions consider variable operating conditions with limited values for example friedrich 2001 examines three design parameters i e membrane filtration flux module length and number of modules per rack each of which can have two different values the considered production process prefiltration uf chlorination produces 200 000 m3 of potable water per day from surface water results show a greater sensitivity of environmental impacts to filtration flux and module arrangement than module length vince et al 2008 go beyond specific cases and have developed black box models for drinking water unit operations to calculate the lci and output water characteristics from three types of input parameters equipment design e g type of membrane local conditions e g energy supply plant location and feed water characteristics i e quality flow rate unfortunately no further detail is given on model equations or the specific influence of operating conditions interestingly mery et al 2013 combined lca with process modelling for the ecodesign of conventional drinking water plants the developed tool is based on models of unit operations that calculate environmental impacts from design facts equipment sizing and operating conditions unit operations include coagulation granular activated carbon filtration and ozonation but membrane filtration has not been examined to the best of our knowledge such methodological approach has never been undertaken for membrane filtration in the field of drinking water production from ground and surface water in particular for ultrafiltration it is thus legitimate to consider that operating conditions have an influence on environmental impacts and can thus be an action lever to reduce them not only can existing drinking water plants go through upgrades but plants that are yet to be designed can be involved in such an ecodesign approach a second point is that cause effect relationships between operating conditions and environmental impacts are far from straightforward and are to be further investigated notably by taking into account the specificity and complexity of the system under study at a unit operation level for membrane filtration it would for example entail examining fouling and remediation methods what is ultimately pointed out is the relevance of going beyond specific cases and developing flexible and modular decision making tools that consider the unit operation level with the associated operating conditions the generic process modelling lca approach used in this study follows this objective given the complexity of fouling and its remediation this approach is applied to membrane filtration only in this work a previous study has considered membrane fabrication prézélus et al 2020 and membrane end of life is out of the scope the aims of this study are 1 to develop an original model and simulation tool of dead end uf as a unit operation for drinking water production 2 to evaluate the contribution of inputs and outputs on environmental impacts and 3 to assess the influence of operating conditions leading to possible improvements in the first part of our study the model development for dead end inside out hollow fiber filtration is explained and lca information is detailed in the second part a case study of the operation of cellulose triacetate cta uf membranes is examined 2 material and methods first of all the process and global framework of the model are explained along with the underlying model hypotheses all model equations are specifically given in appendix a focus is then given on lca information 2 1 process description the drinking water production process considered in this study concerns only the uf unit operation which consists in the succession of operating cycles i e alternation of filtration and backwash bw cycles concluded by a clean in place cip cycle the process can be described according to its three lines see fig 1 the uf line consists in input water transferred by the intake pump through the prefilter and uf modules into the permeate tank for storage input water either refers to ground and surface waters or water having undergone a previous pre treatment the uf modules are made up of inside out hollow fiber membranes operating in a dead end configuration in the bw line water is transferred by the bw pump from the permeate tank to the uf modules and prefilter with a reversed flow outside in a bw chemical is injected at the permeate tank outlet to avoid microbial proliferation in the uf modules the bw waste is decanted clear liquid is sent back to the prefilter and the sludge is sent to a wastewater treatment plant wwtp in the cip line several chemical solutions are first successively prepared in a cip tank with water from the permeate tank and injected cip chemicals these solutions are successively fed into the uf modules in the same direction as for filtration inside out liquid waste containing cip chemicals is sent to a wwtp whereas rinsing water from the final cip phase is discharged to a surface waterbody coelho et al 2019 environmental impacts in this study are calculated as a function of 1 m3 of ultrafiltered produced water which corresponds to a net volume after deduction of permeate water used up during backwashing and cleaning in place 2 2 model framework the model is valid for a hollow fiber membrane unit in a dead end configuration with a defined daily output water flow rate the model considers non stop membrane operation once the initial start up phase of the membrane unit is over membrane manufacturers indeed observe that permeability falls from an initial value e g ultra pure water permeability to a lower value noted lp1 1 1 in what follows due to the shift from ultra pure to more fouling real water inge 2014 the model calculates consumptions and waste and provides engineering design data relative permeability module operating life etc from both intrinsic and user defined input parameters see zoom on uf model in fig 2 as a first step these parameters are considered as constant over the module operating life intrinsic parameters are defined as imposed upon drinking water operators and plant designers such as the membrane fouling rate or thresholds defined by previous conducted research in particular the membrane fouling rate stems from choices made on membrane material operating conditions and input water quality operators and designers have no action on these input parameters unlike user defined parameters that can be changed and adapted on site or during design examples of user defined parameters include operating conditions and engineering design data e g number of modules their arrangement in blocks head loss input water quality can also be altered by adjusting the operation of upstream unit operations according to variable ground or surface water quality input parameters have been divided in this way to distinguish parameters that can be acted upon and serve as levers of action for operational and design strategies from parameters that cannot a detailed list of parameters is given in table 2 and the exhaustive list can be found in tables a 1 and a 2 in appendix a 2 2 1 intrinsic parameters 2 2 1 1 input water category and threshold operating conditions consideration of input water quality in the model is based on industrial practices due to the complexity of fouling and the difficulty to model it water suppliers have adopted a pragmatic approach of categorization so as to give guidance on how to conduct uf as a function of input water quality input water can be categorized according to two global easy to measure analytical parameters that have shown to be discriminating as regards fouling turbidity and total organic carbon toc coelho et al 2019 for example category 0 corresponds to high quality input water with low levels of turbidity and toc whereas category 3 corresponds to low quality input water with high turbidity and toc values each input water category is associated with recommended threshold operating conditions i e filtration flux bw and cip frequency specific to each water supplier and derived from industrial case studies in accordance with these industrial practices the definition of input water categories is inserted as intrinsic parameters of the model other intrinsic parameters are the three associated thresholds maximum filtration flux minimum bw and cip frequencies user defined parameters and model calculations must never exceed these thresholds 2 2 1 2 intrinsic parameters fouling rate and remediation efficiencies the model and in particular relative permeability variations hinges on three key intrinsic parameters fouling rate during filtration cycles bw efficiency and cip efficiency in this work the fouling rate during filtration vf is defined as the decline rate of relative permeability lp l p 1 1 1 f per unit of permeate volume v per membrane surface area s and expressed in m 1 1 v f d lp l p 1 1 1 f d v s by way of reminder lp1 1 1 is the permeability once the initial start up phase of the membrane unit is over an interesting feature of fouling rate described as in equation 1 is to eliminate dependency on filtration flux thereby lowering the number of degrees of freedom indeed for a given membrane material there is one fouling rate value per input water quality when both filtration flux and input water quality are held constant the fouling rate per unit of permeate volume can be readily converted to a fouling rate per unit of time as illustrated in fig 3 a bw efficiency bw is defined as the ratio of relative permeability recovery during a bw cycle δ lp l p 1 1 1 bw to relative permeability decline between the start and end of the preceding filtration cycle δ lp l p 1 1 1 f cip efficiency cip is defined as the ratio of relative permeability recovery during a cip cycle δ lp l p 1 1 1 cip to relative permeability decline between the start of the ongoing operating cycle and the start of the cip cycle δ lp l p 1 1 1 op see fig 3 b in a first approach all three intrinsic parameters are assumed to be constant studies have highlighted the variability over time of membrane properties and process behaviour including cip efficiency porcelli and judd 2010 cip efficiency can increase over time due to more permeable membranes as a result of their chemical degradation during cip amplified by mechanical stress of bws pellegrin et al 2013 it has also been hypothesized that the chemical ageing of membranes account for a greater sensitivity to fouling compared to virgin membranes touffet et al 2015 such opposite effects of membrane ageing on permeability make it difficult to quantitatively predict the evolution of parameters such as fouling rate bw or cip efficiencies integrating such effects in the model would require a complete dataset of tmp over time of the uf unit by default bw and cip efficiencies have been initialized with parameters having true constant values membrane operating life initial and final permeabilities industrial values can readily be found in the literature bersillon et al 1989 clark et heneghan 1991 coelho et al 2019 mallevialle et al 1996 the fouling rate can then be inferred from the bw and cip efficiencies another possible approach beyond the scope of this study would be to implement a statistical analysis to process large sets of industrial or laboratory data teychene et al 2018 which could result in regression functions suggested for the three intrinsic parameters as a function of input water quality e g turbidity toc membrane characteristics and operating conditions e g bw and cip conditions a prerequisite for this semi empirical approach is access to a large set of industrial values over a long period of time e g a year results from such an analysis as well as those from specific research studies on membrane ageing for example can be later integrated in the developed model 2 2 1 3 intrinsic parameters end of life thresholds the end of life of any given membrane module is reached when at least one of four conditions has been met maximum operating life minimum productivity maximum chemical resistance and maximum mechanical resistance the last three conditions imply membrane ageing note should be taken that it can be difficult to distinguish between chemical and physical ageing of membranes since consequences on membrane performances e g permeability may be similar rouaix et al 2006 maximum operating life corresponds to a defined duration that has been reached this duration can for example correspond to the membrane manufacturer s warranty after which breakdowns are not insured anymore or to the membrane manufacturer s recommendation to systematically renew modules after a given period of time for precautionary measures in the case of minimum productivity a defined permeability is reached after a bw cycle below this minimum permeability the module is considered unproductive unless an unacceptably high tmp is applied in this study the maximum chemical resistance corresponds to a defined c x t value that has been reached for one of the chemicals used for backwashing or cleaning in place it expresses the chemical intensity in ppm day and corresponds to the chemical s concentration c multiplied by the contact time t with the membrane surface to maintain the chemical integrity of the membrane and the module as a whole a maximum tolerable number of cip cycles is determined for each chemical arkhangelsky et al 2008 levitsky et al 2012 mallevialle et al 1996 as for maximum mechanical resistance a defined number of bw cycles has been reached bws have an effect on the physical integrity of membranes a maximum number of bw cycles is thus defined to stop operating modules before fibers are too fragile to mechanical stress mallevialle et al 1996 2 2 2 user defined parameters as shown in fig 2 user defined parameters are inputs of the model the output flow rate is defined as the average daily output flow rate and accounts for permeate loss during backwashes bws and clean in places cips following industrial practices and as explained in section 2 2 1 turbidity and toc are considered in the model as user defined parameters for input water quality characterization both are average values during the membrane facility s operating life which provides the advantage in a first approach to smooth the effect of temporary variations of input water quality operating conditions include filtration flux bw conditions i e flux permeate volume per unit of membrane surface chemical concentration and injection time fraction and cip conditions i e chemical concentration filtration and soaking duration and filtration and rinsing fluxes module characteristics refer to the membrane filtration surface initial permeability and void volume to be filled during cips pumping system characteristics include pump efficiencies pipe dimensions and minor loss coefficients of the pumping system pipes common to all blocks prefilter and pipes within a rack 2 2 3 model calculations in order to calculate consumptions and waste the model is based on the determination of relative permeability variations during the modules operating life relative permeability compares permeability at any given time to lp1 1 1 the initial permeability the latter varies from one module to another and from one membrane material to another thus making it difficult to compare absolute permeability values of modules with one another relative permeability allows this comparison to be made membrane modules are considered to respond in an equivalent manner to given operating conditions permeability variations and operating lifespan are for example identical from one module to another in the same membrane unit in reality there may be modules of different ages due to module replacement for example if too many broken fibers are present brehant et al 2009 the behaviour of modules calculated by the model corresponds to an average behaviour in the uf unit similarly hydraulic distribution in the piping system is never perfectly equal and hydraulic conditions may vary from one module to another depending on their position in the membrane unit due to lower head losses modules closest to the intake pump are subject to input water at a higher tmp than the furthest modules however it can be considered that hydraulic variations between membrane units are similar and hydraulic conditions given by the model corresponds to average conditions in the membrane facility module consumption may be derived from the number of modules needed to satisfy the daily output water flow rate and the operating life chemical consumption during cips and head loss both depend on module arrangement in blocks the module arrangement in the model is based on industrial practices according to which the membrane system is composed of several identical blocks two racks of two rows each containing the same number of modules an example of a possible module arrangement is given in appendix b energy consumption linked to pumping in part depends on the membrane facility s configuration and inherent minor head losses linear head loss is neglected in pumping calculations because negligible compared to minor head loss as an order of magnitude linear head loss is at most a tenth of minor head loss for rack lengths smaller or equal to 14m which corresponds to 80 modules per rack module diameter and space between modules are equal to 30 and 5 cm respectively racks are backwashed successively whilst the others remain in the filtration mode a first rack is cleaned then a second etc whereas material consumption of the bw chemical injection is taken into account its pumping is neglected in energy consumption calculations because negligible compared to bw water pumping 0 01 racks are also cleaned in place successively a cip cycle is composed of maximum 5 phases of which up to 3 phases consist in inside outside filtration with a chemical solution followed by a soaking period chemical injection in the cip tank is neglected in energy consumption calculations because negligible compared to tank filling with permeate water 0 9 in a fourth phase permeate water used in a closed circuit is filtered inside outside the fifth phase is a final rinsing step during which the permeate goes directly to waste further precisions on fluid circulation and rack rotations for bw and cip executions can be found in appendix c modelling equations used for consumption and waste calculation as well as engineering design data can be found in appendix a 2 3 life cycle assessment lca 2 3 1 goal and scope the goal of lca is to evaluate 1 the contribution of consumptions and generated waste on environmental impacts 2 the influence of operating conditions and 3 lever actions for improving environmental performances for our case study the uf unit is considered to be located in france and intended for drinking water production the functional unit is 1 m3 of ultrafiltered water the system boundaries consider membrane operation only including prefiltering ultrafiltering backwashing and cleaning in place see fig 1 energy and chemical consumptions are considered for these four unit processes transport of chemicals and waste from and to the uf unit and treatment of bw and cip liquid waste are also considered the fabrication and end of life of membranes are out of the scope of this study the former has been dealt with in one of our previous studies prézélus et al 2020 and the latter will be included in our forthcoming study the construction and decommissioning of infrastructure and equipment are not included in the environmental assessment indeed the modelling of each life cycle phase first needs to be developed before being able to consider the entire life cycle of membranes with the corresponding infrastructure umberto nxt software and ecoinvent 3 4 database are used with the allocation at the point of substitution for background processes i e energy production transportation chemicals production waste treatment etc 2 3 2 life cycle inventory lci the flowchart for lca calculation is presented in fig 2 the foreground is the uf drinking water production process as described in section 2 1 with input data collected from the scientific literature in this work the input data and the resulting modelled inventory are valid for an uf unit composed of cta hollow fiber modules operating in a french drinking water production context ideally a parametric model is needed to express the fouling rate of a given membrane as a function of at least turbidity and toc environmental assessments require that this model be based on industrial data from drinking water plants as opposed to theoretical or research data a considerable effort would then be needed to process data with advanced numerical tools e g artificial intelligence it was not possible to collect sufficient data to adjust such a parametric model due to the difficulty in obtaining such data which is sometimes confidential and due to the fact that drinking water plants do not always collect them in particular as regards bw and cip efficiency in such circumstances the literature has been used to obtain information for specific ranges and for different time spans of a membrane s operating life the choice has been made to verify the model of membrane operation by first defining a baseline scenario based on real data and then verifying the obtained inventory against literature values the baseline scenario has been defined as the dead end filtration at 100 l h 1 m 2 of a high quality input water i e 1 ntu 1 mg toc l 1 with cta hollow fibers having an initial permeability of 230 l h 1 m2 bar 1 the entire dataset of the baseline scenario is given in table 2 for this scenario literature values indicate a maximum membrane operating life i e 15 years and a minimum final productivity i e 100 l h 1 m2 bar 1 laîné et al 2000 for this scenario high remediation efficiencies i e 95 for both bw and cip have been suggested in consistency with the high quality input water the two values for bw cip along with the literature values allow to evaluate the fouling rate vf the fouling rate i e 7 9 10 3 m 1 actually corresponds to a decline in permeability equal to 0 18 l h 1 m2 bar 1 per filtration cycle of 60 min at 100 l h 1 m2 it should be pointed out that such a low permeability decline in a drinking water plant can only be detected over a significant number of filtration cycles which makes its validation from real data impossible in this context it was deemed relevant to have an order of magnitude of the percentage of fouled surface and to put it in perspective with the fouling rate its low value is in line with the low values of deposited turbidity and toc during a filtration cycle as defined in the baseline scenario 100 ntu and 100 mg per m2 of membrane surface respectively the turbidity deposit can be assimilated to 330 mg of bentonite dry density 2 500 kg m 3 particle size 4 µm which means that only 5 of the membrane surface is covered by bentonite particles at the end of a filtration cycle this is coherent with the high quality input water concerning the bw line it is considered that 100 of the bw waste is sent back to the prefilter the volume taken up by the sludge after decantation is supposed to be zero in the baseline scenario the full list of parameter values and their literature references are found in table 2 for sake of clarity input water quality categories and associated thresholds are provided in appendix a table a 6 2 3 3 life cycle impact assessment lcia two recognized evaluation methods are used to calculate environmental impacts with the lca software umberto nxt 1 ipcc s gwp100a that specifically evaluates the topical subject of climate change at midpoint units in kg co2 eq and 2 recipe endpoint method that consists in 17 impact categories e g agricultural land occupation human toxicity fossil depletion etc grouped in 3 areas of protection i e ecosystem quality human health and resource depletion units in points scores of these 17 categories can be aggregated into a unique score the hierarchist cultural perspective is taken as recipe default model 2 3 4 interpretation a sensitivity analysis of environmental scores of the baseline scenario is carried out on the electricity mix the nuclear based electricity taken as reference is compared to french renewable electricity sources hydropower wind biomass and solar the precise ecoinvent unit processes used are to be found in appendix d the sensitivity of environmental scores to variations in several parameters for membrane operation is also studied through scenarios and trends that can be identified the scenario based approach is based on the same premise as the lca approach developed in this work process oriented thinking for a realistic and physical representation of the studied system as such four plausible scenarios are elaborated based on the baseline scenario as a reminder the fouling rate bw and cip efficiencies in the baseline scenario have been adjusted by setting the membrane operating life and initial and final permeabilities in the four scenarios the fouling rate and remediation efficiencies are hypothesized based on the defined operating conditions and initial and final permeabilities module operating life is not set anymore but calculated values defined for operating conditions and permeabilities are within the ranges found in the literature see table 2 hypotheses need to be made on fouling rate and remediation efficiencies since no specific industrial or laboratory data is available qualitative information is however available in the literature that indicates the direction of change of these three intrinsic parameters as a function of operating conditions a greater bw efficiency for a greater bw flux nakatskuka et al 1996 a greater fouling rate for a lower quality input water mallevialle et al 1996 a greater cip efficiency for a greater cip chemical concentration bird bartlett 2002 scenario a considers an operating strategy whereby bw flux is increased from 250 to 300 l h 1 m 2 given that an asymptotic like behavior has been observed for bw efficiency increase with bw pressure nakatsuka et al 1996 kennedy et al 1998 the hypothesis of bw efficiency increasing from 95 to 97 makes sense in scenario b filtration flux is increased from 100 to 130 l h 1 m 2 the choice is made to adapt the filtration cycle duration from 60 to 46 min so as to maintain constant the deposited mass during a filtration cycle since filtration flux is multiplied by 1 3 filtration cycle duration is divided by 1 3 the relative permeability decline during a filtration cycle thus also remains the same and so does bw efficiency scenario c considers a degraded input water quality 2 mg toc l 1 thereby not only contributing to fouling but also making hydraulic removal by backwashing difficult alresheedi et al 2019 peiris et al 2010 peldszus et al 2011 teychene et al 2018 these observations lead to suggest a lower fouling rate i e 8 1 10 3 m 1 and bw efficiency i e 93 in scenario d the same conditions as those for scenario c are taken with the exception of a greater cip chemical concentration 3 instead of 1 5 g l 1 studies clearly indicate an influence of cip chemical concentration on cip efficiency bird and bartlett 2002 nigam et al 2008 väisänen et al 2002 hence the hypothesis of cip efficiency increasing from 95 to 97 values that differ between the four aforementioned scenarios and the baseline scenario are summarized in table 3 3 results 3 1 lci analysis and model verification the modelled inventory and the ecoinvent unit processes used for each input and waste treatment are given in appendix e in what follows calculated values found in this table are compared to literature values for model verification in particular for electricity consumption and liquid waste see table 4 it can be seen that the modelled value kwh for electricity consumption is consistently lower than literature values this is expected for friedrich s 2001 value range since it includes electricity consumptions of sand filtration and chlorination on top of uf which is moreover carried out in a cross flow configuration as opposed to the less energy intensive dead end filtration in our study glucina 1998 amongst the listed references lipp et al s 1998 conditions are the most similar to ours in terms of filtration configuration membrane material and filtration operating conditions the tmp is 28 higher than the average tmp of the baseline scenario 0 6 bar which in part explains that electricity values are 3 to 4 times greater than the modelled value kwh the remaining difference may come from the real life context of lipp et al s 1998 study most importantly as regards fluctuating input water quality real surface water was either sand filtered or microstrained before being used as input to the pilot scale ultrafiltration plant leading to varying fouling rate and permeability decline in contrast a constant input water quality is considered in the baseline scenario of our study more generally our study considers constant filtration flux and a lack of shutdowns the former model simplification removes pressure variations due to hydraulic shocks whilst the latter implies no extra electricity for pump restart as a result electricity consumptions are underestimated as opposed to real life measurements on pilot or industrial scale drinking water treatment plants such as those in chew et al s 2015 2016 and glucina et al s 1998 studies as regards igos et al s 2014 and liu and mauter s 2020 work absent details of operating conditions hinders complete analysis relatively low discrepancies are obtained for water recovery which is defined as the percentage of input water that leaves the uf unit as ultrafiltered water see table 4 the modelled value 95 2 is similar to those found by lipp et al 1998 and friedrich 2001 given this correct order of magnitude and that concentrations of chemicals i e sodium hypochlorite citric acid ammonia and sodium hydroxide are based on literature values see table 2 it can be inferred that modelled values for chemical consumption are also in the correct order of magnitude 3 2 impacts of the baseline scenario in the baseline scenario the operation of hollow fiber membranes for the production of 1 m3 of ultrafiltered water generates impacts amounting to 4 1 10 3 kg co2 eq and 4 5 10 4 points for ipcc gwp100a and recipe endpoint scores respectively process inputs and waste are grouped in clusters for the study of their respective contributions see appendix e the cluster cip chemicals for example aggregates citric acid ammonia and sodium hydroxide more than 99 of both ipcc gwp100a and recipe scores are attributable to the bw chemical and electricity production indeed bw chemical production contributes to 57 and 54 of ipcc gwp100a and recipe scores respectively electricity production contributes to 43 and 45 of respective scores see appendix f for further results in particular intake pumping accounts for the major part 90 of electricity consumption whereas bw pumping accounts for the remaining 10 the contribution of cip pumping to energy consumption is negligible these relative contributions are in line with the average tmp and cumulative duration of each operating mode filtration bw and cip it can further be noted that annual cleaning in place has very insignificant impacts 2 not only is pumping during cip phases negligible 0 01 compared to total electricity consumption but negligible impacts are also observed for cip chemicals and waste treatment the detailed recipe results are presented in fig 4 for all impact categories and by cluster three endpoint impact categories account together for around 70 of total endpoint impacts fossil depletion climate change for human health and climate change for ecosystem quality it is to be noted that climate change results with the recipe endpoint method correspond to damages expressed in points due to temperature elevation whereas ipcc gwp100a results consider radiative forcing to express climate change at midpoint in kg co2 eq for each impact category distributions between the clusters bw chemical and electricity are between 55 and 57 for the former and between 42 and 44 for the latter these distributions for specific recipe impact categories are similar to those for total recipe endpoint scores the dominant impacts of fossil depletion climate change particulate matter formation and ionizing radiation are correlated with each other since they correspond to impacts of energy production and consumption i e electricity used in the foreground process and energy used for chemical production the important contribution of electricity consumption in environmental results leads to ponder on the influence of the electricity source in this work the assumed ecoinvent unit process relates to a french electricity mix composed of 71 nuclear 10 hydropower 6 natural gas 4 wind 2 coal and 7 other including oil biomass biogas given the ongoing sustainable developments of the sector french renewable electricity sources are considered for a sensitivity analysis hydropower wind biomass and solar total life cycle ipcc gwp100a results are 40 36 20 and 10 respectively lower compared to that of the baseline scenario with french electricity mix total life cycle recipe endpoint results are 42 35 8 lower for system with hydropower wind and solar respectively compared to the system using french electricity mix total life cycle impacts are however 1050 greater for system with biomass cogeneration due to predominant impacts on urban land occupation this sensitivity analysis clearly points out the influence of the electricity mix on environmental impacts 3 3 influence of operating conditions as a reminder four scenarios are considered to study the sensitivity of environmental scores to variations of operating conditions see table 3 for parameter values for these four scenarios values of calculated parameters are coherent with changes in input parameters see appendix g for extensive values for scenario a the module operating life increases by 36 compared to the baseline scenario from 15 0 to 23 5 years due to increased bw efficiency by 2 the end of life condition is not the minimum permeability 100 l h 1 m 2 bar 1 anymore but the maximum number of bw cycles which has been reached and set at 200 000 this is the top value in the suggested range see table 2 without the end of life condition on mechanical resistance the module operating life would have been 37 9 years which is unrealistic in scenario a the final permeability equals 151 l h 1 m 2 bar 1 the filtration average permeability is thus greater than in the baseline scenario which in part explains the lower filtration average tmp 0 54 instead of 0 60 bar the second reason is the greater bw efficiency 97 instead of 95 meaning that there is more permeability recovery at the end of a bw cycle it follows that energy consumption falls sodium hypochlorite consumption remains constant however since injection conditions duration volume frequency of the bw chemical are the same in scenario a the change in bw flux impacts on the bw efficiency only not on the injected volume of sodium hypochlorite since the volume used during each bw cycle is unchanged cip chemical consumption varies by 4 5 since a cip occurs every 1 02 year 23 cips in 23 5 years compared to every 1 07 years for the baseline scenario 14 cips in 15 0 years for scenario b the number of modules is 192 compared to 252 in the baseline scenario and the average tmp during filtration rises from 0 60 to 0 79 bar these variations are proportional to the increased filtration flux the operating cycle duration i e cip frequency is also impacted and falls from 365 to 296 days whereas cips in the baseline scenario start when the maximum operating cycle duration is reached cips in scenario b start when the maximum relative permeability decline during an operating cycle is reached it has been defined as equal to 0 35 in all scenarios which is equivalent to a permeability of 150 l h 1 m 2 for the first operating cycle this threshold permeability is reached sooner in scenario b because the relative permeability decline of 7 9 10 4 during a filtration cycle occurs after 46 min only as compared to 60 min in the baseline scenario like for scenario a no change in sodium hypochlorite consumption is observed injection conditions are the same indeed sodium hypochlorite is still injected every 100 l m 2 even if backwashing occurs every 46 min instead of 60 min despite more frequent cips the consumption of cip chemicals decreases by 11 due to a lower number of blocks 4 instead of 7 and modules per row 12 instead of 9 on a per module basis the volume needed to fill pipes is reduced to 1 04 m3 in scenario c the operating life falls from 15 0 to 10 2 years due to decreased bw efficiency and fouling rate these unfavourable conditions first lead to shorter operating cycles 265 instead of 365 days like for scenario b the maximum relative permeability decline during an operating cycle is reached before the maximum operating cycle duration the greater cip frequency leads to a 37 increase in cip chemical consumption then the end of life condition of minimum permeability 100 l h 1 m 2 bar 1 is reached given that the initial and final permeabilities are the same as for the baseline scenario the filtration average tmp does not significantly change 0 60 bar in scenario d the increased cip efficiency offsets the decreased bw efficiency indeed the operating life i e 16 0 years is greater than in the baseline scenario and scenario c operating cycles still last 265 like in scenario c since values for the fouling rate and bw efficiency are identical cips start due to the maximum relative permeability decline during an operating cycle being reached as expected cip chemical consumption increases proportionally with respect to the cip chemical concentration from 1 5 to 3 0 g l 1 the question that arises now is whether these variations are significant from an environmental point of view environmental scores and contributions of cluster process inputs and waste for membrane operation only are very similar between scenarios a c and d and the baseline scenario percentage changes are 2 at the most see table 5 and fig 5 this is not surprising since average tmp during filtration bw frequency and duration are similar or identical it is furthermore known from model calculations that intake pumping contributes to more than 90 to electricity consumption and that the two clusters electricity and bw chemical are the greatest contributors to environmental scores not only are electricity and bw chemical consumptions similar between these scenarios water recovery rates are too i e 95 as shown in table 5 specific electricity and bw chemical consumptions are thus also similar maximum 5 7 of absolute difference unlike in scenario b it can be concluded that environmental scores are insensitive to the studied variations of vf bw cip in scenarios a c and d that is for a cut off of 2 in absolute values this should however not be generalized since other operating conditions could lead to these same variations of vf bw cip but to different environmental scores for example differences in final permeability and consequently in average tmp during filtration may be observed when the limiting end of life condition is different this is the case for scenario a for which the module operating life is determined by the maximum number of bw cycles moderate changes in environmental impacts are observed 2 in absolute values which could moreover be more significant if a threshold lower than 200 000 bw cycles were to be defined the filtration cycle duration in all three scenarios is also the same as in the baseline scenario changing this filtration cycle duration would impact on bw efficiency as well as on specific consumptions the influence of vf bw cip on environmental impacts should then be reassessed under these other operating conditions in short a first prerequisite is to determine precisely the end of life thresholds e g minimum permeability maximum number of bw cycles a second prerequisite is to determine the influence of filtration cycle duration on bw efficiency in scenario b a high sensitivity of environmental scores to changes in filtration flux and filtration cycle duration is observed depending on the considered evaluation method scores are 29 or 31 greater in scenario b compared to the baseline scenario see table 5 contributions of electricity production rise at the expense of bw chemical fabrication from 42 45 in the baseline scenario to 56 59 in scenario b it can be concluded that the influence of the increased filtration flux in scenario b is greater than that of the increased bw frequency regardless of the evaluation method or recipe endpoint impact category 3 4 analysis of global trends the study confirms that electricity and bw chemical production are two major points of interest for mitigating environmental impacts of the ultrafiltration stage with cta inside out hollow fibers mitigating impacts from bw chemical consumption can first of all consist in adjusting bw operating conditions i e injection time concentration to avoid overconsumption due to precautionary measures variations in environmental scores are sensitive to these adjustments for example halving the bw chemical concentration from 5 to 2 5 ppm in the baseline scenario decreases gwp100 and recipe endpoint scores by 29 and 27 respectively microbial proliferation prevention strategies can also be considered such as using better suited materials to biofouling for membrane and module components chemical compounds with a lower environmental footprint than sodium hypochlorite can also be investigated mitigation strategies related to electricity consumption can consist in fabricating more permeable and or low fouling membranes the initial permeability and fouling rate would respectively be higher and lower thereby providing a higher average permeability given that intake pumping accounts for the majority of electricity consumption in all considered scenarios i e a minimum of 88 for scenario b it is also particularly impactful to focus on filtration sequences when it comes to adjusting operating conditions in this respect the comparison between the baseline scenario and scenario b shows filtration flux as a relevant operating condition to act on the percentage variation in environmental scores is inversely proportional to the percentage variation in filtration flux the sensitivity analysis on the electricity mix also shows that using renewable energy sources especially hydropower and wind energy can mitigate environmental impacts to the same extent as lowering filtration flux by extension these two measures combined have the potential to halve these impacts provided necessary structural adaptations are made hydropower requires falling or fast running water near the drinking water plant as well as appropriate infrastructure wind energy requires favorable local conditions and its fluctuating nature implies using storage and or at least one controllable source of energy as for lower filtration fluxes the greater number of modules to be installed implies capital expenditure and extra floor area in the drinking water plant itself such changes if technically feasible call for long term planning whereas acting on bw chemical consumption can be based on simple trial and error tests followed by a swift implementation which seems adapted as a first line optimization strategy given limited resources as regards the developed model this study has showed that operating conditions have an influence on both process parameters and environmental impacts in particular the high sensitivity of module operating life and the number of filtration cycles to operating conditions see appendix g calls for a detailed knowledge of the three key intrinsic parameters fouling rate bw and cip efficiencies finding relevant and complete datasets of these parameters in the literature is compromised by the long time scale several years and the confidentiality of industrial values ideally tmp values over time for different qualities of input water could serve as a basis for a statistical analysis and modelling of these three parameters as a function of input water quality membrane material and operating conditions access and analysis of such data would represent an improvement over the pragmatic approach of associating threshold operating conditions to input water quality categories based on turbidity and toc the dependency of the number of modules and their operating life to operating conditions reveals that module consumption varies from one scenario to another the associated environmental impacts are related to the fabrication stage of the modules life cycle a previous study specifically considered a generic process modelling and lca approach for uf membrane fabrication prézélus et al 2020 although this stage is beyond the scope of this study taking it into account opens up prospects on the eco design of membrane modules on a life cycle scale new questions that arise are the relative impacts of fabrication operation and end of life and the key operating conditions of each stage for environmental mitigation the underlying objective is not only to ecodesign membrane filtration as a unit operation but to ecodesign sequences of unit operations making up an entire production process ultimately membrane based production processes can be compared from an environmental point of view to conventional ones and serve as criteria in the decision making of design for drinking water production from ground or surface water 4 conclusion the methodological novelty of this study whereby process modelling is coupled with lca is of importance for the scientific community since the influence of operating conditions on environmental impacts can be fully investigated and serve as a basis for impact mitigation the generic model that has been developed following this approach addresses the complexity and specificity of membrane operation especially regarding fouling and remediation methods variations of relative permeability are calculated from key model parameters i e fouling rate bw and cip efficiencies the model could moreover be improved by correlating these three parameters to relevant operating conditions such as input water quality bw and cip conditions a statistical analysis of a large dataset would be an appropriate tool the initial results obtained with the generic process modelling lca model put forth the predominant contributions of electricity production and bw chemical fabrication to gwp100a and recipe endpoint scores mitigation strategies include further reducing total dynamic head of the system and fine tuning bw operating conditions lca results also confirm that environmental impacts may be sensitive to changes in operating conditions notably when considering filtration flux and filtration cycle duration this demonstrates the relevance of such a parameterized model of the membrane operation stage as compared to conducting a lca with fixed operating conditions the flexibility and modularity of the developed generic model allow its use beyond the presented case study membrane materials other than cta can for example be examined by adapting values of material specific parameters such as initial permeability fouling rate and cip conditions the same holds for other applications such as direct filtration of low input water quality e g higher toc and turbidity with an online addition of a coagulant it would involve among other things new values for input water quality and thresholds associated with input water categories as well as the integration of the coagulant in the life cycle inventory the model could also be adapted to a cross flow configuration recirculation would need to be taken into account with an additional pump a modified piping system and included in input water quality calculations lastly other types of filtration e g microfiltration nanofiltration can be considered as regards the integration of environmental evaluation in membrane science and technology our model development for membrane operation is only but a first step since the same approach must be carried out on the other life cycle s stages namely membrane fabrication and end of life in this way it will be possible to fully ecodesign membranes by determining key mitigation parameters and strategies and compare membrane based

16971,fecal contamination of water and its associated pathogens are a major public health concern in both developing and industrialized areas fecal indicator bacteria fib are commonly used to assess microbial water quality but they require a relatively long period of incubation time currently molecular techniques have been applied to rapidly detect fib however these molecular techniques require expensive and sophisticated equipment in this study we developed a rapid on chip gene quantification method based on loop mediated isothermal amplification lamp pcr the lamp assays can measure the target genes of the fecal indicator bacteria fib including e coli and enterococcus spp using the most probable number mpn approach the colorimetric lamp assay allows for naked eye observation of the pcr reaction as few as 4 gene copies well when the reaction ends mpn measurement of positive outcomes on the white based pmma polymethacrylic acid microchips provides the concentrations of the target genes of fib with a confidence interval we validated the feasibility of the mpn lamp approach by obtaining a strong correlation between the results of the mpn estimations and the qpcr analysis moreover the mpn lamp approach was used to quantify the fib in different environmental water collected from the freshwater reservoirs beach agriculture farm and sewage our research demonstrates that the mpn lamp method enables us to easily and quickly quantifying fib genes isolated from the environment without expensive qpcr instruments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords loop mediated isothermal amplification most probable number pmma microchip fecal indicator bacteria 1 introduction fecal contamination is a serious threat to public health in both developing and industrialized countries diverse groups of enteric pathogens transmitted through human and animal feces can cause outbreaks of waterborne disease the threat to human and environmental health posed by fecal contamination is usually evaluated by measuring the concentrations of fecal indicator bacteria fib fib such as fecal coliforms escherichia coli and enterococcus are monitored by culture dependent methods that require a microbiological laboratory and overnight incubation bae and wuertz 2009 however culture based fib methods are limited in detecting the viable but non culturable vbnc state so the water sampled could retain its pathogenicity lee and bae 2017 another constraint associated with culture based fib methods delay in providing results due to the overnight incubation requirement which hinders early warnings and the timely implementation of measures for controlling or mitigating contamination noble and weisberg 2005 thus there has been a growing demand for rapid detection techniques that can determine the microbiological quality of water used for drinking bathing or irrigation li et al 2020 to address the limitations of the culture dependent methods dna based approaches like the polymerase chain reaction pcr have been used to rapidly assess microbial contamination in an environment converse et al 2012 for example a quantitative pcr qpcr method was implemented by the us environmental protection agency usepa to molecularly detect enterococci this method is now used to perform routine water quality monitoring in recreational water u s epa 2015 however pcr based approaches for fib monitoring highly rely on access to a large modern laboratory skilled personnel and expensive equipment resulting in preventing the in field and rapid assessment of water quality recently a technique called the loop mediated isothermal amplification lamp assay has been introduced to rapidly detect target genes martzy et al 2017 lamp is highly sensitive because it is tolerant of common pcr inhibitors from water lee et al 2019 notomi et al 2000 lamp reactions can be conducted under isothermal conditions ranging from 60 c to 65 c using a regular laboratory bath or a heat block instead of needing costly equipment such as a thermal cycler ghosh et al 2015 moreover unlike a conventional pcr if a dna intercalating dye is added to the lamp reagent e g sybr green i ethidium bromide hydroxyl naphthol blue hnb the endpoint color changes caused by lamp amplification can easily be confirmed with the naked eye iwamoto et al 2003 nagamine et al 2002 tomlinson et al 2010 thus lamp has been used as an alternative point of care testing tool for a wide variety of applications including pcr lin et al 2012 despite being easy for researchers to use and the benefits of the method using low cost equipment in resource limited settings lee et al 2019 a lamp assay s main limitation in microbial water quality assessment is quantifying target microorganisms the most probable number mpn pcr method has been used as an alternative to quantitative pcr qpcr when determining the concentration of fib in water ishii et al 2006 schulz et al 2010 wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 zhao et al 2014 while qpcr has advantages including higher precision and no post pcr processing mpn pcr on the other hand is a simple and sensitive method that doesn t require special software and costly instruments sharma et al 2007 mpn pcr has been used for the quantitative detection of microorganisms in the soil water and food samples henry et al 2015 inoue and nakaho 2014 robert pillot et al 2010 savill et al 2001 the aim of this study therefore was to implement microchip based lamp pcr to quantify fib in water in this study a polymethyl methacrylate pmma based microchip was designed because it is low cost easy to fabricate and saves pcr reagents sun et al 2007 the objectives of this study were i to validate the mpn lamp on the pmma microchip ii to evaluate the mpn lamp approach of quantifying target genes of fib by comparing it with qpcr results and iii to use the microchip based mpn lamp assays to monitor fecal contamination in environmental samples 2 materials and methods 2 1 design and fabrication of a microchip the microchips were fabricated using polymethyl methacrylate pmma sheets the microchip consisted of three layers a spacer layer a wells

the pcr reactions were performed on a veriti 96 well fast thermal cycler applied biosystem ca usa and the thermal cycling conditions were carried out under the following program initial denaturation at 95 c for 3 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 c for 30 s 60 c for 30 s and 72 c for 1 min and finally an extension step of 72 c for 10 min for standard curve preparation the pcr products were purified using the agencourt ampure pcr purification system agencourt bioscience corporation before the pcr products were inserted into a linearized plasmid vector pcr 2 1 subsequently plasmids were cloned into chemically competent e coli by using the ta cloningtm kit invitrogen thermo fisher scientific the plasmids containing the pcr amplicons were extracted from recombinant e coli using the genejet plasmid miniprep kit thermo fisher scientific us the concentrations of purified plasmids were further measured by the qubit double stranded dna dsdna high sensitivity hs assay kit the standard curves were generated using a serial 10 fold dilution of the pcr 2 1 plasmids vector containing the target genes the uida and 23 s rrna 2 4 measurement of fib in environmental water environmental water samples n 1 per location were collected from a beach an agricultural farm a freshwater reservoir and from two sewer manholes in singapore and immediately transported to the laboratory e coli and enterococcus were enumerated using the culture based methods colilert 18 and enterolert according to the manufacturer s recommendations idexx laboratories inc usa briefly one packet of reagent powder from a colilert or enterolert kit was dissolved in a 100 ml water sample in a sterile non fluorescing vessel the mixture was poured into a multi well tray quanti tray 2000 and sealed with an idexx quanti tray sealer the sealed tray was incubated at 37 c for colilerttm or 41 c for enterolerttm for 24 h respectively results were reported as the most probable number mpn per 100 ml of water according to the manufacturer s tables 2 5 genomic dna preparation from environmental sample genomic dna was extracted from environmental samples so the lamp mpn and qpcr assays could quantify the concentration of fib in water 30 l water samples from the beach agriculture farm and freshwater reservoir and a 5 l water sample from the sewer were used for the downstream processing of concentration determination after pre treatment of a blocking buffer filter sterilized 5 calf serum to a standard high flux f series dialyzer fresenius polysulfone hf80s fresenius medical care the environmental water samples were loaded into the dialyzer to concentrate water samples using a vacuum pump gardner denver wuxi china then 200 ml of elution buffer 4 m urea 50 mm lysine ph 9 0 was applied to elute the substances out subsequently a 10 ml eluted solution was filtered using a cn cellulose nitrate membrane filter of 0 22 µm pore size filterbio nantong china to separate the microbes on the membrane

table s1 the lamp assay on the microchip s procedure is illustrated in fig 1 in detail either the plasmid dna or genomic dna extracted from the environmental samples were first prepared in a series of 5 fold serial dilutions the 5 fold dilution was repeated 4 times in a row to achieve five levels of diluted subsamples including one with an initial concentration and four with diluted concentrations

2 μl dna subsamples and nuclease free water then 1 μl from the 5 μl reaction mixture was distributed into each well five replicates were prepared for each dilution level for the five tube mpn analysis the negative control was placed in parallel for each microchip after injecting reaction mixture into wells the mineral oil was covered over the reaction wells to prevent evaporation during the pcr reaction the lamp pcr reactions were carried out using a proflex 2 x flat pcr system applied biosystem ca usa for 35 min at 65 c and 61 c for uida e coli and 23 s rrna enterococcus spp respectively in the present study 35 min of lamp pcr reactions were applied as the additional heating did not provide an additional positive reaction the phenol red worked as a visible ph indicator in the lamp reaction the decreasing ph due to the accumulation of proton in the positive lamp reaction would turn the phenol red into yellow thus the results were confirmed positive when the color in a well

c 30 s at 60 c and 60 s at 72 c a melting curve analysis was conducted to confirm the specificity of the amplified product 2 8 data analysis mpn calculation in this study mpn was quantified based on a statistical approach using the formula shown below to calculate the gene copy number μ i 1 k d i p i v i 1 exp d i μ v i i 1 k d i n i v i the standard deviation sd of estimated μ was calculated by the following formula hurley and roscoe 1983 jarvis et al 2010 sd v a r μ i 1 k p i d i v i 2 exp d i μ v i 1 exp d i μ v i 2 1 2 in these equations k is the levels of dilution d i is the dilution factor p i is the number of positive subsamples n i is the total number of subsamples and v i is the volume of each reaction according to the experiment design in this study the volume of each reaction v i is 1 μl in each well and the total number of subsamples n i are 5 due to the 5 fold serial dilution and the dilution caused by master mix and primer mix reagents in the reaction the dilution factors d i for the 5 levels of subsamples are 0 04 0 008 0 0016 0 00032 and 0 000064 respectively we assume that the target genes are randomly distributed in the subsamples the numbers of target genes in wells are independent and the wells containing at least one target gene are positive after the reaction in this study the experiment design includes 5 dilution levels while only 3 digits are adopted when calculating the mpn based on the following rules i if the wells in several successive dilution levels are all positive the calculation starts with the most diluted level ii remove the dilution level if it and the next lower dilution level have all negative wells as long as this condition has least four dilution levels remaining iii continue to remove these dilution levels until only three dilution levels remain ahmad et al 2017 based on the principles of mpn demonstrated above we developed an mpn calculator an excel file of mpn estimation using the parameters in the present study mpn calculator xlsx supplementary information the adopted dilution levels for mpn calculation were decided based on the rules outlined above followed by inputting the number of positive subsamples and corresponding dilution factors the mpn calculator can provide us with the mpn and the 95 confidence limits 3 result 3 1 evaluation of mpn lamp on a pmma microchip in this study fib was enumerated using the mpn lamp method on a pmma microchip to develop a simple and field deployable approach to assess microbial contamination in water the genes uida of e coli and 23 s rrna of enterococcus were used to detect fib on the pmma microchip with corresponding lamp assays to achieve the isothermal pcr for e coli and enterococcus the optimal temperatures for isothermal pcr amplifications were 65 c and 61 c for target genes of uida and 23 s rrna the pcr amplification was confirmed within 35 mins with the pmma microchip in fig 2 the color changes in the lamp assays indicate successful lamp amplification suggesting that the pmma did not inhibit the lamp pcr reactions five replicates of positive and negative pcr reactions were conducted at different concentrations of plasmid dna as shown in fig 2 for both target genes of uida and 23 s rrna all positives turned yellow at concentrations equal to or higher than 104 copies μl and the nominal concentrations in the wells were no less than 400 copies well in these same reactions all the negative controls remained pink moreover the limit of detection lod was less than 102 copies resulting in 102 copies μl plasmid dna considering the dilution factor the nominal concentration was 4 copies well indicating a good sensitivity of the lamp assays on the microchip due to the sensitivity of the lamp assays a minor deviation in mpn calculation may occur when the concentration of the target is closed to lod furthermore correlations between the number of the positive and the diluted plasmid dna were on the microchip demonstrating that the diluted dna was distributed randomly within the microchip and target gene were independently present in each well 3 2 correlation of mpn lamp calculation and qpcr quantification the results from the mpn lamp pcr were compared to the results from the qpcr to estimate the most probable number of target genes in plasmid dna samples given the positive results in the dilution series fig 3 illustrates the number of positive results from the mpn lamp pcrs on microchips where each pmma chip contains different concentrations of the plasmid dna of enterococcus 23 s rrna and e coli uida respectively the wells with negative reactions shown in pink appeared at the highest dilution levels when concentrations were at 106 copies µl indicating that the concentration of the plasmid dna 106 copies µl did not exceed the upper bound on the concentration thus the quantification range of the target gene concentrations was from 102 to 106 copies μl the mpn lamp pcr was calculated based on the numbers of positive and negative reactions at different dilution levels the positive counts and the dilution level for each concentration were used to calculate mpn results with confidence limits in fig 3 the mpn results with lower and upper 95 confidence limits showed a corresponding relationship with the plasmid concentrations thus the correlation between the plasmid concentration and the calculated mpn results was determined using a fitting curve analysis fig 4 demonstrates a linear relationship between the plasmid concentration and the mpn estimation with the slope equal to 1 21 and 1 33 for 23 s rrna and uida respectively r2 0 99 the strong correlation between the concentrations of plasmid dna and calculated mpn indicated the high feasibility of using the mpn lamp approach on a pmma microchip to estimate the concentration of fib in water 3 3 mpn lamp on environmental samples genomic dna of environmental water samples from four different surface water including raw sewage beach agricultural runoff and reservoir water was used to validate the mpn lamp approach the mpn lamp assays on microchips were performed to enumerate 23 s rrna and uida genes as a proxy for fecal contaminations in environmental waters the mpn images as outcomes of lamp reactions in each well were analyzed to count positive reactions in serial dilutions fig 5 a the positive reaction counts over the number of total wells at each dilution level are listed in fig 5b mpns with a 95 confidence limit of target genes were calculated based on the positive reaction counts at dilution levels as shown in fig 5b the mpn images of both 23 s rrna and uida assay in genomic dna of raw sewage showed all positive reactions in the first dilution levels for the dna sample of beach water the concentration of enterococcus was higher than that of e coli as enterococcus is more persistent in marine water the mpn analysis for e coli uida in the genomic dna of the reservoir sample displayed all negative reactions while the concentration of enterococcus 23 s rrna was 1 02 102 gene copies µl thus the mpn lamp using the microchip can be applied to rapidly estimate fecal contamination under different environment matrixes furthermore the qpcr assays for e coli uida and enterococcus 23 s rrna genes were performed in parallel with the mpn lamp to compare the concentrations of fib in the environmental waters the concentrations of the target gene uida and 23 s rrna in the environmental samples as obtained by the mpn lamp and qpcr approaches are plotted in fig 6 a and 6b a regression analysis with a prediction interval showed that all the genomic dna samples of environmental water were located in the 95 prediction intervals for the target gene uida while all these samples were distributed within the 99 prediction interval for both target genes because the prediction intervals of the mpn lamp provided statistical confidence for the concentrations of target genes the mpn lamp approach could be used as a rapid detection method for assessing fecal indicator bacteria in a resource limited setting additionally the concentrations of e coli and enterococci determined using the mpn lamp and qpcr methods were normalized as gene copies per 100 ml environmental water considering volumes of environmental water samples for dna extraction and idexx tests then the normalized concentrations of e coli and enterococci using the mpn lamp and qpcr methods were compared with the results from idexx tests mpn per 100 ml in fig 6c and 6d meanwhile table s3 listed the concentrations of culturable e coli and enterococcus as measured by the idexx method fig 6c and 6d showed the linear relationship between the normalized concentrations of idexx and those of the mpn lamp and qpcr methods mpn lamp provided a higher estimation than those of idexx because idexx method measured culturable bacteria only while mpn lamp can detect both extracellular dna and intracellular dna from the culturable nonculturable and vbnc bacteria therefore the mpn lamp on a pmma microchip method is feasible for rapid and in situ monitoring of fib without sophisticated lab equipment because mpn based estimates of fib were statistically comparable with qpcr and culture dependent methods also the color changes at the end of the mpn lamp assay suggested that the mpn lamp on the pmma microchip method is suitable in resource limited environments 4 discussion the number of extreme weather events that have been associated with the contamination of water resources is forecasted to increase with climate change khan et al 2015 also aging sewer infrastructure is increasingly threatening water quality venkataramanan et al 2019 to ensure the safety of water there need to be easy rapid methods to assess a water sample s fecal contamination diseases caused by fecal contamination in water continue to cause public health crises with the challenges creating a renewed need for rapid and reliable methods to detect contamination and prevent humans from being exposed directly measuring the pathogens causing infectious diseases such as cholera and other diarrheal diseases dysenteries and enteric fevers is complicated but culture based methods for assessing fecal contamination using fib are well established and widely applied ervin et al 2013 however traditional culture dependent methods for fib require an incubation period until colonies or bacterial growth become noticeable which hinders rapid and real time monitoring of water quality recently molecular techniques including conventional pcr qpcr and digital pcr have been employed to provide a rapid and reliable assessment of fecal contamination in water cao et al 2015 purcell et al 2016 verhaegen et al 2016 these molecular methods however need complicated instruments and highly trained operators also molecular techniques for fib may be unsuitable for routine monitoring purposes except in particularly well resourced laboratories the colorimetric lamp assays as a molecular technique for fib enable the simple and visual detection pink to yellow of the amplification of e coli uida and enterococcus 23 s rrna genes using a heater one limitation of the lamp assays is a lack of providing a quantitative determination of the level of fecal contamination to address this concern we have developed a low cost rapid and easy to use approach for assessing fecal contamination in environmental water using a pmma chip we have integrated the mpn technique and lamp assay embedded into a pmma microchip to quantify fib in environmental water in this study the mpn test is most commonly applied to estimate the concentration of viable microorganisms by analyzing presences absences tests of samples divided into multiple tubes or wells cho et al 2010 microchips or microfluidic chips have been widely applied in the biological sciences and medicine because microchips not only save volumes of samples and reagents but also allow for faster reactions tarn and pamme 2011 currently diverse materials are used in fabricating microfluidic chips including silicon glass various plastics and others adsorption and inhibition of biomolecules occur when these materials interact with biomolecular reaction compounds from studies about the pcr compatibility of silicon silicon oxides glasses and plastics kodzius et al 2012 it has been determined that the pcr reaction could be inhibited by microfluidic materials because of surface interactions in the pcr wang et al 2006 it was reported that pmma or acrylic glue materials without additives e g bsa showed inhibitory effects on pcr reactions however our pmma microchips achieved successful pcr reactions without any additives e g bsa because the hydrophobic materials of pmma could inhibit pcr reaction however exposure of pmma to longwave uv a modified the pmma surface to avoid pcr inhibition of the pmma interaction also mineral oil minimized the contact between the pcr reaction components and the wall materials thus preventing further inhibition or adsorption of dna and polymerase to pmma kodzius et al 2012 molecular techniques such as pcr and qpcr can provide sensitive rapid and quantitative analytical tools that provide species specific identification of microorganisms for water quality monitoring these techniques have been widely applied to monitor microbial water in different environmental matrices such as freshwater catchment marina water and soil korajkic et al 2014 molina et al 2014 rogers et al 2011 however the weak correlation between qpcr methods and culture based methods for fib e g enterococcus was demonstrated in marine water with complex environmental matrices e g sunlight salinity culturability and others converse et al 2012 also many different pcr inhibitors found in environmental samples might affect the sensitivity of qpcr assays schrader et al 2012 it has been reported that lamp assays were less sensitive to pcr inhibitors than qpcr assays lee et al 2019 furthermore a lamp assay doesn t require sophisticated equipment and trained personnel which is a disadvantage of conventional pcr and qpcr methods lau and botella 2017 the lamp is a field deployable technique with rapid sample preparations such as in situ concentration and dna purification that doesn t use any bulky lab equipment kaneko et al 2007 lee et al 2019 the lamp s amplification profile without the initial denaturation step could be performed at a constant temperature nagamine et al 2001 moreover the lamp pcr capacitates researchers to use visual based endpoint detection for a target gene based on turbidity fluorescent signals and color changes goto et al 2009 mori and notomi 2009 in this study the colorimetric based endpoint analysis was performed using a pmma based microchip without any extra visual analysis equipment moreover the endpoints of the lamp like that of conventional pcr can provide qualitative positive or negative test results in this study the lamp associated with the mpn can quantify the target genes because mpn pcr has been shown to be a powerful tool for the quantitative detection of microorganisms in various environmental matrices such as soil food and water inoue and nakaho 2014 marian et al 2012 shi et al 2018 wang et al 2015 lamp pcr demonstrated rapid amplification of target dna with a wide range of dna concentrations with high robustness and sensitivity for environmental microbial forensics furthermore the feasibility of the mpn lamp approach for genomic dna of environmental samples was verified as most of the genomic dna of environmental samples were located in the 95 prediction interval of the standard curve of concentrations for the qpcr approach vs the results of the mpn lamp approach fig 6a and b moreover previous studies reported that the lamp assay had a similar sensitivity to the qpcr in terms of detecting parasitic infections and enterococcus spp lin et al 2012 martzy et al 2017 however because of the serial dilution of the dna molecules we achieved a high sensitivity of as few as 4 copies well using the mpn lamp given our analysis mpn lamp with dna intercalating dye treatment using propidium monoaizde ethidium monoazide and dyetox 13 green c 2 azide could be used for viability pcr to enumerate viable bacteria in the future study these dna intercalating dyes have been used to discriminate viable cells from dead cells in water lee and bae 2018 reyneke et al 2017 also like a digital pcr approach the microchip based mpn lamp could enhance the sensitivity and performance by developing the microchip with low volume and high throughput readout positive negative as the endpoints with a microfluid chip design and smartphone image analysis ahmad et al 2017 we recently developed a portable lamp device with a syringe filter based dna extraction method that could detect the presence of fib within 1 h without any laboratory equipment in which the syringe filter based dna extraction step required 30 min lee et al 2019 together with the syringe filter dna extraction method a portable pcr device facilitates rapid quantification of fib using the mpn lamp approach for microbial water quality testing in the low resource setting thus a further study would be necessary for integrating in situ dna extraction method and a portable pcr device compatible with the mpn lamp microchip in the resource limited setting the microfluidic chip platform in a low resource setting can be useful for not only quantifying fib but also for directly detecting waterborne pathogens in field water quality monitoring conclusion the mpn lamp assay with the pmma based microchip was developed to assess the fecal contamination by quantifying the target genes of fecal indicator bacteria including e coli and enterococcus in a water environment the high correlation coefficients of the results from the mpn lamp approach and those from qpcr validated the feasibility of the mpn lamp approach and demonstrated the reliability of the quantitative estimation of the mpn lamp method the quantitative estimation of fecal indicator bacteria in a water sample can be performed without an expensive and complicated system making this method a good choice for microbial quality monitoring in areas that have limited resources the colorimetric lamp assay provided a highly sensitive and clear positive negative observation on the pmma microchips indicating its great potential to be applied to a sample to answer

16971,fecal contamination of water and its associated pathogens are a major public health concern in both developing and industrialized areas fecal indicator bacteria fib are commonly used to assess microbial water quality but they require a relatively long period of incubation time currently molecular techniques have been applied to rapidly detect fib however these molecular techniques require expensive and sophisticated equipment in this study we developed a rapid on chip gene quantification method based on loop mediated isothermal amplification lamp pcr the lamp assays can measure the target genes of the fecal indicator bacteria fib including e coli and enterococcus spp using the most probable number mpn approach the colorimetric lamp assay allows for naked eye observation of the pcr reaction as few as 4 gene copies well when the reaction ends mpn measurement of positive outcomes on the white based pmma polymethacrylic acid microchips provides the concentrations of the target genes of fib with a confidence interval we validated the feasibility of the mpn lamp approach by obtaining a strong correlation between the results of the mpn estimations and the qpcr analysis moreover the mpn lamp approach was used to quantify the fib in different environmental water collected from the freshwater reservoirs beach agriculture farm and sewage our research demonstrates that the mpn lamp method enables us to easily and quickly quantifying fib genes isolated from the environment without expensive qpcr instruments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords loop mediated isothermal amplification most probable number pmma microchip fecal indicator bacteria 1 introduction fecal contamination is a serious threat to public health in both developing and industrialized countries diverse groups of enteric pathogens transmitted through human and animal feces can cause outbreaks of waterborne disease the threat to human and environmental health posed by fecal contamination is usually evaluated by measuring the concentrations of fecal indicator bacteria fib fib such as fecal coliforms escherichia coli and enterococcus are monitored by culture dependent methods that require a microbiological laboratory and overnight incubation bae and wuertz 2009 however culture based fib methods are limited in detecting the viable but non culturable vbnc state so the water sampled could retain its pathogenicity lee and bae 2017 another constraint associated with culture based fib methods delay in providing results due to the overnight incubation requirement which hinders early warnings and the timely implementation of measures for controlling or mitigating contamination noble and weisberg 2005 thus there has been a growing demand for rapid detection techniques that can determine the microbiological quality of water used for drinking bathing or irrigation li et al 2020 to address the limitations of the culture dependent methods dna based approaches like the polymerase chain reaction pcr have been used to rapidly assess microbial contamination in an environment converse et al 2012 for example a quantitative pcr qpcr method was implemented by the us environmental protection agency usepa to molecularly detect enterococci this method is now used to perform routine water quality monitoring in recreational water u s epa 2015 however pcr based approaches for fib monitoring highly rely on access to a large modern laboratory skilled personnel and expensive equipment resulting in preventing the in field and rapid assessment of water quality recently a technique called the loop mediated isothermal amplification lamp assay has been introduced to rapidly detect target genes martzy et al 2017 lamp is highly sensitive because it is tolerant of common pcr inhibitors from water lee et al 2019 notomi et al 2000 lamp reactions can be conducted under isothermal conditions ranging from 60 c to 65 c using a regular laboratory bath or a heat block instead of needing costly equipment such as a thermal cycler ghosh et al 2015 moreover unlike a conventional pcr if a dna intercalating dye is added to the lamp reagent e g sybr green i ethidium bromide hydroxyl naphthol blue hnb the endpoint color changes caused by lamp amplification can easily be confirmed with the naked eye iwamoto et al 2003 nagamine et al 2002 tomlinson et al 2010 thus lamp has been used as an alternative point of care testing tool for a wide variety of applications including pcr lin et al 2012 despite being easy for researchers to use and the benefits of the method using low cost equipment in resource limited settings lee et al 2019 a lamp assay s main limitation in microbial water quality assessment is quantifying target microorganisms the most probable number mpn pcr method has been used as an alternative to quantitative pcr qpcr when determining the concentration of fib in water ishii et al 2006 schulz et al 2010 wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 zhao et al 2014 while qpcr has advantages including higher precision and no post pcr processing mpn pcr on the other hand is a simple and sensitive method that doesn t require special software and costly instruments sharma et al 2007 mpn pcr has been used for the quantitative detection of microorganisms in the soil water and food samples henry et al 2015 inoue and nakaho 2014 robert pillot et al 2010 savill et al 2001 the aim of this study therefore was to implement microchip based lamp pcr to quantify fib in water in this study a polymethyl methacrylate pmma based microchip was designed because it is low cost easy to fabricate and saves pcr reagents sun et al 2007 the objectives of this study were i to validate the mpn lamp on the pmma microchip ii to evaluate the mpn lamp approach of quantifying target genes of fib by comparing it with qpcr results and iii to use the microchip based mpn lamp assays to monitor fecal contamination in environmental samples 2 materials and methods 2 1 design and fabrication of a microchip the microchips were fabricated using polymethyl methacrylate pmma sheets the microchip consisted of three layers a spacer layer a wells layer and a base layer figure s1 shows an overview of the microchip fabrication with details about each layer 1 mm thick transparent pmma sheets were used for the wells layer and spacer layer while 2 mm thick white pmma sheets were utilized for the base layer the pmma sheets were fabricated by laser cutting and were then cleaned with 70 ethanol for downstream bonding processes then the base layer wells layer and spacer layer were bonded in sequence to achieve the final microchip figure s1 norland optical adhesive 65 noa65 was used to bond three layers of pmma with 5 min exposure to longwave uv a the microchips were air dried at 70 c in an oven before usage 2 2 bacterial strains and culture conditions e coli and enterococcus faecalis were used as target microorganisms to evaluate the effectiveness of the microchip based mpn lamp assays e coli and e faecalis v583 were cultured in luria bertani lb broth and brain heart infusion bhi broth sigma aldrich usa respectively the bacterial cells were incubated at 37 c for 16 h while being shaken at 200 rpm 2 3 pcr and standard curve preparation genomic dna of e coli and e faecalis v583 were extracted using dneasy blood tissue kits qiagen according to the manufacturer s protocol a conventional pcr was performed with two outer primers of lamp f3 and b3 table s1 to amplify the target genes of uida e coli and 23 s rrna e faecalis the pcr reaction was performed in a total volume of 25 μl containing 2 dream taq green pcr master mix thermo fisher scientific usa 5 μm forward and reverse primers dna template and nuclease free water the pcr reactions were performed on a veriti 96 well fast thermal cycler applied biosystem ca usa and the thermal cycling conditions were carried out under the following program initial denaturation at 95 c for 3 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 c for 30 s 60 c for 30 s and 72 c for 1 min and finally an extension step of 72 c for 10 min for standard curve preparation the pcr products were purified using the agencourt ampure pcr purification system agencourt bioscience corporation before the pcr products were inserted into a linearized plasmid vector pcr 2 1 subsequently plasmids were cloned into chemically competent e coli by using the ta cloningtm kit invitrogen thermo fisher scientific the plasmids containing the pcr amplicons were extracted from recombinant e coli using the genejet plasmid miniprep kit thermo fisher scientific us the concentrations of purified plasmids were further measured by the qubit double stranded dna dsdna high sensitivity hs assay kit the standard curves were generated using a serial 10 fold dilution of the pcr 2 1 plasmids vector containing the target genes the uida and 23 s rrna 2 4 measurement of fib in environmental water environmental water samples n 1 per location were collected from a beach an agricultural farm a freshwater reservoir and from two sewer manholes in singapore and immediately transported to the laboratory e coli and enterococcus were enumerated using the culture based methods colilert 18 and enterolert according to the manufacturer s recommendations idexx laboratories inc usa briefly one packet of reagent powder from a colilert or enterolert kit was dissolved in a 100 ml water sample in a sterile non fluorescing vessel the mixture was poured into a multi well tray quanti tray 2000 and sealed with an idexx quanti tray sealer the sealed tray was incubated at 37 c for colilerttm or 41 c for enterolerttm for 24 h respectively results were reported as the most probable number mpn per 100 ml of water according to the manufacturer s tables 2 5 genomic dna preparation from environmental sample genomic dna was extracted from environmental samples so the lamp mpn and qpcr assays could quantify the concentration of fib in water 30 l water samples from the beach agriculture farm and freshwater reservoir and a 5 l water sample from the sewer were used for the downstream processing of concentration determination after pre treatment of a blocking buffer filter sterilized 5 calf serum to a standard high flux f series dialyzer fresenius polysulfone hf80s fresenius medical care the environmental water samples were loaded into the dialyzer to concentrate water samples using a vacuum pump gardner denver wuxi china then 200 ml of elution buffer 4 m urea 50 mm lysine ph 9 0 was applied to elute the substances out subsequently a 10 ml eluted solution was filtered using a cn cellulose nitrate membrane filter of 0 22 µm pore size filterbio nantong china to separate the microbes on the membrane filter afterward the dna extraction from the membrane filter was conducted using dneasy powersoil kit with the equipment including vortex adaptor disruptor genie bohemia usa and centrifuge thermofisher scientific osterode germany fig 1 then the dna concentrations of extract from the environmental samples were measured via thermo scientific nanodrop 2000 table s2 dna samples of 200 µl were stored at 20 c before being analyzed 2 6 lamp assay on the microchip all primers were synthesized by integrated dna technologies idt singapore all the primers used in this study are listed in table s1 the lamp assay on the microchip s procedure is illustrated in fig 1 in detail either the plasmid dna or genomic dna extracted from the environmental samples were first prepared in a series of 5 fold serial dilutions the 5 fold dilution was repeated 4 times in a row to achieve five levels of diluted subsamples including one with an initial concentration and four with diluted concentrations each reaction mixture contained 5 μl reagents including warmstart lamp 2x master mix new england biolabs singapore 10x lamp primer mix 1 6 μm fip and bip 0 2 μm f3 and b3 and 0 4 μm of the lf and lb 0 2 μl dna subsamples and nuclease free water then 1 μl from the 5 μl reaction mixture was distributed into each well five replicates were prepared for each dilution level for the five tube mpn analysis the negative control was placed in parallel for each microchip after injecting reaction mixture into wells the mineral oil was covered over the reaction wells to prevent evaporation during the pcr reaction the lamp pcr reactions were carried out using a proflex 2 x flat pcr system applied biosystem ca usa for 35 min at 65 c and 61 c for uida e coli and 23 s rrna enterococcus spp respectively in the present study 35 min of lamp pcr reactions were applied as the additional heating did not provide an additional positive reaction the phenol red worked as a visible ph indicator in the lamp reaction the decreasing ph due to the accumulation of proton in the positive lamp reaction would turn the phenol red into yellow thus the results were confirmed positive when the color in a well turned from clear pink to yellow the endpoint lamp reaction image was recorded by a smartphone 2 7 quantitative pcr qpcr quantitative pcr qpcr reactions were conducted on an applied biosystems step one plus real time pcr system applied biosystems ca usa the real time pcr system quantified the two target genes of uida e coli and 23 s rrna e faecalis for the environmental water samples and was used to construct standard curves the reaction mixtures consisted of 10 μl 2 poweruptm sybr green master mix applied biosystems austin tx 2 μl of dna template either plasmid dna or environmental genomic dna 0 25 μm of forward and reverse primers table s1 and nuclease free water quantitative pcr was carried out using the following thermocycling conditions 95 c for 3 min 40 cycles of 30 s at 95 c 30 s at 60 c and 60 s at 72 c a melting curve analysis was conducted to confirm the specificity of the amplified product 2 8 data analysis mpn calculation in this study mpn was quantified based on a statistical approach using the formula shown below to calculate the gene copy number μ i 1 k d i p i v i 1 exp d i μ v i i 1 k d i n i v i the standard deviation sd of estimated μ was calculated by the following formula hurley and roscoe 1983 jarvis et al 2010 sd v a r μ i 1 k p i d i v i 2 exp d i μ v i 1 exp d i μ v i 2 1 2 in these equations k is the levels of dilution d i is the dilution factor p i is the number of positive subsamples n i is the total number of subsamples and v i is the volume of each reaction according to the experiment design in this study the volume of each reaction v i is 1 μl in each well and the total number of subsamples n i are 5 due to the 5 fold serial dilution and the dilution caused by master mix and primer mix reagents in the reaction the dilution factors d i for the 5 levels of subsamples are 0 04 0 008 0 0016 0 00032 and 0 000064 respectively we assume that the target genes are randomly distributed in the subsamples the numbers of target genes in wells are independent and the wells containing at least one target gene are positive after the reaction in this study the experiment design includes 5 dilution levels while only 3 digits are adopted when calculating the mpn based on the following rules i if the wells in several successive dilution levels are all positive the calculation starts with the most diluted level ii remove the dilution level if it and the next lower dilution level have all negative wells as long as this condition has least four dilution levels remaining iii continue to remove these dilution levels until only three dilution levels remain ahmad et al 2017 based on the principles of mpn demonstrated above we developed an mpn calculator an excel file of mpn estimation using the parameters in the present study mpn calculator xlsx supplementary information the adopted dilution levels for mpn calculation were decided based on the rules outlined above followed by inputting the number of positive subsamples and corresponding dilution factors the mpn calculator can provide us with the mpn and the 95 confidence limits 3 result 3 1 evaluation of mpn lamp on a pmma microchip in this study fib was enumerated using the mpn lamp method on a pmma microchip to develop a simple and field deployable approach to assess microbial contamination in water the genes uida of e coli and 23 s rrna of enterococcus were used to detect fib on the pmma microchip with corresponding lamp assays to achieve the isothermal pcr for e coli and enterococcus the optimal temperatures for isothermal pcr amplifications were 65 c and 61 c for target genes of uida and 23 s rrna the pcr amplification was confirmed within 35 mins with the pmma microchip in fig 2 the color changes in the lamp assays indicate successful lamp amplification suggesting that the pmma did not inhibit the lamp pcr reactions five replicates of positive and negative pcr reactions were conducted at different concentrations of plasmid dna as shown in fig 2 for both target genes of uida and 23 s rrna all positives turned yellow at concentrations equal to or higher than 104 copies μl and the nominal concentrations in the wells were no less than 400 copies well in these same reactions all the negative controls remained pink moreover the limit of detection lod was less than 102 copies resulting in 102 copies μl plasmid dna considering the dilution factor the nominal concentration was 4 copies well indicating a good sensitivity of the lamp assays on the microchip due to the sensitivity of the lamp assays a minor deviation in mpn calculation may occur when the concentration of the target is closed to lod furthermore correlations between the number of the positive and the diluted plasmid dna were on the microchip demonstrating that the diluted dna was distributed randomly within the microchip and target gene were independently present in each well 3 2 correlation of mpn lamp calculation and qpcr quantification the results from the mpn lamp pcr were compared to the results from the qpcr to estimate the most probable number of target genes in plasmid dna samples given the positive results in the dilution series fig 3 illustrates the number of positive results from the mpn lamp pcrs on microchips where each pmma chip contains different concentrations of the plasmid dna of enterococcus 23 s rrna and e coli uida respectively the wells with negative reactions shown in pink appeared at the highest dilution levels when concentrations were at 106 copies µl indicating that the concentration of the plasmid dna 106 copies µl did not exceed the upper bound on the concentration thus the quantification range of the target gene concentrations was from 102 to 106 copies μl the mpn lamp pcr was calculated based on the numbers of positive and negative reactions at different dilution levels the positive counts and the dilution level for each concentration were used to calculate mpn results with confidence limits in fig 3 the mpn results with lower and upper 95 confidence limits showed a corresponding relationship with the plasmid concentrations thus the correlation between the plasmid concentration and the calculated mpn results was determined using a fitting curve analysis fig 4 demonstrates a linear relationship between the plasmid concentration and the mpn estimation with the slope equal to 1 21 and 1 33 for 23 s rrna and uida respectively r2 0 99 the strong correlation between the concentrations of plasmid dna and calculated mpn indicated the high feasibility of using the mpn lamp approach on a pmma microchip to estimate the concentration of fib in water 3 3 mpn lamp on environmental samples genomic dna of environmental water samples from four different surface water including raw sewage beach agricultural runoff and reservoir water was used to validate the mpn lamp approach the mpn lamp assays on microchips were performed to enumerate 23 s rrna and uida genes as a proxy for fecal contaminations in environmental waters the mpn images as outcomes of lamp reactions in each well were analyzed to count positive reactions in serial dilutions fig 5 a the positive reaction counts over the number of total wells at each dilution level are listed in fig 5b mpns with a 95 confidence limit of target genes were calculated based on the positive reaction counts at dilution levels as shown in fig 5b the mpn images of both 23 s rrna and uida assay in genomic dna of raw sewage showed all positive reactions in the first dilution levels for the dna sample of beach water the concentration of enterococcus was higher than that of e coli as enterococcus is more persistent in marine water the mpn analysis for e coli uida in the genomic dna of the reservoir sample displayed all negative reactions while the concentration of enterococcus 23 s rrna was 1 02 102 gene copies µl thus the mpn lamp using the microchip can be applied to rapidly estimate fecal contamination under different environment matrixes furthermore the qpcr assays for e coli uida and enterococcus 23 s rrna genes were performed in parallel with the mpn lamp to compare the concentrations of fib in the environmental waters the concentrations of the target gene uida and 23 s rrna in the environmental samples as obtained by the mpn lamp and qpcr approaches are plotted in fig 6 a and 6b a regression analysis with a prediction interval showed that all the genomic dna samples of environmental water were located in the 95 prediction intervals for the target gene uida while all these samples were distributed within the 99 prediction interval for both target genes because the prediction intervals of the mpn lamp provided statistical confidence for the concentrations of target genes the mpn lamp approach could be used as a rapid detection method for assessing fecal indicator bacteria in a resource limited setting additionally the concentrations of e coli and enterococci determined using the mpn lamp and qpcr methods were normalized as gene copies per 100 ml environmental water considering volumes of environmental water samples for dna extraction and idexx tests then the normalized concentrations of e coli and enterococci using the mpn lamp and qpcr methods were compared with the results from idexx tests mpn per 100 ml in fig 6c and 6d meanwhile table s3 listed the concentrations of culturable e coli and enterococcus as measured by the idexx method fig 6c and 6d showed the linear relationship between the normalized concentrations of idexx and those of the mpn lamp and qpcr methods mpn lamp provided a higher estimation than those of idexx because idexx method measured culturable bacteria only while mpn lamp can detect both extracellular dna and intracellular dna from the culturable nonculturable and vbnc bacteria therefore the mpn lamp on a pmma microchip method is feasible for rapid and in situ monitoring of fib without sophisticated lab equipment because mpn based estimates of fib were statistically comparable with qpcr and culture dependent methods also the color changes at the end of the mpn lamp assay suggested that the mpn lamp on the pmma microchip method is suitable in resource limited environments 4 discussion the number of extreme weather events that have been associated with the contamination of water resources is forecasted to increase with climate change khan et al 2015 also aging sewer infrastructure is increasingly threatening water quality venkataramanan et al 2019 to ensure the safety of water there need to be easy rapid methods to assess a water sample s fecal contamination diseases caused by fecal contamination in water continue to cause public health crises with the challenges creating a renewed need for rapid and reliable methods to detect contamination and prevent humans from being exposed directly measuring the pathogens causing infectious diseases such as cholera and other diarrheal diseases dysenteries and enteric fevers is complicated but culture based methods for assessing fecal contamination using fib are well established and widely applied ervin et al 2013 however traditional culture dependent methods for fib require an incubation period until colonies or bacterial growth become noticeable which hinders rapid and real time monitoring of water quality recently molecular techniques including conventional pcr qpcr and digital pcr have been employed to provide a rapid and reliable assessment of fecal contamination in water cao et al 2015 purcell et al 2016 verhaegen et al 2016 these molecular methods however need complicated instruments and highly trained operators also molecular techniques for fib may be unsuitable for routine monitoring purposes except in particularly well resourced laboratories the colorimetric lamp assays as a molecular technique for fib enable the simple and visual detection pink to yellow of the amplification of e coli uida and enterococcus 23 s rrna genes using a heater one limitation of the lamp assays is a lack of providing a quantitative determination of the level of fecal contamination to address this concern we have developed a low cost rapid and easy to use approach for assessing fecal contamination in environmental water using a pmma chip we have integrated the mpn technique and lamp assay embedded into a pmma microchip to quantify fib in environmental water in this study the mpn test is most commonly applied to estimate the concentration of viable microorganisms by analyzing presences absences tests of samples divided into multiple tubes or wells cho et al 2010 microchips or microfluidic chips have been widely applied in the biological sciences and medicine because microchips not only save volumes of samples and reagents but also allow for faster reactions tarn and pamme 2011 currently diverse materials are used in fabricating microfluidic chips including silicon glass various plastics and others adsorption and inhibition of biomolecules occur when these materials interact with biomolecular reaction compounds from studies about the pcr compatibility of silicon silicon oxides glasses and plastics kodzius et al 2012 it has been determined that the pcr reaction could be inhibited by microfluidic materials because of surface interactions in the pcr wang et al 2006 it was reported that pmma or acrylic glue materials without additives e g bsa showed inhibitory effects on pcr reactions however our pmma microchips achieved successful pcr reactions without any additives e g bsa because the hydrophobic materials of pmma could inhibit pcr reaction however exposure of pmma to longwave uv a modified the pmma surface to avoid pcr inhibition of the pmma interaction also mineral oil minimized the contact between the pcr reaction components and the wall materials thus preventing further inhibition or adsorption of dna and polymerase to pmma kodzius et al 2012 molecular techniques such as pcr and qpcr can provide sensitive rapid and quantitative analytical tools that provide species specific identification of microorganisms for water quality monitoring these techniques have been widely applied to monitor microbial water in different environmental matrices such as freshwater catchment marina water and soil korajkic et al 2014 molina et al 2014 rogers et al 2011 however the weak correlation between qpcr methods and culture based methods for fib e g enterococcus was demonstrated in marine water with complex environmental matrices e g sunlight salinity culturability and others converse et al 2012 also many different pcr inhibitors found in environmental samples might affect the sensitivity of qpcr assays schrader et al 2012 it has been reported that lamp assays were less sensitive to pcr inhibitors than qpcr assays lee et al 2019 furthermore a lamp assay doesn t require sophisticated equipment and trained personnel which is a disadvantage of conventional pcr and qpcr methods lau and botella 2017 the lamp is a field deployable technique with rapid sample preparations such as in situ concentration and dna purification that doesn t use any bulky lab equipment kaneko et al 2007 lee et al 2019 the lamp s amplification profile without the initial denaturation step could be performed at a constant temperature nagamine et al 2001 moreover the lamp pcr capacitates researchers to use visual based endpoint detection for a target gene based on turbidity fluorescent signals and color changes goto et al 2009 mori and notomi 2009 in this study the colorimetric based endpoint analysis was performed using a pmma based microchip without any extra visual analysis equipment moreover the endpoints of the lamp like that of conventional pcr can provide qualitative positive or negative test results in this study the lamp associated with the mpn can quantify the target genes because mpn pcr has been shown to be a powerful tool for the quantitative detection of microorganisms in various environmental matrices such as soil food and water inoue and nakaho 2014 marian et al 2012 shi et al 2018 wang et al 2015 lamp pcr demonstrated rapid amplification of target dna with a wide range of dna concentrations with high robustness and sensitivity for environmental microbial forensics furthermore the feasibility of the mpn lamp approach for genomic dna of environmental samples was verified as most of the genomic dna of environmental samples were located in the 95 prediction interval of the standard curve of concentrations for the qpcr approach vs the results of the mpn lamp approach fig 6a and b moreover previous studies reported that the lamp assay had a similar sensitivity to the qpcr in terms of detecting parasitic infections and enterococcus spp lin et al 2012 martzy et al 2017 however because of the serial dilution of the dna molecules we achieved a high sensitivity of as few as 4 copies well using the mpn lamp given our analysis mpn lamp with dna intercalating dye treatment using propidium monoaizde ethidium monoazide and dyetox 13 green c 2 azide could be used for viability pcr to enumerate viable bacteria in the future study these dna intercalating dyes have been used to discriminate viable cells from dead cells in water lee and bae 2018 reyneke et al 2017 also like a digital pcr approach the microchip based mpn lamp could enhance the sensitivity and performance by developing the microchip with low volume and high throughput readout positive negative as the endpoints with a microfluid chip design and smartphone image analysis ahmad et al 2017 we recently developed a portable lamp device with a syringe filter based dna extraction method that could detect the presence of fib within 1 h without any laboratory equipment in which the syringe filter based dna extraction step required 30 min lee et al 2019 together with the syringe filter dna extraction method a portable pcr device facilitates rapid quantification of fib using the mpn lamp approach for microbial water quality testing in the low resource setting thus a further study would be necessary for integrating in situ dna extraction method and a portable pcr device compatible with the mpn lamp microchip in the resource limited setting the microfluidic chip platform in a low resource setting can be useful for not only quantifying fib but also for directly detecting waterborne pathogens in field water quality monitoring conclusion the mpn lamp assay with the pmma based microchip was developed to assess the fecal contamination by quantifying the target genes of fecal indicator bacteria including e coli and enterococcus in a water environment the high correlation coefficients of the results from the mpn lamp approach and those from qpcr validated the feasibility of the mpn lamp approach and demonstrated the reliability of the quantitative estimation of the mpn lamp method the quantitative estimation of fecal indicator bacteria in a water sample can be performed without an expensive and complicated system making this method a good choice for microbial quality monitoring in areas that have limited resources the colorimetric lamp assay provided a highly sensitive and clear positive negative observation on the pmma microchips indicating its great potential to be applied to a sample to answer

16972,phosphorus p is an irreplaceable element playing a vital role in living organisms yet has limited earth reserves the possibility of p recovery from wastewaters by electrochemically induced calcium phosphate precipitation ecapp was demonstrated previously the current study presents a novel scalable prototype consisting of a column shaped electrochemical reactor a tubular stainless steel cathode and a pt coated ti anode the adhesion of solids to the cathode important for product recovery was shown not to be negatively impacted by electrodes vertical placement the influence of current density hydraulic retention time hrt and initial phosphate concentration in this prototype were examined under continuous flow operation the system accomplished the highest p removal rate 1267 mg day at 1 5 d hrt and 800 ma in treating undiluted cheese wastewater with 48 5 kwh kg p moreover the prototype showed high stability and efficiency 50 over 173 days of continuous operation without performing maintenance after turning off the current 0 ma the system realized a surprising p removal jump up to 97 3 revealing the delayed diffusion of hydroxide ions by the deposition layer the calculation of capex and opex of ecapp in treating 100 m3 cheese wastewater per week indicates that the ecapp plant can realize net positive from the 12th year the recovered solids have relatively high p content 9wt and insignificant contamination of heavy metals overall the proven suitability of the scalable prototype can pave the way towards the actual adoption of the ecapp process graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords phosphate removal continuous flow operation energy consumption calcium phosphate ph cheese wastewater 1 introduction phosphorus p is an irreplaceable element for all living organisms for humans p is linked to gene expression i e rna and energy carrier i e atp and is one of the major elements in bones the only p source for plants is the soil which needs regular replenishment with artificial p fertilizer indeed our modern agriculture industry heavily depends on fertilization to maintain crop yield to feed the increasing global population cordell et al 2009 in this context phosphate rock mining is essential elser and bennett 2011 unfortunately phosphate rock is a finite resource and the runoff of p results in an environmental problem namely eutrophication schindler et al 2016 therefore the lost p in waste streams needs to be removed and recycled as a supplementary p source elser and bennett 2011 mayer et al 2016 the well established p removal processes include enhanced biological p removal adsorption chemical precipitation coagulation and fluidized bed crystallization desmidt et al 2015 le et al 2021 melia et al 2017 morse et al 1998 while each approach has its merits and drawbacks the principle is the same the transfer of dissolved p ions from liquid to a solid phase so it can be readily recovered in recent years electrochemical techniques ets attract increasing attention as the next generation facilities for decentralized wastewater treatment especially for rural areas and isolated communities brillas et al 2009 radjenovic and sedlak 2015 xu et al 2020 in the realm of phosphate removal and recovery advanced ets such as capacitive deionization bian et al 2020 huang et al 2014 electrodialysis paltrinieri et al 2019 zhang et al 2013 and electrochemically induced precipitation have been proposed lei 2019 among those ets electrochemically induced calcium phosphate precipitation ecapp has been shown effective in complicated waste streams such as domestic wastewater lei et al 2018a anaerobic digestion effluent takabe et al 2020 and cheese wastewater lei et al 2021 the unique advantage of the ecapp approach is that it does not require the addition of chemicals more importantly it can work at a broad range of ph including acidic solutions by creating a local high ph environment close to the cathode in contrast charge dependent electrochemical separation of phosphate i e capacitive deionization is highly sensitive to ph because ph determines phosphate speciation in bulk solutions bian et al 2020 moreover the products of the ecapp approach are relatively dense calcium phosphate containing solids compared to chemical sludge therefore the products can be easily collected while electrochemically mediated struvite formation is also possible kruk et al 2014 wang et al 2010 it suffers from the need of dosing mg2 as most waste streams deviate from a satisfied mg2 nh4 po4 3 stoichiometric ratio hovelmann and putnis 2016 by contrast calcium is an abundant ion in both natural and engineered water bodies additionally calcium phosphate is a preferred product for the fertilizer industry as it is similar in composition to phosphate rocks and fits with the existing p fertilizer production processes tervahauta et al 2014 on top of p fertilizers other value added products such as h3po4 can be made with the recovered calcium phosphate solids meesschaert et al 2020 previous studies explored the mechanism of ecapp and identified the importance of local ph with synthetic solutions lei et al 2017 the feasibility of ecapp for treating domestic wastewater was also evaluated from the perspective of removal efficiency energy efficiency and the quality of recovered solids the ecapp system achieved up to 90 recovery of p as calcium phosphate nonetheless the recovered solids have a low p content which is because of the low p concentration 10 mg l compared to bicarbonate 120 mg l in domestic wastewaters leading to the significant coprecipitation of caco3 lei et al 2018a moreover the low p concentration also results in high energy consumption lei et al 2019b hence it was suggested that the target application of ecapp should be acidic p rich waste streams such as effluents from phosphorus acid production factories and some food wastewaters lei et al 2021 recently investigated the possibility of ecapp in cheese wastewater characterized by high salinity high cod and an acidic environment ph 5 0 even in non optimized conditions the specific energy consumption was significantly reduced to 67 kwh kg p in treating cheese wastewater nonetheless several challenges need to be addressed before scaling up first from an engineering point of view the horizontal placement of electrodes with the cathode at the bottom and the anode at the top is not suitable for upscaling the reactor needs to be disconnected so that the solids on the cathode can be collected second the use of a noble metal coated electrode as the cathode needs to be replaced with cheap inert electrodes to make the process economically attractive third all previous studies were performed in batch mode there is a lack of evidence for the long term stability of ecapp in particular it remains unclear how the buildup of initial deposits on the cathode affects subsequent deposition will the removal efficiency be reduced after the cathode is covered by accumulated deposits to this end a novel column shaped electrochemical reactor was built the reactor consists of a tubular stainless steel cathode which is cheap and provides a large surface area for precipitation moreover it is possible to realize the automatic collection of deposits without disconnecting the reactor firstly the feasibility of this new configuration was explored secondly the influence of operational conditions was evaluated in the continuous flow mode in the end the long term performance and stability of this system which is of great importance towards upscaling were assessed overall this study moves one step further from the understanding of precipitation mechanism to the demonstration of the ecapp system in long term continuous flow operation at conditions relevant for potential upscaling for large volumes of wastewater 2 methods and materials 2 1 materials the real cheese wastewater was collected from a local industrial wastewater treatment plant groningen the netherlands and stored in a 4 c fridge the physicochemical characteristics table s1 were analyzed immediately after sampling all anodes were purchased from magneto special anodes b v the netherlands the stainless steel cathode was received for free from lascon b v heerenveen the netherlands 2 2 prototype design in this study two prototype reactors were constructed one with a working volume of 4 0 l and the other one with 2 8 l as shown in fig 1 a the 4 0 l prototype consists of a glass reactor a tubular shaped stainless steel cathode height 38 cm diameter 9 cm thickness 0 1 cm a ru ir coated titanium sheet anode 63 cm length 2 cm width and several inlets and outlets distributed at the top and bottom section of the glass reactor which allows wastewater in out and mixing the tubular cathode was placed vertically close to the reactor s inside wall while the anode was placed in the middle of the reactor for a uniform current distribution all tests were performed at room temperature 23 1 c under constant current mode by a direct current power supply est 150 delta electronics b v the cheese wastewater flows through the reactor in an up flow configuration with a feed pump masterflex the wastewater inside the reactor was mixed with a pump at a circulation rate of 200 ml min the 2 8 l prototype electrochemical cell was configured similarly fig 1b the possible effect of the meshed configuration on cathode was investigated in pre tests in which an insignificant impact was observed therefore a tubular cathode with a 35 4 open area was applied in this 2 8 l reactor from an economic point of view consistent with the 4 0 l reactor inert material pt coated titanium rod was selected as the anode moreover the 2 8 l reactor is a closed system which is not open to the air in this case the collection of cathode produced h2 and anode produced cl2 were considered at the top of the prototype there is an outlet connected to a bottle filled with 1 m naoh solution used for cl2 adsorption the actual image of the 2 8 l reactor is presented in figure s1a 2 3 feasibility and influence of operational conditions first the feasibility of the new cathode configuration with the 4 0 l electrochemical cell was investigated with a five days test in batch mode the influences of operational conditions including current 200 400 600 800 ma hrt 1 1 5 3 d and phosphate concentration x1 x2 x10 dilution factor were explored with the 4 0 l reactor under continuous flow operation mode on studying the influence of current a two week test with a fixed hrt of 3 d for each current was performed on studying the influence of hrt the system was run for one week under constant current 800 ma for each hrt on studying the influence of phosphate concentration the raw wastewater was diluted two or ten times with demi water table 1 summarizes the operational conditions at different stages liquid samples were taken from the feed and effluent tanks regularly it is worth noting that the system takes a couple of days to stabilize after altering the operational conditions during the test hence the prototype reactor s performance was evaluated based on samples taken at the stationary state in each testing period 2 4 long term stability the 2 8 l prototype reactor was used to study the system s performance under long term continuous flow operation the system was run at 600 ma and 3 d hrt based on the preliminary tests from day 1 to day 30 the prototype s performance was monitored over 173 days of operation fig 2 gives a schematic diagram of the process the cheese wastewater was pumped to the reactor at a flow rate of 0 93 l d from a feed tank refilled periodically with cheese wastewater that was stored in the fridge the wastewater inside the reactor was mixed with a circulation pump at a flow rate of 200 ml min liquid samples were taken from the influent and effluent regularly in which the ph concentrations of ca mg and p were analyzed it is worth mentioning that no maintenance was performed over 173 days of operation after 151 days of operation the system was switched to an open circuit 0 ma for two weeks 2 5 liquid analysis the ph and conductivity were monitored by a ph conductivity meter seven excellence s470 mettler toledo the concentrations of p ca k and mg were quantified by icp aes optima 5300 dv perkin elmer the concentrations of anions po4 3 cl and so4 2 and na were measured by ion chromatography compact ic 761 metrohm equipped with a metrosep a supp 4 5 guard precolumn a metrohm metrosep a 122 supp 5 150 4 0 mm column and a conductivity detector all liquid samples for icp aes and ic analysis were filtrated by 0 45 μm membrane filters after proper dilution cod total nitrogen and ammonium in cheese wastewater were determined using cuvette lck 114 150 1000 mg l lck 138 1 16 mg l and lck 304 0 02 2 50 mg l respectively following the standard procedures proposed by hach germany 2 6 solids characterization in both reactors the bottom collected solids were obtained from the bottom of the reactor regularly the collected solids were first washed with demi water and then dried in the oven at 105 c for 24 h the solids were characterized with xrd for determining their phase and crystallinity the quantification of the elemental composition of the solids was realized by combining acid digestion and icp aes analysis briefly 0 1 g solids were dissolved in 5 ml hno3 69 and then appropriately diluted for elemental analysis with icp aes 2 7 calculations the removal efficiency of the ions was calculated with equation 1 1 remo val effi cien cy 100 c inf c eff c inf where cinf and ceff are the ions concentration in the influent and effluent respectively the energy consumption in the electrochemical system was calculated as equation 2 2 w k w h u i t where u is the recorded cell voltage v i is the set current a t is the electrolysis time h the specific energy consumption is defined by the consumed electricity kwh and recovered phosphorus kg under a particular time frame 2 8 scenario calculation the opex and capex of treating 100 m3per week cheese wastewater using ecapp technology were calculated 3 results and discussion 3 1 feasibility of tubular configuration previously the cathode was placed horizontally against the anode figure s1b this type of electrode configuration allows the direct deposition of solids on the cathode partially due to gravity however this type of design is not suitable for large scale applications in collecting deposits in practice a tubular structure is ideal for continuous flow operation and to maximize the ratio between the cathode surface area and the cell volume m2 m3 while this may benefit the cleaning of electrodes it is unclear how this affects the behavior of precipitated solids because of gravity and water flow the precipitates may detach automatically from the cathode in light of the low cheese wastewater ph the detached solids may dissolve to explore this we performed a single batch test with this new design and compared the results with a previously studied horizontal electrode configuration it was found that fortunately the solids did not detach from the cathode automatically fig 3 shows the removal of phosphate is highly efficient in this new design compared to the previous design the new reactor achieves comparable phosphate removal efficiency 94 3 vs 93 3 while treating more wastewater 4 0 l vs 0 9 l in an equal time interval and equal current the removal of ca and mg was also comparable to the previous system after 96 h treatment 89 4 of ca and 82 7 of mg were removed overall the results show that the attachment of solids to the cathode is not much affected by gravity the adhesion strength between the deposits and the stainless steel surface is high enough to overcome the interference of gravity and or water flow however some precipitates were observed at the bottom of the reactor which may come from the cathode or formed initially in the liquid via homogenous calcium phosphate precipitation the wastewater ph increased from 4 5 to 5 8 this ph increase is caused by the fact that water is oxidized to protons and oxygen at the anode and chloride is oxidized to chlorine gas in this way the uncombined hydroxyl ions produced at the cathode by means of water reduction are not completely neutralized by the deficit protons produced at the anode from water oxidation based on theoretical calculation and experimental verification the homogeneous formation of calcium phosphate in the wastewater is indeed possible at such a ph such possibilities will be addressed in the following chapters 3 2 effects of operational conditions on the system s performance under continuous flow operation mode after confirming the feasibility of the tubular cathode design the influences of operating conditions including current hydraulic retention time hrt and phosphate concentration on the system s performance were studied fig 4 it should be noted that no maintenance was performed over the whole treatment period therefore the change of ions removal as a function of operational conditions in this continuous flow test results from multiple factors with the influence of initial deposits stand out on the one hand the covering of the cathode surface by initial deposits means less bare cathode precipitation area for subsequent precipitation that would negatively affect the system s performance on the other hand the initial deposits may facilitate the subsequent deposition as seed material which allows the direct growth of calcium phosphate on their surface the trade off between the positive and negative influences of initial deposits together with the impact caused by altering operational conditions explains the observed trend 3 2 1 influence of current as shown in fig 5 and table s2 the p removal efficiency increases significantly with increasing the applied current at the beginning of the continuous flow test the system achieved nearly 64 removal of p or 719 mg p day at 400 ma the removal performance was improved to around 75 or 805 mg p day by increasing the applied current to 600 ma in this case the p concentration in the effluent drops to about 200 mg l fig 4a in the third stage the current was reduced to 200 ma as expected an increase of p concentration in the effluent was observed stabilized at 520 mg l 40 or 463 mg p day in the fourth stage the current was increased to 800 ma which boosts the removal efficiency to 79 884 mg p day the removal trend is following the findings in previous batch studies where the removal of phosphorus increased with the current but reached a plateau after a certain point fig 5a in this case the turning point occurs around 600 ma there is no pronounced increase in the system s performance from 600 to 800 ma the removal trends of ca fig 5b and mg fig 5c as a function of current were similar to that of p however it is worth mentioning that the removal of ca and mg at 800 ma is slightly lower than that of 600 ma this is probably linked to the impact of initial deposits the test with 800 ma was performed in a later stage where most of the cathode surface had been occupied by accumulated precipitates this may affect the interaction of cathode produced hydroxide ions with bicarbonate and mg2 so as the formation of caco3 and mg precipitates which requires a higher ph than calcium phosphate lei et al 2021 notably the effluent ph is also heavily affected by the applied current fig 5d the effluent ph fluctuates between 4 9 and 6 5 and the higher the applied current the higher the effluent ph this is due to the competing chlorine gas formation at the anode and therefore a deficit of protons calcium phosphate precipitation is a ph dependent reaction thus the increased bulk ph may drive calcium phosphate formation and precipitation in the liquid instead of on the cathode a separate chemical precipitation test by adjusting the bulk ph of raw cheese wastewater from 4 5 to 6 0 with sodium hydroxide naoh was performed to explore the possible impact of increased bulk ph the results show that 67 of p was removed at ph 6 0 33 at ph 5 5 and less than 2 at ph 5 0 however regardless of the adjusted ph the removal of mg is not significant the results align with the previous calculation with medusa hydra lei et al 2021 the wastewater will become highly saturated regarding calcium phosphate species when the ph is above 5 5 however the wastewater ph needs to reach as high as 10 0 to form mg precipitates i e mg oh 2 while the control tests confirmed the potential of calcium phosphate formation in the bulk water at raised wastewater ph this does not guarantee that the ions will behave the same as in the ecapp system in classical nucleation theory with foreign objects presence heterogeneous nucleation occurs more readily than homogenous nucleation since the energy barrier for nucleation may be significantly reduced on a foreign object wang and nancollas 2008 in this case the initial deposits may assist the following nucleation and crystallization of calcium phosphate in a previous study lei et al 2021 collected the solids on the cathode and in the liquid at the bottom of the reactor separately it was found that the cathode solids account for 92 of the total removed p the bulk ph in the previous study was up to 8 0 which is higher than that of the continuous flow system due to the vertical placement of electrodes in the present study it is challenging to quantify and distinguish the solids formed directly in the liquid homogenous and the cathode heterogeneous however it was found that most of the solids accumulated on the cathode and only a small percentage of solids at the reactor s bottom after disconnecting the reactor thus it is concluded that homogenous precipitation does not contribute significantly to p removal in the ecapp system the specific energy consumption increased with the increase of current it went up from 27 0 kwh kg p at 200 ma to 65 2 kwh kg p at 800 ma table s2 suggesting that the enhanced phosphate removal cannot compensate for the increased electricity consumption the principle of ecapp lies in electrochemical mediated h2o reduction at the cathode which creates a cathodically high ph environment driving calcium phosphate precipitation in this process only part of the formed oh was consumed by a series of chemical reactions involved in calcium phosphate formation the other part diffused into the bulk solution increasing the bulk solutions ph to a large extent the specific energy consumption depends on the proportion of oh consumed by precipitation reactions in other words the larger the percentage of the oh diffused to bulk solution the more the current was wasted leading to higher specific energy consumption when a higher current was applied the oh consumption by precipitation reactions reaches a plateau due to the relatively low availability of lattice ions po4 3 and ca2 compared to overloaded oh and the limitation of mass diffusion consequently a larger percentage of uncombined oh diffused to the bulk solution as confirmed by the observed ph increase in this way a higher current density can lead to higher specific energy consumption in large scale applications both removal efficiency and energy consumption need to be considered while applying a low current density is an effective way to reduce the operation cost it may directly result in a higher p concentration in the effluent therefore the operational parameters should be optimized based on practical requirements to achieve high removal and energy efficiency in real applications 3 2 2 influence of hrt the effect of hrt on the removal trends of p ca and mg at 800 ma is depicted in fig 6 as expected the removal efficiencies of p ca and mg were all increased by the extended hrt specifically the p removal efficiency was 36 57 and 79 at hrt of 1 1 5 and 3 d respectively fig 6a the corresponding removal of ca was 31 51 and 72 fig 6b the removal of mg increased from 26 at 1 d to 41 at 1 5 d and further to 59 at 3 d hrt fig 6c with a higher hrt the same volume of cheese wastewater will have more time for electrochemical conversion in the system leaving more hydroxide ions and time for po4 3 and ca2 in cheese wastewater to diffuse and precipitate on the cathode it was also noticed that this increasing trend is not in proportion for example when the hrt was extended from 1 to 3 d the p removal efficiency was increased from 33 to 78 this can be explained by the drop in p and ca concentrations by extended hrt resulting in the poor availability of lattice ions and the corresponding low thermodynamic driving force for calcium phosphate precipitation lei et al 2018b the system achieved the highest p removal rate at 1 5 d hrt 1267 mg p day which is much higher than that of 3 d hrt 884 mg p day the corresponding specific energy consumption is 48 5 kwh kg p table s2 although this is higher than that of 3 d hrt at 200 ma 27 0 kwh kg p and 463 mg p day and 400 ma 34 7 kwh kg p and 719 mg p day these operational conditions are still attractive when taking the removal rate and removal efficiency into account apart from ions removal the effluent ph was increased from 4 8 to 6 5 in response to the rise of hrt fig 6d based on experimental verification and theoretical calculation it is impossible to achieve alleged phosphorus removal at ph 4 8 yet 36 p removal efficiency was realized in this system the precipitation of mg oh 2 is not thermodynamically favorable below ph 10 0 let alone to say at ph 6 5 however the system accomplished 26 4 to 58 6 mg removal fig 6c those results highlight the importance of local ph and again suggest that the main removal pathway lies in forming deposits at the cathode surface heterogeneous and not in the liquid homogeneous 3 2 3 influence of phosphate concentration in the seventh and the eighth stage we fed the reactor with demi water diluted cheese wastewater to understand how the initial phosphate concentration affects the system s performance overall the results are consistent with the expectation that the higher the dilution factors the higher the removal efficiency as shown in fig 7 with ten time dilution the p removal efficiency was around 64 which is 10 higher than that of two time dilution 54 and about two fold of that without dilution 36 calcium phosphate formation is a ph and concentration dependent process under the specific time of electrolysis while the cathode produced hydroxide ions are not affected by the dilution the molar ratio of produced hydroxide ion to phosphate is substantially enhanced another possible reason is that the buffer capacity of the wastewater decreased with the dilution thus a relatively higher local and bulk ph may be established facilitating calcium phosphate precipitation indeed with ten time dilution the effluent ph was increased from 5 3 to 7 9 whereas with two time dilution the effluent ph was increased from 4 7 to 6 0 however without dilution the effluent ph was only slightly increased from 4 5 to 4 8 the removal rate decreased from 1194 mg p day x1 to 875 mg p day x2 and further to 207 mg p day x10 as summarized in table s2 moreover the removed ca p molar ratio increased from 1 95 to 2 16 and further to 2 62 suggesting an increased formation of byproducts i e caco3 likely the specific energy consumption rose sharply from 51 5 kwh kg p x1 to 306 1 kwh kg p x10 following the previous report that the energy consumption of the ecapp system is significantly affected by the p concentration in the targeted wastewater lei et al 2019a therefore the dilution of cheese wastewater which is of practice by our industrial partner is not suggested the system will be more energy efficient in removing and recovering phosphorus from the raw undiluted wastewater 3 3 long term performance without maintenance the system s performance under long term continuous flow operation was further studied for more than 170 days fig 8 the results confirmed the high stability of this scalable system the cathode was not cleaned during the whole operational period this means the deposits on the cathode were not harvested although the cathode was covered by deposits after a couple of weeks of operation this system s performance was not affected it was found that new deposits were built on the initial deposits on the cathode no apparent steady decrease in removal efficiency was observed in the whole period by the time the power was turned off no signs of a drop in p removal efficiency are foreseen however some fluctuations in the last twenty days were noticed which is likely due to the inevitable reduced retention time caused by the fill in of solids in the reactor after 173 days of operation the reactor was almost filled with the deposits figure s2 at the end of the long term stability test the system was switched to open circuit mode 0 ma instead of a reduced p removal it was found that the p removal jumped up to 97 3 in the open circuit this is probably linked to the high ph in the effluent the effluent ph reached 12 2 such a high ph is sufficient to drive homogenous calcium phosphate precipitation the high effluent ph is explained by the delayed diffusion of cathode produced hydroxide ions by the deposits on the cathode the formed deposition layer serves as a porous wall retarded the diffusion of hydroxide ions to some extent however the diffusion of anode produced acid was not affected consequently there is an accumulation of oh in the deposition layer when the current is turned off while the anode reaction stops the accumulated hydroxide ions in the deposition layer cathode will be gradually released resulting in a jump of wastewater ph and an unexpected high p removal efficiency with time elapse the influence of accumulated hydroxide ions becomes weaker and weaker this phenomenon is similar to the retardation of oh by graphite felt lei et al 2020 it was found that the placement of a piece of graphite felt on the mesh pt ti cathode resulted in a lowered bulk ph compared to that in the absence of the graphite felt which is also due to the influence of graphite felt on the diffusion of cathode produced hydroxide ions with regard to the collection of solids it is possible to integrate a scraper i e a ring the deposited solids can be removed from the cathode by automatically pushing down the scraper along the inside direction of the tubular cathode alternatively polarity reversal can be applied the change of electrode polarity might be able to remove the solids from the cathode in this way the solids can be easily collected from the bottom of the reactor 3 4 characterization of recovered solids the recovered solids have a relatively high p content dominated by calcium phosphate as shown in table s3 the solids contain 9wt of p which is comparable and even higher than that found in incinerated sewage sludge and meets the fertilizer industry requirement cunha et al 2020 the primary polluting metals are fe al zn and cr but all below the regulation limits those coprecipitated heavy metals could be necessary micronutrients for crops and plants the ca p atomic ratio lies between 1 51 and 1 98 table s3 a ratio higher than 1 67 indicates the solids may contain some other calcium minerals like caco3 in addition to calcium phosphate indeed this was confirmed by xrd characterization for the solids collected from the cathode and the bottom of the 4 0 l reactor we found matched spectrums for both caco3 and hap figure s3 a with the latter being the dominant species the cathode collected solids contain 68wt hap and 32wt caco3 the bottom collected solids consist of 81 5wt hap and 18 5wt caco3 in light of the acidic cheese wastewater ph 4 5 and the very low inorganic carbon content below detection limit after necessary dilution it was speculated that the carbonate coprecipitated with ca2 originates from the anode or anode mediated mineralization of organics due to the formation of strongly oxidizing species like cl2 and ocl however this needs to be verified in future studies we only found matched hap pattern for the solids collected under long term operation in the 2 8 l reactor figure s3b this may be explained by decreased formation of caco3 as different operational conditions were applied and or by the re dissolution of caco3 solids which likely occurs given the low bulk ph 5 0 see fig 8 it is worth noting that the peaks assigned to hap are relatively broad indicating the low crystallinity of calcium phosphate and or the presence of amorphous phases 3 5 scenario calculation this technology could be used by an industrial wastewater treatment plant where cheese wastewater was mixed with general industrial waste and treated within the biological process therefore a robust calculation of capex and opex of using ecapp for treating cheese wastewater was provided based on a flow rate of 100 m3 per week or 14 m3 per day which is relevant for the wastewater treatment plant the detailed calculation is included in text s1 in the supporting information the calculation indicates the capex of building a 21 m3 reactor is 160 520 euros with pt coated ti anode being the most expensive investment opex is the electricity consumption for driving the electrochemical reactions and pumping costs this is calculated to be 18 1 euros day the yearly revenue which includes the value of recovered phosphorus 1 5 euro kg p and 30 cheese wastewater treatment is 20 857 euros the revenue after subtracting the opex is 39 0 euros day this means the investment cost can be recovered in about 11 3 years from the 12th year the net income is projected to be positive 4 conclusions the column shaped electrochemical reactor using tubular stainless steel cathode effectively removed phosphate from the acidic cheese wastewater with a bulk ph of 4 5 the tubular design did not affect the affinity of deposits towards the cathode the solids attached firmly to the cathode the cylindrical prototype allows for long term continuous flow operation with negligible maintenance over 173 days of operation no evident decrease in system performance was observed it is possible to recover almost pure p product from a complex waste stream the recovered solids have high reuse potential due to their high p content and low concentration of metals the porous deposition layer on the cathode delays the diffusion of cathode produced hydroxide ions

16972,phosphorus p is an irreplaceable element playing a vital role in living organisms yet has limited earth reserves the possibility of p recovery from wastewaters by electrochemically induced calcium phosphate precipitation ecapp was demonstrated previously the current study presents a novel scalable prototype consisting of a column shaped electrochemical reactor a tubular stainless steel cathode and a pt coated ti anode the adhesion of solids to the cathode important for product recovery was shown not to be negatively impacted by electrodes vertical placement the influence of current density hydraulic retention time hrt and initial phosphate concentration in this prototype were examined under continuous flow operation the system accomplished the highest p removal rate 1267 mg day at 1 5 d hrt and 800 ma in treating undiluted cheese wastewater with 48 5 kwh kg p moreover the prototype showed high stability and efficiency 50 over 173 days of continuous operation without performing maintenance after turning off the current 0 ma the system realized a surprising p removal jump up to 97 3 revealing the delayed diffusion of hydroxide ions by the deposition layer the calculation of capex and opex of ecapp in treating 100 m3 cheese wastewater per week indicates that the ecapp plant can realize net positive from the 12th year the recovered solids have relatively high p content 9wt and insignificant contamination of heavy metals overall the proven suitability of the scalable prototype can pave the way towards the actual adoption of the ecapp process graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords phosphate removal continuous flow operation energy consumption calcium phosphate ph cheese wastewater 1 introduction phosphorus p is an irreplaceable element for all living organisms for humans p is linked to gene expression i e rna and energy carrier i e atp and is one of the major elements in bones the only p source for plants is the soil which needs regular replenishment with artificial p fertilizer indeed our modern agriculture industry heavily depends on fertilization to maintain crop yield to feed the increasing global population cordell et al 2009 in this context phosphate rock mining is essential elser and bennett 2011 unfortunately phosphate rock is a finite resource and the runoff of p results in an environmental problem namely eutrophication schindler et al 2016 therefore the lost p in waste streams needs to be removed and recycled as a supplementary p source elser and bennett 2011 mayer et al 2016 the well established p removal processes include enhanced biological p removal adsorption chemical precipitation coagulation and fluidized bed crystallization desmidt et al 2015 le et al 2021 melia et al 2017 morse et al 1998 while each approach has its merits and drawbacks the principle is the same the transfer of dissolved p ions from liquid to a solid phase so it can be readily recovered in recent years electrochemical techniques ets attract increasing attention as the next generation facilities for decentralized wastewater treatment especially for rural areas and isolated communities brillas et al 2009 radjenovic and sedlak 2015 xu et al 2020 in the realm of phosphate removal and recovery advanced ets such as capacitive deionization bian et al 2020 huang et al 2014 electrodialysis paltrinieri et al 2019 zhang et al 2013 and electrochemically induced precipitation have been proposed lei 2019 among those ets electrochemically induced calcium phosphate precipitation ecapp has been shown effective in complicated waste streams such as domestic wastewater lei et al 2018a anaerobic digestion effluent takabe et al 2020 and cheese wastewater lei et al 2021 the unique advantage of the ecapp approach is that it does not require the addition of chemicals more importantly it can work at a broad range of ph including acidic solutions by creating a local high ph environment close to the cathode in contrast charge dependent electrochemical separation of phosphate i e capacitive deionization is highly sensitive to ph because ph determines phosphate speciation in bulk solutions bian et al 2020 moreover the products of the ecapp approach are relatively dense calcium phosphate containing solids compared to chemical sludge therefore the products can be easily collected while electrochemically mediated struvite formation is also possible kruk et al 2014 wang et al 2010 it suffers from the need of dosing mg2 as most waste streams deviate from a satisfied mg2 nh4 po4 3 stoichiometric ratio hovelmann and putnis 2016 by contrast calcium is an abundant ion in both natural and engineered water bodies additionally calcium phosphate is a preferred product for the fertilizer industry as it is similar in composition to phosphate rocks and fits with the existing p fertilizer production processes tervahauta et al 2014 on top of p fertilizers other value added products such as h3po4 can be made with the recovered calcium phosphate solids meesschaert et al 2020 previous studies explored the mechanism of ecapp and identified the importance of local ph with synthetic solutions lei et al 2017 the feasibility of ecapp for treating domestic wastewater was also evaluated from the perspective of removal efficiency energy efficiency and the quality of recovered solids the ecapp system achieved up to 90 recovery of p as calcium phosphate nonetheless the recovered solids have a low p content which is because of the low p concentration 10 mg l compared to bicarbonate 120 mg l in domestic wastewaters leading to the significant coprecipitation of caco3 lei et al 2018a moreover the low p concentration also results in high energy consumption lei et al 2019b hence it was suggested that the target application of ecapp should be acidic p rich waste streams such as effluents from phosphorus acid production factories and some food wastewaters lei et al 2021 recently investigated the possibility of ecapp in cheese wastewater characterized by high salinity high cod and an acidic environment ph 5 0 even in non optimized conditions the specific energy consumption was significantly reduced to 67 kwh kg p in treating cheese wastewater nonetheless several challenges need to be addressed before scaling up first from an engineering point of view the horizontal placement of electrodes with the cathode at the bottom and the anode at the top is not suitable for upscaling the reactor needs to be disconnected so that the solids on the cathode can be collected second the use of a noble metal coated electrode as the cathode needs to be replaced with cheap inert electrodes to make the process economically attractive third all previous studies were performed in batch mode there is a lack of evidence for the long term stability of ecapp in particular it remains unclear how the buildup of initial deposits on the cathode affects subsequent deposition will the removal efficiency be reduced after the cathode is covered by accumulated deposits to this end a novel column shaped electrochemical reactor was built the reactor consists of a tubular stainless steel cathode which is cheap and provides a large surface area for precipitation moreover it is possible to realize the automatic collection of deposits without disconnecting the reactor firstly the feasibility of this new configuration was explored secondly the influence of operational conditions was evaluated in the continuous flow mode in the end the long term performance and stability of this system which is of great importance towards upscaling were assessed overall this study moves one step further from the understanding of precipitation mechanism to the demonstration of the ecapp system in long term continuous flow operation at conditions relevant for potential upscaling for large volumes of wastewater 2 methods and materials 2 1 materials the real cheese wastewater was collected from a local industrial wastewater treatment plant groningen the netherlands and stored in a 4 c fridge the physicochemical characteristics table s1 were analyzed immediately after sampling all anodes were purchased from magneto special anodes b v the netherlands the stainless steel cathode was received for free from lascon b v heerenveen the netherlands 2 2 prototype design in this study two prototype reactors were constructed one with a working volume of 4 0 l and the other one with 2 8 l as shown in fig 1 a the 4 0 l prototype consists of a glass reactor a tubular shaped stainless steel cathode height 38 cm diameter 9 cm thickness 0 1 cm a ru ir coated titanium sheet anode 63 cm length 2 cm width and several inlets and outlets distributed at the top and bottom section of the glass reactor which allows wastewater in out and mixing the tubular cathode was placed vertically close to the reactor s inside wall while the anode was placed in the middle of the reactor for a uniform current distribution all tests were performed at room temperature 23 1 c under constant current mode by a direct current power supply est 150 delta electronics b v the cheese wastewater flows through the reactor in an up flow configuration with a feed pump masterflex the wastewater inside the reactor was mixed with a pump at a circulation rate of 200 ml min the 2 8 l prototype electrochemical cell was configured similarly fig 1b the possible effect of the meshed configuration on cathode was investigated in pre tests in which an insignificant impact was observed therefore a tubular cathode with a 35 4 open area was applied in this 2 8 l reactor from an economic point of view consistent with the 4 0 l reactor inert material pt coated titanium rod was selected as the anode moreover the 2 8 l reactor is a closed system which is not open to the air in this case the collection of cathode produced h2 and anode produced cl2 were considered at the top of the prototype there is an outlet connected to a bottle filled with 1 m naoh solution used for cl2 adsorption the actual image of the 2 8 l reactor is presented in figure s1a 2 3 feasibility and influence of operational conditions first the feasibility of the new cathode configuration with the 4 0 l electrochemical cell was investigated with a five days test in batch mode the influences of operational conditions including current 200 400 600 800 ma hrt 1 1 5 3 d and phosphate concentration x1 x2 x10 dilution factor were explored with the 4 0 l reactor under continuous flow operation mode on studying the influence of current a two week test with a fixed hrt of 3 d for each current was performed on studying the influence of hrt the system was run for one week under constant current 800 ma for each hrt on studying the influence of phosphate concentration the raw wastewater was diluted two or ten times with demi water table 1 summarizes the operational conditions at different stages liquid samples were taken from the feed and effluent tanks regularly it is worth noting that the system takes a couple of days to stabilize after altering the operational conditions during the test hence the prototype reactor s performance was evaluated based on samples taken at the stationary state in each testing period 2 4 long term stability the 2 8 l prototype reactor was used to study the system s performance under long term continuous flow operation the system was run at 600 ma and 3 d hrt based on the preliminary tests from day 1 to day 30 the prototype s performance was monitored over 173 days of operation fig 2 gives a schematic diagram of the process the cheese wastewater was pumped to the reactor at a flow rate of 0 93 l d from a feed tank refilled periodically with cheese wastewater that was stored in the fridge the wastewater inside the reactor was mixed with a circulation pump at a flow rate of 200 ml min liquid samples were taken from the influent and effluent regularly in which the ph concentrations of ca mg and p were analyzed it is worth mentioning that no maintenance was performed over 173 days of operation after 151 days of operation the system was switched to an open circuit 0 ma for two weeks 2 5 liquid analysis the ph and conductivity were monitored by a ph conductivity meter seven excellence s470 mettler toledo the concentrations of p ca k and mg were quantified by icp aes optima 5300 dv perkin elmer the concentrations of anions po4 3 cl and so4 2 and na were measured by ion chromatography compact ic 761 metrohm equipped with a metrosep a supp 4 5 guard precolumn a metrohm metrosep a 122 supp 5 150 4 0 mm column and a conductivity detector all liquid samples for icp aes and ic analysis were filtrated by 0 45 μm membrane filters after proper dilution cod total nitrogen and ammonium in cheese wastewater were determined using cuvette lck 114 150 1000 mg l lck 138 1 16 mg l and lck 304 0 02 2 50 mg l respectively following the standard procedures proposed by hach germany 2 6 solids characterization in both reactors the bottom collected solids were obtained from the bottom of the reactor regularly the collected solids were first washed with demi water and then dried in the oven at 105 c for 24 h the solids were characterized with xrd for determining their phase and crystallinity the quantification of the elemental composition of the solids was realized by combining acid digestion and icp aes analysis briefly 0 1 g solids were dissolved in 5 ml hno3 69 and then appropriately diluted for elemental analysis with icp aes 2 7 calculations the removal efficiency of the ions was calculated with equation 1 1 remo val effi cien cy 100 c inf c eff c inf where cinf and ceff are the ions concentration in the influent and effluent respectively the energy consumption in the electrochemical system was calculated as equation 2 2 w k w h u i t where u is the recorded cell voltage v i is the set current a t is the electrolysis time h the specific energy consumption is defined by the consumed electricity kwh and recovered phosphorus kg under a particular time frame 2 8 scenario calculation the opex and capex of treating 100 m3per week cheese wastewater using ecapp technology were calculated 3 results and discussion 3 1 feasibility of tubular configuration previously the cathode was placed horizontally against the anode figure s1b this type of electrode configuration allows the direct deposition of solids on the cathode partially due to gravity however this type of design is not suitable for large scale applications in collecting deposits in practice a tubular structure is ideal for continuous flow operation and to maximize the ratio between the cathode surface area and the cell volume m2 m3 while this may benefit the cleaning of electrodes it is unclear how this affects the behavior of precipitated solids because of gravity and water flow the precipitates may detach automatically from the cathode in light of the low cheese wastewater ph the detached solids may dissolve to explore this we performed a single batch test with this new design and compared the results with a previously studied horizontal electrode configuration it was found that fortunately the solids did not detach from the cathode automatically fig 3 shows the removal of phosphate is highly efficient in this new design compared to the previous design the new reactor achieves comparable phosphate removal efficiency 94 3 vs 93 3 while treating more wastewater 4 0 l vs 0 9 l in an equal time interval and equal current the removal of ca and mg was also comparable to the previous system after 96 h treatment 89 4 of ca and 82 7 of mg were removed overall the results show that the attachment of solids to the cathode is not much affected by gravity the adhesion strength between the deposits and the stainless steel surface is high enough to overcome the interference of gravity and or water flow however some precipitates were observed at the bottom of the reactor which may come from the cathode or formed initially in the liquid via homogenous calcium phosphate precipitation the wastewater ph increased from 4 5 to 5 8 this ph increase is caused by the fact that water is oxidized to protons and oxygen at the anode and chloride is oxidized to chlorine gas in this way the uncombined hydroxyl ions produced at the cathode by means of water reduction are not completely neutralized by the deficit protons produced at the anode from water oxidation based on theoretical calculation and experimental verification the homogeneous formation of calcium phosphate in the wastewater is indeed possible at such a ph such possibilities will be addressed in the following chapters 3 2 effects of operational conditions on the system s performance under continuous flow operation mode after confirming the feasibility of the tubular cathode design the influences of operating conditions including current hydraulic retention time hrt and phosphate concentration on the system s performance were studied fig 4 it should be noted that no maintenance was performed over the whole treatment period therefore the change of ions removal as a function of operational conditions in this continuous flow test results from multiple factors with the influence of initial deposits stand out on the one hand the covering of the cathode surface by initial deposits means less bare cathode precipitation area for subsequent precipitation that would negatively affect the system s performance on the other hand the initial deposits may facilitate the subsequent deposition as seed material which allows the direct growth of calcium phosphate on their surface the trade off between the positive and negative influences of initial deposits together with the impact caused by altering operational conditions explains the observed trend 3 2 1 influence of current as shown in fig 5 and table s2 the p removal efficiency increases significantly with increasing the applied current at the beginning of the continuous flow test the system achieved nearly 64 removal of p or 719 mg p day at 400 ma the removal performance was improved to around 75 or 805 mg p day by increasing the applied current to 600 ma in this case the p concentration in the effluent drops to about 200 mg l fig 4a in the third stage the current was reduced to 200 ma as expected an increase of p concentration in the effluent was observed stabilized at 520 mg l 40 or 463 mg p day in the fourth stage the current was increased to 800 ma which boosts the removal efficiency to 79 884 mg p day the removal trend is following the findings in previous batch studies where the removal of phosphorus increased with the current but reached a plateau after a certain point fig 5a in this case the turning point occurs around 600 ma there is no pronounced increase in the system s performance from 600 to 800 ma the removal trends of ca fig 5b and mg fig 5c as a function of current were similar to that of p however it is worth mentioning that the removal of ca and mg at 800 ma is slightly lower than that of 600 ma this is probably linked to the impact of initial deposits the test with 800 ma was performed in a later stage where most of the cathode surface had been occupied by accumulated precipitates this may affect the interaction of cathode produced hydroxide ions with bicarbonate and mg2 so as the formation of caco3 and mg precipitates which requires a higher ph than calcium phosphate lei et al 2021 notably the effluent ph is also heavily affected by the applied current fig 5d the effluent ph fluctuates between 4 9 and 6 5 and the higher the applied current the higher the effluent ph this is due to the competing chlorine gas formation at the anode and therefore a deficit of protons calcium phosphate precipitation is a ph dependent reaction thus the increased bulk ph may drive calcium phosphate formation and precipitation in the liquid instead of on the cathode a separate chemical precipitation test by adjusting the bulk ph of raw cheese wastewater from 4 5 to 6 0 with sodium hydroxide naoh was performed to explore the possible impact of increased bulk ph the results show that 67 of p was removed at ph 6 0 33 at ph 5 5 and less than 2 at ph 5 0 however regardless of the adjusted ph the removal of mg is not significant the results align with the previous calculation with medusa hydra lei et al 2021 the wastewater will become highly saturated regarding calcium phosphate species when the ph is above 5 5 however the wastewater ph needs to reach as high as 10 0 to form mg precipitates i e mg oh 2 while the control tests confirmed the potential of calcium phosphate formation in the bulk water at raised wastewater ph this does not guarantee that the ions will behave the same as in the ecapp system in classical nucleation theory with foreign objects presence heterogeneous nucleation occurs more readily than homogenous nucleation since the energy barrier for nucleation may be significantly reduced on a foreign object wang and nancollas 2008 in this case the initial deposits may assist the following nucleation and crystallization of calcium phosphate in a previous study lei et al 2021 collected the solids on the cathode and in the liquid at the bottom of the reactor separately it was found that the cathode solids account for 92 of the total removed p the bulk ph in the previous study was up to 8 0 which is higher than that of the continuous flow system due to the vertical placement of electrodes in the present study it is challenging to quantify and distinguish the solids formed directly in the liquid homogenous and the cathode heterogeneous however it was found that most of the solids accumulated on the cathode and only a small percentage of solids at the reactor s bottom after disconnecting the reactor thus it is concluded that homogenous precipitation does not contribute significantly to p removal in the ecapp system the specific energy consumption increased with the increase of current it went up from 27 0 kwh kg p at 200 ma to 65 2 kwh kg p at 800 ma table s2 suggesting that the enhanced phosphate removal cannot compensate for the increased electricity consumption the principle of ecapp lies in electrochemical mediated h2o reduction at the cathode which creates a cathodically high ph environment driving calcium phosphate precipitation in this process only part of the formed oh was consumed by a series of chemical reactions involved in calcium phosphate formation the other part diffused into the bulk solution increasing the bulk solutions ph to a large extent the specific energy consumption depends on the proportion of oh consumed by precipitation reactions in other words the larger the percentage of the oh diffused to bulk solution the more the current was wasted leading to higher specific energy consumption when a higher current was applied the oh consumption by precipitation reactions reaches a plateau due to the relatively low availability of lattice ions po4 3 and ca2 compared to overloaded oh and the limitation of mass diffusion consequently a larger percentage of uncombined oh diffused to the bulk solution as confirmed by the observed ph increase in this way a higher current density can lead to higher specific energy consumption in large scale applications both removal efficiency and energy consumption need to be considered while applying a low current density is an effective way to reduce the operation cost it may directly result in a higher p concentration in the effluent therefore the operational parameters should be optimized based on practical requirements to achieve high removal and energy efficiency in real applications 3 2 2 influence of hrt the effect of hrt on the removal trends of p ca and mg at 800 ma is depicted in fig 6 as expected the removal efficiencies of p ca and mg were all increased by the extended hrt specifically the p removal efficiency was 36 57 and 79 at hrt of 1 1 5 and 3 d respectively fig 6a the corresponding removal of ca was 31 51 and 72 fig 6b the removal of mg increased from 26 at 1 d to 41 at 1 5 d and further to 59 at 3 d hrt fig 6c with a higher hrt the same volume of cheese wastewater will have more time for electrochemical conversion in the system leaving more hydroxide ions and time for po4 3 and ca2 in cheese wastewater to diffuse and precipitate on the cathode it was also noticed that this increasing trend is not in proportion for example when the hrt was extended from 1 to 3 d the p removal efficiency was increased from 33 to 78 this can be explained by the drop in p and ca concentrations by extended hrt resulting in the poor availability of lattice ions and the corresponding low thermodynamic driving force for calcium phosphate precipitation lei et al 2018b the system achieved the highest p removal rate at 1 5 d hrt 1267 mg p day which is much higher than that of 3 d hrt 884 mg p day the corresponding specific energy consumption is 48 5 kwh kg p table s2 although this is higher than that of 3 d hrt at 200 ma 27 0 kwh kg p and 463 mg p day and 400 ma 34 7 kwh kg p and 719 mg p day these operational conditions are still attractive when taking the removal rate and removal efficiency into account apart from ions removal the effluent ph was increased from 4 8 to 6 5 in response to the rise of hrt fig 6d based on experimental verification and theoretical calculation it is impossible to achieve alleged phosphorus removal at ph 4 8 yet 36 p removal efficiency was realized in this system the precipitation of mg oh 2 is not thermodynamically favorable below ph 10 0 let alone to say at ph 6 5 however the system accomplished 26 4 to 58 6 mg removal fig 6c those results highlight the importance of local ph and again suggest that the main removal pathway lies in forming deposits at the cathode surface heterogeneous and not in the liquid homogeneous 3 2 3 influence of phosphate concentration in the seventh and the eighth stage we fed the reactor with demi water diluted cheese wastewater to understand how the initial phosphate concentration affects the system s performance overall the results are consistent with the expectation that the higher the dilution factors the higher the removal efficiency as shown in fig 7 with ten time dilution the p removal efficiency was around 64 which is 10 higher than that of two time dilution 54 and about two fold of that without dilution 36 calcium phosphate formation is a ph and concentration dependent process under the specific time of electrolysis while the cathode produced hydroxide ions are not affected by the dilution the molar ratio of produced hydroxide ion to phosphate is substantially enhanced another possible reason is that the buffer capacity of the wastewater decreased with the dilution thus a relatively higher local and bulk ph may be established facilitating calcium phosphate precipitation indeed with ten time dilution the effluent ph was increased from 5 3 to 7 9 whereas with two time dilution the effluent ph was increased from 4 7 to 6 0 however without dilution the effluent ph was only slightly increased from 4 5 to 4 8 the removal rate decreased from 1194 mg p day x1 to 875 mg p day x2 and further to 207 mg p day x10 as summarized in table s2 moreover the removed ca p molar ratio increased from 1 95 to 2 16 and further to 2 62 suggesting an increased formation of byproducts i e caco3 likely the specific energy consumption rose sharply from 51 5 kwh kg p x1 to 306 1 kwh kg p x10 following the previous report that the energy consumption of the ecapp system is significantly affected by the p concentration in the targeted wastewater lei et al 2019a therefore the dilution of cheese wastewater which is of practice by our industrial partner is not suggested the system will be more energy efficient in removing and recovering phosphorus from the raw undiluted wastewater 3 3 long term performance without maintenance the system s performance under long term continuous flow operation was further studied for more than 170 days fig 8 the results confirmed the high stability of this scalable system the cathode was not cleaned during the whole operational period this means the deposits on the cathode were not harvested although the cathode was covered by deposits after a couple of weeks of operation this system s performance was not affected it was found that new deposits were built on the initial deposits on the cathode no apparent steady decrease in removal efficiency was observed in the whole period by the time the power was turned off no signs of a drop in p removal efficiency are foreseen however some fluctuations in the last twenty days were noticed which is likely due to the inevitable reduced retention time caused by the fill in of solids in the reactor after 173 days of operation the reactor was almost filled with the deposits figure s2 at the end of the long term stability test the system was switched to open circuit mode 0 ma instead of a reduced p removal it was found that the p removal jumped up to 97 3 in the open circuit this is probably linked to the high ph in the effluent the effluent ph reached 12 2 such a high ph is sufficient to drive homogenous calcium phosphate precipitation the high effluent ph is explained by the delayed diffusion of cathode produced hydroxide ions by the deposits on the cathode the formed deposition layer serves as a porous wall retarded the diffusion of hydroxide ions to some extent however the diffusion of anode produced acid was not affected consequently there is an accumulation of oh in the deposition layer when the current is turned off while the anode reaction stops the accumulated hydroxide ions in the deposition layer cathode will be gradually released resulting in a jump of wastewater ph and an unexpected high p removal efficiency with time elapse the influence of accumulated hydroxide ions becomes weaker and weaker this phenomenon is similar to the retardation of oh by graphite felt lei et al 2020 it was found that the placement of a piece of graphite felt on the mesh pt ti cathode resulted in a lowered bulk ph compared to that in the absence of the graphite felt which is also due to the influence of graphite felt on the diffusion of cathode produced hydroxide ions with regard to the collection of solids it is possible to integrate a scraper i e a ring the deposited solids can be removed from the cathode by automatically pushing down the scraper along the inside direction of the tubular cathode alternatively polarity reversal can be applied the change of electrode polarity might be able to remove the solids from the cathode in this way the solids can be easily collected from the bottom of the reactor 3 4 characterization of recovered solids the recovered solids have a relatively high p content dominated by calcium phosphate as shown in table s3 the solids contain 9wt of p which is comparable and even higher than that found in incinerated sewage sludge and meets the fertilizer industry requirement cunha et al 2020 the primary polluting metals are fe al zn and cr but all below the regulation limits those coprecipitated heavy metals could be necessary micronutrients for crops and plants the ca p atomic ratio lies between 1 51 and 1 98 table s3 a ratio higher than 1 67 indicates the solids may contain some other calcium minerals like caco3 in addition to calcium phosphate indeed this was confirmed by xrd characterization for the solids collected from the cathode and the bottom of the 4 0 l reactor we found matched spectrums for both caco3 and hap figure s3 a with the latter being the dominant species the cathode collected solids contain 68wt hap and 32wt caco3 the bottom collected solids consist of 81 5wt hap and 18 5wt caco3 in light of the acidic cheese wastewater ph 4 5 and the very low inorganic carbon content below detection limit after necessary dilution it was speculated that the carbonate coprecipitated with ca2 originates from the anode or anode mediated mineralization of organics due to the formation of strongly oxidizing species like cl2 and ocl however this needs to be verified in future studies we only found matched hap pattern for the solids collected under long term operation in the 2 8 l reactor figure s3b this may be explained by decreased formation of caco3 as different operational conditions were applied and or by the re dissolution of caco3 solids which likely occurs given the low bulk ph 5 0 see fig 8 it is worth noting that the peaks assigned to hap are relatively broad indicating the low crystallinity of calcium phosphate and or the presence of amorphous phases 3 5 scenario calculation this technology could be used by an industrial wastewater treatment plant where cheese wastewater was mixed with general industrial waste and treated within the biological process therefore a robust calculation of capex and opex of using ecapp for treating cheese wastewater was provided based on a flow rate of 100 m3 per week or 14 m3 per day which is relevant for the wastewater treatment plant the detailed calculation is included in text s1 in the supporting information the calculation indicates the capex of building a 21 m3 reactor is 160 520 euros with pt coated ti anode being the most expensive investment opex is the electricity consumption for driving the electrochemical reactions and pumping costs this is calculated to be 18 1 euros day the yearly revenue which includes the value of recovered phosphorus 1 5 euro kg p and 30 cheese wastewater treatment is 20 857 euros the revenue after subtracting the opex is 39 0 euros day this means the investment cost can be recovered in about 11 3 years from the 12th year the net income is projected to be positive 4 conclusions the column shaped electrochemical reactor using tubular stainless steel cathode effectively removed phosphate from the acidic cheese wastewater with a bulk ph of 4 5 the tubular design did not affect the affinity of deposits towards the cathode the solids attached firmly to the cathode the cylindrical prototype allows for long term continuous flow operation with negligible maintenance over 173 days of operation no evident decrease in system performance was observed it is possible to recover almost pure p product from a complex waste stream the recovered solids have high reuse potential due to their high p content and low concentration of metals the porous deposition layer on the cathode delays the diffusion of cathode produced hydroxide ions

toxicity by either generating active compounds and or by facilitating their release uv light even leads to the release of bioactive compounds from plastics of low chemical complexity to prevent the

2018 and commercially available plastic products li et al 2016 lithner et al 2009 oliviero et al 2019 for a variety of aquatic organisms adverse effects were generally attributed to leached chemicals

from uv weathered plastic materials bejgarn et al 2015 especially with in vitro bioassays coffin et al 2018 rummel et al 2019 yang et al 2011 as a consequence potential environmental hazards from uv induced plastic degradation products have been studied to a lesser degree gewert et al 2018 the present study focused on these aspects by examining in vitro toxicities of plastic leachates following artificial weathering scenarios therefore we selected a diverse range of plastics including seven petroleum based plastics three recyclates as well as two biodegradable and fully or partly bio based materials the plastics were chosen dependent on their high production volume increasing recycling rates plasticseurope 2019 and social perception as clean alternatives because property modifying chemicals are added to plastics derived from renewable feedstocks lambert wagner 2017 and to reused plastics bodar et al 2018 pivnenko et al 2016 schyns shaver 2020 examinations on adverse effects of such materials are just as important as for conventional plastics the main objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of uv on the leaching behavior of chemicals as integral components of plastic material and the related toxicological impact we simulated weathering by either atmospheric uv irradiation with a subsequent leaching period or directly under aquatic conditions leached

pvc as petroleum based plastics pet ldpe and pvc were also tested as recyclates r and bio based polybutylene succinate bio pbs and a starch blend sb as biodegradable plastics the sb contains polybutylene adipate terephthalate pbat thermoplastic starch glycerin and polylactic acid pla and thus represents a petroleum and bio based material table 1 each plastic category comprised two materials table 1 which were obtained from project partners as pellets 5 mm except for two pvc products fig s1 the pvc samples transparent plate and sheet pile were cut to pellet like pieces and thereby increased in surface area to achieve similar leaching conditions to record the leachable surface area 100 pellets of every plastic sample were measured on each dimension 0 001 mm using a stereo microscope olympus sz40 and extrapolated to the tested mass table s1 2 2 artificial weathering 100 g of each plastic were evenly distributed in 2 l duran crystallizing dishes 190 mm in diameter all glass products were rinsed prior to use with acetone and annealed at 200 c for at least 3 h test vessels were placed in a chamber with ventilation holes constructed with two uv lamps attached on each level fig s2 table s2 under laboratory conditions the test materials were irradiated for 24 h by either uv c at 250 nm treatment 2 t2 worst case scenario at 45 2 c as ambient temperature or uv a

simulated 8 16 h of european sun exposure table s4 in supporting information si and thus displayed mild exposure conditions compared to gewert et al 2018 leachates were then separated from test materials via büchner funnels into erlenmeyer flasks of which 100 ml were taken and measured ph and conductivity with a portable multimeter hq40d hach lange gmbh düsseldorf germany table s6 2 3 solid

retain hydrophobic compounds abbas et al 2019 before sample loading columns were conditioned with 2 ml heptane 2 ml acetone 6 ml methanol pro analysis and 8 ml ultrapure water a spe blank was prepared with 1 l ultrapure water columns were dried under a stream of nitrogen and eluted with 5 ml acetone and 5 ml methanol of which 200 µl were stored at 20 c for chemical analysis the remaining eluates contained 89 1 g of plastic equivalents eqs 200 µl of dimethyl sulfoxide dmso was added to the plastic eluates and concentrated under a stream of nitrogen to 200 µl as final extract volume these 5000 fold concentrated extracts were stored at 20 c prior to testing 2 4 in vitro bioassays 2 4 1 microtox assay the microtox assay with the bioluminescent bacterium aliivibrio fischeri assessed the baseline toxicity iso 11348 3 2007 the assay was performed according to völker et al 2017 with minor modifications control samples negative and solvent controls spe blank procedural blanks a reference compound 3 5 dichlorophenol table s7 fig s3a and plastic extracts were tested in duplicates reaching 1 v v as solvent concentration per well considering a 0 30 to 37 5 fold enrichment the tested plastic extracts are equivalent to 5 22 668 mg plastic for a better understanding the results were expressed in plastic eqs where 1 mg of plastic eqs corresponds to all leachables from 1 mg of plastic pellets in total three to four independent experiments were conducted 2 4 2 arec32 assay the arec32 assay with the human breast cancer cell line mcf7 assessed the oxidative stress response i e the cellular detoxification mechanism wang et al 2006 the cell line obtained from signosis inc santa clara ca usa included the nrf2 are signaling pathway coupled to a luciferase reporter gene following the procedure described by völker et al 2017 the assay was conducted with minor modifications control samples comp 2 4 1 reference compound tert butylhydroquinone table s7 fig s3b and plastic extracts were examined in duplicates per independent experiment three to five in total not exceeding a final solvent concentration of 0 5 v v the plastic samples corresponded to 1 74 222 mg plastic eqs which resulted in 0 10 to 12 5 fold concentrated extracts 2 4 3 yeast based reporter gene assays yeast based reporter gene lacz encoding for β galactosidase assays were conducted to assess the endocrine activity as preliminary screens revealed few estrogenic and androgenic findings but resulted in high antagonistic activities we examined the antagonistic activity at the human estrogen receptor α herα routledge sumpter 1996 and human androgen receptor har sohoni sumpter 1998 respectively therefore the yeast anti estrogen screen yaes and yeast anti androgen screen yaas were conducted as in abbas et al 2019 with minor modifications cell densities were adjusted to 250 25 yaes and 500 50 yaas of formazine attenuation units assays were performed in 96 well plates with eight technical replicates for each sample controls comp 2 4 1 reference compounds 4 hydroxytamoxifen yaes and flutamide yaas table s7 fig s3c d not exceeding 0 2 v v as solvent concentration the plastic samples contained 111 mg plastic eqs this means that 6 2 fold concentrated extracts were tested to detect antagonistic activities 17β estradiol yaes and testosterone yaas were added as agonists to the medium hence antagonistic compounds such as antiestrogens or antiandrogens inhibit the corresponding agonist from receptor activation and reduce the reporter gene activity in total three to five independent experiments were conducted 2 5 data analysis to derive concentration response curves and effect concentrations ecs nonlinear regressions were performed using a four parameter logistic function graphpad prism 5 and 8 graphpad software inc san diego ca usa cytotoxic samples were generally excluded from analysis and independent experiments were only considered for analysis when the half maximal response ec50 was next to the listed concentrations in table s7 for the microtox assay the luminescence inhibition of procedural blanks was subtracted from the respective samples ec20 values were derived for samples exceeding the 20 inhibition threshold and describe the plastic eq inducing this inhibition therefore the minimum and maximum effect was constrained to 0 and 100 inhibition respectively for the arec32 assay solvent controls and procedural blanks were pooled due to no significant differences kruskal wallis test followed by dunn s multiple comparison test α 0 05 the minimum effect was constrained to an induction ratio ir of 1 and derived ecir1 5 values refer to the plastic eq inducing a 1 5 fold elevated signaling pathway for yeast screens antagonistic activities were normalized to a minimum and maximum effect represented by a control with agonist 0 receptor inhibition and without agonist 100 receptor inhibition negative and solvent controls as well as procedural blanks were pooled as described before and used to derive the limit of detection lod activities above the lod calculated with pooled controls plus three times the standard deviation were considered significant to identify toxicity patterns data were normalized as relative activities and compared in a heat map therefore the highest ec value from either the microtox or arec32 assay corresponded to an activity of 0 while 100 was set to 0 0001 mg plastic eqs 2 6 chemical analysis the spe eluates section 2 3 were measured via hplc ms ms as described previously in detail nürenberg et al 2015 analysis was performed using a tripletof 6600 sciex coupled via an esi source to a binary hplc instrument 1260 infinity agilent equipped with a reversed phase c18 column zorbax eclipse plus 2 1 mm x 150 mm 3 5 µm agilent as eluent a water acetonitril gradient was used buffered with 0 1vol formic acid at a flow of 300 µl min 1 the method used both esi and esi ionization mode scan mode 100 1200 da samples were diluted 1 1 with ultrapure water and injected at 50 µl the data analysis was processed according a non target approach as described by jewell et al 2020 and köppe et al 2020 after data acquisition peak picking componentization alignment of the components and blank correction the components and their intensity were summed for each sample and ionization mode the data are summarized in table s9 the total count and intensity of all detected components were normalized according to the highest and lowest values and displayed in the heat map the intensity is used as an indicator for the approximate amount of chemicals in one sample derived from the most intense feature of the component 3 results 3 1 microtox assay the spe blank induced negligible luminescence inhibitions with 4 40 1 55 table s8 solvent controls did not inhibit the luminescence resulting in non derivable ec20 values not listed in table s8 procedural blanks as background contaminations were subtracted from the respective samples table s8 seven out of the 12 plastics induced baseline toxicity fig 1 pvc pvc a pvc r and ps samples ps gp ps hi as well as the bio pbs sb and the ldpe r resulted in low ec20 values high effect fig 1 fig 5 efficacies ranged from the lowest effect with 341 90 1 mg t2 ps gp to the highest effect with 7 32 3 59 mg t2 ldpe r fig 1 table s8 the ldpe r induced the highest observed effect in the microtox assay both biodegradable plastics and the ldpe r were the most potent plastics for every weathering treatment fig s4 the toxicities generally depended on the applied weathering condition for instance uv c provoked elevated toxicities for ps samples whereas no effect was observed in the dark control fig 1 fig 5 no observed effects correspond to 750 mg plastic eqs and were also found for pp h pp c pet a pet r and ldpe fig 1 fig 5 the toxicity order for treatments was the following in the microtox assay uv c uv a b and uv a baq dc fig s5 moreover we observed that this assay had one of the highest relative positive findings fig s5 3 2 arec32 assay few samples did not activate the nrf2 are signaling pathway which corresponds to 250 mg plastic eqs the spe blank not displayed in fig 2 induced the oxidative stress response with 206 20 6 mg table s8 similar minor inductions can be observed for pooled background contaminations and solvent controls abbreviated c from 229 13 6 t1 to 196 19 3 mg t3 fig 2 compared to the microtox assay the response is more differentiated in the human cell line fig 2 fig 5 every plastic material but not every tested weathering scenario induced a 1 5 fold elevated response for instance specific weathering types induced no effects for six out of 12 plastics e g for t3 and t4 pet a or t1 and t3 ps hi the most potent samples were ldpe r t1 14 7 2 11 mg and sb lowest ecir1 5 in t2 35 2 4 90 mg followed by pvc a t4 49 6 8 72 mg fig 5 table s8 as in the microtox assay fig s4 ldpe r and sb again induced the highest observed effects overall the weathering toxicity resulted in the following order for the arec32 assay uv c uv a baq uv a b dc this assay had the highest rate of positive findings fig s5 3 3 yeast based reporter gene assays in the yeast anti estrogen screen the spe blank inhibited the human estrogen receptor herα by 7 41 1 41 not displayed in fig 3 see table s8 pooled controls had minor effects with 1 56 0 74 inhibition t2 c fig 3 table s8 samples 20 2 lod of antiestrogenicity were considered as significant fig 3 every plastic material inhibited the receptor and thus leached antiestrogenic compounds fig 3 table s8 significantly increased activities were observed for seven out of the 12 plastics i e ldpe r pvc a sb bio pbs pvc r ps hi and ps gp for either every weathering scenario ldpe r and bio bps or only specific treatments the strongest antiestrogenic activity was observed for t3 ldpe r with 75 4 1 97 fig 3 table s8 comparable inhibitions were achieved with the pvc a t2 62 0 1 85 and pvc r sample t2 54 2 2 23 fig 3 table s8 in general uv c irradiation t2 led to pronounced effects for eight out of 12 plastics fig 5 resulting in the following weathering toxicity order in the yaes uv c uv a b uv a baq and dc fig s5 the yaes resulted in a lower positive finding rate than the microtox and arec32 assay regarding the yeast anti androgen screen we observed inhibitions of the human androgen receptor har for the spe blank with 13 0 2 52 not displayed in fig 4 see table s8 here activities 31 3 lod were considered significant pooled background contaminations and solvent controls c had their highest impact for t3 2 91 1 64 fig 4 table s8 all plastic samples inhibited the har fig 4 but activities depended on the applied weathering scenario the following samples led to a significant increase in antiandrogenic activity ldpe r sb bio pbs pvc a ps hi and ps gp fig 4 table s8 hence six out of 12 plastics resulted in significant antiandrogenicity compared to the yaes fig 3 we observed lower activities for pvc samples fig 4 high activities were again detected for ldpe r and sb fig 5 here uv a b irradiation during leaching t4 revealed to be the most affecting treatment with 96 2 0 44 for ldpe r and 86 3 0 11 for sb fig 5 table s8 in contrast to the yaes fig 3 only four plastics revealed pronounced antiandrogenic activities after uv c irradiation fig 5 the toxicity order for the treatments in the yaas is as follows uv c and uv a baq uv a b dc fig s5 finally we observed the lowest rate of positive findings in the yaas fig s5 3 4 chemical analysis the results of the screening via lc qtof can be used to get an overview about the chemical complexity of the leachates and for a rough estimation of the released amounts due to high differences in detector response for different molecules in lc ms analysis a comparison of particular plastic samples is very limited however the data revealed obvious differences in leaching from the particular plastic samples and uv induced changes fig 5 illustrates the component counts and intensities of the plastic eluates after subtraction of the procedural blanks when combining the positively and negatively ionized components we detected between 42 t1 pp h and 2896 t4 ldpe r compounds table s9 ldpe r both biodegradable plastics and pvc samples contained the highest counts pet ps pp samples and the ldpe released fewer components e g 855 for t2 pet r and 410 for t2 ps hi in general we detected a higher count for positively ionized than for negatively ionized components except for the bio pbs and ldpe table s9 moreover ldpe r bio pbs and sb showed the highest intensities fig 5 table s9 a clear influence by uv irradiation could not be observed for these plastics however other plastics such as pvc a and the pet a and pet r showed a strong increase in intensities after artificial weathering table s9 4 discussion 4 1 toxicity of plastics not subject of irradiation in the dark control t1 we identified toxicological activities for five out of 12 plastics i e the ldpe r sb bio pbs pvc a and pvc r fig 5 this highlights that uv light as an initiator of degradation is not an essential prerequisite for plastics to release toxic chemicals one of the most striking finding is the high toxicity resulting from sb and bio pbs indicating that biodegradable plastics emit active chemicals as well however this does not comply with the expectation that degradation products of biodegradable plastics should not exhibit any ecotoxicity lambert wagner 2017 in this study the sb sample induced in vitro activities comparable to the most potent non biodegradable sample ldpe r and thus was one of the most toxic samples both the bio pbs and sb are either fully bio pbs or only partly sb derived from renewable feedstock and are both biodegradable since such plastics are usually deployed as foils in agriculture they are usually examined in terms of seed germination thus cell culture studies are rare souza et al 2020 moreover bio associated plastics i e bio based and or biodegradable often comprise blends of several materials making a toxicological evaluation difficult the sb sample for instance represents a blend of polybutylene adipate terephthalate pbat thermoplastic starch glycerin and polylactic acid pla the latter can be used as a contact material e g for foodstuff farah et al 2016 and has been investigated more often than other bio associated plastics for instance zimmermann et al 2019 and yang et al 2011 used harsh extraction methods and linked pla products to baseline toxicity and estrogenicity respectively corn starch based foils were found to stimulate the bioluminescence of aliivibrio fischeri although the significant stimulant level was not exceeded sforzini et al 2016 furthermore souza et al 2020 observed decreased cellular viability for hepg2 c3a cells when exposed to pbat extracts our bio pbs sample induced high baseline toxicity as well as medium antiestrogenic and antiandrogenic responses fig 5 in contrast to specific compounds binding to nuclear receptors e g endocrine disruptors the bacterial and human cell assays are both sensitive to many stressors the oxidative stress response however can be induced selectively as well escher et al 2014 therefore it is not surprising that our bio pbs mostly affected one unspecific endpoint plastics active in the microtox assay did not necessarily translate to effects in the arec32 assay and vice versa fig 5 moreover toso et al 2017 assessed pbs foils with cultured t lymphocytes as non toxic zimmermann et al 2020 recently surveyed a broad range of bio associated plastics and assigned high baseline toxicity as well as antiandrogenicity to materials based on starch while extracts of pla pbs and pbat resulted in varied toxicities overall these results suggest that the toxicity depends on the entirety of all processed chemicals i e non intentionally added substances in each plastic material groh et al 2019 lambert wagner 2017 in view of the biodegradability of bio pbs and sb it could be argued that antagonistic activities were affected by dissolved organic carbon doc as an interfering matrix neale et al 2015 following this reasoning both the bio pbs and sb should have yielded alike antagonistic activities but this was not the case e g comp the response of sb in fig 3 and fig 4 hence the doc is probably but not certainly negligible in addition we identified ldpe r and the pvc samples pvc a and pvc r to cause elevated activities the recycled ldpe resulted in high activities across all bioassays fig 5 since recyclates can contain significantly higher amounts of hazardous chemicals comp dreolin et al 2018 and our ldpe r pellets comprised various colors and forms fig s1 we expected elevated in vitro activities due to composite ldpe materials along that line li et al 2016 found leachates of recyclable pvc and ldpe consumer products to be toxic for the barnacle larvae amphibalanus amphitrite pvc leachates were determined as ecotoxicologically relevant as well by lithner et al 2012 2009 oliviero et al 2019 and tetu et al 2019 in our study the pvc samples slightly induced oxidative stress fig 2 table s8 suggesting that pvc contains electrophilic chemicals or chemicals generating reactive oxygen species escher et al 2013 zimmermann et al 2019 identified consumer products made from pvc as one of the most potent plastics that induced baseline toxicity oxidative stress as well as estrogenic and antiandrogenic activities our findings further demonstrate that pvc can induce other specific receptor mediated effects such as antiestrogenicity fig 3 these observations are not surprising because plasticizers and stabilizers are used in high amounts for pvc groh et al 2019 hahladakis et al 2018 4 2 toxicologically less relevant plastics focusing again on the leachables from the dark control t1 the following samples exhibited no activities almost across all bioassays pp h pp c pet a pet r ps hi ps gp and ldpe fig 5 in the present study these samples represent plastics of comparably lower chemical content pp pet ps and ldpe are polymers that are commonly used as food packaging materials plasticseurope 2019 and are thus in contact with human food the european union regulates eu commission 2011 certain substances for the production of plastic materials and such in contact with food muncke et al 2020 suggesting that these materials do not contain hazardous chemicals while zimmermann et al 2019 somewhat support this by reporting less but not complete absence of toxicological activities for such plastic products they also describe that a generalized toxicological statement is not feasible for these materials because their toxicities varied yang et al 2011 provided similar results pet and pp products exhibited estrogenicity in the e screen mcf7 cells whereas ldpe and the moiety of ps did not contain estrogen like compounds this means in effect that food contact plastics contain concerning chemicals and indicates that regulatory enforcements are not as strict as preferable comp daniel et al 2018 after all non intentionally added substances can only be limitedly assessed and leaching chemical mixtures are currently not taken into account by eu regulations muncke et al 2020 furthermore the polymer types discussed in this section can also be used for other applications e g as pp pipes or ps insulation plasticseurope 2019 mertl et al 2014 for instance determined antagonistic activities for pp granulate intended for use as water pipes schiavo et al 2018 did not detect significant luminescence inhibitions for a fischeri following exposure to virgin pe and ps pellets whereas minor inductions were observed in the arec32 and pparγ assay for milled 350 µm pe and ps pellets rummel et al 2019 this highlights once again that the activities depend on the customized chemical composition of each plastic material nonetheless we also demonstrate that seven materials did not release harmful chemicals after the dark control this could be simply attributed to the mild extraction i e with water and without irradiation in the reference treatment t1 4 3 complex plastic formulations we further assumed that the plastic formulation i e additive content plays an important role when evaluating plastic toxicity as more and more chemicals are added along the production chain real et al 2015 it could be more likely to detect toxicological activities in final products rather than in pre production pellets rummel et al 2019 zimmermann et al 2020 however for the present study such a comparison is not advisable because our materials only included two final plastic products and various plastic formulations we still expected the recyclates to result in higher toxicities than their counterparts since previous studies described unintentional accumulations of hazardous chemicals in plastic recyclates fatunsin et al 2020 ionas et al 2014 pivnenko et al 2017 2016 turner 2018 as this was true only for the ldpe r which represents post industrial cuttings from manufactured plastic products table 1 fig s1 this underpins that the recyclates chemical composition depends on the waste source pivnenko et al 2016 pvc r for instance released bioactive chemicals but displayed mitigated activities compared to pvc a fig 5 moreover we found no baseline toxicity fig 1 and insignificant antagonistic activities for the post consumer pet r fig 3 fig 4 even though recycled pet bottles have been already determined as a source for the reentrance of endocrine disruptors lee et al 2014 dreolin et al 2018 even demonstrated that six out of eight recycled pet pellets contained more than 1 µg of the estrogen mimicking substance bisphenol a per gram of the examined samples 4 4 plastic toxicity after weathering uv irradiation combined with high ambient temperatures initiates polymer degradation andrady et al 1998 which results in the release of plastic associated chemicals groh et al 2019 and formation of newly emerging degradation products gewert et al 2018 as already described see 4 1 and 4 2 uv light as an initiator for degradation is not necessary to detect in vitro toxicities comp dark control however the toxicities were generally enhanced after uv application e g from 57 8 t1 to 70 5 t2 of antiandrogenicity for ldpe r fig 4 table s8 new activities emerged as well due to uv irradiation e g for ps samples across all bioassays fig 5 highlighting that even polymeric formulas consisting of low chemical complexity see table s9 can release or form toxic chemicals our findings are not unexpected but demonstrate the importance of weathering in the environment with regard to the chemical pollution originating from plastics yang et al 2011 determined uv light as a driving force to release estrogen like compounds coffin et al 2018 support this as they detected higher estrogenic and dioxin like activities for irradiated virgin plastics than for untreated samples rummel et al 2019 demonstrated as well that most uv treated plastics exhibited increased oxidative stress compared to a reference treatment aside from these in vitro studies weathering also exacerbated the plastics toxicity in in vivo tests e g for virgin and mixed plastics coffin et al 2018 xu et al 2020 bejgarn et al 2015 for instance exposed nitocra spinipes to uv irradiated plastic leachates and detected increased as well as decreased toxicities after uv irradiation sarker et al 2020 reported as well that two environmentally weathered products i e pvc matting and hdpe grocery bag affected prochlorococcus but the bacterial growth was less inhibited compared to the treatment with unweathered plastics this was observed once in our study fig 2 illustrates a minor reduction of the ecir1 5 for ldpe r following uv application from 14 7 mg t1 to 19 0 mg t4 plastic eqs table s8 interestingly a corn starch and aliphatic polyester based biodegradable bag was significantly more toxic than prior to irradiation bejgarn et al 2015 which is in line with our findings for the sb sample furthermore we observed elevated inductions after specific weathering types most findings stem from uv c t2 followed by uv a baq t4 uv a b t3 and the dark control t1 fig s5 based on the literature it is not really surprising that uv light enhanced the plastics toxicity however it is noteworthy that minor plastic eqs already induced concerning effects i e either less than 668 mg and 222 mg in the microtox and arec32 assay or 111 mg in the antagonistic assays to give an example 11 7 mg well 1 t4 of ldpe r eqs affected 20 of the bacteria in the microtox assay while the same effect was achieved with 0 64 µg well 1 of 3 5 dichlorophenol as positive control this corresponds to 4 26 mg of 3 5 dichlorophenol l 1 which is harmful to aquatic life norman network 2021 hence we believe that this assessment of leachable plastic chemicals is somewhat mirroring the current ongoing process in the environment considering the million tons of plastics annually polluting the aquatic systems lebreton et al 2017 since the chemical release can be related to the uv intensity andrady et al 1998 temperature yang et al 2011 and or surface area of the material muncke et al 2020 in contact with a specific type of solvent szczepańska et al 2016 detectable components and toxicological findings may vary depending on the extraction method used our experiments represent mild exposure scenarios due to the uv intensity table s2 and table s3 in si and short contact time with a soft medium i e 24 h in water because the atmospheric uv irradiation led to elevated temperatures t2 45 2 and t3 40 7 c after which we noticed yellowed samples and a strong synthetic smell the toxicities might be closely linked to these temperatures table s5 tsochatzis et al 2020 depicted that temperature i e 20 40 and 60 c over a time period of 10 days had a substantial effect on the release of two compounds typically found in food contact materials likewise yang et al 2011 found more detectable estrogenic activities for samples following moist heat treatments e g via autoclave process in the present study both the temperature and uv light have to be considered as two influencing factors on the chemical migration however bandow et al 2017 tested the release rates of in organic compounds of recycled plastic pellets or disks and has shown that photo oxidation has a greater influence on chemical release than thermo oxidative conditions i e a high temperature cai et al 2018 demonstrated in a similar methodological design that pellets weathered under atmospheric conditions were more prone to degradation than in aqueous medium the same is true for our weathering scenarios we observed mitigated toxicological activities for t4 uv a baq in comparison to t2 uv c fig s5 this might be attributed to the water diffusing uv light through absorption and reflection uv c irradiation serving as a worst case scenario on the other hand probably leads to toxic transformation products due to the high energetic radiation since previous studies deliberately increased the plastics surface area for leaching purposes bejgarn et al 2015 rummel et al 2019 we statistically analyzed whether the surface area table s1 correlates with the observed toxicities our data do not support that a greater surface area leads to a higher toxicity but rather that the effects depend on leachable toxicants present in individual plastic samples admittedly comparing pellets and milled fragments could be more conclusive comp ye et al 2020 4 5 diversity of chemical components this study aimed to elucidate whether plastic chemicals are increasingly released after uv weathering and whether these chemicals are interlinked with the observed toxicities due to weathering we observed increased component counts for almost every sample however the sb leached fewer chemicals after each uv treatment whereas the ldpe r released fewer chemicals solely after atmospheric weathering fig 5 table s9 most of these chemicals are low molecular fragments exemplified in fig s6 for pvc a which are formed to a higher extent due to degradation as a result the number and amount of components generally cluster after the uv treatments table s9 this is in line with the toxicological findings fig s5 e g uv c as a worst case scenario revealed most positive findings in view of the chemicals we cannot narrow down the main driver for the toxicities as this would be only feasible via effect directed analysis although we did not majorly focus on chemical identification future studies should address this in order to determine yet unknown substances responsible for adverse effects our chemical data are generally in accordance with other studies considering analytical differences using lc orbitrap ms gewert et al 2018 detected similarly low counts for pp ps and pe pellets while pet pellets gewert et al 2018 as well as bottles wagner et al 2013 leached higher chemical counts bradley and coulier 2007 as well as qian et al 2018 detected more chemicals for pp than in our study pp h 41 t1 table s9 however they deployed either a wide variety of techniques in order to detect semi volatile polar and or non volatile substances bradley coulier 2007 or a large selection of plastics 35 pp products in qian et al 2018 interestingly bradley coulier 2007 ascribed the majority of detected chemicals in the examined high commodity plastics to impurities and breakdown products as for pvc and bio associated plastics zimmermann et al 2019 obtained low to high chemical counts for extracts from pvc products analyzed with gc qtof ms zimmermann et al 2020 further employed an analytical system comparable to our study and observed between 880 and 20 965 chemicals for pla pbs pbat and starch based materials a detailed identification and classification of the plastic associated chemicals was beyond the scope of our study we still identified some of the detected components not displayed with the attribute tentative confident or confirmed these included stabilizers e g benzophenone benzothiazoles benzotriazoles plasticizers e g n butylbenzenesulfonamide acetyltributylcitrate organophosphorus compounds e g dibutyl and tributyl phosphates antioxidants e g irganox 1098 benzoquinone fenozan different benzoic acids and 1 3 diphenylguanidine most of these compounds occurred almost after every treatment while a small fraction was specific to one treatment we further identified many degradants especially for the biodegradable plastics the majority of detected compounds still remained unknown although this might be attributed to the depth of the chemical analysis in the main the chemical analysis demonstrated that plastics comprise low and high chemical contents and that chemicals are increasingly released due to initiating degradation processes for example by uv light and hydrolysis overall this hampers a proper risk assessment for aquatic organisms because new degradation products are continuously formed even if degradants would not be an issue there are many registered chemicals publicly not disclosed i e over 50 000 chemicals as analyzed by wang et al 2020 this lack of transparency applies likewise for chemicals used in plastics and needs to be improved urgently groh et al 2019 however this also puts the application of diverse chemicals into question as toxicologically rather less harmful polymeric formulas already exist 5 conclusions our results demonstrate that differently formulated plastics include chemicals inducing baseline toxicity oxidative stress and antagonistic activities some plastics affected several in vitro endpoints whereas others caused little to no effects the toxicities varied even for the same polymer type as a result we cannot attribute a toxicological profile to a specific polymer type because activities depended on the customized chemical composition of each plastic moreover we demonstrate that uv irradiation exacerbated the plastics toxicities even for plastics initially evaluated as toxicologically harmless the atmospheric scenario with uv c irradiation had the strongest impact followed by aquatic weathering uv a baq the atmospheric uv a b and the dark control dc as reference a high number of chemical components was detected in the aqueous leachates by non target analysis whether they were toxic or not every tested plastic sample released chemicals such were increasingly observed due to uv irradiation whereas most chemicals were detected after uv a baq in general we exemplified the chemical heterogeneity in polymeric formulations e g for plastic pellets as well as products and showed that uv light facilitates the chemical release it is noteworthy that we only assessed some un specific mediated effects with bacterial human and yeast cells but chemicals in plastics may affect health in ways that are currently not yet fully understood in order to prevent the exposure to plastic associated chemicals mitigation of release of chemicals should be addressed during product development but the application of chemicals could be generally reduced to a minimum on a regulatory level the testing of singular compounds is of specific concern since our chemical data point to mixture effects we believe that the evaluation of plastic eluates could be another important focal point

16973,plastics can release numerous chemicals and thereby contribute to the chemical pollution in aquatic systems to which extent environmental degradation processes influence the release of plastic chemicals is currently unknown and subject of research we therefore evaluated aqueous leachates of 12 differently formulated plastics e g pre production post industrial and recycled pellets as well as final products using in vitro bioassays and chemical analysis via lc hrms nontarget approach we weathered these plastics by uv irradiation uv c and uv a b under laboratory conditions in dryness and a

the plastic samples caused oxidative stress 85 baseline toxicity 42 antiestrogenicity 40 and antiandrogenicity 27 positive findings were measured after uv c 63 and uv a baq 50 treatments followed by uv a b 48 and dc 33 overall we detected between 42 dc and 2896 uv a baq chemical compounds our study demonstrates that differently formulated plastics leach toxic chemicals uv exacerbates the plastics toxicity by either generating active compounds and or by facilitating their release uv light even leads to the release of bioactive compounds from plastics of low chemical complexity to prevent the exposure to plastic associated chemicals the application of chemicals could be reduced to a minimum while on a regulatory level the evaluation of plastic eluates could be another focal point next to

pollution is a global challenge as approximately 1 15 2 41 million tons annually enter the ocean through riverine systems lebreton et al 2017 in the environment plastics are subject to weathering such

slipping agents and residues and small polymer units i e monomers and oligomers gewert et al 2015 hahladakis et al 2018 plastic associated chemicals contribute likely to the existing chemical pollution persson et al 2013 whereas low concentrations of e g plasticizers can induce adverse biological effects oehlmann et al 2009 teuten et al 2009 in this context our understanding for plastic mediated effects has to be improved on a chemical level fauser et al 2020 previous studies investigated the toxicity of virgin plastic pellets gandara e silva et al 2016 nobre et al 2015 schiavo et al 2018 and commercially available plastic products li et al 2016 lithner et al 2009 oliviero et al 2019 for a variety of aquatic organisms adverse effects were generally attributed to leached chemicals from virgin i e supposedly free from added chemicals and processed or recycled i e high additive content plastics however only a few studies so far addressed the toxicological effects of leachates from uv weathered plastic materials bejgarn et al 2015 especially with in vitro bioassays coffin et al 2018 rummel et al 2019 yang et al 2011 as a consequence potential environmental hazards from uv induced plastic degradation products have been studied to a lesser degree gewert et al 2018 the present study focused on these aspects by examining in vitro toxicities of plastic leachates following artificial weathering scenarios therefore we selected a diverse range of plastics including seven petroleum based plastics three recyclates as well as two biodegradable and fully or partly bio based materials the plastics were chosen dependent on their high production volume increasing recycling rates plasticseurope 2019 and social perception as clean alternatives because property modifying chemicals are added to plastics derived from renewable feedstocks lambert wagner 2017 and to reused plastics bodar et al 2018 pivnenko et al 2016 schyns shaver 2020 examinations on adverse effects of such materials are just as important as for conventional plastics the main objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of uv on the leaching behavior of chemicals as integral components of plastic material and the related toxicological impact we simulated weathering by either atmospheric uv irradiation with a subsequent leaching period or directly under aquatic conditions leached chemicals were concentrated and screened in in vitro bioassays to assess the baseline toxicity microtox assay oxidative stress response arec32 assay and antagonistic activities at nuclear sex hormone receptors yeast based reporter gene assays finally we analyzed the released plastic associated compounds by high performance liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry lc qtof ms 2 material and methods 2 1 test materials the following polymer types were chosen polypropylene pp polyethylene terephthalate pet polystyrene ps low density polyethylene ldpe and polyvinylchloride pvc as petroleum based plastics pet ldpe and pvc were also tested as recyclates r and bio based polybutylene succinate bio pbs and a starch blend sb as biodegradable plastics the sb contains polybutylene adipate terephthalate pbat thermoplastic starch glycerin and polylactic acid pla and thus represents a petroleum and bio based material table 1 each plastic category comprised two materials table 1 which were obtained from project partners as pellets 5 mm except for two pvc products fig s1 the pvc samples transparent plate and sheet pile were cut to pellet like pieces and thereby increased in surface area to achieve similar leaching conditions to record the leachable surface area 100 pellets of every plastic sample were measured on each dimension 0 001 mm using a stereo microscope olympus sz40 and extrapolated to the tested mass table s1 2 2 artificial weathering 100 g of each plastic were evenly distributed in 2 l duran crystallizing dishes 190 mm in diameter all glass products were rinsed prior to use with acetone and annealed at 200 c for at least 3 h test vessels were placed in a chamber with ventilation holes constructed with two uv lamps attached on each level fig s2 table s2 under laboratory conditions the test materials were irradiated for 24 h by either uv c at 250 nm treatment 2 t2 worst case scenario at 45 2 c as ambient temperature or uv a b at 280 400 nm t3 daylight scenario at 40 7 c and subsequently leached for 24 h in 1 1 l of ultrapure water both treatments represent atmospheric exposure conditions to cover potential volatile compounds the test materials were leached for 24 h in 1 1 l of ultrapure water during uv a b irradiation uv a baq at 33 4 c t4 aquatic scenario a corresponding dark control t1 was not irradiated darkness at 23 9 c but treated identically temperatures were recorded in 5 minute intervals using data loggers hobo pendant onset computer corporation bourne usa table s5 the listed temperatures relate to the temperature during the uv procedures since the uv lamps were deactivated for the leaching procedure in t2 and t3 the temperatures naturally decreased t2 25 7 c and t3 24 3 c in the dark control the temperature remained similar during the leaching 23 1 c procedural blanks with water only were included for each treatment to assess background contaminations uv intensities radiometer rm

simulated 8 16 h of european sun exposure table s4 in supporting information si and thus displayed mild exposure conditions compared to gewert et al 2018 leachates were then separated from test materials via büchner funnels into erlenmeyer flasks of which 100 ml were taken and measured ph and conductivity with a portable multimeter hq40d hach lange gmbh düsseldorf germany table s6 2 3 solid phase extraction 1 l of each leachate was acidified to ph 2 5 with sulfuric acid 3 5 mol l 1 and enriched by solid phase extraction spe with telos c18 env cartridges kinesis gmbh wertheim germany to retain hydrophobic compounds abbas et al 2019 before sample loading columns were conditioned with 2 ml heptane 2 ml acetone 6 ml methanol pro analysis and 8 ml ultrapure water a spe blank was prepared with 1 l ultrapure water columns were dried under a stream of nitrogen and eluted with 5 ml acetone and 5 ml methanol of which 200 µl were stored at 20 c for chemical analysis the remaining eluates contained 89 1 g of plastic equivalents eqs 200 µl of dimethyl sulfoxide dmso was added to the plastic eluates and concentrated under a stream of nitrogen to 200 µl as final extract volume these 5000 fold concentrated extracts were stored at 20 c prior to testing 2 4 in vitro bioassays 2 4 1 microtox assay the microtox assay with the bioluminescent bacterium aliivibrio fischeri assessed the baseline toxicity iso 11348 3 2007 the assay was performed according to völker et al 2017 with minor modifications control samples negative and solvent controls spe blank procedural blanks a reference compound 3 5 dichlorophenol table s7 fig s3a and plastic extracts were tested in duplicates reaching 1 v v as solvent concentration per well considering a 0 30 to 37 5 fold enrichment the tested plastic extracts are equivalent to 5 22 668 mg plastic for a better understanding the results were expressed in plastic eqs where 1 mg of plastic eqs corresponds to all leachables from 1 mg of plastic pellets in total three to four independent experiments were conducted 2 4 2 arec32 assay the arec32 assay with the human breast cancer cell line mcf7 assessed the oxidative stress response i e the cellular detoxification mechanism wang et al 2006 the cell line obtained from signosis inc santa clara ca usa included the nrf2 are signaling pathway coupled to a luciferase reporter gene following the procedure described by völker et al 2017 the assay was conducted with minor modifications control samples comp 2 4 1 reference compound tert butylhydroquinone table s7 fig s3b and plastic extracts were examined in duplicates per independent experiment three to five in total not exceeding a final solvent concentration of 0 5 v v the plastic samples corresponded to 1 74 222 mg plastic eqs which resulted in 0 10 to 12 5 fold concentrated extracts 2 4 3 yeast based reporter gene assays yeast based reporter gene lacz encoding for β galactosidase assays were conducted to assess the endocrine activity as preliminary screens revealed few estrogenic and androgenic findings but resulted in high antagonistic activities we examined the antagonistic activity at the human estrogen receptor α herα routledge sumpter 1996 and human androgen receptor har sohoni sumpter 1998 respectively therefore the yeast anti estrogen screen yaes and yeast anti androgen screen yaas were conducted as in abbas et al 2019 with minor modifications cell densities were adjusted to 250 25 yaes and 500 50 yaas of formazine attenuation units assays were performed in 96 well plates with eight technical replicates for each sample controls comp 2 4 1 reference compounds 4 hydroxytamoxifen yaes and flutamide yaas table s7 fig s3c d not exceeding 0 2 v v as solvent concentration the plastic samples contained 111 mg plastic eqs this means that 6 2 fold concentrated extracts were tested to detect antagonistic activities 17β estradiol yaes and testosterone yaas were added as agonists to the medium hence antagonistic compounds such as antiestrogens or antiandrogens inhibit the corresponding agonist from receptor activation and reduce the reporter gene activity in total three to five independent experiments were conducted 2 5 data analysis to derive concentration response curves and effect concentrations ecs nonlinear regressions were performed using a four parameter logistic function graphpad prism 5 and 8 graphpad software inc san diego ca usa cytotoxic samples were generally excluded from analysis and independent experiments were only considered for analysis when the half maximal response ec50 was next to the listed concentrations in table s7 for the microtox assay the luminescence inhibition of procedural blanks was subtracted from the respective samples ec20 values were derived for samples exceeding the 20 inhibition threshold and describe the plastic eq inducing this inhibition therefore the minimum and maximum effect was constrained to 0 and 100 inhibition respectively for the arec32 assay solvent controls and procedural blanks were pooled due to no significant differences kruskal wallis test followed by dunn s multiple comparison test α 0 05 the minimum effect was constrained to an induction ratio ir of 1 and derived ecir1 5 values refer to the plastic eq inducing a 1 5 fold elevated signaling pathway for yeast screens antagonistic activities were normalized to a minimum and maximum effect represented by a control with agonist 0 receptor inhibition and without agonist 100 receptor inhibition negative and solvent controls as well as procedural blanks were pooled as described before and used to derive the limit of detection lod activities above the lod calculated with pooled controls plus three times the standard deviation were considered significant to identify toxicity patterns data were normalized as relative activities and compared in a heat map therefore the highest ec value from either the microtox or arec32 assay corresponded to an activity of 0 while 100 was set to 0 0001 mg plastic eqs 2 6 chemical analysis the spe eluates section 2 3 were measured via hplc ms ms as described previously in detail nürenberg et al 2015 analysis was performed using a tripletof 6600 sciex coupled via an esi source to a binary hplc instrument 1260 infinity agilent equipped with a reversed phase c18 column zorbax eclipse plus 2 1 mm x 150 mm 3 5 µm agilent as eluent a water acetonitril gradient was used buffered with 0 1vol formic acid at a flow of 300 µl min 1 the method used both esi and esi ionization mode scan mode 100 1200 da samples were diluted 1 1 with ultrapure water and injected at 50 µl the data analysis was processed according a non target approach as described by jewell et al 2020 and köppe et al 2020 after data acquisition peak picking componentization alignment of the components and blank correction the components and their intensity were summed for each sample and ionization mode the data are summarized in table s9 the total count and intensity of all detected components were normalized according to the highest and lowest values and displayed in the heat map the intensity is used as an indicator for the approximate amount of chemicals in one sample derived from the most intense feature of the component 3 results 3 1 microtox assay the spe blank induced negligible luminescence inhibitions with 4 40 1 55 table s8 solvent controls did not inhibit the luminescence resulting in non derivable ec20 values not listed in table s8 procedural blanks as background contaminations were subtracted from the respective samples table s8 seven out of the 12 plastics induced baseline toxicity fig 1 pvc pvc a pvc r and ps samples ps gp ps hi as well as the bio pbs sb and the ldpe r resulted in low ec20 values high effect fig 1 fig 5 efficacies ranged from the lowest effect with 341 90 1 mg t2 ps gp to the highest effect with 7 32 3 59 mg t2 ldpe r fig 1 table s8 the ldpe r induced the highest observed effect in the microtox assay both biodegradable plastics and the ldpe r were the most potent plastics for every weathering treatment fig s4 the toxicities generally depended on the applied weathering condition for instance uv c provoked elevated toxicities for ps samples whereas no effect was observed in the dark control fig 1 fig 5 no observed effects correspond to 750 mg plastic eqs and were also found for pp h pp c pet a pet r and ldpe fig 1 fig 5 the toxicity order for treatments was the following in the microtox assay uv c uv a b and uv a baq dc fig s5 moreover we observed that this assay had one of the highest relative positive findings fig s5 3 2 arec32 assay few samples did not activate the nrf2 are signaling pathway which corresponds to 250 mg plastic eqs the spe blank not displayed in fig 2 induced the oxidative stress response with 206 20 6 mg table s8 similar minor inductions can be observed for pooled background contaminations and solvent controls abbreviated c from 229 13 6 t1 to 196 19 3 mg t3 fig 2 compared to the microtox assay the response is more differentiated in the human cell line fig 2 fig 5 every plastic material but not every tested weathering scenario induced a 1 5 fold elevated response for instance specific weathering types induced no effects for six out of 12 plastics e g for t3 and t4 pet a or t1 and t3 ps hi the most potent samples were ldpe r t1 14 7 2 11 mg and sb lowest ecir1 5 in t2 35 2 4 90 mg followed by pvc a t4 49 6 8 72 mg fig 5 table s8 as in the microtox assay fig s4 ldpe r and sb again induced the highest observed effects overall the weathering toxicity resulted in the following order for the arec32 assay uv c uv a baq uv a b dc this assay had the highest rate of positive findings fig s5 3 3 yeast based reporter gene assays in the yeast anti estrogen screen the spe blank inhibited the human estrogen receptor herα by 7 41 1 41 not displayed in fig 3 see table s8 pooled controls had minor effects with 1 56 0 74 inhibition t2 c fig 3 table s8 samples 20 2 lod of antiestrogenicity were considered as significant fig 3 every plastic material inhibited the receptor and thus leached antiestrogenic compounds fig 3 table s8 significantly increased activities were observed for seven out of the 12 plastics i e ldpe r pvc a sb bio pbs pvc r ps hi and ps gp for either every weathering scenario ldpe r and bio bps or only specific treatments the strongest antiestrogenic activity was observed for t3 ldpe r with 75 4 1 97 fig 3 table s8 comparable inhibitions were achieved with the pvc a t2 62 0 1 85 and pvc r sample t2 54 2 2 23 fig 3 table s8 in general uv c irradiation t2 led to pronounced effects for eight out of 12 plastics fig 5 resulting in the following weathering toxicity order in the yaes uv c uv a b uv a baq and dc fig s5 the yaes resulted in a lower positive finding rate than the microtox and arec32 assay regarding the yeast anti androgen screen we observed inhibitions of the human androgen receptor har for the spe blank with 13 0 2 52 not displayed in fig 4 see table s8 here activities 31 3 lod were considered significant pooled background contaminations and solvent controls c had their highest impact for t3 2 91 1 64 fig 4 table s8 all plastic samples inhibited the har fig 4 but activities depended on the applied weathering scenario the following samples led to a significant increase in antiandrogenic activity ldpe r sb bio pbs pvc a ps hi and ps gp fig 4 table s8 hence six out of 12 plastics resulted in significant antiandrogenicity compared to the yaes fig 3 we observed lower activities for pvc samples fig 4 high activities were again detected for ldpe r and sb fig 5 here uv a b irradiation during leaching t4 revealed to be the most affecting treatment with 96 2 0 44 for ldpe r and 86 3 0 11 for sb fig 5 table s8 in contrast to the yaes fig 3 only four plastics revealed pronounced antiandrogenic activities after uv c irradiation fig 5 the toxicity order for the treatments in the yaas is as follows uv c and uv a baq uv a b dc fig s5 finally we observed the lowest rate of positive findings in the yaas fig s5 3 4 chemical analysis the results of the screening via lc qtof can be used to get an overview about the chemical complexity of the leachates and for a rough estimation of the released amounts due to high differences in detector response for different molecules in lc ms analysis a comparison of particular plastic samples is very limited however the data revealed obvious differences in leaching from the particular plastic samples and uv induced changes fig 5 illustrates the component counts and intensities of the plastic eluates after subtraction of the procedural blanks when combining the positively and negatively ionized components we detected between 42 t1 pp h and 2896 t4 ldpe r compounds table s9 ldpe r both biodegradable plastics and pvc samples contained the highest counts pet ps pp samples and the ldpe released fewer components e g 855 for t2 pet r and 410 for t2 ps hi in general we detected a higher count for positively ionized than for negatively ionized components except for the bio pbs and ldpe table s9 moreover ldpe r bio pbs and sb showed the highest intensities fig 5 table s9 a clear influence by uv irradiation could not be observed for these plastics however other plastics such as pvc a and the pet a and pet r showed a strong increase in intensities after artificial weathering table s9 4 discussion 4 1 toxicity of plastics not subject of irradiation in the dark control t1 we identified toxicological activities for five out of 12 plastics i e the ldpe r sb bio pbs pvc a and pvc r fig 5 this highlights that uv light as an initiator of degradation is not an essential prerequisite for plastics to release toxic chemicals one of the most striking finding is the high toxicity resulting from sb and bio pbs indicating that biodegradable plastics emit active chemicals as well however this does not comply with the expectation that degradation products of biodegradable plastics should not exhibit any ecotoxicity lambert wagner 2017 in this study the sb sample induced in vitro activities comparable to the most potent non biodegradable sample ldpe r and thus was one of the most toxic samples both the bio pbs and sb are either fully bio pbs or only partly sb derived from renewable feedstock and are both biodegradable since such plastics are usually deployed as foils in agriculture they are usually examined in terms of seed germination thus cell culture studies are rare souza et al 2020 moreover bio associated plastics i e bio based and or biodegradable often comprise blends of several materials making a toxicological evaluation difficult the sb sample for instance represents a blend of polybutylene adipate terephthalate pbat thermoplastic starch glycerin and polylactic acid pla the latter can be used as a contact material e g for foodstuff farah et al 2016 and has been investigated more often than other bio associated plastics for instance zimmermann et al 2019 and yang et al 2011 used harsh extraction methods and linked pla products to baseline toxicity and estrogenicity respectively corn starch based foils were found to stimulate the bioluminescence of aliivibrio fischeri although the significant stimulant level was not exceeded sforzini et al 2016 furthermore souza et al 2020 observed decreased cellular viability for hepg2 c3a cells when exposed to pbat extracts our bio pbs sample induced high baseline toxicity as well as medium antiestrogenic and antiandrogenic responses fig 5 in contrast to specific compounds binding to nuclear receptors e g endocrine disruptors the bacterial and human cell assays are both sensitive to many stressors the oxidative stress response however can be induced selectively as well escher et al 2014 therefore it is not surprising that our bio pbs mostly affected one unspecific endpoint plastics active in the microtox assay did not necessarily translate to effects in the arec32 assay and vice versa fig 5 moreover toso et al 2017 assessed pbs foils with cultured t lymphocytes as non toxic zimmermann et al 2020 recently surveyed a broad range of bio associated plastics and assigned high baseline toxicity as well as antiandrogenicity to materials based on starch while extracts of pla pbs and pbat resulted in varied toxicities overall these results suggest that the toxicity depends on the entirety of all processed chemicals i e non intentionally added substances in each plastic material groh et al 2019 lambert wagner 2017 in view of the biodegradability of bio pbs and sb it could be argued that antagonistic activities were affected by dissolved organic carbon doc as an interfering matrix neale et al 2015 following this reasoning both the bio pbs and sb should have yielded alike antagonistic activities but this was not the case e g comp the response of sb in fig 3 and fig 4 hence the doc is probably but not certainly negligible in addition we identified ldpe r and the pvc samples pvc a and pvc r to cause elevated activities the recycled ldpe resulted in high activities across all bioassays fig 5 since recyclates can contain significantly higher amounts of hazardous chemicals comp dreolin et al 2018 and our ldpe r pellets comprised various colors and forms fig s1 we expected elevated in vitro activities due to composite ldpe materials along that line li et al 2016 found leachates of recyclable pvc and ldpe consumer products to be toxic for the barnacle larvae amphibalanus amphitrite pvc leachates were determined as ecotoxicologically relevant as well by lithner et al 2012 2009 oliviero et al 2019 and tetu et al 2019 in our study the pvc samples slightly induced oxidative stress fig 2 table s8 suggesting that pvc contains electrophilic chemicals or chemicals generating reactive oxygen species escher et al 2013 zimmermann et al 2019 identified consumer products made from pvc as one of the most potent plastics that induced baseline toxicity oxidative stress as well as estrogenic and antiandrogenic activities our findings further demonstrate that pvc can induce other specific receptor mediated effects such as antiestrogenicity fig 3 these observations are not surprising because plasticizers and stabilizers are used in high amounts for pvc groh et al 2019 hahladakis et al 2018 4 2 toxicologically less relevant plastics focusing again on the leachables from the dark control t1 the following samples exhibited no activities almost across all bioassays pp h pp c pet a pet r ps hi ps gp and ldpe fig 5 in the present study these samples represent plastics of comparably lower chemical content pp pet ps and ldpe are polymers that are commonly used as food packaging materials plasticseurope 2019 and are thus in contact with human food the european union regulates eu commission 2011 certain substances for the production of plastic materials and such in contact with food muncke et al 2020 suggesting that these materials do not contain hazardous chemicals while zimmermann et al 2019 somewhat support this by reporting less but not complete absence of toxicological activities for such plastic products they also describe that a generalized toxicological statement is not feasible for these materials because their toxicities varied yang et al 2011 provided similar results pet and pp products exhibited estrogenicity in the e screen mcf7 cells whereas ldpe and the moiety of ps did not contain estrogen like compounds this means in effect that food contact plastics contain concerning chemicals and indicates that regulatory enforcements are not as strict as preferable comp daniel et al 2018 after all non intentionally added substances can only be limitedly assessed and leaching chemical mixtures are currently not taken into account by eu regulations muncke et al 2020 furthermore the polymer types discussed in this section can also be used for other applications e g as pp pipes or ps insulation plasticseurope 2019 mertl et al 2014 for instance determined antagonistic activities for pp granulate intended for use as water pipes schiavo et al 2018 did not detect significant luminescence inhibitions for a fischeri following exposure to virgin pe and ps pellets whereas minor inductions were observed in the arec32 and pparγ assay for milled 350 µm pe and ps pellets rummel et al 2019 this highlights once again that the activities depend on the customized chemical composition of each plastic material nonetheless we also demonstrate that seven materials did not release harmful chemicals after the dark control this could be simply attributed to the mild extraction i e with water and without irradiation in the reference treatment t1 4 3 complex plastic formulations we further assumed that the plastic formulation i e additive content plays an important role when evaluating plastic toxicity as more and more chemicals are added along the production chain real et al 2015 it could be more likely to detect toxicological activities in final products rather than in pre production pellets rummel et al 2019 zimmermann et al 2020 however for the present study such a comparison is not advisable because our materials only included two final plastic products and various plastic formulations we still expected the recyclates to result in higher toxicities than their counterparts since previous studies described unintentional accumulations of hazardous chemicals in plastic recyclates fatunsin et al 2020 ionas et al 2014 pivnenko et al 2017 2016 turner 2018 as this was true only for the ldpe r which represents post industrial cuttings from manufactured plastic products table 1 fig s1 this underpins that the recyclates chemical composition depends on the waste source pivnenko et al 2016 pvc r for instance released bioactive chemicals but displayed mitigated activities compared to pvc a fig 5 moreover we found no baseline toxicity fig 1 and insignificant antagonistic activities for the post consumer pet r fig 3 fig 4 even though recycled pet bottles have been already determined as a source for the reentrance of endocrine disruptors lee et al 2014 dreolin et al 2018 even demonstrated that six out of eight recycled pet pellets contained more than 1 µg of the estrogen mimicking substance bisphenol a per gram of the examined samples 4 4 plastic toxicity after weathering uv irradiation combined with high ambient temperatures initiates polymer degradation andrady et al 1998 which results in the release of plastic associated chemicals groh et al 2019 and formation of newly emerging degradation products gewert et al 2018 as already described see 4 1 and 4 2 uv light as an initiator for degradation is not necessary to detect in vitro toxicities comp dark control however the toxicities were generally enhanced after uv application e g from 57 8 t1 to 70 5 t2 of antiandrogenicity for ldpe r fig 4 table s8 new activities emerged as well due to uv irradiation e g for ps samples across all bioassays fig 5 highlighting that even polymeric formulas consisting of low chemical complexity see table s9 can release or form toxic chemicals our findings are not unexpected but demonstrate the importance of weathering in the environment with regard to the chemical pollution originating from plastics yang et al 2011 determined uv light as a driving force to release estrogen like compounds coffin et al 2018 support this as they detected higher estrogenic and dioxin like activities for irradiated virgin plastics than for untreated samples rummel et al 2019 demonstrated as well that most uv treated plastics exhibited increased oxidative stress compared to a reference treatment aside from these in vitro studies weathering also exacerbated the plastics toxicity in in vivo tests e g for virgin and mixed plastics coffin et al 2018 xu et al 2020 bejgarn et al 2015 for instance exposed nitocra spinipes to uv irradiated plastic leachates and detected increased as well as decreased toxicities after uv irradiation sarker et al 2020 reported as well that two environmentally weathered products i e pvc matting and hdpe grocery bag affected prochlorococcus but the bacterial growth was less inhibited compared to the treatment with unweathered plastics this was observed once in our study fig 2 illustrates a minor reduction of the ecir1 5 for ldpe r following uv application from 14 7 mg t1 to 19 0 mg t4 plastic eqs table s8 interestingly a corn starch and aliphatic polyester based biodegradable bag was significantly more toxic than prior to irradiation bejgarn et al 2015 which is in line with our findings for the sb sample furthermore we observed elevated inductions after specific weathering types most findings stem from uv c t2 followed by uv a baq t4 uv a b t3 and the dark control t1 fig s5 based on the literature it is not really surprising that uv light enhanced the plastics toxicity however it is noteworthy that minor plastic eqs already induced concerning effects i e either less than 668 mg and 222 mg in the microtox and arec32 assay or 111 mg in the antagonistic assays to give an example 11 7 mg well 1 t4 of ldpe r eqs affected 20 of the bacteria in the microtox assay while the same effect was achieved with 0 64 µg well 1 of 3 5 dichlorophenol as positive control this corresponds to 4 26 mg of 3 5 dichlorophenol l 1 which is harmful to aquatic life norman network 2021 hence we believe that this assessment of leachable plastic chemicals is somewhat mirroring the current ongoing process in the environment considering the million tons of plastics annually polluting the aquatic systems lebreton et al 2017 since the chemical release can be related to the uv intensity andrady et al 1998 temperature yang et al 2011 and or surface area of the material muncke et al 2020 in contact with a specific type of solvent szczepańska et al 2016 detectable components and toxicological findings may vary depending on the extraction method used our experiments represent mild exposure scenarios due to the uv intensity table s2 and table s3 in si and short contact time with a soft medium i e 24 h in water because the atmospheric uv irradiation led to elevated temperatures t2 45 2 and t3 40 7 c after which we noticed yellowed samples and a strong synthetic smell the toxicities might be closely linked to these temperatures table s5 tsochatzis et al 2020 depicted that temperature i e 20 40 and 60 c over a time period of 10 days had a substantial effect on the release of two compounds typically found in food contact materials likewise yang et al 2011 found more detectable estrogenic activities for samples following moist heat treatments e g via autoclave process in the present study both the temperature and uv light have to be considered as two influencing factors on the chemical migration however bandow et al 2017 tested the release rates of in organic compounds of recycled plastic pellets or disks and has shown that photo oxidation has a greater influence on chemical release than thermo oxidative conditions i e a high temperature cai et al 2018 demonstrated in a similar methodological design that pellets weathered under atmospheric conditions were more prone to degradation than in aqueous medium the same is true for our weathering scenarios we observed mitigated toxicological activities for t4 uv a baq in comparison to t2 uv c fig s5 this might be attributed to the water diffusing uv light through absorption and reflection uv c irradiation serving as a worst case scenario on the other hand probably leads to toxic transformation products due to the high energetic radiation since previous studies deliberately increased the plastics surface area for leaching purposes bejgarn et al 2015 rummel et al 2019 we statistically analyzed whether the surface area table s1 correlates with the observed toxicities our data do not support that a greater surface area leads to a higher toxicity but rather that the effects depend on leachable toxicants present in individual plastic samples admittedly comparing pellets and milled fragments could be more conclusive comp ye et al 2020 4 5 diversity of chemical components this study aimed to elucidate whether plastic chemicals are increasingly released after uv weathering and whether these chemicals are interlinked with the observed toxicities due to weathering we observed increased component counts for almost every sample however the sb leached fewer chemicals after each uv treatment whereas the ldpe r released fewer chemicals solely after atmospheric weathering fig 5 table s9 most of these chemicals are low molecular fragments exemplified in fig s6 for pvc a which are formed to a higher extent due to degradation as a result the number and amount of components generally cluster after the uv treatments table s9 this is in line with the toxicological findings fig s5 e g uv c as a worst case scenario revealed most positive findings in view of the chemicals we cannot narrow down the main driver for the toxicities as this would be only feasible via effect directed analysis although we did not majorly focus on chemical identification future studies should address this in order to determine yet unknown substances responsible for adverse effects our chemical data are generally in accordance with other studies considering analytical differences using lc orbitrap ms gewert et al 2018 detected similarly low counts for pp ps and pe pellets while pet pellets gewert et al 2018 as well as bottles wagner et al 2013 leached higher chemical counts bradley and coulier 2007 as well as qian et al 2018 detected more chemicals for pp than in our study pp h 41 t1 table s9 however they deployed either a wide variety of techniques in order to detect semi volatile polar and or non volatile substances bradley coulier 2007 or a large selection of plastics 35 pp products in qian et al 2018 interestingly bradley coulier 2007 ascribed the majority of detected chemicals in the examined high commodity plastics to impurities and breakdown products as for pvc and bio associated plastics zimmermann et al 2019 obtained low to high chemical counts for extracts from pvc products analyzed with gc qtof ms zimmermann et al 2020 further employed an analytical system comparable to our study and observed between 880 and 20 965 chemicals for pla pbs pbat and starch based materials a detailed identification and classification of the plastic associated chemicals was beyond the scope of our study we still identified some of the detected components not displayed with the attribute tentative confident or confirmed these included stabilizers e g benzophenone benzothiazoles benzotriazoles plasticizers e g n butylbenzenesulfonamide acetyltributylcitrate organophosphorus compounds e g dibutyl and tributyl phosphates antioxidants e g irganox 1098 benzoquinone fenozan different benzoic acids and 1 3 diphenylguanidine most of these compounds occurred almost after every treatment while a small fraction was specific to one treatment we further identified many degradants especially for the biodegradable plastics the majority of detected compounds still remained unknown although this might be attributed to the depth of the chemical analysis in the main the chemical analysis demonstrated that plastics comprise low and high chemical contents and that chemicals are increasingly released due to initiating degradation processes for example by uv light and hydrolysis overall this hampers a proper risk assessment for aquatic organisms because new degradation products are continuously formed even if degradants would not be an issue there are many registered chemicals publicly not disclosed i e over 50 000 chemicals as analyzed by wang et al 2020 this lack of transparency applies likewise for chemicals used in plastics and needs to be improved urgently groh et al 2019 however this also puts the application of diverse chemicals into question as toxicologically rather less harmful polymeric formulas already exist 5 conclusions our results demonstrate that differently formulated plastics include chemicals inducing baseline toxicity oxidative stress and antagonistic activities some plastics affected several in vitro endpoints whereas others caused little to no effects the toxicities varied even for the same polymer type as a result we cannot attribute a toxicological profile to a specific polymer type because activities depended on the customized chemical composition of each plastic moreover we demonstrate that uv irradiation exacerbated the plastics toxicities even for plastics initially evaluated as toxicologically harmless the atmospheric scenario with uv c irradiation had the strongest impact followed by aquatic weathering uv a baq the atmospheric uv a b and the dark control dc as reference a high number of chemical components was detected in the aqueous leachates by non target analysis whether they were toxic or not every tested plastic sample released chemicals such were increasingly observed due to uv irradiation whereas most chemicals were detected after uv a baq in general we exemplified the chemical heterogeneity in polymeric formulations e g for plastic pellets as well as products and showed that uv light facilitates the chemical release it is noteworthy that we only assessed some un specific mediated effects with bacterial human and yeast cells but chemicals in plastics may affect health in ways that are currently not yet fully understood in order to prevent the exposure to plastic associated chemicals mitigation of release of chemicals should be addressed during product development but the application of chemicals could be generally reduced to a minimum on a regulatory level the testing of singular compounds is of specific concern since our chemical data point to mixture effects we believe that the evaluation of plastic eluates could be another important focal point

16974,this study explores the degradation kinetics and mechanisms of n chloro α amino acids and the changes in the formation potential of nitrogenous disinfection byproducts n dbps upon uv254 irradiation uv254 irradiation significantly accelerated the degradation of all the tested n chloro α amino acids compared to those in the dark both direct photolysis induced cleavage of the n cl bonds and radical oxidation e g cl and cl2 involved reactions that contributed to their enhanced degradation the fluence based photolysis rate constants of the n chloro α amino acids varied in the range of 1 06 5 47 10 3 cm2 mj 1 at ph 6 0 and 0 74 2 79 10 3 cm2 mj 1 at ph 8 0 the apparent quantum yields φapp of the majority of the n chloro α amino acids were in the range of 0 41 0 95 at ph 6 0 and 0 22 0 79 at ph 8 0 except n chloroaspartic acid n chlorohistidine and n chloroalanine uv254 irradiation significantly enhanced the formation of trichloronitromethane tcnm from the tested n chloro α amino acids after post chlorination but exhibited various effects on the formation of dichloroacetonitrile dcan a longer uv254 irradiation time generated more tcnm and a lower ph produced more dcan from the n chloro α amino acids the degradation pathways of n chlorotyrosine as a representative n chloro α amino acid are proposed and the β scission and 1 2 h shift pathways led to the formation of different precursors of tcnm and dcan the results of this study improve our understanding of the fate of n chloro α amino acids under uv254 irradiation and post chlorination graphic abstract image graphical

reported n chloro α amino acids can cause protein dna cross links kulcharyk et al 2001 produce chromosomal abnormalities and inhibit dna repair pero et al 1996 the stabilities of the n chloro α amino acids were quite variable with half lives in the dark at room temperature ranging from 2 min to more than 96 h stanbro et al 1979 hand et al 1983 armesto et al 1993 how et al 2016 n chloroglycine was the most stable n chloro α amino acid with a half life of over 96 h n chloroproline n chloroaspartic acid n chlorgultamine and n chloroasparagine had the fastest degradation rates with half lives of less than 15 min while the half lives for the other n chloro α amino acids were in the range of 35 min to 4 5 h how et al 2016 the degradation of n chlor α amino acids led to the formation of hazardous intermediates and byproducts such as imines aldehydes carbonyls ammonia and chloride ions stanbro et al 1979 hand et al 1983 simon et al 2019 for example formaldehyde was observed from the decomposition of n chloroglycine hand et al 1983 n chloroalanine decomposition led to the formation of acetaldehyde or pyruvic ion simon et al 2019 n monochlorovaline degraded into isobutyraldehyde and n dichlorovaline degraded into isobutyronitrile and n chloroisobutyraldimine how et al 2017 some of these intermediates can further react with free chlorine to generate n dbps therefore it is essential to understand the fate of n chloro α amino acids in water treatment processes in water treatment uv irradiation is often used along with chlorination li et al 2017 guo et al 2017 cheng et al 2018 liu et al 2020 uv irradiation is popularly used for primary disinfection and chlorine is supplemented as a secondary disinfectant to maintain the residual free chlorine in the distribution system pre chlorination is also sometimes applied for algae removal and taste and odor control in the beginning of water treatment chains in addition uv irradiation and chlorination have recently been used together as an advanced oxidation process and the generated hydroxyl and chlorine radicals effectively eliminated micropollutants watts et al 2007 lei et al 2019 under these conditions the generated n chloro α amino acids were exposed to uv irradiation the n cl bonds in the n chloro α amino acids generally have a uv absorbance in the range of 250 280 nm how et al 2016 overlapping with a low pressure uv emission wavelength of 254 nm uv254 thus the photolysis of n chloro α amino acids may lead to the breakage of the n cl bonds eq 1 and eq 2 this will change their stability and subsequent n dbp formation a few previous studies have reported that the n cl cleavage of n chloroglycine n chloroarginine and n chlorohistidine under uv254 photolysis resulted in the formation of ammonia or cyanogen chloride weng and blatchley 2013 a recent study reported that n cl bond in n chloroatenolol was cleaved by uv254 irradiation to form amines and ammonia ra et al 2019 furthermore the cleavage of the n cl band can produce a series of radicals e g cl ho and cl2 via complex chain reactions and enhance pollutant elimination sun et al 2019 yin et al 2020 thus the n chloro α amino acids possibly degrade through both direct uv254 induced photolysis and indirect radical involved reactions until now the kinetics and mechanisms of n chloro α amino acid photolysis under uv254 irradiation have not been well investigated 1 r n h 2 h o c l r n h c l h 2 o 2 r h n c l h v r h n c l as the precursors of n dbps the photodegradation of n chloro α amino acids can affect n dbp formation during

free chlorine weng et al 2012 deng et al 2014 afifi and blatchley 2016 cyanogen chloride formation was also shown to be promoted during uv254 irradiation of chlorinated arginine and histidine weng and blatchley 2013 recent studies have reported that uv254 irradiation enhanced the formation potentials of tcnm from phenolic and amine containing compounds zhang et al 2019 zhou et al 2020 how the uv254 irradiation of n chloro α amino acids affects the n dbp precursors requires further investigation the objectives of this study are to understand the degradation kinetics and mechanisms of n chloro α amino acids under uv254 irradiation and the n dbp formation during subsequent post chlorination twenty α amino acids were tested and sixteen n chloro α amino acids were generated and tracked first the degradation kinetics of the n chloro α amino acids under uv254 irradiation were investigated and compared with that in the dark the apparent quantum yields of n chloro α amino acids were obtained second the formation potential of n dbps in term of trichloronitromethane tcnm and dichloroacetonitrile dcan generated from n chloro α amino acids with and without uv254 irradiation was investigated third the degradation pathways of n chloro α amino acids using n chlorotyrosine as a representative were proposed 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents suppliers and purities of the twenty studied α amino acids are described in table s1 in the supporting information si dcan 2000 µg ml 1 in acetone tcnm 2000 µg ml 1 in acetone 1 2 dibromopropane 97 and methyl tert butyl ether mtbe 99 9 were purchased from sigma aldrich usa diethyl p phenylene diamine dpd and monochlor f reagent were purchased from the hach co usa a stock solution of free chlorine was prepared by diluting 5 sodium hypochlorite sigma aldrich usa in ultrapure water to 1000 mg l 1 as cl2 the n chloro α amino acids were prepared in amber glass bottles under continuous stirring on a magnetic stir plate at room temperature each α amino acid solution 0 60 or 0 10 mm was buffered at ph 6 0 or 8 0 with 10 0 mm phosphate buffer a certain amount of free chlorine 0 12 or 0 09 mm was spiked into the α amino acid solution to achieve a free chlorine to α amino acid molar ratio of 0 2 1 or 0 9 1 the solutions were mixed for 4 min except for asparagine 30 min mixing time after the preparation of the n chloro α amino acids the residual free chorine in the solution was undetectable using a chlorine analyzer hach dr 2800 by a dpd free chlorine reagent detection limit 0 02 mg l 1 additionally nh2cl and nhcl2 were analyzed on a membrane introduction mass spectrometry hpr40 hiden germany but the concentration of either nh2cl or nhcl2 was below the detection limit 0 1 mg l 1 for each the concentration of the total chlorine were determined by the same chlorine analyzer using the monof reagent and the full conversion from free chlorine to n chloro α amino acids was confirmed the prepared n chloro α amino acid solutions were used immediately for the uv254 irradiation tests 2 2 experimental procedures the uv254 irradiation setup is shown in figure s1 the uv254 irradiation tests were performed using a quasi collimated beam apparatus with two 10 w low pressure mercury lamps gph 212t5l 4 10 w heraeus the average uv254 fluence rate is entering the solution was determined to be 0 30 mw cm 2 by using iodide iodate chemical actinometry bolton et al 2003 detailed information is provided in text s1 in the si a cylindrical dish containing 210 ml of individual n chloro α amino acid solutions were placed directly under the beam to investigate the degradation kinetics the n chloro α amino acid solution was prepared at a molar ratio of free chlorine with α amino acids of 0 2 1 i e free chlorine 0 12 mm and α amino acids 0 60 mm to minimize the hydrolysis of the n chloro α amino acids li et al 2011 each n chloro α amino acid solution was exposed under uv254 irradiation for pre determined time intervals 1 60 min and then the samples were analyzed for residual n chloro α amino acids the control experiments were conducted in the same manner but without the uv254 irradiation for the slowly degraded n chloro α amino acids i e n chloroglycine and n chloroalanine the dark incubation time was extended to three days n chloroglycine was chosen as a representative compound to evaluate the ph effects with phs varying from 4 5 to 8 0 buffered with a 10 mm phosphate buffer in some of the tests acetate 12 0 mm was added to quench the radicals and explore the effect of direct photolysis on the degradation rates of n chloroglycine under uv254 irradiation in the n dbp formation experiments the n chloro α amino acid solutions were prepared at a molar ratio of free chlorine with the α amino acids of 0 9 1 i e 0 09 mm of free chlorine and 0 10 mm of α amino acids to minimize the formation of n dbps from the residual α amino acids during the post chlorination the experimental procedures were conducted following the same procedures as described above after uv254 irradiation for 20 to 40 min 1 0 mm free chlorine was replenished in the solutions and incubated for 24 h for post chlorination after post chlorination the concentration of residual free chlorine was determined and the stoichiometric amount of ascorbic acid was added to quench the residual chlorine then the solutions were extracted using mtbe and determined for the concentrations of dcan and tcnm all of the above experiments were conducted in duplicate or triplicate to identify the transformation products n chlorotyrosine was selected as a representative n chloro α amino acid n chlorotyrosine was prepared by mixing free chlorine 1 8 mm and tyrosine 2 0 mm at ph 6 0 the n chlorotyrosine solution was subjected to uv254 exposure for 20 min and followed by a 6 h post chlorination with the addition of 20 mm of free chlorine the control tests were conducted by incubating the n chlorotyrosine solutions in the dark for 20 min followed by post chlorination for 6 h samples were collected periodically quenched with ascorbic acid and then extracted with mtbe for identification of the transformation products 2 3 analytical methods the concentrations of the n chloro α amino acids except n chlorophenylalanine and n chlorotyrosine were determined using an uv vis spectrophotometer shimadzu uv 2700 by measuring the absorbance at 254 nm figure s2a li et al 2017 as phenylalanine and tyrosine had uv absorbances both at 254 nm figure s2c they were quantified using the dpd

degradation of the n chloro α amino acids under uv254 irradiation 3 1 1 uv absorption spectra and molar absorptivity of the n chloro α amino acids among the 20 investigated α amino acids sixteen n chloro α amino acids were able to be prepared and used in this study the four amino acids that were not able to be examined included cysteine methionine tryptophan and proline due to the unsuccessful preparation or low stability of their corresponding n chloro α amino acids cysteine methionine and tryptophan cannot form stable n chloro α amino acids upon reaction with free chlorine n chloroproline was not stable and exhibited very fast hydrolysis in the dark 1 58 min 1 at ph 6 0 and was not able to be tracked at the testing time scales the uv absorption characteristics of the sixteen n chloro α amino acids are illustrated in figure s2b the spectra of n chloroglycine as a representative is presented in fig 1 glycine had no absorbance at wavelengths greater than 250 nm the absorption spectra of n chloroglycine peaked at 250 260 nm due to the characterized absorbance of the n cl bonds the other investigated n chloro α amino acids also had peak absorbances from 250 to 280 nm figure s2b the molar absorptivities at 254 nm ε254 of the n chloro α amino acids were calculated text s2 and summarized in table 1 it should be noted that the sixteen tested α amino acids had no absorbance over 250 nm except phenylalanine and tyrosine figure s2 the ε254 for n chlorophenylalanine and n chlorotyrosine were thus obtained after subtracting the absorbance of the remaining phenylalanine and tyrosine in the solutions text s2 the ε254 of the n chloro α amino acids were in the range of 300 to 458 m 1cm 1 at ph 6 0 and 8 0 n chlorotyrosine had the highest absorptivity of 458 m 1cm 1 at ph 6 0 and 442 m 1cm 1 at ph 8 0 and n chlorolysine had the lowest absorptivity 300 m 1cm 1 at ph 6 0 and 325 m 1cm 1 at ph 8 0 these results indicated that the n chloro α amino acids are strong uv absorbers and can undergo direct photolysis under uv254 irradiation 3 1 2 degradation kinetics of the n chloro α amino acids under uv254 irradiation and in the dark the degradation of the sixteen n chloro α amino acids with and without uv254 irradiation was tracked the time evolution of the spectra of n chloroglycine is shown in fig 1 as an example the degradation of n chloro α amino acids followed pseudo first order kinetics with five representatives as shown in fig 2 a as shown in fig 2b the uv254 irradiation obviously enhanced the degradation rates of all the 16 tested n chloro α amino acids compared to their self degradation in the dark without uv254 irradiation without uv254 irradiation the degradation rates of the 16 n chloro α amino acids ranged 1 1 10 3 s 1 n chloroaspartic acid to 2 9 10 5 s 1 n chloroglycine at ph 6 0 in contrast at ph 8 0 figure s3b their dark degradation rates reduced to some extent ranging from 4 9 10 4 s 1 n chloroasparagine to 3 0 10 6 s 1 n chloroglycine in comparison to dark incubation all of the n chloro α amino acids showed higher degradation rate constants under uv254 irradiation k obs uv which were 1 5 18 2 times of those in the dark k obs dark at ph 6 0 fig 2b and 1 1 139 0 times at ph 8 0 figure s3 for example the degradation rate constant of n chloroglycine 5 29 10 4 s 1 was 18 fold faster than that in the dark 0 29 10 4 s 1 at ph 6 0 additionally n chloroglycine prepared using different chlorine and glycine molar ratios 0 2 1 0 5 1 and 0 9 1 exhibited similar degradation kinetics under the uv254 irradiation figure s4 this suggested the effects of the molar ratio of chlorine and α amino acids on the photodegradation of n chloro α amino acids could be ignored the fluence based degradation rate constants and the half life times of the n chloro α amino acids under the uv254 irradiation were calculated details in text s3 and are summarized in table 1 among the tested n chloro α amino acids n chloroaspartic acid had the highest fluence based rate constants and n chlorolysine had the lowest fluence based rate constants at ph 6 0 which were 5 47 10 3 and 1 06 10 3 cm2 mj 1 respectively the half life times of the tested n chloro α amino acids under uv254 irradiation fell in the range of 6 94 35 77 min at ph 6 0 and 13 61 51 34 min at ph 8 0 the apparent quantum yields φapp of the n chloro α amino acids were calculated based on eq 3 and the detailed calculation is provided in text s3 3 φ a p p k photolysis q e 2 303 e 0 i ε 254 k obs uv k obs dark q e 2 303 e 0 i ε 254 where k photolysis is the rate

amino acids were in the range of 0 41 0 95 at ph 6 0 and 0 22 0 79 at ph 8 0 however φapp of n chloroaspartic acid n chlorohistidine and n chloroalanine at ph 6 0 exceeded 1 0 implying that chain reactions of radicals may have occurred as discussed in a later section as φapp counted both the direct photolysis and radical oxidation and the innate quantum yields φinn of the n chloro α amino acids were estimated by spiking acetate as a radical scavenger acetate is recalcitrant upon uv254 irradiation and unreactive with n chloro α amino acids acetate has been reported to be reactive towards ho 1 108 m 1s 1 and cl 3 5 107 m 1s 1 yin et al 2020 as such the addition of acetate 100 fold molar excess to α amino acids could distinguish the direct photolysis and radical involved reactions for n chloroaspartic acid n chlorohistidine and n chloroalanine n chloroglycine and n chlorotyrosine were also included for comparison as shown in figure s5 the k obs uv of the five tested n chloro α amino acids in the presence of acetate at ph 6 0 decreased by 20 7 84 5 the φinn of n chloroaspartic acid n chlorohistidine n chloroalanine n chloroglycine and n chlorotyrosine were all lower than φapp which were estimated to be 0 98 0 18 0 75 0 69 and 0 28 respectively these results indicated that the radical involved reactions had some contribution to the degradation of the n chloro α amino acids under uv254 irradiation 3 1 3 the identification of radicals in the uv254 irradiation of the n chloro α amino acids the cleavage of n cl bonds in the n chloro α amino acids upon uv254 irradiation can produce chlorine radicals cl eq 2 dichlorine radicals cl2 and hydroxyl radicals ho may also form due to the cl reactions with cl eq 4 and h2o eqs 5 6 lei et al 2019 lei et al 2021 4 c

examined using the probe compounds e g nitrobenzene benzoic acid and carbamazepine text s4 both cl and cl2 were detected but ho was not detectable at ph 6 0 due to a relatively high level of chloride presented in the solution nearly 0 3 mm the cl readily reacted with chloride eq 4 rather than being converted to ho via eqs 5 and 6 the levels of cl were in the range of approximately 10 16 to 10 15 m and those of cl2 were in the range of approximately 10 15 to 10 14 m under the experimental conditions figure s6 laser flash photolysis experiments were also conducted to obtain direct evidence of the presence of the radicals three n chloro α amino acids named n chloroglycine n chlorohistidine and n chloroaspartic acid were irradiated using a 266 nm laser and the corresponding transient spectra were tracked text s5 maximum absorption bands centered at 340 nm were observed for the three compounds tested figure s7 which may be assigned to cl2 ε340 8800 m 1cm 1 lei et al 2019 the distinct absorption spectra of cl at 320 nm was not observed as the testing the n chloro α amino acids solutions contained 5 mm cl once generated the cl reacted with the cl to rapidly form cl2 eq 4 3 1 4 ph dependence of the photolysis of the n chloro α amino acids the fluence based photodegradation rate constants of n chloro α amino acids at ph 8 0 ranged from 0 74 10 3 to 2 79 10 3cm2 mj 1 which were generally lower than those at ph 6 0 except for n chloroleucine and n chloroasparagine being comparable at both phs the molar absorptivity of the n chloro α amino acids was similar at ph 6 0 and ph 8 0 table 1 in contrast φapp of the n chloro α amino acids at ph 8 0 0 04 0 79 were between 14 7 and 93 1 lower than those at ph 6 0 table 1 these results highlighted that the photolysis of the n chloro α amino acids was ph dependent n chloroglycine was selected as a representative compound to deeply investigate the effects of ph ranging from 4 5 to 8 0 as shown in figure s8 the photo degradation of n chloroglycine was fastest at ph 4 5 8 0 10 4 s 1 then slowed down to 5 3 10 4 s 1 at ph 6 0 followed by 4 7 10 4 s 1 at ph 7 0 and 4 5 10 4 s 1 at ph 8 0 however the dark degradation rates of the n chloroglycine at the investigated phs were lower than 2 10 5 s 1 suggesting that ph primarily affected the photo involved processes rather than the dark hydrolysis of n chloroglycine to distinguish the ph effects on direct photolysis or the radical reactions acetate 12 mm was added into the solution to quench cl and stop the secondary radical reactions with the presence of acetate the k obs of n chloroglycine gradually decreased from 5 3 10 4 s 1 at ph 4 5 and to 2 8 10 4 s 1 at ph 8 0 indicating ph obviously affected direct photolysis although the pk a value of glycine was 9 58 table 1 the presence of the strong electron withdrawing chlorine in the n chloroglycine greatly reduced the pk a value of the nhcl zhao et al 2020 based on the quantum chemical computations the pk a of n chloroglycine was estimated to be 4 5 text s6 when the ph was near to its pk a value pk a 4 5 n chloroglycine tended to transform to nhcl by protonation in contrast when the ph values were higher than its pk a values the unprotonated nhcl was dominant according to the experimental results and the calculated pk a of n chloroglycine it was concluded that the ph affected the speciation of n chloroglycine and the protonated nhcl may have higher photosensitivity than the unprotonated nhcl 3 2 photolysis of the n chloro α amino acids affected the formation potential of the tcnm and dcan n chloro α amino acids are known to be n dbp precursors tcnm and dcan formation from n chloro α amino acids followed by post chlorination 1 0 mm chlorine and 24 h incubation was evaluated at ph 6 0 and 8 0 with and without uv254 irradiation treatment it should be noted that the concentrations of tcnm and dcan were undetectable during uv254 irradiation alone the tcnm and dcan formation potentials after 24 h post chlorination are presented in fig 3 after uv254 irradiation less than 0 02 mm of ammonia formed in the solution when 1 0 mm of free chlorine was supplemented in post chlorination the ammonia entirely converted into nitrogen via breakpoint chlorination the concentrations of inorganic chloramine were undetectable ten n chloro α amino acids produced tcnm under uv254 irradiation followed by post chlorination at ph 6 0 whereas dark incubation barely generated detectable tcnm except for n chloroserine n chlorothreonine and n chloroleucine with concentrations of 0 5 2 5 and 2 8 μg l 1 respectively fig 3a clearly uv254 irradiation of n chloro α amino acids significantly enhanced tcnm formation during post chlorination for example the tcnm yields of n chlorothreonine increased by 296 from 2 8 to 11 1 μg l 1 after 20 min uv254 irradiation followed by post chlorination at ph 6 0 additionally n chlorotyrosine and n chloroglycine produced 1 1 and 5 0 μg l 1 of tcnm in the 20 min uv254 irradiation followed by post chlorination at ph 6 0 however no tcnm was observed from n chlorotyrosine and n chloroglycine after 20 min of dark incubation with post chlorination an increase in the tcnm formation potential after uv254 irradiation was also observed at ph 8 0 figure s9a furthermore increasing the uv254 irradiation time tended to increase the tcnm yields at both ph 6 0 fig 4 a and ph 8 0 figure s10a when the uv254 irradiation time increased from 5 to 40 min corresponding to the uv254 dose increasing from 91 2 to 729 6 mj cm 2 the tcnm yields of n chlorotyrosine increased from 0 2 to 1 8 μg l 1 at ph 6 0 and increased from 0 3 to 1 9 μg l 1 at ph 8 0 similarly the tcnm yields of n chloroglycine increased by 361 from 1 8 to 8 3 μg l 1 at ph 6 0 and increased by 453 from 1 5 to 8 3 μg l 1 at ph 8 0 these results also suggest that the tcnm formation from the n chloro α amino acids exhibited limited ph dependence in the uv254 irradiation system in contrast the uv254 irradiation exhibited varied effects on the formation of dcan during post chlorination fig 3b at ph 6 0 most of the n chloro α amino acids formed dcan regardless of uv254 irradiation application or not without the uv254 irradiation the dcan yields of n chloroarginine n chloroglutamic acid n chloroglutamine and n chlorolysine were 281 3 11 5 11 9 and 7 9 μg l 1 respectively after 20 min of uv254 irradiation the yields of dcan from these compounds increased by 91 0 13 0 30 8 and 67 6 respectively for the other n chloro α amino acids e g n chloroaspartic acid n chlorohistidine n chloroasparagine and n chlorotyrosine the changes in the dcan yields were less than 5 additionally prolonging the uv254 irradiation time from 5 to 40 min had no significant impacts on dcan formation for n chlorotyrosine n chlorothreonine n chlorolysine n chloroglycine and n chloroalanine at ph 6 0 fig 4b however ph significantly affected the dcan yields of the tested n chloro α amino acids the levels of dcan at ph 8 0 fig s9b were much lower than those at ph 6 0 fig 3b for example the dcan formation potential from n chlorotyrosine by uv254 irradiation at ph 6 0 248 0 μg l 1 was approximately 15 fold higher than that at ph 8 0 15 9 μg l 1 the dcan formation potential after photolysis of n chloroasparagine was 68 fold higher at ph 6 0 263 0 μg l 1 than that at ph 8 0 3 8 μg l 1 these results suggested that the dcan formation potentials from n chloro α amino acids during uv254 irradiation exhibited strong ph dependence and a lower ph condition tended to produce more dcan as discussed in section 3 1 ph affected the photo degradation rates of n chloro α amino acids the k obs uv at ph 6 0 were essentially higher than that at ph 8 0 furthermore ph also altered the species and roles of reactive radicals more cl tended to be consumed by ho at ph 8 0 compared to that at ph 6 0 as a result less dcan precursors were formed from the photodegradation of n chloro α amino acid at ph 8 0 than that of at ph 6 0 in addition to the tcnm and dcan the formations of regular organic halogenated by products were also measured and the trichloromethane tcm chloral hydrate ch and dichloroacetaldehyde dcal of the n chloro α amino acids were observed figure s11 among the 16 investigated n chloro α amino acids the n chloroaspartic acid produced the highest amount of tcm ch and dcal in the uv254 irradiation followed by post chlorination process which may have been attributed to its fastest uv254 induced degradation rate most of investigated n chloro α amino acids generated a small amount of tcm 10 μg l 1 except for n chloroaspartic acid and n chlorotyrosine different n chloro α amino acids exhibited different dbp formation potentials due to their distinct molecular structures and photodegradation kinetics the impacts of the uv254 irradiation were also varied the difference trends in the dbp formation potential suggested that the uv254 irradiation exerted different impacts on the precursors of tcnm and dcan thus understanding the degradation pathways of n chloro α amino acids and the generation of n dbp precursors are necessary 3 3 intermediates and degradation pathways of n chlorotyrosine as a representative n chloro amino acid to obtain insights into the intermediates and the degradation pathways of n chloro α amino acids under uv254 irradiation and during post chlorination n chlorotyrosine was chosen as a representative compound because it generated a great amount of both tcnm and dcan during post chlorination fig 3 four primary transformation products were observed during uv254 irradiation of n chlorotyrosine at ph 6 0 including tp136 c8h8o2 tp133 c8h7no tp167 c8h6clno and tp122 c7h6o2 specifically tp136 and tp122 were identified as 2 4 hydroxyphenyl acetaldehyde and 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde respectively tp133 was identified as 2 4 hydroxyphenyl acetonitrile and tp167 was a monochlorinated product of tp133 the proposed structures ion chromatograms and extracted ion mass ms spectra of these intermediates are provided in table s2 and figure s12 the time dependent evolution of these intermediates are illustrated in fig 5 a tp136 was predominant among these intermediates the highest signal of tp136 reached or was near the maximum yields in the first sampling point at 5 min and remained stable during the 20 min uv254 exposure period tp133 and tp167 were also generated quickly within 5 min of uv254 irradiation and their yields decreased with an extension of uv254 irradiation time from 5 min to 20 min tp122 was formed slowly and the intensity of tp122 was relatively lower than the other three intermediates notably tp136 was abundant under the uv254 irradiation fig 5a whereas it did not form in the dark fig 5b tp133 tp167 and tp122 were formed during the uv254 irradiation whereas these intermediates were not observed in the without uv254 irradiation condition as shown in fig 5 ammonium n was observed during the degradation of n chlorotyrosine with uv254 irradiation figure s13 additionally formic acid approximately 0 3 mm and acetic acid approximately 0 04 mm were also formed via decarboxylation figure s14 these intermediates confirmed the enhanced degradation of n chlorotyrosine under the uv254 irradiation the predominant intermediate tp136 tended to the main tcnm precursors in the uv254 irradiation system since the negligible tcnm formed under the without uv254 irradiation condition in the subsequent post chlorination the aldehyde product tp136 formed during the uv254 irradiation decreased dramatically fig 5a in contrast the abundance of the nitrile product tp167 increased quickly and achieved the maximum after 3 min of post chlorination this was then followed by a decreasing trend other products including chlorinated 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde tp156 c8h9clo chlorinated phenol tp128 c6h5clo and dcan tp 109 c2hcl2n were observed but with lower intensities than tp167 fig 5b shows that during the post chlorination without uv254 treatment the nitrile product tp167 was also the primary intermediate and formed quickly when free chlorine was supplemented the maximum intensity of tp167 in the dark incubation was four times higher than that after uv254 irradiation another nitrile product tp133 became the highest after 50 min post chlorination without the uv254 irradiation aldehyde products tp122 and tp156 and chlorinated phenol tp128 were also observed in post chlorination without the uv254 irradiation and their intensities were generally comparable with those with the uv254 irradiation scheme 1 proposes the transformation pathways of n chlorotyrosine during uv254 irradiation and post chlorination initially uv254 irradiation led to the cleavage of the n cl bond in n chlorotyrosine generating cl and aminyl radicals cl tended to react with intermediates or was converted to cl2 and aminyl radicals were in equilibrium with the aminyl radical cations afterward c centered radicals were formed primarily via two pathways the 1 2 h shift and β scission following the 1 2 h shift pathway the aminyl radicals were converted into α carbon centered radicals accompanied with decarboxylation the neighboring amino group was transformed into an imine group to form 4 2 iminoethyl phenol subsequently r1 pathway ra et al 2019 then the 4 2 iminoethyl phenol underwent deamination and hydrolysis yielding 2 4 hydroxyphenyl acetaldehyde tp136 and releasing ammonium n in addition the imine moiety was converted to chlorinated imine by the attack of cl and cl2 which were further transformed to 2 4 hydroxyphenyl acetonitrile tp133 via de chlorination upon uv254 irradiation following the r2 pathway additionally inorganic monochloramine nh2cl may have been generated from the released ammonium n and trace hocl in equilibrium with the n chloro α amino acids the reaction between nh2cl and the aldehyde product tp136 could also form tp133 r3 pathway then tp167 was formed through the chlorination of tp133 by either hocl or chlorine radicals cl and cl2 these nitrile products e g tp167 and tp133 could further transform to dcan during post chlorination during the β scission pathway the aminyl radicals produced β c centered radicals and 2 iminoacetic acid r4 chlorine radicals cl and cl2 attacked some imines and chlorinated imines generated during the uv254 irradiation r5 subsequently chlorinated imines could be oxidized to a nitro group and thus formed tcnm during post chlorination r6 additionally the hydrolysis of β c centered radicals formed 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde tp122 the aldehyde intermediates tp136 and tp122 tended to convert to chlorinated imines via chloramination r7 leading to the formation of chlorinated phenolic products tp128 and tp156 and chlorinated imines r8 the formed chlorinated imines could also be oxidized to tcnm during post chlorination yang et al 2012 based on the proposed mechanisms the 1 2 h shift photodegradation pathway of n chlorotyrosine generated dcan precursors however both the β scission and 1 2 h shift pathway initiated the generation of the tcnm precursors essentially uv254 photolysis and the participation of reactive chlorine radicals greatly contributed to the formation of the tcnm precursors 4 conclusions uv254 irradiation could significantly enhance the n chloro α amino acids degradation via the uv254 induced cleavage of n cl bonds and radical oxidation the degradation rate constants and apparent quantum yields φapp of the n chloro α amino acids were quite variable with the fluence based rate constant ranging from 1 06 10 3 to 5 47 10 3 cm2 mj 1 at ph 6 0 and φapp varying from 0 41 1 23 at ph 6 0 the n chloro α amino acids had lower degradation rates at ph 8 0 than ph 6 0 the uv254 irradiation exhibited different effects on the formation potentials of tcnm and dcan the tcnm formation potential was greatly enhanced in the tested n chloro α amino acids compared to that without uv254 irradiation but the dcan formation potential varied the uv254 induced degradation of the n chloro α amino acids generated aldehydes and nitriles some of which may persist in treated water for days or continue to degrade into dbps during post chlorination when the n chloro α amino acids containing waters were exposed to uv254 treatment the generation of n dbp precursors should be a concern shortening the uv254 irradiation time could inhibit the formation of the tcnm precursors in addition the adjustment of the ph to an alkaline condition could benefit a reduction in the formation of the dcan precursors some pretreatment methods such as pre ozonation are also recommended to remove α amino acids and control the n dbps overall the kinetic and mechanistic information obtained from this study can be useful for understanding the fate of n chloro α amino acids upon uv254 irradiation in water and wastewater treatment declaration of competing interest the authors

16974,this study explores the degradation kinetics and mechanisms of n chloro α amino acids and the changes in the formation potential of nitrogenous disinfection byproducts n dbps upon uv254 irradiation uv254 irradiation significantly accelerated the degradation of all the tested n chloro α amino acids compared to those in the dark both direct photolysis induced cleavage of the n cl bonds and radical oxidation e g cl and cl2 involved reactions that contributed to their enhanced degradation the fluence based photolysis rate constants of the n chloro α amino acids varied in the range of 1 06 5 47 10 3 cm2 mj 1 at ph 6 0 and 0 74 2 79 10 3 cm2 mj 1 at ph 8 0 the apparent quantum yields φapp of the majority of the n chloro α amino acids were in the range of 0 41 0 95 at ph 6 0 and 0 22 0 79 at ph 8 0 except n chloroaspartic acid n chlorohistidine and n chloroalanine uv254 irradiation significantly enhanced the formation of trichloronitromethane tcnm from the tested n chloro α amino acids after post chlorination but exhibited various effects on the formation of dichloroacetonitrile dcan a longer uv254 irradiation time generated more tcnm and a lower ph produced more dcan from the n chloro α amino acids the degradation pathways of n chlorotyrosine as a representative n chloro α amino acid are proposed and the β scission and 1 2 h shift pathways led to the formation of different precursors of tcnm and dcan the results of this study improve our understanding of the fate of n chloro α amino acids under uv254 irradiation and post chlorination graphic abstract image graphical

reported n chloro α amino acids can cause protein dna cross links kulcharyk et al 2001 produce chromosomal abnormalities and inhibit dna repair pero et al 1996 the stabilities of the n chloro α amino acids were quite variable with half lives in the dark at room temperature ranging from 2 min to more than 96 h stanbro et al 1979 hand et al 1983 armesto et al 1993 how et al 2016 n chloroglycine was the most stable n chloro α amino acid with a half life of over 96 h n chloroproline n chloroaspartic acid n chlorgultamine and n chloroasparagine had the fastest degradation rates with half lives of less than 15 min while the half lives for the other n chloro α amino acids were in the range of 35 min to 4 5 h how et al 2016 the degradation of n chlor α amino acids led to the formation of hazardous intermediates and byproducts such as imines aldehydes carbonyls ammonia and chloride ions stanbro et al 1979 hand et al 1983 simon et al 2019 for example formaldehyde was observed from the decomposition of n chloroglycine hand et al 1983 n chloroalanine decomposition led to the formation of acetaldehyde or pyruvic ion simon et al 2019 n monochlorovaline degraded into isobutyraldehyde and n dichlorovaline degraded into isobutyronitrile and n chloroisobutyraldimine how et al 2017 some of these intermediates can further react with free chlorine to generate n dbps therefore it is essential to understand the fate of n chloro α amino acids in water treatment processes in water treatment uv irradiation is often used along with chlorination li et al 2017 guo et al 2017 cheng et al 2018 liu et al 2020 uv irradiation is popularly used for primary disinfection and chlorine is supplemented as a secondary disinfectant to maintain the residual free chlorine in the distribution system pre chlorination is also sometimes applied for algae removal and taste and odor control in the beginning of water treatment chains in addition uv irradiation and chlorination have recently been used together as an advanced oxidation process and the generated hydroxyl and chlorine radicals effectively eliminated micropollutants watts et al 2007 lei et al 2019 under these conditions the generated n chloro α amino acids were exposed to uv irradiation the n cl bonds in the n chloro α amino acids generally have a uv absorbance in the range of 250 280 nm how et al 2016 overlapping with a low pressure uv emission wavelength of 254 nm uv254 thus the photolysis of n chloro α amino acids may lead to the breakage of the n cl bonds eq 1 and eq 2 this will change their stability and subsequent n dbp formation a few previous studies have reported that the n cl cleavage of n chloroglycine n chloroarginine and n chlorohistidine under uv254 photolysis resulted in the formation of ammonia or cyanogen chloride weng and blatchley 2013 a recent study reported that n cl bond in n chloroatenolol was cleaved by uv254 irradiation to form amines and ammonia ra et al 2019 furthermore the cleavage of the n cl band can produce a series of radicals e g cl ho and cl2 via complex chain reactions and enhance pollutant elimination sun et al 2019 yin et al 2020 thus the n chloro α amino acids possibly degrade through both direct uv254 induced photolysis and indirect radical involved reactions until now the kinetics and mechanisms of n chloro α amino acid photolysis under uv254 irradiation have not

hypochlorite sigma aldrich usa in ultrapure water to 1000 mg l 1 as cl2 the n chloro α amino acids were prepared in amber glass bottles under continuous stirring on a magnetic stir plate at room temperature each α amino acid solution 0 60 or 0 10 mm was buffered at ph 6 0 or 8 0 with 10 0 mm phosphate buffer a certain amount of free chlorine 0 12 or 0 09 mm was spiked into the α amino acid solution to achieve a free chlorine to α amino acid molar ratio of 0 2 1 or 0 9 1 the solutions were mixed for 4 min except for asparagine 30 min mixing time after the preparation of the n chloro α amino acids the residual free chorine in the solution was undetectable using a chlorine analyzer hach dr 2800 by a dpd free chlorine reagent detection limit 0 02 mg l 1 additionally nh2cl and nhcl2 were analyzed on a membrane introduction mass spectrometry hpr40 hiden germany but the concentration of either nh2cl or nhcl2 was below the detection limit 0 1 mg l 1 for each the concentration of the total chlorine were determined by the same chlorine analyzer using the monof reagent and the full conversion from free chlorine to n chloro α amino acids was confirmed the prepared n chloro α amino acid solutions were used immediately for the uv254 irradiation tests 2 2 experimental procedures the uv254 irradiation setup is shown in figure s1 the uv254 irradiation tests were performed using a quasi collimated beam apparatus with two 10 w low pressure mercury lamps gph 212t5l 4 10 w heraeus the average uv254 fluence rate is entering the solution was determined to be 0 30 mw cm 2 by using iodide iodate chemical actinometry bolton et al 2003 detailed information is provided in text s1 in the si a cylindrical dish containing 210 ml of individual n chloro α amino acid solutions were placed directly under the beam to investigate the degradation kinetics the n chloro α amino acid solution was prepared at a molar ratio of free chlorine with α amino acids of 0 2 1 i e free chlorine 0 12 mm and α amino acids 0 60 mm to minimize the hydrolysis of the n chloro α amino acids li et al 2011 each n chloro α amino acid solution was exposed under uv254 irradiation for pre determined time intervals 1 60 min and then the samples were analyzed for residual n chloro α amino acids the control experiments were conducted in the same manner but without the uv254 irradiation for the slowly degraded n chloro α amino acids i e n chloroglycine and n chloroalanine the dark incubation time was extended to three days n chloroglycine was chosen as a representative compound to evaluate the ph effects with phs varying from 4 5 to 8 0 buffered with a 10 mm phosphate buffer in some of the tests acetate 12 0 mm was added to quench the radicals and explore the effect of direct photolysis on the degradation rates of n chloroglycine under uv254 irradiation in the n dbp formation experiments the n chloro α amino acid solutions were prepared at a molar ratio of free chlorine with the α amino acids of 0 9 1 i e 0 09 mm of free chlorine and 0 10 mm of α amino acids to minimize the formation of n dbps from the residual α amino acids during the post chlorination the experimental procedures were conducted following the same procedures as described above after uv254 irradiation for 20 to 40 min 1 0 mm free chlorine was replenished in the solutions and incubated for 24 h for post chlorination after post chlorination the concentration of residual free chlorine was determined and the stoichiometric amount of ascorbic acid was added to quench the residual chlorine then the solutions were extracted using mtbe and determined for the concentrations of dcan and tcnm all of the above experiments were conducted in duplicate or triplicate to identify the transformation products n chlorotyrosine was selected as a representative n chloro α amino acid n chlorotyrosine was prepared by mixing free chlorine 1 8 mm and tyrosine 2 0 mm at ph 6 0 the n chlorotyrosine solution was subjected to uv254 exposure for 20 min and followed by a 6 h post chlorination with the addition of 20 mm of free chlorine the control tests were conducted by incubating the n chlorotyrosine solutions in the dark for 20 min followed by post chlorination for 6 h samples were collected periodically quenched with ascorbic acid and then extracted with mtbe for identification of the transformation products 2 3 analytical methods the concentrations of the n chloro α amino acids except n chlorophenylalanine and n chlorotyrosine were determined using an uv vis spectrophotometer shimadzu uv 2700 by measuring the absorbance at 254 nm figure s2a li et al 2017 as phenylalanine and tyrosine had uv absorbances both at 254 nm figure s2c they were quantified using the dpd

degradation of the n chloro α amino acids under uv254 irradiation 3 1 1 uv absorption spectra and molar absorptivity of the n chloro α amino acids among the 20 investigated α amino acids sixteen n chloro α amino acids were able to be prepared and used in this study the four amino acids that were not able to be examined included cysteine methionine tryptophan and proline due to the unsuccessful preparation or low stability of their corresponding n chloro α amino acids cysteine methionine and tryptophan cannot form stable n chloro α amino acids upon reaction with free chlorine n chloroproline was not stable and exhibited very fast hydrolysis in the dark 1 58 min 1 at ph 6 0 and was not able to be tracked at the testing time scales the uv absorption characteristics of the sixteen n chloro α amino acids are illustrated in figure s2b the spectra of n chloroglycine as a representative is presented in fig 1 glycine had no absorbance at wavelengths greater than 250 nm the absorption spectra of n chloroglycine peaked at 250 260 nm due to the characterized absorbance of the n cl bonds the other investigated n chloro α amino acids also had peak absorbances from 250 to 280 nm figure s2b the molar absorptivities at 254 nm ε254 of the n chloro α amino acids were calculated text s2 and summarized in table 1 it should be noted that the sixteen tested α amino acids had no absorbance over 250 nm except phenylalanine and tyrosine figure s2 the ε254 for n chlorophenylalanine and n chlorotyrosine were thus obtained after subtracting the absorbance of the remaining phenylalanine and tyrosine in the solutions text s2 the ε254 of the n chloro α amino acids were in the range of 300 to 458 m 1cm 1 at ph 6 0 and 8 0 n chlorotyrosine had the highest absorptivity of 458 m 1cm 1 at ph 6 0 and 442 m 1cm 1 at ph 8 0 and n chlorolysine had the lowest absorptivity 300 m 1cm 1 at ph 6 0 and 325 m 1cm 1 at ph 8 0 these results indicated that the n chloro α amino acids are strong uv absorbers and can undergo direct photolysis under uv254 irradiation 3 1 2 degradation kinetics of the n chloro α amino acids under uv254 irradiation and in the dark the degradation of the sixteen n chloro α amino acids with and without uv254 irradiation was tracked the time evolution of the spectra of n chloroglycine is shown in fig 1 as an example the degradation of n chloro α amino acids followed pseudo first order kinetics with five representatives as shown in fig 2 a as shown in fig 2b the uv254 irradiation obviously enhanced the degradation rates of all the 16 tested n chloro α amino acids compared to their self degradation in the dark without uv254 irradiation without uv254 irradiation the degradation rates of the 16 n chloro α amino acids ranged 1 1 10 3 s 1 n chloroaspartic acid to 2 9 10 5 s 1 n chloroglycine at ph 6 0 in contrast at ph 8 0 figure s3b their dark degradation rates reduced to some extent ranging from 4 9 10 4 s 1 n chloroasparagine to 3 0 10 6 s 1 n chloroglycine in comparison to dark incubation all of the n chloro α amino acids showed higher degradation rate constants under uv254 irradiation k obs uv which were 1 5 18 2 times of those in the dark k obs dark at ph 6 0 fig 2b and 1 1 139 0 times at ph 8 0 figure s3 for example the degradation rate constant of n chloroglycine 5 29 10 4 s 1 was 18 fold faster than that in the dark 0 29 10 4 s 1 at ph 6 0 additionally n chloroglycine prepared using different chlorine and glycine molar ratios 0 2 1 0 5 1 and 0 9 1 exhibited similar degradation kinetics under the uv254 irradiation figure s4 this suggested the effects of the molar ratio of chlorine and α amino acids on the photodegradation of n chloro α amino acids could be ignored the fluence based degradation rate constants and the half life times of the n chloro α amino acids under the uv254 irradiation were calculated details in text s3 and are summarized in table 1 among the tested n chloro α amino acids n chloroaspartic acid had the highest fluence based rate constants and n chlorolysine had the lowest fluence based rate constants at ph 6 0 which were 5 47 10 3 and 1 06 10 3 cm2 mj 1 respectively the half life times of the tested n chloro α amino acids under uv254 irradiation fell in the range of 6 94 35 77 min at ph 6 0 and 13 61 51 34 min at ph 8 0 the apparent quantum yields φapp of the n chloro α amino acids were calculated based on eq 3 and the detailed calculation is provided in text s3 3 φ a p p k photolysis q e 2 303 e 0 i ε 254 k obs uv k obs dark q e 2 303 e 0 i ε 254 where k photolysis is the rate

obs uv qe is 4 706 105 j einstein 1 e0 i is the average fluence rate mw cm 2 and ε254 is the molar extinction coefficient at 254 nm m 1 cm 1 table 1 shows that the φapp of majority of the n chloro α amino acids were in the range of 0 41 0 95 at ph 6 0 and 0 22 0 79 at ph 8 0 however φapp of n chloroaspartic acid n chlorohistidine and n chloroalanine at ph 6 0 exceeded 1 0 implying that chain reactions of radicals may have occurred as discussed in a later section as φapp counted both the direct photolysis and radical oxidation and the innate quantum yields φinn of the n chloro α amino acids were estimated by spiking acetate as a radical scavenger acetate is recalcitrant upon uv254 irradiation and unreactive with n chloro α amino acids acetate has been reported to be reactive towards ho 1 108 m 1s 1 and cl 3 5 107 m 1s 1 yin et al 2020 as such the addition of acetate 100 fold molar excess to α amino acids could distinguish the direct photolysis and radical involved reactions for n chloroaspartic acid n chlorohistidine and n chloroalanine n chloroglycine and n chlorotyrosine were also included for comparison as shown in figure s5 the k obs uv of the five tested n chloro α amino acids in the presence of acetate at ph 6 0 decreased by 20 7 84 5 the φinn of n chloroaspartic acid n chlorohistidine n chloroalanine n chloroglycine and n chlorotyrosine were all lower than φapp which were estimated to be 0 98 0 18 0 75 0 69 and 0 28 respectively these results indicated that the radical involved reactions had some contribution to the degradation of the n chloro α amino acids under uv254 irradiation 3 1 3 the identification of radicals in the uv254 irradiation of the n chloro α amino acids the cleavage of n cl bonds in the n chloro α amino acids upon uv254 irradiation can produce chlorine radicals cl eq 2 dichlorine radicals cl2 and hydroxyl radicals ho may also form due to the cl reactions with cl eq 4 and h2o eqs 5 6 lei et al 2019 lei et al 2021 4 c

examined using the probe compounds e g nitrobenzene benzoic acid and carbamazepine text s4 both cl and cl2 were detected but ho was not detectable at ph 6 0 due to a relatively high level of chloride presented in the solution nearly 0 3 mm the cl readily reacted with chloride eq 4 rather than being converted to ho via eqs 5 and 6 the levels of cl were in the range of approximately 10 16 to 10 15 m and those of cl2 were in the range of approximately 10 15 to 10 14 m under the experimental conditions figure s6 laser flash photolysis experiments were also conducted to obtain direct evidence of the presence of the radicals three n chloro α amino acids named n chloroglycine n chlorohistidine and n chloroaspartic acid were irradiated using a 266 nm laser and the corresponding transient spectra were tracked text s5 maximum absorption bands centered at 340 nm were observed for the three compounds tested figure s7 which may be assigned to cl2 ε340 8800 m 1cm 1 lei et al 2019 the distinct absorption spectra of cl at 320 nm was not observed as the testing the n chloro α amino acids solutions contained 5 mm cl once generated the cl reacted with the cl to rapidly form cl2 eq 4 3 1 4 ph dependence of the photolysis of the n chloro α amino acids the fluence based photodegradation rate constants of n chloro α amino acids at ph 8 0 ranged from 0 74 10 3 to 2 79 10 3cm2 mj 1 which were generally lower than those at ph 6 0 except for n chloroleucine and n chloroasparagine being comparable at both phs the molar absorptivity of the n chloro α amino acids was similar at ph 6 0 and ph 8 0 table 1 in contrast φapp of the n chloro α amino acids at ph 8 0 0 04 0 79 were between 14 7 and 93 1 lower than those at ph 6 0 table 1 these results highlighted that the photolysis of the n chloro α amino acids was ph dependent n chloroglycine was selected as a representative compound to deeply investigate the effects of ph ranging from 4 5 to 8 0 as shown in figure s8 the photo degradation of n chloroglycine was fastest at ph 4 5 8 0 10 4 s 1 then slowed down to 5 3 10 4 s 1 at ph 6 0 followed by 4 7 10 4 s 1 at ph 7 0 and 4 5 10 4 s 1 at ph 8 0 however the dark degradation rates of the n chloroglycine at the investigated phs were lower than 2 10 5 s 1 suggesting that ph primarily affected the photo involved processes rather than the dark hydrolysis of n chloroglycine to distinguish the ph effects on direct photolysis or the radical reactions acetate 12 mm was added into the solution to quench cl and stop the secondary radical reactions with the presence of acetate the k obs of n chloroglycine gradually decreased from 5 3 10 4 s 1 at ph 4 5 and to 2 8 10 4 s 1 at ph 8 0 indicating ph obviously affected direct photolysis although the pk a value of glycine was 9 58 table 1 the presence of the strong electron withdrawing chlorine in the n chloroglycine greatly reduced the pk a value of the nhcl zhao et al 2020 based on the quantum chemical computations the pk a of n chloroglycine was estimated to be 4 5 text s6 when the ph was near to its pk a value pk a 4 5 n chloroglycine tended to transform to nhcl by protonation in contrast when the ph values were higher than its pk a values the unprotonated nhcl was dominant according to the experimental results and the calculated pk a of n chloroglycine it was concluded that the ph affected the speciation of n chloroglycine and the protonated nhcl may have higher photosensitivity than the unprotonated nhcl 3 2 photolysis of the n chloro α amino acids affected the formation potential of the tcnm and dcan n chloro α amino acids are known to be n dbp precursors tcnm and dcan formation from n chloro α amino acids followed by post chlorination 1 0 mm chlorine and 24 h incubation was evaluated at ph 6 0 and 8 0 with and without uv254 irradiation treatment it should be noted that the concentrations of tcnm and dcan were undetectable during uv254 irradiation alone the tcnm and dcan formation potentials after 24 h post chlorination are presented in fig 3 after uv254 irradiation less than 0 02 mm of ammonia formed in the solution when 1 0 mm of free chlorine was supplemented in post chlorination the ammonia entirely converted into nitrogen via breakpoint chlorination the concentrations of inorganic chloramine were undetectable ten n chloro α amino acids produced tcnm under uv254 irradiation followed by post chlorination at ph 6 0 whereas dark incubation barely generated detectable tcnm except for n chloroserine n chlorothreonine and n chloroleucine with concentrations of 0 5 2 5 and 2 8 μg l 1 respectively fig 3a clearly uv254 irradiation of n chloro α amino acids significantly enhanced tcnm formation during post chlorination for example the tcnm yields of n chlorothreonine increased by 296 from 2 8 to 11 1 μg l 1 after 20 min uv254 irradiation followed by post chlorination at ph 6 0 additionally n chlorotyrosine and n chloroglycine produced 1 1 and 5 0 μg l 1 of tcnm in the 20 min uv254 irradiation followed by post chlorination at ph 6 0 however no tcnm was observed from n chlorotyrosine and n chloroglycine after 20 min of dark incubation with post chlorination an increase in the tcnm formation potential after uv254 irradiation was also observed at ph 8 0 figure s9a furthermore increasing the uv254 irradiation time tended to increase the tcnm yields at both ph 6 0 fig 4 a and ph 8 0 figure s10a when the uv254 irradiation time increased from 5 to 40 min corresponding to the uv254 dose increasing from 91 2 to 729 6 mj cm 2 the tcnm yields of n chlorotyrosine increased from 0 2 to 1 8 μg l 1 at ph 6 0 and increased from 0 3 to 1 9 μg l 1 at ph 8 0 similarly the tcnm yields of n chloroglycine increased by 361 from 1 8 to 8 3 μg l 1 at ph 6 0 and increased by 453 from 1 5 to 8 3 μg l 1 at ph 8 0 these results also suggest that the tcnm formation from the n chloro α amino acids exhibited limited ph dependence in the uv254 irradiation system in contrast the uv254 irradiation exhibited varied effects on the formation of dcan during post chlorination fig 3b at ph 6 0 most of the n chloro α amino acids formed dcan regardless of uv254 irradiation application or not without the uv254 irradiation the dcan yields of n chloroarginine n chloroglutamic acid n chloroglutamine and n chlorolysine were 281 3 11 5 11 9 and 7 9 μg l 1 respectively after 20 min of uv254 irradiation the yields of dcan from these compounds increased by 91 0 13 0 30 8 and 67 6 respectively for the other n chloro α amino acids e g n chloroaspartic acid n chlorohistidine n chloroasparagine and n chlorotyrosine the changes in the dcan yields were less than 5 additionally prolonging the uv254 irradiation time from 5 to 40 min had no significant impacts on dcan formation for n chlorotyrosine n chlorothreonine n chlorolysine n chloroglycine and n chloroalanine at ph 6 0 fig 4b however ph significantly affected the dcan yields of the tested n chloro α amino acids the levels of dcan at ph 8 0 fig s9b were much lower than those at ph 6 0 fig 3b for example the dcan formation potential from n chlorotyrosine by uv254 irradiation at ph 6 0 248 0 μg l 1 was approximately 15 fold higher than that at ph 8 0 15 9 μg l 1 the dcan formation potential after photolysis of n chloroasparagine was 68 fold higher at ph 6 0 263 0 μg l 1 than that at ph 8 0 3 8 μg l 1 these results suggested that the dcan formation potentials from n chloro α amino acids during uv254 irradiation exhibited strong ph dependence and a lower ph condition tended to produce more dcan as discussed in section 3 1 ph affected the photo degradation rates of n chloro α amino acids the k obs uv at ph 6 0 were essentially higher than that at ph 8 0 furthermore ph also altered the species and roles of reactive radicals more cl tended to be consumed by ho at ph 8 0 compared to that at ph 6 0 as a result less dcan precursors were formed from the photodegradation of n chloro α amino acid at ph 8 0 than that of at ph 6 0 in addition to the tcnm and dcan the formations of regular organic halogenated by products were also measured and the trichloromethane tcm chloral hydrate ch and dichloroacetaldehyde dcal of the n chloro α amino acids were observed figure s11 among the 16 investigated n chloro α amino acids the n chloroaspartic acid produced the highest amount of tcm ch and dcal in the uv254 irradiation followed by post chlorination process which may have been attributed to its fastest uv254 induced degradation rate most of investigated n chloro α amino acids generated a small amount of tcm 10 μg l 1 except for n chloroaspartic acid and n chlorotyrosine different n chloro α amino acids exhibited different dbp formation potentials due to their distinct molecular structures and photodegradation kinetics the impacts of the uv254 irradiation were also varied the difference trends in the dbp formation potential suggested that the uv254 irradiation exerted different impacts on the precursors of tcnm and dcan thus understanding the degradation pathways of n chloro α amino acids and the generation of n dbp precursors are necessary 3 3 intermediates and degradation pathways of n chlorotyrosine as a representative n chloro amino acid to obtain insights into the intermediates and the degradation pathways of n chloro α amino acids under uv254 irradiation and during post chlorination n chlorotyrosine was chosen as a representative compound because it generated a great amount of both tcnm and dcan during post chlorination fig 3 four primary transformation products were observed during uv254 irradiation of n chlorotyrosine at ph 6 0 including tp136 c8h8o2 tp133 c8h7no tp167 c8h6clno and tp122 c7h6o2 specifically tp136 and tp122 were identified as 2 4 hydroxyphenyl acetaldehyde and 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde respectively tp133 was identified as 2 4 hydroxyphenyl acetonitrile and tp167 was a monochlorinated product of tp133 the proposed structures ion chromatograms and extracted ion mass ms spectra of these intermediates are provided in table s2 and figure s12 the time dependent evolution of these intermediates are illustrated in fig 5 a tp136 was predominant among these intermediates the highest signal of tp136 reached or was near the maximum yields in the first sampling point at 5 min and remained stable during the 20 min uv254 exposure period tp133 and tp167 were also generated quickly within 5 min of uv254 irradiation and their yields decreased with an extension of uv254 irradiation time from 5 min to 20 min tp122 was formed slowly and the intensity of tp122 was relatively lower than the other three intermediates notably tp136 was abundant under the uv254 irradiation fig 5a whereas it did not form in the dark fig 5b tp133 tp167 and tp122 were formed during the uv254 irradiation whereas these intermediates were not observed in the without uv254 irradiation condition as shown in fig 5 ammonium n was observed during the degradation of n chlorotyrosine with uv254 irradiation figure s13 additionally formic acid approximately 0 3 mm and acetic acid approximately 0 04 mm were also formed via decarboxylation figure s14 these intermediates confirmed the enhanced degradation of n chlorotyrosine under the uv254 irradiation the predominant intermediate tp136 tended to the main tcnm precursors in the uv254 irradiation system since the negligible tcnm formed under the without uv254 irradiation condition in the subsequent post chlorination the aldehyde product tp136 formed during the uv254 irradiation decreased dramatically fig 5a in contrast the abundance of the nitrile product tp167 increased quickly and achieved the maximum after 3 min of post chlorination this was then followed by a decreasing trend other products including chlorinated 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde tp156 c8h9clo chlorinated phenol tp128 c6h5clo and dcan tp 109 c2hcl2n were observed but with lower intensities than tp167 fig 5b shows that during the post chlorination without uv254 treatment the nitrile product tp167 was also the primary intermediate and formed quickly when free chlorine was supplemented the maximum intensity of tp167 in the dark incubation was four times higher than that after uv254 irradiation another nitrile product tp133 became the highest after 50 min post chlorination without the uv254 irradiation aldehyde products tp122 and tp156 and chlorinated phenol tp128 were also observed in post chlorination without the uv254 irradiation and their intensities were generally comparable with those with the uv254 irradiation scheme 1 proposes the transformation pathways of n chlorotyrosine during uv254 irradiation and post chlorination initially uv254 irradiation led to the cleavage of the n cl bond in n chlorotyrosine generating cl and aminyl radicals cl tended to react with intermediates or was converted to cl2 and aminyl radicals were in equilibrium with the aminyl radical cations afterward c centered radicals were formed primarily via two pathways the 1 2 h shift and β scission following the 1 2 h shift pathway the aminyl radicals were converted into α carbon centered radicals accompanied with decarboxylation the neighboring amino group was transformed into an imine group to form 4 2 iminoethyl phenol subsequently r1 pathway ra et al 2019 then the 4 2 iminoethyl phenol underwent deamination and hydrolysis yielding 2 4 hydroxyphenyl acetaldehyde tp136 and releasing ammonium n in addition the imine moiety was converted to chlorinated imine by the attack of cl and cl2 which were further transformed to 2 4 hydroxyphenyl acetonitrile tp133 via de chlorination upon uv254 irradiation following the r2 pathway additionally inorganic monochloramine nh2cl may have been generated from the released ammonium n and trace hocl in equilibrium with the n chloro α amino acids the reaction between nh2cl and the aldehyde product tp136 could also form tp133 r3 pathway then tp167 was formed through the chlorination of tp133 by either hocl or chlorine radicals cl and cl2 these nitrile products e g tp167 and tp133 could further transform to dcan during post chlorination during the β scission pathway the aminyl radicals produced β c centered radicals and 2 iminoacetic acid r4 chlorine radicals cl and cl2 attacked some imines and chlorinated imines generated during the uv254 irradiation r5 subsequently chlorinated imines could be oxidized to a nitro group and thus formed tcnm during post chlorination r6 additionally the hydrolysis of β c centered radicals formed 4 hydroxybenzaldehyde tp122 the aldehyde intermediates tp136 and tp122 tended to convert to chlorinated imines via chloramination r7 leading to the formation of chlorinated phenolic products tp128 and tp156 and chlorinated imines r8 the formed chlorinated imines could also be oxidized to tcnm during post chlorination yang et al 2012 based on the proposed mechanisms the 1 2 h shift photodegradation pathway of n chlorotyrosine generated dcan precursors however both the β scission and 1 2 h shift pathway initiated the generation of the tcnm precursors essentially uv254 photolysis and the participation of reactive chlorine radicals greatly contributed to the formation of the tcnm precursors 4 conclusions uv254 irradiation could significantly enhance the n chloro α amino acids degradation via the uv254 induced cleavage of n cl bonds and radical oxidation the degradation rate constants and apparent quantum yields φapp of the n chloro α amino acids were quite variable with the fluence based rate constant ranging from 1 06 10 3 to 5 47 10 3 cm2 mj 1 at ph 6 0 and φapp varying from 0 41 1 23 at ph 6 0 the n chloro α amino acids had lower degradation rates at ph 8 0 than ph 6 0 the uv254 irradiation exhibited different effects on the formation potentials of tcnm and dcan the tcnm formation potential was greatly enhanced in the tested n chloro α amino acids compared to that without uv254 irradiation but the dcan formation potential varied the uv254 induced degradation of the n chloro α amino acids generated aldehydes and nitriles some of which may persist in treated water for days or continue to degrade into dbps during post chlorination when the n chloro α amino acids containing waters were exposed to uv254 treatment the generation of n dbp precursors should be a concern shortening the uv254 irradiation time could inhibit the formation of the tcnm precursors in addition the adjustment of the ph to an alkaline condition could benefit a reduction in the formation of the dcan precursors some pretreatment methods such as pre ozonation are also recommended to remove α amino acids and control the n dbps overall the kinetic and mechanistic information obtained from this study can be useful for understanding the fate of n chloro α amino acids upon uv254 irradiation in water and wastewater treatment declaration of competing interest the authors
