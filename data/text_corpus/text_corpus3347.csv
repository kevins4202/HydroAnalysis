organic pollutants pops known as preoccupying substances for the environment active biomonitoring abm is a surveillance method for polluted aquatic ecosystems measuring bioavailable contamination in this work the aim was to quantify the total links between environmental pressures and bioavailable contamination for pahs and pcbs at the french national scale based on 245 sites experimented by abm from 2017 to 2019 environmental pressures anthropogenic pressures and environmental parameters were defined point source landfill density point source urban density point source industry density point

biomonitoring nonpoint sources pah pcb point sources stressors 1 introduction freshwater ecosystems are subject to various chemical contaminants linked to specific sources and vectors of transfer but studying these links at large scale remains difficult with their high persistence in the environment legacy persistent organic pollutants pops are preoccupying lohmann et al 2007 motelay massei et al 2004 as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs some of them are listed as priority substances by the european union water framework directive wfd european commission 2008 pcbs are known for their strong persistence in the environment even after their banished usage dendievel et al 2019 mourier et al 2014 pcbs were used in electric materials for industrial and urban areas gustafson 1970 their past sources were mainly from incineration of waste and elimination of electric transformers inducing a dispersion of pcbs mostly atmospheric amiard et al 2016 despite the ban on their production and uses pcbs are ubiquitous in freshwater they are able to sediment due to their low solubility in water gustafson 1970 and hydrophobicity jones and de voogt 1999 their hydrophobicity enables them to contaminate trophic chains babut et al 2011 this happened in the rhône river in france mourier et al 2014 these organic contaminants can be present in soils of landfills amiard et al 2016 dendievel et al 2019 pahs are also ubiquitous pops well known for their atmospheric presence low vapor pressure low solubility in water ravindra et al 2008 and difficult degradation zhi et al 2015 pahs ongoing origins are atmospheric deposition from combustion bertrand et al 2015 coles et al 2012 ravindra et al 2008 urban density industrialization bertrand et al 2015 coles et al 2012 motelay massei et al 2004 and leaching from roads coles et al 2012 ravindra et al 2008 covered with coal tars degiorgi and badot 2020 water runoff from precipitation can also induce pulses of contamination in watercourses ravindra et al 2008 uher et al 2016 concentrations of pcbs and pahs were often measured in a selection of sites next to a specific source of contamination punctual measurements of contaminants are frequently below the limits of quantification and do not consider bioavailable concentrations present in biota ciliberti et al 2017 to take into account bioavailability instead of measuring contaminants in water and sediment they were dosed in biota for example in mussels in the mussel watch program kimbrough et al 2008 and in oysters and mussels in the rocch program ifremer 2008 active biomonitoring abm measures bioavailable concentrations of contaminants in transplanted organisms besse et al 2013 wepener 2013 the measures in biota enable better quantification of contaminants with low concentrations arnold et al 2021 emphasized the necessity of understanding large spatial scale contamination sources and the difficulty of considering native bioindicators meanwhile active biomonitoring generates measures of contaminants at a large spatial scale and allows a comparison of these measures ciliberti et al 2017 gammarids are dominant macroinvertebrates from the crustacean group and are ubiquitous in french freshwater besse et al 2013 they are used as active biomonitoring probes to measure bioavailable contamination because they are net accumulators of chemical substances chaumot et al 2015 bioconcentrations of pahs and pcbs in gammarids are easily measured besse et al 2013 alric et al 2019 anthropogenic pressures generated by human activities can influence on contamination craig et al 2017 e g pah and pcb of freshwater ecosystems at large scale these pressures can be sources of contamination like urban zones kaushal et al 2014 and industrial discharges steele et al 2010 they can also be factors of transfer of contaminants like hydromorphological alterations dendievel et al 2019 hydromorphological modifications can impact on sediment transfer and thus the bioavailability of organic contaminants adsorbed to the sediment brunet 2007 for instance alterations of the watercourse like modification of discharges by dams can generate deposition and remobilization of sediments on which organic pollutants are adsorbed bertrand et al 2015 dendievel et al 2019 straightening watercourses is an indicator of morphological alteration that can act on the velocity of flows and increase erosions of banks and sediment transport garcia et al 2012 eutrophication defined as a high concentration of nutrients can also influence on the bioavailability of contaminants akkanen et al 2012 chapman 2018 tao et al 2017 numerous studies started to quantify the links between pressures and biological responses dahm et al 2013 riseng et al 2011 stendera et al 2012 villeneuve et al 2018 in order to manage multiple pressures in freshwater quantifying the links between pressures and contamination is required the links between pressures and contamination are often studied at local scales for example uher et al 2016 investigated the links between anthropogenic pressures and pahs in freshwater in the seine river frissell et al 1986 highlighted the necessity of considering the hierarchy of scales when studying links between anthropogenic pressures stream functioning is studied following a hierarchy of scales allan 2004 poff 1997 because the links between parameters at a large spatial scale can be different from the ones at a local spatial scale to investigate the impact of a specific pressure the appropriate scale should be chosen nevertheless confronting pressures to pops measurements on a large scale can be challenging these measurements in water are frequently below the quantification limit of analytical methods and thus contamination data distribution can have missing low values ciliberti et al 2017 sarkis et al 2020 proposed an explanatory model to quantify the links between pressures and metallic bioavailable contamination at a large scale the current study aims to quantify at large scale the links between pressures and bioavailable organic contamination for pahs and pcbs of french watercourses we selected pressures constituted of point sources at a local scale close to the site and nonpoint sources at large scales like the watershed of contamination potential factors of transfer of contaminants as well as environmental parameters then we established a conceptual model representing each pressure via stressor indicators at its suitable scale of occurrence and considering bioavailable contamination as the final output the scales of the pressures were the watershed upstream influence reach and site scale and the scale of bioavailable organic contamination was the site scale hypotheses of links between pressures and bioavailable pah and pcb contamination were set following a structural equation model these links among pressures and the links between pressures and bioavailable contamination were quantified with partial least squares path modeling pls pm lastly the dominant links of pressures with bioavailable pah and pcb were compared at adequate spatial scales 2 material and methods 2 1 contamination data from pops regulatory surveillance via abm bioavailable concentrations data pahs and pcbs are extracted from the national database naïades gathering measurements implemented by the french regional water agencies they have been recently implementing bioconcentration measurements with transplanted gammarids abm babut et al 2020 for the wfd following the standardized protocol defined in afnor 2019 control gammarus fossarum were sampled from an uncontaminated site in france saint maurice de rémens they were acclimated in controlled conditions in the laboratory for two weeks with leaves as food body sized calibrated males were caged in watercourses for an exposition period of three weeks during non flood events sex and weight are controlled to avoid their effects on bioconcentration besse et al 2013 ciliberti et al 2017 quantification of contaminants in gammarids surviving was performed by a cofrac accredited laboratory lda26 with a minimum of 1 5 g of wet weight of gammarids per site after the exposition pops were dosed in gammarids via mass spectrometry more specifically 11 pahs anthracene benzo b j fluoranthene benzo k fluoranthene benzo g h i perylene benzo a pyrene chrysene fluoranthene fluorene naphtalene phenanthrene and pyrene and 17 pcbs pcb 28 pcb 52 pcb 77 pcb 101 pcb 105 pcb 114 pcb 118 pcb 123 pcb 126 pcb 138 pcb 149 pcb 153 pcb 156 pcb 157 pcb 167 pcb 170 and pcb 180 the 245 caging sites were distributed over the national scale of france sites in different hydroecoregions represented a diversity of landscapes with contamination measures from 2017 to 2019 fig 1 a hydroecoregion type 1 is a homogeneous zone in terms of geology relief and climate wasson et al 2002 the maximum concentration of each contaminant per site for different samplings was considered with its specific caging date the few concentrations below the limit of quantification lq were replaced by the measure of the lq divided by 2 considering sites in the nationwide french monitoring network covered a spatially contrasted range of concentrations of bioavailable pahs and pcbs 2 2 choices of pressures and stressor indicators at multiple scales and conceptual model building to associate each abm experimented site to anthropogenic pressures we first chose potential sources of pops contamination based on literature pahs may be originated from punctual industries urbanization bertrand et al 2015 coles et al 2012 motelay massei et al 2004 and roads coles et al 2012 ravindra et al 2008 while pcbs are usually diffused in urban environments due to their past use dendievel et al 2019 mourier et al 2014 to represent diffuse sources of pops in our conceptual model fig 2 we chose indicators of three possible nonpoint sources of pops nonpoint source industry density nonpoint source urban density and nonpoint source road density besides we considered four point sources point source industry density point source urban density point source road density and point source landfill density we selected five environmental parameters possibly modulating bioavailable pops contamination coarse sediment soil permeability watershed size hydrographic network density and summer precipitation we also integrated hydromorphology dams slopes and straightness as a transfer vector of pops and eutrophication nutrients and organic matter representing deteriorated water quality stressor indicators were selected based on expert knowledge and data availability to represent these pressures that can have a potential link with pops bioavailable contamination fig 2 the used spatial scales were a the site b the reach defined as a zone with homogeneous hydrographic characteristics c the upstream influence of 5 10 and 20 km represented with a buffer zone upstream of each site and d the watershed delimited for each site with a digital elevation model dem nonpoint source industry density nonpoint source urban density and nonpoint source road density coarse sediment soil permeability watershed size hydrographic network density and summer precipitation were large scale pressures at the watershed scale point source industry density point source urban density point source road density and point source landfill density were at the upstream influence of 5 10 and 20 km of each site dams slope and straightness were at the reach scale nutrients and organic matter pressure was at the site scale the pressures their stressor indicators and sources of data are detailed in table 1 for each site all stressors were calculated at their scale via geographic information system all pressures were linked to pops contamination fig 2 we supposed a positive correlation between all pressures except soil permeability and pops bioavailable contamination because these variables were sources of pops factors favorable for more pops in the watercourse or transfer factors of pops as for soil permeability we expected a negative correlation with pops bioconcentration point source landfill density point source industry density nonpoint source industry density point source road density nonpoint source road density point source urban density nonpoint source urban density dams slope and straightness were linked to nutrients and organic matter in freshwater fig 2 with an expected positive correlation these links of pressures with nutrients and organic matter contributed to the indirect links of pressures with bioavailable persistent organic contamination 2 3 statistical modeling a preliminary principal component analysis pca based on a site substance matrix gathering bioavailable contamination data was performed with xlstat 2019 more specifically on the dataset including bioconcentrations of pcbs and pahs with the sum of ipcbs and the sum of pahs the sum of ipcbs had already been used as a representative indicator of pcbs babut et al 2009 this pca investigates covariations in our dataset among pahs or pcbs and between them this analysis led to parametrize two separate models with respectively the sum of pahs and the sum of ipcbs as outputs see results the adopted statistical modeling methodology for the quantification of links defined in fig 2 was the same as villeneuve et al 2018 sarkis et al 2020 pls pm was adopted because this modeling can quantify the links between multiple pressures taking into account direct and indirect links without multicollinearity issues tenenhaus et al 2005 it is a type of structural equation modeling constituted with two sub models based on regressions fernandes 2012 vinzi et al 2010 when studying the links between pressures and pops the measurement model defines the pressures based on stressor indicators following the eq 1 y j h w jh x jh w j x j where yj is the external estimation of the pressure variable j wjh are the coefficients linking a linear combination between pressure j and stressor indicator h xjh are the stressor indicators h of pressure j wj and xj are respectively the column vectors of wjh and xjh representing each a matrix of one column with multiple elements the structural model quantifies the links between pressures based on eq 2 z j i i j cij 0 e ji y i where z j is the internal estimation of the pressure j shows that the variable on the left of this symbol is obtained by a reduction of the variable on the right of this symbol e ji is the path coefficient regression coefficient of the structural model y i is the external estimation of pressure i i i j is the condition for which i is divisible by i is different from j and cij 0 is a non nullity of coefficients fernandes 2012 the algorithm is detailed in tenenhaus et al 2005 and vinzi et al 2010 the direct link was first obtained between each two linked pressures the indirect link was based on the product of links between two pressures and an intermediate pressure the total link resulted from the sum of direct and indirect links for each pls pm model direct and indirect links between pressures and respectively the sum of pahs and the sum of ipcbs were quantified with correlation values then the total links of pressures with pops bioavailable contamination were determined in xlstat 2019 indirect links were mainly negligible due to the construction of the model the coefficient of determination r2 representing the explanation of contamination by pressures was computed significant results were determined by a jackknife method the link of each pressure with contamination was analyzed only for significant correlation values higher than 0 1 3 results 3 1 co occurrence of pcbs and pahs bioavailable contamination the pca correlation circle revealed a strong structure of correlation among pcbs and pahs bioavailable data fig 3 the f1 axis had the most explanation with 56 followed by the f2 axis with 18 a clear separation appears between all the pcbs and pahs these groups of variables being almost perpendicular are weakly correlated for each group of contaminants pcbs and pahs all the substances were correlated and respectively pahs and pcbs were correlated with the sum of pahs and the sum of ipcbs though high molecular weight pahs benzo b j fluoranthene benzo k fluoranthene benzo g h i perylene benzo a pyrene chrysene and fluoranthene were better represented than low molecular weight pahs naphtalene anthracene pyrene fluorene and phenanthrene on the pca this result confirmed having two respective models for pahs and pcbs 3 2 representativeness of pressures at multiple scales table 2 states the correlation of each stressor indicator with its specific pressure in both pls pm models the pahs sum model and ipcbs sum model when a pressure was represented by only one stressor indicator the correlation between the pressure and the stressor indicator was equal to 1 all stressor indicators represented their specific pressure non negligible values only population density at the upstream influence of 5 10 and 20 km in both models and wastewater treatment plants presence at the upstream influence of 5 10 and 20 km in the pahs sum model had low correlations with their pressures in the pahs sum model nonpoint source urban density was correlated more with surface of urban land use at the watershed than population density at the watershed and inversely in the ipcbs sum model in both models point source urban density was correlated the most with surface of urban land use at 20 km upstream of the site and correlated the least with population density at 5 km upstream of the site stressor indicators at 5 10 and 20 km were correlated differently with their pressure like for point source industry density point source urban density point source road density and point source landfill density dissolved oxygen is the only stressor indicator with a negative correlation with its specific pressure nutrients and organic matter 3 3 quantified links between pressures and bioavailable organic contamination fig 4 represents the total links between pressures and the sum of pah bioavailable contamination the r2 is equal to 0 345 meaning that 35 of pah s bioavailable contamination is explained by the selected pressures the highest positive correlation with pah bioavailable contamination was with point source urban density represented mostly by surface of urban land use 0 237 followed by nutrients and organic matter 0 205 summer precipitation 0 142 straightness 0 139 and point source industry density 0 106 no significant negative correlations of pressures with pah s bioavailable contamination were reported fig 5 represents total links between pressures and pcb bioavailable contamination r2 is equal to 0 338 meaning that 34 of pcb bioavailable contamination was explained by pressures four pressures are positively correlated with bioavailable ipcbs nonpoint source urban density 0 194 nonpoint source industry density 0 131 nonpoint source road density 0 123 and watershed size 0 110 no significant negative correlations of pressures with pcb bioavailable contamination were reported 4 discussion 4 1 pcbs and pahs distinctions according to the pca fig 3 bioavailable pcbs and pahs contaminations were poorly correlated among the experimented sites their difference can be possibly explained by having different sources and or fate in the environment that we further investigated based on our conceptual model separately for both families fig 2 jones and de voogt 1999 presented different families of pops including pahs and pcbs they share similarities in terms of hydrophobic properties adsorption to sediments kimbrough et al 2008 mourier et al 2014 toxicity persistence bioaccumulation and long range transport lohmann et al 2007 but differ in molecular structure ineris 2012 soleille and brignon 2006 and origins olenycz et al 2015 fig 3 also showed correlations between all pahs with the sum of pahs on one side and all pcbs with the sum of ipcbs on the other side supporting similarities of substances in each respective family this supports the decision of representing each family by respectively the sum of pahs and the sum of ipcbs the high molecular pahs were better represented than the low molecular pahs on the pca probably due to their higher accumulation in gammarids 4 2 representativeness of pressures at multiple scales in the current study a conceptualized model linking pressures to pops bioavailable contamination has been elaborated for the first time and applied at the national scale of france there are often accessible data of pressures with wide gradients at a large spatial scale but quantification of contamination in multiple sites with contrasted contamination levels at a large scale remains challenging the use of active biomonitoring enabled this nationwide quantification of bioavailable pops contamination this model is constituted by a selection of pressures anthropogenic pressures and natural parameters point source and or nonpoint source density of industries urban zones landfills and roads nutrients and organic matter dams slope straightness coarse sediment soil permeability watershed size hydrographic network density and summer precipitation the stressor indicators were chosen based on literature and expertise of ecotoxicologists hydroecologists hydromorphologists and hydrologists and dependent on the availability of data for all sites representing a pressure with a group of stressor indicators had the advantage of considering stressor indicators with different distributions and variable correlations with their pressure table 2 since point source urban density was mostly correlated with surface of urban land use at 5 10 and 20 km upstream of the site the link of this pressure with pahs contamination will mostly be representative of urban areas and not specifically wastewater treatment plants and population density in addition representing stressor indicators at multiple spatial scales represented complementary information on the pressure as for respectively point source industry density point source urban density point source road density and point source landfill density the more nutrients and organic matter increased the less dissolved oxygen there was hypotheses of links between pressures were used to build the conceptualized structure of the model in order to quantify total links of pressures depending on data availability other pressures and stressor indicators could be added later to the model to test other links for example only current landfills were integrated in the model as an influencing factor on deposition of pahs and pcbs but former landfills could also be considered because they are potential sources of organic contamination in waste dumping brunet 2007 in the same way not only current industries can be considered as potential sources of pahs but also past ones bertrand et al 2015 we chose to study the links between industries and pah bioavailable contamination however the links with specific types of industries like petrochemical industries could be investigated ravindra et al 2008 regarding hydrology since caging of gammarids was performed during non flood events the frequency and intensity of floods were not considered summer precipitation was considered to describe the contrast in precipitation between different sites and geographical zones we opted for summer precipitation in particular to represent the precipitation regimes of sites and discriminate more the contrasts in precipitations between different hydroclimatic zones rather than considering the annual precipitation mean storm weirs collecting rain and enhancing leaching of pollutants from soils could therefore be a complementary pressure hubaux and perceval 2011 the increased density of the hydrographic network was an indicator of possible drainage of more contaminants the choice of multiple scales enabled the study of links between pressures and bioavailable organic contamination at multiple spatial scales point source pressures were measured at the local scale of upstream influence and nonpoint source pressures were calculated at the watershed scale we hypothesized that pressures represented at different scales had different correlations with bioavailable organic contamination 4 3 the relationship of bioavailable pahs with point and nonpoint source pressures the construction of both models enabled a quantification of links between pressures and bioavailable organic contamination represented by respectively the sum of bioavailable pahs and the sum of bioavailable ipcbs the chosen pressures explained 35 of pah bioavailable contamination in our dataset four environmental pressures were positively correlated with pah bioavailable contamination the first positive correlation was point source urban density reflecting a local urban runoff link with bioavailable pah barhoumi et al 2019 found that high concentrations of pahs were detected in highly populated urban areas due to anthropogenic activities releasing these contaminants then the second positive correlation was with nutrients and organic matter it reflected potentially the situation of sites with often more nutrients and organic matter with increased pah contamination this situation can be explained by runoffs enriched with nutrients and organic matter for instance with urbanization water quality can be degraded with a co occurrence of enrichments with nutrients and organic matter as well as pollutants allan 2004 suspended particulate matter a stressor indicator of altered water quality could be adsorbed to pahs li et al 2020 and it can be a possible vector of pahs to biota the third positive correlation was with summer precipitation highlighting that pah bioconcentration is dependent on a precipitation zonation precipitations are well known to mobilize contaminants like pahs present in the atmosphere to reach the watercourse blanchard et al 2004 ollivon et al 1999 the fourth positive correlation is with straightness an indicator of straightening considered as a morphological alteration meandering rivers can induce more diverse flow and more deposits of fine sediments thus more diverse environmental conditions garcia et al 2012 and possibly more denitrification oraison et al 2011 simplifying flows and associated deposit forms often observed in straightened watercourses as well as artificial riverbanks can induce less adsorption of pahs to riverbanks and more pahs in circulation this link is highlighted but is not a very high correlation possibly due to the indicator representing a probability of watercourse physical alteration and also due to other possible sources like occurrence of roads next to straightened watercourses the fifth positive correlation with point source industry density was supported by literature bertrand et al 2015 coles et al 2012 to summarize the links of pressures with bioavailable pahs were quantified at multiple scales bioavailable pah contamination was influenced by local scale pressures as point source urban density nutrients and organic matter in the site and point source industry density and large scale pressures such as summer precipitation in the watershed as hypothesized in the conceptual model pressures considered as vectors of transfer of pahs e g summer precipitation and straightness had an important link with bioavailable pah contamination positive correlation the developed model may identify environmental drivers of contamination to manage bioavailable contamination of pahs this first study suggests that studying specific sources of pah contamination should be encouraged as well as factors of transfer 4 4 the relationship of bioavailable pcbs with nonpoint source pressures for ipcbs 34 of contamination was explained by pressures three sources of contamination nonpoint source urban density nonpoint source industry density and nonpoint source road density were positively correlated with pcb bioavailable contamination unlike pah bioavailable contamination linked with sources and factors of transfer these pressures acting mostly on ipcbs bioavailable contamination were mainly nonpoint source pressures spatially diffuse at a large scale pcbs are banned from the 80s in france and their emissions in the environment have decreased since then cire 2010 pcbs found in the environment are mostly inherited from the recent past and mobilized by vectors of transfer they are currently occurring in a diffuse way in the environment with a link to urbanization roads and industries diamond et al 2010 watershed size was also positively correlated with ipcbs bioavailable contamination highlighting the possible influence of large scale sources of ipcbs that are more numerous in big watersheds than small ones coles et al 2012 and bertrand et al 2015 declared a relationship between pops and adsorption to sediments hubaux and perceval 2011 also highlighted the link between sediments and pcbs the coarse sediment indicator aimed to represent the particle size of sediments to determine the different storage types of ipcbs from the riverbed to the floodplain and in more or less erodible geomorphic units in the current study there was no correlation between the particle size at the watershed scale and pops this could be due to differences in timings between releases of pops during sediment mobilization when there were floods and exposures of caged gammarids more measures could better evaluate this link in addition gammarids are exposed in the water column and sediments are not captured in the cages compartment finally pcbs adsorbed to fine sediments tend to circulate more in non flood events and might not reach gammarids 4 5 contrasts in contamination sources pcbs and pahs had distinct links with pressures this can be explained by having specific sources factors of storing transfer and or different behaviors in the environment this difference in distribution of origins can also be explained by the present specific use of pah and inversely the past use of stored pcbs present nowadays in a diffuse way in the environment pahs and pcbs seemed to be linked to different pressures at multi scale respectively at local and large scales for pahs and at large scales for ipcbs these quantifications nationally in france support the study of blanchard et al 2004 showing in the paris area that pahs were linked mostly to urban runoffs and pcbs had nonpoint source origins their spatial distributions displayed urban sources from mostly industries shipping and or commercial zones according to sprovieri et al 2007 some of the results were also supported by exploratory analysis we performed on the highest contaminated sites in these analyzes sites were often close to urbanized zones landfills and industries based on our dataset punctual actions might be useful to reduce pah contamination while diffuse pcbs management is challenging due to its past use and diffuse occurrence it is also interesting to confront bioavailable pah and pcb origins to the origins of other contaminants like pharmaceuticals and metals sarkis et al 2020 studied the links of pressures with bioavailable metallic contamination in gammarids the dominant pressures were different from the ones of bioavailable pahs and pcbs for metals driving forces human activities leading to pressures kristensen 2004 like anthropogenic land use had an important link with bioavailable metallic contamination as well as pressures like industry and wastewater treatment plant density finally having a nationwide dataset of pressures and bioavailable pops for 245 sites enabled the quantification of general links between them for the first time however these results can be dependent on the gradients of the pressures and contamination of the studied measures chosen pressures provided a part of the explanation of bioavailable pah and pcb contamination thus using a bigger dataset can confirm the links between environmental pressures and bioavailable organic contamination for pahs and pcbs and can possibly highlight other links in addition to providing more explanation some dominant pressures had wide gradients e g straightness it is possible that having more measures might increase the gradient of some pressures and other links to bioavailable pops contamination might be quantified having a bigger dataset can also quantify links specific to zones with homogeneous environmental factors like sites in the same altitude or the same watercourse size for instance links can be investigated in lowland and mountain sites since sediment types and their stocking capacities are different thus sediments might be linked to pops differently quantifying the links between pressures and pops seasonally can also be explored but will imply more frequent active biomonitoring campaigns at large scale the temporal variation of pcbs and pahs can highlight releases of these contaminants in the environment and can perhaps reveal complementary links to those we unraveled in this study for freshwater management the current approach could serve as a promising basis to understand the general links between pressures and bioavailable organic contamination the sum of pahs and the sum of ipcbs are representative of each family of contaminants the application of the current approach could be adapted to investigate the links of pressures with specific pahs and pcbs moreover it might be helpful to investigate the impacts of pressures including bioavailable organic contamination on freshwater ecosystems hering et al 2015 5 conclusion to conclude in this approach for the first time the links between pressures and respectively pah and pcb bioavailable contamination were quantified with a dataset of 245 sites distributed at a large scale active biomonitoring measures took into account bioavailability of these contaminants with a fine dosage range and enabled a confrontation with pressures at the national level of france the links were quantified with structural equation modeling more specifically pls pm and the dominant pressures acting on bioavailable contamination were different between pahs and pcbs point source urban density represented by urban zones at the upstream influence scale water quality degradation characterized by nutrients and organic matter at the site scale summer precipitation at the watershed scale straightness at the reach scale and point source industry density at the upstream influence scale were linked with positive correlations with pah bioavailable contamination four pressures at the large scale of the watershed nonpoint source urban density nonpoint source industry density nonpoint source road density and watershed size were linked with positive correlations with pcb bioavailable contamination as expected the dominant pressures were different between pah local and large scale pressures and pcb large scale pressures bioavailable contamination showing quantitatively that the sources and vectors of transfer of these two families of contaminants were different these pioneer results can highlight the importance of some general pressures that can be further investigated when managing environmental pcb and pah freshwater contamination this approach can subsequently be applied on a bigger nationwide dataset to confirm the quantified links and open up new investigations on pops origins in specific types of watercourses and at specific seasons it can be used in risk evaluation to understand the links between pressures at

hydrophobicity enables them to contaminate trophic chains babut et al 2011 this happened in the rhône river in france mourier et al 2014 these organic contaminants can be present in soils of landfills amiard et al 2016 dendievel et al 2019 pahs are also ubiquitous pops well known for their atmospheric presence low vapor pressure low solubility in water ravindra et al 2008 and difficult degradation zhi et al 2015 pahs ongoing origins are atmospheric deposition from combustion bertrand et al 2015 coles et al 2012 ravindra et al 2008 urban density industrialization bertrand et al 2015 coles et al 2012 motelay massei et al 2004 and leaching from roads coles et al 2012 ravindra et al 2008 covered with coal tars degiorgi and badot 2020 water runoff from precipitation can also induce pulses of contamination in watercourses ravindra et al 2008 uher et al 2016 concentrations of pcbs and pahs were often measured in a selection of sites next to a specific source of contamination punctual measurements of contaminants are frequently below the limits of quantification and do not consider bioavailable concentrations present in biota ciliberti et al 2017 to take into account bioavailability instead of measuring contaminants in water and sediment they were dosed in biota for example in mussels in the mussel watch program kimbrough et al 2008 and in oysters and mussels in the rocch program ifremer 2008 active biomonitoring abm measures bioavailable concentrations of contaminants in transplanted organisms besse et al 2013 wepener 2013 the measures in biota enable better quantification of contaminants with low concentrations arnold et al 2021 emphasized the necessity of understanding large spatial scale contamination sources and the difficulty of considering native bioindicators meanwhile active biomonitoring generates measures of contaminants at a large spatial scale and allows a comparison of these measures ciliberti et al 2017 gammarids are dominant macroinvertebrates from the crustacean group and are ubiquitous in french freshwater besse et al 2013 they are used as active biomonitoring probes to measure bioavailable contamination because they are net accumulators of chemical substances chaumot et al 2015 bioconcentrations of pahs and pcbs in gammarids are easily measured besse et al 2013 alric et al 2019 anthropogenic pressures generated by human activities can influence on contamination craig et al 2017 e g pah and pcb of freshwater ecosystems at large scale these pressures can be sources of contamination like urban zones kaushal et al 2014 and industrial discharges steele et al 2010 they can also be factors of transfer of contaminants like hydromorphological alterations dendievel et al 2019 hydromorphological modifications can impact on sediment transfer and thus the bioavailability of organic contaminants adsorbed to the sediment brunet 2007 for instance alterations of the watercourse like modification of discharges by dams can generate deposition and remobilization of sediments on which organic pollutants are adsorbed bertrand et al 2015 dendievel et al 2019 straightening watercourses is an indicator of morphological alteration that can act on the velocity of flows and increase erosions of banks and sediment transport garcia et al 2012 eutrophication defined as a high concentration of nutrients can also influence on the bioavailability of contaminants akkanen et al 2012 chapman 2018 tao et al 2017 numerous studies started to quantify the links between pressures and biological responses dahm et al 2013 riseng et al 2011 stendera et al 2012 villeneuve et al 2018 in order to manage multiple pressures in freshwater quantifying the links between pressures and contamination is required the links between pressures and contamination are often studied at local scales for example uher et al 2016 investigated the links between anthropogenic pressures and pahs in freshwater in the seine river frissell et al 1986 highlighted the necessity of considering the hierarchy of scales when studying links between anthropogenic pressures stream functioning is studied following a hierarchy of scales allan 2004 poff 1997 because the links between parameters at a large spatial scale can be different from the ones at a local spatial scale to investigate the impact of a specific pressure the appropriate scale should be chosen nevertheless confronting pressures to pops measurements on a large scale can be challenging these measurements in water are frequently below the quantification limit of analytical methods and thus contamination data distribution can have missing low values ciliberti et al 2017 sarkis et al 2020 proposed an explanatory model to quantify the links between pressures and metallic bioavailable contamination at a large scale the current study aims to quantify at large scale the links between pressures and bioavailable organic contamination for pahs and pcbs of french watercourses we selected pressures constituted of point sources at a local scale close to the site and nonpoint sources at large scales like the watershed of contamination potential factors of transfer of contaminants as well as environmental parameters then we established a conceptual model representing each pressure via stressor indicators at its suitable scale of occurrence and considering bioavailable contamination as the final output the scales of the pressures were the watershed upstream influence reach and site scale and the scale of bioavailable organic contamination was the site scale hypotheses of links between pressures and bioavailable pah and pcb contamination were set following a structural equation model these links among pressures and the links between pressures and bioavailable contamination were quantified with partial least squares path modeling pls pm lastly the dominant links of pressures with bioavailable pah and pcb were compared at adequate spatial scales 2 material and methods 2 1 contamination data from pops regulatory surveillance via abm bioavailable concentrations data pahs and pcbs are extracted from the national database naïades gathering measurements implemented by the french regional water agencies they have been recently implementing bioconcentration measurements with transplanted gammarids abm babut et al 2020 for the wfd following the standardized protocol defined in afnor 2019 control gammarus fossarum were sampled from an uncontaminated site in france saint maurice de rémens they were acclimated in controlled conditions in the laboratory for two weeks with leaves as food body sized calibrated males were caged in watercourses for an exposition period of three weeks during non flood events sex and weight are controlled to avoid their effects on bioconcentration besse et al 2013 ciliberti et al 2017 quantification of contaminants in gammarids surviving was performed by a cofrac accredited laboratory lda26 with a minimum of 1 5 g of wet weight of gammarids per site after the exposition pops were dosed in gammarids via mass spectrometry more specifically 11 pahs anthracene benzo b j fluoranthene benzo k fluoranthene benzo g h i perylene benzo a pyrene chrysene fluoranthene fluorene naphtalene phenanthrene and pyrene and 17 pcbs pcb 28 pcb 52 pcb 77 pcb 101 pcb 105 pcb 114 pcb 118 pcb 123 pcb 126 pcb 138 pcb 149 pcb 153 pcb 156 pcb 157 pcb 167 pcb 170 and pcb 180 the 245 caging sites were distributed over the national scale of france sites in different hydroecoregions represented a diversity of landscapes with contamination measures from 2017 to 2019 fig 1 a hydroecoregion type 1 is a homogeneous zone in terms of geology relief and climate wasson et al 2002 the maximum concentration of each contaminant per site for different samplings was considered with its specific caging date the few concentrations below the limit of quantification lq were replaced by the measure of the lq divided by 2 considering sites in the nationwide french monitoring network covered a spatially contrasted range of concentrations of bioavailable pahs and pcbs 2 2 choices of pressures and stressor indicators at multiple scales and conceptual model building to associate each abm experimented site to anthropogenic pressures we first chose potential sources of pops contamination based on literature pahs may be originated from punctual industries urbanization bertrand et al 2015 coles et al 2012 motelay massei et al 2004 and roads coles et al 2012 ravindra et al 2008 while pcbs are usually diffused in urban environments due to their past use dendievel et al 2019 mourier et al 2014 to represent diffuse sources of pops in our conceptual model fig 2 we chose indicators of three possible nonpoint sources of pops nonpoint source industry density nonpoint source urban density and nonpoint source road density besides we considered four point sources point source industry density point source urban density point source road density and point source landfill density we selected five environmental parameters possibly modulating bioavailable pops contamination coarse sediment soil permeability watershed size hydrographic network density and summer precipitation we also integrated hydromorphology dams slopes and straightness as a transfer vector of pops and eutrophication nutrients and organic matter representing deteriorated water quality stressor indicators were selected based on expert knowledge and data availability to represent these pressures that can have a potential link with pops bioavailable contamination fig 2 the used spatial scales were a the site b the reach defined as a zone with homogeneous hydrographic characteristics c the upstream influence of 5 10 and 20 km represented with a buffer zone upstream of each site and d the watershed delimited for each site with a digital elevation model dem nonpoint source industry density nonpoint source urban density and nonpoint source road density coarse sediment soil permeability watershed size hydrographic network density and summer precipitation were large scale pressures at the watershed scale point source industry density point source urban density point source road density and point source landfill density were at the upstream influence of 5 10 and 20 km of each site dams slope and straightness were at the reach scale nutrients and organic matter pressure was at the site scale the pressures their stressor indicators and sources of data are detailed in table 1 for each site all stressors were calculated at their scale via geographic information system all pressures were linked to pops contamination fig 2 we supposed a positive correlation between all pressures except soil permeability and pops bioavailable contamination because these variables were sources of pops factors favorable for more pops in the watercourse or transfer factors of pops as for soil permeability we expected a negative correlation with pops bioconcentration point source landfill density point source industry density nonpoint source industry density point source road density nonpoint source road density point source urban density nonpoint source urban density dams slope and straightness were linked to nutrients and organic matter in freshwater fig 2 with an expected positive correlation these links of pressures with nutrients and organic matter contributed to the indirect links of pressures with bioavailable persistent organic contamination 2 3 statistical modeling a preliminary principal component analysis pca based on a site substance matrix gathering bioavailable contamination data was performed with xlstat 2019 more specifically on the dataset including bioconcentrations of pcbs and pahs with the sum of ipcbs and the sum of pahs the sum of ipcbs had already been used as a representative indicator of pcbs babut et al 2009 this pca investigates covariations in our dataset among pahs or pcbs and between them this analysis led to parametrize two separate models with respectively the sum of pahs and the sum of ipcbs as outputs see results the adopted statistical modeling methodology for the quantification of links defined in fig 2 was the same as villeneuve et al 2018 sarkis et al 2020 pls pm was adopted because this modeling can quantify the links between multiple pressures taking into account direct and indirect links without multicollinearity issues tenenhaus et al 2005 it is a type of structural equation modeling constituted with two sub models based on regressions fernandes 2012 vinzi et al 2010 when studying the links between pressures and pops the measurement model defines the pressures based on stressor indicators following the eq 1 y j h w jh x jh w j x j where yj is the external estimation of the pressure variable j wjh are the coefficients linking a linear combination between pressure j and stressor indicator h xjh are the stressor indicators h of pressure j wj and xj are respectively the column vectors of wjh and xjh representing each a matrix of one column with multiple elements the structural model quantifies the links between pressures based on eq 2 z j i i j cij 0 e ji y i where z j is the internal estimation of the pressure j shows that the variable on the left of this symbol is obtained by a reduction of the variable on the right of this symbol e ji is the path coefficient regression coefficient of the structural model y i is the external estimation of pressure i i i j is the condition for which i is divisible by i is different from j and cij 0 is a non nullity of coefficients fernandes 2012 the algorithm is detailed in tenenhaus et al 2005 and vinzi et al 2010 the direct link was first obtained between each two linked pressures the indirect link was based on the product of links between two pressures and an intermediate pressure the total link resulted from the sum of direct and indirect links for each pls pm model direct and indirect links between pressures and respectively the sum of pahs and the sum of ipcbs were quantified with correlation values then the total links of pressures with pops bioavailable contamination were determined in xlstat 2019 indirect links were mainly negligible due to the construction of the model the coefficient of determination r2 representing the explanation of contamination by pressures was computed significant results were determined by a jackknife method the link of each pressure with contamination was analyzed only for significant correlation values higher than 0 1 3 results 3 1 co occurrence of pcbs and pahs bioavailable contamination the pca correlation circle revealed a strong structure of correlation among pcbs and pahs bioavailable data fig 3 the f1 axis had the most explanation with 56 followed by the f2 axis with 18 a clear separation appears between all the pcbs and pahs these groups of variables being almost perpendicular are weakly correlated for each group of contaminants pcbs and pahs all the substances were correlated and respectively pahs and pcbs were correlated with the sum of pahs and the sum of ipcbs though high molecular weight pahs benzo b j fluoranthene benzo k fluoranthene benzo g h i perylene benzo a pyrene chrysene and fluoranthene were better represented than low molecular weight pahs naphtalene anthracene pyrene fluorene and phenanthrene on the pca this result confirmed having two respective models for pahs and pcbs 3 2 representativeness of pressures at multiple scales table 2 states the correlation of each stressor indicator with its specific pressure in both pls pm models the pahs sum model and ipcbs sum model when a pressure was represented by only one stressor indicator the correlation between the pressure and the stressor indicator was equal to 1 all stressor indicators represented their specific pressure non negligible values only population density at the upstream influence of 5 10 and 20 km in both models and wastewater treatment plants presence at the upstream influence of 5 10 and 20 km in the pahs sum model had low correlations with their pressures in the pahs sum model nonpoint source urban density was correlated more with surface of urban land use at the watershed than population density at the watershed and inversely in the ipcbs sum model in both models point source urban density was correlated the most with surface of urban land use at 20 km upstream of the site and correlated the least with population density at 5 km upstream of the site stressor indicators at 5 10 and 20 km were correlated differently with their pressure like for point source industry density point source urban density point source road density and point source landfill density dissolved oxygen is the only stressor indicator with a negative correlation with its specific pressure nutrients and organic matter 3 3 quantified links between pressures and bioavailable organic contamination fig 4 represents the total links between pressures and the sum of pah bioavailable contamination the r2 is equal to 0 345 meaning that 35 of pah s bioavailable contamination is explained by the selected pressures the highest positive correlation with pah bioavailable contamination was with point source urban density represented mostly by surface of urban land use 0 237 followed by nutrients and organic matter 0 205 summer precipitation 0 142 straightness 0 139 and point source industry density 0 106 no significant negative correlations of pressures with pah s bioavailable contamination were reported fig 5 represents total links between pressures and pcb bioavailable contamination r2 is equal to 0 338 meaning that 34 of pcb bioavailable contamination was explained by pressures four pressures are positively correlated with bioavailable ipcbs nonpoint source urban density 0 194 nonpoint source industry density 0 131 nonpoint source road density 0 123 and watershed size 0 110 no significant negative correlations of pressures with pcb bioavailable contamination were reported 4 discussion 4 1 pcbs and pahs distinctions according to the pca fig 3 bioavailable pcbs and pahs contaminations were poorly correlated among the experimented sites their difference can be possibly explained by having different sources and or fate in the environment that we further investigated based on our conceptual model separately for both families fig 2 jones and de voogt 1999 presented different families of pops including pahs and pcbs they share similarities in terms of hydrophobic properties adsorption to sediments kimbrough et al 2008 mourier et al 2014 toxicity persistence bioaccumulation and long range transport lohmann et al 2007 but differ in molecular structure ineris 2012 soleille and brignon 2006 and origins olenycz et al 2015 fig 3 also showed correlations between all pahs with the sum of pahs on one side and all pcbs with the sum of ipcbs on the other side supporting similarities of substances in each respective family this supports the decision of representing each family by respectively the sum of pahs and the sum of ipcbs the high molecular pahs were better represented than the low molecular pahs on the pca probably due to their higher accumulation in gammarids 4 2 representativeness of pressures at multiple scales in the current study a conceptualized model linking pressures to pops bioavailable contamination has been elaborated for the first time and applied at the national scale of france there are often accessible data of pressures with wide gradients at a large spatial scale but quantification of contamination in multiple sites with contrasted contamination levels at a large scale remains challenging the use of active biomonitoring enabled this nationwide quantification of bioavailable pops contamination this model is constituted by a selection of pressures anthropogenic pressures and natural parameters point source and or nonpoint source density of industries urban zones landfills and roads nutrients and organic matter dams slope straightness coarse sediment soil permeability watershed size hydrographic network density and summer precipitation the stressor indicators were chosen based on literature and expertise of ecotoxicologists hydroecologists hydromorphologists and hydrologists and dependent on the availability of data for all sites representing a pressure with a group of stressor indicators had the advantage of considering stressor indicators with different distributions and variable correlations with their pressure table 2 since point source urban density was mostly correlated with surface of urban land use at 5 10 and 20 km upstream of the site the link of this pressure with pahs contamination will mostly be representative of urban areas and not specifically wastewater treatment plants and population density in addition representing stressor indicators at multiple spatial scales represented complementary information on the pressure as for respectively point source industry density point source urban density point source road density and point source landfill density the more nutrients and organic matter increased the less dissolved oxygen there was hypotheses of links between pressures were used to build the conceptualized structure of the model in order to quantify total links of pressures depending on data availability other pressures and stressor indicators could be added later to the model to test other links for example only current landfills were integrated in the model as an influencing factor on deposition of pahs and pcbs but former landfills could also be considered because they are potential sources of organic contamination in waste dumping brunet 2007 in the same way not only current industries can be considered as potential sources of pahs but also past ones bertrand et al 2015 we chose to study the links between industries and pah bioavailable contamination however the links with specific types of industries like petrochemical industries could be investigated ravindra et al 2008 regarding hydrology since caging of gammarids was performed during non flood events the frequency and intensity of floods were not considered summer precipitation was considered to describe the contrast in precipitation between different sites and geographical zones we opted for summer precipitation in particular to represent the precipitation regimes of sites and discriminate more the contrasts in precipitations between different hydroclimatic zones rather than considering the annual precipitation mean storm weirs collecting rain and enhancing leaching of pollutants from soils could therefore be a complementary pressure hubaux and perceval 2011 the increased density of the hydrographic network was an indicator of possible drainage of more contaminants the choice of multiple scales enabled the study of links between pressures and bioavailable organic contamination at multiple spatial scales point source pressures were measured at the local scale of upstream influence and nonpoint source pressures were calculated at the watershed scale we hypothesized that pressures represented at different scales had different correlations with bioavailable organic contamination 4 3 the relationship of bioavailable pahs with point and nonpoint source pressures the construction of both models enabled a quantification of links between pressures and bioavailable organic contamination represented by respectively the sum of bioavailable pahs and the sum of bioavailable ipcbs the chosen pressures explained 35 of pah bioavailable contamination in our dataset four environmental pressures were positively correlated with pah bioavailable contamination the first positive correlation was point source urban density reflecting a local urban runoff link with bioavailable pah barhoumi et al 2019 found that high concentrations of pahs were detected in highly populated urban areas due to anthropogenic activities releasing these contaminants then the second positive correlation was with nutrients and organic matter it reflected potentially the situation of sites with often more nutrients and organic matter with increased pah contamination this situation can be explained by runoffs enriched with nutrients and organic matter for instance with urbanization water quality can be degraded with a co occurrence of enrichments with nutrients and organic matter as well as pollutants allan 2004 suspended particulate matter a stressor indicator of altered water quality could be adsorbed to pahs li et al 2020 and it can be a possible vector of pahs to biota the third positive correlation was with summer precipitation highlighting that pah bioconcentration is dependent on a precipitation zonation precipitations are well known to mobilize contaminants like pahs present in the atmosphere to reach the watercourse blanchard et al 2004 ollivon et al 1999 the fourth positive correlation is with straightness an indicator of straightening considered as a morphological alteration meandering rivers can induce more diverse flow and more deposits of fine sediments thus more diverse environmental conditions garcia et al 2012 and possibly more denitrification oraison et al 2011 simplifying flows and associated deposit forms often observed in straightened watercourses as well as artificial riverbanks can induce less adsorption of pahs to riverbanks and more pahs in circulation this link is highlighted but is not a very high correlation possibly due to the indicator representing a probability of watercourse physical alteration and also due to other possible sources like occurrence of roads next to straightened watercourses the fifth positive correlation with point source industry density was supported by literature bertrand et al 2015 coles et al 2012 to summarize the links of pressures with bioavailable pahs were quantified at multiple scales bioavailable pah contamination was influenced by local scale pressures as point source urban density nutrients and organic matter in the site and point source industry density and large scale pressures such as summer precipitation in the watershed as hypothesized in the conceptual model pressures considered as vectors of transfer of pahs e g summer precipitation and straightness had an important link with bioavailable pah contamination positive correlation the developed model may identify environmental drivers of contamination to manage bioavailable contamination of pahs this first study suggests that studying specific sources of pah contamination should be encouraged as well as factors of transfer 4 4 the relationship of bioavailable pcbs with nonpoint source pressures for ipcbs 34 of contamination was explained by pressures three sources of contamination nonpoint source urban density nonpoint source industry density and nonpoint source road density were positively correlated with pcb bioavailable contamination unlike pah bioavailable contamination linked with sources and factors of transfer these pressures acting mostly on ipcbs bioavailable contamination were mainly nonpoint source pressures spatially diffuse at a large scale pcbs are banned from the 80s in france and their emissions in the environment have decreased since then cire 2010 pcbs found in the environment are mostly inherited from the recent past and mobilized by vectors of transfer they are currently occurring in a diffuse way in the environment with a link to urbanization roads and industries diamond et al 2010 watershed size was also positively correlated with ipcbs bioavailable contamination highlighting the possible influence of large scale sources of ipcbs that are more numerous in big watersheds than small ones coles et al 2012 and bertrand et al 2015 declared a relationship between pops and adsorption to sediments hubaux and perceval 2011 also highlighted the link between sediments and pcbs the coarse sediment indicator aimed to represent the particle size of sediments to determine the different storage types of ipcbs from the riverbed to the floodplain and in more or less erodible geomorphic units in the current study there was no correlation between the particle size at the watershed scale and pops this could be due to differences in timings between releases of pops during sediment mobilization when there were floods and exposures of caged gammarids more measures could better evaluate this link in addition gammarids are exposed in the water column and sediments are not captured in the cages compartment finally pcbs adsorbed to fine sediments tend to circulate more in non flood events and might not reach gammarids 4 5 contrasts in contamination sources pcbs and pahs had distinct links with pressures this can be explained by having specific sources factors of storing transfer and or different behaviors in the environment this difference in distribution of origins can also be explained by the present specific use of pah and inversely the past use of stored pcbs present nowadays in a diffuse way in the environment pahs and pcbs seemed to be linked to different pressures at multi scale respectively at local and large scales for pahs and at large scales for ipcbs these quantifications nationally in france support the study of blanchard et al 2004 showing in the paris area that pahs were linked mostly to urban runoffs and pcbs had nonpoint source origins their spatial distributions displayed urban sources from mostly industries shipping and or commercial zones according to sprovieri et al 2007 some of the results were also supported by exploratory analysis we performed on the highest contaminated sites in these analyzes sites were often close to urbanized zones landfills and industries based on our dataset punctual actions might be useful to reduce pah contamination while diffuse pcbs management is challenging due to its past use and diffuse occurrence it is also interesting to confront bioavailable pah and pcb origins to the origins of other contaminants like pharmaceuticals and metals sarkis et al 2020 studied the links of pressures with bioavailable metallic contamination in gammarids the dominant pressures were different from the ones of bioavailable pahs and pcbs for metals driving forces human activities leading to pressures kristensen 2004 like anthropogenic land use had an important link with bioavailable metallic contamination as well as pressures like industry and wastewater treatment plant density finally having a nationwide dataset of pressures and bioavailable pops for 245 sites enabled the quantification of general links between them for the first time however these results can be dependent on the gradients of the pressures and contamination of the studied measures chosen pressures provided a part of the explanation of bioavailable pah and pcb contamination thus using a bigger dataset can confirm the links between environmental pressures and bioavailable organic contamination for pahs and pcbs and can possibly highlight other links in addition to providing more explanation some dominant pressures had wide gradients e g straightness it is possible that having more measures might increase the gradient of some pressures and other links to bioavailable pops contamination might be quantified having a bigger dataset can also quantify links specific to zones with homogeneous environmental factors like sites in the same altitude or the same watercourse size for instance links can be investigated in lowland and mountain sites since sediment types and their stocking capacities are different thus sediments might be linked to pops differently quantifying the links between pressures and pops seasonally can also be explored but will imply more frequent active biomonitoring campaigns at large scale the temporal variation of pcbs and pahs can highlight releases of these contaminants in the environment and can perhaps reveal complementary links to those we unraveled in this study for freshwater management the current approach could serve as a promising basis to understand the general links between pressures and bioavailable organic contamination the sum of pahs and the sum of ipcbs are representative of each family of contaminants the application of the current approach could be adapted to investigate the links of pressures with specific pahs and pcbs moreover it might be helpful to investigate the impacts of pressures including bioavailable organic contamination on freshwater ecosystems hering et al 2015 5 conclusion to conclude in this approach for the first time the links between pressures and respectively pah and pcb bioavailable contamination were quantified with a dataset of 245 sites distributed at a large scale active biomonitoring measures took into account bioavailability of these contaminants with a fine dosage range and enabled a confrontation with pressures at the national level of france the links were quantified with structural equation modeling more specifically pls pm and the dominant pressures acting on bioavailable contamination were different between pahs and pcbs point source urban density represented by urban zones at the upstream influence scale water quality degradation characterized by nutrients and organic matter at the site scale summer precipitation at the watershed scale straightness at the reach scale and point source industry density at the upstream influence scale were linked with positive correlations with pah bioavailable contamination four pressures at the large scale of the watershed nonpoint source urban density nonpoint source industry density nonpoint source road density and watershed size were linked with positive correlations with pcb bioavailable contamination as expected the dominant pressures were different between pah local and large scale pressures and pcb large scale pressures bioavailable contamination showing quantitatively that the sources and vectors of transfer of these two families of contaminants were different these pioneer results can highlight the importance of some general pressures that can be further investigated when managing environmental pcb and pah freshwater contamination this approach can subsequently be applied on a bigger nationwide dataset to confirm the quantified links and open up new investigations on pops origins in specific types of watercourses and at specific seasons it can be used in risk evaluation to understand the links between pressures at multi scale and the exposition to chemical contamination within aquatic ecosystems declaration of competing interest the authors confirm not having any competing interest the authors declare that they

16736,a new water treatment technology is presented for extending the longevity and increasing the maximal bio load of container bound lucrative live seafood transportations the technology is designed for removing ammonia and minimizing the bacterial concentration that develop in the water during the transport this paper focuses on the characteristics of self synthesized polyether sulfone pes coated zn hcf composite beads which have a high adsorbing capacity for nh4 in seawater and constitute the heart of the developed technology adsorption isotherms show that the operational capacity of the composite material pes 20 w w at nh4 concentration of 10 mgn l at 3 5 c is 3 mgn g zn hcf the kinetics of the pes coated beads were shown to be considerably slower than the bare zn hcf but since the retention time in the transport is long many days this does not detract from the effectiveness of the adsorption simulation experiments with and without live fish showed that the adsorbing material behaved as expected during a 21 d trip and that it did not have any effect on the fish repeated adsorption regeneration 3 and 6 m nacl tests proved the composite material s stability and ion exchange robustness electrooxidation of the ammonia in the exhausted regeneration solution was carried out with high efficiency and the treated solution could be used effectively in the following chemical regeneration step the cost of a treatment unit installed in a 40 foot container was estimated at 40 000 and the roi at 6 to 12 months keywords hexacyanoferrate ammonia adsorption in seawater live seafood transportation regeneration 1 introduction live seafood products make for a fast growing market in europe and north america while being a large and mature market in the far east within live seafood sea catch shows the biggest price difference between live and non live products quagrainie et al 2011 thapa et al 2015 to date live seafood commerce is mainly based on local products because of the considerable complexity associated with establishing a reliable and cost effective supply chain the seafood is transported alive from its origin wild catch or farms passes through retailers holding facilities and then transferred to the market where it is held alive until being purchased by the end customer to be successful throughout the entire supply chain the seafood needs to be maintained in both good health and at a corresponding physical form and the survival rate should be very high the weakest link in the live seafood supply chain appears to be the live shipments which are typically carried out at low temperatures typically 4 c to ensure low metabolism rate conditions and particularly when the required transfer time is longer than a couple of days air freight is always an option but a very expensive one hence when large quantities are considered the focus should be on containers transported via rail truck or sea freight in this regard the main economy related challenge is the ability to apply sufficiently high shipment bio loads high animal densities to render the operation profitable currently to maintain adequate water quality during long distance shipments the bio load is often reduced to inexpedient values which instigates marketing limitations since it invariably dictates high product prices to enable feasible intercontinental live seafood commerce new technologies should be developed to overcome the limitation of the deterioration in the water quality in the holding tanks garrett et al 2015 during the transport such techniques should address as a minimum requirement both the removal of ammonia and the minimization the microorganism population that develops in the water during the shipment harmon 2009 currently applied transportation technologies rely mostly on maintaining a low temperature and high dissolved oxygen concentration during the shipment but they do not explicitly address the removal of toxic metabolites and microorganisms as such they are suitable for shipments that last up to 48 or perhaps 72 h some advanced vivier lorries do contain co2 stripping capabilities and some even apply fine particle flotation and filtration devices but none of the currently applied technologies include ammonia removal or microbial control abilities these however are the limiting factors for increasing the shipping duration and or bio loads harmon 2009 and thereby for opening live seafood commerce to a much larger global market ben asher et al 2021 2020 recently reported on the only technology that has been so far suggested for removing ammonia and microorganisms during prolonged live seafood transportations this technology relies on the application of electrical current on the seawater that inherently contains a high cl concentration for producing cl2 aq which both oxidizes ammonia directly into n2 g and disinfects the water ben asher et al s 2021 2020 water treatment process is carried out in a batch manner in a dedicated container and the water is de chlorinated before being returned for ensuring that no chlorine residuals reach the live seafood holding tanks however due to the elaborate control that is required for applying this technology it appears best fitted for operation within recirculating aquaculture systems ben asher and lahav 2016 well boats ben asher et al 2021 holding facilities ben asher et al 2020 and other applications in which close human intervention is possible but less so for standalone containers the current work describes a new approach for treating the holding water in live seafood transportation and holding facilities which can be applied as an add on to available containers and holding facilities the approach is based on removing ammonia organic matter and bacteria from the water by applying a highly selective nh4 adsorption system which is preceded by ultrafiltration uf and followed by activated carbon filtration since the medium is seawater which contains a high na background 11 000 mg l conventional ion exchange resins or zeolites are not effective in removing nh4 jiang et al 2018 therefore metal hexacyanoferrate m ii hcf nanoparticles bound within polyethersulfone pes beads were used instead m ii hcf nanoparticles have a very high affinity toward several monovalent cations cs rb nh4 they can thus be used to separate these ions efficiently from highly saline solutions saha et al 2018 vipin et al 2014 for example jiang et al 2018 showed nh4 removal from simulative solutions in the presence of 9000 mg l of na using sodium cobalt hexacyanoferrate naxco fe cn 6 y zh2o in jiang et al s 2018 work the nano beads were shown to adsorb ammonium from both low and high salinity solutions at 4 3 mol kg an hcf lattice consisting of zn ii was demonstrated by marei et al 1986 to have a high affinity to ammonium at conditions consisting of a high k background the adsorption mechanism of hcf crystals was identified by huo et al 2021 to be a mixture of ion exchange ion trapping and a complexation interaction the voids in the cubic lattice that are surrounded by cyano bridged metals create spherical gapping that allows hydrated ammonium to be exchanged with sodium ions which are located at the center of the 3d lattice since the hydrated sodium ion is larger than the hydrated ammonium it cannot be easily exchanged back with nh4 for that to happen the na concentration should be much higher than in seawater the size and dimensions of the lattice gaps together with the internal cubic structure of the metal hexacyanoferrate crystal are the reason for the high selectivity towards nh4 rb and cs ardestani et al 2019 jiang et al 2018 that said since the rb and cs concentrations in seawater are very low these ions do not interfere with the application described in this paper in this work we chose to synthesize na zn hcf which was generated in the lab as a colloidal powder to use the material as an ion exchange resin within a flow reactor it had to be integrated into a bead like structure that has both high physical and chemical stabilities along with a relatively high porosity that would have a minimal effect as possible on the ion exchange kinetics wang et al 2018 the literature cites quite a few materials that can be used for encapsulating hcf such as poly vinil alcohol lai et al 2016 alginates lai et al 2016 silica monolith cabaud et al 2019 silica particles massoni et al 2020 chitosan polyacrylonitrile and more wang et al 2018 in this work polyether sulfone pes which is characterized by good thermal stability and mechanical properties and is stable at a wide ph range tsehaye et al 2018 was used as the encapsulating material 2 description of the suggested technology the suggested process described schematically in fig 1 consists of a reactor filled with pes zn hcf composite beads located downstream to a uf membrane module the uf membrane is applied to remove microorganisms and suspended organic matter larger than 1000 dalton a common uf membrane used for rejecting most types of microorganisms including bacteria zooplankton protozoa etc excluding viruses from the recirculating stream with the aim of both protecting the beads from microbial biofouling and reducing the organic matter and the microbial loads in the seafood holding tanks although seafood transportation is performed at low temperatures normally 3 5 c the development of microbial biofilms on the coated hcf is inevitable after a short while and should be minimized high organic matter concentration and the resulting high microbial load in the seafood tanks lead to quick deterioration of the water quality in the holding tanks leading further to a decline in the seafood health condition and eventually to low survival rates ben asher et al 2020 the uf component is operated to maintain a low microbial load and low organic matter concentration in the holding tanks by separating them continuously from the recirculating water since the system is required to operate at zero water discharge the uf filter should be designed in excess such that it will not clog and thus will not require back washing during the shipment period an activated carbon filter is located downstream the metal hcf column for reducing the total organic carbon and by that contributing to the maintenance of low microbial load in the holding tanks water by the end of each shipment the exhausted beads undergo nh4 desorption with a highly concentrated 3 to 6 m nacl solution which restores the nh4 adsorption capacity thereby allowing for multiple cycle use the desorption of nh4 from m ii hcf was addressed by parajuli et al 2016 who reported on 95 regeneration efficiency upon using 1 m kcl solution the stability of the adsorption material used in this work for multi cycle use is addressed at the end of this paper to improve the adsorption efficiency of nh4 on the zn hcf the process design allows the tan concentration in the seafood tanks to increase during the transport to up to 10 mgn l however since nh3 is the more toxic of the two ammonia species a ph controller is applied such that the ph is maintained via strong acid addition at around neutrality to shift the ammonia system towards nh4 thereby not allowing the nonionic ammonia nh3 concentration to exceed 0 05 mgn l it is emphasized that an optimal ph and tan concentration values should be defined separately for each seafood species and that the system would be designed in a flexible manner to accommodate a large range of operational setpoints this work presents a conceptual proof of concept of the new in situ ammonia removal treatment unit that aims at bridging the technological gap that exists in the operation of prolonged live seafood transportations and zero discharge holding facilities the main goal of the paper is to validate the use of the novel pes zn hcf composite beads as the key element in the new concept the pes zn hcf composite beads were synthesized and tested for nh4 adsorption capacity and kinetic properties desorption capabilities and the optimal zn hcf pes weight ratio within the beads to our knowledge no data is available in the literature on the capacity and kinetics of hcf in general and pes zn hcf composite beads in particular at the nh4 concentration range between 0 and 100 mgn l the design of the water treatment unit and its efficiency was then tested with seawater and a warm seawater fish species sparus aurata the paper is concluded with a general design in which the weight volume and power demand of the treatment system are evaluated in the context of a 40 foot container transportation system 3 materials and methods 3 1 fabrication of the pes zn hcf composite beads the zn hcf powder was prepared following a procedure from takahashi et al 2016 two solutions of zncl2 and k4 fe cn 6 3h2o of 0 5 molar were mixed at a respective 3 2 ratio the slurry was then centrifuged and rinsed five times with deionized water diw then dried at 60 c for 24 h which was followed by grinding and sieving mesh 35 the resulting powder is denoted zn hcf in the following text pes basf ultrason e grade 6020p flakes were mixed with an n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp solvent at a ratio of 1 5 66 and left overnight to fully dissolve the solution was then mixed with the zn hcf powder at three weight ratios 66 33 and 20 of pes w w the production of the composite material was done by controlled precipitation of the pes using a room temperature aqueous bath and a

produced composite beads were left overnight in diw and then followed by heating them to 60 c in fresh diw for 10 h to remove the remaining solvent 3 2 pes zn hcf composite beads and powder

respectively bergmann and machado 2015 langmuir 1919 r 2 parameter was used to compare the model results with a target value nearest to unity 3 2 2 regeneration stability tests two sets of adsorption regeneration experiments were performed for assessing the reuse potential of the pes zn hcf composite beads batch tests ten cycles were performed each consisting of three replicates of 0 25 g zn hcf powder coated with pes dispersed in a 50 ml of seawater with an initial nh4 concentration of 100 mgn l after 24 h the tan concentration was measured and the zn hcf beads were inserted into a 50 ml of 3 m nacl solution the extracted nh4 was measured again after 24 h and the beads were subjected to another adsorption cycle the beads were washed with diw after each step the capacity of the pes zn hcf composite beads was calculated using eq 1 after each adsorption step the water temperature was kept at 25 c using a water bath flowthrough tests a pvc column filled with 28 g of zn hcf in the form of composite pes coated beads weight ratio 20 was used five cycles were performed each consisting of three steps 1 adsorption sw with a tan concentration of 16 mgn l 10 6 l 2 chemical regeneration 6 m

ammonia from step 2 was oxidized to n2 g by means of indirect ammonia oxidation gendel and lahav 2012 to a tan concentration tending towards zero indirect ammonia electrooxidation is an energy efficient ammonia oxidation process that is mediated by cl2 a species which is generated via the electrooxidation of cl present in the water at the end of the electrochemical step the residual chlorine was reduced by a strong reducing agent thiosulphate and the solution was maintained for 48 h to ensure complete removal of residual chlorine prior to being re contacted with the pes zn hcf

seawater at 4 c with two nh4 daily mass doses intended to simulative two brown crab bio loads 150 and 320 kg m3 denoted simulations 1 and 2 respectively simulations 1 and 2 were conducted using two sealed containers holding 3 00 and 1 29 l of seawater respectively inorganic carbon ct was partially removed from the seawater by hcl addition and aeration prior to the experiments for minimizing ph variations during the experiments ph was set at 6 90 nh4cl was added daily 4 50 and 4 25 mgn in simulations 1 and 2 respectively to mimic the average ammonia that is known to be excreted at the selected brown crab bio loads the pes zn hcf composite beads were held in 0 3 l pvc columns and the solution was recirculating 15 ml min through them and back to the holding containers simulation 1 a two column setup was tested 1 a column with 28 gzn hcf in the form of pes zn hcf composite beads 50 weight ratio and 2 a column with beads containing only pes with a similar mass simulation 2 a three column setup was tested 1 a column with 28 gzn hcf in the form of pes zn hcf composite beads 50 weight ratio and 2 a column with 28 gzn hcf in the form of pes zn hcf composite beads 20 weight ratio and 3 a column with beads containing only pes with a similar mass simulation 2 also consisted of a control i e a sealed bottled that underwent the same treatment as the other containers but without recycling the water through an nh4 adsorption column 3 4 21 day experiment with live seabream fish 3 4 1 experimental setup two 100 l tanks were filled with 50 l of seawater both tanks consisted of aeration and a ph control system thermo alpha 190 controllers connected to a prominent gamma metering pump for acid dosage h2so4 0 25 n tank 1 termed test in this section was recirculated hrt 0 2 l h using a cole parmer peristaltic pump through a column filled with 105 g zn hcf in the form of pes zn hcf composite beads a 55 µm disc filter was located upstream to the zn hcf column the control tank

following 48 h of acclimation of the fish to the test conditions salinity and temperature the fish were fed twice a day using raanan fish feed 45 protein according to 0 8 of their body weight 3 g d to simulate an ammonia excretion rate that is equivalent to 270 kg m3 of european brown crab or 150 kg m3 of arctic char under holding transportation conditions starvation at 4 c ben asher et al 2021

using the standard methods colorimetric method rice et al 2017 4 results and discussion 4 1 adsorption material characterization 4 1 1 adsorption isotherms and kinetics fig 2 shows the isotherms obtained from 48 h nh4 seawater adsorption experiments conducted with the zn hcf composites pes weight 20 at 3 5 and 25 c shown also on fig 2 are langmuir fitted model lines the calculated r 2 for the langmuir model fitness was higher than the freundlich isotherm model with values 0 985 see table a 1 the mechanism of adsorption in the zn hcf crystal lattice correlates well with the langmuir model theory being a reversible mono layer based adsorption desorption process wang and guo 2020 from the langmuir model a maximal capacity of 38 7 and 26 5 mgn gzn hcf was predicted at 3 5 c and 25 c respectively the higher adsorption capacity of the zn hcf at the lower temperature is likely attributed to the exothermic nature h 0 rosseinsky et al 2004 of the cations adsorption onto the zn hcf crystal s lattice the maximal capacity predicted by the langmuir model lies within the range of values reported in marei et al 1986 2 28 meq gzn hcf or 31 92 mgn gzn hcf and also of the theoretical value predicted for the fabricated zn hcf crystal k1 98zn2 94 ii fe ii cn 6 2 6 2h2o using the crystal molar mass as the base for the capacity calculations as suggested by takahashi et al 2016 mw 804 8 g mol maximal capacity of exchangeable cations of 2 46 meq gzn hcf or 34 4 mgn gzn hcf the results of the kinetic experiments are presented in fig 3 the 33 and 20 composites were able to reach the capacity of the non covered zn hcf powder after 51 h 99 while the 66 composite reached 89 of the non pes covered zn hcf powder after 51 h and would have likely also reached the same capacity had the experiment been continued for another day or so in the graph the black horizontal line represents the capacity of the non pes covered powder using the final equilibrium concentration from the kinetic experiments and plugging it into the langmuir model equation see table a 1 from the results of the current characterization section the followings can be concluded 1 the produced zn hcf crystal has adsorption properties similar to equivalent materials reported in the literature 2 the encapsulation of the zn hcf crystal in the pes polymer slows down the kinetics of the adsorption for all the tested weight ratios but the adsorption capacity is not significantly affected even at the high pes to zn hcf mass ratios that were tested 3 lower temperatures favor nh4 adsorption and 4 the adsorption kinetics despite being slow relative to common ion exchange operations are adequate for the developed process which is operated in a batch manner for a long time period up to 21 days 4 1 2 adsorption regeneration stability of the composite pes zn hcf beads the difference in the affinities between nh4 and na was found to be 400 results not shown therefore a 3 m na solution was used to extract the nh4 out of the zn hcf along with a high regeneration solution volume no difference was found in the regeneration efficiency between 6 and 3 m na results not shown fig 4 shows the results obtained from 10 consecutive adsorption regeneration batch cycles the results indicate that after 10 cycles of chemical regeneration the capacity of the composite beads remained within the range of 9 8 0 7 mg g practically meaning that the capacity of the material remained constant a slightly higher capacity was recorded in the first adsorption cycle when the composite material was new which is a common observation with pristine ion exchange materials levchuk et al 2018 the results of the flowthrough tests table 1 showed a high regeneration efficiency with a relative low average error in the mass balance calculations of the adsorption regeneration tests indicating complete regeneration of the composite beads over the 5 tested cycles the ammonia electrochemical oxidation step was able to reduce the nh4 concentration in the regeneration solution to below 0 2 mgn l in each of the cycles a clear indication that at the end of this step the regeneration solution was ready to be used efficiently in the next desorption cycle these experiments led to the following conclusions 1 the pes zn hcf composite beads showed good stability and high regeneration ability at both high and low ammonia concentrations and with 3 and 6 m nacl regeneration solutions 2 the electrochemical reutilizing of the regeneration solution was shown to be highly effective 4 1 3 21 day non live simulation experiments these experiments were conducted to simulate the ammonia that would be excreted by two high bio loads of brown crab for a prolonged trip and to assess the capability of the adsorbing material to maintain the accumulated tan concentration at below 10 mgn l at the end of the trip the daily nh4 addition in the two 21 day simulation runs was 1 50 and 3 29 mgn l d simulation 1 and 2 respectively as shown in fig 5 in accordance with the experiments design the tan concentration in the runs in which the water was recycled through a reactor filled with pes zn hcf composite beads was maintained below 10 mgn l in contrast the tan concentration in the control and theoretical curves simulation 1 and 2 fig 5a b went up to 31 and 64 mgn l respectively the pes surface area was responsible for 15 of the tan removal along the entire 21 days results are shown only for simulation 2 the zn2 ion concentrations at the water tank were measured in simulation 2 all the concentrations were stable and below the acute toxicity of zn2 to fish and shrimp in seawater barbieri and doi 2011 bielmyer et al 2012 with average values of 0 13 0 72 and 0 61 mg l in the control 50 and 20 pes weight ratio runs respectively the fact that zn2 did not leach indicates a stable zn hcf structure during the simulations the temperature was kept at 3 7 c and the ph was set at 6 9 both remained stable throughout the runs these experiments prove that the composite material can be used to repress the accumulation of the tan concentration in the holding water in a very effective way 4 2 21 day experiments with live seabream fish the amount of pes zn hcf composite beads that was applied in this experiment was calculated such as to not reach acute nh3 toxicity at ph 7 0 at the end of the 21 holding days and in parallel to allow the nh4 concentration to accumulate to up to 40 mgn l the goal was to both test the well being of the fish in the presence of the adsorbing material and also to validate the adsorption isotherm at a wide range of nh4 pseudo equilibrium concentrations at more realistic conditions due to the presence of the live fish in the system and the longer retention times both the test and the control showed 100 fish survival good appetite and normal swimming behavior were observed during the entire test in either run suggestive of good animal welfare as shown in fig 6 at the end of the 21 days the tan concentration reached 53 and 36 mgn l and the nh3 concentration was 0 11 and 0 08 mgn l in the control and test tanks respectively which is within the recommended range for seabream aquaculture ben asher and lahav 2016 do was maintained at 7 mg l and co2 at 10 mgco2 l in both tanks throughout the experiment s period ph was set at 7 3 until day 13 and then reduced to 7 0 in both tanks for maintaining the nh3 concentration below the toxicity level for seabream the zn2 concentration was stable at 0 19 0 02 mg l from day 7 which is below the defined toxicity of this ion to aquatic animals in seawater due to the use of warm sea fish the water temperature applied in the seabream experiment 18 c was significantly higher than the temperature applied in cold water seafood transportations which is 3 5 c for minimizing the animals metabolism rate and obtaining conditions supporting their hibernation as a result of the low temperature operation the microbial load is expected to be reduced by a factor of 2 tchobanoglous et al 2014 relative to the relatively high bacterial yield that was observed in these experiments the relatively high temperature 18 c and the pre filtration 55 µm filter and not uf as suggested in fig 1 that were used in this experiment exposed the composite material to harsher conditions with regard to biofilm development during the experiment in comparison to the conditions that are expected during the live seafood transportations nevertheless fig 7 shows that these conditions did not affect the adsorbing capacity of the pes zn hcf composite beads in fact the capacity observed in the 21 day live test showed an improved adsorbing capacity relative to the results predicted by the isotherm fig 2 48 h probably due to the fact that the exposure times were much higher than 48 h the pes zn hcf composite beads were regenerated with a 3 m nacl solution at the end of the 21 day experiment 94 of the nh4 was desorbed according to the ammonia concentration that accumulated in the control tank the concentrations of nitrite and nitrate in the tanks showed no evidence of the occurrence of nitrification throughout the 21 days five beads that were cut into slices for examination under a microscope magnitude x100 showed no evidence of biofouling on the surface of the beads and inside the inner pores results not shown 4 3 treatment system footprint and weight for designing a treatment system for a 40 foot container that is intended to be shipped the volume and weight demand of the system are significant factors the payload capacity of a 40 reefer cannot exceed 28 tons hence the systems weight should be reduced to a minimum for allowing a maximal bio load per shipment the calculations presented in this section assume a total brown crab bio load of 5750 kg i e 250 kg m3 in 18 m3 of holding water for a 21 day shipment resulting in an overall release of 1250 gn to the water the maximal tan concentration allowed to accumulate in brown crab transports is 10 mgn l therefore the design parameter for the adsorbing material is 2 2 mgn gzn hcf with a safety factor of 20 see fig 2 and table a 1 which results in a requirement of 580 kg of the composite material and a net volume of 1150 l the recirculating flow rate through the treatment system was calculated for replacing the water in the seafood tanks twice a day 2 m3 h for attaining the required microorganisms removal rate by the uf both the pre filtration and the uf components were calculated for operating throughout the entire shipment without a backflush resulting in a relatively large pre filtration system 2 spin klintm gallaxy requiring 1 0 5 0 8 m3 lxwxd and 100 kg weight and two uf modules 10 requiring 2 5 0 25 0 5 m3 lxwxd and 200 kg of weight per unit the activated carbon component was calculated with an hrt of 6 min resulting in a 200 l ac column enabling adsorption of 2 5 kg of organic carbon in total the system weight was estimated at 1850 kg including filling water piping and the pump the total electrical power demand on board the container was estimated at 5 kw for the recirculating pump 5 bar and the ph control system resulting in operation expenses of 12 per day the capital cost of such a unit is estimated at 40 000 out of which the chemicals for the synthesis of the composite material amount to 5000 10 kg beads based on the experience of the authors with various ion exchange resins and the fact that the composite beads remained unscathed after 10 operational cycles we estimate that a battery of the composite material is expected to last up to 100 cycles approximately ten years with a very low if any physical and chemical deterioration due to the high stability of both the polymer and the zn hcf in the composite material and the efficient regeneration capability since the regeneration of the adsorbing material is not performed on board the unit requires regeneration replacement services that were estimated at 500 per transport when summing all the costs including the footprint a system that is utilized for leveraging the technology s advantages is expected to return its investment in 6 to 12 months 5 conclusions a new treatment system is presented whose aim is to control the ammonia and bacterial concentrations that develop in the holding water during long transports of high density live seafood species at low temperature this paper focused on the synthesis and characterization of a stable composite material made of zn hcf crystal bound by polyether sulfone as an efficient adsorbing material of nh4 from seawater the results show that both the capacity and nh4 adsorption kinetics are adequate for the proposed aim 580 kg of pes coated 20 zn hcf are required to disallow the nh4 concentration to exceed 10 mgn l during a 21 d trip 3 5 c in which the ammonia excreted in the transport of 5750 kg of brown crab 250 kg m3 the material was tested also in an experiment with live seawater fish seabream at 18 c and was shown to adsorb nh4 in a capacity that slightly exceeded the projection from the adsorption isotherms due to the longer retention time the stability of the adsorbing composite material was tested in two adsorption regeneration experiments that were run for multiple cycles and showed no loss at all in the adsorption capacity or in physical appearance the regeneration solution was shown to undergo efficient indirect ammonia electrooxidation by passing the solution through an electrolyzer by which a part of the high cl ion concentration is oxidized to cl2 aq which in turn oxidized the ammonia to benign n2 g the capex and opex related to installing and operating the treatment system in one 40 foot container were calculated and the roi was estimated to be less that one year depending on the number of trips and the value of the transported merchandize the next step is to test the full technology including the uf and ac units on a lucrative live seawater species for 21 days at a high bio density the successful implementation of this technology has the potential to open new markets for live seafood species that are currently restricted to local markets due to transportation challenges it also has the potential of considerably reducing the cost of some species that so far have been transported only by air freight and hence marketed at very high prices the results of this study support the supposition that hcfs have the potential to become an integral part of nh4 removal from wastewater streams e g anerobic liquor supernatant municipal solid waste leachate saline water wastewaters etc the major advantage of using hcfs in this context apart from the very high affinity to nh4 is the fact that they practically adsorb only nh4 and will thus not be affected by other cations that are present in the solution i e ca2 mg2 k na etc this phenomenon combined with the fact that nh4 can be efficiently electrooxidized from the nacl regeneration solution to n2 g allows reusing the regeneration solution for many cycles without losing adsorption efficiency the major drawback on the other hand is the relatively slow kinetics that is not hindering in the application presented in this paper but which will result in relatively large reactors when attempting to treat wastewater steams declaration of

16736,a new water treatment technology is presented for extending the longevity and increasing the maximal bio load of container bound lucrative live seafood transportations the technology is designed for removing ammonia and minimizing the bacterial concentration that develop in the water during the transport this paper focuses on the characteristics of self synthesized polyether sulfone pes coated zn hcf composite beads which have a high adsorbing capacity for nh4 in seawater and constitute the heart of the developed technology adsorption isotherms show that the operational capacity of the composite material pes 20 w w at nh4 concentration of 10 mgn l at 3 5 c is 3 mgn g zn hcf the kinetics of the pes coated beads were shown to be considerably slower than the bare zn hcf but since the retention time in the transport is long many days this does not detract from the effectiveness of the adsorption simulation experiments with and without live fish showed that the adsorbing material behaved as expected during a 21 d trip and that it did not have any effect on the fish repeated adsorption regeneration 3 and 6 m nacl tests proved the composite material s stability and ion exchange robustness electrooxidation of the ammonia in the exhausted regeneration solution was carried out with high efficiency and the treated solution could be used effectively in the following chemical regeneration step the cost of a treatment unit installed in a 40 foot container was estimated at 40 000 and the roi at 6 to 12 months keywords hexacyanoferrate ammonia adsorption in seawater live seafood transportation regeneration 1 introduction live seafood products make for a fast growing market in europe and north america while being a large and mature market in the far east within live seafood sea catch shows the biggest price difference between live and non live products quagrainie et al 2011 thapa et al 2015 to date live seafood commerce is mainly based on local products because of the considerable complexity associated with establishing a reliable and cost effective supply chain the seafood is transported alive from its origin wild catch or farms passes through retailers holding facilities and then transferred to the market where it is held alive until being purchased by the end customer to be successful throughout the entire supply chain the seafood needs to be maintained in both good health and at a corresponding physical form and the survival rate should be very high the weakest link in the live seafood supply chain appears to be the live shipments which are typically carried out at low temperatures typically 4 c to ensure low metabolism rate conditions and particularly when the required transfer time is longer than a couple of days air freight is always an option but a very expensive one hence when large quantities are considered the focus should be on containers transported via rail truck or sea freight in this regard the main economy related challenge is the ability to apply sufficiently high shipment bio loads high animal densities to render the operation profitable currently to maintain adequate water quality during long distance shipments the bio load is often reduced to inexpedient values which instigates marketing limitations since it invariably dictates high product prices to enable feasible intercontinental live seafood commerce new technologies should be developed to overcome the limitation of the deterioration in the water quality in the holding tanks garrett et al 2015 during the transport such techniques should address as a minimum requirement both the removal of ammonia and the minimization the microorganism population that develops in the water during the shipment harmon 2009 currently applied transportation technologies rely mostly on maintaining a low temperature and high dissolved oxygen concentration during the shipment but they do not explicitly address the removal of toxic metabolites and microorganisms as such they are suitable for shipments that last up to 48 or perhaps 72 h some advanced vivier lorries do contain co2 stripping capabilities and some even apply fine particle flotation and filtration devices but none of the currently applied technologies include ammonia removal or microbial control abilities these however are the limiting factors for increasing the shipping duration and or bio loads harmon 2009 and thereby for opening live seafood commerce to a much larger global market ben asher et al 2021 2020 recently reported on the only technology that has been so far suggested for removing ammonia and microorganisms during prolonged live seafood transportations this technology relies on the application of electrical current on the seawater that inherently contains a high cl concentration for producing cl2 aq which both oxidizes ammonia directly into n2 g and disinfects the water ben asher et al s 2021 2020 water treatment process is carried out in a batch manner in a dedicated container and the water is de chlorinated before being returned for ensuring that no chlorine residuals reach the live seafood holding tanks however due to the elaborate control that is required for applying this technology it appears best fitted for operation within recirculating aquaculture systems ben asher and lahav 2016 well boats ben asher et al 2021 holding facilities ben asher et al 2020 and other applications in which close human intervention is possible but less so for standalone containers the current work describes a new approach for treating the holding water in live seafood transportation and holding facilities which can be applied as an add on to available containers and holding facilities the approach is based on removing ammonia organic matter and bacteria from the water by applying a highly selective nh4 adsorption system which is preceded by ultrafiltration uf and followed by activated carbon filtration since the medium is seawater which contains a high na background 11 000 mg l conventional ion exchange resins or zeolites are not effective in removing nh4 jiang et al 2018 therefore metal hexacyanoferrate m ii hcf nanoparticles bound within polyethersulfone pes beads were used instead m ii hcf nanoparticles have a very high affinity toward several monovalent cations cs rb nh4 they can thus be used to separate these ions efficiently from highly saline solutions saha et al 2018 vipin et al 2014 for example jiang et al 2018 showed nh4 removal from simulative solutions in the presence of 9000 mg l of na using sodium cobalt hexacyanoferrate naxco fe cn 6 y zh2o in jiang et al s 2018 work the nano beads were shown to adsorb ammonium from both low and high salinity solutions at 4 3 mol kg an hcf lattice consisting of zn ii was demonstrated by marei et al 1986 to have a high affinity to ammonium at conditions consisting of a high k background the adsorption mechanism of hcf crystals was identified by huo et al 2021 to be a mixture of ion exchange ion trapping and a complexation interaction the voids in the cubic lattice that are surrounded by cyano bridged metals create spherical gapping that allows hydrated ammonium to be exchanged with sodium ions which are located at the center of the 3d lattice since the hydrated sodium ion is larger than the hydrated ammonium it cannot be easily exchanged back with nh4 for that to happen the na concentration should be much higher than in seawater the size and dimensions of the lattice gaps together with the internal cubic structure of the metal hexacyanoferrate crystal are the reason for the high selectivity towards nh4 rb and cs ardestani et al 2019 jiang et al 2018 that said since the rb and cs concentrations in seawater are very low these ions do not interfere with the application described in this paper in this work we chose to synthesize na zn hcf which was generated in the lab as a colloidal powder to use the material as an ion exchange resin within a flow reactor it had to be integrated into a bead like structure that has both high physical and chemical stabilities along with a relatively high porosity that would have a minimal effect as possible on the ion exchange kinetics wang et al 2018 the literature cites quite a few materials that can be used for encapsulating hcf such as poly vinil alcohol lai et al 2016 alginates lai et al 2016 silica monolith cabaud et al 2019 silica particles massoni et al 2020 chitosan polyacrylonitrile and more wang et al 2018 in this work polyether sulfone pes which is characterized by good thermal stability and mechanical properties and is stable at a wide ph range tsehaye et al 2018 was used as the encapsulating material 2 description of the suggested technology the suggested process described schematically in fig 1 consists of a reactor filled with pes zn hcf composite beads located downstream to a uf membrane module the uf membrane is applied to remove microorganisms and suspended organic matter larger than 1000 dalton a common uf membrane used for rejecting most types of microorganisms including bacteria zooplankton protozoa etc excluding viruses from the recirculating stream with the aim of both protecting the beads from microbial biofouling and reducing the organic matter and the microbial loads in the seafood holding tanks although seafood transportation is performed at low temperatures normally 3 5 c the development of microbial biofilms on the coated hcf is inevitable after a short while and should be minimized high organic matter concentration and the resulting high microbial load in the seafood tanks lead to quick deterioration of the water quality in the holding tanks leading further to a decline in the seafood health condition and eventually to low survival rates ben asher et al 2020 the uf component is operated to maintain a low microbial load and low organic matter concentration in the holding tanks by separating them continuously from the recirculating water since the system is required to operate at zero water discharge the uf filter should be designed in excess such that it will not clog and thus will not require back washing during the shipment period an activated carbon filter is located downstream the metal hcf column for reducing the total organic carbon and by that contributing to the maintenance of low microbial load in the holding tanks water by the end of each shipment the exhausted beads undergo nh4 desorption with a highly concentrated 3 to 6 m nacl solution which restores the nh4 adsorption capacity thereby allowing for multiple cycle use the desorption of nh4 from m ii hcf was addressed by parajuli et al 2016 who reported on 95 regeneration efficiency upon using 1 m kcl solution the stability of the adsorption material used in this work for multi cycle use is addressed at the end of this paper to improve the adsorption efficiency of nh4 on the zn hcf the process design allows the tan concentration in the seafood tanks to increase during the transport to up to 10 mgn l however since nh3 is the more toxic of the two ammonia species a ph controller is applied such that the ph is maintained via strong acid addition at around neutrality to shift the ammonia system towards nh4 thereby not allowing the nonionic ammonia nh3 concentration to exceed 0 05 mgn l it is emphasized that an optimal ph and tan concentration values should be defined separately for each seafood species and that the system would be designed in a flexible manner to accommodate a large range of operational setpoints this work presents a conceptual proof of concept of the new in situ ammonia removal treatment unit that aims at bridging the technological gap that exists in the operation of prolonged live seafood transportations and zero discharge holding facilities the main goal of the paper is to validate the use of the novel pes zn hcf composite beads as the key element in the new concept the pes zn hcf composite beads were synthesized and tested for nh4 adsorption capacity and kinetic properties desorption capabilities and the optimal zn hcf pes weight ratio within the beads to our knowledge no data is available in the literature on the capacity and kinetics of hcf in general and pes zn hcf composite beads in particular at the nh4 concentration range between 0 and 100 mgn l the design of the water treatment unit and its efficiency was then tested with seawater and a warm seawater fish species sparus aurata the paper is concluded with a general design in which the weight volume and power demand of the treatment system are evaluated in the context of a 40 foot container transportation system 3 materials and methods 3 1 fabrication of the pes zn hcf composite beads the zn hcf powder was prepared following a procedure from takahashi et al 2016 two solutions of zncl2 and k4 fe cn 6 3h2o of 0 5 molar were mixed at a respective 3 2 ratio the slurry was then centrifuged and rinsed five times with deionized water diw then dried at 60 c for 24 h which was followed by grinding and sieving mesh 35 the resulting powder is denoted zn hcf in the following text pes basf ultrason e grade 6020p flakes were mixed with an n methyl 2 pyrrolidone nmp solvent at a ratio of 1 5 66 and left overnight to fully dissolve the solution was then mixed with the zn hcf powder at three weight ratios 66 33 and 20 of pes w w the production of the composite material was done by controlled precipitation of the pes using a room temperature aqueous bath and a

produced composite beads were left overnight in diw and then followed by heating them to 60 c in fresh diw for 10 h to remove the remaining solvent 3 2 pes zn hcf composite beads and powder

respectively bergmann and machado 2015 langmuir 1919 r 2 parameter was used to compare the model results with a target value nearest to unity 3 2 2 regeneration stability tests two sets of adsorption regeneration experiments were performed for assessing the reuse potential of the pes zn hcf composite beads batch tests ten cycles were performed each consisting of three replicates of 0 25 g zn hcf powder coated with pes dispersed in a 50 ml of seawater with an initial nh4 concentration of 100 mgn l after 24 h the tan concentration was measured and the zn hcf beads were inserted into a 50 ml of 3 m nacl solution the extracted nh4 was measured again after 24 h and the beads were subjected to another adsorption cycle the beads were washed with diw after each step the capacity of the pes zn hcf composite beads was calculated using eq 1 after each adsorption step the water temperature was kept at 25 c using a water bath flowthrough tests a pvc column filled with 28 g of zn hcf in the form of composite pes coated beads weight ratio 20 was used five cycles were performed each consisting of three steps 1 adsorption sw with a tan concentration of 16 mgn l 10 6 l 2 chemical regeneration 6 m nacl solution 12 5 l and 3 electrochemical ammonia oxidation from the regeneration solution the solution was circulated through an electrolyzer klorogen m40 electrolyzer v 2 4 v and the discharged ammonia from step 2 was oxidized to n2 g by means of indirect ammonia oxidation gendel and lahav 2012 to a tan concentration tending towards zero indirect ammonia electrooxidation is an energy efficient ammonia oxidation process that is mediated by cl2 a species which is generated via the electrooxidation of cl present in the water at the end of the electrochemical step the residual chlorine was reduced by a strong reducing agent thiosulphate and the solution was maintained for 48 h to ensure complete removal of residual chlorine prior to being re contacted with the pes zn hcf

seawater at 4 c with two nh4 daily mass doses intended to simulative two brown crab bio loads 150 and 320 kg m3 denoted simulations 1 and 2 respectively simulations 1 and 2 were conducted using two sealed containers holding 3 00 and 1 29 l of seawater respectively inorganic carbon ct was partially removed from the seawater by hcl addition and aeration prior to the experiments for minimizing ph variations during the experiments ph was set at 6 90 nh4cl was added daily 4 50 and 4 25 mgn in simulations 1 and 2 respectively to mimic the average ammonia that is known to be excreted at the selected brown crab bio loads the pes zn hcf composite beads were held in 0 3 l pvc columns and the solution was recirculating 15 ml min through them and back to the holding containers simulation 1 a two column setup was tested 1 a column with 28 gzn hcf in the form of pes zn hcf composite beads 50 weight ratio and 2 a column with beads containing only pes with a similar mass simulation 2 a three column setup was tested 1 a column with 28 gzn hcf in the form of pes zn hcf composite beads 50 weight ratio and 2 a column with 28 gzn hcf in the form of pes zn hcf composite beads 20 weight ratio and 3 a column with beads containing only pes with a similar mass simulation 2 also consisted of a control i e a sealed bottled that underwent the same treatment as the other containers but without recycling the water through an nh4 adsorption column 3 4 21 day experiment with live seabream fish 3 4 1 experimental setup two 100 l tanks were filled with 50 l of seawater both tanks consisted of aeration and a ph control system thermo alpha 190 controllers connected to a prominent gamma metering pump for acid dosage h2so4 0 25 n tank 1 termed test in this section was recirculated hrt 0 2 l h using a cole parmer peristaltic pump through a column filled with 105 g zn hcf in the form of pes zn hcf composite beads a 55 µm disc filter was located upstream to the zn hcf column the control tank

using the standard methods colorimetric method rice et al 2017 4 results and discussion 4 1 adsorption material characterization 4 1 1 adsorption isotherms and kinetics fig 2 shows the isotherms obtained from 48 h nh4 seawater adsorption experiments conducted with the zn hcf composites pes weight 20 at 3 5 and 25 c shown also on fig 2 are langmuir fitted model lines the calculated r 2 for the langmuir model fitness was higher than the freundlich isotherm model with values 0 985 see table a 1 the mechanism of adsorption in the zn hcf crystal lattice correlates well with the langmuir model theory being a reversible mono layer based adsorption desorption process wang and guo 2020 from the langmuir model a maximal capacity of 38 7 and 26 5 mgn gzn hcf was predicted at 3 5 c and 25 c respectively the higher adsorption capacity of the zn hcf at the lower temperature is likely attributed to the exothermic nature h 0 rosseinsky et al 2004 of the cations adsorption onto the zn hcf crystal s lattice the maximal capacity predicted by the langmuir model lies within the range of values reported in marei et al 1986 2 28 meq gzn hcf or 31 92 mgn gzn hcf and also of the theoretical value predicted for the fabricated zn hcf crystal k1 98zn2 94 ii fe ii cn 6 2 6 2h2o using the crystal molar mass as the base for the capacity calculations as suggested by takahashi et al 2016 mw 804 8 g mol maximal capacity of exchangeable cations of 2 46 meq gzn hcf or 34 4 mgn gzn hcf the results of the kinetic experiments are presented in fig 3 the 33 and 20 composites were able to reach the capacity of the non covered zn hcf powder after 51 h 99 while the 66 composite reached 89 of the non pes covered zn hcf powder after 51 h and would have likely also reached the same capacity had the experiment been continued for another day or so in the graph the black horizontal line represents the capacity of the non pes covered powder using the final equilibrium concentration from the kinetic experiments and plugging it into the langmuir model equation see table a 1 from the results of the current characterization section the followings can be concluded 1 the produced zn hcf crystal has adsorption properties similar to equivalent materials reported in the literature 2 the encapsulation of the zn hcf crystal in the pes polymer slows down the kinetics of the adsorption for all the tested weight ratios but the adsorption capacity is not significantly affected even at the high pes to zn hcf mass ratios that were tested 3 lower temperatures favor nh4 adsorption and 4 the adsorption kinetics despite being slow relative to common ion exchange operations are adequate for the developed process which is operated in a batch manner for a long time period up to 21 days 4 1 2 adsorption regeneration stability of the composite pes zn hcf beads the difference in the affinities between nh4 and na was found to be 400 results not shown therefore a 3 m na solution was used to extract the nh4 out of the zn hcf along with a high regeneration solution volume no difference was found in the regeneration efficiency between 6 and 3 m na results not shown fig 4 shows the results obtained from 10 consecutive adsorption regeneration batch cycles the results indicate that after 10 cycles of chemical regeneration the capacity of the composite beads remained within the range of 9 8 0 7 mg g practically meaning that the capacity of the material remained constant a slightly higher capacity was recorded in the first adsorption cycle when the composite material was new which is a common observation with pristine ion exchange materials levchuk et al 2018 the results of the flowthrough tests table 1 showed a high regeneration efficiency with a relative low average error in the mass balance calculations of the adsorption regeneration tests indicating complete regeneration of the composite beads over the 5 tested cycles the ammonia electrochemical oxidation step was able to reduce the nh4 concentration in the regeneration solution to below 0 2 mgn l in each of the cycles a clear indication that at the end of this step the regeneration solution was ready to be used efficiently in the next desorption cycle these experiments led to the following conclusions 1 the pes zn hcf composite beads showed good stability and high regeneration ability at both high and low ammonia concentrations and with 3 and 6 m nacl regeneration solutions 2 the electrochemical reutilizing of the regeneration solution was shown to be highly effective 4 1 3 21 day non live simulation experiments these experiments were conducted to simulate the ammonia that would be excreted by two high bio loads of brown crab for a prolonged trip and to assess the capability of the adsorbing material to maintain the accumulated tan concentration at below 10 mgn l at the end of the trip the daily nh4 addition in the two 21 day simulation runs was 1 50 and 3 29 mgn l d simulation 1 and 2 respectively as shown in fig 5 in accordance with the experiments design the tan concentration in the runs in which the water was recycled through a reactor filled with pes zn hcf composite beads was maintained below 10 mgn l in contrast the tan concentration in the control and theoretical curves simulation 1 and 2 fig 5a b went up to 31 and 64 mgn l respectively the pes surface area was responsible for 15 of the tan removal along the entire 21 days results are shown only for simulation 2 the zn2 ion concentrations at the water tank were measured in simulation 2 all the concentrations were stable and below the acute toxicity of zn2 to fish and shrimp in seawater barbieri and doi 2011 bielmyer et al 2012 with average values of 0 13 0 72 and 0 61 mg l in the control 50 and 20 pes weight ratio runs respectively the fact that zn2 did not leach indicates a stable zn hcf structure during the simulations the temperature was kept at 3 7 c and the ph was set at 6 9 both remained stable throughout the runs these experiments prove that the composite material can be used to repress the accumulation of the tan concentration in the holding water in a very effective way 4 2 21 day experiments with live seabream fish the amount of pes zn hcf composite beads that was applied in this experiment was calculated such as to not reach acute nh3 toxicity at ph 7 0 at the end of the 21 holding days and in parallel to allow the nh4 concentration to accumulate to up to 40 mgn l the goal was to both test the well being of the fish in the presence of the adsorbing material and also to validate the adsorption isotherm at a wide range of nh4 pseudo equilibrium concentrations at more realistic conditions due to the presence of the live fish in the system and the longer retention times both the test and the control showed 100 fish survival good appetite and normal swimming behavior were observed during the entire test in either run suggestive of good animal welfare as shown in fig 6 at the end of the 21 days the tan concentration reached 53 and 36 mgn l and the nh3 concentration was 0 11 and 0 08 mgn l in the control and test tanks respectively which is within the recommended range for seabream aquaculture ben asher and lahav 2016 do was maintained at 7 mg l and co2 at 10 mgco2 l in both tanks throughout the experiment s period ph was set at 7 3 until day 13 and then reduced to 7 0 in both tanks for maintaining the nh3 concentration below the toxicity level for seabream the zn2 concentration was stable at 0 19 0 02 mg l from day 7 which is below the defined toxicity of this ion to aquatic animals in seawater due to the use of warm sea fish the water temperature applied in the seabream experiment 18 c was significantly higher than the temperature applied in cold water seafood transportations which is 3 5 c for minimizing the animals metabolism rate and obtaining conditions supporting their hibernation as a result of the low temperature operation the microbial load is expected to be reduced by a factor of 2 tchobanoglous et al 2014 relative to the relatively high bacterial yield that was observed in these experiments the relatively high temperature 18 c and the pre filtration 55 µm filter and not uf as suggested in fig 1 that were used in this experiment exposed the composite material to harsher conditions with regard to biofilm development during the experiment in comparison to the conditions that are expected during the live seafood transportations nevertheless fig 7 shows that these conditions did not affect the adsorbing capacity of the pes zn hcf composite beads in fact the capacity observed in the 21 day live test showed an improved adsorbing capacity relative to the results predicted by the isotherm fig 2 48 h probably due to the fact that the exposure times were much higher than 48 h the pes zn hcf composite beads were regenerated with a 3 m nacl solution at the end of the 21 day experiment 94 of the nh4 was desorbed according to the ammonia concentration that accumulated in the control tank the concentrations of nitrite and nitrate in the tanks showed no evidence of the occurrence of nitrification throughout the 21 days five beads that were cut into slices for examination under a microscope magnitude x100 showed no evidence of biofouling on the surface of the beads and inside the inner pores results not shown 4 3 treatment system footprint and weight for designing a treatment system for a 40 foot container that is intended to be shipped the volume and weight demand of the system are significant factors the payload capacity of a 40 reefer cannot exceed 28 tons hence the systems weight should be reduced to a minimum for allowing a maximal bio load per shipment the calculations presented in this section assume a total brown crab bio load of 5750 kg i e 250 kg m3 in 18 m3 of holding water for a 21 day shipment resulting in an overall release of 1250 gn to the water the maximal tan concentration allowed to accumulate in brown crab transports is 10 mgn l therefore the design parameter for the adsorbing material is 2 2 mgn gzn hcf with a safety factor of 20 see fig 2 and table a 1 which results in a requirement of 580 kg of the composite material and a net volume of 1150 l the recirculating flow rate through the treatment system was calculated for replacing the water in the seafood tanks twice a day 2 m3 h for attaining the required microorganisms removal rate by the uf both the pre filtration and the uf components were calculated for operating throughout the entire shipment without a backflush resulting in a relatively large pre filtration system 2 spin klintm gallaxy requiring 1 0 5 0 8 m3 lxwxd and 100 kg weight and two uf modules 10 requiring 2 5 0 25 0 5 m3 lxwxd and 200 kg of weight per unit the activated carbon component was calculated with an hrt of 6 min resulting in a 200 l ac column enabling adsorption of 2 5 kg of organic carbon in total the system weight was estimated at 1850 kg including filling water piping and the pump the total electrical power demand on board the container was estimated at 5 kw for the recirculating pump 5 bar and the ph control system resulting in operation expenses of 12 per day the capital cost of such a unit is estimated at 40 000 out of which the chemicals for the synthesis of the composite material amount to 5000 10 kg beads based on the experience of the authors with various ion exchange resins and the fact that the composite beads remained unscathed after 10 operational cycles we estimate that a battery of the composite material is expected to last up to 100 cycles approximately ten years with a very low if any physical and chemical deterioration due to the high stability of both the polymer and the zn hcf in the composite material and the efficient regeneration capability since the regeneration of the adsorbing material is not performed on board the unit requires regeneration replacement services that were estimated at 500 per transport when summing all the costs including the footprint a system that is utilized for leveraging the technology s advantages is expected to return its investment in 6 to 12 months 5 conclusions a new treatment system is presented whose aim is to control the ammonia and bacterial concentrations that develop in the holding water during long transports of high density live seafood species at low temperature this paper focused on the synthesis and characterization of a stable composite material made of zn hcf crystal bound by polyether sulfone as an efficient adsorbing material of nh4 from seawater the results show that both the capacity and nh4 adsorption kinetics are adequate for the proposed aim 580 kg of pes coated 20 zn hcf are required to disallow the nh4 concentration to exceed 10 mgn l during a 21 d trip 3 5 c in which the ammonia excreted in the transport of 5750 kg of brown crab 250 kg m3 the material was tested also in an experiment with live seawater fish seabream at 18 c and was shown to adsorb nh4 in a capacity that slightly exceeded the projection from the adsorption isotherms due to the longer retention time the stability of the adsorbing composite material was tested in two adsorption regeneration experiments that were run for multiple cycles and showed no loss at all in the adsorption capacity or in physical appearance the regeneration solution was shown to undergo efficient indirect ammonia electrooxidation by passing the solution through an electrolyzer by which a part of the high cl ion concentration is oxidized to cl2 aq which in turn oxidized the ammonia to benign n2 g the capex and opex related to installing and operating the treatment system in one 40 foot container were calculated and the roi was estimated to be less that one year depending on the number of trips and the value of the transported merchandize the next step is to test the full technology including the uf and ac units on a lucrative live seawater species for 21 days at a high bio density the successful implementation of this technology has the potential to open new markets for live seafood species that are currently restricted to local markets due to transportation challenges it also has the potential of considerably reducing the cost of some species that so far have been transported only by air freight and hence marketed at very high prices the results of this study support the supposition that hcfs have the potential to become an integral part of nh4 removal from wastewater streams e g anerobic liquor supernatant municipal solid waste leachate saline water wastewaters etc the major advantage of using hcfs in this context apart from the very high affinity to nh4 is the fact that they practically adsorb only nh4 and will thus not be affected by other cations that are present in the solution i e ca2 mg2 k na etc this phenomenon combined with the fact that nh4 can be efficiently electrooxidized from the nacl regeneration solution to n2 g allows reusing the regeneration solution for many cycles without losing adsorption efficiency the major drawback on the other hand is the relatively slow kinetics that is not hindering in the application presented in this paper but which will result in relatively large reactors when attempting to treat wastewater steams declaration of

16737,liquid sludge often contains odorous and toxic hydrogen sulfide and high levels of feii compounds e g iron sulfides due to the extensive use of iron salts for hydrogen sulfide control in sewers and for enhanced primary treatment and phosphate removal in wastewater treatment plants we proposed and verified that dosing appropriate chemical oxidants in the sulfide iron laden sludge can be a simple and cost effective strategy to remove hydrogen sulfide phosphate and emerging organic contaminants and to improve sludge dewaterability simultaneously among the seven oxidants investigated h2o2 clo2 and naclo2 were the more cost effective oxidants than others to control hydrogen sulfide release from the liquid sludge dosing these three oxidants also improved sludge dewaterability and removed dissolved phosphate from the liquid sludge with h2o2 performing the best hydrogen sulfide was removed via both direct oxidation by the dosed oxidants and indirect oxidation by the feiii that was in

dewatering yan et al 2018 zhang et al 2008 can be emitted from sludge and cause obnoxious odor nuisance and pose potential health risks to workers and nearby residents sun et al 2020 yin et al 2018 zhang et al 2008 the release of phosphate from the sludge phase into the liquid phase is another concern gutierrez et al 2010 oehmen et al 2007 because the phosphate rich filtrate concentrate is often returned to the mainstream after sludge dewatering which increases the phosphate loading of the mainstream sewage treatment processes smolders et al 1996 for example sludge digestion and retention under anaerobic conditions lead to the release of phosphate from phosphate accumulating organisms which uptake phosphate during biological phosphorus removal processes oehmen et al 2007 when ferric salts are used for the enhanced chemical phosphate removal ferric phosphate precipitates are formed and co settled with sludge the decomposition of ferric phosphate precipitates in the sludge under anaerobic conditions also causes liberation of phosphate due to chemical and biological iron reduction blöcher et al 2012 furthermore emerging organic contaminants e g carbamazepine and ibuprofen which are often accumulated in sludge can be also released during sludge storage and digestion carballa et al 2007 another issue of concern in sludge treatment is the difficulty in sludge dewatering due to the rigid structures of extracellular polymeric substances epss present in sludge flocs water bound to the sludge flocs is difficult to be removed during the conventional dewatering treatment e g filtration and centrifugation liu et al 2010 sheng and yu 2006 the poor sludge dewaterability is associated with the high energy consumption of dewatering and limits the further disposal e g incineration and landfill and recycling e g biofuel and construction materials of the dewatered sludge christensen et al 2015 neyens and baeyens 2003 sludge pretreatment to destruct epss and release tightly bound water improves sludge dewaterability to et al 2016 zeng et al 2019a zeng et al 2019b solutions to each of the four abovementioned concerns in sludge treatment have been reported in the literature the hydrogen sulfide generated in the liquid sludge can be eliminated by dosing chemical oxidants gutierrez et al 2008 zhang et al 2008 however the dosed oxidants may be competitively consumed by reducing compounds e g iron sulfides that are often present in the sludge and their cost effectiveness based on the properties of the sludge requires further investigation the widely practiced strategies to remove the phosphate in sewage and the filtrate return flow from the sludge treatment include chemical precipitation by ferric salts and adsorption by iron oxides barca et al 2012 gutierrez et al 2010 however the addition of iron salts and iron oxides increases the cost of the sludge treatment the refractory emerging organic contaminants can be destructed by advanced oxidation processes such as fenton process and uv hydrogen peroxide uv h2o2 process the sludge pretreatment by oxidation e g ultrasound conditioning electrolysis and fenton process and hydrothermal processes has been used to destruct sludge epss and improve the sludge dewaterability jensen et al 2014 liu et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 however the high energy and chemical consumption limit the applications of these pretreatment methods furthermore the combined implementation of them involves the installation of a series of complex treatment units and requires high capital investments and chemical consumption therefore it is desirable to formulate a simple and cost effective strategy to remove hydrogen sulfide phosphate and emerging organic contaminants in the liquid sludge and to improve its dewaterability simultaneously for the treatment of a liquid sludge containing both hydrogen sulfide and feii compounds referred to as sulfide iron laden liquid sludge dosing certain chemical oxidants may be a simple and cost effective strategy to achieve the four purposes simultaneously besides hydrogen sulfide the liquid sludge often contains feii compounds e g feii sulfides and feii hydr oxides at high concentrations 20 200 mg fe g tss because iron salts are widely used in sewers for sulfide control and in wwtps for the enhanced removal of suspended solids and phosphate from sewage ahmed et al 2020 likosova et al 2014 wilfert et al 2016 by dosing chemical oxidants to control hydrogen sulfide the feii compounds in the liquid sludge can be also oxidized and converted into ferric iron feiii gutierrez et al 2010 sun et al 2014 the in situ generated feiii is anticipated to precipitate phosphate in the liquid sludge yuan et al 2012 furthermore fenton fenton like reactions of feii salts and zero valent iron with certain oxidants e g h2o2 and persulfate are known to generate highly reactive species such as hydroxyl radicals ho and sulfate radicals so4 which would destruct emerging organic pollutants the sludge epss and improve the dewaterability of sludge zhou et al 2014 zhou et al 2015 such fenton like reactions can also take place between the dosed chemical oxidants and the feii compounds available in the iron laden liquid sludge however these hypothetically multiple functions of the chemical oxidants in treating the sulfide iron laden liquid sludge have never been investigated in the literature and demand further investigation to elucidate the complicated oxidant feii interactions that influence the four functions this study thus aimed to select cost effective oxidants and evaluate the multiple functions of the selected oxidants in treating the sulfide iron laden liquid sludge the cost effectiveness of seven oxidants for hydrogen sulfide removal in the real sludge samples was compared the removal of dissolved phosphate the degradation of emerging organic pollutants and the liquid sludge and the improvement of the sludge dewaterability with the addition of the selected oxidants were evaluated the chemical interactions of the dosed chemical oxidants with the feii compounds were also explored 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and

permanganate kmno4 nah2po4 and na2hpo4 were purchased from sigma aldrich unless otherwise specified all solutions were prepared by dissolving the powders or diluting the solutions using the deionized water 18 2 mω cm generated from a water purification system cascada pall corporation the solutions were stored at 4 c in the dark and brought back to room temperature of 22 1 c before use the liquid sludge samples were collected from a wastewater treatment plant stonecutters island sewage treatment works scistw in hong kong the domestic sewage at scistw was treated via chemically enhanced primary treatment using ferric chloride 15 mg l as fe and polyelectrolyte 0 5 mg l as coagulants zeng et al 2020 most of the dosed iron was accumulated in the liquid sludge in the sedimentation tanks the liquid sludge collected from the bottom of the sedimentation tanks was stored in the holding tanks for about 4 h before dewatering hydrogen sulfide was generated during the sludge storage under anaerobic conditions the liquid sludge samples collected at scistw were the typical sulfide iron laden sludge and high levels of 47 90 26 mg s l feii compounds 158 31 mg fe l and dissolved phosphate 96 6 mg p l were detected which were similar to a sludge sample taken from a sludge storage tank at liede wwtp guangzhou that treats freshwater wastewater table s1 2 2 experimental procedures 2 2 1 sludge pre incubation to restore the activity of srb the liquid sludge samples stored at 4 c were homogenized and pre incubated in a 5 l sealed bottle placed in a water bath at 32 c before each test during pre incubation aliquots of the sludge samples were taken out periodically and subjected to the analysis of dissolved hydrogen sulfide concentration the pre incubation was completed when the dissolved sulfide concentration of the sludge samples reached approximately 50 mg s l which was the average sulfide concentration in the liquid sludge recorded at scistw in the summer period 2 2 2 evaluation of hydrogen sulfide removal from the liquid sludge by oxidant dosing tests were conducted using a batch reactor system fig s1 to evaluate the removal of hydrogen sulfide from the liquid sludge by seven oxidants including naclo2 clo2 h2o2 kmno4 na2s2o8 naocl and na2co3 1 5h2o aliquots of the oxidant stock solutions were spiked into the 500 ml sealed glass reactors containing 250 ml pre incubated sludge samples to reach different predetermined oxidant dosages table s2 the reactors were then sealed and placed in a water bath of 32 c and the mixtures were then thoroughly blended using a magnetic stirrer for 4 h at the fixed time intervals aliquots of sludge samples were collected using a syringe and subjected to measurement of the concentrations of dissolved hydrogen sulfide at the same time intervals gas samples in the headspace of the reactor were purged with 2 l n2 gas into a gas bag and the gaseous h2s concentrations were analyzed using a h2s gas analyzer odalog type l2 a control test without the addition of any oxidant was also conducted tests were conducted in parallel in a similar manner to obtain samples for evaluation of the oxidation products of aqueous hydrogen sulfide by the selected oxidants i e h2o2 clo2 and clo2 after the 4 h of incubation 2 2 3 evaluation of changes in sludge dewaterability and phosphate removal from sludge with oxidant dosing tests were conducted in a similar manner as described in section 2 2 2 to evaluate the sludge dewaterability and phosphate removal in the liquid sludge samples with or without h2o2 clo2 and clo2 dosing at their optimal dosages for hydrogen sulfide control after 4 h of incubation sludge samples were collected and divided into five portions one portion was subjected to the analysis of dewaterability and one portion was subjected to the analysis of particle size distribution one portion of the sludge samples was filtered through 0 45 µm membrane filters and subjected to the characterization of the epss one portion was used for the measurement of total and dissolved phosphate concentrations another portion was freeze dried after being washed by deoxygenated deionized water the dried samples were characterized to examine the surface properties of the sludge 2 2 4 evaluation of reactive species generation and emerging organic contaminant degradation induced by interactions of selected oxidants with feii supplementary tests were performed in a similar manner as described in section 2 2 2 to probe the generation of radicals from the interactions of selected oxidants with feii compounds in the sulfide iron laden liquid sludge benzoic acid ba was added as a radical probe compound which was highly reactive towards ho k 5 9 109 m 1s 1 buxton et al 1988 zhao et al 2021a samples were withdrawn at predetermined time intervals filtered and analyzed for the remaining concentrations of ba the concentrations of iron species e g feiii and feii and sulfur species e g sulfide sulfate thiosulfate before and after reacting with oxidants were measured to identify the formation of ho from the reactions of iron sulfide fes with h2o2 100 mm 5 5 dimethyl pyrroline n oxide dmpo solution was spiked into the reactor and the solution samples were collected and subjected to the analysis of electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectra the degradation of emerging organic contaminants i e carbamazepine caffeine and ibuprofen induced by the interactions of selected oxidants with feii was also evaluated 2 3 analytical methods and statistical analysis the analytical methods are described in detail in text s1 all experiments were conducted in duplicate the data were expressed as mean standard deviation of the two parallel experiments statistical significance p 0 05 was evaluated by one way analysis of variance anova on origin 8 0 software 2 4 chemical cost estimation to compare the cost effectiveness of chemical oxidants used in this study the chemical costs to treat 1 m3 of liquid sludge m usd m3 sludge were estimated based on the optimal oxidant dosages to achieve the desired control targets h2s gas concentration 5 ppm and dissolved sulfide concentration 0 5 mg l eq 1 1 m d p η 10 6 where d is the optimal oxidant dosage determined mg l p is the unit price of 1 ton of the commercial oxidant product usd ton which was based on alibaba international prices in 2020 alibaba com η is the concentration of the oxidant in the corresponding commercial product 3 results and discussion 3 1 control of hydrogen sulfide from liquid sludge by oxidant dosing 3 1 1 efficiencies and cost effectiveness of seven oxidants the efficiencies and cost effectiveness of the seven oxidants for the control of hydrogen sulfide release from the sulfide iron laden liquid sludge were evaluated to select the cost effective oxidants in real engineering practice seven oxidants including naclo2 clo2 h2o2 kmno4 na2s2o8 na2co3 1 5h2o2 and naocl at different dosages were dosed in the batch reactors fig s1 with the real liquid sludge samples the changes in the concentrations of dissolved hydrogen sulfide in the liquid sludge and gaseous h2s in the headspace of the reactors are shown in fig s3 and fig s4 respectively the seven oxidants effectively removed the dissolved hydrogen sulfide in the liquid sludge and suppressed the release of h2s gas for example the concentration of dissolved hydrogen sulfide in the sludge was below 0 5 mg s l and h2s gas concentration was lower than 5 ppm within 4 h when 800 mg l naclo2 was dosed fig s3a and fig s4a the corresponding optimal oxidant dosages which achieved the desired hydrogen sulfide control performance i e h2s gas 5 ppm and h2s liquid 0 5 mg s l within 4 h were operationally defined and are summarized in table 1 it is worth noticing that the optimal dosages of clo2 and h2o2 were 400 and 500 mg l respectively which were much lower than those of the other five oxidants tested the ph values of the sludge samples did not change significantly after the addition of h2o2 clo2 and naclo2 fig s5 while orp increased from about 200 mv to 50 mv above fig s6 the significant orp elevation was expected to prevent the formation of hydrogen sulfide during the prolonged storage because the activity of srb can be inhibited at an orp of 50 mv or above peng et al 2020 zhang et al 2008 in real practice chemical oxidants in the solutions can be automatically dosed in the liquid sludge through a pump and the extensive input of labor force and the installation of complicated facilities can be minimized the costs of oxidant dosing mainly involved the chemical consumption the chemical costs of the seven oxidants to treat 1 m3 of the liquid sludge at their optimal dosages were estimated according to the unit prices of industrial grade products quoted from alibaba com table s3 as shown in table 1 the chemical costs of dosing h2o2 clo2 and naclo2 were 0 34 1 17 and 1 38 usd m3 sludge respectively while that of na2s2o8 was up to 3 93 usd m3 sludge aeration which is often used for the control of hydrogen sulfide in wastewater and sludge was also performed as a comparison text s2 and text s3 as shown in fig s7 the h2s gas concentration in the gas outlet of the reactor gradually decreased to less than 5 ppm after 90 min aeration at an air flow rate of 0 9 l air min l sludge the concentration of dissolved hydrogen sulfide also decreased to 0 2 mg s l after 4 h aeration fig s8 however the strong stripping effect induced by aeration caused the significant release of h2s gas up to 300 ppm within 20 min which would require additional treatment of h2s gas in addition the energy cost of aeration was estimated to be 5 68 usd m3 sludge which was 3 12 15 7 times higher than the chemical costs of dosing h2o2 clo2 and naclo2 the results demonstrate that dosing selected oxidants i e h2o2 clo2 and naclo2 can be a promising and cost effective approach for the control of hydrogen sulfide in the liquid sludge 3 1 2 mechanisms of oxidation of hydrogen sulfide by oxidants and in situ formed feiii hydrogen sulfide in the sulfide iron laden liquid sludge can be oxidized by the dosed oxidants and by the feiii in situ formed from the oxidation of feii compounds present in the liquid sludge the sulfur containing products of hydrogen sulfide oxidation by clo2 naclo2 and h2o2 at various oxidant to sulfide molar ratios were evaluated as shown in fig s9 the major sulfur containing products of hydrogen sulfide oxidation by clo2 were sulfite and sulfate i e 82 1 98 9 in total while elemental sulfur sulfite and sulfate became the major sulfur products i e 91 3 100 in total by naclo2 and h2o2 the reactions of hydrogen sulfide with the three oxidants can be described using eqs 2 9 cadena and peters 1988 hoffmann 1977 the stoichiometry suggests that the dosages of the three oxidants were higher than the theoretical oxidant demands i e around 50 mg s l to oxidize hydrogen sulfide in the sludge the electron accepting capacities of 400 mg l clo2 800 mg l naclo2 and 500 mg l h2o2 were comparable i e 29 41 35 38 mm electron which were higher than electron donating capacity of 50 mg s l hydrogen sulfide in the liquid sludge i e 3 13 12 51 mm electron table s4 the results indicated that a portion of the dosed oxidants should be competitively consumed by feii compounds in the sulfide iron laden liquid sludge 2 6 cl o 2 5 h 2 s 3 h 2 o 5 s o 3 2 6 c l 16 h 3 8 cl o 2 5 h 2 s 4 h 2 o 5 s o 4 2 8 c l 18 h 4 3 cl o 2 2 h 2 s 2 s o 3 2 3 c l 4 h 5 cl o 2 2 h 2 s 2 s 0 c l 2

and the in situ formation of feiii can also contribute to the removal of hydrogen sulfide fig 1 shows that the concentration of feii present in the raw sludge was up to 158 mg fe l which was mainly in form of fes i e 70 8 the xps spectra also confirm the presence of abundant fes at 713 6 ev fig 2 siriwardane and cook 1985 after the treatment with clo2 naclo2 and h2o2 feii concentrations decreased to 129 93 and 65 mg fe l sludge respectively and the feiii concentration increased from 42 mg fe l to 71 107 and 135 mg fe l sludge accordingly fig 1 mainly due to the oxidation of fes eq 10 the trends observed were consistent with the peak shifts in the xps spectra fig 2 the in situ formed feiii and its hydrolysis product fe oh 3 eq 11 was expected to further remove hydrogen sulfide via oxidation and precipitation eqs 12 14 it should be noted that the formed fe oh 3 in the solid formed would retain in the dewatered sludge after dewatering and serve as a prolonged reagent for hydrogen sulfide control during the sludge storage and transportation sun et al 2014 sun et al 2019 10 fes cl o 2 nacl o 2 h 2 o 2 f e 3 s 0 s o 3 2 s o 4 2 11 f e 3 3 h 2 o fe oh 3 3 h 12 2 f e 3 h 2 s 2 f e

the sulfide iron laden liquid sludge on the sludge dewaterability was also investigated clo2 naclo2 and h2o2 which were more cost effective for the hydrogen sulfide control than the other four oxidants were dosed in the liquid sludge at their optimal dosages the cst values of the sludge before and after the treatment by 400 mg l clo2 800 mg l naclo2 and 500 mg l h2o2 for 4 h are shown in table 2 the cst of the raw sludge sample was 260 11 s which was within the range 50 400 s of the sludge samples from municipal wastewater reported in the literature chen et al 1996 scholz 2005 the cst values of the sludge decreased to 208 3 176 5 and 108 6 s respectively after 4 h treatment with clo2 naclo2 and h2o2 which were 20 32 and 59 lower than the control without oxidant dosing p 0 05 the enhancement in the sludge dewaterability induced by clo2 naclo2 and h2o2 was likely attributed to the destruction of epss by oxidants and radicals formed from the fenton like reactions of the dosed oxidants with the feii compounds present in the sulfide iron laden liquid sludge sheng et al 2010 xu et al 2013 the enhancement in the sludge dewaterability induced by the oxidant dosing in the sulfide iron laden liquid sludge can facilitate the sludge treatment and disposal practice the energy consumption of sludge dewatering via filtration and centrifuge was expected to reduce due to the improvement in the sludge dewaterability qi et al 2011 yin et al 2020a furthermore the better sludge dewaterability will also increase the solid content of the dewatered sludge based on the empirical model proposed by a previous study wu et al 2020 the decrease in cst values i e 20 32 and 59 induced by the addition of clo2 naclo2 and h2o2 would increase the solid content of sludge by 18 29 and 49 respectively the elevated solid content of the dewatered sludge will bring significant benefits to the disposal and recycling of the dewatered sludge such as saving transportation costs and landfill volume reducing energy consumption required by sludge incineration and better quality for recycling e g construction materials and biochar wang et al 2017 zhao et al 2021b the destruction of the sludge epss that was likely induced by oxidants and reactive species formed from fenton like reactions between feii compounds and oxidants was anticipated to be one important contributor to the enhancement in the sludge dewaterability the rigid structures of epss which are mainly composed of polysaccharides and proteins tightly bound water with the sludge flocs and lead to the poor dewaterability of the liquid sludge sheng et al 2010 the eem spectra fig 3 a show that the epss extracted from the raw sludge samples mainly contained soluble microbial by product like moieties λem 320 nm λex 280 nm aromatic proteins λem 310 nm λex 220 nm and fluvic acid like moieties λem 500 nm λex 240 nm after 4 h treatment by clo2 and naclo2 the intensity of soluble microbial by product like moieties fulvic acid like moieties and aromatic proteins all decreased fig 3b and fig 3c which was due to the destruction of sludge epss by clo2 and naclo2 lin et al 2012 song et al 2020 interestingly nearly no obvious peak was detected after the treatment by h2o2 fig 3d the more significant destruction of epss by h2o2 than clo2 and naclo2 was likely due to the involvement of radicals considering that the oxidative capability of h2o2 was lower than those of clo2 and naclo2 table s4 the destruction of the sludge epss liberated the tightly bound water and caused the fragmentation of the sludge flocs which thus enhanced the sludge dewaterability this was well supported by the pronounced shifts in the particle size distribution of the sludge flocs fig s10 the mean particle size d50 of the sludge particles decreased from 1467 µm to 23 48 and 107 µm after the treatment by h2o2 naclo2 and clo2 respectively 3 3 degradation of emerging organic contaminants in liquid sludge by oxidant dosing besides hydrogen sulfide emerging organic contaminants which are often present in sewage and partially accumulate in the sludge carballa et al 2007 can also be degraded by oxidant dosing in the sulfide iron laden liquid sludge as shown in fig 4 concentrations of the three selected emerging organic contaminants kept decreasing over time in the simulated liquid sludge system containing hydrogen sulfide fes and h2o2 carbamazepine ibuprofen and caffeine were degraded by 58 21 and 16 respectively after 5 min the degradation percentages were expected to increase with increasing reaction time the tested emerging organic contaminants were barely removed by fes alone h2o2 alone or s2 alone their degradation was hypothesized to be attributed to the reactive species e g ho generated in the systems 3 4 mechanisms of reactive species formation from fenton like reactions of oxidants and feii compounds 3 4 1 identification of reactive species the enhanced destruction of sludge epss and emerging organic contaminants can be attributable to the in situ formation of reactive species from fenton like reactions between feii compounds mainly fes and the oxidants dosed in the sulfide iron laden liquid sludge the reactive species in situ formed were identified ho that are in situ generated from the fenton like reactions of feii compounds mainly fes with h2o2 were hypothesized to be an important reactive species benzoic acid ba which is highly reactive towards ho k 5 9 109 m 1 s 1 but hardly reacts with h2o2 or fes alone was selected as a probe to demonstrate the generation of ho in the system containing hydrogen sulfide fes and h2o2 buxton et al 1988 as shown in fig 5 a ba was rapidly degraded only in the h2s fes h2o2 system while its degradation was completely inhibited in the presence of tert butanol tba which is a scavenger to ho k 6 0 108 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 the epr spectra also show the distinct characteristic peaks of dmpo ho relative intensities of 1 2 2 1 spin adducts in the reaction systems fig 5b the results confirmed that ho was generated from the fenton like reactions of h2o2 with fes present in the sulfide iron laden liquid sludge at a slightly acidic ph 5 3 6 3 eq 15 15 f e ii h 2 o 2 f e iii ho o h besides ho ferryl ion feiv which is highly reactive towards many organic compounds can also be generated from the reaction between ferrous ion fe2 and h2o2 eq 16 and contribute to the degradation of emerging organic contaminants in the simulated liquid sludge system containing hydrogen sulfide fes and h2o2 to verify whether feiv was involved in the system quenching experiments were conducted to further confirm the involvement of feiv using tba and pmso as the quenchers tba reacts rapidly with ho k 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 but slowly with feiv k 6 0 101 m 1 s 1 table s5 buxton et al 1988 neta et al 1977 and it is used as the quencher to ho only pmso reacts rapidly with both ho k 3 61 108 m 1 s 1 but slowly with feiv k 1 23 105 m 1 s 1 table s5 buxton et al 1988 neta et al 1977 and it is used as the quencher to both ho and feiv as shown in fig s11 the presence of high concentrations of tba and pmso both inhibited the degradation of benzoic acid significantly however the inhibitory effect was comparable by using the two quenchers the results suggest that the formation of feiv was minor in the liquid sludge system containing hydrogen sulfide fes and h2o2 due to the acidic conditions ph 5 5 and ho was the major contributor to the enhanced destruction of sludge epss and emerging organic contaminants 16 f e 2 h 2 o 2 f e iv o 2 h 2 o ho was more reactive than the oxidants e g h2o2 clo2 and chlorine toward the polysaccharides and proteins of the sludge epss neyens et al 2004 yu et al 2019 which largely improved the sludge dewaterability ho can also degrade refractory organic pollutants by radical addition and h abstraction reactions 3 4 2 enhanced ho formation by hydrogen sulfide and sludge epss the matrix components in the liquid sludge including dissolved sulfide and sludge epss are anticipated to affect the radical generation in the fenton like reactions fig s12a shows that the presence of hydrogen sulfide enhanced the degradation of ba significantly the results suggest that hydrogen sulfide enhanced the formation of ho from fenton like reactions of fes and h2o2 hydrogen sulfide can reduce feiii back into feii eq 12 and 13 which provided more available feii and accelerated the fenton like reactions su et al 2018 the enhanced formation of ho was also supported by the epr spectra fig 5b for example the intensity of dmpo ho at 3491 10 4 t in the system with hydrogen sulfide was 26 higher than that without hydrogen sulfide glycine glucose and humic acid were used as the surrogate or monomer for proteins polysaccharides and humic acid like components of the sludge epss identified in the liquid sludge fig s12b shows that the degradation of ba was barely changed in the presence of 10 mm glycine the degradation was slightly enhanced in the presence of 10 mm glucose surprisingly the presence of 10 mm humic acid significantly enhanced the degradation of ba the enhancement was likely due to the strong complexation effect of humic acid on iron species which converted insoluble iron into soluble form and provided more available iron species for the fenton like reactions to accelerate the ho production lindsey et al 2003 silva et al 2010 the enhanced formation of ho was also reinforced by the epr spectra fig 5b for example the intensity of dmpo ho at 3491 10 4 t in the system with humic acid was 23 higher than that without humic acid 3 5 phosphate removal from liquid sludge by oxidant dosing 3 5 1 efficiency of phosphate removal by selected oxidants besides hydrogen sulfide control and improvement of the sludge dewaterability oxidant dosing in the sulfide iron laden liquid sludge can also enhance phosphate removal from the liquid sludge the changes in the concentrations of dissolved phosphate in the liquid sludge before and after 4 h treatment by clo2 naclo2 and h2o2 at their optimal dosages were evaluated as shown in fig 6 the concentration of dissolved phosphate in the raw liquid sludge sample was 96 mg p l i e 48 mg p in mass the phosphate at such a high concentration in the liquid sludge can be derived from the phosphate release from phosphate accumulating organisms and the decomposition of ferric phosphate precipitates induced by chemical and biological iron reduction under anaerobic conditions yang et al 2006 after 4 h treatment by clo2 naclo2 and h2o2 the concentrations of dissolved phosphate decreased by 59 72 and 92 respectively fig 6 the dissolved phosphate was mainly transformed into the solid form and a good phosphate mass balance was achieved i e all recovery rates 95 the removal of dissolved phosphate was hypothesized to be induced by the oxidation of feii compounds in the sulfide iron laden sludge into feiii which precipitated and or adsorbed dissolved phosphate the different performances of clo2 naclo2 and h2o2 in the phosphate removal were likely associated with the different extents of feii oxidation in the real practice in wwtps the phosphate laden sludge filtrate concentrate generated from the sludge dewatering is often returned to the influent mainstream additional chemical dosing e g lime and fecl3 is usually required to enhance the phosphate removal from wastewater smolders et al 1996 the efficient phosphate removal from the sulfide iron laden liquid sludge induced by oxidant dosing is expected to significantly reduce the phosphate loadings of wastewater treatment and decrease the cost of phosphate removal these findings demonstrate that the addition of the selected oxidants in the sulfide iron laden liquid sludge can be a simple and cost effective strategy to remove hydrogen sulfide and phosphate in the liquid sludge and to improve the sludge dewaterability simultaneously this multi purposeful strategy reduces the high capital investment on installing a series of complex treatment units to separately handle each of the four problems it also lowers the chemical demand in each of the complex treatment units 3 5 2 precipitation and adsorption of phosphate by in situ formed feiii the removal of dissolved phosphate from the sulfide iron laden liquid sludge was attributed to the in situ formation of feiii from the oxidation of feii compounds by the dosed oxidants and or radicals as shown in fig 2 one peak at a binding energy of 712 8 ev was identified in the xps spectra of fe 2p orbital of the sludge samples after 4 h treatment with clo2 naclo2 and h2o2 which indicated the formation of ferric phosphate precipitates feiiipo4 pramatarova et al 2007 the precipitates were mainly in the crystal form of iron phosphate hydrate fig 7 which was generated from the reactions of phosphate with the feiii in situ formed from the oxidation of pre existing feii compounds eq 17 swanson 1963 in addition a portion of in situ formed feiii may undergo hydrolysis at ph around 6 0 to produce ferric hydroxides eq 11 which can also adsorb phosphate eq 18 17 f e 3 p o 4 3 h 2 o fep o 4 h 2 o s 18 fe oh 3 s po 4 3 fe oh 3 po 4 s 3 therefore the in situ formation of feiii via the oxidation of feii compounds by the dosed oxidants played a key role in the removal of phosphate in the sulfide iron laden liquid sludge compared to clo2 and naclo2 the superior performance of h2o2 in the phosphate removal was mainly due to the more significant oxidation of feii compounds by the radicals fig 5 it is worth noticing that the in situ formed feiii may also adsorb other pollutants such as arsenic chromium and ammonia which are often present in the liquid sludge agrafioti et al 2014 therefore the oxidant dosing in the feii laden sludge is expected to be a low cost solution to the simultaneous removal of various co present pollutants that show high affinity toward feiii hydr oxides in the sulfide iron laden liquid sludge 4 conclusions and environmental implications the multiple functions of h2o2 clo2 and naclo2 dosed in the sulfide iron laden liquid sludge are summarized in fig 8 the three selected oxidants directly oxidized hydrogen sulfide into s0 so4 2 and so3 2 and also converted feii compounds mainly fes present in the sludge into feiii the in situ formed feiii also oxidized hydrogen sulfide and precipitated adsorbed the soluble phosphate to the solid form fepo4 meanwhile the fenton like reactions of h2o2 with feii compounds generated ho and destructed emerging organic contaminants and the sludge epss e g soluble microbial byproduct like and humic acid like fractions which liberated water tightly bound with epss and thus improved the sludge dewaterability more dramatically compared to clo2 and naclo2 the formation of ho can be enhanced by hydrogen sulfide and the sludge epss through providing more available feii for the fenton like

16737,liquid sludge often contains odorous and toxic hydrogen sulfide and high levels of feii compounds e g iron sulfides due to the extensive use of iron salts for hydrogen sulfide control in sewers and for enhanced primary treatment and phosphate removal in wastewater treatment plants we proposed and verified that dosing appropriate chemical oxidants in the sulfide iron laden sludge can be a simple and cost effective strategy to remove hydrogen sulfide phosphate and emerging organic contaminants and to improve sludge dewaterability simultaneously among the seven oxidants investigated h2o2 clo2 and naclo2 were the more cost effective oxidants than others to control hydrogen sulfide release from the liquid sludge dosing these three oxidants also improved sludge dewaterability and removed dissolved phosphate from the liquid sludge with h2o2 performing the best hydrogen sulfide was removed via both direct oxidation by the dosed oxidants and indirect oxidation by the feiii that was in situ formed from oxidation of the feii compounds in the sludge the in situ formed feiii also precipitated adsorbed the soluble phosphate into the solid form fepo4 fenton like reactions occurred between h2o2 and the feii compounds in the sludge and hydroxyl radicals ho were generated ho oxidized hydrogen sulfide destructed refractory organic emerging contaminants and sludge extracellular polymeric compounds epss and improved the sludge dewaterability the formation of ho can be enhanced by hydrogen sulfide and the sludge epss present in the sludge through providing more available feii for the fenton like reactions this study demonstrates the importance of selecting and dosing suitable oxidants to the sulfide iron laden sludge with due consideration for the multiple benefits in engineering practices the same principles may be also used in formulating a dual oxidant iron strategy to treat sulfide iron laden sewage sludge and sediments for simultaneous abatement of various pollutants graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sludge treatment hydrogen sulfide eps destruction phosphate precipitation micropollutant removal 1 introduction sludge treatment is an indispensable process in wastewater treatment plants wwtps dignac et al 2000 in most wwtps the liquid sludge collected from the sedimentation tanks is thickened digested and then dewatered to concentrate the solids and reduce the volumes of sludge khanal et al 2007 mahmoud et al 2010 wei et al 2018 however a few major concerns have been widely recognized in the sludge treatment practice hydrogen sulfide h2s which is generated from biological sulfate reduction during the sludge retention at the bottom of sedimentation tanks anaerobic sludge digestion and temporary storage before dewatering yan et al 2018 zhang et al 2008 can be emitted from sludge and cause obnoxious odor nuisance and pose potential health risks to workers and nearby residents sun et al 2020 yin et al 2018 zhang et al 2008 the release of phosphate from the sludge phase into the liquid phase is another concern gutierrez et al 2010 oehmen et al 2007 because the phosphate rich filtrate concentrate is often returned to the mainstream after sludge dewatering which increases the phosphate loading of the mainstream sewage treatment processes smolders et al 1996 for example sludge digestion and retention under anaerobic conditions lead to the release of phosphate from phosphate accumulating organisms which uptake phosphate during biological phosphorus removal processes oehmen et al 2007 when ferric salts are used for the enhanced chemical phosphate removal ferric phosphate precipitates are formed and co settled with sludge the decomposition of ferric phosphate precipitates in the sludge under anaerobic conditions also causes liberation of phosphate due to chemical and biological iron reduction blöcher et al 2012 furthermore emerging organic contaminants e g carbamazepine and ibuprofen which are often accumulated in sludge can be also released during sludge storage and digestion carballa et al 2007 another issue of concern in sludge treatment is the difficulty in sludge dewatering due to the rigid structures of extracellular polymeric substances epss present in sludge flocs water bound to the sludge flocs is difficult to be removed during the conventional dewatering treatment e g filtration and centrifugation liu et al 2010 sheng and yu 2006 the poor sludge dewaterability is associated with the high energy consumption of dewatering and limits the further disposal e g incineration and landfill and recycling e g biofuel and construction materials of the dewatered sludge christensen et al 2015 neyens and baeyens 2003 sludge pretreatment to destruct epss and release tightly bound water improves sludge dewaterability to et al 2016 zeng et al 2019a zeng et al 2019b solutions to each of the four abovementioned concerns in sludge treatment have been reported in the literature the hydrogen sulfide generated in the liquid sludge can be eliminated by dosing chemical oxidants gutierrez et al 2008 zhang et al 2008 however the dosed oxidants may be competitively consumed by reducing compounds e g iron sulfides that are often present in the sludge and their cost effectiveness based on the properties of the sludge requires further investigation the widely practiced strategies to remove the phosphate in sewage and the filtrate return flow from the sludge treatment include chemical precipitation by ferric salts and adsorption by iron oxides barca et al 2012 gutierrez et al 2010 however the addition of iron salts and iron oxides increases the cost of the sludge treatment the refractory emerging organic contaminants can be destructed by advanced oxidation processes such as fenton process and uv hydrogen peroxide uv h2o2 process the sludge pretreatment by oxidation e g ultrasound conditioning electrolysis and fenton process and hydrothermal processes has been used to destruct sludge epss and improve the sludge dewaterability jensen et al 2014 liu et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 however the high energy and chemical consumption limit the applications of these pretreatment methods furthermore the combined implementation of them involves the installation of a series of complex treatment units and requires high capital investments and chemical consumption therefore it is desirable to formulate a simple and cost effective strategy to remove hydrogen sulfide phosphate and emerging organic contaminants in the liquid sludge and to improve its dewaterability simultaneously for the treatment of a liquid sludge containing both hydrogen sulfide and feii compounds referred to as sulfide iron laden liquid sludge dosing certain chemical oxidants may be a simple and cost effective strategy to achieve the four purposes simultaneously besides hydrogen sulfide the liquid sludge often contains feii compounds e g feii sulfides and feii hydr oxides at high concentrations 20 200 mg fe g tss because iron salts are widely used in sewers for sulfide control and in wwtps for the enhanced removal of suspended solids and phosphate from sewage ahmed et al 2020 likosova et al 2014 wilfert et al 2016 by dosing chemical oxidants to control hydrogen sulfide the feii compounds in the liquid sludge can be also oxidized and converted into ferric iron feiii gutierrez et al 2010 sun et al 2014 the in situ generated feiii is anticipated to precipitate phosphate in the liquid sludge yuan et al 2012 furthermore fenton fenton like reactions of feii salts and zero valent iron with certain oxidants e g h2o2 and persulfate are known to generate highly reactive species such as hydroxyl radicals ho and sulfate radicals so4 which would destruct emerging organic pollutants the sludge epss and improve the dewaterability of sludge zhou et al 2014 zhou et al 2015 such fenton like reactions can also take place between the dosed chemical oxidants and the feii compounds available in the iron laden liquid sludge however these hypothetically multiple functions of the chemical oxidants in treating the sulfide iron laden liquid sludge have never been investigated in the literature and demand further investigation to elucidate the complicated oxidant feii interactions that influence the four functions this study thus aimed to select cost effective oxidants and evaluate the multiple functions of the selected oxidants in treating the sulfide iron laden liquid sludge the cost effectiveness of seven oxidants for hydrogen sulfide removal in the real sludge samples was compared the removal of dissolved phosphate the degradation of emerging organic pollutants and the liquid sludge and the improvement of the sludge dewaterability with the addition of the selected oxidants were evaluated the chemical interactions of the dosed chemical oxidants with the feii compounds were also explored 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and

permanganate kmno4 nah2po4 and na2hpo4 were purchased from sigma aldrich unless otherwise specified all solutions were prepared by dissolving the powders or diluting the solutions using the deionized water 18 2 mω cm generated from a water purification system cascada pall corporation the solutions were stored at 4 c in the dark and brought back to room temperature of 22 1 c before use the liquid sludge samples were collected from a wastewater treatment plant stonecutters island sewage treatment works scistw in hong kong the domestic sewage at scistw was treated via chemically enhanced primary treatment using ferric chloride 15 mg l as fe and polyelectrolyte 0 5 mg l as coagulants zeng et al 2020 most of the dosed iron was accumulated in the liquid sludge in the sedimentation tanks the liquid sludge collected from the bottom of the sedimentation tanks was stored in the holding tanks for about 4 h before dewatering hydrogen sulfide was generated during the sludge storage under anaerobic conditions the liquid sludge samples collected at scistw were the typical sulfide iron laden sludge and high levels of 47 90 26 mg s l feii compounds 158 31 mg fe l and dissolved phosphate 96 6 mg p l were detected which were similar to a sludge sample taken from a sludge storage tank at liede wwtp guangzhou that treats freshwater wastewater table s1 2 2 experimental procedures 2 2 1 sludge pre incubation to restore the activity of srb the liquid sludge samples stored at 4 c were homogenized and pre incubated in a 5 l sealed bottle placed in a water bath at 32 c before each test during pre incubation aliquots of the sludge samples were taken out periodically and subjected to the analysis of dissolved hydrogen sulfide concentration the pre incubation was completed when the dissolved sulfide concentration of the sludge samples reached approximately 50 mg s l which was the average sulfide concentration in the liquid sludge recorded at scistw in the summer period 2 2 2 evaluation of hydrogen sulfide removal from the liquid sludge by oxidant dosing tests were conducted using a batch reactor system fig s1 to evaluate the removal of hydrogen sulfide from the liquid sludge by seven oxidants including naclo2 clo2 h2o2 kmno4 na2s2o8 naocl and na2co3 1 5h2o aliquots of the oxidant stock solutions were spiked into the 500 ml sealed glass reactors containing 250 ml pre incubated sludge samples to reach different predetermined oxidant dosages table s2 the reactors were then sealed and placed in a water bath of 32 c and the mixtures were then thoroughly blended using a magnetic stirrer for 4 h at the fixed time intervals aliquots of sludge samples were collected using a syringe and subjected to measurement of the concentrations of dissolved hydrogen sulfide at the same time intervals gas samples in the headspace of the reactor were purged with 2 l n2 gas into a gas bag and the gaseous h2s concentrations were analyzed using a h2s gas analyzer odalog type l2 a control test without the addition of any oxidant was also conducted tests were conducted in parallel in a similar manner to obtain samples for evaluation of the oxidation products of aqueous hydrogen sulfide by the selected oxidants i e h2o2 clo2 and clo2 after the 4 h of incubation 2 2 3 evaluation of changes in sludge dewaterability and phosphate removal from sludge with oxidant dosing tests were conducted in a similar manner as described in section 2 2 2 to evaluate the sludge dewaterability and phosphate removal in the liquid sludge samples with or without h2o2 clo2 and clo2 dosing at their optimal dosages for hydrogen sulfide control after 4 h of incubation sludge samples were collected and divided into five portions one portion was subjected to the analysis of dewaterability and one portion was subjected to the analysis of particle size distribution one portion of the sludge samples was filtered through 0 45 µm membrane filters and subjected to the characterization of the epss one portion was used for the measurement of total and dissolved phosphate concentrations another portion was freeze dried after being washed by deoxygenated deionized water the dried samples were characterized to examine the surface properties of the sludge 2 2 4 evaluation of reactive species generation and emerging organic contaminant degradation induced by interactions of selected oxidants with feii supplementary tests were performed in a similar manner as described in section 2 2 2 to probe the generation of radicals from the interactions of selected oxidants with feii compounds in the sulfide iron laden liquid sludge benzoic acid ba was added as a radical probe compound which was highly reactive towards ho k 5 9 109 m 1s 1 buxton et al 1988 zhao et al 2021a samples were withdrawn at predetermined time intervals filtered and analyzed for the remaining concentrations of ba the concentrations of iron species e g feiii and feii and sulfur species e g sulfide sulfate thiosulfate before and after reacting with oxidants were measured to identify the formation of ho from the reactions of iron sulfide fes with h2o2 100 mm 5 5 dimethyl pyrroline n oxide dmpo solution was spiked into the reactor and the solution samples were collected and subjected to the analysis of electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectra the degradation of emerging organic contaminants i e carbamazepine caffeine and ibuprofen induced by the interactions of selected oxidants with feii was also evaluated 2 3 analytical methods and statistical analysis the analytical methods are described in detail in text s1 all experiments were conducted in duplicate the data were expressed as mean standard deviation of the two parallel experiments statistical significance p 0

to treat 1 m3 of liquid sludge m usd m3 sludge were estimated based on the optimal oxidant dosages to achieve the desired control targets h2s gas concentration 5 ppm and dissolved sulfide concentration 0 5 mg l eq 1 1 m d p η 10 6 where d is the optimal oxidant dosage determined mg l p is the unit price of 1 ton of the commercial oxidant product usd ton which was based on alibaba international prices in 2020 alibaba com η is the concentration of the oxidant in the corresponding commercial product 3 results and discussion 3 1 control of hydrogen sulfide from liquid sludge by oxidant dosing 3 1 1 efficiencies and cost effectiveness of seven oxidants the efficiencies and cost effectiveness of the seven oxidants for the control of hydrogen sulfide release from the sulfide iron laden liquid sludge were evaluated to select the cost effective oxidants in real engineering practice seven oxidants including naclo2 clo2 h2o2 kmno4 na2s2o8 na2co3 1 5h2o2 and naocl at different dosages were dosed in the batch reactors fig s1 with the real liquid sludge samples the changes in the concentrations of dissolved hydrogen sulfide in the liquid sludge and gaseous h2s in the headspace of the reactors are shown in fig s3 and fig s4 respectively the seven oxidants effectively removed the dissolved hydrogen sulfide in the liquid sludge and suppressed the release of h2s gas for example the concentration of dissolved hydrogen sulfide in the sludge was below 0 5 mg s l and h2s gas concentration was lower than 5 ppm within 4 h when 800 mg l naclo2 was dosed fig s3a and fig s4a the corresponding optimal oxidant dosages which achieved the desired hydrogen sulfide control performance i e h2s gas 5 ppm and h2s liquid 0 5 mg s l within 4 h were operationally defined and are summarized in table 1 it is worth noticing that the optimal dosages of clo2 and h2o2 were 400 and 500 mg l respectively which were much lower than those of the other five oxidants tested the ph values of the sludge samples did not change significantly after the addition of h2o2 clo2 and naclo2 fig s5 while orp increased from about 200 mv to 50 mv above fig s6 the significant orp elevation was expected to prevent the formation of hydrogen sulfide during the prolonged storage because the activity of srb can be inhibited at an orp of 50 mv or above peng et al 2020 zhang et al 2008 in real practice chemical oxidants in the solutions can be automatically dosed in the liquid sludge through a pump and the extensive input of labor force and the installation of complicated facilities can be minimized the costs of oxidant dosing mainly involved the chemical consumption the chemical costs of the seven oxidants to treat 1 m3 of the liquid sludge at their optimal dosages were estimated according to the unit prices of industrial grade products quoted from alibaba com table s3 as shown in table 1 the chemical costs of dosing h2o2 clo2 and naclo2 were 0 34 1 17 and 1 38 usd m3 sludge respectively while that of na2s2o8 was up to 3 93 usd m3 sludge aeration which is often used for the control of hydrogen sulfide in wastewater and sludge was also performed as a comparison text s2 and text s3 as shown in fig s7 the h2s gas concentration in the gas outlet of the reactor gradually decreased to less than 5 ppm after 90 min aeration at an air flow rate of 0 9 l air min l sludge the concentration of dissolved hydrogen sulfide also decreased to 0 2 mg s l after 4 h aeration fig s8 however the strong stripping effect induced by aeration caused the significant release of h2s gas up to 300 ppm within 20 min which would require additional treatment of h2s gas in addition the energy cost of aeration was estimated to be 5 68 usd m3 sludge which was 3 12 15 7 times higher than the chemical costs of dosing h2o2 clo2 and naclo2 the results demonstrate that dosing selected oxidants i e h2o2 clo2 and naclo2 can be a promising and cost effective approach for the control of hydrogen sulfide in the liquid sludge 3 1 2 mechanisms of oxidation of hydrogen sulfide by oxidants and in situ formed feiii hydrogen sulfide in the sulfide iron laden liquid sludge can be oxidized by the dosed oxidants and by the feiii in situ formed from the oxidation of feii compounds present in the liquid sludge the sulfur containing products of hydrogen sulfide oxidation by clo2 naclo2 and h2o2 at various oxidant to sulfide molar ratios were evaluated as shown in fig s9 the major sulfur containing products of hydrogen sulfide oxidation by clo2 were sulfite and sulfate i e 82 1 98 9 in total while elemental sulfur sulfite and sulfate became the major sulfur products i e 91 3 100 in total by naclo2 and h2o2 the reactions of hydrogen sulfide with the three oxidants can be described using eqs 2 9 cadena and peters 1988 hoffmann 1977 the stoichiometry suggests that the dosages of the three oxidants were higher than the theoretical oxidant demands i e around 50 mg s l to oxidize hydrogen sulfide in the sludge the electron accepting capacities of 400 mg l clo2 800 mg l naclo2 and 500 mg l h2o2 were comparable i e 29 41 35 38 mm electron which were higher than electron donating capacity of 50 mg s l hydrogen sulfide in the liquid sludge i e 3 13 12 51 mm electron table s4 the results indicated that a portion of the dosed oxidants should be competitively consumed by feii compounds in the sulfide iron laden liquid sludge 2 6 cl o 2 5 h 2 s 3 h 2 o 5 s o 3 2 6 c l 16 h 3 8 cl o 2 5 h 2 s 4 h 2 o 5 s o 4 2 8 c l 18 h 4 3 cl o 2 2 h 2 s 2 s o 3 2 3 c l 4 h 5 cl o 2 2 h 2 s 2 s 0 c l 2

and the in situ formation of feiii can also contribute to the removal of hydrogen sulfide fig 1 shows that the concentration of feii present in the raw sludge was up to 158 mg fe l which was mainly in form of fes i e 70 8 the xps spectra also confirm the presence of abundant fes at 713 6 ev fig 2 siriwardane and cook 1985 after the treatment with clo2 naclo2 and h2o2 feii concentrations decreased to 129 93 and 65 mg fe l sludge respectively and the feiii concentration increased from 42 mg fe l to 71 107 and 135 mg fe l sludge accordingly fig 1 mainly due to the oxidation of fes eq 10 the trends observed were consistent with the peak shifts in the xps spectra fig 2 the in situ formed feiii and its hydrolysis product fe oh 3 eq 11 was expected to further remove hydrogen sulfide via oxidation and precipitation eqs 12 14 it should be noted that the formed fe oh 3 in the solid formed would retain in the dewatered sludge after dewatering and serve as a prolonged reagent for hydrogen sulfide control during the sludge storage and transportation sun et al 2014 sun et al 2019 10 fes cl o 2 nacl o 2 h 2 o 2 f e 3 s 0 s o 3 2 s o 4 2 11 f e 3 3 h 2 o fe oh 3 3 h 12 2 f e 3 h 2 s 2 f e

the sulfide iron laden liquid sludge on the sludge dewaterability was also investigated clo2 naclo2 and h2o2 which were more cost effective for the hydrogen sulfide control than the other four oxidants were dosed in the liquid sludge at their optimal dosages the cst values of the sludge before and after the treatment by 400 mg l clo2 800 mg l naclo2 and 500 mg l h2o2 for 4 h are shown in table 2 the cst of the raw sludge sample was 260 11 s which was within the range 50 400 s of the sludge samples from municipal wastewater reported in the literature chen et al 1996 scholz 2005 the cst values of the sludge decreased to 208 3 176 5 and 108 6 s respectively after 4 h treatment with clo2 naclo2 and h2o2 which were 20 32 and 59 lower than the control without oxidant dosing p 0 05 the enhancement in the sludge dewaterability induced by clo2 naclo2 and h2o2 was likely attributed to the destruction of epss by oxidants and radicals formed from the fenton like reactions of the dosed oxidants with the feii compounds present in the sulfide iron laden liquid sludge sheng et al 2010 xu et al 2013 the enhancement in the sludge dewaterability induced by the oxidant dosing in the sulfide iron laden liquid sludge can facilitate the sludge treatment and disposal practice the energy consumption of sludge dewatering via filtration and centrifuge was expected to reduce due to the improvement in the sludge dewaterability qi et al 2011 yin et al 2020a furthermore the better sludge dewaterability will also increase the solid content of the dewatered sludge based on the empirical model proposed by a previous study wu et al 2020 the decrease in cst values i e 20 32 and 59 induced by the addition of clo2 naclo2 and h2o2 would increase the solid content of sludge by 18 29 and 49 respectively the elevated solid content of the dewatered sludge will bring significant benefits to the disposal and recycling of the dewatered sludge such as saving transportation costs and landfill volume reducing energy consumption required by sludge incineration and better quality for recycling e g construction materials and biochar wang et al 2017 zhao et al 2021b the destruction of the sludge epss that was likely induced by oxidants and reactive species formed from fenton like reactions between feii compounds and oxidants was anticipated to be one important contributor to the enhancement in the sludge dewaterability the rigid structures of epss which are mainly composed of polysaccharides and proteins tightly bound water with the sludge flocs and lead to the poor dewaterability of the liquid sludge sheng et al 2010 the eem spectra fig 3 a show that the epss extracted from the raw sludge samples mainly contained soluble microbial by product like moieties λem 320 nm λex 280 nm aromatic proteins λem 310 nm λex 220 nm and fluvic acid like moieties λem 500 nm λex 240 nm after 4 h treatment by clo2 and naclo2 the intensity of soluble microbial by product like moieties fulvic acid like moieties and aromatic proteins all decreased fig 3b and fig 3c which was due to the destruction of sludge epss by clo2 and naclo2 lin et al 2012 song et al 2020 interestingly nearly no obvious peak was detected after the treatment by h2o2 fig 3d the more significant destruction of epss by h2o2 than clo2 and naclo2 was likely due to the involvement of radicals considering that the oxidative capability of h2o2 was lower than those of clo2 and naclo2 table s4 the destruction of the sludge epss liberated the tightly bound water and caused the fragmentation of the sludge flocs which thus enhanced the sludge dewaterability this was well supported by the pronounced shifts in the particle size distribution of the sludge flocs fig s10 the mean particle size d50 of the sludge particles decreased from 1467 µm to 23 48 and 107 µm after the treatment by h2o2 naclo2 and clo2 respectively 3 3 degradation of emerging organic contaminants in liquid sludge by oxidant dosing besides hydrogen sulfide emerging organic contaminants which are often present in sewage and partially accumulate in the sludge carballa et al 2007 can also be degraded by oxidant dosing in the sulfide iron laden liquid sludge as shown in fig 4 concentrations of the three selected emerging organic contaminants kept decreasing over time in the simulated liquid sludge system containing hydrogen sulfide fes and h2o2 carbamazepine ibuprofen and caffeine were degraded by 58 21 and 16 respectively after 5 min the degradation percentages were expected to increase with increasing reaction time the tested emerging organic contaminants were barely removed by fes alone h2o2 alone or s2 alone their degradation was hypothesized to be attributed to the reactive species e g ho generated in the systems 3 4 mechanisms of reactive species formation from fenton like reactions of oxidants and feii compounds 3 4 1 identification of reactive species the enhanced destruction of sludge epss and emerging organic contaminants can be attributable to the in situ formation of reactive species from fenton like reactions between feii compounds mainly fes and the oxidants dosed in the sulfide iron laden liquid sludge the reactive species in situ formed were identified ho that are in situ generated from the fenton like reactions of feii compounds mainly fes with h2o2 were hypothesized to be an important reactive species benzoic acid ba which is highly reactive towards ho k 5 9 109 m 1 s 1 but hardly reacts with h2o2 or fes alone was selected as a probe to demonstrate the generation of ho in the system containing hydrogen sulfide fes and h2o2 buxton et al 1988 as shown in fig 5 a ba was rapidly degraded only in the h2s fes h2o2 system while its degradation was completely inhibited in the presence of tert butanol tba which is a scavenger to ho k 6 0 108 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 the epr spectra also show the distinct characteristic peaks of dmpo ho relative intensities of 1 2 2 1 spin adducts in the reaction systems fig 5b the results confirmed that ho was generated from the fenton like reactions of h2o2 with fes present in the sulfide iron laden liquid sludge at a slightly acidic ph 5 3 6 3 eq 15 15 f e ii h 2 o 2 f e iii ho o h besides ho ferryl ion feiv which is highly reactive towards many organic compounds can also be generated from the reaction between ferrous ion fe2 and h2o2 eq 16 and contribute to the degradation of emerging organic contaminants in the simulated liquid sludge system containing hydrogen sulfide fes and h2o2 to verify whether feiv was involved in the system quenching experiments were conducted to further confirm the involvement of feiv using tba and pmso as the quenchers tba reacts rapidly with ho k 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 but slowly with feiv k 6 0 101 m 1 s 1 table s5 buxton et al 1988 neta et al 1977 and it is used as the quencher to ho only pmso reacts rapidly with both ho k 3 61 108 m 1 s 1 but slowly with feiv k 1 23 105 m 1 s 1 table s5 buxton et al 1988 neta et al 1977 and it is used as the quencher to both ho and feiv as shown in fig s11 the presence of high concentrations of tba and pmso both inhibited the degradation of benzoic acid significantly however the inhibitory effect was comparable by using the two quenchers the results suggest that the formation of feiv was minor in the liquid sludge system containing hydrogen sulfide fes and h2o2 due to the acidic conditions ph 5 5 and ho was the major contributor to the enhanced destruction of sludge epss and emerging organic contaminants 16 f e 2 h 2 o 2 f e iv o 2 h 2 o ho was more reactive than the oxidants e g h2o2 clo2 and chlorine toward the polysaccharides and proteins of the sludge epss neyens et al 2004 yu et al 2019 which largely improved the sludge dewaterability ho can also degrade refractory organic pollutants by radical addition and h abstraction reactions 3 4 2 enhanced ho formation by hydrogen sulfide and sludge epss the matrix components in the liquid sludge including dissolved sulfide and sludge epss are anticipated to affect the radical generation in the fenton like reactions fig s12a shows that the presence of hydrogen sulfide enhanced the degradation of ba significantly the results suggest that hydrogen sulfide enhanced the formation of ho from fenton like reactions of fes and h2o2 hydrogen sulfide can reduce feiii back into feii eq 12 and 13 which provided more available feii and accelerated the fenton like reactions su et al 2018 the enhanced formation of ho was also supported by the epr spectra fig 5b for example the intensity of dmpo ho at 3491 10 4 t in the system with hydrogen sulfide was 26 higher than that without hydrogen sulfide glycine glucose and humic acid were used as the surrogate or monomer for proteins polysaccharides and humic acid like components of the sludge epss identified in the liquid sludge fig s12b shows that the degradation of ba was barely changed in the presence of 10 mm glycine the degradation was slightly enhanced in the presence of 10 mm glucose surprisingly the presence of 10 mm humic acid significantly enhanced the degradation of ba the enhancement was likely due to the strong complexation effect of humic acid on iron species which converted insoluble iron into soluble form and provided more available iron species for the fenton like reactions to accelerate the ho production lindsey et al 2003 silva et al 2010 the enhanced formation of ho was also reinforced by the epr spectra fig 5b for example the intensity of dmpo ho at 3491 10 4 t in the system with humic acid was 23 higher than that without humic acid 3 5 phosphate removal from liquid sludge by oxidant dosing 3 5 1 efficiency of phosphate removal by selected oxidants besides hydrogen sulfide control and improvement of the sludge dewaterability oxidant dosing in the sulfide iron laden liquid sludge can also enhance phosphate removal from the liquid sludge the changes in the concentrations of dissolved phosphate in the liquid sludge before and after 4 h treatment by clo2 naclo2 and h2o2 at their optimal dosages were evaluated as shown in fig 6 the concentration of dissolved phosphate in the raw liquid sludge sample was 96 mg p l i e 48 mg p in mass the phosphate at such a high concentration in the liquid sludge can be derived from the phosphate release from phosphate accumulating organisms and the decomposition of ferric phosphate precipitates induced by chemical and biological iron reduction under anaerobic conditions yang et al 2006 after 4 h treatment by clo2 naclo2 and h2o2 the concentrations of dissolved phosphate decreased by 59 72 and 92 respectively fig 6 the dissolved phosphate was mainly transformed into the solid form and a good phosphate mass balance was achieved i e all recovery rates 95 the removal of dissolved phosphate was hypothesized to be induced by the oxidation of feii compounds in the sulfide iron laden sludge into feiii which precipitated and or adsorbed dissolved phosphate the different performances of clo2 naclo2 and h2o2 in the phosphate removal were likely associated with the different extents of feii oxidation in the real practice in wwtps the phosphate laden sludge filtrate concentrate generated from the sludge dewatering is often returned to the influent mainstream additional chemical dosing e g lime and fecl3 is usually required to enhance the phosphate removal from wastewater smolders et al 1996 the efficient phosphate removal from the sulfide iron laden liquid sludge induced by oxidant dosing is expected to significantly reduce the phosphate loadings of wastewater treatment and decrease the cost of phosphate removal these findings demonstrate that the addition of the selected oxidants in the sulfide iron laden liquid sludge can be a simple and cost effective strategy to remove hydrogen sulfide and phosphate in the liquid sludge and to improve the sludge dewaterability simultaneously this multi purposeful strategy reduces the high capital investment on installing a series of complex treatment units to separately handle each of the four problems it also lowers the chemical demand in each of the complex treatment units 3 5 2 precipitation and adsorption of phosphate by in situ formed feiii the removal of dissolved phosphate from the sulfide iron laden liquid sludge was attributed to the in situ formation of feiii from the oxidation of feii compounds by the dosed oxidants and or radicals as shown in fig 2 one peak at a binding energy of 712 8 ev was identified in the xps spectra of fe 2p orbital of the sludge samples after 4 h treatment with clo2 naclo2 and h2o2 which indicated the formation of ferric phosphate precipitates feiiipo4 pramatarova et al 2007 the precipitates were mainly in the crystal form of iron phosphate hydrate fig 7 which was generated from the reactions of phosphate with the feiii in situ formed from the oxidation of pre existing feii compounds eq 17 swanson 1963 in addition a portion of in situ formed feiii may undergo hydrolysis at ph around 6 0 to produce ferric hydroxides eq 11 which can also adsorb phosphate eq 18 17 f e 3 p o 4 3 h 2 o fep o 4 h 2 o s 18 fe oh 3 s po 4 3 fe oh 3 po 4 s 3 therefore the in situ formation of feiii via the oxidation of feii compounds by the dosed oxidants played a key role in the removal of phosphate in the sulfide iron laden liquid sludge compared to clo2 and naclo2 the superior performance of h2o2 in the phosphate removal was mainly due to the more significant oxidation of feii compounds by the radicals fig 5 it is worth noticing that the in situ formed feiii may also adsorb other pollutants such as arsenic chromium and ammonia which are often present in the liquid sludge agrafioti et al 2014 therefore the oxidant dosing in the feii laden sludge is expected to be a low cost solution to the simultaneous removal of various co present pollutants that show high affinity toward feiii hydr oxides in the sulfide iron laden liquid sludge 4 conclusions and environmental implications the multiple functions of h2o2 clo2 and naclo2 dosed in the sulfide iron laden liquid sludge are summarized in fig 8 the three selected oxidants directly oxidized hydrogen sulfide into s0 so4 2 and so3 2 and also converted feii compounds mainly fes present in the sludge into feiii the in situ formed feiii also oxidized hydrogen sulfide and precipitated adsorbed the soluble phosphate to the solid form fepo4 meanwhile the fenton like reactions of h2o2 with feii compounds generated ho and destructed emerging organic contaminants and the sludge epss e g soluble microbial byproduct like and humic acid like fractions which liberated water tightly bound with epss and thus improved the sludge dewaterability more dramatically compared to clo2 and naclo2 the formation of ho can be enhanced by hydrogen sulfide and the sludge epss through providing more available feii for the fenton like reactions the findings suggest that dosing selected chemical oxidants in the sulfide iron laden sludge can bring multiple benefits due to the interactions of oxidants with feii compounds the liquid sludge often contains feii compounds e g feii sulfides and feii hydr oxides at high concentrations 20 200 mg fe g tss because iron salts are widely used in sewers for sulfide control and in wwtps to remove suspended solids and phosphate from sewage ge et al 2013 shrestha et al 2019 yin et al 2020b the in situ formed feiii can precipitate and or adsorb phosphate ammonia heavy metals etc the radicals generated from the fenton like reactions are expected to contribute to the destruction of the sludge epss and refractory organic pollutants that have been accumulated in the sludge the same principles may be also used in designing a dual oxidant iron strategy to treat the sulfide iron laden sewage sludge sediments and oil reservoirs to control various organic and inorganic pollutants e g hydrogen sulfide refractory organic pollutants phosphate ammonia and heavy metals simultaneously declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

16738,in this study a full cycle of agricultural reuse of agro food wastewater synthetic fresh cut wastewater sfcww at pilot plant scale has been investigated treated sfcww by ozonation and two solar processes h2o2 solar fe3 eddha h2o2 solar was used to irrigate two raw eaten crops lettuce and radish grown in peat two foodborne pathogens e coli o157 h7 and salmonella enteritidis and five organic microcontaminants omcs atrazine azoxystrobin buprofezin procymidone and terbutryn were monitored along the whole process the three studied processes showed a high treatment capability reaching microbial loads 7 cfu 100 ml and 21 90 of omc reduction robustness based on 7 or 10 analysed batches for each treatment process and high suitability for subsequent treated sfcww safe reuse non phytotoxic towards lactuca sativa and no bacterial regrowth during its storage for a week the analysis of the harvested crop samples irrigated with treated sfcww in all the studied processes showed an absence of microbial contamination limit of detection lod i e 1 cfu 99 g of lettuce and 1 cfu 8 g of radish a significant reduction of omc uptake in the range 40 60 and 90 for solar treated and ozonated sfcww respectively and bioaccumulation in both crops in comparison with the results obtained with untreated sfcww moreover the chlorophyll content in the harvested lettuces irrigated with sfcww treated by fe3 eddha h2o2 solar was twice than that irrigated with sfcww treated by h2o2 solar and ozone indicating the additional advantage of using fe3 eddha as an iron source to reduce the risk of iron chlorosis in crops finally the chemical dietary risk assessment for the combined exposure of the 5 omcs and quantitative microbiological risk assessment qmra of the harvested crops showed the capability of the studied processes to reduce the risk associated with untreated sfcww reuse by more than 50 and more than 4 orders of magnitude respectively graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords water storage in vivo reuse water disinfection risk assessment organic microcontaminants 1 introduction the increasing water scarcity turned reclaimed wastewater as a valued alternative water source for vegetable irrigation in arid and semiarid regions ungureanu et al 2020 agriculture is by far the largest water consumer and consequently its related industries agro food are also sectors with higher water consumption among these industries the growing fresh cut produce industry stands out due to the huge volumes of water needed to produce the marketed products mainly associated to the cultivation of short term salad crops ca 54 m3 per ton and their washing in the industrial processing line up to 11 m3 per ton perrin et al 2014 ölmez 2013 hence in view of the synergies between these sectors a transition to a circular economy by the reuse of wastewater from agro food industries in agriculture represents a sustainable strategy to reduce the water footprint of these industries and to guarantee future water and food availability in water scarce regions inyinbor et al 2019 nonetheless fresh cut wastewater fcww is associated to microbiological and chemical contamination derived from raw products making necessary its treatment for recycling in the own industrial processing or prior to its discharge reuse in line with this and in parallel to the recent fresh cut industry growth a remarkable increase in the number of worldwide outbreaks linked to leafy vegetable consumption has been reported mainly caused by the pathogenic bacteria e coli o157 h7 and salmonella spp kaczmarek et al 2019 callejón et al 2015 therefore to decrease the microbiological risk associated with the consumption of fresh cut products chlorinating the processing water is the most commonly applied strategy nevertheless as it is well known chlorination generates harmful disinfection by products dbps such as chlorates which can be directly transferred to fresh cut products during the industrial processing estimated ca 4 mg kg or indirectly by plant uptake if the chlorinated wastewater is reused estimated ca 0 5 mg kg representing a potential health risk for consumers gil et al 2016 garrido et al 2020 in addition fcww could be chemically contaminated mainly by pesticides at very low concentrations organic microcontaminants omcs these omcs can get accumulated during the industrial processing increasing the environmental and health risk associated to the subsequent discharge or reuse of wastewater as the chlorination stage has proven not to be efficient in their removal kong et al 2020 these current concerns have led to a marked increase in the search and evaluation of alternative water treatments bilek and turantas 2013 although most of these treatments are mainly focused on the inactivation of foodborne pathogens and do not take omcs into account meireles et al 2016 artés hernández et al 2017 ozonation is one of the most promising treatments for chlorination replacement due to several reasons such as its approved use for food contact its in situ generation efficiency against a wider range of microorganisms than chlorination and its decomposition without leaving residues tomas and tiwari 2013 nevertheless dbp generation and the high operating cost of ozonation mainly related to electric consumption have forced the interest on searching for cheaper and more sustainable alternatives in this regard the capability of uv a irradiation 320 400 nm from both natural sunlight or lamps in combination with chemical agents to promote the formation of highly reactive species and the high water disinfection efficiency showed by photochemical and photocatalytic processes has led to consider them as feasible alternatives cossu et al 2018 among the different solar driven technologies the solar photo fenton process is an outstanding choice as a homogeneous advanced oxidation process aop based on the generation of the powerful hydroxyl radicals ho through the decomposition of h2o2 by using iron salts as a catalyst this solar driven aop has demonstrated a high disinfection and decontamination capability in multiple water matrices including agro food wastewater carra et al 2015 nevertheless the optimal process efficiency is attained at acidic operating conditions 2 8 which increases the treatment cost representing one of its main drawbacks as a result in recent years searching and evaluating alternative iron sources or complexing agents that could maintain iron in solution at near neutral ph has grown recent studies have demonstrated the capability of the commercial iron fertilizer fe3 eddha ethylenediamine n n bis 2 hydroxyphenylacetic acid for the treatment of sfcww nahim granados et al 2020a this iron chelate is commonly used in mediterranean agriculture to increase iron bioavailability for plants and avoid plant disease known as iron chlorosis therefore its implementation in a circular system for water reclamation and reuse represents a plausible and attractive option to simultaneously tackling two important problems water stress and iron chlorosis another solar driven process able to be applied at neutral ph which has shown high wastewater disinfection efficiencies is the solar photo inactivation process assisted with low concentrations of h2o2 known as h2o2 solar process this simple photochemical process is able to improve the inactivation kinetic of several microorganisms based on synergistic effects between solar photo oxidative damages and internal oxidative mechanisms giannakis et al 2016 finally it is important to highlight that although regulations of water reuse have been recently established with the aim of decreasing the human and environmental risks related to this practice regulation eu 2020 741 several knowledge gaps are still under investigation and more experimental studies are needed in order to evaluate them including the microbial regrowth during treated water storage potential translocation bioaccumulation of omcs to crops and soils and human health risks associated with the consumer exposition to microbial and chemical pollutants through the food crop chain ikehata 2013 thus this study aims to 1 assess the feasibility of two solar driven technologies h2o2 solar and solar photo fenton with fe3 eddha and a conventional commercial treatment

tests were also performed with mineral water negative control and untreated sfcww positive control 2 2 1 microbiological analysis of harvested crops e coli o157 h7 and s enteritidis were analysed according to the standard plate counting method using the previously described selective agar media and cultivation conditions the procedure of vegetables lettuce leaves and radish fruit and peat

concentration of omcs and bacteria detected in all treated sfcww batches at the end of the treatment time 300 and 240 min for solar and ozonation processess respectively bacterial reductions of 5 log were obtained in all cases reaching at the treatment end point the microbiological quality required for irrigation of raw eaten crops in direct contact with reclaimed water e coli 10 cfu 100 ml regulation eu 2020 741 results in agreement with aguas et al where the lod for e coli spp salmonella spp enterococcus spp and total coliforms present in uww effluents were reached after 300 min of solar treatment by h2o2 solar 20 mg l and solar photo fenton 10 20 mg l of fe2 h2o2 aguas et al 2019 total load of omcs was reduced but they were still present in the treated sfcww by all the technologies and conditions evaluated as was previously reported by several different water treatment technologies activated carbon o3 uv and solar technologies rizzo et al 2020 removal was significantly higher for ozonation 90 than for all solar processes 50 without significant differences between the evaluated solar processes the results are in agreement with the higher oxidative capability of the ozonation process and the mild oxidative conditions implemented for the two studied solar processes only 2 5 mg l of iron and 20 mg l of h2o2 as expected these results are in accordance with previous studies reporting sfcww disinfection and decontamination under similar operational conditions reaching a slightly better treatment performance from all solar tested processes fe3 eddha h2o2 solar at 2 5 20 mg l of reagent concentration nahim granados et al 2020a 2020b it also supports the robustness of solar processes to treat sfcww in real and fluctuating weather conditions table s1 3 1 2 storage monitoring water storage is a key matter in wastewater reclamation if the applied process did not meet correctly the microbicidal dose and even more considering that its organic matter content is able to feed microorganisms empowering the risks of reactivation and growth conversely the presence of a residual oxidant concentration can inhibit these potential risks li et al 2013 therefore an exhaustive monitoring of the treated sfcww was carried out after 3 and 7 days of storage in darkness and at 4 c omc concentration did not show significant differences in any case in comparison with the final concentration detected in each treated sfcww batch data not shown regarding microbial contamination no regrowth was observed for any bacteria and tested condition fig 1 remaining the bacterial concentrations below lod for wastewater reclamation 10 cfu 100 ml regulation eu 2020 741 the presence of a residual oxidant concentration can contribute to avoiding bacterial regrowth while the remaining iron concentration in solution is one of the treatment strengths of the fe3 eddha h2o2 solar process as it constitutes an additional iron source useful for vegetable metabolism the concentration profile of both reagents during solar treated sfcww storage is presented in fig s1 non significant differences in dissolved iron concentration were observed 1 49 0 03 and 0 34 0 02 mg l for 2 5 and 5 mg l of fe3 eddha respectively conversely a significant and similar decrease was observed for h2o2 in the three studied conditions h2o2 solar and fe3 eddha h2o2 solar process with both reagent combinations 26 2 and 37 2 for 3 and 7 storage days respectively data suggest that in our case the h2o2 decomposition process during treated water storage is not related to the applied treatment and therefore neither to the water matrix used 3 1 3 phytotoxicity assessment phytotoxicity results are shown in table 2 in general non significant phytotoxicity effects were observed in any treated sfcww by ozone and solar processes as well as in untreated sfcww therefore the selected omcs the residual h2o2 concentration and any chemical degradation products from omcs and or the iron chelate can be discarded as potential harmful substances for crops cultivation similar results regarding absence of toxic effect of omcs at 100 µg l towards root elongation have been reported in literature margenat et al 2017 supporting the findings obtained in our study opposite to our results in previous works where toxicity of treated sfcww by ozonation and fe3 eddha h2o2 solar process was assessed but using vibrio fischeri as model of environmental toxicity test a slight toxic effect was detected nahim granados et al 2020a 2020b therefore the importance of the test and the organism selected depending on the intended end use of the treated wastewater is crucial to give a realistic potential toxicity risk although the rgi value obtained for ozonation and fe3 eddha h2o2 solar process at both conditions samples showed non significant phytotoxicity 1 10 to 1 20 the higher rgi values with respect to untreated sfcww 1 07 can be explained based on the presence of more quantity of assimilable organic matter derived from low molecular weight fractions from ozonation process or the fertilization derived from the iron chelate addition finally it is important to mention that stimulation and inhibition results are observed for treated sfcww by h2o2 solar and chlorination 100 mg l processes respectively the stimulation effect rgi value 1 2 observed after the h2o2 solar process could be due to the presence of a high residual h2o2 concentration 13 mg l that could act in different ways 1 providing protection from potential microbial infections 2 weakening the endosperm cap accelerating the seed germination process wojtyla et al 2016 and 3 generating additional oxygenation to the seedling after its decomposition liu et al 2012 the inhibition effect showed by the chlorinated sfcww can be due to both the presence of residual chlorine and or toxic chlorinated dbps lonigro et al 2017 this highlights the suitability of the proposed treatments as alternatives to chlorination for further use in crop irrigation 3 2 evaluation of harvested crops 3 2 1 organic microcontaminants analysis fig 2 shows omc concentrations in both raw eaten crops irrigated with treated and untreated sfcww results demonstrated that all the omcs were uptaken by both types of vegetables the omc uptake pathway is mainly attributed to root uptake diffusion through the vascular system phloem and or xylem and further translocation to aboveground tissues by the transpiration derived mass flow christou et al 2019 taking into account the pk a values of the target omcs from 0 9 to 6 7 table s3 all of them are neutral species in both peat solution ph 7 and plant system ph from 5 5 in vacuoles and sap xylem to 7 in the cytoplasm due to its neutral character they are easily absorbed and translocated in both environments thus avoiding the electrical repulsion with cell membranes usually observed for ionic species christou et al 2019 martínez piernas et al 2018b another important descriptor is their lipophilicity log k ow polar omcs i e log k ow value between 1 and 5 favours the absorption and transport of chemical compounds aguas et al 2019 based on the log k ow values of the target compounds from 2 5 to 4 93 table s3 and in agreement with the obtained results the uptake and translocation of the five selected omcs can also be explained nevertheless differences in the uptake and translocation rates of different omcs are usually observed due to their passage through the different plant structures is also dependent on the especific chemical structure and chemical polarity configuration of each omc molecular weight electronegative groups and polar surface area the presence of high electronegative groups such as chlorine in omc structures low molecular weight 300 and a small polar surface area have been reported as chemical characteristics that favour the uptake and translocation of omcs characteristics which are in agreement with the higher concentrations observed in this study for atz and pcm in both vegetables table s3 and fig 2 brooke et al 1986 eggen et al 2013 a higher omc load in lettuce than in radish was observed lettuces are leafy vegetables which present a high transpiration stream to leaves transpiration organs in comparison with the stream towards roots or fruits of other vegetables which favours the translocation and accumulation of omcs aguas et al 2019 martínez piernas et al 2018b besides and although the uptake capacity of roots is lower than in leafy vegetables radish is in direct contact with the soil containing omcs enabling their penetration in root crops and consequently a high omc accumulation was also observed for this raw eaten crop christou et al 2019 regarding the efficiency of the studied oxidation processes to reduce the human exposure to omcs in lettuce omc uptake reduction of ca 60 180 µg kg and 95 22 µg kg with respect to untreated sfcww 448 µg kg were obtained for crops irrigated with treated sfcww by solar and ozonation processes respectively moreover high uptake reductions were also attained in radish from 94 3 µg kg untreated water to 55 µg kg 42 when irrigated with solar treated sfcww and to 7 1 µg kg 92 5 for ozonated sfcww it is expected that a higher process efficiency would lead to a lower exposure of crops to omcs and consequently to a lower omc plant uptake such as it is clearly observed for ozonation with respect to solar technologies nevertheless this trend was not observed among the different solar processes in lettuce the fe3 eddha h2o2 solar process with 2 5 20 mg l of reagents showed the lowest omc uptake for radish non significant differences were observed between fe3 eddha h2o2 solar with 2 5 20 mg l and h2o2 solar therefore taking both crops into account the most efficient solar process was fe3 eddha h2o2 solar with 2 5 20 mg l the slight high uptake observed by the fe3 eddha h2o2 solar process in radish could be due to a higher induced metabolic activity as a result of the lower chlorophyll requirement of this non leafy vegetable and the metabolization of the iron fertilizer as an extra carbon source which can be translated to an increase in the uptake capability moreover omc concentrations in peat were analysed after crop harvesting results fig 2 also showed the capability of the selected processes to reduce the omc accumulation in the peat of both crops which reinforces their suitability to reduce and or prevent the environmental and health issues related to aquifers contamination omc percolation and the potential plant uptake in subsequent cultivation cycles respectively non significant differences were obtained in the different solar processes and ozonation was the most efficient technology by reducing 99 the accumulation of omcs furthermore omc concentrations detected in the peat used for both vegetables were similar as the cultivation cycle is longer for lettuces this peat was more exposed to omcs and therefore a higher omc presence is expected nevertheless the longer cultivation cycle which exposes omcs to a higher biotic degradation process in the rhizosphere environment as well as the higher omc uptake observed for this crop can balance this effect leading to the similar omc concentrations observed in both peats 3 2 2 bacterial load analysis the detection and or quantification of e coli o157 h7 and s enteritidis in crops and peat samples are shown in table 3 absence of both pathogens was observed in the negative control i e irrigated with mineral water data not shown the microbiological analysis of both crops irrigated with treated sfcww revealed the absence of both bacteria in all the analysed samples peat and plant tissues with exception of one positive sample by e coli o157 h7 lod in lettuce leaves for the h2o2 solar process and four positives by e coli o157 h7 in peat samples for the fe3 eddha h2o2 solar process with 2 5 20 mg l of reagents nevertheless this microbiological load detected meets the most restrictive requirement for vegetables 100 cfu g precut fruit and vegetables of the european regulation for foodstuffs in all the cases ec no 2073 2005 the presence of residual fenton reagents in the treated sfcww can promote an additional and beneficial bactericidal effect in the rhizosphere environment this effect can be correlated with the iron concentration detected and the microbiological load obtained in fe3 eddha h2o2 solar with 5 40 mg l a residual iron concentration was detected in peat 0 19 0 11 and 0 39 0 10 mg kg for lettuce and radish and consequently showed a total absence of both bacteria for the lower combination of reagents 2 5 20 mg l iron was not detected lod 0 045 mg kg and the peat of both crops showed some microbiological contamination table 3 on the contrary all the samples irrigated with untreated sfcww positive control showed a high concentration of both bacteria there was a higher bacterial load in peat than in crops as a consequence of the promoted survival of the microorganisms in a wet environment several studies have reported the capability of some pathogens e coli o157 h7 salmonella spp and listeria monocytogenes for their absorption from roots penetration in internal crop tissues translocation to edible plant tissues and survival up to the harvesting time ávila quezada et al 2010 chitarra et al 2014 murphy et al 2016 moreover environmental risks have been demonstrated such as the percolation capability until reaching aquifers of several pathogens including e coli o157 h7 and s typhimurium semenov et al 2009 higher bacterial load was determined in radish due to its direct contact with contaminated peat concentration of s enteritidis is higher than e coli o157 h7 in all the analysed samples this fact can be explained based on the higher survival capability of salmonella genus in non host and nutrient poor environments such as soils where it is ca 1 4 times longer lived than e coli o157 h7 and the higher association of this pathogen with plant stomata which is ca 1 8 times higher than e coli o157 h7 semenov et al 2009 van der linden et al 2016 3 2 3 chlorophyll content analysis despite iron is present at high concentrations in most soils its speciation in calcareous soils arid and semiarid regions leads to iron precipitation iron is an essential micronutrient for plants mainly related to the metabolism of photosynthetic pigments and chloroplast structures therefore its deficiency provokes alteration in the photosynthesis process leading to lower crop yield consequently fe3 eddha is usually added to the irrigation water as a source of iron that allows its bioavailability and avoids clogging problems iron precipitation in drip irrigation systems to determine the potential dual benefit of using the fe3 eddha as chelate agent for photo fenton treatment the foliar chlorophyll content type a and b was analysed in the harvested lettuces fig 3 the mean chlorophyll a b ratio determined 3 0 3 for all the evaluated samples is in agreement with the expected value for a c3 plant type such as lettuce parry et al 2014 chlorophyll content of the lettuces irrigated with water from fe3 eddha h2o2 solar treatment was almost twice the value obtained for the other evaluated processes h2o2 solar and ozone non significant differences were observed for the two reagents conditions of the fe3 eddha h2o2 solar process considering the previous results treated sfcww by fe3 eddha h2o2 solar process with the lowest reagent consumption 2 5 and 20 mg l is enough to guarantee an adequate chlorophyll content decreasing the risk of iron chlorosis disease 3 3 risk assessment 3 3 1 chemical risk assessment the adi and the edi values obtained for the 5 omcs in both harvested crops are shown in table s4 in general the edi values of lettuces were higher than those of radish these results are in accordance with both the higher serving size and the higher omc uptake showed by this leafy vegetable according to the obtained data where all the edi values were several orders of magnitude lower than the reference adi values the consumption of the harvested crops would not represent a chemical risk for the consumer regarding the estimated risk obtained from the exposure to the combination of 5 omcs the hq values for each omc and the combined risk hi values calculated for the harvested crops are presented in table 4 hq values ranged from 10 4 to 10 2 in the crops irrigated with untreated sfcww whereas for treated sfcww ranged from 10 6 to 10 4 for all the omcs with the exception of procymidone these findings are in agreement with a previous study camara et al 2017 the obtained hi values were 0 05 for all the harvested crops except for lettuces irrigated with untreated sfcww 0 132 as the hi values obtained were 1 their consumption would not pose any chemical health risk nevertheless the chemical risk associated to treated sfcww was significantly lower than risks associated to untreated sfcww being reduced at least 50 and more than one order of magnitude for radishes and lettuces respectively it is important to mention that the risk associated to their consumption is mainly due to procymidone the hq calculated for this compound represents ca 99 and ca 80 of the hi obtained with ozonated wastewater and the rest of crops untreated and solar treated respectively the risk associated to the other four omcs is almost irrelevant 3 3 2 microbiological risk assessment qmra results for the consumption of the crops irrigated by untreated and treated sfcww are shown in table 5 the results indicated a high risk associated with the consumption of the crops irrigated with untreated sfcww nevertheless the risk associated to crops contaminated by e coli o157 h7 is significantly higher 95 illnesses per 150 eating occasions and almost twice than the risk associated to s enteritidis 45 illnesses per 150 eating occasions these results can be explained based on the higher infectivity of e coli o157 h7 the health metric value implemented is almost three times the value of salmonella spp as acceptable values of the two main health risk metrics for crops consumption have not been established yet the data obtained in this study was compared with the very restricted limits internationally established for drinking water annual risk of illness 10 4 and dalys per person per year of 10 6 who 2008 u s epa 2006 for s enteritidis the results obtained comply with these parameters in both raw eaten crops whereas in the case of e coli o157 h7 the values obtained from qmra 10 3 for both health risk metrics are higher than the acceptable values for drinking water these results could be explained based on the higher infectivity of e coli o157 h7 0 143 dalys in comparison to s enteritidis 0 049 dalys and due to the conservative conditions implemented 100 of adverse effect probability and the non consideration of some scenarios which could reduce the bacterial load such as vegetable washing prior to consumption or pathogen die off rate however the microbiological risk associated with the consumption of both raw eaten crops irrigated by treated sfcww was reduced significantly more than 4 orders of magnitude this confirms the suitability of the studied technologies to reduce the microbiological risk associated to crops consumption 4 conclusions h2o2 solar fe3 eddha h2o2 solar and ozonation processes have demonstrated high efficacy and robustness to treat sfcww for agricultural reuse allowing to comply with the recent european regulation 2020 741 furthermore non phytotoxicity of the treated water and during its storage neither bacterial regrowth nor significant fluctuations in water characteristics were observed the employment of treated sfcww by all the studied technologies to cultivate two raw eaten crops radish and lettuce is able to significantly reduce both omc uptake reductions 90 for ozone and 40 for solar processes and pathogen load lod in the harvested crops chlorophyll levels were doubled using the commercial micronutrient fe3 eddha as an iron source to treat wastewater by the solar photo fenton process the chemical and microbiological risk assessment of the harvested crops has demonstrated the capability of the studied processes to reduce

16738,in this study a full cycle of agricultural reuse of agro food wastewater synthetic fresh cut wastewater sfcww at pilot plant scale has been investigated treated sfcww by ozonation and two solar processes h2o2 solar fe3 eddha h2o2 solar was used to irrigate two raw eaten crops lettuce and radish grown in peat two foodborne pathogens e coli o157 h7 and salmonella enteritidis and five organic microcontaminants omcs atrazine azoxystrobin buprofezin procymidone and terbutryn were monitored along the whole process the three studied processes showed a high treatment capability reaching microbial loads 7 cfu 100 ml and 21 90 of omc reduction robustness based on 7 or 10 analysed batches for each treatment process and high suitability for subsequent treated sfcww safe reuse non phytotoxic towards lactuca sativa and no bacterial regrowth during its storage for a week the analysis of the harvested crop samples irrigated with treated sfcww in all the studied processes showed an absence of microbial contamination limit of detection lod i e 1 cfu 99 g of lettuce and 1 cfu 8 g of radish a significant reduction of omc uptake in the range 40 60 and 90 for solar treated and ozonated sfcww respectively and bioaccumulation in both crops in comparison with the results obtained with untreated sfcww moreover the chlorophyll content in the harvested lettuces irrigated with sfcww treated by fe3 eddha h2o2 solar was twice than that irrigated with sfcww treated by h2o2 solar and ozone indicating the additional advantage of using fe3 eddha as an iron source to reduce the risk of iron chlorosis in crops finally the chemical dietary risk assessment for the combined exposure of the 5 omcs and quantitative microbiological risk assessment qmra of the harvested crops showed the capability of the studied processes to reduce the risk associated with untreated sfcww reuse by more than 50 and more than 4 orders of magnitude respectively graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords water storage in vivo reuse water disinfection risk assessment organic microcontaminants 1 introduction the increasing water scarcity turned reclaimed wastewater as a valued alternative water source for vegetable irrigation in arid and semiarid regions ungureanu et al 2020 agriculture is by far the largest water consumer and consequently its related industries agro food are also sectors with higher water consumption among these industries the growing fresh cut produce industry stands out due to the huge volumes of water needed to produce the marketed products mainly associated to the cultivation of short term salad crops ca 54 m3 per ton and their washing in the industrial processing line up to 11 m3 per ton perrin et al 2014 ölmez 2013 hence in view of the synergies between these sectors a transition to a circular economy by the reuse of wastewater from agro food industries in agriculture represents a sustainable strategy to reduce the water footprint of these industries and to guarantee future water and food availability in water scarce regions inyinbor et al 2019 nonetheless fresh cut wastewater fcww is associated to microbiological and chemical contamination derived from raw products making necessary its treatment for recycling in the own industrial processing or prior to its discharge reuse in line with this and in parallel to the recent fresh cut industry growth a remarkable increase in the number of worldwide outbreaks linked to leafy vegetable consumption has been reported mainly caused by the pathogenic bacteria e coli o157 h7 and salmonella spp kaczmarek et al 2019 callejón et al 2015 therefore to decrease the microbiological risk associated with the consumption of fresh cut products chlorinating the processing water is the most commonly applied strategy nevertheless as it is well known chlorination generates harmful disinfection by products dbps such as chlorates which can be directly transferred to fresh cut products during the industrial processing estimated ca 4 mg kg or indirectly by plant uptake if the chlorinated wastewater is reused estimated ca 0 5 mg kg representing a potential health risk for consumers gil et al 2016 garrido et al 2020 in addition fcww could be chemically contaminated mainly by pesticides at very low concentrations organic microcontaminants omcs these omcs can get accumulated during the industrial processing increasing the environmental and health risk associated to the subsequent discharge or reuse of wastewater as the chlorination stage has proven not to be efficient in their removal kong et al 2020 these current concerns have led to a marked increase in the search and evaluation of alternative water treatments bilek and turantas 2013 although most of these treatments are mainly focused on the inactivation of foodborne pathogens and do not take omcs into account meireles et al 2016 artés hernández et al 2017 ozonation is one of the most promising treatments for chlorination replacement due to several reasons such as its approved use for food contact its in situ generation efficiency against a wider range of microorganisms than chlorination and its decomposition without leaving residues tomas and tiwari 2013 nevertheless dbp generation and the high operating cost of ozonation mainly related to electric consumption have forced the interest on searching for cheaper and more sustainable alternatives in this regard the capability of uv a irradiation 320 400 nm from both natural sunlight or lamps in combination with chemical agents to promote the formation of highly reactive species and the high water disinfection efficiency showed by photochemical and photocatalytic processes has led to consider them as feasible alternatives cossu et al 2018 among the different solar driven technologies the solar photo fenton process is an outstanding choice as a homogeneous advanced oxidation process aop based on the generation of the powerful hydroxyl radicals ho through the decomposition of h2o2 by using iron salts as a catalyst this solar driven aop has demonstrated a high disinfection and decontamination capability in multiple water matrices including agro food wastewater carra et al 2015 nevertheless the optimal process efficiency is attained at acidic operating conditions 2 8 which increases the treatment cost representing one of its main drawbacks as a result in recent years searching and evaluating alternative iron sources or complexing agents that could maintain iron in solution at near neutral ph has grown recent studies have demonstrated the capability of the commercial iron fertilizer fe3 eddha ethylenediamine n n bis 2 hydroxyphenylacetic acid for the treatment of sfcww nahim granados et al 2020a this iron chelate is commonly used in mediterranean agriculture to increase iron bioavailability for plants and avoid plant disease known as iron chlorosis therefore its implementation in a circular system for water reclamation and reuse represents a plausible and attractive option to simultaneously tackling two important problems water stress and iron chlorosis another solar driven process able to be applied at neutral ph which has shown high wastewater disinfection efficiencies is the solar photo inactivation process assisted with low concentrations of h2o2 known as h2o2 solar process this simple photochemical process is able to improve the inactivation kinetic of several microorganisms based on synergistic effects between solar photo oxidative damages and internal oxidative mechanisms giannakis et al 2016 finally it is important to highlight that although regulations of water reuse have been recently established with the aim of decreasing the human and environmental risks related to this practice regulation eu 2020 741 several knowledge gaps are still under investigation and more experimental studies are needed in order to evaluate them including the microbial regrowth during treated water storage potential translocation bioaccumulation of omcs to crops and soils and human health risks associated with the consumer exposition to microbial and chemical pollutants through the food crop chain ikehata 2013 thus this study aims to 1 assess the feasibility of two solar driven technologies h2o2 solar and solar photo fenton with fe3 eddha and a conventional commercial treatment ozonation to improve the microbiological e coli o157 h7 and salmonella enteritidis and chemical five omcs quality of sfcww at pilot plant scale by monitoring the treatment performance phytotoxicity

regulation eu 2020 741 results in agreement with aguas et al where the lod for e coli spp salmonella spp enterococcus spp and total coliforms present in uww effluents were reached after 300 min of solar treatment by h2o2 solar 20 mg l and solar photo fenton 10 20 mg l of fe2 h2o2 aguas et al 2019 total load of omcs was reduced but they were still present in the treated sfcww by all the technologies and conditions evaluated as was previously reported by several different water treatment technologies activated carbon o3 uv and solar technologies rizzo et al 2020 removal was significantly higher for ozonation 90 than for all solar processes 50 without significant differences between the evaluated solar processes the results are in agreement with the higher oxidative capability of the ozonation process and the mild oxidative conditions implemented for the two studied solar processes only 2 5 mg l of iron and 20 mg l of h2o2 as expected these results are in accordance with previous studies reporting sfcww disinfection and decontamination under similar operational conditions reaching a slightly better treatment performance from all solar tested processes fe3 eddha h2o2 solar at 2 5 20 mg l of reagent concentration nahim granados et al 2020a 2020b it also supports the robustness of solar processes to treat sfcww in real and fluctuating weather conditions table s1 3 1 2 storage monitoring water storage is a key matter in wastewater reclamation if the applied process did not meet correctly the microbicidal dose and even more considering that its organic matter content is able to feed microorganisms empowering the risks of reactivation and growth conversely the presence of a residual oxidant concentration can inhibit these potential risks li et al 2013 therefore an exhaustive monitoring of the treated sfcww was carried out after 3 and 7 days of storage in darkness and at 4 c omc concentration did not show significant differences in any case in comparison with the final concentration detected in each treated sfcww batch data not shown regarding microbial contamination no regrowth was observed for any bacteria and tested condition fig 1 remaining the bacterial concentrations below lod for wastewater reclamation 10 cfu 100 ml regulation eu 2020 741 the presence of a residual oxidant concentration can contribute to avoiding bacterial regrowth while the remaining iron concentration in solution is one of the treatment strengths of the fe3 eddha h2o2 solar process as it constitutes an additional iron source useful for vegetable metabolism the concentration profile of both reagents during solar treated sfcww storage is presented in fig s1 non significant differences in dissolved iron concentration were observed 1 49 0 03 and 0 34 0 02 mg l for 2 5 and 5 mg l of fe3 eddha respectively conversely a significant and similar decrease was observed for h2o2 in the three studied conditions h2o2 solar and fe3 eddha h2o2 solar process with both reagent combinations 26 2 and 37 2 for 3 and 7 storage days respectively data suggest that in our case the h2o2 decomposition process during treated water storage is not related to the applied treatment and therefore neither to the water matrix used 3 1 3 phytotoxicity assessment phytotoxicity results are shown in table 2 in general non significant phytotoxicity effects were observed in any treated sfcww by ozone and solar processes as well as in untreated sfcww therefore the selected omcs the residual h2o2 concentration and any chemical degradation products from omcs and or the iron chelate can be discarded as potential harmful substances for crops cultivation similar results regarding absence of toxic effect of omcs at 100 µg l towards root elongation have been reported in literature margenat et al 2017 supporting the findings obtained in our study opposite to our results in previous works where toxicity of treated sfcww by ozonation and fe3 eddha h2o2 solar process was assessed but using vibrio fischeri as model of environmental toxicity test a slight toxic effect was detected nahim granados et al 2020a 2020b therefore the importance of the test and the organism selected depending on the intended end use of the treated wastewater is crucial to give a realistic potential toxicity risk although the rgi value obtained for ozonation and fe3 eddha h2o2 solar process at both conditions samples showed non significant phytotoxicity 1 10 to 1 20 the higher rgi values with respect to untreated sfcww 1 07 can be explained based on the presence of more quantity of assimilable organic matter derived from low molecular weight fractions from ozonation process or the fertilization derived from the iron chelate addition finally it is important to mention that stimulation and inhibition results are observed for treated sfcww by h2o2 solar and chlorination 100 mg l processes respectively the stimulation effect rgi value 1 2 observed after the h2o2 solar process could be due to the presence of a high residual h2o2 concentration 13 mg l that could act in different ways 1 providing protection from potential microbial infections 2 weakening the endosperm cap accelerating the seed germination process wojtyla et al 2016 and 3 generating additional oxygenation to the seedling after its decomposition liu et al 2012 the inhibition effect showed by the chlorinated sfcww can be due to both the presence of residual chlorine and or toxic chlorinated dbps lonigro et al 2017 this highlights the suitability of the proposed treatments as alternatives to chlorination for further use in crop irrigation 3 2 evaluation of harvested crops 3 2 1 organic microcontaminants analysis fig 2 shows omc concentrations in both raw eaten crops irrigated with treated and untreated sfcww results demonstrated that all the omcs were uptaken by both types of vegetables the omc uptake pathway is mainly attributed to root uptake diffusion through the vascular system phloem and or xylem and further translocation to aboveground tissues by the transpiration derived mass flow christou et al 2019 taking into account the pk a values of the target omcs from 0 9 to 6 7 table s3 all of them are neutral species in both peat solution ph 7 and plant system ph from 5 5 in vacuoles and sap xylem to 7 in the cytoplasm due to its neutral character they are easily absorbed and translocated in both environments thus avoiding the electrical repulsion with cell membranes usually observed for ionic species christou et al 2019 martínez piernas et al 2018b another important descriptor is their lipophilicity log k ow polar omcs i e log k ow value between 1 and 5 favours the absorption and transport of chemical compounds aguas et al 2019 based on the log k ow values of the target compounds from 2 5 to 4 93 table s3 and in agreement with the obtained results the uptake and translocation of the five selected omcs can also be explained nevertheless differences in the uptake and translocation rates of different omcs are usually observed due to their passage through the different plant structures is also dependent on the especific chemical structure and chemical polarity configuration of each omc molecular weight electronegative groups and polar surface area the presence of high electronegative groups such as chlorine in omc structures low molecular weight 300 and a small polar surface area have been reported as chemical characteristics that favour the uptake and translocation of omcs characteristics which are in agreement with the higher concentrations observed in this study for atz and pcm in both vegetables table s3 and fig 2 brooke et al 1986 eggen et al 2013 a higher omc load in lettuce than in radish was observed lettuces are leafy vegetables which present a high transpiration stream to leaves transpiration organs in comparison with the stream towards roots or fruits of other vegetables which favours the translocation and accumulation of omcs aguas et al 2019 martínez piernas et al 2018b besides and although the uptake capacity of roots is lower than in leafy vegetables radish is in direct contact with the soil containing omcs enabling their penetration in root crops and consequently a high omc accumulation was also observed for this raw eaten crop christou et al 2019 regarding the efficiency of the studied oxidation processes to reduce the human exposure to omcs in lettuce omc uptake reduction of ca 60 180 µg kg and 95 22 µg kg with respect to untreated sfcww 448 µg kg were obtained for crops irrigated with treated sfcww by solar and ozonation processes respectively moreover high uptake reductions were also attained in radish from 94 3 µg kg untreated water to 55 µg kg 42 when irrigated with solar treated sfcww and to 7 1 µg kg 92 5 for ozonated sfcww it is expected that a higher process efficiency would lead to a lower exposure of crops to omcs and consequently to a lower omc plant uptake such as it is clearly observed for ozonation with respect to solar technologies nevertheless this trend was not observed among the different solar processes in lettuce the fe3 eddha h2o2 solar process with 2 5 20 mg l of reagents showed the lowest omc uptake for radish non significant differences were observed between fe3 eddha h2o2 solar with 2 5 20 mg l and h2o2 solar therefore taking both crops into account the most efficient solar process was fe3 eddha h2o2 solar with 2 5 20 mg l the slight high uptake observed by the fe3 eddha h2o2 solar process in radish could be due to a higher induced metabolic activity as a result of the lower chlorophyll requirement of this non leafy vegetable and the metabolization of the iron fertilizer as an extra carbon source which can be translated to an increase in the uptake capability moreover omc concentrations in peat were analysed after crop harvesting results fig 2 also showed the capability of the selected processes to reduce the omc accumulation in the peat of both crops which reinforces their suitability to reduce and or prevent the environmental and health issues related to aquifers contamination omc percolation and the potential plant uptake in subsequent cultivation cycles respectively non significant differences were obtained in the different solar processes and ozonation was the most efficient technology by reducing 99 the accumulation of omcs furthermore omc concentrations detected in the peat used for both vegetables were similar as the cultivation cycle is longer for lettuces this peat was more exposed to omcs and therefore a higher omc presence is expected nevertheless the longer cultivation cycle which exposes omcs to a higher biotic degradation process in the rhizosphere environment as well as the higher omc uptake observed for this crop can balance this effect leading to the similar omc concentrations observed in both peats 3 2 2 bacterial load analysis the detection and or quantification of e coli o157 h7 and s enteritidis in crops and peat samples are shown in table 3 absence of both pathogens was observed in the negative control i e irrigated with mineral water data not shown the microbiological analysis of both crops irrigated with treated sfcww revealed the absence of both bacteria in all the analysed samples peat and plant tissues with exception of one positive sample by e coli o157 h7 lod in lettuce leaves for the h2o2 solar process and four positives by e coli o157 h7 in peat samples for the fe3 eddha h2o2 solar process with 2 5 20 mg l of reagents nevertheless this microbiological load detected meets the most restrictive requirement for vegetables 100 cfu g precut fruit and vegetables of the european regulation for foodstuffs in all the cases ec no 2073 2005 the presence of residual fenton reagents in the treated sfcww can promote an additional and beneficial bactericidal effect in the rhizosphere environment this effect can be correlated with the iron concentration detected and the microbiological load obtained in fe3 eddha h2o2 solar with 5 40 mg l a residual iron concentration was detected in peat 0 19 0 11 and 0 39 0 10 mg kg for lettuce and radish and consequently showed a total absence of both bacteria for the lower combination of reagents 2 5 20 mg l iron was not detected lod 0 045 mg kg and the peat of both crops showed some microbiological contamination table 3 on the contrary all the samples irrigated with untreated sfcww positive control showed a high concentration of both bacteria there was a higher bacterial load in peat than in crops as a consequence of the promoted survival of the microorganisms in a wet environment several studies have reported the capability of some pathogens e coli o157 h7 salmonella spp and listeria monocytogenes for their absorption from roots penetration in internal crop tissues translocation to edible plant tissues and survival up to the harvesting time ávila quezada et al 2010 chitarra et al 2014 murphy et al 2016 moreover environmental risks have been demonstrated such as the percolation capability until reaching aquifers of several pathogens including e coli o157 h7 and s typhimurium semenov et al 2009 higher bacterial load was determined in radish due to its direct contact with contaminated peat concentration of s enteritidis is higher than e coli o157 h7 in all the analysed samples this fact can be explained based on the higher survival capability of salmonella genus in non host and nutrient poor environments such as soils where it is ca 1 4 times longer lived than e coli o157 h7 and the higher association of this pathogen with plant stomata which is ca 1 8 times higher than e coli o157 h7 semenov et al 2009 van der linden et al 2016 3 2 3 chlorophyll content analysis despite iron is present at high concentrations in most soils its speciation in calcareous soils arid and semiarid regions leads to iron precipitation iron is an essential micronutrient for plants mainly related to the metabolism of photosynthetic pigments and chloroplast structures therefore its deficiency provokes alteration in the photosynthesis process leading to lower crop yield consequently fe3 eddha is usually added to the irrigation water as a source of iron that allows its bioavailability and avoids clogging problems iron precipitation in drip irrigation systems to determine the potential dual benefit of using the fe3 eddha as chelate agent for photo fenton treatment the foliar chlorophyll content type a and b was analysed in the harvested lettuces fig 3 the mean chlorophyll a b ratio determined 3 0 3 for all the evaluated samples is in agreement with the expected value for a c3 plant type such as lettuce parry et al 2014 chlorophyll content of the lettuces irrigated with water from fe3 eddha h2o2 solar treatment was almost twice the value obtained for the other evaluated processes h2o2 solar and ozone non significant differences were observed for the two reagents conditions of the fe3 eddha h2o2 solar process considering the previous results treated sfcww by fe3 eddha h2o2 solar process with the lowest reagent consumption 2 5 and 20 mg l is enough to guarantee an adequate chlorophyll content decreasing the risk of iron chlorosis disease 3 3 risk assessment 3 3 1 chemical risk assessment the adi and the edi values obtained for the 5 omcs in both harvested crops are shown in table s4 in general the edi values of lettuces were higher than those of radish these results are in accordance with both the higher serving size and the higher omc uptake showed by this leafy vegetable according to the obtained data where all the edi values were several orders of magnitude lower than the reference adi values the consumption of the harvested crops would not represent a chemical risk for the consumer regarding the estimated risk obtained from the exposure to the combination of 5 omcs the hq values for each omc and the combined risk hi values calculated for the harvested crops are presented in table 4 hq values ranged from 10 4 to 10 2 in the crops irrigated with untreated sfcww whereas for treated sfcww ranged from 10 6 to 10 4 for all the omcs with the exception of procymidone these findings are in agreement with a previous study camara et al 2017 the obtained hi values were 0 05 for all the harvested crops except for lettuces irrigated with untreated sfcww 0 132 as the hi values obtained were 1 their consumption would not pose any chemical health risk nevertheless the chemical risk associated to treated sfcww was significantly lower than risks associated to untreated sfcww being reduced at least 50 and more than one order of magnitude for radishes and lettuces respectively it is important to mention that the risk associated to their consumption is mainly due to procymidone the hq calculated for this compound represents ca 99 and ca 80 of the hi obtained with ozonated wastewater and the rest of crops untreated and solar treated respectively the risk associated to the other four omcs is almost irrelevant 3 3 2 microbiological risk assessment qmra results for the consumption of the crops irrigated by untreated and treated sfcww are shown in table 5 the results indicated a high risk associated with the consumption of the crops irrigated with untreated sfcww nevertheless the risk associated to crops contaminated by e coli o157 h7 is significantly higher 95 illnesses per 150 eating occasions and almost twice than the risk associated to s enteritidis 45 illnesses per 150 eating occasions these results can be explained based on the higher infectivity of e coli o157 h7 the health metric value implemented is almost three times the value of salmonella spp as acceptable values of the two main health risk metrics for crops consumption have not been established yet the data obtained in this study was compared with the very restricted limits internationally established for drinking water annual risk of illness 10 4 and dalys per person per year of 10 6 who 2008 u s epa 2006 for s enteritidis the results obtained comply with these parameters in both raw eaten crops whereas in the case of e coli o157 h7 the values obtained from qmra 10 3 for both health risk metrics are higher than the acceptable values for drinking water these results could be explained based on the higher infectivity of e coli o157 h7 0 143 dalys in comparison to s enteritidis 0 049 dalys and due to the conservative conditions implemented 100 of adverse effect probability and the non consideration of some scenarios which could reduce the bacterial load such as vegetable washing prior to consumption or pathogen die off rate however the microbiological risk associated with the consumption of both raw eaten crops irrigated by treated sfcww was reduced significantly more than 4 orders of magnitude this confirms the suitability of the studied technologies to reduce the microbiological risk associated to crops consumption 4 conclusions h2o2 solar fe3 eddha h2o2 solar and ozonation processes have demonstrated high efficacy and robustness to treat sfcww for agricultural reuse allowing to comply with the recent european regulation 2020 741 furthermore non phytotoxicity of the treated water and during its storage neither bacterial regrowth nor significant fluctuations in water characteristics were observed the employment of treated sfcww by all the studied technologies to cultivate two raw eaten crops radish and lettuce is able to significantly reduce both omc uptake reductions 90 for ozone and 40 for solar processes and pathogen load lod in the harvested crops chlorophyll levels were doubled using the commercial micronutrient fe3 eddha as an iron source to treat wastewater by the solar photo fenton process the chemical and microbiological risk assessment of the harvested crops has demonstrated the capability of the studied processes to reduce

16739,widespread increases in organic matter om content of surface waters as measured by color and organic carbon oc are a major issue for aquatic ecosystems long term monitoring programs revealed the issue of brownification with climate change land cover changes and recovery from acidification all suspected to be major drivers or contributing factors while many studies have focused on the impact and drivers fewer have followed up on whether brownification is continuing as time series of om data lengthen conventional data analysis approaches miss important information on when changes occur to better identify temporal om patterns during three decades 1990 2020 of systematic monitoring we used generalized additive models to analyze 164 time series from watercourses located across sweden increases in oc that were widespread during 1990 2010 ceased a decade ago and most color increases ceased 20 years ago these findings highlight the need to reassess the understanding of brownification

al 2004 the starting points for these increases varied from the 1960 s worrall et al 2003 worrall et al 2004 to 1980 s 1990 s driscoll et al 2003 evans et al 2006 evans et al 2005 monteith et al 2007 since then there have been predictions that this om increase often referred to as brownification will continue de wit et al 2016 kritzberg 2017 škerlep et al 2020 weyhenmeyer et al 2012 numerous studies have pointed out the serious ecological and water quality implications of this brownification such as changes in aquatic food web structures nutrient availability ph and metal speciation as well as thermal stratification creed et al 2018 karlsson et al 2009 nova et al 2019 elevated om concentrations can also have negative effects on drinking water treatment bieroza et al 2009 krasner et

monteith et al 2007 redden et al 2021 sanclements et al 2012 other studies suggested that additional factors related to climate change land use and biomass increases also contributed to brownification of many surface waters de wit et al 2016 erlandsson et al 2008 finstad et al 2016 kritzberg 2017 meyer jacob et al 2019 škerlep et al 2020 weyhenmeyer et al 2012 weyhenmeyer and karlsson 2009 if recovery from acidification is the main driver for the observed trends in om that would imply that the increasing trends would end as acidification recovery culminates other drivers will be continuing such as changing climate or at least have no clearly demarcated endpoint such as biomass increases or land use bragée et al 2015 many of the initial publications using oc as a proxy for surface water

finland lepistö et al 2021 räike et al 2016 northeastern us lapierre et al 2021 and nova scotia redden et al 2021 have found continued browning in a majority of the sites studied as data records lengthen the challenge of analyzing the records is also increasing a commonly used statistical method to test for temporal trends in environmental data are non parametric mann kendall tests since these tests are robust can easily handle outliers and only require trends to be monotonic but not linear such mann kendall tests were also used in many of the above cited research papers to determine if om trends were present during pre defined time periods meyer jacob et al 2019 räike et al 2016 worrall et al 2020 this is however an approach that does not retain any information about the exact shape of the trend and its results can be dependent on the time periods chosen for analysis to improve the evaluation refined statistical methods using smoothing methods like generalized additive mixed models gamm hastie and tibshirani 1986 wood 2017 have been increasingly used to model temporal trends for long time series these do not require a priori assumptions about the shape of the trends and allow for evaluation of when changes have occurred during the study period the aim of this study was to determine whether the brownification previously observed is continuing by evaluating three decades of om data from 164 watercourses across sweden using gamm the catchments all with minimal influence from urban or point source pollution covered a latitudinal extent of 1600 km a range of land cover historic acid deposition levels and climatic zones from temperate to boreal and arctic made these data well suited to assessing how extensive brownification remains in space and time 2 methods 2 1 data selection this study included water chemistry data from 164 watercourses within the swedish national monitoring program miljödata mvm 2021 fölster et al 2014 the sampling locations extended across 13 of latitude 55 27 to 68 21 catchment sizes ranged from 11 km2 10th percentile to 11 532 km2 90th percentile with a median size of 214 km2 table s1 the mean annual precipitation for each site ranged from 450 mm in the north east to 1235 mm in the south west of sweden mean annual temperature ranged from 1 9 c in the north to 8 9 c in the south of sweden the watercourses were sampled for up to 31 years between january 1990 and december 2020 for total organic carbon toc and absorbance at a wave length of 420 nm hereafter referred to as colored dissolved organic matter cdom of these watercourses 65 toc and 101 cdom were sampled in 1990 and 156 toc and cdom in 2020 with 27 toc and 28 cdom years being the average consecutive duration of each time series the sampling frequency was monthly for a majority of sites n 117 up to twice a month in some sites n 37 and down to bi monthly in a smaller set of sites n 10 all the chemical analyses were carried out at the department of aquatic sciences and assessment at the swedish university of agricultural sciences https www slu se en departments aquatic sciences assessment the field and laboratory methodologies are standardized and well documented the fact that the same laboratory has analyzed the samples over the entire period 1990 2020 has led to a high level of consistency in the current study toc concentration and cdom data were evaluated the laboratory is certified swedac for analyses of toc and cdom the toc was measured by combustion methods following standard methods ss en 1484 the absorbance at 420 nm was measured on filtered water with spectrophotometric methods ss en iso 7887 2012 organic carbon was measured as toc which contains 90 doc humborg et al 2010 so while the organic carbon concentrations reported are toc these can be considered equivalent to doc the ratio between cdom and toc the specific visible spectrum vis absorbance svisa was calculated as a measure of om quality with a high svisa indicating more colored om 2 2 statistical analyses analysis of station wise trends was conducted using generalized additive mixed models gamm hastie and tibshirani 1986 wood 2017 this approach allows the modeling of environmental timeseries without prior definition of the shape of the trend curve the time trend in toc cdom and svisa were analyzed using a thin plate spline while the seasonal component was modeled by a cyclic cubic regression spline with an annual period as observations must be assumed to be dependent in time the error term includes a continuous autoregressive process of lag 1 ar 1 first derivatives of the smoothed trend and the corresponding confidence bands were used to determine if a trend was significant at any given time point monteith et al 2014 simpson 2018 the obtained information was summarized and visualized according to the suggestions in von brömssen et al 2021 3 results and discussion 3 1 temporal trends in organic carbon concentrations the observed trends in toc concentrations and cdom over the last three decades were neither linear nor monotonic across the data set of swedish watercourses the gamm based trend analyses indicated that a majority of the sites increased significantly in toc concentration for some parts of the period 1990 2010 fig s1 there was also a clear pattern of stronger increases in toc during two specific time periods of 3 5 years each centered around 1996 and 2007 fig 1 fig s1 during the latter peak 2005 2008 up to 50 of the watercourses had increasing trends in toc while the trends were not uniform over the period 1990 2010 fig s1 the gamm analyses detected a breakpoint at about 2010 after 2010 increasing trends of toc were detected in less than 20 of the watercourses fig 1 this means that while toc concentrations increased in many areas between 1990 and 2010 the toc concentrations have been more stable during the past decade fig 3 the cessation of increases in cdom is just as abrupt but came even earlier the trends in cdom followed that of toc quite well up to 2000 but then flattened when less than 20 of the sites had increasing cdom trends fig 1 the share of sites with increasing cdom trends have gradually decreased since 2000 after 2010 less than 10 of the sites had increasing trends and approximately the same amount of sites had decreasing trends for a shorter period of time around 2008 2017 thus brownification either has ceased across much of the country or has at least been put on hold temporal patterns in toc concentrations from eight example sites fig 2 illustrated the trend characteristics for a majority of all sites toc increases were present during distinct time periods or during the whole period up to 2010 and then flatten out fig 2c e or declined fig 2a most of the sites that still show an increase in toc after 2010 were identified by the gamm analyses as linear trends see for example fig 2b this means that for these sites there has been a general increase in toc over the whole time period and not specifically during the period after 2010 appropriate statistical methods need to be used when such complex time trends are described while the analysis using gamm allowed us to describe how toc trends changed during different periods more commonly used methods such as the mann kendall test summarize trends over the entire available time period applied to our data such an approach would have shown that most of the toc series and a large proportion of cdom series have had an upward trend 119 for toc and 70 for cdom out of the total of 164 series such an analysis would correctly identify the watercourses where toc or cdom had increased but fail to identify when the increases occurred as a consequence such results might lead to the misconception that brownification was still ongoing 3 2 temporal trends in organic carbon quality the fact that the trends of toc and cdom differed indicated a shift in om quality over time the characteristics of om as indicated by cdom normalized by toc svisa is a tantalizing clue that may also provide some insight into the factors changing surface water carbon from 1990 to 2000 there were more sites with increasing svisa than sites with decreasing trends fig 1 but since 2000 svisa has decreased in around 10 30 of the sites with almost no sites showing increasing trends a shift in surface water om quality over time has been detected in earlier studies of uk catchments influenced by urban areas worrall and burt 2010 however those temporal patterns differed from the patterns found in the catchments of the present study where urban areas had very limited influence if any a decoupling of doc and color was also identified in lakes of northeastern us lapierre et al 2021 and norway hongve et al 2004 this could indicate different drivers for the colored fraction of om the om quality results also demonstrate that trends of brownification are not straightforward and depend on whether it is color or oc that is considered 3 3 potential drivers for om trends multiple drivers may have contributed to the rising toc concentrations prior to 2010 when such trends were more widespread hence it is challenging to distinguish the relative importance of causes for the toc trends or lack thereof observed during the past decade a systematic investigation of the available evidence to answer this such as the full range of chemical constituents besides toc as well as changes in catchment land use and biomass soils and climate patterns were outside the scope of this paper that aims to assess the duration and extent of brownification in sweden nonetheless the spatial and temporal patterns of toc concentrations across three decades can be used to speculate on the potential drivers the fact that brownification has been put on hold since 2010 in most areas of sweden could imply that acidification recovery has been one of the major factors driving the trends in toc after 1990 it could also be that certain climate factors such as seasonal variation in precipitation and temperature may be driving trends that are less monotonic in time and space than recovery

16739,widespread increases in organic matter om content of surface waters as measured by color and organic carbon oc are a major issue for aquatic ecosystems long term monitoring programs revealed the issue of brownification with climate change land cover changes and recovery from acidification all suspected to be major drivers or contributing factors while many studies have focused on the impact and drivers fewer have followed up on whether brownification is continuing as time series of om data lengthen conventional data analysis approaches miss important information on when changes occur to better identify temporal om patterns during three decades 1990 2020 of systematic monitoring we used generalized additive models to analyze 164 time series from watercourses located across sweden increases in oc that were widespread during 1990 2010 ceased a decade ago and most color increases ceased 20 years ago these findings highlight the need to reassess the understanding of brownification

since then there have been predictions that this om increase often referred to as brownification will continue de wit et al 2016 kritzberg 2017 škerlep et al 2020 weyhenmeyer et al 2012 numerous studies have pointed out the serious ecological and water quality implications of this brownification such as changes in aquatic food web structures nutrient availability ph and metal speciation as well as thermal stratification creed et al 2018 karlsson et al 2009 nova et al 2019 elevated om concentrations can also have negative effects on drinking water treatment bieroza et al 2009 krasner et

monteith et al 2007 redden et al 2021 sanclements et al 2012 other studies suggested that additional factors related to climate change land use and biomass increases also contributed to brownification of many surface waters de wit et al 2016 erlandsson et al 2008 finstad et al 2016 kritzberg 2017 meyer jacob et al 2019 škerlep et al 2020 weyhenmeyer et al 2012 weyhenmeyer and karlsson 2009 if recovery from acidification is the main driver for the observed trends in om that would imply that the increasing trends would end as acidification recovery culminates other drivers will be continuing such as changing climate or at least have no clearly demarcated endpoint such as biomass increases or land use bragée et al 2015 many of the initial publications using oc as a proxy for surface water

2015 meyer jacob et al 2019 surface water monitoring programs have been continuing so now three decades of systematic oc concentration and quality measures e g various absorbance metrics are becoming available hitherto though few studies have followed up on whether areas where geographically widespread brownification has previously been reported are continuing to brownify those few follow ups from finland lepistö et al 2021 räike et al 2016 northeastern us lapierre et al 2021 and nova scotia redden et al 2021 have found continued browning in a majority of the sites studied as data records lengthen the challenge of analyzing the records is also increasing a commonly used statistical method to test for temporal trends in environmental data are non parametric mann kendall tests since these tests are robust can easily handle outliers and only require trends to be monotonic but not linear such mann kendall tests were also used in many of the above cited research papers to determine if om trends were present during pre defined time periods meyer jacob et al 2019 räike et al 2016 worrall et al 2020 this is however an approach that does not retain any information about the exact shape of the trend and its results can be dependent on the time periods chosen for analysis to improve the evaluation refined statistical methods using smoothing methods like generalized additive mixed models gamm hastie and tibshirani 1986 wood 2017 have been increasingly used to model temporal trends for long time series these do not require a priori assumptions about the shape of the trends and allow for evaluation of when changes have occurred during the study period the aim of this study was to determine whether the brownification previously observed is continuing by evaluating three decades of om data from 164 watercourses across sweden using gamm the catchments all with minimal influence from urban or point source pollution covered a latitudinal extent of 1600 km a range of land cover historic acid deposition levels and climatic zones from temperate to boreal and arctic made these data well suited to assessing how extensive brownification remains in space and time 2 methods 2 1 data selection this study included water chemistry data from 164 watercourses within the swedish national monitoring program miljödata mvm 2021 fölster et al 2014 the sampling locations extended across 13 of latitude 55 27 to 68 21 catchment sizes ranged from 11 km2 10th percentile to 11 532 km2 90th percentile with a median size of 214 km2 table s1 the mean annual precipitation for each site ranged from 450 mm in the north east to 1235 mm in the south west of sweden mean annual temperature ranged from 1 9 c in the north to 8 9 c in the south of sweden the watercourses were sampled for up to 31 years between january 1990 and december 2020 for total organic carbon toc and absorbance at a wave length of 420 nm hereafter referred to as colored dissolved organic matter cdom of these watercourses 65 toc and 101 cdom were sampled in 1990 and 156 toc and cdom in 2020 with 27 toc and 28 cdom years being the average consecutive duration of each time series the sampling frequency was monthly for a majority of sites n 117 up to twice a month in some sites n 37 and down to bi monthly in a smaller set of sites n 10 all the chemical analyses were carried out at the department of aquatic sciences and assessment at the swedish university of agricultural sciences https www slu se en departments aquatic sciences assessment the field and laboratory methodologies are standardized and well documented the fact that the same laboratory has analyzed the samples over the entire period 1990 2020 has led to a high level of consistency in the current study toc concentration and cdom data were evaluated the laboratory is certified swedac for analyses of toc and cdom the toc was measured by combustion methods following standard methods ss en 1484 the absorbance at 420 nm was measured on filtered water with spectrophotometric methods ss en iso 7887 2012 organic carbon was measured as toc which contains 90 doc humborg et al 2010 so while the organic carbon concentrations reported are toc these can be considered equivalent to doc the ratio between cdom and toc the specific visible spectrum vis absorbance svisa was calculated as a measure of om quality with a high svisa indicating more colored om 2 2 statistical analyses analysis of station wise trends was conducted using generalized additive mixed models gamm hastie and tibshirani 1986 wood 2017 this approach allows the modeling of environmental timeseries without prior definition of the shape of the trend curve the time trend in toc cdom and svisa were analyzed using a thin plate spline while the seasonal component was modeled by a cyclic cubic regression spline with an annual period as observations must be assumed to be dependent in time the error term includes a continuous autoregressive process of lag 1 ar 1 first derivatives of the smoothed trend and the corresponding confidence bands were used to determine if a trend was significant at any given time point monteith et al 2014 simpson 2018 the obtained information was summarized and visualized according to the suggestions in von brömssen et al 2021 3 results and discussion 3 1 temporal trends in organic carbon concentrations the observed trends in toc concentrations and cdom over the last three decades were neither linear nor monotonic across the data set of swedish watercourses the gamm based trend analyses indicated that a majority of the sites increased significantly in toc concentration for some parts of the period 1990 2010 fig s1 there was also a clear pattern of stronger increases in toc during two specific time periods of 3 5 years each centered around 1996 and 2007 fig 1 fig s1 during the latter peak 2005 2008 up to 50 of the watercourses had increasing trends in toc while the trends were not uniform over the period 1990 2010 fig s1 the gamm analyses detected a breakpoint at about 2010 after 2010 increasing trends of toc were detected in less than 20 of the watercourses fig 1 this means that while toc concentrations increased in many areas between 1990 and 2010 the toc concentrations have been more stable during the past decade fig 3 the cessation of increases in cdom is just as abrupt but came even earlier the trends in cdom followed that of toc quite well up to 2000 but then flattened when less than 20 of the sites had increasing cdom trends fig 1 the share of sites with increasing cdom trends have gradually decreased since 2000 after 2010 less than 10 of the sites had increasing trends and approximately the same amount of sites had decreasing trends for a shorter period of time around 2008 2017 thus brownification either has ceased across much of the country or has at least been put on hold temporal patterns in toc concentrations from eight example sites fig 2 illustrated the trend characteristics for a majority of all sites toc increases were present during distinct time periods or during the whole period up to 2010 and then flatten out fig 2c e or declined fig 2a most of the sites that still show an increase in toc after 2010 were identified by the gamm analyses as linear trends see for example fig 2b this means that for these sites there has been a general increase in toc over the whole time period and not specifically during the period after 2010 appropriate statistical methods need to be used when such complex time trends are described while the analysis using gamm allowed us to describe how toc trends changed during different periods more commonly used methods such as the mann kendall test summarize trends over the entire available time period applied to our data such an approach would have shown that most of the toc series and a large proportion of cdom series have had an upward trend 119 for toc and 70 for cdom out of the total of 164 series such an analysis would correctly identify the watercourses where toc or cdom had increased but fail to identify when the increases occurred as a consequence such results might lead to the misconception that brownification was still ongoing 3 2 temporal trends in organic carbon quality the fact that the trends of toc and cdom differed indicated a shift in om quality over time the characteristics of om as indicated by cdom normalized by toc svisa is a tantalizing clue that may also provide some insight into the factors changing surface water carbon from 1990 to 2000 there were more sites with increasing svisa than sites with decreasing trends fig 1 but since 2000 svisa has decreased in around 10 30 of the sites with almost no sites showing increasing trends a shift in surface water om quality over time has been detected in earlier studies of uk catchments influenced by urban areas worrall and burt 2010 however those temporal patterns differed from the patterns found in the catchments of the present study where urban areas had very limited influence if any a decoupling of doc and color was also identified in lakes of northeastern us lapierre et al 2021 and norway hongve et al 2004 this could indicate different drivers for the colored fraction of om the om quality results also demonstrate that trends of brownification are not straightforward and depend on whether it is color or oc that is considered 3 3 potential drivers for om trends multiple drivers may have contributed to the rising toc concentrations prior to 2010 when such trends were more widespread hence it is challenging to distinguish the relative importance of causes for the toc trends or lack thereof observed during the past decade a systematic investigation of the available evidence to answer this such as the full range of chemical constituents besides toc as well as changes in catchment land use and biomass soils and climate patterns were outside the scope of this paper that aims to assess the duration and extent of brownification in sweden nonetheless the spatial and temporal patterns of toc concentrations across three decades can be used to speculate on the potential drivers the fact that brownification has been put on hold since 2010 in most areas of sweden could imply that acidification recovery has been one of the major factors driving the trends in toc after 1990 it could also be that certain climate factors such as seasonal variation in precipitation and temperature may be driving trends that are less monotonic in time and space than recovery from acid deposition clark et al 2010 increasing biomass and or land cover changes is a persistent factor that could drive brownification in the more limited areas where increases in toc continued after 2010 indeed many of the sites that have continued to brownify are located in the south of sweden where poor agricultural land was converted to coniferous forest a little over a century ago
