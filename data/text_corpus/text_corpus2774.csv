13870,environmental protection and the preservation of water quality from the point of view of life protection on earth and important raw materials in industry requires analysis and determining the presence of various potential pollutants that are released in a controlled or uncontrolled water resources the ibar river which drains kosovo to a large extent of the flow is exposed to the influence of heavy metals that appear as pollutants of this river and indicators of the effects of the production processes and the existing passive and active mines of the trepça combinations located in this area the aim of this paper is i determination of the concentration of ions pb2 cd2 and zn2 in the waste waters of the industrial complex that are released into the effluent ii defining an efficient solution for smoothing the concentration of heavy metals through the production of filters based on cheap and available materials the selected materials are based on perlon and wool the recycle is important for practical applications keywords waste water filters heavy metals psa 1 introduction water pollution is the presence of biological physical and chemical substances above the prescribed values 1 the creation of a significant amount of these materials is most often due to different industrial processes with different industrial and municipal landfills involved in the total contribution of pollution 2 3 in addition to physicochemical methods 4 5 for the protection and treatment of water a number of procedures 5 have been developed which primarily depends on the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of water the type and extent of the harmful effect of the pollutant the required degree of purification stability and reliability procedures as well as economic possibilities 6 one of these procedures is sorption which can be effective for the removal of all substances that have an affinity for physical adsorption and chemisorption using various materials as sorbents 7 8 sorbents are mainly used as part of the filtration agents for removal of cyanide 9 10 metal ions 11 28 paint 29 oil and petroleum 18 19 the sorption properties of fibrous materials depend on the porosity the specific surface and the content of the corresponding functional groups on the surface of the material the greatest influence on the sorption properties of fibrous materials has the following hydrophobicity and characteristic like a scrub structure of the surface the curliness of fibers and functional groups amino amido carboxylic and sulphonated in the seventies masri and associates examined the interaction of wool with different metal ions 30 good sorption on the wool have ions of silver with the sorption increasing with increasing ph while gold quickly and almost quantitatively sorbs on the wool 31 aluminum is bonded over the carboxyl groups to the wool so the esterification of the wool inhibits and the acetylation promotes aluminum sorption about 30 of aluminum is bonded to wool with van der waals forces 32 the copper is bonded to the wool as cu and cu2 and the nature of the copper binding in the ph range of 3 5 indicates that these ions primarily bind to carboxyl groups in transverse chains of the protein 33 the sorption properties of wool for pb and cu were examined by hemrajani and narwani 34 they concluded that the primary carboxyl and amino groups do not participate in ion exchange but that possible sites for the ion binding are the nh group of the histidine residue containing the imidazole group or the most likely places for bonding these metals are co nh2 and co nh groups this behavior is primarily associated with carboxylic groups of fibers the conversion of cystine which is present in large amounts in the wool to lantonin or s methyl cystine slightly affects on the adsorption of metal ions 35 recent research has shown that non woven wool materials have satisfactory sorption properties 18 19 mesoporous tio2 has gained increasing interest because of its outstanding properties and promising applications in a wide range of fields 36 mesoporous tio2 exhibits excellent solar energy utilization and degradation rate of pollutants 37 38 this work is about analysis testing conditions production and application of the filter of a material based on wool and perlon to reduce the content of heavy metals pb cd and zn the tests were carried out from the solution model for different filter masses amounts of the tested metals exposure time ph and temperature using potentiometric stripping analysis 20 39 2 material and methods 2 1 apparatus determination of pb cd and zn was performed using the apparatus striping analyzer m1 faculty of technology novi sad and symmetry leskovac serbia 40 42 the investigated metals were determined in the same analytical step at a constant electricity of 48 90 μa for 300 s and a yield potential of 1 40 v 21 39 2 2 chemicals for the experimental part of this paper the solutions were prepared from high purity chemicals suprapur manufactured by merck darmstadt germany the basic solutions were prepared from the standards of lead cadmium zinc and mercury 1 000 g dm 3 while the working solutions were prepared at a concentration of 50 mg dm 3 in addition to the standard solutions acid solutions were used chloride hcl 30 nitrate hno3 65 salt solutions potassium chloride kcl copper sulfate cuso4 gallium chloride gacl3 and acetone ch3coch3 99 5 the solutions were stored in polyethylene bottles 2 3 sampling and preparation of samples to perform this experiment models of solutions of different concentrations and sampling of wastewater of the trepca combine were prepared after filtering paper filter black strip n0 5891 the samples were prepared for analysis 20 22 filters were prepared from perlon and wool materials materials removed from use random samples and unknown producers were prepared by washing with 0 2 detergent solution meril merima kruševac at 30 after washing with hot and cold water the fibers were dried at room temperature and the filters were prepared by simple tackling to obtain the denser porous structure fig 1 shows preparation of filters made of pearl and wool material fig 2 shows the influence of concentrated solutions of acids and bases on materials from pearls and wool 3 results and discussion all measurements in this paper were carried out using simultaneous potentiometric stripping analysis from the solution model for metal contents up to 2000 0 μg with statistical data processing the content of pb2 ion of 25 0 500 0 μg was determined with a 2 3 error greater than 3 3 5 mistake and smaller than 4 6 5 the coefficient of variation for all values greater than 200 μg did not exceed 8 cd2 ion content of 50 0 1000 0 μg was determined with a 2 3 error greater than an error of more than 3 and smaller than a mistake greater than 4 the used method obtained the most accurate results for zn2 ion for contents of 25 0 1200 0 μg deviations were in the range of 2 the greater content was determined with a 2 5 error and a smaller 10 0 μg with an error up to 6 good repeatability for all contents is greater than 200 0 μg the coefficient of variation did not exceed the value of 8 which presents a good representation of the mean value test of q examination of the conditions for the preparation and application of filters based on pearl and wool materials was carried out for various filter masses exposure time temperature ph and contents of the tested metals the results of the determination of concentrations pb2 cd2 and zn2 in the solution after filtration through mass filters of 0 02 0 30 g at room temperature and the exposure time of filters of the 40 min are shown in fig 3 based on the results shown a filter of the perlon based material of mass 0 12 g for a 40 minute exposure retains 71 of pb2 and zn2 and 70 of cd2 a wool like filter of the same mass for the same period of time retains 83 of pb2 77 of cd2 and 75 of zn2 therefore as the mass of the filtration structure is higher the transiency is smaller so the effect of diffusion deposition is higher in addition the retention of metals on filters made of perlon and wool materials can be explained by the hydrodynamic effect of the metal solution around the fibers of the tested materials on which the particles are gradually deposited consequently this prevents slipping of particles under the influence of braun s motion and motion acting forces resulting in the collisions of the particles with the filament fibers and retention on them the process of further retention of particles could characterize the adhesion forces that is the retention of particles can be attributed to the action of molecular capillary and electrostatic impact the application of filters made of perlon and wool materials were experimentally tested for a different exposure time of the filter filters were immersed in solutions with an initial concentration of test metals of 500 0 μg measurement of the remaining metal content in the solutions was done after 10 20 30 40 and 50 min for a filter mass of 0 12 g it has been found that ions of metals are relatively quickly absorbed on the wool which is in accordance with the literature claims 30 the results of this measurement fig 4 show that the longer the exposure time of the filter the greater the amount of retained particles for a period of 50 min 72 of pb2 70 of cd2 and 71 of zn2 are retained on the filter made of perlon the wool filter for the same amount of time retains 83 of pb2 77 of cd2 and 76 of zn2 on the basis of the above results the precipitation of the incoming particles is more explicit on the already deposited particles compared to the clean surface of the filtering material which leads to an increase in the sediment over time until the joints of adjacent fibers are fused and filling the free space between the fibers it was noted that for a filter of the mass of 0 12 g for both of the materials examined a saturation point is created within 30 min that is the moment when the filter is not able to sorb the metals anymore the mass of the retained particles which does not affect the change in the resistance caused by the deposit of particles is expressed as the filtering capacity presented as the ratio of the difference in the metal content before initial content and after filtering and the mass of the filters the filtering capacity of the filters made of perlon and wool material was determined on the basis of the following equation q c i c f m where q is the filtering capacity μg g 1 ci content of the metal prior to filtration initial content μg cf content of the metal after filtering m mass of the filter g the filtration capacity perlon has the highest value for the filter mass of 0 12 g for 30 m in 30 102 μg g 1 for pb2 29 102 μg g 1 for cd2 and 30 102 μg g 1 for zn2 fig 5 based on the results shown it was noted that the difference in the filtering capacity of the perlon based filter for pb2 cd2 and zn2 is insignificant filtering capacity wool also has the highest value for 0 12 g weight filters the filtering capacity of the 0 12 g mass filter for a period of 30 min is 35 102 μg g 1 for pb2 32 102 μg g 1 for cd2 and 31 102 μg g 1 for zn2 based on the results shown it was noted that the filtering capacity of the wool based filter material is slightly higher for pb2 which can be partly explained by its atomic mass and gravitational force the evaluation of the technical performance of the filters was also made on the basis of a penetration coefficient the penetration coefficient of the filter represents the ratio of the content of abstained metals that pass through the filter and the total content of the metals that come to the filter p c f c o 100 where p is the coefficient of penetration of the filter c f content of metals passing through the filter μg c 0 content of the metal in front of the filter the content of the metal coming to the filter μg it has been experimentally established that the filtration always produces a penetration i e passage of certain metal content through the filter by passing through the filter the water flows through the fibers the currents continually change their direction they merged and re divided the shape of these currents is variable due to the random distribution of the channels streaming in channels between the fibers influences the increase of the hydrodynamic resistance pressure drop the hydrodynamic resistance of the filter to the flow of water is the force consumed to overcome the internal friction when water is moving through the channels between the fibers the increase in the hydrodynamic resistance depends on the retained particles in the filter bulkheads the dependence of penetrating coefficient of the filter of the filter mass is shown in fig 6 based on the graphic dependence fig 4 the coefficient of penetration of the filter is inversely proportional to the mass of the filter meaning if the mass of the filter is smaller the coefficient of the penetration of filter is higher the filter penetration coefficient was experimentally determined for the filter mass of 0 01 0 30 g and for the metal content in front of the filter of 500 μg the 0 12 g perlon based filter has a penetrating coefficient 29 for pb2 30 for cd2 and 29 for zn2 a filter of 0 12 g based on the wool material for the metal content in front of the filter of 500 μg has the following coefficient of penetration 17 for pb2 23 for cd2 and 25 for zn2 the obtained results show that the coefficient of penetration of the filter both from one and the other material is low which points to the fact that the degree of retention of metals on filters is high a coefficient of penetration of filters based on wool materials is significant especially in terms of pb2 content 17 tests related to filtering and reducing the content of pb2 cd2 and zn2 according to temperature are shown in fig 7 based on the results shown the filtering capacity of the filters on the base of perlon and wool materials observed for all three metals has the highest values at room temperature 22 2 as the temperature increases the filtering capacity decreases thus reducing the content of the metals retained on the filter due to the degradation of the structure and the shape of the fibers at higher temperatures at temperatures exceeding 40 the filtering capacity for both tested materials is less than 20 102 μg g 1 while at a temperature of 100 the filtration capacity value for both tested materials was about 10 102 μg g 1 indicating a significant reduction in filter capacity if wastewater is drawn through the drainage filters the influence of ph on filtering capacity for perlon and wool filters was tested for values from 1 6 7 0 adjusting the ph value was done by adding chloric acid the results of the filtering capacity dependence on ph are shown in fig 8 based on the results the largest filtering capacity is in the neutral environment the filter filtration capacity of the perlon based material ph 7 for all three metals is in the range 29 30 102 μg g 1 in slightly acidic environment it is slightly reduced and for ph 4 it has values 28 102 μg g 1 for pb2 28 102 μg g 1 for cd2 and zn2 for ph 2 the filtering capacity has values ranging from 23 to 24 102 μg g 1 the filtration capacity of a filter made of the perlon based material of less than 20 102 μg g 1 are present in ph 2 the filtration capacity of the wool based filter ph 7 is for all three metals in the interval of 31 35 102 μg g 1 in a slightly acidic environment the filtering capacity values are slightly reduced and for ph 4 it has values 33 102 μg g 1 for pb2 30 102 μg g 1 for cd2 and zn2 with a decrease in ph acidity the filtration capacity for ph 2 is in the interval of 24 27 102 μg g 1 values for filtering capacity for filters of wool based materials of less than 20 102 μg g 1 are in the ph values of 2 therefore the filtration capacity of the filters of perlon and wool in strongly acidic environments is low it has been experimentally confirmed that in concentrated solutions of aggressive substances acid there is a decomposition of the structure of the material from the perlon the base decomposition of the structure of the wool material supplementary based on the above the use of filters based on perlon and wool is under a significant ph effect which is in accordance with previous studies that connect influence of the ph with the active groups nh co nh2 and co nh especially for wool based materials 32 33 the filtration capacity and coefficient of penetration of filters from perlon and wool were also followed for different heavy metal content the results of these measurements are shown in fig 9 the analyses were made for metal content of 50 0 1000 0 μg in neutral conditions at room temperature and filter mass of 0 12 g the higher the content of the metal in the filtered medium the greater the coefficient of filtration regardless of whether it is a filter made of perlon or wool it means that the filter coefficient is greater when the metal content is higher on the other hand when the content of the metal is higher the coefficient of filter penetration is smaller which is in accordance with the fact that the separation of the incoming particles is visible more on the already precipitated particles compared to the clean surface of the filtering material filters based on perlon and wool materials were used in wastewater of the trepca combine the results of applying these filters in real conditions are shown in table 1 heavy metal ions such as pb2 cd2 and zn2 are toxic polutants that are not susceptible to biodegradation once discharged into the environment in it they remain in the tendency of accumulation and entering the food chain for this reason developed countries have developed strict legislation on the quality of waste effluents before their discharge into the environment the aim of this regulation in addition to preventing further emissions of pollutants into the environment is that they are kept within the limits of the allowed concentration in natural waters the allowed concentrations of heavy metal ions in the waters in serbia are precisely defined by the law on environmental protection 43 the water act 44 as well as other laws that apply to them build maximum permitted with concentration mac of heavy metals in natural waters in the republic of serbia are prescribed by the regulation on limit values for emissions of pollutants 45 regulation on limit values of priority and hazardous substances 45 limit values define the maximum allowed quantities of pollutants that can be released from polluting sources in the aquatic environment without harming the ecological balance the water framework directive 46 dominates eu regulations in the water sector especially on industrial emissions and environmental impact assessments the water sector in serbia suffers major pollution due to the unloading of untreated industrial and municipal wastewater into the water streams which is why a solution has been sought in the application of the filters the results shown indicate a significant decrease in concentration pb2 cd2 and zn2 in wastewater after the application of the filter using filters based on pearl concentration material pb2 and zn2 is reduced by 71 and cd2 fir 70 filters based on wool material retain 82 of concentration pb2 77 of concentration cd2 and 75 of concentration zn2 a somewhat higher reduction in metal concentration occurs when applying filters based on wool materials concentration pb2 in wastewater from 763 9 μg dm 3 after filtering through a single layer filter is 1322 μg dm 3 it is through two layer 88 1 μg dm 3 and through three layers 58 7 μg dm 3 expressed in percentage amounts 93 3 for pb2 90 for cd2 and 89 for zn2 by using combination filters made of wool and pearl material the concentration of metal in wastewater is reduced by more than 80 purified water according to the legal regulations of the republic of serbia and the water framework directive which dominates eu regulations in the water sector in terms of concentrations pb2 cd2 and zn2 can be discharged into public sewerage the advantage of filters made of perlon in relation to wool based filters is that they have a higher resistance to moisture elevated temperature are not attacked by microorganisms whereas the filtering process is largely influenced by the mass of the filter and filtering time the use of filters based on perlon depends on the geometric effect thickness and layout of fibers therefore the production of filters based on perlon and wool material is a good choice especially for wastewater industrial when more filtration layers of these materials are mixed then there is a real possibility of replacing used segments with fresh ones in the layer 4 conclusion studies have shown that a filter of perlon of 0 12 g weight holds about 70 of heavy metals during a 40 minute exposure a wool filter of the same mass for the same period of time retains 83 of pb2 77 of cd2 and 75 of zn2 if the mass of the filtration structure is larger the transiency is smaller so the effect of the diffusion deposition is higher with the increase in the mass of the separated particles the filtration capacity decreases with saturation a filter made of perlon weighing 0 12 g for a 50 min exposure retains 72 of pb2 70 of cd2 and 71 of zn2 the wool based filter for the same period of time retains 83 of pb2 77 of cd2 and 76 of zn2 the precipitation of the incoming particles is more pronounced on already precipitated particles in relation to the clean surface of the filtering material which leads to an increase of the precipitate over time to the binding of the residue of adjacent fibers and filling out of the free space between fibers to the saturation point after which desorption occurs the filtration capacity of the filters from perlon has the highest value for a filter mass of 0 12 g and for a period of 30 min amounts 30 102 μg g 1 for all three metals the filtering capacity of the wool based filter has the highest value for a filter mass of 0 12 g and for a period of 30 min it is 35 102 μg g 1 for pb2 32 102 μg g 1 for cd2 and 31 102 μg g 1 for zn2 the coefficient of penetration of a filter based on perlon of 0 12 g is 29 for pb2 30 for cd2 and 29 for zn2 the coefficient of penetration of the filter based on the wool material of 12 g is 17 for pb2 23 for cd2 and 25 for zn2 filtering capacity of filters based on perlon and wool materials has the highest values for all three metals at a temperature of 22 2 as the temperature increases the filtering capacity decreases and the purification degree decreases due to degradation of the structure and form of the fibers of the filtering material based on the filtering capacity the optimum ph for filtering is 7 the filtering capacity of the perlon based filter for all three metals ranges from 29 to 30 102 μg g 1 the filtration capacity of wool based filters for all three metals is from 31 to 34 5 102 μg g 1 with increasing acidity the filtering capacity of the filters from the perlon and wool materials decreases applying filters lead to decreased concentration pb2 cd2 and zn2 ions in wastewater filters based on pearlon materials reduce concentration of pb2 and zn2 to 71 and cd2 to 70 filters based on wool material retain 82 of concentration pb2 77 of concentration cd2 and 75 of concentration zn2 a more significant reduction in metal concentration is due to the use of wool based filters concentration of pb2 in wastewater from 763 9 μg dm 3 after filtering through a single layer filter is 1322 μg dm 3 through two layer 88 1 μg dm 3 and through three layers 58 7 μg dm 3 expressed in percentage amounts 93 3 for pb2 90 for cd2 and 89 for zn2 by using combination filters made of wool and pearl based materials the concentration of metal in wastewater is reduced by more than 80 purified water according to the law on water of the republic of serbia and water framework directive dominating european union regulations in terms of concentrations pb2 cd2 and zn2 can be discharged into public sewerage declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper

due to the random distribution of the channels streaming in channels between the fibers influences the increase of the hydrodynamic resistance pressure drop the hydrodynamic resistance of the filter to the flow of water is the force consumed to overcome the internal friction when water is moving through the channels between the fibers the increase in the hydrodynamic resistance depends on the retained particles in the filter bulkheads the dependence of penetrating coefficient of the filter of the filter mass is shown in fig 6 based on the graphic dependence fig 4 the coefficient of penetration of the filter is inversely proportional to the mass of the filter meaning if the mass of the filter is smaller the coefficient of the penetration of filter is higher the filter penetration coefficient was experimentally determined for the filter mass of 0 01 0 30 g and for the metal content in front of the filter of 500 μg the 0 12 g perlon based filter has a penetrating coefficient 29 for pb2 30 for cd2 and 29 for zn2 a filter of 0 12 g based on the wool material for the metal content in front of the filter of 500 μg has the following coefficient of penetration 17 for pb2 23 for cd2 and 25 for zn2 the obtained results show that the coefficient of penetration of the filter both from one and the other material is low which points to the fact that the degree of retention of metals on filters is high a coefficient of penetration of filters based on wool materials is significant especially in terms of pb2 content 17 tests related to filtering and reducing the content of pb2 cd2 and zn2 according to temperature are shown in fig 7 based on the results shown the filtering capacity of the filters on the base of perlon and wool materials observed for all three metals has the highest values at room temperature 22 2 as the temperature increases the filtering capacity decreases thus reducing the content of the metals retained on the filter due to the degradation of the structure and the shape of the fibers at higher temperatures at temperatures exceeding 40 the filtering capacity for both tested materials is less than 20 102 μg g 1 while at a temperature of 100 the filtration capacity value for both tested materials was about 10 102 μg g 1 indicating a significant reduction in filter capacity if wastewater is drawn through the drainage filters the influence of ph on filtering capacity for perlon and wool filters was tested for values from 1 6 7 0 adjusting the ph value was done by adding chloric acid the results of the filtering capacity dependence on ph are shown in fig 8 based on the results the largest filtering capacity is in the neutral environment the filter filtration capacity of the perlon based material ph 7 for all three metals is in the range 29 30 102 μg g 1 in slightly acidic environment it is slightly reduced and for ph 4 it has values 28 102 μg g 1 for pb2 28 102 μg g 1 for cd2 and zn2 for ph 2 the filtering capacity has values ranging from 23 to 24 102 μg g 1 the filtration capacity of a filter made of the perlon based material of less than 20 102 μg g 1 are present in ph 2 the filtration capacity of the wool based filter ph 7 is for all three metals in the interval of 31 35 102 μg g 1 in a slightly acidic environment the filtering capacity values are slightly reduced and for ph 4 it has values 33 102 μg g 1 for pb2 30 102 μg g 1 for cd2 and zn2 with a decrease in ph acidity the filtration capacity for ph 2 is in the interval of 24 27 102 μg g 1 values for filtering capacity for filters of wool based materials of less than 20 102 μg g 1 are in the ph values of 2 therefore the filtration capacity of the filters of perlon and wool in strongly acidic environments is low it has been experimentally confirmed that in concentrated solutions of aggressive substances acid there is a decomposition of the structure of the material from the perlon the base decomposition of the structure of the wool material supplementary based on the above the use of filters based on perlon and wool is under a significant ph effect which is in accordance with previous studies that connect influence of the ph with the active groups nh co nh2 and co nh especially for wool based materials 32 33 the filtration capacity and coefficient of penetration of filters from perlon and wool were also followed for different heavy metal content the results of these measurements are shown in fig 9 the analyses were made for metal content of 50 0 1000 0 μg in neutral conditions at room temperature and filter mass of 0 12 g the higher the content of the metal in the filtered medium the greater the coefficient of filtration regardless of whether it is a filter made of perlon or wool it means that the filter coefficient is greater when the metal content is higher on the other hand when the content of the metal is higher the coefficient of filter penetration is smaller which is in accordance with the fact that the separation of the incoming particles is visible more on the already precipitated particles compared to the clean surface of the filtering material filters based on perlon and wool materials were used in wastewater of the trepca combine the results of applying these filters in real conditions are shown in table 1 heavy metal ions such as pb2 cd2 and zn2 are toxic polutants that are not susceptible to biodegradation once discharged into the environment in it they remain in the tendency of accumulation and entering the food chain for this reason developed countries have developed strict legislation on the quality of waste effluents before their discharge into the environment the aim of this regulation in addition to preventing further emissions of pollutants into the environment is that they are kept within the limits of the allowed concentration in natural waters the allowed concentrations of heavy metal ions in the waters in serbia are precisely defined by the law on environmental protection 43 the water act 44 as well as other laws that apply to them build maximum permitted with concentration mac of heavy metals in natural waters in the republic of serbia are prescribed by the regulation on limit values for emissions of pollutants 45 regulation on limit values of priority and hazardous substances 45 limit values define the maximum allowed quantities of pollutants that can be released from polluting sources in the aquatic environment without harming the ecological balance the water framework directive 46 dominates eu regulations in the water sector especially on industrial emissions and environmental impact assessments the water sector in serbia suffers major pollution due to the unloading of untreated industrial and municipal wastewater into the water streams which is why a solution has been sought in the application of the filters the results shown indicate a significant decrease in concentration pb2 cd2 and zn2 in wastewater after the application of the filter using filters based on pearl concentration material pb2 and zn2 is reduced by 71 and cd2 fir 70 filters based on wool material retain 82 of concentration pb2 77 of concentration cd2 and 75 of concentration zn2 a somewhat higher reduction in metal concentration occurs when applying filters based on wool materials concentration pb2 in wastewater from 763 9 μg dm 3 after filtering through a single layer filter is 1322 μg dm 3 it is through two layer 88 1 μg dm 3 and through three layers 58 7 μg dm 3 expressed in percentage amounts 93 3 for pb2 90 for cd2 and 89 for zn2 by using combination filters made of wool and pearl material the concentration of metal in wastewater is reduced by more than 80 purified water according to the legal regulations of the republic of serbia and the water framework directive which dominates eu regulations in the water sector in terms of concentrations pb2 cd2 and zn2 can be discharged into public sewerage the advantage of filters made of perlon in relation to wool based filters is that they have a higher resistance to moisture elevated temperature are not attacked by microorganisms whereas the filtering process is largely influenced by the mass of the filter and filtering time the use of filters based on perlon depends on the geometric effect thickness and layout of fibers therefore the production of filters based on perlon and wool material is a good choice especially for wastewater industrial when more filtration layers of these materials are mixed then there is a real possibility of replacing used segments with fresh ones in the layer 4 conclusion studies have shown that a filter of perlon of 0 12 g weight holds about 70 of heavy metals during a 40 minute exposure a wool filter of the same mass for the same period of time retains 83 of pb2 77 of cd2 and 75 of zn2 if the mass of the filtration structure is larger the transiency is smaller so the effect of the diffusion deposition is higher with the increase in the mass of the separated particles the filtration capacity decreases with saturation a filter made of perlon weighing 0 12 g for a 50 min exposure retains 72 of pb2 70 of cd2 and 71 of zn2 the wool based filter for the same period of time retains 83 of pb2 77 of cd2 and 76 of zn2 the precipitation of the incoming particles is more pronounced on already precipitated particles in relation to the clean surface of the filtering material which leads to an increase of the precipitate over time to the binding of the residue of adjacent fibers and filling out of the free space between fibers to the saturation point after which desorption occurs the filtration capacity of the filters from perlon has the highest value for a filter mass of 0 12 g and for a period of 30 min amounts 30 102 μg g 1 for all three metals the filtering capacity of the wool based filter has the highest value for a filter mass of 0 12 g and for a period of 30 min it is 35 102 μg g 1 for pb2 32 102 μg g 1 for cd2 and 31 102 μg g 1 for zn2 the coefficient of penetration of a filter based on perlon of 0 12 g is 29 for pb2 30 for cd2 and 29 for zn2 the coefficient of penetration of the filter based on the wool material of 12 g is 17 for pb2 23 for cd2 and 25 for zn2 filtering capacity of filters based on perlon and wool materials has the highest values for all three metals at a temperature of 22 2 as the temperature increases the filtering capacity decreases and the purification degree decreases due to degradation of the structure and form of the fibers of the filtering material based on the filtering capacity the optimum ph for filtering is 7 the filtering capacity of the perlon based filter for all three metals ranges from 29 to 30 102 μg g 1 the filtration capacity of wool based filters for all three metals is from 31 to 34 5 102 μg g 1 with increasing acidity the filtering capacity of the filters from the perlon and wool materials decreases applying filters lead to decreased concentration pb2 cd2 and zn2 ions in wastewater filters based on pearlon materials reduce concentration of pb2 and zn2 to 71 and cd2 to 70 filters based on wool material retain 82 of concentration pb2 77 of concentration cd2 and 75 of concentration zn2 a more significant reduction in metal concentration is due to the use of wool based filters concentration of pb2 in wastewater from 763 9 μg dm 3 after filtering through a single layer filter is 1322 μg dm 3 through two layer 88 1 μg dm 3 and through three layers 58 7 μg dm 3 expressed in percentage amounts 93 3 for pb2 90 for cd2 and 89 for zn2 by using combination filters made of wool and pearl based materials the concentration of metal in wastewater is reduced by more than 80 purified water according to the law on water of the republic of serbia and water framework directive dominating european union regulations in terms of concentrations pb2 cd2 and zn2 can be discharged into public sewerage declaration of interests the authors

13871,saigon river is the primary water supply source for ho chi minh city vietnam currently the formation of harmful disinfectant by products dbps in the piped water is elevating due to the increase in both organic matter pollution in saigon river and chloride usage at water treatment plants wtps to provide safe drinking water the wtps should upgrade their existing conventional surface water treatment technology to reduce dbp precursors and chlorine consuming substances efficiently in this study the long term performance of a pilot system including a biofiltration ozonation unit and a biological activated carbon bac filter in removing these compounds was evaluated different from other studies a tricking filter tf was placed before a low dose ozone contactor for water pretreatment by partially returning the ozonated water to the tf the removal of dissolved organic carbon doc which contains dbp precursors in the tf ozonation unit was doubled over two months operated with highly fluctuated river water quality in the rainy season the pilot systems stably removed 50 of doc 71 of trihalomethane formation potential thmfp 71 of fe2 and 74 of n nh4 the tf ozonation unit was effective in removing doc thmfp and nh4 while the bac filter was more effective in removing fe2 if implemented this system can replace the pre chlorination process accounting for 74 of daily chlorine consumption at tan hiep wtp the obtained results indicate that retrofitting wtps with the tested processes can provide safe drinking water for ho chi minh city residents in the future keywords disinfection by products dbps trihalomethane formation potential thmfp ozonation biofiltration dissolved organic carbon doc chlorine consuming substances 1 introduction saigon river is the raw surface water source for water supply systems of ho chi minh city the most significant economic hub of vietnam currently river water quality has been declined due to urbanization agriculture and aquaculture activities 1 particularly the concentrations of pollutants such as nutrients pathogen and organic compounds have gradually increased 1 tan hiep water treatment plant thwtp is currently supplying 300 000 m3 day to the city s residents using the water taken from saigon river to ensure that the supplied water meet the drinking water quality standards qcvn 01 2009 byt national technical regulation on drinking water 2 thwtp has to employ a large amount of chlorine in a pretreatment process to remove iron color odor algae and other organisms afterward the water was treated by conventional processes such as coagulation flocculation sedimentation granular media filtration and chlorine disinfection 3 a flow process outline of this water treatment plant is illustrated in supplementary material sm figure s1 the use of high amount of chlorine for both pre chlorination and disinfection 3 3 6 5 mg l in the presence of elevated amount of organic matter in saigon river raw water i e 3 1 0 25 mg l dissolved organic carbon doc resulted in the formation of the harmful disinfection by products dbps such as trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids 3 dbps are known for possibly causing severe problems in the liver kidney central nervous systems and increased risk of cancer 4 it was reported that the amount of thms formed after disinfection in thwtp was 155 8 μg l 3 although this thm concentration currently meets the drinking water quality standards in vietnam it is higher than the total thm level allowed by the u s environmental protection agency epa 0 08 mg l 4 due to the increase in pollution in saigon river water the thms produced from thwtp would be inevitably higher than the reported value in the future therefore thwtp needs to find practical strategies to minimize the formation of dbps and reduction of chlorine demand such as lowering the amount of reducing agents that easily react with chlorine e g doc ferrous and ammonia membrane and adsorption processes can be used the remove dbps once they are formed in the water 5 6 a more proactive approach is controlling the formation of these chemicals by i using different disinfectants or removing their precursors such as natural organic matter nom 7 the presence of nom in water could be reduced effectively by various methods including enhanced coagulation 8 9 and coagulation based integrated processes such as coagulation membrane filtration coagulation adsorption oxidation coagulation and coagulation ion exchange 9 however the use of coagulation for nom removal usually results in a higher demand for chemicals and more production of sludge 9 other methods for removing nom involve the combinational use of ozone at low concentration smaller than 4 mg l and biotreatment 10 in this case a fraction of recalcitrant organic matter became biodegradable through ozonation and therefore could be removed by the following biological processes 10 bond et al summarized that the removal of thm precursors by ozone biofiltration processes was highly fluctuated from 5 to 55 7 through a pilot study with water taken from huangpu river in shanghai china that had a doc concentration of 6 7 mg l the combination of conventional processes i e coagulation flocculation sedimentation and granular filtration removed only 26 of doc 11 however when this water was further treated with o3 biological activated carbon bac the percentage of doc removal reached to 50 11 the coupling of o3 uv and bac for treating saigon river water was investigated over six months also at pilot scale in our previous study 12 such integration resulted in only 18 removal of doc and 39 of trihalomethane formation potential thmfp among various biological processes trickling filtration tf is known for efficiently removing biodegradable doc bdoc by heterotrophic bacteria and converting ammonia to nitrate by autotrophic nitrifying bacteria 13 therefore this process could be a promising candidate for removing high levels of doc and chlorine consuming substances e g ammonia in saigon river water based on the presented information it was hypothesized that the use of tf followed by ozonation and returning the ozonated water to the tf for further removal of bdoc could be a potential approach to minimize thmfp this specific configuration could have several advantages over the usual ozonation biofiltration setup for instance fractions of recalcitrant nom can undergo more ozone oxidation iterations possibly resulting in a higher amount of nom removal besides as biodegradable nom and ammonia are already consumed in the tf ozone likely reacts only with recalcitrant nom thus the amount of the supplied ozone would be reduced since fe2 and n nh4 could be converted to fe3 and no3 in both biological and ozonation processes the combination of the tf and ozonation was also expected to lower the consumption of chlorine for pre chlorination however the actual performance of such treatment configuration has not been investigated therefore this study aims to evaluate the efficiency of a pilot system which contained a tf ozonation unit followed by bac filtration for long term removal of dbp precursors and chlorine consuming substances from saigon river water it has been reported that thms are easier to be detected than other dbps and there is a good correlation between trichloromethane a thm and other dbp concentrations 14 compared with haa formation potential haafp thmfp was more challenging to be removed by only oxidation 15 and ozone uv bac processes 12 therefore thm was the only dbp of interest in this study the experiments were properly designed and the amount of obtained data was adequate for meaningful statistical analyses based on the obtained experimental results a practical recommendation for retrofitting the current thwtp to comply with stricter future water quality standards on dbps will be proposed if this plan is successfully implemented the saigon river would still be the main supply of safe drinking water for ho chi minh city residents 2 materials and methods 2 1 raw surface water the raw water was collected directly from saigon river at hoa phu pumping station of thwtp the duration of the experiment was ten months from october 2015 to august 2016 the properties of this raw water are shown in table 1 the dissolved organic matter dom fractionation and isolation of the water samples was out of the study scope and therefore not performed the river water was then transferred to a 1 m3 stainless steel tank using a centrifugal pump cma 0 5 m ebara italy the water ph was adjusted to 6 5 7 5 by a ph controller pc 310 suntex instruments taiwan and a dosing pump pulsafeeder usa using 3 naoh solution at the storage tank before entering subsequent biological treatment processes 2 2 configuration of the pilot system the simplified flow schematic diagram of the pilot system is illustrated in fig 1 for enhancing nitrification and ferrous oxidation ph value of the raw water was adjusted to the range of 7 0 7 5 after contacting the biofilm in the tricking filter the water was passed through a venturi tube where ozone gas was injected into the water stream under negative pressure next the water ozone mixture was transferred to the ozone contactor the supplied ozone was generated from an ozonator at a feed rate of 20 g o3 h obm vietnam depending on the operation mode which is presented in section 2 3 a fraction of effluent from the ozone contactor was returned to the tf for further treatment of bdoc formed from the breaking down of nom by ozonation the ozonated water was then pumped to a rapid mixing box placed at the top of a fluidized bed clarifier it was then dosed with 3 poly aluminum chloride pac and 3 naoh solution finally the supernatant from the clarifier was pumped to a bac column for further removal of dpb precursors and chlorine consuming substances a detailed description of the pilot system can be found in the sm 2 3 operation of the tf ozone contactor unit to find the effects of returning ozonated water to the tf the tf ozone contactor unit was operated in two modes which were single pass and return modes in the single pass mode the tf was initially set to receive 1 0 m3 h of ph adjusted raw water however actual measurement at the field showed that the feed flow rate in this mode was only 0 75 m3 h which was equivalent to a hydraulic loading rate hlr of 3 m3 m2 h for the tf and a hydraulic retention time hrt of 25 min for the ozone contactor the single pass mode was operated over 69 days in the return mode the tf received a mixed flow 2 0 m3 h of ph adjusted raw water 1 0 m3 h and ozonated water 1 0 m3 h corresponding to a total hlr of 8 m3 m2 h then the whole stream from the tf was pumped to the ozone contactor in this case the hrt of the ozone contactor was 15 min the effluent from the ozone contactor was split into two flows one flow was returned to the tf 1 0 m3 h and the other 1 0 m3 h was fed to the rapid mixing box of the clarifier for turbidity removal compared to the single mode the tf and ozone contactor were operated at higher hlr and shorter hrts in the return mode i e 8 m3 m2 h vs 3 m3 m2 h of hlr in the tf and 15 vs 25 min of hrt in the ozone contactor the return mode was studied over 230 days right after the single pass mode run was finished operating conditions of the tf and its influent water quality at two modes are presented in sm table s4 the total amount of o3 supplied in both single pass and return modes was 3 1 mg l 2 4 operation of the bac column the effluent from the clarifier was fed to the bac column at a flow rate of 0 35 m3 h corresponding to an empty bed contact time ebct of 25 min and a filtration velocity of 3 5 m h the characteristic of the feed water is presented in table s4 in the sm the bac column was operated for 70 days during which the tf ozone was in the return mode the timeline of each type of experiment is presented in the sm figure s4 2 5 enrichment of the biological filters both the tf and bac column were enriched with 2 l of seeding sludge containing nitrifying bacteria during two weeks of starting up the seed sludge was taken from a sequential batch reactor containing mass liquor suspended solids and mass liquor volatile suspended solids concentrations of 1700 mg l and 1200 mg l respectively during the enrichment the ph of feed water was maintained at 7 0 7 4 the tf and bac were run at a flow rate of 0 75 m3 h and 0 35 m3 h respectively 2 6 chemicals and analytical methods analytical graded chemicals merck kgaa darmstadt germany were used for determining water quality parameters technical graded chemicals were used for adjusting ph and facilitating sedimentation water quality parameters such as ph turbidity color fe2 n nh4 alkalinity doc total solids ts total volatile solids tvs and thmfp were measured using standardized methods 16 bdoc was obtained from the decrease in doc concentration due to bacterial activities when the water sample was inoculated for 7 10 days in the dark with saturated gac 12 17 this material was taken from a household scale bac column operated for more than one year 12 17 detailed procedures for thmfp doc and bdoc measurements can be found from our previous studies 3 12 the amount of reacting ozone was estimated based on the amount of ozone from the generator output residual dissolved ozone and non dissolved ozone i e free ozone gas the amount of generated ozone and free ozone gas was measured using ki traps and titration with na2s2o3 16 method 2350e meanwhile the dissolved ozone remaining in the water after oxidation was measured via the indigo colorimetric method 16 method 4500 the amount of reacting ozone was obtained by subtracting the amount of free ozone gas and residual dissolved ozone from the total generated ozone maximum activities of ammonium oxidation bacteria aob and nitrite oxidation bacteria nob determined through batch tests 18 were used to assess the nitrogen conversion of the tf biomass summary of analytical methods and instrument employed in this study are listed in sm table s5 2 7 data processing and visualization all the data presented in this study were mean values standard errors paired two tailed t tests were employed to compare the results before and after treatment for comparing the treatment efficiencies of different operating modes f tests were firstly conducted to check the variance of the data sets then two tailed t tests were performed with either equal or unequal variance assumption depending on the preceding f test results 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal of dpb precursors in tf ozone contactor unit operated in single pass mode the concentrations of doc bdoc thmfp fe2 and n nh4 in the raw water tf influent tf effluent ozone contactor influent and ozone contactor effluent during the entire experimental duration was detailly presented in sm figure s5 in single pass mode there was no returning flow from the ozone contactor back to the tf hlr of the tf and the hrt of the ozone contactor were 3 m3 m2 h and 25 min respectively the removal of doc and bdoc in this setup calculated from the sm figure s5 data is presented in fig 2 initially the feed raw water contained 3 17 0 06 mg l doc and 0 54 0 04 mg l bdoc bdoc doc 0 17 after tf treatment these values decreased to 3 02 0 07 mg l doc and 0 37 0 06 mg l bdoc in this case although the tf was able to remove 30 bdoc its overall doc removal was negligible after sequentially passing out the ozone contactor the effluent contained a doc concentration of 2 89 0 09 mg l such small decrease in doc concentration from 3 02 to 2 89 mg l indicated that the employed ozonation was not effective in mineralizing nom at ozone concentration used in this study 3 1 mg l however it was observed that the amount of bdoc drastically increased after ozonation from 0 37 0 06 to 0 9 0 11 mg l bdoc resulting in 80 increase in the bdoc doc ratio i e 0 12 after tf vs 0 31 after ozonation similar increase in bdoc doc ratio was also observed in the coupling of ozonation and uv for treating the fluidized clarifier effluent of tan hiep wtp i e bdoc doc ratio increased from 0 12 to 0 28 12 therefore it could be concluded that while the tf ozone contactor unit operated in the single pass mode had low doc removal efficiency 9 it was highly effective in converting recalcitrant doc to bdoc this result is expected since ozonation can convert non biodegradable macromolecular compounds to biodegradable ones through the breakdown of large molecules 19 for instance li et al showed that the concentration of molecules having the molecular weight of 1000 3000 da increased by 9 after ozonation 19 thmfp was removed predominantly in the ozone contactor as 895 11 μg l of thmfp in the feed water was reduced to only 806 2 μg l in the tf and eventually to 489 25 μg l in the ozone contactor it was likely that the microorganisms in the tf did not consume the hydrophobic acid fraction of the doc which are was the most reactive thm precursor 20 in the feed water as the biological process was capable of removing hydrophilic and hydrophobic base neutral fractions 21 such speculation could also lead to a conclusion that these fractions were not the major components of the dom in the raw water the observed low doc removal 4 and high thmfp reduction 45 in the ozone contactor unit was in agreement with galapate et al 22 and was likely caused by the alteration of dom properties after ozonation 22 specifically it was reported that ozone could i convert the more reactive hydrophobic dom to the less reactive hydrophilic dom ii reduce the reactivity of these both types of dom and iii reduce the reactivity of reactive sites of the dom molecules 22 3 2 removal of dpb precursors in tf ozone contactor unit operated in return mode in the return mode 50 of the effluent flow from the ozone contactor i e 1 m3 h was returned and mixed with 1 m3 h of raw water to tf therefore the tf ozone contactor unit was run at a total flow rate of 2 m3 h equivalent to a hlr of 8 m3 m2 h for the tf and a hrt of 15 min for the ozone contactor the organic content concentrations in the raw water the influent and the effluent of both tf and ozone contactor are presented in fig 3 the doc and bdoc in the influent of the tf were 3 96 0 30 and 1 17 0 27 mg l respectively fig 3 the bdoc doc ratio in this water was 0 24 which was higher than that of the raw water bdoc doc 0 17 because the return water from the ozone contactor had a high concentration of bdoc this matter will be discussed later in this section in the return mode the tf removed more than 40 of bdoc resulting in an effluent bdoc concentration of 0 69 0 17 mg l in comparison with the single pass mode the bdoc mass loading rate and bdoc removal rate in the return mode were 5 8 and 7 0 times higher 187 g m2 d vs 32 g m2 d and 77 g m2 d vs 10 g m2 d respectively such result indicated that the return mode had created a favorable condition for heterotrophic bacterial activities in the tf filter possibly due to the more abundant of bdoc substrate and dissolved oxygen do as ozonated water was saturated with dissolved oxygen i e 7 3 mg l at 34 c in the tf 14 doc removal was observed as the doc in the tf effluent reduced from 3 96 0 30 3 67 0 22 mg l from ozone concentration measurements in the water and the gas phases it was estimated that 92 of the supplied ozone underwent reaction in the ozone contactor responding to a low ozone dosage of 0 84 go3 gdoc through ozonation the bdoc value increased dramatically from 0 69 0 17 mg l to 1 37 0 23 mg l while the doc slightly decreased from 3 67 0 22 mg l to 3 40 0 22 mg l this observation further confirmed that the main effect of low dose ozonation was converting recalcitrant doc to bdoc not removing doc 7 23 compared to the single pass mode the shorter hrt of the ozone contactor in the return mode 15 min vs 25 min likely did not affect the conversion of recalcitrant doc to bdoc as the calculated conversion percentages in both modes were similar 18 this observation is in agreement with a previous study in which the conversion of doc to bdoc stagnated although the reaction time was increased 11 particularly 32 5 g d of recalcitrant doc was estimated to become bdoc from a total doc mass loading rate of 176 gdoc d in the return mode in the single pass mode 9 6 g d of recalcitrant doc converted to bdoc from an overall doc mass loading rate of 54 3 gdoc d fig 4 a shows the changes of bdoc doc ratio of the raw water together with effluents of tf and ozone contactor in both single pass and return modes this figure demonstrates that the return mode resulted in a higher bdoc doc ratio than the single pass mode in the ozone contactor outlet 0 40 vs 0 31 with a p value of 0 10 therefore the performance of biological processes occurring in the tf film such as biodegradable organic removal by aerobic heterotrophic bacteria and denitrification by anoxic denitrifying bacteria was higher in the return mode as expected i e 40 bdoc removal in the return mode vs 30 in the single pass mode experimental results also revealed that the thmfp removal process occurred in both tf and ozonation not just in ozonation as in the single pass mode in the return mode an initial thmfp concentration of 1041 15 μg l at the tf inlet was stepwise reduced to 887 14 μg l at the tf outlet and then to 674 14 μg l at the ozone contactor outlet through ozonation the non biodegradable hydrophobic acid fraction in the raw water which is the most reactive thm precursors 20 might have been transformed into the biodegradable hydrophilic and hydrophobic base neutral fractions 11 as mentioned earlier therefore the partial returning of ozonated water to the tf was expected to promote thmfp reduction via microorganism activities this observed thmfp reduction is consistent with the earlier hypothesis that hydrophobic acid was the major fraction of dom in the tested raw water within the boundary of the tf ozone contactor unit presented in fig 1 the influent and effluent streams of the entire tf ozone contactor unit were similar in both modes i e 0 75 and 1 0 m3 h for single pass mode and return mode respectively as a result the overall doc removal of the tf ozonation contactor unit in these two modes could be reasonably compared a comparable removal efficiency in both modes suggest a better performance in the return mode as well fig 4b showed that tf ozone contactor unit operated in the return mode removed 17 9 of doc while only 8 6 of doc was removed in the single pass mode it is indeed concluded that the return of ozonated water to the tf greatly enhanced the doc removal performance of the entire tf ozone contactor unit as illustrated in fig 4b thmfp reduction was 45 in both single pass and return modes although the doc removal percentage was much lower i e 8 6 17 9 the o3 dosage used here 3 1 g m3 at 34 c or 0 84 go3 gdoc was possibly just enough to increase the bdoc doc ratio not to mineralize organic matter directly despite the similar thmfp removal efficiencies in both modes more thmfp was eliminated in the return mode as the thmfp in the feed water in this case was higher than that in the single pass mode 1220 13 μg l vs 895 11 μg l due to seasonal changes it should be also noted that the influent flow rate of the system was also slightly higher in the return mode 3 3 removal of chlorine consuming substances in tf ozone contactor unit the thwtp currently employs a pre chlorination process for iron color and algae removal prior to turbidity treatment using coagulation flocculation sedimentation and rapid sand filtration however this process could result in a high potential formation of thms due to the presence of elevated chlorine and dbp precursor concentrations therefore the removal of chlorine consumption substances such as fe2 and nh4 in the tf ozone contactor unit were also of importance in this study detailed information on the removal of fe2 and n nh4 in the tf ozone contactor unit operated in both single pass and return modes can be found from fig 4b this figure clearly showed that there was no discernible difference in the performance of the unit in two modes such result is expected since the influent flowrate of tf ozone contactor unit in the two modes were nearly similar i e 0 75 m3 h in single pass mode and 1 0 m3 h in return mode regardless of operation modes the tf ozone contactor unit was able to remove more than 20 of fe2 and 30 of n nh4 specifically the effluent fe2 and n nh4 concentrations from the tf ozone contactor unit in the single pass mode were 0 07 0 01 mg l and 0 21 0 01 mg l respectively in the return mode the effluent concentration of fe2 was 0 06 0 04 mg l while that of n nh4 was 0 26 0 02 mg l in this unit fe2 was likely converted to the less soluble fe3 inside both the tf and ozone contactor in the meantime nh4 was oxidized to no2 and no3 inside the tf by nitrifying bacteria indicated by the increase in nitrate concentration after tf treatment compared to the raw water i e from 0 19 0 07 mg l to 0 59 0 22 mg l in single pass mode and from 0 41 0 07 mg l to 0 52 0 10 mg l in the return mode the results of ferrous removal and ammonia conversion by the tf in both modes indicated that employing tf for pre treatment can reduce the ferrous and ammonia related chlorine demands thereby offering cost savings and reduction of thmfp 24 3 4 biomass properties in the tf ozone contactor unit operated in return mode since the tf ozone contactor operated in the return mode had a higher doc and nitrogen removal efficiencies it is of interest to characterize the biomass in the tf column the characterization results would provide more insight into the microorganism activities that occurred in this specific configuration detailed sampling locations within the tf column and the corresponding biomass properties are presented in sm figure s6 and table 2 respectively table 2 showed that there were distributions of the biomass per unit surface area of the media sheet as well as the maximum activities of aob and nob along the tf column notably the biomass per unit media area at the bottom filter section was 81 higher in the tvs content and 28 higher in the tvs ts ratio than that at the top filter section denser biomass content at deeper media depth may originate from the downwardly slipping of the slime layer fragment by gravity moreover the hydraulic shear force was likely inadequate to slough off this excess biofilm into the sludge hopper at the tf column bottom these combined effects could potentially lead to the high organic solid content accumulation and microorganism die off resulting in oxygen depletion process destabilization in the tf 25 table 2 also revealed that the activities of aob and nob considerably reduced from the top to the bottom of the filter as the biomass at the bottom section was 67 lower in the maximum aob activity and 97 lower in the maximum nob activity than the biomass at the top section oxygen deficiency caused by higher biomass content per unit area at the lower tf column expectedly hindered the growth of nitrifying bacteria which have a high oxygen demand for the oxidation of ammonia hence it is important to control the biomass sloughing off in the tf to improve its nitrification performance several methods can be used for this purpose such as using a high dose of daily intermittent flushing enhancing circulation rate uniformly distributing surface loading rate cleaning nozzle periodically and increasing the width and reducing the depth of the filter media 13 26 27 3 5 removal of dbp precursors and chlorine consuming substances in the bac downstream since the tf ozonation operated in the return mode had a higher removal efficiency for doc this mode was employed for further experiments after passing the tf ozone contactor the water 1 m3 h entered a rapid mixing box where it was mixed with pac and naoh solutions for subsequent turbidity removal in the fluidized bed clarifier then 0 35 m3 h of the clarifier effluent was directed to a bac unit run at an ebct of 25 min for further biological removal of reductants the performance of the bac in removing doc thmfp fe2 and n nh4 over 70 days is presented in fig 5 considering that the clarifier effluent was the bac influent as shown in fig 5a the bac removed 10 of doc i e from 2 9 to 2 6 mg l for comparison bac only removed 4 5 of doc at the same ebct using raw saigon river water as the influent in our previous study 12 a shorter ebct of 20 min resulted in a slightly higher doc removal 8 5 12 such low doc removal efficiencies of that study were possibly due to the low bdoc concentration in the bac influent raw water which was 0 22 0 40 mg l 12 on the contrary the bdoc in the bac influent of this study was 2 79 0 64 mg l fig 5a revealed that the thmfp decreased from 499 to 337 μg l after the bac unit corresponding to a thmfp removal of 32 interestingly this value was similar to the thmfp removal from the entire system comprising o3 uv and bac 40 12 the bac unit was also efficient in removing fe2 e g 49 from 0 06 to 0 03 mg l and nh4 n e g 29 from 0 24 to 0 17 mg l therefore the addition of the bac after tf ozone contactor and clarifier units was reasonable to improve further the quality of treated water 3 6 long term performance of the pilot treatment system in removing dbps and chlorine consuming substances in this study a pilot system comprising a tf ozone contactor unit operated in return mode a clarifier and a bac filtration unit was constructed its overall performance in removing doc thmfp fe2 and n nh4 for 70 days is also presented in fig 5a adverse impacts of highly fluctuated raw river water quality on the efficiency of the pilot system were expected since this test was conducted in the wet season however it can be observed from fig 5a that the performance of the pilot system was nearly stable for instance the standard errors of the measured data were relatively small also the mean concentration values before and after each treatment unit were significantly different in most cases therefore it is feasible to use this setup at a full scale level for year round treatment of sai gon river water the removal percentages of doc thmfp fe2 and nh4 n in all treatment units with reference to initial concentrations in the raw water are illustrated in fig 5b this figure shows that the tf ozone contactor unit operated in the return mode can remove considerable amounts of doc 25 thmfp 51 and n nh4 48 most of the fe2 was effectively eliminated in the clarifier 42 and the bac 29 the post treatment using bac also had a good performance in reducing thmfp 14 comparing to the raw water the effluent of this pilot system had much lower concentrations of substances of interest the whole system can remove up to nearly 50 of doc from 5 1 0 7 to 2 6 0 4 mg l 71 of thmfp from 1184 14 to 338 37 μg l 71 of fe2 from 0 100 0 01 to 0 03 0 01 mg l 74 of n nh4 from 0 66 0 01 to 0 17 0 02 mg l more details can be found in sm table s6 therefore it could be concluded that all the treatment units employed here were equally important and must be operated concurrently for obtaining the highest water quality 3 7 retrofitting solution and expected outcomes it was reported that the thmfp doc ratio of the water taken from the final treatment stage of thwtp i e rapid sand filtration was 221 μg thm mg doc 3 through a long term run with the pilot treatment system the ratio of thmfp doc of the treated water decreased from 230 to 132 μg thmfp mg doc such high reduction 40 could substantially reduce the potential formation of harmful dbps in the water distribution system where residual doc may have long exposure with chlorine at high concentrations therefore the thwtp should be retrofitted based on the pilot test results to minimize the formation of harmful dpbs and reduce the amount of chlorine consumption in the proposed retrofitting plan fig 6 tf ozone contactor unit operated in return mode would replace pre chlorination and therefore acts as a pre treatment process before the conventional turbidity removal bac would be a post treatment process for further removal of bdoc and ferrous after clarifier currently the thwtp daily consumes 1350 kg of cl2 for pre chlorination 120 kg of cl2 for primary disinfection and 225 kg of cl2 for secondary disinfection therefore a nearly 80 reduction in chlorine usage would be achieved as the retrofitting plan to be applied for drinking water production from saigon river water however it was estimated that the addition of tf ozonation and bac possibly doubles the actual treatment cost from 0 07 m3 to 0 14 usd m3 a rough order of magnitude estimate of the capital and treatment cost is provided in sm table s7 and table s8 from the experimental results the treated saigon river water after retrofit is expected to have doc and thmfp concentrations of 2 6 mg l and 338 μg l respectively this water would have a low fe2 concentration of 0 03 mg l while the n nh4 concentration would be 0 17 mg l future studies with longer duration are suggested to ensure the pilot system can handle high fluctuation in water quality due to seasonal changes also next studies can employ feedback dose control systems for ozone to assure that non biodegradable doc bdoc conversion always occurs at optimal ozone dosage more mechanistic insight regarding the removal of doc and thmfp could be obtained through future fractionation isolation and size fractionation analyses of the dom in the water samples taken in different treatment unit outlets detailed information on the formation of thms in the water distribution systems should also be obtained this data is essential for determining the removal degree of dpb precursors at the treatment plant to make sure that the water is safe at the consumers ends furthermore the use of ozone for both dbp precursor reduction and disinfection should be explored at a pilot scaled level to determine ozone concentrations needed for saigon river water treatment 4 conclusions experimental results over 300 days showed that the tf ozone contactor unit operated in return mode enhanced the removal of organic compounds in saigon river water as compared to single pass mode in both modes the ozone dosage of ca 3 1 mg l was not able to mineralize doc however it could convert recalcitrant doc to bdoc and subsequentially reduced about 45 of thmfp besides the removal of chlorine consuming substances such as fe2 and n nh4 in the tf ozone contactor unit was also similar in two modes i e 21 31 for fe2 and 34 42 for n nh4 the bac filtration unit downstream of was able to remove 11 of doc 32 of thmfp 49 of fe2 and 29 of n nh4 over 70 days of operation the long term performance of the entire pilot system comprising a tf ozone contactor unit operated in the return mode a coagulation tank a fluidized bed clarifier and a bac column in removing dpb precursors and chlorine consuming substances in saigon river water was evaluated over 70 days the system consistently removed 50 of doc 71 of thmfp 71 of fe2 and 74 of n nh4 at the final stage bac the water quality was dramatically improved e g 2 6 mg l doc 338 μg l thfmp 0 03 mg l fe2 and 0 17 mg l n nh4 the thmfp doc ratio of the treated water was 40 smaller than the one taken at the final stage of the current thwtp e g 132 vs 230 μg thmfp mg doc results from this study indicated that retrofitting the existing thwtp with the tested processes and removing pre chlorination stage can provide safer drinking water besides the consumption of chlorine would be drastically decreased as the current pre chlorination stage uses nearly 74 of daily chlorine consumption of the

13871,saigon river is the primary water supply source for ho chi minh city vietnam currently the formation of harmful disinfectant by products dbps in the piped water is elevating due to the increase in both organic matter pollution in saigon river and chloride usage at water treatment plants wtps to provide safe drinking water the wtps should upgrade their existing conventional surface water treatment technology to reduce dbp precursors and chlorine consuming substances efficiently in this study the long term performance of a pilot system including a biofiltration ozonation unit and a biological activated carbon bac filter in removing these compounds was evaluated different from other studies a tricking filter tf was placed before a low dose ozone contactor for water pretreatment by partially returning the ozonated water to the tf the removal of dissolved organic carbon doc which contains dbp precursors in the tf ozonation unit was doubled over two months operated with highly fluctuated river water quality in the rainy season the pilot systems stably removed 50 of doc 71 of trihalomethane formation potential thmfp 71 of fe2 and 74 of n nh4 the tf ozonation unit was effective in removing doc thmfp and nh4 while the bac filter was more effective in removing fe2 if implemented this system can replace the pre chlorination process accounting for 74 of daily chlorine consumption at tan hiep wtp the obtained results indicate that retrofitting wtps with the tested processes can provide safe drinking water for ho chi minh city residents in the future keywords disinfection by products dbps trihalomethane formation potential thmfp ozonation biofiltration dissolved organic carbon doc chlorine consuming substances 1 introduction saigon river is the raw surface water source for water supply systems of ho chi minh city the most significant economic hub of vietnam currently river water quality has been declined due to urbanization agriculture and aquaculture activities 1 particularly the concentrations of pollutants such as nutrients pathogen and organic compounds have gradually increased 1 tan hiep water treatment plant thwtp is currently supplying 300 000 m3 day to the city s residents using the water taken from saigon river to ensure that the supplied water meet the drinking water quality standards qcvn 01 2009 byt national technical regulation on drinking water 2 thwtp has to employ a large amount of chlorine in a pretreatment process to remove iron color odor algae and other organisms afterward the water was treated by conventional processes such as coagulation flocculation sedimentation granular media filtration and chlorine disinfection 3 a flow process outline of this water treatment plant is illustrated in supplementary material sm figure s1 the use of high amount of chlorine for both pre chlorination and disinfection 3 3 6 5 mg l in the presence of elevated amount of organic matter in saigon river raw water i e 3 1 0 25 mg l dissolved organic carbon doc resulted in the formation of the harmful disinfection by products dbps such as trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids 3 dbps are known for possibly causing severe problems in the liver kidney central nervous systems and increased risk of cancer 4 it was reported that the amount of thms formed after disinfection in thwtp was 155 8 μg l 3 although this thm concentration currently meets the drinking water quality standards in vietnam it is higher than the total thm level allowed by the u s environmental protection agency epa 0 08 mg l 4 due to the increase in pollution in saigon river water the thms produced from thwtp would be inevitably higher than the reported value in the future therefore thwtp needs to find practical strategies to minimize the formation of dbps and reduction of chlorine demand such as lowering the amount of reducing agents that easily react with chlorine e g doc ferrous and ammonia membrane and adsorption processes can be used the remove dbps once they are formed in the water 5 6 a more proactive approach is controlling the formation of these chemicals by i using different disinfectants or removing their precursors such as natural organic matter nom 7 the presence of nom in water could be reduced effectively by various methods including enhanced coagulation 8 9 and coagulation based integrated processes such as coagulation membrane filtration coagulation adsorption oxidation coagulation and coagulation ion exchange 9 however the use of coagulation for nom removal usually results in a higher demand for chemicals and more production of sludge 9 other methods for removing nom involve the combinational use of ozone at low concentration smaller than 4 mg l and biotreatment 10 in this case a fraction of recalcitrant organic matter became biodegradable through ozonation and therefore could be removed by the following biological processes 10 bond et al summarized that the removal of thm precursors by ozone biofiltration processes was highly fluctuated from 5 to 55 7 through a pilot study with water taken from huangpu river in shanghai china that had a doc concentration of 6 7 mg l the combination of conventional processes i e coagulation flocculation sedimentation and granular filtration removed only 26 of doc 11 however when this water was further treated with o3 biological activated carbon bac the percentage of doc removal reached to 50 11 the coupling of o3 uv and bac for treating saigon river water was investigated over six months also at pilot scale in our previous study 12 such integration resulted in only 18 removal of doc and 39 of trihalomethane formation potential thmfp among various biological processes trickling filtration tf is known for efficiently removing biodegradable doc bdoc by heterotrophic bacteria and converting ammonia to nitrate by autotrophic nitrifying bacteria 13 therefore this process could be a promising candidate for removing high levels of doc and chlorine consuming substances e g ammonia in saigon river water based on the presented information it was hypothesized that the use of tf followed by ozonation and returning the ozonated water to the tf for further removal of bdoc could be a potential approach to minimize thmfp this specific configuration could have several advantages over the usual ozonation biofiltration setup for instance fractions of recalcitrant nom can undergo more ozone oxidation iterations possibly resulting in a higher amount of nom removal besides as biodegradable nom and ammonia are already consumed in the tf ozone likely reacts only with recalcitrant nom thus the amount of the supplied ozone would be reduced since fe2 and n nh4 could be converted to fe3 and no3 in both biological and ozonation processes the combination of the tf and ozonation was also expected to lower the consumption of chlorine for pre chlorination however the actual performance of such treatment configuration has not been investigated therefore this study aims to evaluate the efficiency of a pilot system which contained a tf ozonation unit followed by bac filtration for long term removal of dbp precursors and chlorine consuming substances from saigon river water it has been reported that thms are easier to be detected than other dbps and there is a good correlation between trichloromethane a thm and other dbp concentrations 14 compared with haa formation potential haafp thmfp was more challenging to be removed by only oxidation 15 and ozone uv bac processes 12 therefore thm was the only dbp of interest in this study the experiments were properly designed and the amount of obtained data was adequate for meaningful statistical analyses based on the obtained experimental results a practical recommendation for retrofitting the current thwtp to comply with stricter future water quality standards on dbps will be proposed if this plan is successfully implemented the saigon river would still be the main supply of safe drinking water for ho chi minh city residents 2 materials and methods 2 1 raw surface water the raw water was collected directly from saigon river at hoa phu pumping station of thwtp the duration of the experiment was ten months from october 2015 to august 2016 the properties of this raw water are shown in table 1 the dissolved organic matter dom fractionation and isolation of the water samples was out of the study scope and therefore not performed the river water was then transferred to a 1 m3 stainless steel tank using a centrifugal pump cma 0 5 m ebara italy the water ph was adjusted to 6 5 7 5 by a ph controller pc 310 suntex instruments taiwan and a dosing pump pulsafeeder usa using 3 naoh solution at the storage tank before entering subsequent biological treatment processes 2 2 configuration of the pilot system the simplified flow schematic diagram of the pilot system is illustrated in fig 1 for enhancing nitrification and ferrous oxidation ph value of the raw water was adjusted to the range of 7 0 7 5 after contacting the biofilm in the tricking filter the water was passed through a venturi tube where ozone gas was injected into the water stream under negative pressure next the water ozone mixture was transferred to the ozone contactor the supplied ozone was generated from an ozonator at a feed rate of 20 g o3 h obm vietnam depending on the operation mode which is presented in section 2 3 a fraction of effluent from the ozone contactor was returned to the tf for further treatment of bdoc formed from the breaking down of nom by ozonation the ozonated water was then pumped to a rapid mixing box placed at the top of a fluidized bed clarifier it was then dosed with 3 poly aluminum chloride pac and 3 naoh solution finally the supernatant from the clarifier was pumped to a bac column for further removal of dpb precursors and chlorine consuming substances a detailed description of the pilot system can be found in the sm 2 3 operation of the tf ozone contactor unit to find the effects of returning ozonated water to the tf the tf ozone contactor unit was operated in two modes which were single pass and return modes in the single pass mode the tf was initially set to receive 1 0 m3 h of ph adjusted raw water however actual measurement at the field showed that the feed flow rate in this mode was only 0 75 m3 h which was equivalent to a hydraulic loading rate hlr of 3 m3 m2 h for the tf and a hydraulic retention time hrt of 25 min for the ozone contactor the single pass mode was operated over 69 days in the return mode the tf received a mixed flow 2 0 m3 h of ph adjusted raw water 1 0 m3 h and ozonated water 1 0 m3 h corresponding to a total hlr of 8 m3 m2 h then the whole stream from the tf was pumped to the ozone contactor in this case the hrt of the ozone contactor was 15 min the effluent from the ozone contactor was split into two flows one flow was returned to the tf 1 0 m3 h and the other 1 0 m3 h was fed to the rapid mixing box of the clarifier for turbidity removal compared to the single mode the tf and ozone contactor were operated at higher hlr and shorter hrts in the return mode i e 8 m3 m2 h vs 3 m3 m2 h of hlr in the tf and 15 vs 25 min of hrt in the ozone contactor the return mode was studied over 230 days right after the single pass mode run was finished operating conditions of the tf and its influent water quality at two modes are presented in sm table s4 the total amount of o3 supplied in both single pass and return modes was 3 1 mg l 2 4 operation of the bac column the effluent from the clarifier was fed to the bac column at a flow rate of 0 35 m3 h corresponding to an empty bed contact time ebct of 25 min and a filtration velocity of 3 5 m h the characteristic of the feed water is presented in table s4 in the sm the bac column was operated for 70 days during which the tf ozone was in the return mode the timeline of each type of experiment is presented in the sm figure s4 2 5 enrichment of the biological filters both the tf and bac column were enriched with 2 l of seeding sludge containing nitrifying bacteria during two weeks of starting up the seed sludge was taken from a sequential batch reactor containing mass liquor suspended solids and mass liquor volatile suspended solids concentrations of 1700 mg l and 1200 mg l respectively during the enrichment the ph of feed water was maintained at 7 0 7 4 the tf and bac were run at a flow rate of 0 75 m3 h and 0 35 m3 h respectively 2 6 chemicals and analytical methods analytical graded chemicals merck kgaa darmstadt germany were used for determining water quality parameters technical graded chemicals were used for adjusting ph and facilitating sedimentation water quality parameters such as ph turbidity color fe2 n nh4 alkalinity doc total solids ts total volatile solids tvs and thmfp were measured using standardized methods 16 bdoc was obtained from the decrease in doc concentration due to bacterial activities when the water sample was inoculated for 7 10 days in the dark with saturated gac 12 17 this material was taken from a household scale bac column operated for more than one year 12 17 detailed procedures for thmfp doc and bdoc measurements can be found from our previous studies 3 12 the amount of reacting ozone was estimated based on the amount of ozone from the generator output residual dissolved ozone and non dissolved ozone i e free ozone gas the amount of generated ozone and free ozone gas was measured using ki traps and titration with na2s2o3 16 method 2350e meanwhile the dissolved ozone remaining in the water after oxidation was measured via the indigo colorimetric method 16 method 4500 the amount of reacting ozone was obtained by subtracting the amount of free ozone gas and residual dissolved ozone from the total generated ozone maximum activities of ammonium oxidation bacteria aob and nitrite oxidation bacteria nob determined through batch tests 18 were used to assess the nitrogen conversion of the tf biomass summary of analytical methods and instrument employed in this study are listed in sm table s5 2 7 data processing and visualization all the data presented in this study were mean values standard errors paired two tailed t tests were employed to compare the results before and after treatment for comparing the treatment efficiencies of different operating modes f tests were firstly conducted to check the variance of the data sets then two tailed t tests were performed with either equal or unequal variance assumption depending on the preceding f test results 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal of dpb precursors in tf ozone contactor unit operated in single pass mode the concentrations of doc bdoc thmfp fe2 and n nh4 in the raw water tf influent tf effluent ozone contactor influent and ozone contactor effluent during the entire experimental duration was detailly presented in sm figure s5 in single pass mode there was no returning flow from the ozone contactor back to the tf hlr of the tf and the hrt of the ozone contactor were 3 m3 m2 h and 25 min respectively the removal of doc and bdoc in this setup calculated from the sm figure s5 data is presented in fig 2 initially the feed raw water contained 3 17 0 06 mg l doc and 0 54 0 04 mg l bdoc bdoc doc 0 17 after tf treatment these values decreased to 3 02 0 07 mg l doc and 0 37 0 06 mg l bdoc in this case although the tf was able to remove 30 bdoc its overall doc removal was negligible after sequentially passing out the ozone contactor the effluent contained a doc concentration of 2 89 0 09 mg l such small decrease in doc concentration from 3 02 to 2 89 mg l indicated that the employed ozonation was not effective in mineralizing nom at ozone concentration used in this study 3 1 mg l however it was observed that the amount of bdoc drastically increased after ozonation from 0 37 0 06 to 0 9 0 11 mg l bdoc resulting in 80 increase in the bdoc doc ratio i e 0 12 after tf vs 0 31 after ozonation similar increase in bdoc doc ratio was also observed in the coupling of ozonation and uv for treating the fluidized clarifier effluent of tan hiep wtp i e bdoc doc ratio increased from 0 12 to 0 28 12 therefore it could be concluded that while the tf ozone contactor unit operated in the single pass mode had low doc removal efficiency 9 it was highly effective in converting recalcitrant doc to bdoc this result is expected since ozonation can convert non biodegradable macromolecular compounds to biodegradable ones through the breakdown of large molecules 19 for instance li et al showed that the concentration of molecules having the molecular weight of 1000 3000 da increased by 9 after ozonation 19 thmfp was removed predominantly in the ozone contactor as 895 11 μg l of thmfp in the feed water was reduced to only 806 2 μg l in the tf and eventually to 489 25 μg l in the ozone contactor it was likely that the microorganisms in the tf did not consume the hydrophobic acid fraction of the doc which are was the most reactive thm precursor 20 in the feed water as the biological process was capable of removing hydrophilic and hydrophobic base neutral fractions 21 such speculation could also lead to a conclusion that these fractions were not the major components of the dom in the raw water the observed low doc removal 4 and high thmfp reduction 45 in the ozone contactor unit was in agreement with galapate et al 22 and was likely caused by the alteration of dom properties after ozonation 22 specifically it was reported that ozone could i convert the more reactive hydrophobic dom to the less reactive hydrophilic dom ii reduce the reactivity of these both types of dom and iii reduce the reactivity of reactive sites of the dom molecules 22 3 2 removal of dpb precursors in tf ozone contactor unit operated in return mode in the return mode 50 of the effluent flow from the ozone contactor i e 1 m3 h was returned and mixed with 1 m3 h of raw water to tf therefore the tf ozone contactor unit was run at a total flow rate of 2 m3 h equivalent to a hlr of 8 m3 m2 h for the tf and a hrt of 15 min for the ozone contactor the organic content concentrations in the raw water the influent and the effluent of both tf and ozone contactor are presented in fig 3 the doc and bdoc in the influent of the tf were 3 96 0 30 and 1 17 0 27 mg l respectively fig 3 the bdoc doc ratio in this water was 0 24 which was higher than that of the raw water bdoc doc 0 17 because the return water from the ozone contactor had a high concentration of bdoc this matter will be discussed later in this section in the return mode the tf removed more than 40 of bdoc resulting in an effluent bdoc concentration of 0 69 0 17 mg l in comparison with the single pass mode the bdoc mass loading rate and bdoc removal rate in the return mode were 5 8 and 7 0 times higher 187 g m2 d vs 32 g m2 d and 77 g m2 d vs 10 g m2 d respectively such result indicated that the return mode had created a favorable condition for heterotrophic bacterial activities in the tf filter possibly due to the more abundant of bdoc substrate and dissolved oxygen do as ozonated water was saturated with dissolved oxygen i e 7 3 mg l at 34 c in the tf 14 doc removal was observed as the doc in the tf effluent reduced from 3 96 0 30 3 67 0 22 mg l from ozone concentration measurements in the water and the gas phases it was estimated that 92 of the supplied ozone underwent reaction in the ozone contactor responding to a low ozone dosage of 0 84 go3 gdoc through ozonation the bdoc value increased dramatically from 0 69 0 17 mg l to 1 37 0 23 mg l while the doc slightly decreased from 3 67 0 22 mg l to 3 40 0 22 mg l this observation further confirmed that the main effect of low dose ozonation was converting recalcitrant doc to bdoc not removing doc 7 23 compared to the single pass mode the shorter hrt of the ozone contactor in the return mode 15 min vs 25 min likely did not affect the conversion of recalcitrant doc to bdoc as the calculated conversion percentages in both modes were similar 18 this observation is in agreement with a previous study in which the conversion of doc to bdoc stagnated although the reaction time was increased 11 particularly 32 5 g d of recalcitrant doc was estimated to become bdoc from a total doc mass loading rate of 176 gdoc d in the return mode in the single pass mode 9 6 g d of recalcitrant doc converted to bdoc from an overall doc mass loading rate of 54 3 gdoc d fig 4 a shows the changes of bdoc doc ratio of the raw water together with effluents of tf and ozone contactor in both single pass and return modes this figure demonstrates that the return mode resulted in a higher bdoc doc ratio than the single pass mode in the ozone contactor outlet 0 40 vs 0 31 with a p value of 0 10 therefore the performance of biological processes occurring in the tf film such as biodegradable organic removal by aerobic heterotrophic bacteria and denitrification by anoxic denitrifying bacteria was higher in the return mode as expected i e 40 bdoc removal in the return mode vs 30 in the single pass mode experimental results also revealed that the thmfp removal process occurred in both tf and ozonation not just in ozonation as in the single pass mode in the return mode an initial thmfp concentration of 1041 15 μg l at the tf inlet was stepwise reduced to 887 14 μg l at the tf outlet and then to 674 14 μg l at the ozone contactor outlet through ozonation the non biodegradable hydrophobic acid fraction in the raw water which is the most reactive thm precursors 20 might have been transformed into the biodegradable hydrophilic and hydrophobic base neutral fractions 11 as mentioned earlier therefore the partial returning of ozonated water to the tf was expected to promote thmfp reduction via microorganism activities this observed thmfp reduction is consistent with the earlier hypothesis that hydrophobic acid was the major fraction of dom in the tested raw water within the boundary of the tf ozone contactor unit presented in fig 1 the influent and effluent streams of the entire tf ozone contactor unit were similar in both modes i e 0 75 and 1 0 m3 h for single pass mode and return mode respectively as a result the overall doc removal of the tf ozonation contactor unit in these two modes could be reasonably compared a comparable removal efficiency in both modes suggest a better performance in the return mode as well fig 4b showed that tf ozone contactor unit operated in the return mode removed 17 9 of doc while only 8 6 of doc was removed in the single pass mode it is indeed concluded that the return of ozonated water to the tf greatly enhanced the doc removal performance of the entire tf ozone contactor unit as illustrated in fig 4b thmfp reduction was 45 in both single pass and return modes although the doc removal percentage was much lower i e 8 6 17 9 the o3 dosage used here 3 1 g m3 at 34 c or 0 84 go3 gdoc was possibly just enough to increase the bdoc doc ratio not to mineralize organic matter directly despite the similar thmfp removal efficiencies in both modes more thmfp was eliminated in the return mode as the thmfp in the feed water in this case was higher than that in the single pass mode 1220 13 μg l vs 895 11 μg l due to seasonal changes it should be also noted that the influent flow rate of the system was also slightly higher in the return mode 3 3 removal of chlorine consuming substances in tf ozone contactor unit the thwtp currently employs a pre chlorination process for iron color and algae removal prior to turbidity treatment using coagulation flocculation sedimentation and rapid sand filtration however this process could result in a high potential formation of thms due to the presence of elevated chlorine and dbp precursor concentrations therefore the removal of chlorine consumption substances such as fe2 and nh4 in the tf ozone contactor unit were also of importance in this study detailed information on the removal of fe2 and n nh4 in the tf ozone contactor unit operated in both single pass and return modes can be found from fig 4b this figure clearly showed that there was no discernible difference in the performance of the unit in two modes such result is expected since the influent flowrate of tf ozone contactor unit in the two modes were nearly similar i e 0 75 m3 h in single pass mode and 1 0 m3 h in return mode regardless of operation modes the tf ozone contactor unit was able to remove more than 20 of fe2 and 30 of n nh4 specifically the effluent fe2 and n nh4 concentrations from the tf ozone contactor unit in the single pass mode were 0 07 0 01 mg l and 0 21 0 01 mg l respectively in the return mode the effluent concentration of fe2 was 0 06 0 04 mg l while that of n nh4 was 0 26 0 02 mg l in this unit fe2 was likely converted to the less soluble fe3 inside both the tf and ozone contactor in the meantime nh4 was oxidized to no2 and no3 inside the tf by nitrifying bacteria indicated by the increase in nitrate concentration after tf treatment compared to the raw water i e from 0 19 0 07 mg l to 0 59 0 22 mg l in single pass mode and from 0 41 0 07 mg l to 0 52 0 10 mg l in the return mode the results of ferrous removal and ammonia conversion by the tf in both modes indicated that employing tf for pre treatment can reduce the ferrous and ammonia related chlorine demands thereby offering cost savings and reduction of thmfp 24 3 4 biomass properties in the tf ozone contactor unit operated in return mode since the tf ozone contactor operated in the return mode had a higher doc and nitrogen removal efficiencies it is of interest to characterize the biomass in the tf column the characterization results would provide more insight into the microorganism activities that occurred in this specific configuration detailed sampling locations within the tf column and the corresponding biomass properties are presented in sm figure s6 and table 2 respectively table 2 showed that there were distributions of the biomass per unit surface area of the media sheet as well as the maximum activities of aob and nob along the tf column notably the biomass per unit media area at the bottom filter section was 81 higher in the tvs content and 28 higher in the tvs ts ratio than that at the top filter section denser biomass content at deeper media depth may originate from the downwardly slipping of the slime layer fragment by gravity moreover the hydraulic shear force was likely inadequate to slough off this excess biofilm into the sludge hopper at the tf column bottom these combined effects could potentially lead to the high organic solid content accumulation and microorganism die off resulting in oxygen depletion process destabilization in the tf 25 table 2 also revealed that the activities of aob and nob considerably reduced from the top to the bottom of the filter as the biomass at the bottom section was 67 lower in the maximum aob activity and 97 lower in the maximum nob activity than the biomass at the top section oxygen deficiency caused by higher biomass content per unit area at the lower tf column expectedly hindered the growth of nitrifying bacteria which have a high oxygen demand for the oxidation of ammonia hence it is important to control the biomass sloughing off in the tf to improve its nitrification performance several methods can be used for this purpose such as using a high dose of daily intermittent flushing enhancing circulation rate uniformly distributing surface loading rate cleaning nozzle periodically and increasing the width and reducing the depth of the filter media 13 26 27 3 5 removal of dbp precursors and chlorine consuming substances in the bac downstream since the tf ozonation operated in the return mode had a higher removal efficiency for doc this mode was employed for further experiments after passing the tf ozone contactor the water 1 m3 h entered a rapid mixing box where it was mixed with pac and naoh solutions for subsequent turbidity removal in the fluidized bed clarifier then 0 35 m3 h of the clarifier effluent was directed to a bac unit run at an ebct of 25 min for further biological removal of reductants the performance of the bac in removing doc thmfp fe2 and n nh4 over 70 days is presented in fig 5 considering that the clarifier effluent was the bac influent as shown in fig 5a the bac removed 10 of doc i e from 2 9 to 2 6 mg l for comparison bac only removed 4 5 of doc at the same ebct using raw saigon river water as the influent in our previous study 12 a shorter ebct of 20 min resulted in a slightly higher doc removal 8 5 12 such low doc removal efficiencies of that study were possibly due to the low bdoc concentration in the bac influent raw water which was 0 22 0 40 mg l 12 on the contrary the bdoc in the bac influent of this study was 2 79 0 64 mg l fig 5a revealed that the thmfp decreased from 499 to 337 μg l after the bac unit corresponding to a thmfp removal of 32 interestingly this value was similar to the thmfp removal from the entire system comprising o3 uv and bac 40 12 the bac unit was also efficient in removing fe2 e g 49 from 0 06 to 0 03 mg l and nh4 n e g 29 from 0 24 to 0 17 mg l therefore the addition of the bac after tf ozone contactor and clarifier units was reasonable to improve further the quality of treated water 3 6 long term performance of the pilot treatment system in removing dbps and chlorine consuming substances in this study a pilot system comprising a tf ozone contactor unit operated in return mode a clarifier and a bac filtration unit was constructed its overall performance in removing doc thmfp fe2 and n nh4 for 70 days is also presented in fig 5a adverse impacts of highly fluctuated raw river water quality on the efficiency of the pilot system were expected since this test was conducted in the wet season however it can be observed from fig 5a that the performance of the pilot system was nearly stable for instance the standard errors of the measured data were relatively small also the mean concentration values before and after each treatment unit were significantly different in most cases therefore it is feasible to use this setup at a full scale level for year round treatment of sai gon river water the removal percentages of doc thmfp fe2 and nh4 n in all treatment units with reference to initial concentrations in the raw water are illustrated in fig 5b this figure shows that the tf ozone contactor unit operated in the return mode can remove considerable amounts of doc 25 thmfp 51 and n nh4 48 most of the fe2 was effectively eliminated in the clarifier 42 and the bac 29 the post treatment using bac also had a good performance in reducing thmfp 14 comparing to the raw water the effluent of this pilot system had much lower concentrations of substances of interest the whole system can remove up to nearly 50 of doc from 5 1 0 7 to 2 6 0 4 mg l 71 of thmfp from 1184 14 to 338 37 μg l 71 of fe2 from 0 100 0 01 to 0 03 0 01 mg l 74 of n nh4 from 0 66 0 01 to 0 17 0 02 mg l more details can be found in sm table s6 therefore it could be concluded that all the treatment units employed here were equally important and must be operated concurrently for obtaining the highest water quality 3 7 retrofitting solution and expected outcomes it was reported that the thmfp doc ratio of the water taken from the final treatment stage of thwtp i e rapid sand filtration was 221 μg thm mg doc 3 through a long term run with the pilot treatment system the ratio of thmfp doc of the treated water decreased from 230 to 132 μg thmfp mg doc such high reduction 40 could substantially reduce the potential formation of harmful dbps in the water distribution system where residual doc may have long exposure with chlorine at high concentrations therefore the thwtp should be retrofitted based on the pilot test results to minimize the formation of harmful dpbs and reduce the amount of chlorine consumption in the proposed retrofitting plan fig 6 tf ozone contactor unit operated in return mode would replace pre chlorination and therefore acts as a pre treatment process before the conventional turbidity removal bac would be a post treatment process for further removal of bdoc and ferrous after clarifier currently the thwtp daily consumes 1350 kg of cl2 for pre chlorination 120 kg of cl2 for primary disinfection and 225 kg of cl2 for secondary disinfection therefore a nearly 80 reduction in chlorine usage would be achieved as the retrofitting plan to be applied for drinking water production from saigon river water however it was estimated that the addition of tf ozonation and bac possibly doubles the actual treatment cost from 0 07 m3 to 0 14 usd m3 a rough order of magnitude estimate of the capital and treatment cost is provided in sm table s7 and table s8 from the experimental results the treated saigon river water after retrofit is expected to have doc and thmfp concentrations of 2 6 mg l and 338 μg l respectively this water would have a low fe2 concentration of 0 03 mg l while the n nh4 concentration would be 0 17 mg l future studies with longer duration are suggested to ensure the pilot system can handle high fluctuation in water quality due to seasonal changes also next studies can employ feedback dose control systems for ozone to assure that non biodegradable doc bdoc conversion always occurs at optimal ozone dosage more mechanistic insight regarding the removal of doc and thmfp could be obtained through future fractionation isolation and size fractionation analyses of the dom in the water samples taken in different treatment unit outlets detailed information on the formation of thms in the water distribution systems should also be obtained this data is essential for determining the removal degree of dpb precursors at the treatment plant to make sure that the water is safe at the consumers ends furthermore the use of ozone for both dbp precursor reduction and disinfection should be explored at a pilot scaled level to determine ozone concentrations needed for saigon river water treatment 4 conclusions experimental results over 300 days showed that the tf ozone contactor unit operated in return mode enhanced the removal of organic compounds in saigon river water as compared to single pass mode in both modes the ozone dosage of ca 3 1 mg l was not able to mineralize doc however it could convert recalcitrant doc to bdoc and subsequentially reduced about 45 of thmfp besides the removal of chlorine consuming substances such as fe2 and n nh4 in the tf ozone contactor unit was also similar in two modes i e 21 31 for fe2 and 34 42 for n nh4 the bac filtration unit downstream of was able to remove 11 of doc 32 of thmfp 49 of fe2 and 29 of n nh4 over 70 days of operation the long term performance of the entire pilot system comprising a tf ozone contactor unit operated in the return mode a coagulation tank a fluidized bed clarifier and a bac column in removing dpb precursors and chlorine consuming substances in saigon river water was evaluated over 70 days the system consistently removed 50 of doc 71 of thmfp 71 of fe2 and 74 of n nh4 at the final stage bac the water quality was dramatically improved e g 2 6 mg l doc 338 μg l thfmp 0 03 mg l fe2 and 0 17 mg l n nh4 the thmfp doc ratio of the treated water was 40 smaller than the one taken at the final stage of the current thwtp e g 132 vs 230 μg thmfp mg doc results from this study indicated that retrofitting the existing thwtp with the tested processes and removing pre chlorination stage can provide safer drinking water besides the consumption of chlorine would be drastically decreased as the current pre chlorination stage uses nearly 74 of daily chlorine consumption of the

13872,the goal of the study was to treat nitrogen rich digester supernatant for water reuse in a three stage system with an aerobic granular sludge batch reactor gsbr a post denitrification p d reactor and a membrane module in the study the effects on treatment efficiency of organic loading and aeration mode in the gsbr the type of waste organics in p d and the parameters of filtration were investigated denitrification efficiency was highest in the gsbr operated with 2 anoxic phases in the cycle and at 1 8 g cod l d but in this reactor the n no2 n no3 ratio was the highest 2 43 shortening the anoxic period in the cycle and increasing organic loading to 2 1 g cod l d decreased nitrite accumulation in the effluent the n no2 n no3 ratio of 0 23 the effluents with different n no2 n no3 ratios were subjected to p d with glycerin fraction gl distillery residue dr and volatile fatty acids vfas as waste organic sources p d of nitrate rich gsbr effluent with vfa resulted in denitrification efficiency up to 97 9 and followed by microfiltration produced a final stream that could be directly discharged to the environment or used for irrigation the use of p d with gl and dr was most efficient for the treatment of gsbr effluent in which nitrite predominated denitrification efficiencies reached 26 7 with gl and 22 0 with dr after polishing by ultrafiltration the final stream had low cod and color no turbidity high concentrations of nox and could be used for algae growth for bioproduct recovery keywords post denitrification aerobic granules waste glycerin distillery residue volatile fatty acid membrane filtration 1 introduction currently because of the need to lower the consumption of fresh water due to the reduced availability and quality of water resources wastewater reclamation and reuse has gained interest as an environmentally and economically viable option for municipal activities in many developing communities non potable water reuse particularly for agricultural irrigation is gaining popularity 1 the us environmental protection agency 2 suggests guidelines for reuse of water from municipal wastewater treatment plants with a low contribution of industrial wastewater although these guidelines are site specific and use dependent their fulfillment requires advanced methods of wastewater treatment one of the main by products of biological wastewater treatment is anaerobic digester supernatant that contains relatively low cod concentrations and high nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in some wastewater treatment plants this supernatant is treated in the main stream although this additional stream contributes only 2 to the total flow through the plant its nitrogen load is 25 of the total nitrogen load 3 it is advantageous to focus on separate treatment of this small stream with advanced methods instead of treating it in the main stream which would require larger bioreactors and higher energy demands treatment of anaerobic digester supernatant in the side stream in a batch reactor with activated sludge with intermittent aeration phases in the reactor cycle ph regulation and at reduced oxygen concentration did not allow for full ammonium oxidation and denitrification but produced an influent suitable for anammox reactors 50 50 ammonium nitrite 4 on the other hand over 90 efficiency of denitrification of anaerobic digester supernatant was observed by fux et al 5 however it was obtained either in a full scale sbr operated at a long hydraulic retention time sludge age and with an addition of pure organics such as ethanol and methanol to support denitrification or in a continuous flow sharon reactor but at a total hrt greater than 4 days and at 29 c application of pure organics long hydraulic retention times and high temperature decreased the economical attractiveness of these process separate treatment of the supernatant can be performed in systems with aerobic granular sludge batch reactors gsbrs which enables efficient removal of ammonium but produces effluent with a high concentration of oxidized nitrogen 6 to remove nitrate and nitrite anoxic phases can be introduced to the gsbr cycle 7 or a second purification step that only targets denitrification of oxidized nitrogen forms can be added the gsbr effluent usually contains high concentrations of total solids because all slow settling biomass must be removed for effective granulation the presence of biomass in purified effluents worsens their quality but can be advantageous if the activity of biomass will be used for further biological treatment of wastewater because the metabolic pathways are distinct between different systems depending on their microbial composition the optimal cod n ratio for a biological denitrification system for treating a specific wastewater must be determined experimentally 8 the selection of a carbon source should take into account its cost and content of adverse toxic compounds the degree to which it can be degraded the resulting denitrification rate process kinetics and production of sludge and whether full denitrification will be possible without biomass adaptation 9 although short chain compounds such as methanol ethanol or acetate have advantages as carbon sources for denitrification 10 they are expensive so it is preferable to use waste carbon sources one potential carbon source is distillery residue dr it is a by product of ethyl alcohol production from substrates that are rich in simple and complex sugars this waste has a high content of easily biodegradable organic substances although most of them are in a form of suspended solids 11 another potential carbon source is waste glycerin fraction gl which is a by product of rapeseed oil methanolysis for biodiesel production gl contains 30 40 glycerol up to 50 soaps and emulsified methyl esters and the rest is methanol and water 12 an attractive carbon source is short chain volatile fatty acids vfas in wastewater treatment systems vfas are released during the hydrolysis of primary sludge in the fermenter 13 and then introduced into the biological part of the wastewater treatment plant i e to denitrification or dephosphatation tanks for wastewater reclamation and reuse membrane separation is the most promising solution 14 for reducing suspended solids and cod low pressure techniques i e microfiltration mf and ultrafiltration uf are used because they are more economical than the other processes due to their high flux with a low energy input 15 mf and uf can be employed in a combination of physical chemical and biological processes in two treatment options i in membrane bioreactor mbr technology that integrates biological treatment with mf or uf or ii as a post treatment for tertiary treatment of municipal wastewater to achieve high effluent quality 16 the first option mbr has many advantages such as excellent effluent quality and a small footprint however mbrs have been used mainly for treatment of municipal wastewater with low concentrations of nitrogen 40 mg tn l where the influent was split into an aerobic tank and an anoxic tank 17 reports on the use of mbrs for treatment of digester supernatant are scarce for effective denitrification in these cases pure carbon sources such as methanol or acetic acids have been used 18 in a water stressed developing community the second option post treatment was preferred for non potable water reuse because it is less costly than the first 19 permeates from biological treatment and mf or uf have been directly reused for irrigation 20 recirculated to the system as a technological water 21 22 or used for recreational purposes after removal of residual color 23 ceramic membranes are more resistant to both corrosive chemicals and extremes of ph and temperature than most commonly used polymeric membranes 24 ceramic membranes are highly porous and strongly hydrophilic therefore they can reach much higher flux than polymer membranes because of weaker bonding between foulants and the membrane material 25 tubular ceramic membranes are particularly suitable in applications where the feed solution contains a relatively high proportion of large particles thus although polymeric membranes have lower initial costs ceramic membranes are worth investigating because their advantages make them more competitive with polymeric membranes over the long term the objective of the study was to optimize an operation of a three stage system consisting of a gsbr post denitrification p d reactor and membrane filtration for treatment of a nitrogen rich digester supernatant for water reuse the innovative strategy was to add to the gsbr membrane system a p d step which was supported by organic wastes and carried out by the biomass present in the gsbr effluent such an approach changed the high concentrations of suspended solids in gsbr effluent into an advantage in the study low pressure membrane techniques using ceramic membranes with different cut off levels were applied the proposed technological solution is in line with the assumptions of a modern circular economy which requires both the development of technological solutions that will produce high quality reusable effluent via efficient treatment of wastewater and the utilization of wastes especially those from the agro food sector 2 materials and methods the organization of the experiment is presented in fig 1 in the present study to ensure efficient nitrification in the gsbrs a three stage system was used fig 1sm the effluents from the gsbrs contained about 0 45 0 50 g mlss l and this biomass reduced nox in the p d reactors the maintenance of a low concentration of biomass in the p d reactors had two main advantages first the reactor was a simple to operate retention tank that did not require biomass monitoring and recirculation or sludge age monitoring second the low biomass concentration lowers the solids load on the membrane unit which decreases the frequency of membrane washing 2 1 substrate anaerobic digester supernatant was obtained from the municipal wastewater treatment plant in olsztyn poland the concentrations of pollutants were about 1024 9 13 7 mg cod l 443 9 51 9 mg tn l 377 6 42 5 mg n nh4 l and 261 0 94 1 mg p l to ensure nitrification in gsbrs carbonates and bicarbonates were added to the supernatant in theoretical amounts 2 2 gsbrs stage i the experiment was conducted in three column gsbrs with a working volume of 4 l and a height to diameter ratio of 10 the reactors were operated by programmable logic controllers at a volumetric exchange rate of 67 and a temperature of 26 c air was supplied via aeration grids in the bottom of the gsbrs with a superficial air velocity of 0 8 cm s the concentration of free dissolved oxygen was at a level of 1 mg l during the first 3 4 hours of the cycle until the ammonium was oxidized and increased to 5 6 mg l at the end of the cycle the reactors were seeded with aerobic granular sludge cultivated with digester supernatant during a previous experiment 7 the sludge retention time in all gsbrs was at a level of 6 days all gsbrs were operated with an 8 h cycle resulting in a hydraulic retention time of 12 h filling settling and decantation each lasted for 5 min the first reactor r1 was operated at nitrogen and organic loadings of 0 8 g tn l d and 1 8 g cod l d respectively and with two 1 h anoxic phases in the cycle at the beginning and after 4 5 h of the cycle the second reactor r2 was operated at identical nitrogen and organic loadings but with only one 1 h anoxic phase at the beginning of the cycle the third reactor r3 was operated at identical nitrogen loading but the organic loading was increased to 2 1 g cod l d by addition of sodium acetate 2 3 p d stage ii the effluents from the gsbrs differed in concentrations of nitrites and nitrates and in all three the sum of oxidized nitrogen nox concentrations was high therefore p d was carried out the process was based on the biomass in the gsbr effluent for p d three different external carbon sources were used dr from ethanol production 89 0 6 8 g cod l bod5 cod of 0 5 1 4 g vfa l 6 2 1 1 g tn l 2 8 0 3 g p l gl from biodiesel production 423 0 21 3 g cod l bod5 cod of 0 7 0 g vfa l 0 98 0 07 g tn l 0 23 0 04 g p l and vfas obtained from fermentation of primary sludge in the municipal wastewater treatment plant in olsztyn poland 3180 248 mg cod l bod5 cod of 0 6 880 mg vfa l 73 11 mg tn l 84 8 mg p l for each external organic carbon source the experiments were conducted in duplicate in 30 l covered stirred tanks mixing intensity of 30 rpm for 27 h during this time external carbon sources were added twice after 1 and 5 h of the experiment the corresponding amount of cod was based on the nitrite and nitrate concentrations in the reactor at that time as described in cydzik kwiatkowska et al 6 a dose of external carbon sources provided cod no2 and cod no3 rates of 1 4 and 2 3 respectively the efficiency of nox removal after 27 h in the p d reactors was highest with vfa dosage but not all nox were removed therefore to this p d reactor another two doses of vfas were added after about 30 and 40 h of the experiment the experiment was finished after 52 h 2 4 membrane filtration stage iii the effluent from the p d reactors was the feed for membrane filtration a description of the membrane installation and the ceramic tubular membranes can be found in zielińska and galik 26 in the installation a high pressure pump transported the feed solution throughout the system and ensured cross flow of the permeate through the membrane the filtrations were performed with an initial feed flow velocity of about 15 l min at 21 2 c the permeate was received from the installation and the retentate was constantly circulated back to the feed tank for filtration two membranes that differed in their cut off were used 0 45 μm and 150 kda corresponding to mf and uf respectively mf was conducted at a trans membrane pressure tmp of 0 15 mpa uf at 0 3 mpa each of the series was conducted in duplicate the arithmetic means of the two measurements for each series are presented during the filtration cycle the time necessary for collecting known volumes of permeate was measured these permeation tests were conducted until the membrane was totally clogged and no permeate flow was obtained then the membrane installation was washed according to the producer s instructions the results of the permeation tests were used to calculate the basic hydraulic parameters of the membrane such as permeate flux jv permeate recovery y volumetric concentration factor vcf total membrane resistance rm and the normalized flux α the efficiencies of pollutant removal by mf and uf were expressed as rejection coefficients r for these calculations the same equations were used as in zielińska and galik 26 2 5 analytical methods wastewater and biomass in the reactors were analyzed in accordance with apha 27 the concentration of soluble cod codsol in the feed was measured after filtration by a medium quality filter the oxygen concentration in the reactor was determined using a proodo probe ysi the settling properties of the granular sludge were determined using the sludge volumetric index after 5 and 30 min of sedimentation svi5 svi30 increase in the biomass δx was calculated as the difference between the concentration of the biomass at the end and at the beginning of the experiment turbidity was measured with a nanocolor linus turbidity meter the color was measured with a rayleigh vis 7220 g spectrophotometer as described in 28 for efficiency calculations the technological results obtained during the final 15 cycles of stable gsbr operation were used nitrification efficiency enitr was calculated as the ratio of oxidized nitrogen to total kjeldahl nitrogen less the n used for biomass synthesis expressed as a percentage denitrification eden as the ratio of n reduced to all nox in the reactor also expressed as a percentage during calculation of total nitrogen removal enrem n reduced and n used for biomass synthesis were taken into account in the text abbreviations are used for simplicity the first number in a subscript refers to the reactor the two first letters describe the external carbon source that was used in the p d reactors and the other two letters indicate whether uf or mf was used thus r1 dr mf indicates the system consisting of r1 p d with distillery residue and microfiltration 2 6 statistics for statistical analysis statistica 9 0 software statsoft was used a value of p 0 05 was defined as significant normality was examined using the shapiro wilk test and homogeneity of variance was tested with levene s test if these distributional requirements were satisfied anova was used to test for significance if anova indicated significant differences the tukey hsd test was used for post hoc analysis if the distributional requirements were not satisfied the kruskal wallis test was used the strength of the relationships between groups of the results was determined using pearson s correlation coefficient 3 results and discussion 3 1 gsbrs stage i the biomass concentrations were 7 0 5 0 and 4 5 g mlss l in r1 r2 and r3 respectively and the organic fraction of biomass mlvss made up about 65 of mlss the highest biomass concentration in r1 resulted from the fact that 2 anoxic phases in the reactor cycle favored lower decay of the activated sludge in all gsbrs the svi30 was low about 24 ml g mlss the efficiency of cod removal ecod was over 81 efficient ammonium removal took place and enitr was over 91 table 1sm however the mode of gsbr operation influenced the concentrations of nox in the effluents r1 had two anoxic phases in the cycle and although the effluent from this reactor had the lowest sum of nox it was characterized by the highest no2 no3 ratio that pointed to predominance of partial nitrification in this reactor the denitrification efficiency was highest 45 6 22 5 of all tested gsbr operational conditions better denitrification results in r1 than in r3 indicated that oxic conditions had a greater effect than organic loading on the treatment of digester supernatant the presence of anoxic phases in the working cycle of a gsbr increases the activity of nitrogen converting communities 29 because under variable oxic conditions a diauxic phase occurs in cells of denitrifying bacteria which enables re synthesis of denitrification enzymes and efficient reduction of nox 30 the longer aeration period in r2 and r3 significantly improved the ii phase of nitrification in comparison with r1 the increased organic loading in r3 also ensured the lowest concentrations of soluble and total cod in the effluent both of these improved outcomes may have resulted from the growth of some nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob with special metabolic abilities for example nitrobacter sp both oxidize nitrite from partial denitrification nitrite loop and grow mixotrophically in the presence of acetate ping pong reducing the content of carbon in wastewater the nitrite loop pathway elevates the ratio of nob to ammonium oxidizing bacteria while mixotrophic growth of nitrobacter favors their predominance in the nob population in aerobic granules 31 because there were large quantities of nox in the effluents from the gsbrs from about 126 mg nox l in the effluent from r1 to about 220 mg nox l in that from r2 and the proportion of nitrates and nitrites depended on the mode of operation of the gsbr a p d step was introduced for the biologically treated effluent from all gsbrs 3 2 p d reactor stage ii p d reactor was based on the activity of biomass present in the gsbr effluent therefore it was a simple to operate retention tank and the low biomass concentration in its effluent lowered the solids load on the membrane unit another option is to use p d reactor with a higher mlss excess aerobic granular sludge to increase the rate of denitrification and diminish the volume of p d reactor but then a secondary clarifier must be employed in the treatment line in the effluent from r1 nitrites predominated and the no2 no3 ratio was 2 43 table 1sm during p d of this effluent denitritation denitrification from nitrites predominated and nitrites were removed at rates of 7 8 mg l h 6 6 mg l h and 20 4 mg l h with gl dr and vfa respectively fig 2 the denitritation rates with gl and dr were similar to values observed during denitritation with the use of other complex carbon sources such as starch 32 vfa addition also caused nitrates to be denitrified at a rate of 2 3 mg l h a presence of easily degradable organics limits competition for electron donors between nitrite and nitrate reductases 33 34 that resulted in more effective denitrification of nitrates addition of further doses of all types of organics did not improve nox removal that stopped when the nitrite concentration decreased to about 40 mg l even in the vfa experiments in which two extra doses of vfas were added the high nitrite concentration in the effluent from r1 indicated that the denitrifiers present in the biomass were mostly r strategists microorganisms that grow rapidly on easily available substrates 35 and their activity decreased with decreasing concentrations of nitrites in the p d reactor during p d with the effluent from r2 with an no2 no3 ratio of 0 45 nox was not removed in the first hours of the process with gl and dr i e there was a lag phase the use of gl caused nitrates to be removed only at the end of the experiment while nitrite removal started after 2 h at a rate of 5 8 mg l h fig 3 with dr nitrates were stable at about 165 mg l for 4 h and then after the second dose of dr their concentration started to decrease at a rate of 14 4 mg l h the nitrites concentration decreased at a rate of 8 3 mg l h from the 3rd hour of the experiment with vfa dosage both nitrites and nitrates were removed at rates of 5 8 and 7 9 mg l h respectively which caused 223 mg nox l to be removed at the end of the experiment table 1 bacteria can take up molecules with a low molecular mass such as amino acids vfas or glucose more complex compounds cannot be directly transported across bacterial membranes and a lag phase is necessary for bacteria to produce and excrete enzymes that degrade these polymers into small assimilable molecules the hydrolysis of polymers to monomers may be the rate determining step in the overall removal consumption of organic compounds during biological wastewater treatment in our study a lag phase occurred in all experiments except those with vfas gl contains mostly glycerol which requires enzymatic digestion before integration into cell metabolism 36 the small amounts of methanol that can be present in gl are a more accessible source of carbon but the toxicity of this substance means that it can only be utilized efficiently by a well adapted microbial community 37 dr on the other hand contains a lot of biodegradable compounds but they are mostly in a form of suspended solids and need to be digested before assimilation into bacterial cells in the p d reactors fed with the effluent from r3 in which the nitrate concentration was substantially higher than in the other two gsbrs and the no2 no3 ratio was 0 23 nitrates were removed throughout the entire time of the experiment but the rate of removal depended on the organics used with gl and dr nitrate removal proceeded according to a 1 order reaction with rates 1 7 and 4 1 mg l h respectively whereas with vfas nitrate removal proceeded according to a 0 order reaction at a rate of 2 6 mg l h nitrites were fully removed only with gl fig 4 and vfas when gl was used as an external organics source in p d reactors denitrification ranged from 18 to 26 table 1 and the efficiency of soluble cod removal did not reach any higher than 36 the biomass was not adapted to gl as a carbon source which may explain the relatively low efficiency of nitrogen removal in the p d reactors using dr the denitrification efficiency was highest 22 with the effluent from r3 because nitrites and nitrates were removed whereas only nitrites were removed from r1 the efficiencies of soluble cod removal were higher with dr than with gl ranging from 57 2 in r1 dr to 65 0 in r3 dr this may be due to the fact that the amount of cod used for reduction of nox codrem noxrem was higher with dr than with the other carbon sources ranging from 13 1 19 1 table 1 the fact that microorganisms used this substrate for denitrification was indicated both by the correlation between the total amounts of nox removed and the dose of dr and by the high efficiency of codsol removal because hard to degrade lignocellulosic organic compounds were present in dr relatively high concentrations of cod were still present in the effluent from the p d reactors with doses of vfas that were similar to those in the gl and dr experiments eden and cod removal were higher than with addition of the other carbon sources table 1 additionally in all the vfa experiments the color of the wastewater after p d was not higher than 0 140 which was also better than with the other external carbon sources in r2 vfa to which vfas were added at a dose of 803 mg cod l eden 97 9 and the nox removal rate were highest and the biomass increase was relatively low in r3 vfa which received an increased dose of vfas 1019 mg cod l the assimilation of carbon was also increased for this reason the biomass increase was twice as high as in r2 vfa and a lower amount of carbon was available for denitrification which took place at an efficiency of 92 5 the use of vfas led to the most efficient denitrification at the most favorable low codrem noxrem ratio which ranged from 3 4 to 4 7 table 1 denitrifiers have different affinities for various organic compounds e g they have a low affinity for propionate and prefer butyrate and acetate as substrates 38 elefsiniotis and li 39 used either acetic acid propionic acid or their mixture as an external carbon source for the removal of nitrate present at concentrations of 50 100 and 200 mg l in their experiments a cod n ratio of 2 1 was sufficient for complete denitrification at all temperatures and with all types of carbon investigated a study by li et al 40 indicates that the use of vfas obtained after sludge disintegration requires a much higher cod n ratio of 8 1 to ensure efficient denitrification in the p d experiments with vfas in our study the ratios of external organics to nox were higher than that reported by elefsiniotis and li 39 but lower than that reported by li et al 40 this may be due to the fact that in our study the vfas were a complex mixture of short chain acids and also many types of medium chain acids 880 mg vfa l on the other hand the high percentage of no2 in the present study lowered the overall requirement for organics in comparison with the study of li et al 40 in which nitrates were used as an oxidized form of nitrogen taken together these results indicate that vfas are the most attractive of the tested external carbon sources they have the additional advantage that they can be produced on site via acid phase anaerobic digestion or thermal hydrolysis of sludge therefore minimizing handling and storage problems as well as costs of chemicals 3 3 membrane filtration stage iii in mf of the p d effluents both with gl and dr as carbon sources the cod rejections were the lowest for the effluents from r1 25 2 and 64 9 respectively table 2 the retention coefficients in r1 gl mf and r1 dr mf may have been lowest because in these feeds the share of soluble cod in total cod was very high 88 and 77 therefore the mf membrane could have been too open to retain the particles that constitute soluble cod resulting in a high concentration of cod that passed through the membrane in mf of the effluent from vfa supported p d reactors cod rejection was high from 86 2 91 3 independently of the feed composition although size exclusion is the main mechanism responsible for organic matter removal in mf and uf 41 small molecules such as organic colloids polysaccharides and proteins can be retained completely in uf and partly in mf 42 in addition the higher pressure used in uf increases the rate of water transport through the membrane resulting in lower pollutant concentrations in permeates thus cod rejection can be higher with uf than with mf in the present study this was true for filtration of gl and dr effluents with uf the cod rejection coefficients ranged from 78 2 87 5 with gl and from 81 4 92 1 with dr table 2 due to the lower cut off of the uf membrane these coefficients were higher than those obtained with mf in contrast during filtration of vfa effluents the cod rejection efficiencies were a few percent lower with uf than with mf in all series the rejection of suspended solids was considered complete because turbidity and concentrations of tss in permeates were below the detection limit the highest efficiency of color rejection independently of the membrane used was observed in the feed from p d reactors to which gl was added table 2 this indicates that the color of the feed was caused by particles with high molecular mass that were retained even by mf or that the pollutants responsible for color were adsorbed on organic compounds and then retained by mf in all experimental series the high removal of tss cod color and turbidity in mf and uf could have resulted not only from size exclusion but also from adsorption in the latter mechanism particles are captured inside the membrane structure this phenomenon called fouling means that the nominal diameter of the membrane pores is reduced to the so called effective diameter which makes it possible to reject particles smaller than the membrane cut off 43 this could explain the observation that even in mf cod and color were removed with high efficiency however the intensity of fouling is independent of the type of membrane because sorption is reversible and there are a limited number of sorption sites on the membrane 44 in addition colloids that are captured inside the membrane structure or deposited on the membrane surface may adsorb dissolved organic compounds 45 permeation tests showed that the initial permeate flux was higher with mf fig 2sm than with uf fig 3sm the smaller cut off of the uf membrane caused the jv to be lower in r1 dr uf and r3 vfa uf such a low flux of permeates was observed that cannot be shown in fig 3sm this indicated almost immediate complete blocking of membrane pores with total suspended solids organic colloids polysaccharides and proteins which are the main contributors to membrane fouling 42 in the remaining variants of the present study the flux decreased progressively and became stable until the flow stopped in mf although the initial permeate flux was much higher than in uf the decline in the flux was more rapid reaching 80 in 1 h r2 dr mf fig 2sm according to aouni et al 46 such a rapid flux decline is likely to result from both pore blocking and concentration polarization whereas a slight decline as observed in uf in this study is due to concentration polarization caused by the particles on the membrane surface in general an increase in tmp increases the flux on the other hand however it also causes higher compression of the pollutants on the membrane surface increasing the filtration resistance and decreasing the flux 44 this can explain higher values of rm for uf than for mf table 2sm the average permeation flux of deionized water jw was 37 5 l m2 min for mf and 22 5 l m2 min for uf the permeate flux was much lower than the deionised water flux resulting in very low values of the normalized flux which confirms pore blocking in all of the experimental series although the values of α were close to 0 in all the series which indicates intensive fouling the lower values of α in uf indicate that this membrane tended to become fouled more quickly than the mf membrane independently of the feed composition the intensity of membrane fouling by organic compounds is determined by the difference between the size of the separated particles and the size of the membrane pores fouling is most intensive when these differences are small 47 therefore it can be supposed that the sizes of the particles in the feed were similar to the sizes of the uf membrane pores in the gsbrs the granule diameters ranged from 0 5 to 1 0 mm however during p d they could have become smaller because of shearing forces during mixing with mechanical stirrers and disintegration due to cell lysis these smaller particles could clog the uf membrane by penetrating inside its pores similar penetration inside the pores of the mf membrane could have lowered the effective diameters of the pores resulting in a high efficiency of pollutant rejection table 2 3 4 quality of the effluent after 3 stage treatment in table 2 color and concentrations of cod and nox in all permeates are shown p d with vfas combined with mf or uf produced permeates that met the criteria for wastewater discharge into an aquatic environment 48 the best effluent quality was obtained for the gsbr effluent with no2 no3 ratio of 0 45 that after p d followed by mf was characterized by 36 18 mg cod l and 4 1 0 9 mg tn l these pollutant concentrations were over 3 times lower than those allowed for discharge these permeates also show promise for reuse in irrigation according to the requirements given by bick et al 49 of tss 10 mg l cod 100 mg l conductivity 250 750 mg l total dissolved solids 450 mg l no3 n 5 30 mg l and ph 6 5 8 3 although uf membranes are considered an absolute barrier to all pathogens disinfection might be required before using these permeates for irrigation because falsanisi et al 50 reported a small amount of coliform microbes in municipal wastewater treated with uf the highest treatment efficiency with gl and dr were observed for the gsbr effluent with the highest no2 no3 ratio followed by p d and uf the codeff and noxeff were 80 7 mg l and 69 3 2 8 mg l after the treatment with gl and 54 0 10 0 mg l and 78 8 3 8 mg l after the treatment with dr respectively in general permeates obtained after p d with gl and dr combined with mf or uf had no ammonium low cod concentrations and color no turbidity but high concentrations of nox such effluents can be used as a substrate for the growth of algae either for energetic purposes or as a source of other value added products 51 as stated in studies by dębowski et al 52 effluents of such low cod n ratios as in the present study are promising substrates for intensive cultivation of chlorella sp for the purpose of high production of biomethane 4 conclusions a three stage systems were tested to treat nitrogen rich digester supernatant using waste organic sources to produce reusable wastewater the effluents from the systems which were supported by gl and dr and polished by uf can be reused either as a technological water or as a substrate for the growth of algae either for energetic purposes or a source of bioproducts the system with vfa supported p d and mf produced effluent that met the criteria for wastewater discharge into an aquatic environment or for reuse in irrigation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that there are no

13872,the goal of the study was to treat nitrogen rich digester supernatant for water reuse in a three stage system with an aerobic granular sludge batch reactor gsbr a post denitrification p d reactor and a membrane module in the study the effects on treatment efficiency of organic loading and aeration mode in the gsbr the type of waste organics in p d and the parameters of filtration were investigated denitrification efficiency was highest in the gsbr operated with 2 anoxic phases in the cycle and at 1 8 g cod l d but in this reactor the n no2 n no3 ratio was the highest 2 43 shortening the anoxic period in the cycle and increasing organic loading to 2 1 g cod l d decreased nitrite accumulation in the effluent the n no2 n no3 ratio of 0 23 the effluents with different n no2 n no3 ratios were subjected to p d with glycerin fraction gl distillery residue dr and volatile fatty acids vfas as waste organic sources p d of nitrate rich gsbr effluent with vfa resulted in denitrification efficiency up to 97 9 and followed by microfiltration produced a final stream that could be directly discharged to the environment or used for irrigation the use of p d with gl and dr was most efficient for the treatment of gsbr effluent in which nitrite predominated denitrification efficiencies reached 26 7 with gl and 22 0 with dr after polishing by ultrafiltration the final stream had low cod and color no turbidity high concentrations of nox and could be used for algae growth for bioproduct recovery keywords post denitrification aerobic granules waste glycerin distillery residue volatile fatty acid membrane filtration 1 introduction currently because of the need to lower the consumption of fresh water due to the reduced availability and quality of water resources wastewater reclamation and reuse has gained interest as an environmentally and economically viable option for municipal activities in many developing communities non potable water reuse particularly for agricultural irrigation is gaining popularity 1 the us environmental protection agency 2 suggests guidelines for reuse of water from municipal wastewater treatment plants with a low contribution of industrial wastewater although these guidelines are site specific and use dependent their fulfillment requires advanced methods of wastewater treatment one of the main by products of biological wastewater treatment is anaerobic digester supernatant that contains relatively low cod concentrations and high nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in some wastewater treatment plants this supernatant is treated in the main stream although this additional stream contributes only 2 to the total flow through the plant its nitrogen load is 25 of the total nitrogen load 3 it is advantageous to focus on separate treatment of this small stream with advanced methods instead of treating it in the main stream which would require larger bioreactors and higher energy demands treatment of anaerobic digester supernatant in the side stream in a batch reactor with activated sludge with intermittent aeration phases in the reactor cycle ph regulation and at reduced oxygen concentration did not allow for full ammonium oxidation and denitrification but produced an influent suitable for anammox reactors 50 50 ammonium nitrite 4 on the other hand over 90 efficiency of denitrification of anaerobic digester supernatant was observed by fux et al 5 however it was obtained either in a full scale sbr operated at a long hydraulic retention time sludge age and with an addition of pure organics such as ethanol and methanol to support denitrification or in a continuous flow sharon reactor but at a total hrt greater than 4 days and at 29 c application of pure organics long hydraulic retention times and high temperature decreased the economical attractiveness of these process separate treatment of the supernatant can be performed in systems with aerobic granular sludge batch reactors gsbrs which enables efficient removal of ammonium but produces effluent with a high concentration of oxidized nitrogen 6 to remove nitrate and nitrite anoxic phases can be introduced to the gsbr cycle 7 or a second purification step that only targets denitrification of oxidized nitrogen forms can be added the gsbr effluent usually contains high concentrations of total solids because all slow settling biomass must be removed for effective granulation the presence of biomass in purified effluents worsens their quality but can be advantageous if the activity of biomass will be used for further biological treatment of wastewater because the metabolic pathways are distinct between different systems depending on their microbial composition the optimal cod n ratio for a biological denitrification system for treating a specific wastewater must be determined experimentally 8 the selection of a carbon source should take into account its cost and content of adverse toxic compounds the degree to which it can be degraded the resulting denitrification rate process kinetics and production of sludge and whether full denitrification will be possible without biomass adaptation 9 although short chain compounds such as methanol ethanol or acetate have advantages as carbon sources for denitrification 10 they are expensive so it is preferable to use waste carbon sources one potential carbon source is distillery residue dr it is a by product of ethyl alcohol production from substrates that are rich in simple and complex sugars this waste has a high content of easily biodegradable organic substances although most of them are in a form of suspended solids 11 another potential carbon source is waste glycerin fraction gl which is a by product of rapeseed oil methanolysis for biodiesel production gl contains 30 40 glycerol up to 50 soaps and emulsified methyl esters and the rest is methanol and water 12 an attractive carbon source is short chain volatile fatty acids vfas in wastewater treatment systems vfas are released during the hydrolysis of primary sludge in the fermenter 13 and then introduced into the biological part of the wastewater treatment plant i e to denitrification or dephosphatation tanks for wastewater reclamation and reuse membrane separation is the most promising solution 14 for reducing suspended solids and cod low pressure techniques i e microfiltration mf and ultrafiltration uf are used because they are more economical than the other processes due to their high flux with a low energy input 15 mf and uf can be employed in a combination of physical chemical and biological processes in two treatment options i in membrane bioreactor mbr technology that integrates biological treatment with mf or uf or ii as a post treatment for tertiary treatment of municipal wastewater to achieve high effluent quality 16 the first option mbr has many advantages such as excellent effluent quality and a small footprint however mbrs have been used mainly for treatment of municipal wastewater with low concentrations of nitrogen 40 mg tn l where the influent was split into an aerobic tank and an anoxic tank 17 reports on the use of mbrs for treatment of digester supernatant are scarce for effective denitrification in these cases pure carbon sources such as methanol or acetic acids have been used 18 in a water stressed developing community the second option post treatment was preferred for non potable water reuse because it is less costly than the first 19 permeates from biological treatment and mf or uf have been directly reused for irrigation 20 recirculated to the system as a technological water 21 22 or used for recreational purposes after removal of residual color 23 ceramic membranes are more resistant to both corrosive chemicals and extremes of ph and temperature than most commonly used polymeric membranes 24 ceramic membranes are highly porous and strongly hydrophilic therefore they can reach much higher flux than polymer membranes because of weaker bonding between foulants and the membrane material 25 tubular ceramic membranes are particularly suitable in applications where the feed solution contains a relatively high proportion of large particles thus although polymeric membranes have lower initial costs ceramic membranes are worth investigating because their advantages make them more competitive with polymeric membranes over the long term the objective of the study was to optimize an operation of a three stage system consisting of a gsbr post denitrification p d reactor and membrane filtration for treatment of a nitrogen rich digester supernatant for water reuse the innovative strategy was to add to the gsbr membrane system a p d step which was supported by organic wastes and carried out by the biomass present in the gsbr effluent such an approach changed the high concentrations of suspended solids in gsbr effluent into an advantage in the study low pressure membrane techniques using ceramic membranes with different cut off levels were applied the proposed technological solution is in line with the assumptions of a modern circular economy which requires both the development of technological solutions that will produce high quality reusable effluent via efficient treatment of wastewater and the utilization of wastes especially those from the agro food sector 2 materials and methods the organization of the experiment is presented in fig 1 in the present study to ensure efficient nitrification in the gsbrs a three stage system was used fig 1sm the effluents from the gsbrs contained about 0 45 0 50 g mlss l and this biomass reduced nox in the p d reactors the maintenance of a low concentration of biomass in the p d reactors had two main advantages first the reactor was a simple to operate retention tank that did not require biomass monitoring and recirculation or sludge age monitoring second the low biomass concentration lowers the solids load on the membrane unit which decreases the frequency of membrane washing 2 1 substrate anaerobic digester supernatant was obtained from the municipal wastewater treatment plant in olsztyn poland the concentrations of pollutants were about 1024 9 13 7 mg cod l 443 9 51 9 mg tn l 377 6 42 5 mg n nh4 l and 261 0 94 1 mg p l to ensure nitrification in gsbrs carbonates and bicarbonates were added to the supernatant in theoretical amounts 2 2 gsbrs stage i the experiment was conducted in three column gsbrs with a working volume of 4 l and a height to diameter ratio of 10 the reactors were operated by programmable logic controllers at a volumetric exchange rate of 67 and a temperature of 26 c air was supplied via aeration grids in the bottom of the gsbrs with a superficial air velocity of 0 8 cm s the concentration of free dissolved oxygen was at a level of 1 mg l during the first 3 4 hours of the cycle until the ammonium was oxidized and increased to 5 6 mg l at the end of the cycle the reactors were seeded with aerobic granular sludge cultivated with digester supernatant during a previous experiment 7 the sludge retention time in all gsbrs was at a level of 6 days all gsbrs were operated with an 8 h cycle resulting in a hydraulic retention time of 12 h filling settling and decantation each lasted for 5 min the first reactor r1 was operated at nitrogen and organic loadings of 0 8 g tn l d and 1 8 g cod l d respectively and with two 1 h anoxic phases in the cycle at the beginning and after 4 5 h of the cycle the second reactor r2 was operated at identical nitrogen and organic loadings but with only one 1 h anoxic phase at the beginning of the cycle the third reactor r3 was operated at identical nitrogen loading but the organic loading was increased to 2 1 g cod l d by addition of sodium acetate 2 3 p d stage ii the effluents from the gsbrs differed in concentrations of nitrites and nitrates and in all three the sum of oxidized nitrogen nox concentrations was high therefore p d was carried out the process was based on the biomass in the gsbr effluent for p d three different external carbon sources were used dr from ethanol production 89 0 6 8 g cod l bod5 cod of 0 5 1 4 g vfa l 6 2 1 1 g tn l 2 8 0 3 g p l gl from biodiesel production 423 0 21 3 g cod l bod5 cod of 0 7 0 g vfa l 0 98 0 07 g tn l 0 23 0 04 g p l and vfas obtained from fermentation of primary sludge in the municipal wastewater treatment plant in olsztyn poland 3180 248 mg cod l bod5 cod of 0 6 880 mg vfa l 73 11 mg tn l 84 8 mg p l for each external organic carbon source the experiments were conducted in duplicate in 30 l covered stirred tanks mixing intensity of 30 rpm for 27 h during this time external carbon sources were added twice after 1 and 5 h of the experiment the corresponding amount of cod was based on the nitrite and nitrate concentrations in the reactor at that time as described in cydzik kwiatkowska et al 6 a dose of external carbon sources provided cod no2 and cod no3 rates of 1 4 and 2 3 respectively the efficiency of nox removal after 27 h in the p d reactors was highest with vfa dosage but not all nox were removed therefore to this p d reactor another two doses of vfas were added after about 30 and 40 h of the experiment the experiment was finished after 52 h 2 4 membrane filtration stage iii the effluent from the p d reactors was the feed for membrane filtration a description of the membrane installation and the ceramic tubular membranes can be found in zielińska and galik 26 in the installation a high pressure pump transported the feed solution throughout the system and ensured cross flow of the permeate through the membrane the filtrations were performed with an initial feed flow velocity of about 15 l min at 21 2 c the permeate was received from the installation and the retentate was constantly circulated back to the feed tank for filtration two membranes that differed in their cut off were used 0 45 μm and 150 kda corresponding to mf and uf respectively mf was conducted at a trans membrane pressure tmp of 0 15 mpa uf at 0 3 mpa each of the series was conducted in duplicate the arithmetic means of the two measurements for each series are presented during the filtration cycle the time necessary for collecting known volumes of permeate was measured these permeation tests were conducted until the membrane was totally clogged and no permeate flow was obtained then the membrane installation was washed according to the producer s instructions the results of the permeation tests were used to calculate the basic hydraulic parameters of the membrane such as permeate flux jv permeate recovery y volumetric concentration factor vcf total membrane resistance rm and the normalized flux α the efficiencies of pollutant removal by mf and uf were expressed as rejection coefficients r for these calculations the same equations were used as in zielińska and galik 26 2 5 analytical methods wastewater and biomass in the reactors were analyzed in accordance with apha 27 the concentration of soluble cod codsol in the feed was measured after filtration by a medium quality filter the oxygen concentration in the reactor was determined using a proodo probe ysi the settling properties of the granular sludge were determined using the sludge volumetric index after 5 and 30 min of sedimentation svi5 svi30 increase in the biomass δx was calculated as the difference between the concentration of the biomass at the end and at the beginning of the experiment turbidity was measured with a nanocolor linus turbidity meter the color was measured with a rayleigh vis 7220 g spectrophotometer as described in 28 for efficiency calculations the technological results obtained during the final 15 cycles of stable gsbr operation were used nitrification efficiency enitr was calculated as the ratio of oxidized nitrogen to total kjeldahl nitrogen less the n used for biomass synthesis expressed as a percentage denitrification eden as the ratio of n reduced to all nox in the reactor also expressed as a percentage during calculation of total nitrogen removal enrem n reduced and n used for biomass synthesis were taken into account in the text abbreviations are used for simplicity the first number in a subscript refers to the reactor the two first letters describe the external carbon source that was used in the p d reactors and the other two letters indicate whether uf or mf was used thus r1 dr mf indicates the system consisting of r1 p d with distillery residue and microfiltration 2 6 statistics for statistical analysis statistica 9 0 software statsoft was used a value of p 0 05 was defined as significant normality was examined using the shapiro wilk test and homogeneity of variance was tested with levene s test if these distributional requirements were satisfied anova was used to test for significance if anova indicated significant differences the tukey hsd test was used for post hoc analysis if the distributional requirements were not satisfied the kruskal wallis test was used the strength of the relationships between groups of the results was determined using pearson s correlation coefficient 3 results and discussion 3 1 gsbrs stage i the biomass concentrations were 7 0 5 0 and 4 5 g mlss l in r1 r2 and r3 respectively and the organic fraction of biomass mlvss made up about 65 of mlss the highest biomass concentration in r1 resulted from the fact that 2 anoxic phases in the reactor cycle favored lower decay of the activated sludge in all gsbrs the svi30 was low about 24 ml g mlss the efficiency of cod removal ecod was over 81 efficient ammonium removal took place and enitr was over 91 table 1sm however the mode of gsbr operation influenced the concentrations of nox in the effluents r1 had two anoxic phases in the cycle and although the effluent from this reactor had the lowest sum of nox it was characterized by the highest no2 no3 ratio that pointed to predominance of partial nitrification in this reactor the denitrification efficiency was highest 45 6 22 5 of all tested gsbr operational conditions better denitrification results in r1 than in r3 indicated that oxic conditions had a greater effect than organic loading on the treatment of digester supernatant the presence of anoxic phases in the working cycle of a gsbr increases the activity of nitrogen converting communities 29 because under variable oxic conditions a diauxic phase occurs in cells of denitrifying bacteria which enables re synthesis of denitrification enzymes and efficient reduction of nox 30 the longer aeration period in r2 and r3 significantly improved the ii phase of nitrification in comparison with r1 the increased organic loading in r3 also ensured the lowest concentrations of soluble and total cod in the effluent both of these improved outcomes may have resulted from the growth of some nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob with special metabolic abilities for example nitrobacter sp both oxidize nitrite from partial denitrification nitrite loop and grow mixotrophically in the presence of acetate ping pong reducing the content of carbon in wastewater the nitrite loop pathway elevates the ratio of nob to ammonium oxidizing bacteria while mixotrophic growth of nitrobacter favors their predominance in the nob population in aerobic granules 31 because there were large quantities of nox in the effluents from the gsbrs from about 126 mg nox l in the effluent from r1 to about 220 mg nox l in that from r2 and the proportion of nitrates and nitrites depended on the mode of operation of the gsbr a p d step was introduced for the biologically treated effluent from all gsbrs 3 2 p d reactor stage ii p d reactor was based on the activity of biomass present in the gsbr effluent therefore it was a simple to operate retention tank and the low biomass concentration in its effluent lowered the solids load on the membrane unit another option is to use p d reactor with a higher mlss excess aerobic granular sludge to increase the rate of denitrification and diminish the volume of p d reactor but then a secondary clarifier must be employed in the treatment line in the effluent from r1 nitrites predominated and the no2 no3 ratio was 2 43 table 1sm during p d of this effluent denitritation denitrification from nitrites predominated and nitrites were removed at rates of 7 8 mg l h 6 6 mg l h and 20 4 mg l h with gl dr and vfa respectively fig 2 the denitritation rates with gl and dr were similar to values observed during denitritation with the use of other complex carbon sources such as starch 32 vfa addition also caused nitrates to be denitrified at a rate of 2 3 mg l h a presence of easily degradable organics limits competition for electron donors between nitrite and nitrate reductases 33 34 that resulted in more effective denitrification of nitrates addition of further doses of all types of organics did not improve nox removal that stopped when the nitrite concentration decreased to about 40 mg l even in the vfa experiments in which two extra doses of vfas were added the high nitrite concentration in the effluent from r1 indicated that the denitrifiers present in the biomass were mostly r strategists microorganisms that grow rapidly on easily available substrates 35 and their activity decreased with decreasing concentrations of nitrites in the p d reactor during p d with the effluent from r2 with an no2 no3 ratio of 0 45 nox was not removed in the first hours of the process with gl and dr i e there was a lag phase the use of gl caused nitrates to be removed only at the end of the experiment while nitrite removal started after 2 h at a rate of 5 8 mg l h fig 3 with dr nitrates were stable at about 165 mg l for 4 h and then after the second dose of dr their concentration started to decrease at a rate of 14 4 mg l h the nitrites concentration decreased at a rate of 8 3 mg l h from the 3rd hour of the experiment with vfa dosage both nitrites and nitrates were removed at rates of 5 8 and 7 9 mg l h respectively which caused 223 mg nox l to be removed at the end of the experiment table 1 bacteria can take up molecules with a low molecular mass such as amino acids vfas or glucose more complex compounds cannot be directly transported across bacterial membranes and a lag phase is necessary for bacteria to produce and excrete enzymes that degrade these polymers into small assimilable molecules the hydrolysis of polymers to monomers may be the rate determining step in the overall removal consumption of organic compounds during biological wastewater treatment in our study a lag phase occurred in all experiments except those with vfas gl contains mostly glycerol which requires enzymatic digestion before integration into cell metabolism 36 the small amounts of methanol that can be present in gl are a more accessible source of carbon but the toxicity of this substance means that it can only be utilized efficiently by a well adapted microbial community 37 dr on the other hand contains a lot of biodegradable compounds but they are mostly in a form of suspended solids and need to be digested before assimilation into bacterial cells in the p d reactors fed with the effluent from r3 in which the nitrate concentration was substantially higher than in the other two gsbrs and the no2 no3 ratio was 0 23 nitrates were removed throughout the entire time of the experiment but the rate of removal depended on the organics used with gl and dr nitrate removal proceeded according to a 1 order reaction with rates 1 7 and 4 1 mg l h respectively whereas with vfas nitrate removal proceeded according to a 0 order reaction at a rate of 2 6 mg l h nitrites were fully removed only with gl fig 4 and vfas when gl was used as an external organics source in p d reactors denitrification ranged from 18 to 26 table 1 and the efficiency of soluble cod removal did not reach any higher than 36 the biomass was not adapted to gl as a carbon source which may explain the relatively low efficiency of nitrogen removal in the p d reactors using dr the denitrification efficiency was highest 22 with the effluent from r3 because nitrites and nitrates were removed whereas only nitrites were removed from r1 the efficiencies of soluble cod removal were higher with dr than with gl ranging from 57 2 in r1 dr to 65 0 in r3 dr this may be due to the fact that the amount of cod used for reduction of nox codrem noxrem was higher with dr than with the other carbon sources ranging from 13 1 19 1 table 1 the fact that microorganisms used this substrate for denitrification was indicated both by the correlation between the total amounts of nox removed and the dose of dr and by the high efficiency of codsol removal because hard to degrade lignocellulosic organic compounds were present in dr relatively high concentrations of cod were still present in the effluent from the p d reactors with doses of vfas that were similar to those in the gl and dr experiments eden and cod removal were higher than with addition of the other carbon sources table 1 additionally in all the vfa experiments the color of the wastewater after p d was not higher than 0 140 which was also better than with the other external carbon sources in r2 vfa to which vfas were added at a dose of 803 mg cod l eden 97 9 and the nox removal rate were highest and the biomass increase was relatively low in r3 vfa which received an increased dose of vfas 1019 mg cod l the assimilation of carbon was also increased for this reason the biomass increase was twice as high as in r2 vfa and a lower amount of carbon was available for denitrification which took place at an efficiency of 92 5 the use of vfas led to the most efficient denitrification at the most favorable low codrem noxrem ratio which ranged from 3 4 to 4 7 table 1 denitrifiers have different affinities for various organic compounds e g they have a low affinity for propionate and prefer butyrate and acetate as substrates 38 elefsiniotis and li 39 used either acetic acid propionic acid or their mixture as an external carbon source for the removal of nitrate present at concentrations of 50 100 and 200 mg l in their experiments a cod n ratio of 2 1 was sufficient for complete denitrification at all temperatures and with all types of carbon investigated a study by li et al 40 indicates that the use of vfas obtained after sludge disintegration requires a much higher cod n ratio of 8 1 to ensure efficient denitrification in the p d experiments with vfas in our study the ratios of external organics to nox were higher than that reported by elefsiniotis and li 39 but lower than that reported by li et al 40 this may be due to the fact that in our study the vfas were a complex mixture of short chain acids and also many types of medium chain acids 880 mg vfa l on the other hand the high percentage of no2 in the present study lowered the overall requirement for organics in comparison with the study of li et al 40 in which nitrates were used as an oxidized form of nitrogen taken together these results indicate that vfas are the most attractive of the tested external carbon sources they have the additional advantage that they can be produced on site via acid phase anaerobic digestion or thermal hydrolysis of sludge therefore minimizing handling and storage problems as well as costs of chemicals 3 3 membrane filtration stage iii in mf of the p d effluents both with gl and dr as carbon sources the cod rejections were the lowest for the effluents from r1 25 2 and 64 9 respectively table 2 the retention coefficients in r1 gl mf and r1 dr mf may have been lowest because in these feeds the share of soluble cod in total cod was very high 88 and 77 therefore the mf membrane could have been too open to retain the particles that constitute soluble cod resulting in a high concentration of cod that passed through the membrane in mf of the effluent from vfa supported p d reactors cod rejection was high from 86 2 91 3 independently of the feed composition although size exclusion is the main mechanism responsible for organic matter removal in mf and uf 41 small molecules such as organic colloids polysaccharides and proteins can be retained completely in uf and partly in mf 42 in addition the higher pressure used in uf increases the rate of water transport through the membrane resulting in lower pollutant concentrations in permeates thus cod rejection can be higher with uf than with mf in the present study this was true for filtration of gl and dr effluents with uf the cod rejection coefficients ranged from 78 2 87 5 with gl and from 81 4 92 1 with dr table 2 due to the lower cut off of the uf membrane these coefficients were higher than those obtained with mf in contrast during filtration of vfa effluents the cod rejection efficiencies were a few percent lower with uf than with mf in all series the rejection of suspended solids was considered complete because turbidity and concentrations of tss in permeates were below the detection limit the highest efficiency of color rejection independently of the membrane used was observed in the feed from p d reactors to which gl was added table 2 this indicates that the color of the feed was caused by particles with high molecular mass that were retained even by mf or that the pollutants responsible for color were adsorbed on organic compounds and then retained by mf in all experimental series the high removal of tss cod color and turbidity in mf and uf could have resulted not only from size exclusion but also from adsorption in the latter mechanism particles are captured inside the membrane structure this phenomenon called fouling means that the nominal diameter of the membrane pores is reduced to the so called effective diameter which makes it possible to reject particles smaller than the membrane cut off 43 this could explain the observation that even in mf cod and color were removed with high efficiency however the intensity of fouling is independent of the type of membrane because sorption is reversible and there are a limited number of sorption sites on the membrane 44 in addition colloids that are captured inside the membrane structure or deposited on the membrane surface may adsorb dissolved organic compounds 45 permeation tests showed that the initial permeate flux was higher with mf fig 2sm than with uf fig 3sm the smaller cut off of the uf membrane caused the jv to be lower in r1 dr uf and r3 vfa uf such a low flux of permeates was observed that cannot be shown in fig 3sm this indicated almost immediate complete blocking of membrane pores with total suspended solids organic colloids polysaccharides and proteins which are the main contributors to membrane fouling 42 in the remaining variants of the present study the flux decreased progressively and became stable until the flow stopped in mf although the initial permeate flux was much higher than in uf the decline in the flux was more rapid reaching 80 in 1 h r2 dr mf fig 2sm according to aouni et al 46 such a rapid flux decline is likely to result from both pore blocking and concentration polarization whereas a slight decline as observed in uf in this study is due to concentration polarization caused by the particles on the membrane surface in general an increase in tmp increases the flux on the other hand however it also causes higher compression of the pollutants on the membrane surface increasing the filtration resistance and decreasing the flux 44 this can explain higher values of rm for uf than for mf table 2sm the average permeation flux of deionized water jw was 37 5 l m2 min for mf and 22 5 l m2 min for uf the permeate flux was much lower than the deionised water flux resulting in very low values of the normalized flux which confirms pore blocking in all of the experimental series although the values of α were close to 0 in all the series which indicates intensive fouling the lower values of α in uf indicate that this membrane tended to become fouled more quickly than the mf membrane independently of the feed composition the intensity of membrane fouling by organic compounds is determined by the difference between the size of the separated particles and the size of the membrane pores fouling is most intensive when these differences are small 47 therefore it can be supposed that the sizes of the particles in the feed were similar to the sizes of the uf membrane pores in the gsbrs the granule diameters ranged from 0 5 to 1 0 mm however during p d they could have become smaller because of shearing forces during mixing with mechanical stirrers and disintegration due to cell lysis these smaller particles could clog the uf membrane by penetrating inside its pores similar penetration inside the pores of the mf membrane could have lowered the effective diameters of the pores resulting in a high efficiency of pollutant rejection table 2 3 4 quality of the effluent after 3 stage treatment in table 2 color and concentrations of cod and nox in all permeates are shown p d with vfas combined with mf or uf produced permeates that met the criteria for wastewater discharge into an aquatic environment 48 the best effluent quality was obtained for the gsbr effluent with no2 no3 ratio of 0 45 that after p d followed by mf was characterized by 36 18 mg cod l and 4 1 0 9 mg tn l these pollutant concentrations were over 3 times lower than those allowed for discharge these permeates also show promise for reuse in irrigation according to the requirements given by bick et al 49 of tss 10 mg l cod 100 mg l conductivity 250 750 mg l total dissolved solids 450 mg l no3 n 5 30 mg l and ph 6 5 8 3 although uf membranes are considered an absolute barrier to all pathogens disinfection might be required before using these permeates for irrigation because falsanisi et al 50 reported a small amount of coliform microbes in municipal wastewater treated with uf the highest treatment efficiency with gl and dr were observed for the gsbr effluent with the highest no2 no3 ratio followed by p d and uf the codeff and noxeff were 80 7 mg l and 69 3 2 8 mg l after the treatment with gl and 54 0 10 0 mg l and 78 8 3 8 mg l after the treatment with dr respectively in general permeates obtained after p d with gl and dr combined with mf or uf had no ammonium low cod concentrations and color no turbidity but high concentrations of nox such effluents can be used as a substrate for the growth of algae either for energetic purposes or as a source of other value added products 51 as stated in studies by dębowski et al 52 effluents of such low cod n ratios as in the present study are promising substrates for intensive cultivation of chlorella sp for the purpose of high production of biomethane 4 conclusions a three stage systems were tested to treat nitrogen rich digester supernatant using waste organic sources to produce reusable wastewater the effluents from the systems which were supported by gl and dr and polished by uf can be reused either as a technological water or as a substrate for the growth of algae either for energetic purposes or a source of bioproducts the system with vfa supported p d and mf produced effluent that met the criteria for wastewater discharge into an aquatic environment or for reuse in irrigation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that there are no

13873,improving the nitrogen removal capacity of stormwater runoff has been the main research direction of bioretention systems in recent years heterotrophic denitrification in traditional bioretention systems was often used but insufficient carbon sources in the runoff limit it in this study two bioretention systems using natural pyrite and zeolite as substrates were constructed to explore the feasibility of pyrite based autotrophic denitrification in bioretention for nitrogen removal during eight months of operation at natural conditions the results showed that pyrite had no negative effects on the removal of nh4 n but enhanced denitrification in the bioretention system with no or low carbon source in the influent pyrite based bioretention system pbs can adapt to low temperature and irregular wet and dry alternation the average nh4 n tn and tp removal efficiency of pbs during eight months were 87 6 89 3 and 81 6 the average nh4 n tn and tp removal efficiency of zeolite based bioretention system zbs were 98 7 47 1 and 47 5 by products s o 4 2 and total iron of pbs were all at an acceptable level the dominant genera in pbs were denitratisoma 3 6 ellin6067 2 7 thiobacillus 2 6 thauera 2 1 cl500 29 marine group 1 8 sulfuritalea 1 7 subgroup 10 1 4 genera thiobacillus thauera and sulfuritalea were highly related to autotrophic denitrification moreover genera denitratisoma was highly related to heterotrophic denitrification this study shows that pyrite could be a promising eco friendly substrate in the bioretention system for nutrient removal keywords pyrite bioretention system stormwater runoff low impact development denitrification 1 introduction the large scale construction of urban drainage networks and municipal sewage treatment plants has reduced urban point source pollution and non point source pollution has become a significant cause of water pollution 1 measures such as green roofs 2 and constructed wetlands 3 have been studied to treat non point source pollution compared to them bioretention systems are more convenient as one of the most common methods of low impact development the bioretention system bs has a pivotal role in urban stormwater runoff control under different conditions due to its flexibility and availability the design of bs combines the principles of hydraulic flow with physical chemical and biological processes to improve water quality 4 extensive researches have shown that bs can reduce not only flood volumes and stormwater peak flow 5 but also has an excellent performance in removing suspended solids phosphorus p organic matter and heavy metals 6 8 however the removal efficiency of bs for nitrogen n was still limited and fluctuant results from several studies suggest that the removal of n in bss varies greatly 6 9 10 generally bss remove n in stormwater through microbial processes about nitrification for ammonia and denitrification for nitrite and nitrate 11 12 ammonia nitrogen nh4 n control is easy to achieve many results have highlighted the high nh4 n removal in bs 10 13 however compared with the high nh4 n removal the nitrate no3 n removal was not good therefore in recent years many studies mainly focused on the enhancement of denitrification for nitrate removal some enhancement modification such as establishing anoxic conditions usually establishing submerged zone or providing electron donors e g some form of organic carbon to increase no3 n removal 14 17 but the problem of organic matter aging leading to reduced nitrogen removal efficiency also occurred in recent years sulfur based autotrophic denitrification which uses sulfur as an electron donor has attracted many researchers and some of their results showed high nitrogen removal efficiency in the laboratory scale 18 19 this process is well suited for the denitrification of low carbon source wastewater because it does not require additional carbon sources and produces less sludge 20 21 however the extensive use of sulfur in engineering applications adds cost and is not durable pyrite fes2 is one of the most abundant sulfides in the earth s crust 22 studies have shown that pyrite and its derivatives can be used as an electron donor to reduce no3 n to n2 23 24 fe2 and fe3 are also useful for phosphate po4 3 removal 25 26 moreover some recent researches indicate that fe fe ii or fe 0 could support autotrophic denitrification to be a promising process for low carbon water treatment 27 28 most studies were focused on low c n wastewater or groundwater treatment there was little researches focused on the feasibility of the pyrite based denitrification in stormwater treatment a long term study had proven that the use of pyrite as substrates in a constructed wetland which was closest to bioretention could efficiently and stably remove nitrogen and phosphorus for a long time 29 the latest study investigated the performance of a pyrite based constructed wetland microbial fuel cell in nitrate and total phosphorus removal and gained a high removal rate 30 moreover a constructed wetland based pyrrhotite had an excellent performance to remove the glyphosate and nutrients from simulated agriculture runoff 31 these studies show that pyrite has a strong potential in the lid project however the bs still has many differences with the constructed wetland such as its random dry wet alternating characteristics which are entirely dependent on meteorological conditions and its heavily fluctuant flow rate unlike ecosystems connected to water bodies nitrogen migration in bss was only driven by short term stormwater runoff 11 32 12 therefore it is unreasonable to simply use the existing research results and conclusions to judge the application of pyrite in bs to our knowledge there were few reports on the pyrite based bioretention system so in this study a column scaled bs was constructed using pyrite as the substrates and traditional matrix as comparison and operate at the outdoor condition for 8 months this study aimed to 1 explore the feasibility and performance of nutrient removal by using pyrite as the substrates in bs for no carbon source or low carbon source stormwater runoff treatment 2 evaluate the by product of pyrite based bs in alternating climate condition and 3 prove the potential existence of microorganism such as thiobacillus which could use pyrite as an electron donor for autotrophic denitrification the result of this study could provide a new prospect for nutrient removal and eutrophication control of stormwater 2 materials and methods 2 1 simulated biological retention system device two simulated bioretention systems zeolite bioretention system zbs and pyrite bioretention system pbs located in the outdoor condition with rain cover were both constructed with acrylic material with the same configuration φ300 mm h1300 mm the structure of the device and the distribution of each layer of filler were shown in fig 1 the water storage area h200 mm and the overburden h400 mm at the top of the structure simulated the real bioretention system the bottom layer made of pebbles h50 mm mainly played a load bearing and drainage role ceramsite h150 mm quartz sand h100 mm and gravel h100 mm were primarily used to remove suspended solids over the bottom layer a 400 mm submerged zone was created by the outflow elevation of the drainage pipe using 90 elbows the substrate layer in the submerged zone of the pbs was pyrite and that in the zbs was zeolite the zbs was used as a comparison group for pbs to investigate changes of water quality in submerged substrate layer and extract microorganisms on the filler of the two bss an outlet with valve ② in fig 1 and a screwable seal ① in fig 1 was mounted vertically outside the substrate layer water and filler samples were able to be collected from them 2 2 substrates pyrite was obtained from shangbao hunan province china and zeolite was obtained from zhengzhou henan province china the particle size of pyrite and zeolite were between 5 and 7 mm the purity of pyrite used in this study was about 90 the overburden matrix consisted of weathered rock sand 75 volume mixed with local soil 25 volume the particle size of the quartz sand was between 1 and 2 mm the particle sizes of gravel and ceramsite were between 10 and 15 mm the particle size of pebble was between 10 and 20 mm 2 3 operation sampling and analysis before starting the experiment two assembled bss were rinsed with water for two weeks to remove the filler s inherent nutrients since then the simulated stormwater runoff was prepared with the tap water that has been placed for a day to remove residual chlorine nh4cl kno3 and kh2po4 were used to simulate influent nh4 n and no3 n and tp total phosphorus after six months of operation acetate was added as the carbon source to the influent and other constituents remained unchanged referring to the local stormwater runoff pollutant concentration nh4 n was 5 8 mg no3 n was 6 12 mg tp was 0 5 1 1 mg cod chemical oxygen demand was about 20 mg in the earliest two months hrt hydraulic retention time was 3 days in the next months the majority of hrt was 3 days and the remaining hrt was 6 days influent and effluent were collected every hrt the substrate layer s water samples were collected after 2 h 6 h 12 h 24 h 48 h 72 h 96 h 120 h 144 h of influent in 6 days hrt water samples were filtered through 0 45 μm filters before analysis nh4 n no3 n no2 n nitrite tn total nitrogen tp were analyzed using a spectrophotometer a uv vis spectrophotometer hach dr6000 usa so4 2 sulfate was analyzed using an ion chromatograph ics 600 ion chromatography system dionex america total iron fe was analyzed using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer aa6800fg shimadzu japan temperature and ph values were measured using a ph meter hq30d hach usa 2 4 microbial community analysis when cod was added to the influent and ran for two months substrate samples were collected for microbial community analyses genomic dna extraction from fillers referred to li et al 21 total microbial genomic dna samples were extracted using the dneasy powersoil kit qiagen inc netherlands following the manufacturer s instructions and stored at 20 c before further analysis the quantity and quality of extracted dnas were measured using a nanodrop nd 1000 spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa and agarose gel electrophoresis then pcr was conducted and high throughput sequencing was finished on an illumina miseq platform with miseq reagent kit v3 at shanghai personal biotechnology co ltd shanghai china the used primer in pcr amplification was 338 f 5 actcctacgggaggcagcag 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 3 results 3 1 variation of ph in the effluent fig 2 shows the ph of the effluent from the two bss during the experiment in the first month of the operation the effluent of pbs was acidic in the following months the ph of the effluent from pbs increased steadily then became stable which was still about 0 1 lower than that of zbs the ph of zbs effluent was always relatively stable throughout the entire experiment after adding 20 mg l cod to the influent the effluent ph values of the two bss were close there was not only autotrophic denitrification but also heterotrophic denitrification existed in pbs refer to 3 4 microbial communities therefore after adding organic matter autotrophic denitrification consumed alkalinity and heterotrophic denitrification produced alkalinity the alkalinity produced by the two types of denitrification counterweighed increasing in the ph of pbs although there was mainly heterotrophic denitrification in zbs the denitrification efficiency of zbs was still low after adding cod so its ph does not change much it was the reason why the ph difference between the two bss was small 3 2 performances of nh4 n tn and tp removal for the two bss nh4 n removal was stable while tn and tp removals showed different performance during the experimental process fig 3 during the 8 months the average influent nh4 n was 6 2 0 5 mg l mean s d respectively and accordingly nh4 n removal was 98 7 0 2 for zbs and 87 6 4 9 for pbs fig 3a in the last two months the addition of cod in the influent did not affect nh4 n removal of the two bss numerous studies have shown that most bss have an nh4 n removal of over 70 4 9 fig 3b shows that the tn removal of pbs was relatively stable seasonal changes and the addition of cod in the influent could slightly enhance the effect of pbs while there were fluctuations in tn removal of zbs during the 8 months the average influent tn was 15 5 0 8 mg l respectively and tn removals were 89 3 3 0 for pbs and 47 1 19 0 for zbs fig 3b in the first month the gap in pbs and zbs tn removals was small in the next five months the average tn removal of pbs was much higher than that of zbs even if cod was added to the influent in the last two months the tn removal difference between the two bss was also very pronounced in some previous researches topsoil compost wood chips sand gravel and other materials were used for bss and their tn removal rate was 59 8 92 9 33 36 during the 8 months the average influent tp was 0 8 0 1 mg l respectively and accordingly tp removal was 47 5 15 1 for zbs and 81 6 4 0 for pbs fig 3c tp removal of pbs was as stable as tn zbs s tp removal effect deteriorates with time even if cod was added to the influent in the last two months it is only slightly improved the tp removal of bs was a big difference in many types of research and even the concentration of effluent was higher than that of influent in some studies 7 3 3 changes of no3 n and no2 n in the substrate layer in the 6 months of this experiment collecting water samples from the outlet of the bottom matrix layer and analyzing no3 n and no2 n to study their changes in the substrate layer as shown in fig 4 the removal effect and rate of no3 n in pbs were better than zbs in 6 months regardless of the presence or absence of cod in influent in the zbs as a comparison group when cod was not added to influent no3 n was accumulated at the lowest mean daily temperature during the experiment no2 n accumulated in pbs in a large amount reaching a maximum of 1 30 mg l and then gradually decreased in the next five months this situation did not occur for two bss at 2 12 hours the no3 n concentration in the two bss increased significantly the removal rate of no3 n in pbs in the first 72 h 9 3 mg l 2 7 mg l is faster than the last 72 h 2 7 mg l 1 1 mg l the final concentration of no3 n in zbs 9 5 mg l is slightly higher than influent 9 3 mg l fig 4a with the mean daily temperature increase the removal rate of no3 n of pbs in figs 3b and 4 c in the first 24 h was significantly faster than that in fig 4a however the trend of no3 n concentration in zbs did not change dramatically when the last hrt was increased from 3 days to 6 days the removal rate of no3 n in pbs for 2 h was significantly improved fig 4a 9 3 mg l 7 8 mg l fig 4b 9 2 mg l 7 9 mg l fig 4c 9 1 mg l 7 3 mg l fig 4d 9 6 mg l 3 6 mg l when 20 mg l cod was added to influent the no3 n removal effect in the two bss changed significantly the concentration of no3 n in zbs decreased during 144 h fig 4e 9 1 mg l 4 2 mg l fig 4f 9 3 mg l 3 4 mg l the removal rate of no3 n in water for 2 h in pbs has a huge improvement compared with fig 4d fig 4e 9 1 mg l 1 1 mg l fig 4f 9 3 mg l 1 0 mg l after 24 h the removal rate of no3 n was higher than the previous experiment 3 4 microbial communities fig 5 shows the top twenty relative abundances of the bacterial community on the genus level in the zbs and pbs after running two months with 20 mg l cod in influent eight largest genera in zbs were om60 nor5 clade 8 5 planoglabratella opercularis 6 1 vischeria sp caup q 202 2 2 rhodobacter 1 7 arenimonas 1 6 dinghuibacter 1 4 tabrizicola 1 and hyphomicrobium 0 8 and those in pbs were denitratisoma 3 6 ellin6067 2 7 thiobacillus 2 6 thauera 2 1 cl500 29 marine group 1 8 sulfuritalea 1 7 subgroup 10 1 4 and azoarcus 1 3 it showed that pyrite and zeolite changed the microbial community structure of bs on genus level om60 nor5 clade and dinghuibacter whose abundance 8 5 and 1 4 in zbs was much more than those 0 7 and 0 1 in pbs are reported as aerobic species 37 38 it may indicate that there was a better anaerobic condition in pbs than zbs there are many bacteria involved in denitrification in both bss denitratisoma 0 3 in zbs and 3 6 in pbs and azoarcus 0 1 in zbs and 1 3 in pbs played essential roles in heterotrophic denitrification 39 41 thauera 0 1 in zbs and 2 1 in pbs has been reported to have denitrification 42 43 rhodobacter 1 7 in zbs and 0 8 in pbs has oxygen limited heterotrophic denitrification capabilities 44 46 autotrophic denitrification was another form of denitrification in pbs and zbs thiobacillus played a vital role in pyrite based autotrophic denitrification pbad 47 48 sulfuritalea elemental sulfur as energy sources for its autotrophic growth could utilize no3 n as an electron acceptor 49 50 the abundances of thiobacillus 0 1 in zbs and 2 6 in pbs and sulfuritalea 0 3 in zbs and 1 7 in pbs differed significantly it indicated that more autotrophic denitrification happened in pbs than zbs as recent researches reported genera thauera and thiobacillus could also play an essential role in the fe based autotrophic denitrification systems 27 51 according to the abundance of different denitrifying bacteria in the two bss significantly more denitrification happened in pbs than zbs other noteworthy bacteria were anaeromyxobacter iron reducing bacteria with organic matter as an electron donor 52 although not shown in fig 4 its abundance 0 1 in zbs and 0 8 in pbs also reflects that iron oxidation and reduction reacted more in the pbs than zbs 3 5 performances of a random sampling of so4 2 and fe in the experiment of detecting the change of water quality in the substrate layer the concentration of so4 2 and fe was sampled several times as shown in fig 6a 22 5 of the samples were in class iii and the rest were in class ii fig 6a all of them meted the chinese standards for drinking water quality gb5749 2006 so4 2 150 mg l samples in class iii were all in the first two months of the experiment the trend of fe is different from that of so42 showing an irregular result less than half of the samples meet chinese standards for drinking water quality gb5749 2006 fe 0 3 mg l 4 discussion 4 1 effect of pyrite on tn and tp removal in the first two months of the experiment there was not much difference in tn and tp s removal effect between the two bss fig 3 the layered structure of the bioretention system and the alternation of wet and dry conditions contribute to the nitrification of nh4 n which was also proved by the efficient and stable removal of nh4 n during the entire operation because the substrate background contained a little organic matter and the no3 n concentration of the influent in this study was low compared with wastewater but it had a higher hrt so the tn of both bss could be effectively removed in the early stage of operation as the new matrix had low phosphorus contents and was not saturated both zbs and pbs could effectively adsorb tp some microbial growth also used nutrients moreover microbial growth will also use part of the nutrients fig 3b shows that are merely setting the submerged zone without an electron donor cannot significantly improve the removal effect of tn tp removal efficiency of zbs deteriorated with the experiment while pbs maintained a reasonable level it may be related to the saturation of the adsorption capacity of zeolite in fig 6b the sampling test of the iron element shows irregular results both fe3 and fe2 could form complexes with po4 3 the iron element s sampling results occasionally reached very high indicating that the iron element in the substrate layer may accumulate over time the accumulated iron was beneficial for pbs to maintain the phosphorus removal effect for a long time 4 2 effect of pyrite on nh4 n removal natural zeolite as a traditional material used in the lid project has a good adsorption effect on nh4 n 53 54 nh4 n in zbs effluent is always less than pbs fig 3 but it did not mean that zbs was better at removing nh4 n than pbs the trend of no3 n at the 0 6 h stage in fig 3 shows that nh4 n adsorbed in bs is converted to no3 n due to nitration do dissolved oxygen in the substrate layer of the pbs was scarcer than that of the zbs supported by much more aerobic om60 nor5 clade and dinghuibacter higher do was beneficial to nitrification so nh4 n in the effluent of the zbs was lower than that of the pbs fig 3a it was reported that some azoarcus could convert n2 into nitrogen containing substances and partly into nh4 n 55 which may also be the reason that nh4 n has some residual in the effluent of the pbs in short pyrite has no significant negative effect on the removal of nh4 n in a bs 4 3 possible role of pyrite in bs the removal of tn by bss in this experiment was mainly reflected by the removal of no3 n fig 4 can reflect that pyrite could participate in the denitrification process as an electron donor in the bs especially without the addition of carbon source in the influent pbad was the main way to remove no3 n from groundwater 56 58 it can be expressed as this formula 29 6 n o 3 2 f e s 2 4 h 2 o 3 n 2 4 s o 4 2 2 f e o h 3 2 h moreover pyrite is easily oxidized in the natural environment producing acidic wastewater and polluting the environment it could be expressed as follows 59 4 f e s 2 14 h 2 o 15 o 2 8 s o 4 2 4 f e o h 3 16 h it is why the effluent of pbs was acidic at the beginning of the experiment fig 2 as shown in fig 6a after april the concentration of so4 2 was generally below 100 mg l tn in the influent was no more than 18 mg l fig 3b therefore pyrite oxidation was speculated to be a major factor in the production of so4 2 in pbs 4 4 effects of temperature and carbon source on pbs as shown in fig 4a when the average daily temperature was lower than 20 at the temperature of 13 5 21 2 a significant no2 n accumulation occurred in the pbs it was consistent with the research that the process of converting no3 n to no2 n in pbad was susceptible to a temperature below 20 60 fig 4d shows that a prolonged drought period can increase the initial no3 n removal rate of pbs however adding the carbon source in the feedwater improves the denitrification efficiency more than the form of increasing the temperature fig 4e heterotrophic denitrification is faster than autotrophic denitrification in particular acetate as cod is a small molecule carbon source beneficial to the use of microorganisms in the condition of cod in the influent the effect of temperature increase on the nitrogen removal rate was small fig 4f 4 5 effects of microorganisms in torrento s study pyrite was proved as one of the sulfur sources which could be used by an autotrophic microorganism such as thiobacillus 61 also they proved that pyrite addition could facilitate indigenous microorganism s denitrification ability in treating groundwater even without thiobacillus 58 this result was further confirmed in constructed wetlands the abundance of thiobacillus was 1 2 29 and it was not a dominant genus still it also achieved stable and effective nutrient removal performance thus we could conclude that pyrite could stimulate autotrophic denitrification and increase microorganism abundance and this could also be achieved in a stormwater bioretention system we assumed that both upper overburden layer and elevated outflow pipe which mitigate the massive change of dry wet cycle contribute relatively stable condition for autotrophic microorganism and other functional microorganisms the detailed influence of elevated pipe height matrix permeability upper layer type and the like still needed to be investigated the probable effect of iron on denitrification promotion was investigated 62 it may also be related to the better denitrification effect of pbs 4 6 other observations during the first week of the experiment when the pbs effluent was left in the air for a while significant yellow precipitates were produced it was speculated that the pyrite content in the substrate layer is relatively high which led to the leaching of the iron element at the later period of the experiment visual inspection of suspended matter in the effluent of zbs was much more than pbs the probable reason for this result was the small amount of sludge produced by sulfur autotrophic denitrification 63 64 5 conclusion the average nh4 n tn and tp removal of pbs over eight months were 87 6 4 9 89 3 3 0 and 81 6 4 0 pbs would produce a large amount of nitrite accumulation at low temperatures due to the lack of carbon source 0 mg

the natural pyrite as the substrates and operated for eight months which showed that pyrite had no negative effects on removals of nh4 n but enhanced denitrification in bioretention system with no or low carbon source in the influent zbs constructed with zeolite cannot achieve a good denitrification effect even with a submerged zone the pyrite can ensure stable tp and tn removal effects of the

13873,improving the nitrogen removal capacity of stormwater runoff has been the main research direction of bioretention systems in recent years heterotrophic denitrification in traditional bioretention systems was often used but insufficient carbon sources in the runoff limit it in this study two bioretention systems using natural pyrite and zeolite as substrates were constructed to explore the feasibility of pyrite based autotrophic denitrification in bioretention for nitrogen removal during eight months of operation at natural conditions the results showed that pyrite had no negative effects on the removal of nh4 n but enhanced denitrification in the bioretention system with no or low carbon source in the influent pyrite based bioretention system pbs can adapt to low temperature and irregular wet and dry alternation the average nh4 n tn and tp removal efficiency of pbs during eight months were 87 6 89 3 and 81 6 the average nh4 n tn and tp removal efficiency of zeolite based bioretention system zbs were 98 7 47 1 and 47 5 by products s o 4 2 and total iron of pbs were all at an acceptable level the dominant genera in pbs were denitratisoma 3 6 ellin6067 2 7 thiobacillus 2 6 thauera 2 1 cl500 29 marine group 1 8 sulfuritalea 1 7 subgroup 10 1 4 genera thiobacillus thauera and sulfuritalea were highly related to autotrophic denitrification moreover genera denitratisoma was highly related to heterotrophic denitrification this study shows that pyrite could be a promising eco friendly substrate in the bioretention system for nutrient removal keywords pyrite bioretention system stormwater runoff low impact development denitrification 1 introduction the large scale construction of urban drainage networks and municipal sewage treatment plants has reduced urban point source pollution and non point source pollution has become a significant cause of water pollution 1 measures such as green roofs 2 and constructed wetlands 3 have been studied to treat non point source pollution compared to them bioretention systems are more convenient as one of the most common methods of low impact development the bioretention system bs has a pivotal role in urban stormwater runoff control under different conditions due to its flexibility and availability the design of bs combines the principles of hydraulic flow with physical chemical and biological processes to improve water quality 4 extensive researches have shown that bs can reduce not only flood volumes and stormwater peak flow 5 but also has an excellent performance in removing suspended solids phosphorus p organic matter and heavy metals 6 8 however the removal efficiency of bs for nitrogen n was still limited and fluctuant results from several studies suggest that the removal of n in bss varies greatly 6 9 10 generally bss remove n in stormwater through microbial processes about nitrification for ammonia and denitrification for nitrite and nitrate 11 12 ammonia nitrogen nh4 n control is easy to achieve many results have highlighted the high nh4 n removal in bs 10 13 however compared with the high nh4 n removal the nitrate no3 n removal was not good therefore in recent years many studies mainly focused on the enhancement of denitrification for nitrate removal some enhancement modification such as establishing anoxic conditions usually establishing submerged zone or providing electron donors e g some form of organic carbon to increase no3 n removal 14 17 but the problem of organic matter aging leading to reduced nitrogen removal efficiency also occurred in recent years sulfur based autotrophic denitrification which uses sulfur as an electron donor has attracted many researchers and some of their results showed high nitrogen removal efficiency in the laboratory scale 18 19 this process is well suited for the denitrification of low carbon source wastewater because it does not require additional carbon sources and produces less sludge 20 21 however the extensive use of sulfur in engineering applications adds cost and is not durable pyrite fes2 is one of the most abundant sulfides in the earth s crust 22 studies have shown that pyrite and its derivatives can be used as an electron donor to reduce no3 n to n2 23 24 fe2 and fe3 are also useful for phosphate po4 3 removal 25 26 moreover some recent researches indicate that fe fe ii or fe 0 could support autotrophic denitrification to be a promising process for low carbon water treatment 27 28 most studies were focused on low c n wastewater or groundwater treatment there was little researches focused on the feasibility of the pyrite based denitrification in stormwater treatment a long term study had proven that the use of pyrite as substrates in a constructed wetland which was closest to bioretention could efficiently and stably remove nitrogen and phosphorus for a long time 29 the latest study investigated the performance of a pyrite based constructed wetland microbial fuel cell in nitrate and total phosphorus removal and gained a high removal rate 30 moreover a constructed wetland based pyrrhotite had an excellent performance to remove the glyphosate and nutrients from simulated agriculture runoff 31 these studies show that pyrite has a strong potential in the lid project however the bs still has many differences with the constructed wetland such as its random dry wet alternating characteristics which are entirely dependent on meteorological conditions and its heavily fluctuant flow rate unlike ecosystems connected to water bodies nitrogen migration in bss was only driven by short term stormwater runoff 11 32 12 therefore it is unreasonable to simply use the existing research results and conclusions to judge the application of pyrite in bs to our knowledge there were few reports on the pyrite based bioretention system so in this study a column scaled bs was constructed using pyrite as the substrates and traditional matrix as comparison and operate at the outdoor condition for 8 months this study aimed to 1 explore the feasibility and performance of nutrient removal by using pyrite as the substrates in bs for no carbon source or low carbon source stormwater runoff treatment 2 evaluate the by product of pyrite based bs in alternating climate condition and 3 prove the potential existence of microorganism such as thiobacillus which could use pyrite as an electron donor for autotrophic denitrification the result of this study could provide a new prospect for nutrient removal and eutrophication control of stormwater 2 materials and methods 2 1 simulated biological retention system device two simulated bioretention systems zeolite bioretention system zbs and pyrite bioretention system pbs located in the outdoor condition with rain cover were both constructed with acrylic material with the same configuration φ300 mm h1300 mm the structure of the device and the distribution of each layer of filler were shown in fig 1 the water storage area h200 mm and the overburden h400 mm at the top of the structure simulated the real bioretention system the bottom layer made of pebbles h50 mm mainly played a load bearing and drainage role ceramsite h150 mm quartz sand h100 mm and gravel h100 mm were primarily used to remove suspended solids over the bottom layer a 400 mm submerged zone was created by the outflow elevation of the drainage pipe using 90 elbows the substrate layer in the submerged zone of the pbs was pyrite and that in the zbs was zeolite the zbs was used as a comparison group for pbs to investigate changes of water quality in submerged substrate layer and extract microorganisms on the filler of the two bss an outlet with valve ② in fig 1 and a screwable seal ① in fig 1 was mounted vertically outside the substrate layer water and filler samples were able to be collected from them 2 2 substrates pyrite was obtained from shangbao hunan province china and zeolite was obtained from zhengzhou henan province china the particle size of pyrite and zeolite were between 5 and 7 mm the purity of pyrite used in this study was about 90 the overburden matrix consisted of weathered rock sand 75 volume mixed with local soil 25 volume the particle size of the quartz sand was between 1 and 2 mm the particle sizes of gravel and ceramsite were between 10 and 15 mm the particle size of pebble was between 10 and 20 mm 2 3 operation sampling and analysis before starting the experiment two assembled bss were rinsed with water for two weeks to remove the filler s inherent nutrients since then the simulated stormwater runoff was prepared with the tap water that has been placed for a day to remove residual chlorine nh4cl kno3 and kh2po4 were used to simulate influent nh4 n and no3 n and tp total phosphorus after six months of operation acetate was added as the carbon source to the influent and other constituents remained unchanged referring to the local stormwater runoff pollutant concentration nh4 n was 5 8 mg no3 n was 6 12 mg tp was 0 5 1 1 mg cod chemical oxygen demand was about 20 mg in the earliest two months hrt hydraulic retention time was 3 days in the next months the majority of hrt was 3 days and the remaining hrt was 6 days influent and effluent were collected every hrt the substrate layer s water samples were collected after 2 h 6 h 12 h 24 h 48 h 72 h 96 h 120 h 144 h of influent in 6 days hrt water samples were filtered through 0 45 μm filters before analysis nh4 n no3 n no2 n nitrite tn total nitrogen tp were analyzed using a spectrophotometer a uv vis spectrophotometer hach dr6000 usa so4 2 sulfate was analyzed using an ion chromatograph ics 600 ion chromatography system dionex america total iron fe was analyzed using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer aa6800fg shimadzu japan temperature and ph values were measured using a ph meter hq30d hach usa 2 4 microbial community analysis when cod was added to the influent and ran for two months substrate samples were collected for microbial community analyses genomic dna extraction from fillers referred to li et al 21 total microbial genomic dna samples were extracted using the dneasy powersoil kit qiagen inc netherlands following the manufacturer s instructions and stored at 20 c before further analysis the quantity and quality of extracted dnas were measured using a nanodrop nd 1000 spectrophotometer thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa and agarose gel electrophoresis then pcr was conducted and high throughput sequencing was finished on an illumina miseq platform with miseq reagent kit v3 at shanghai personal biotechnology co ltd shanghai china the used primer in pcr amplification was 338 f 5 actcctacgggaggcagcag 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 3 results 3 1 variation of ph in the effluent fig 2 shows the ph of the effluent from the two bss during the experiment in the first month of the operation the effluent of pbs was acidic in the following months the ph of the effluent from pbs increased steadily then became stable which was still about 0 1 lower than that of zbs the ph of zbs effluent was always relatively stable throughout the entire experiment after adding 20 mg l cod to the influent the effluent ph values of the two bss were close there was not only autotrophic denitrification but also heterotrophic denitrification existed in pbs refer to 3 4 microbial communities therefore after adding organic matter autotrophic denitrification consumed alkalinity and heterotrophic denitrification produced alkalinity the alkalinity produced by the two types of denitrification counterweighed increasing in the ph of pbs although there was mainly heterotrophic denitrification in zbs the denitrification efficiency of zbs was still low after adding cod so its ph does not change much it was the reason why the ph difference between the two bss was small 3 2 performances of nh4 n tn and tp removal for the two bss nh4 n removal was stable while tn and tp removals showed different performance during the experimental process fig 3 during the 8 months the average influent nh4 n was 6 2 0 5 mg l mean s d respectively and accordingly nh4 n removal was 98 7 0 2 for zbs and 87 6 4 9 for pbs fig 3a in the last two months the addition of cod in the influent did not affect nh4 n removal of the two bss numerous studies have shown that most bss have an nh4 n removal of over 70 4 9 fig 3b shows that the tn removal of pbs was relatively stable seasonal changes and the addition of cod in the influent could slightly enhance the effect of pbs while there were fluctuations in tn removal of zbs during the 8 months the average influent tn was 15 5 0 8 mg l respectively and tn removals were 89 3 3 0 for pbs and 47 1 19 0 for zbs fig 3b in the first month the gap in pbs and zbs tn removals was small in the next five months the average tn removal of pbs was much higher than that of zbs even if cod was added to the influent in the last two months the tn removal difference between the two bss was also very pronounced in some previous researches topsoil compost wood chips sand gravel and other materials were used for bss and their tn removal rate was 59 8 92 9 33 36 during the 8 months the average influent tp was 0 8 0 1 mg l respectively and accordingly tp removal was 47 5 15 1 for zbs and 81 6 4 0 for pbs fig 3c tp removal of pbs was as stable as tn zbs s tp removal effect deteriorates with time even if cod was added to the influent in the last two months it is only slightly improved the tp removal of bs was a big difference in many types of research and even the concentration of effluent was higher than that of influent in some studies 7 3 3 changes of no3 n and no2 n in the substrate layer in the 6 months of this experiment collecting water samples from the outlet of the bottom matrix layer and analyzing no3 n and no2 n to study their changes in the substrate layer as shown in fig 4 the removal effect and rate of no3 n in pbs were better than zbs in 6 months regardless of the presence or absence of cod in influent in the zbs as a comparison group when cod was not added to influent no3 n was accumulated at the lowest mean daily temperature during the experiment no2 n accumulated in pbs in a large amount reaching a maximum of 1 30 mg l and then gradually decreased in the next five months this situation did not occur for two bss at 2 12 hours the no3 n concentration in the two bss increased significantly the removal rate of no3 n in pbs in the first 72 h 9 3 mg l 2 7 mg l is faster than the last 72 h 2 7 mg l 1 1 mg l the final concentration of no3 n in zbs 9 5 mg l is slightly higher than influent 9 3 mg l fig 4a with the mean daily temperature increase the removal rate of no3 n of pbs in figs 3b and 4 c in the first 24 h was significantly faster than that in fig 4a however the trend of no3 n concentration in zbs did not change dramatically when the last hrt was increased from 3 days to 6 days the removal rate of no3 n in pbs for 2 h was significantly improved fig 4a 9 3 mg l 7 8 mg l fig 4b 9 2 mg l 7 9 mg l fig 4c 9 1 mg l 7 3 mg l fig 4d 9 6 mg l 3 6 mg l when 20 mg l cod was added to influent the no3 n removal effect in the two bss changed significantly the concentration of no3 n in zbs decreased during 144 h fig 4e 9 1 mg l 4 2 mg l fig 4f 9 3 mg l 3 4 mg l the removal rate of no3 n in water for 2 h in pbs has a huge improvement compared with fig 4d fig 4e 9 1 mg l 1 1 mg l fig 4f 9 3 mg l 1 0 mg l after 24 h the removal rate of no3 n was higher than the previous experiment 3 4 microbial communities fig 5 shows the top twenty relative abundances of the bacterial community on the genus level in the zbs and pbs after running two months with 20 mg l cod in influent eight largest genera in zbs were om60 nor5 clade 8 5 planoglabratella opercularis 6 1 vischeria sp caup q 202 2 2 rhodobacter 1 7 arenimonas 1 6 dinghuibacter 1 4 tabrizicola 1 and hyphomicrobium 0 8 and those in pbs were denitratisoma 3 6 ellin6067 2 7 thiobacillus 2 6 thauera 2 1 cl500 29 marine group 1 8 sulfuritalea 1 7 subgroup 10 1 4 and azoarcus 1 3 it showed that pyrite and zeolite changed the microbial community structure of bs on genus level om60 nor5 clade and dinghuibacter whose abundance 8 5 and 1 4 in zbs was much more than those 0 7 and 0 1 in pbs are reported as aerobic species 37 38 it may indicate that there was a better anaerobic condition in pbs than zbs there are many bacteria involved in denitrification in both bss denitratisoma 0 3 in zbs and 3 6 in pbs and azoarcus 0 1 in zbs and 1 3 in pbs played essential roles in heterotrophic denitrification 39 41 thauera 0 1 in zbs and 2 1 in pbs has been reported to have denitrification 42 43 rhodobacter 1 7 in zbs and 0 8 in pbs has oxygen limited heterotrophic denitrification capabilities 44 46 autotrophic denitrification was another form of denitrification in pbs and zbs thiobacillus played a vital role in pyrite based autotrophic denitrification pbad 47 48 sulfuritalea elemental sulfur as energy sources for its autotrophic growth could utilize no3 n as an electron acceptor 49 50 the abundances of thiobacillus 0 1 in zbs and 2 6 in pbs and sulfuritalea 0 3 in zbs and 1 7 in pbs differed significantly it indicated that more autotrophic denitrification happened in pbs than zbs as recent researches reported genera thauera and thiobacillus could also play an essential role in the fe based autotrophic denitrification systems 27 51 according to the abundance of different denitrifying bacteria in the two bss significantly more denitrification happened in pbs than zbs other noteworthy bacteria were anaeromyxobacter iron reducing bacteria with organic matter as an electron donor 52 although not shown in fig 4 its abundance 0 1 in zbs and 0 8 in pbs also reflects that iron oxidation and reduction reacted more in the pbs than zbs 3 5 performances of a random sampling of so4 2 and fe in the experiment of detecting the change of water quality in the substrate layer the concentration of so4 2 and fe was sampled several times as shown in fig 6a 22 5 of the samples were in class iii and the rest were in class ii fig 6a all of them meted the chinese standards for drinking water quality gb5749 2006 so4 2 150 mg l samples in class iii were all in the first two months of the experiment the trend of fe is different from that of so42 showing an irregular result less than half of the samples meet chinese standards for drinking water quality gb5749 2006 fe 0 3 mg l 4 discussion 4 1 effect of pyrite on tn and tp removal in the first two months of the experiment there was not much difference in tn and tp s removal effect between the two bss fig 3 the layered structure of the bioretention system and the alternation of wet and dry conditions contribute to the nitrification of nh4 n which was also proved by the efficient and stable removal of nh4 n during the entire operation because the substrate background contained a little organic matter and the no3 n concentration of the influent in this study was low compared with wastewater but it had a higher hrt so the tn of both bss could be effectively removed in the early stage of operation as the new matrix had low phosphorus contents and was not saturated both zbs and pbs could effectively adsorb tp some microbial growth also used nutrients moreover microbial growth will also use part of the nutrients fig 3b shows that are merely setting the submerged zone without an electron donor cannot significantly improve the removal effect of tn tp removal efficiency of zbs deteriorated with the experiment while pbs maintained a reasonable level it may be related to the saturation of the adsorption capacity of zeolite in fig 6b the sampling test of the iron element shows irregular results both fe3 and fe2 could form complexes with po4 3 the iron element s sampling results occasionally reached very high indicating that the iron element in the substrate layer may accumulate over time the accumulated iron was beneficial for pbs to maintain the phosphorus removal effect for a long time 4 2 effect of pyrite on nh4 n removal natural zeolite as a traditional material used in the lid project has a good adsorption effect on nh4 n 53 54 nh4 n in zbs effluent is always less than pbs fig 3 but it did not mean that zbs was better at removing nh4 n than pbs the trend of no3 n at the 0 6 h stage in fig 3 shows that nh4 n adsorbed in bs is converted to no3 n due to nitration do dissolved oxygen in the substrate layer of the pbs was scarcer than that of the zbs supported by much more aerobic om60 nor5 clade and dinghuibacter higher do was beneficial to nitrification so nh4 n in the effluent of the zbs was lower than that of the pbs fig 3a it was reported that some azoarcus could convert n2 into nitrogen containing substances and partly into nh4 n 55 which may also be the reason that nh4 n has some residual in the effluent of the pbs in short pyrite has no significant negative effect on the removal of nh4 n in a bs 4 3 possible role of pyrite in bs the removal of tn by bss in this experiment was mainly reflected by the removal of no3 n fig 4 can reflect that pyrite could participate in the denitrification process as an electron donor in the bs especially without the addition of carbon source in the influent pbad was the main way to remove no3 n from groundwater 56 58 it can be expressed as this formula 29 6 n o 3 2 f e s 2 4 h 2 o 3 n 2 4 s o 4 2 2 f e o h 3 2 h moreover pyrite is easily oxidized in the natural environment producing acidic wastewater and polluting the environment it could be expressed as follows 59 4 f e s 2 14 h 2 o 15 o 2 8 s o 4 2 4 f e o h 3 16 h it is why the effluent of pbs was acidic at the beginning of the experiment fig 2 as shown in fig 6a after april the concentration of so4 2 was generally below 100 mg l tn in the influent was no more than 18 mg l fig 3b therefore pyrite oxidation was speculated to be a major factor in the production of so4 2 in pbs 4 4 effects of temperature and carbon source on pbs as shown in fig 4a when the average daily temperature was lower than 20 at the temperature of 13 5 21 2 a significant no2 n accumulation occurred in the pbs it was consistent with the research that the process of converting no3 n to no2 n in pbad was susceptible to a temperature below 20 60 fig 4d shows that a prolonged drought period can increase the initial no3 n removal rate of pbs however adding the carbon source in the feedwater improves the denitrification efficiency more than the form of increasing the temperature fig 4e heterotrophic denitrification is faster than autotrophic denitrification in particular acetate as cod is a small molecule carbon source beneficial to the use of microorganisms in the condition of cod in the influent the effect of temperature increase on the nitrogen removal rate was small fig 4f 4 5 effects of microorganisms in torrento s study pyrite was proved as one of the sulfur sources which could be used by an autotrophic microorganism such as thiobacillus 61 also they proved that pyrite addition could facilitate indigenous microorganism s denitrification ability in treating groundwater even without thiobacillus 58 this result was further confirmed in constructed wetlands the abundance of thiobacillus was 1 2 29 and it was not a dominant genus still it also achieved stable and effective nutrient removal performance thus we could conclude that pyrite could stimulate autotrophic denitrification and increase microorganism abundance and this could also be achieved in a stormwater bioretention system we assumed that both upper overburden layer and elevated outflow pipe which mitigate the massive change of dry wet cycle contribute relatively stable condition for autotrophic microorganism and other functional microorganisms the detailed influence of elevated pipe height matrix permeability upper layer type and the like still needed to be investigated the probable effect of iron on denitrification promotion was investigated 62 it may also be related to the better denitrification effect of pbs 4 6 other observations during the first week of the experiment when the pbs effluent was left in the air for a while significant yellow precipitates were produced it was speculated that the pyrite content in the substrate layer is relatively high which led to the leaching of the iron element at the later period of the experiment visual inspection of suspended matter in the effluent of zbs was much more than pbs the probable reason for this result was the small amount of sludge produced by sulfur autotrophic denitrification 63 64 5 conclusion the average nh4 n tn and tp removal of pbs over eight months were 87 6 4 9 89 3 3 0 and 81 6 4 0 pbs would produce a large amount of nitrite accumulation at low temperatures due to the lack of carbon source 0 mg

adsorption study was conducted under dark condition while the photo degradation photoadsorption study was carried out in the presence of uv light 360 nm and 18 w and adequate quantity of oxygen the adsorption efficiency was found to be 8 361 mg cv g tnt using langmuir isotherm dimensionless parameter rl 1 suggested the favourable adsorption of cv onto the tnt surfaces whereas positive δg 2 673 kj mol value suggested the non spontaneity of the process regeneration of the exhausted material with etoh and its reuse suppressed the efficiency of the material adsorption followed the pseudo second

remove cv from spiked tap water and pond water with an efficiency of 75 in each case keywords tnt synthesis cv adsorption photodegradation isotherm mathematical modelling turnover study mechanism 1 introduction water pollution and its adverse effect to the environment as well as to the human health are of great concern pollution is mainly due to the discharge of untreated or partially treated effluents from various industries or sewage treatment plants precipitation helps the disposed off contaminants or the pollutants from the natural phenomena to mix with the surface water and finally leach to the groundwater 1 gradual intake of highly contaminated or polluted water causes the denaturation of enzymes in our body 2 3 who prescribed guidelines for each and every contaminant in aquatic system the dye industries generate significant amount of wastewater which after partial or no treatment are discharged over soil or water bodies causing pollution to the natural environment importantly most of these dyes are carcinogenic in nature and directly affects our life till date there are no rules and regulations to control over the use and discharge of different dye contaminated wastewater crystal violet cv dye one of the widely used dyes in textile industries is known for its mutagenic and mitotic poisoning nature it is carcinogen and acute cv causes serious eye damage and very toxic to aquatic life with long lasting effects 4 6 different techniques have been proposed and are being in use to remove theses toxic dyes from the aquatic system with limitations adsorption precipitation electro coagulation chemical oxidation photodegradation are some of the widely used developed techniques to remove the dyes from the dye bearing wastewater 4 6 among the developed techniques adsorption and photodegradation were found to be popularly adopted as used precursors are re usable and recyclable after desorption with suitable solvent presently the semiconducting materials are used either in solo or as composite doped hybrid where they act as adsorbent to adsorb solutes and also as photocatalyst to degrade the contaminants pollutants dye s from aquatic system 7 9 semiconducting materials are non toxic eco friendly and cheap titanium dioxide tio2 in this regard is one of the best and common semiconducting materials used for its low band gap of 3 2 ev although few doped tio2 materials were also reported the white solid metal oxide tio2 acts as a good adsorbent and because of its photocatalytic property conducts the electronic transition from the lower stable valence band vb to the high energetic empty conduction band cb to mineralise the dye molecules in the presence of uv radiation and oxygen in the suspension 10 13 tio2 as purchased commercially has been utilized by many researchers to remove the different organics dyes from the aqueous medium extensive studies were also conducted on the synthesis and characterization of titanate nanotube tnt or doped tnt 14 19 it can be noted that the doped or composite materials have greater efficiency towards the contaminants however in long run these materials may leach and join the effluent necessitating post treatment moreover these composite materials are difficult to synthesize and is also considered to be costly for day to day use activated carbon is superior adsorbent for any kind of contaminants but does not have any band gap for the conduction of electron form vb to cb for photodegradation of organics this activated carbon is also costly as compared to tio2 or tnt the studies conducted on tnt mainly focussed on evaluation of the adsorption photodegradation potential of tnt for removal of the dyes 14 however extensive elaborate studies on dye s removal using tnt as adsorbent as well as photocatalyst is lacking the present study is conducted to utilize hydrothermally synthesized titanate nanotubes tnts for removal of cv from spiked wastewater samples with the following specific objectives hydrothermal synthesization and characterization of titanate nanotubes tnts by xrd sem edx and tem evaluation of effect of the contact time dose of tnts concentration of dye and ph on the removal efficiency of cv using as prepared tnts conduction of isotherm study to understand the adsorptive behaviour of tnts towards cv determination of the effect of coexisting ions on the removal efficiency of cv evaluation of the re usability of the used and exhausted materials of tnts though turn over study application of tnts to remove cv from real spiked water samples 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents all analytical grade reagents were used as received all aqueous solutions were prepared using double distilled water synthetic cv stock solution with a concentration

tap water before being dried in a hot air oven all absorbance measurements were carried out using a spectrophotometer uv 1800 shimazdu japan equipped with 1 cm quartz cell tem measurement was done in a jem 1400 jeol japan transmission electron microscope operating at 120 kv sem edx study was conducted using fei sem apreo lovac for phase determination x ray diffractometer shimazdu xrd 6100 equipped with a cu kα radiation was used a high precision electronic balance sartorius bsa2245 cw was used for weighing gilson micropipettes with disposable tips were used to add samples a digital ph meter wensar wph 10 was used to measure all ph values water quality parameters were measured using titrimetric methods a hand made light set up was used for the photodegradation of dye photon was emitted from the uv light source of wavelength 360 nm and power 18 w uv c made in germany the total set up was covered with a black cloth in order to protect the emission of hazardous uv rays to the surrounding fig 1 2 3 synthesis of tnt tnt was hydrothermally synthesized following the earlier published work 14 16 typically in a beaker 25 gg of p 25 tio2 powder was blended with 100 ml aqueous naoh 10 m solution the mixture was then subjected to continuous stirring 520 540 rpm for 1 h using an electrically operated magnetic stirrer remi 2mlh the mixture was then kept in a hydrothermal unit of stainless steel teflon lined autoclave for the hydrothermal treatment the mixture in the autoclave was heated to 150 160 c for a prescribed period of 24 h using a hot air oven and finally cooled to room temperature the final product in the autoclave was repeatedly washed with double distilled water with the aim of achieving the neutral ph of 7 finally the white solid was centrifuged 9000 rpm for 10 min to separate tnt and dried at 80 c for 6 h in a hot air oven and kept in a dry black box under dark condition for further use for adsorption photodegradation of organic dye cv from aqueous media the as prepared tnt was characterised instrumentally with tem xrd sem edx after synthesis of tnt the dried material was treated with dilute acid hcl 10 2 m below ph 2 1 h interval with 6 times 3 g tnt 10 ml solution which may help to replace na by h the acid treated suspension was repeatedly washed in double distilled water after each time of acid treatment after achieving ph 7 suspension was centrifuged and dried as mentioned and characterised called htnt 14 17 2 4 adsorption photocatalytic degradation of dye in the present work the adsorptive photocatalytic activity of both synthesized tnt and htnt were studied to remove toxic organic dye cv from aqueous media applying the same conditions the adsorption study was conducted in absence of uv light and the photodegradation study was understood by uv irradiation in the experiment 3 g l dose of as prepared tnt htnt was dispersed in 50 ml of synthetic cv solution taking in a 500 ml beaker 55 44 cm2 bed height from light source to the surface of the solution is 13 2 cm with an initial dye concentration of 20 mg l and at a ph of 6 8 0 2 the suspension was then put on the magnetic stirrer remi 2 mlh under a photocatalytic reactor fig 1 initially the adsorption study was conducted in the absence of uv light after getting an equilibrium point of adsorption the same suspension was then photo irradiated by uv illumination an 18 w 360 nm uv lamp was used as the light source the aqueous system of suspension was oxygenated to ensure the system had enough oxygen by aging at 520 540 rpm with a magnetic needle the experiment was conducted at room temperature 25 2 c the total adsorption and uv irradiation time followed was 6 h 2 0 4 0 h the suspension was then centrifuged remi r 24 at 9000 rpm for 10 min in order to separate the solid and liquid phase from the experimental solutions the supernatant liquid was collected after centrifugation and the remaining dye concentration in the supernatant was measured by using uv vis spectrophotometer at 587 nm it is important to mention here that during the time of adsorption of dye on tnt sbet 187 m2 g in dark condition absence of uv light the dye might have a little chance to degrade in the presence of ir however as degradation due to ir is a very slow process it is considered here predominantly adsorption process occurred the supernatant aliquot was carefully collected after centrifugation with a 1000 ml micropipette and the residual dye concentration was measured study was also conducted by varying the surface area of the solution 113 08 cm2 and 38 50 cm2 keeping the distance between the surface of the solution and the light source same the obtained results showed almost no effect on dye degradation 5 it is because each and every time the number of precursor s site and chemical moiety is same the experiments were also conducted with shorter wavelength 254 nm it has been observed that the volume of the contaminant solution is reduced to 40 ml initial solution was 50 ml shorter wavelength of the light transfers high energy which ultimately reduces the volume of the solution 3 results and discussion 3 1 analytical procedure a standard calibration curve of cv λmax 587 nm was drawn taking the concentrations in the range of 0 20 mg l air as blank the linear equation of the calibration curve is absorbance y 0 095x mg l 0 01 the specific relation co efficient r2 0 998 this linear equation was used for further quantification of dye concentrations remaining in the effluent 3 2 synthesis of titanate nanotubes synthesis of tnt from commercially available tio2 powder is well known 14 16 it is believed that treatment of tio2 with strong aqueous solution of naoh the positive charge na is encapsulated in between the edge shared of tio6 and octahedral layers of na2ti3o7 in this critical situation a positive strong generated static attractive force holds na and tio6 units tightly together prohibiting the rolling of these layers into the nanotubes in hydrothermal treatment over a period of time na gradually gets un encapsulated with intercalated h2o molecules into the interlayer space of tio6 sheets larger size of h2o molecule than na helps in enlargement of interlayer distance during na un encapsulation weakening attractive static interaction force existing between tio6 and octahedral layers finally layered na2ti3o7 particle gradually exfoliates to form numerous sheet shaped products 18 19 and finally rolls to nanotubes the nanotubes formation mechanism is shown in fig 2 14 20 21 xrd sem edx studies were performed in order to characterize the as prepared tnt and htnt 3 3 characterisation of tnt the evaluation of phase and structure of the synthesized samples was carried out using an x ray diffractometer shimazdu xrd 6100 with cu kα radiation of wavelength λ 0 15406 nm in the scan range 2θ 20 80 with a data acquisition rate of 0 033 per step nanostructured titanate materials produced by alkaline hydrothermal treatment are not amorphous and have well defined crystalline structures however there are several controversial issues regarding the exact crystal structure of nanostructured titanate materials synthesized by alkaline hydrothermal treatment 14 21 firstly for protonated forms of polytitanic acids h 2m ti n o 2n m as well as for pure tio2 a lot of cyrstal modifications are reported further during the formation of nanotube structures wrapping along a certain crystallographic axis results in the widening of peaks along this direction and therefore assigning miller indices to those peaks are difficult in addition to that the titanate nanotubes are relatively unstable and can easily undergo phase transformation during heating acid treatment or other chemical treatments during or after preparation of nanotubes 14 17 the x ray diffraction xrd pattern of two samples has been measured in order to determine the crystalline phases present in the nanostructures the xrd pattern of sample 1 tnt and sample 2 htnt are shown in fig 3 it has been observed that both the samples do not contain any rutile or anatase phase of tio2 further similar types of diffraction peaks are present in both the samples except a little change in intensity the diffraction peaks of the samples can be correlated with a2ti n o2 n 1 crystallographic series with n 5 and a h na 17 after removing the sodium from sample 1 by hcl h2o washing no additional peaks in the xrd pattern appeared except a little change in intensity for all the peaks as compared to that of sample 1 in the present study it has been observed that the xrd pattern of sample 2 matches fairly well with the monoclinic c2 m h2ti5o11 h2o structure jcpdf 00 044 0131 these results suggest that sample 2 originates from sodium titanate phase a comparison of the observed 2θ values in degree and interplanar spacing dhkl along with the standard values are summarised in table 1 sem edx study was conducted using fei sem apreo lovac for both tnt and htnt however with some impurities the main composition of the synthesized precursors was found to be the titanium as p 25 is 99 pure the sorret bands as obtained are shown in fig 4 a and b the shape and size of the synthesized precursor did not clear from the obtained sem image and showed the amorphous one fig 5 shows the tem image of tnt only which shows the clear image of the formation of tnt with a diameter of 50 nm 3 4 effect of contact time contact time between the solute and sorbent is one of the important parameters which enable us to know the boundary condition between the two components to achieve the saturation point of the uptaking of solute on sorbent surface although it will depend on the nature of solute and sorbent the study was conducted in two steps i e i adsorption and photodegradation 2 h without uv light and 4 h with uv light and ii photodegradation only 6 h photo irradiation with uv light where the dose of tnt cv ph and stirring speed were 3 g l 20 mg l 6 8 0 2 and 520 540 rpm respectively optimal conditions in the first step adsorption saturation point was achieved after 2 h fig 6 where the maximum removal of cv was obtained 80 after then due to the photodegradation of cv in presence of photocatalyst tnt the removal was 95 this can be explained by stating that adsorption efficiency is increased till the numbers of available adsorbent sites are active remaining minimum numbers of photocatalyst tnt sites which are not exposed in adsorption process may have the chance to degrade the solute in the presence of uv light and adequate amount of oxygen by transfer of electron s from vb to cb of the semiconductor photocatalyst in the second step i e in the presence of uv light only at the beginning rate of removal efficiency of cv was high and then suppressed the obtained results may be due to the presence of fresh tnt photocatalyst surfaces and also due to the simultaneously adsorption and photodegradation photoadsorption of the solute molecules as the fresh and active sites are slowly exhausted photodegradation also suppressed the study has also been conducted in the presence of bright sunlight in a bright sunny day the results revealed that sunlight has a degradation efficiency 20 of uv light in order to investigate the mechanism of solute adsorption on to the adsorbent pseudo second order reaction model 22 based on the solid phase sorption was analysed the linearized form of pseudo second order reaction model can be written as 1 t q t 1 h 1 q e t h initial sorption rate constant k qe 2 linear plot of t qt vs time t confirms that the reaction rate followed pseudo second order kinetics fig 7 and was concluded by confining the specific relation co efficient value r2 0 9997 3 5 effect of dose a series of experiments were conducted in order to determine the dose of the prepared precursor to achieve the maximum removal efficiency of dye from the aqueous media which is one of the prime parameters of this study the dose was varied in the range of 1 5 g l fig 8 keeping the cv concentration at 20 mg l dye removal mechanism from wastewater on tnt surfaces followed both adsorption in absence of light and then photodegradation in presence of uv light to achieve the maximum removal percentage increasing the doses of the precursors the overall removal efficiency degradation of cv increased due to increment of the active positive precursor s sites leading to more degradation of the chemical moiety of the hydrophilic cv initially after achieving the equilibrium point of adsorption in dark 80 2 0 h the suspension was then allowed to photo irradiated for another 4 0 h to achieve the final 95 removal hence the total time for both the mechanisms elapsed was 6 0 h 2 0 h 4 0 h during photodegradation increment of precursor sites accelerates the photon absorption from the light source causing the higher photoadsorption photo degradation efficiency of the chemical moiety however it has been observed that 3 g l dose of tnt was efficient to remove 95 dye from aquatic system it is worth to mention here that under the same experimental conditions both the precursors i e tnt and htnt have the equal removal efficiency towards cv hence the entire studies were conducted using tnt only 3 6 concentration variation keeping the dose of tnt 3 g l agitation time 6 h photodegradation ph 6 8 0 2 and temperature 25 2 c fixed the study was conducted by varying dye concentrations in the range of 10 40 mg l the results of the concentration variation study are presented in fig 9 it can be observed that removal efficiency of the precursors suppressed from 98s to 70 with increase in the concentration of cv this result was not contradictory as the precursor s sites are constant and fixed with respect to the increment of chemical moieties 3 7 effect of ph on cv removal in the present study ph was varied between 2 0 and 10 0 to evaluate its effect on the removal efficiency of cv for any particular ph the study followed two steps viz adsorption without uv light 2 h and photodegradation 4 h keeping all other experimental conditions fixed fig 10 shows the decreasing efficiency of cv adsorption degradation on tnt with increasing or decreasing ph of the media however we conducted the entire studies at a ph of 6 8 0 2 the ph of double distilled water the dye structure is completely ph dependent hence the different structured organic moiety may have different affinity towards tnt surfaces similar results have also been reported earlier 23 again it may be explained with the surface charge of tnt i e phzpc the phzpc of tnt was determined to be 8 04 indicating zero surface charge the adsorption of cationic cv on tnt in the experimental ph 6 8 0 2 is not a spontaneous one and has also been proved by the calculation of free energy change δg o of the process again the suppression in removal efficiency of cv with increasing or decreasing ph of the media may be due to the different structural property of cv 3 8 isotherm study it is important to investigate the amount of solute sorbed at constant temperature on a particular amount of sorbent in this study we had conducted both the langmuir and freuindlich isotherms at 25 2 c to understand the sportive behaviour of tnt towards cv with dose variation 1 0 3 0 g l and at a constant cv concentration of 20 mg l the larger hydrophilic groups tend to adsorbed on to tnt surfaces without uv light and further immobilized to aqueous environment the linearized langmuir isotherm was drawn fig 11 a by plotting 1 qe vs 1 ce using the following equation as follows 24 2 1 q e 1 q max 1 b q max 1 c e where qe is the amount of adsorbate on adsorbent surfaces at equilibrium mg g qmax is the maximum adsorption capacity mg g ce is the equilibrium concentration mg l b is constant related to energy of the adsorption system l mg the linearized equation obtained as 1 qe 0 3499 1 ce 0 1196 the specific relation co efficient r2 was found to be 0 9772 the maximum adsorptive capacity qmax was calculated to be 8 361 mg cv g tnt the linearized freuindlich isotherm fig 11 b was drawn by plotting lnqe vs lnce using the following equation as follows 25 3 ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e where kf is the freuindlich constant related to adsorption capacity 1 n is the adsorption intensity the linearized equation obtained as lnqe 0 2810 lnce 1 2198 the specific relation co efficient r2 was found to be 0 9849 the maximum adsorptive capacity kf was calculated to be 3 387 mg cv g tnt the adsorption intensity n was found to be 3 56 this high of value n 1 reflects high affinity of cv towards tnt specific relation co efficient values of both isotherms suggested the adsorption model follows the freuindlich isotherm in a little better way than langmuir table 2 dimensionless equilibrium parameter rl was evaluated using the following equation the value was important to understand whether the langmuir adsorption is favourable or unfavourable for cv on synthesized precursor 4 r l 1 1 b c 0 where co is the initial cv concentration mg l and b is the langmuir isotherm constant table 2 rl 1 indicates that adsorption is favourable whereas rl 1 means that adsorption is unfavourable the value of rl for an initial cv concentration of 20 mg l was 0 13 indicating that adsorption is favourable 26 27 the following equation calculates the standard gibbs free energy changes δg o for the adsorption process 5 ln 1 b δ g o r t where b table 2 is the langmuir isotherm constant r is the universal gas constant 8 3145 j mol 1 k 1 and t is the absolute temperature positive δg o value 2 673 kj mol indicates the cv adsorption on tnt is not a spontaneous process 26 28 it may be attributed to the larger sized organic moiety of cv dubinin radushkevich d r isotherm was drawn by plotting lnq vs ε 2 fig 11 c in order to understand the mechanisms of adsorption on to tnt i e physisorption or chemisorptions using the following linear equation 26 27 29 30 6 ln q ln q m k ε 2 where ε polanyi potentiali rt ln 1 1 ce q is amount of cv adsorbed per unit weight of adsorbent mg g qm is adsorption capacity 11 00 mg cv g tnt k is a constant related to adsorption energy r is the universal gas constant t is the absolute temperature k the mean free energy of adsorption e defined as free energy change when one mole of ion is transferred from infinity in solution to the surface of the solid was calculated from the k value using the equation 7 e 2 k 0 5 the calculated e value 3 829 kj mole indicates the adsorption of cv onto tnt is of physisorption as the obtained value is lower than 8 kj mole 26 27 29 30 3 9 effect of co existing ions real dye s bearing sample contains different types of co existing ions hence the study was conducted in the presence of different coexisting foreign ions in the aquatic system to find out their affect on cv removal if any the complete photodegradation studies were conducted in the optimal conditions cv degradation efficiency gradually decreased in the presence of calcium chloride sulphate and nitrate anions table 3 in the range of 50 400 mg l again the same results have also been observed for the other ions of silicate phosphate and the rare presence of edta at concentrations ranging from 0 to 30 mg l table 4 however drastic suppression rate was observed for calcium the same trend was also observed for the presence of fe ii in the concentration of only 0 5 mg l this attributed result may be explained by the fact that salts of each ion may have chance to coat on to tnt surfaces causing the prohibition of electronic transfer mineralize the solute dye 23 3 10 empirical formulation for adsorption process the experiments performed to determine the percent of removal of dye may be empirically expressed in the form of differential equation as 8 p d p c p t v 2 w 1 d p d w 2 c p c w 3 t p t p d p c p t 3 z 1 d 2 p d z 2 c 2 p c z 3 t 2 p t p d p c p t 1 d 5 10 c 40 0 5 t 6 5 where p d c and t are the percentage of removal dose of tnt g l concentration of violet dye ppm and time h of contact respectively and w 1 w 2 w 3 z 1 z 2 z 3 v are constants subjected to the constraints of operation the variables d c and t are independent of one another the system proposed in this paper shall always be optimized at a particular set of variables d c t the eq 8 is valid for the specific optimized set of variables since the equation has been framed based on our experimental results it can act as a fundamental equation for the complex cases of simultaneous changes in more than one variable instead of one however with appropriate boundary conditions 31 the equation can be solved either computationally or analytically if the boundary equations are simpler as in our case this further provides an idea of the trend of variation in percentage of dye removal with respect to its independent variables the constants for variations in the variables are tabulated here where c 1 c 2 and c 3 are constants of integration for d c and t the constant values are shown in table 5 the optimized set of variables for tnt dose concentration of cv and the adsorption time were found to be 3 g l 20 mg l and 2 h respectively 3 11 probable mechanism under uv irradiation the activated cv molecules dye were converted into short lived active transient free radical species on contacting with tnt surfaces transferring the produced negative charged electron s on it this produced electron s can be injected into the conduction band of tnt connected through the nanotube channels 32 this injective process could also be directly performed by radical dye molecules 33 the injected electrons were captured by the surface adsorbed o2 molecules to yield o2 and ho radical among others finally the dye molecules could be quickly mineralized by the radicals the probable photo degradation mechanism of dye under uv light using tnt is shown as follows 34 and the probable scheme of adsorption and photodegradation is shown in fig 12 9 dye hν dye 10 dye tnt dye tnt e 11 tnt e o2 tnt o2 12 o2 tnt e 2h h2o2 13 h2o2 tnt e oh oh 14 dye o2 or o2 or oh peroxylated or hydroxylated intermediates degraded or mineralized products 3 12 turn over study the turn over study is conducted to understand the re usability of the used and exhausted materials after the end of first cycle of experiment the exhausted material produced 2 g was repeatedly washed using 100 ethyl alcohol till to recover the 90 of adsorbed cv finally the desorbed material was washed in double distilled water and dried at 80 c in hot air oven for 6 h following the similar way two times of turn over studies were conducted in the same experimental conditions photodegradation the experimental results revealed the suppression of dye photoadsorption degradation in each cycle 76 62 the obtained experimental results may be due to the unavailability of the fresh and active sites of the precursors and blocking of the sites due to the presence of dye molecules on the precursor surfaces inhibiting the electronic transfer to the cb from the vb to mineralise the solute molecules 4 application to spiked real water sample tap water was collected from the environment engineering lab of kiit deemed to be university and pond water was collected from the pond near to the kiss university cv at the rate of 20 mg l was spiked both in the tap and pond water the adsorbent dose was used as 3 g l the adsorption degradation experiments were carried out at 25 2 c and at an agitation speed of 520 540 rpm the obtained results revealed that 3 g l dose of adsorbent efficiently removed 75 of cv in both the cases table 6 shows the water quality of tap and pond water before and after treatment the obtained result may be useful for the practical purposes it is worth to mention here that uv rays can kill the pathogens present if any in the water sample which is also an important parameter to maintain the water quality 5 comparative study with other methods of removal of cv there have many research works conducted for the removal of cv from aqueous medium 35 40 the major findings of the previously conducted research work and the present study are reported in table 7 it can be noted from the table that in the previous studies on removal of cv mostly biological or natural adsorbents were used further it can be observed that the material efficiency of clay rubber seed moroccan pyrophyllite and anatolian black pine are better than the tnt used in the present study these precursor materials mainly acted as adsorbents and with higher specific surface areas than tnt performed better in adsorption than tnt however use of tnt as an adsorbent as well as photocatalyst performed two significant roles at a time tnt not only removed the pollutants through adsorption and photodegradation but also ensured the destruction of pathogens in the wastewater by photodegradation it is strongly believed that the current technique of removal of cv using tnt will prove to be a better one than the other existing methods in the long run as tnt is cheaply available highly abundant possess strong oxidative power disinfecting power and has high structural and chemical stability 6 conclusions titanate nanotubes tnts were hydrothermally synthesized and characterized by sem edx and tem the crystallography of tnt was understood by xrd these hydrothermally synthesized tnts were used to remove crystal violet cv from the spiked synthetic water the cv removal from the aquatic system followed two kinds of mechanism i e adsorption and photodegradation it was observed that 3 g l dose of the semiconductor photocatalyst tnt was efficient to remove 95 final of cv from the water medium at room temperature and at a ph of 6 8 0 2 with the shaking speed of 520 20 rpm the adsorptive capacity of tnt and feasibility of the adsorption process was evaluated from the langmuir and d r isotherms reaction mechanism followed the pseudo second order kinetics ph variation of the medium indicated the suppression of cv removal which was also observed in the presence of co existing ions in the medium the adsorption process was empirically formulated with the variation dose time and initial dye concentration turnover study showed suppressed removal efficiency of the regenerated exhausted material the probable photodegradation mechanism of the dye was also proposed finally the technique was applied to remove cv from spiked tap water and pond water separately

13874,titanate nanotubes tnts were synthesized hydrothermally at temperatures ranging between 150 and 160 c the synthesized nanotubes were characterised by xrd sem edx and tem the as prepared nanotubes were used to remove crystal violet cv from the aquatic environment through adsorption degradation and photoadsorption all the experiments were conducted at room temperature 25 2 c the adsorption study was conducted under dark condition while the photo degradation photoadsorption study was carried out in the presence of uv light 360 nm and 18 w and adequate quantity of oxygen the adsorption efficiency was found to be 8 361 mg cv g tnt using langmuir isotherm dimensionless parameter rl 1 suggested the favourable adsorption of cv onto the tnt surfaces whereas positive δg 2 673 kj mol value suggested the non spontaneity of the process regeneration of the exhausted material with etoh and its reuse suppressed the efficiency of the material adsorption followed the pseudo second order reaction model adsorption degradation of cv in the presence of co existing foreign ions was also evaluated probable adsorption photodegradation mechanism was proposed finally tnt was used to remove cv from spiked tap water and pond water with an efficiency of 75 in each case keywords tnt synthesis cv adsorption photodegradation isotherm mathematical modelling turnover study mechanism 1 introduction water pollution and its adverse effect to the environment as well as to the human health are of great concern pollution is mainly due to the discharge of untreated or partially treated effluents from various industries or sewage treatment plants precipitation helps the disposed off contaminants or the pollutants from the natural phenomena to mix with the surface water and finally leach to the groundwater 1 gradual intake of highly contaminated or polluted water causes the denaturation of enzymes in our body 2 3 who prescribed guidelines for each and every contaminant in aquatic system the dye industries generate significant amount of wastewater which after partial or no treatment are discharged over soil or water bodies causing pollution to the natural environment importantly most of these dyes are carcinogenic in nature and directly affects our life till date there are no rules and regulations to control over the use and discharge of different dye contaminated wastewater crystal violet cv dye one of the widely used dyes in textile industries is known for its mutagenic and mitotic poisoning nature it is carcinogen and acute cv causes serious eye damage and very toxic to aquatic life with long lasting effects 4 6 different techniques have been proposed and are being in use to remove theses toxic dyes from the aquatic system with limitations adsorption precipitation electro coagulation chemical oxidation photodegradation are some of the widely used developed techniques to remove the dyes from the dye bearing wastewater 4 6 among the developed techniques adsorption and photodegradation were found to be popularly adopted as used precursors are re usable and recyclable after desorption with suitable solvent presently the semiconducting materials are used either in solo or as composite doped hybrid where they act as adsorbent to adsorb solutes and also as photocatalyst to degrade the contaminants pollutants dye s from aquatic system 7 9 semiconducting materials are non toxic eco friendly and cheap titanium dioxide tio2 in this regard is one of the best and common semiconducting materials used for its low band gap of 3 2 ev although few doped tio2 materials were also reported the white solid metal oxide tio2 acts as a good adsorbent and because of its photocatalytic property conducts the electronic transition from the lower stable valence band vb to the high energetic empty conduction band cb to mineralise the dye molecules in the presence of uv radiation and oxygen in the suspension 10 13 tio2 as purchased commercially has been utilized by many researchers to remove the different organics dyes from the aqueous medium extensive studies were also conducted on the synthesis and characterization of titanate nanotube tnt or doped tnt 14 19 it can be noted that the doped or composite materials have greater efficiency towards the contaminants however in long run these materials may leach and join the effluent necessitating post treatment moreover these composite materials are difficult to synthesize and is also considered to be costly for day to day use activated carbon is superior adsorbent for any kind of contaminants but does not have any band gap for the conduction of electron form vb to cb for photodegradation of organics this activated carbon is also costly as compared to tio2 or tnt the studies conducted on tnt mainly focussed on evaluation of the adsorption photodegradation potential of tnt for removal of the dyes 14 however extensive elaborate studies on dye s removal using tnt as adsorbent as well as photocatalyst is lacking the present study is conducted to utilize hydrothermally synthesized titanate nanotubes tnts for removal of cv from spiked wastewater samples with the following specific objectives hydrothermal synthesization and characterization of titanate nanotubes tnts by xrd sem edx and tem evaluation of effect of the contact time dose of tnts concentration of

from the uv light source of wavelength 360 nm and power 18 w uv c made in germany the total set up was covered with a black cloth in order to protect the emission of hazardous uv rays to the surrounding fig 1 2 3 synthesis of tnt tnt was hydrothermally synthesized following the earlier published work 14 16 typically in a beaker 25 gg of p 25 tio2 powder was blended with 100 ml aqueous naoh 10 m solution the mixture was then subjected to continuous stirring 520 540 rpm for 1 h using an electrically operated magnetic stirrer remi 2mlh the mixture was then kept in a hydrothermal unit of stainless steel teflon lined autoclave for the hydrothermal treatment the mixture in the autoclave was heated to 150 160 c for a prescribed period of 24 h using a hot air oven and finally cooled to room temperature the final product in the autoclave was repeatedly washed with double distilled water with the aim of achieving the neutral ph of 7 finally the white solid was centrifuged 9000 rpm for 10 min to separate tnt and dried at 80 c for 6 h in a hot air oven and kept in a dry black box under dark condition for further use for adsorption photodegradation of organic dye cv from aqueous media the as prepared tnt was characterised instrumentally with tem xrd sem edx after synthesis of tnt the dried material was treated with dilute acid hcl 10 2 m below ph 2 1 h interval with 6 times 3 g tnt 10 ml solution which may help to replace na by h the acid treated suspension was repeatedly washed in double distilled water after each time of acid treatment after achieving ph 7 suspension was centrifuged and dried as mentioned and characterised called htnt 14 17 2 4 adsorption photocatalytic degradation of dye in the present work the adsorptive photocatalytic activity of both synthesized tnt and htnt were studied to remove toxic organic dye cv from aqueous media applying the same conditions the adsorption study was conducted in absence of uv light and the photodegradation study was understood by uv irradiation in the experiment 3 g l dose of as prepared tnt htnt was dispersed in 50 ml of synthetic cv solution taking in a 500 ml beaker 55 44 cm2 bed height from light source to the surface of the solution is 13 2 cm with an initial dye concentration of 20 mg l and at a ph of 6 8 0 2 the suspension was then put on the magnetic stirrer remi 2 mlh under a photocatalytic reactor fig 1 initially the adsorption study was conducted in the absence of uv light after getting an equilibrium point of adsorption the same suspension was then photo irradiated by uv illumination an 18 w 360 nm uv lamp was used as the light source the aqueous system of suspension was oxygenated to ensure the system had enough oxygen by aging at 520 540 rpm with a magnetic needle the experiment was conducted at room temperature 25 2 c the total adsorption and uv irradiation time followed was 6 h 2 0 4 0 h the suspension was then centrifuged remi r 24 at 9000 rpm for 10 min in order to separate the solid and liquid phase from the experimental solutions the supernatant liquid was collected after centrifugation and the remaining dye concentration in the supernatant was measured by using uv vis spectrophotometer at 587 nm it is important to mention here that during the time of adsorption of dye on tnt sbet 187 m2 g in dark condition absence of uv light the dye might have a little chance to degrade in the presence of ir however as degradation due to ir is a very slow process it is considered here predominantly adsorption process occurred the supernatant aliquot was carefully collected after centrifugation with a 1000 ml micropipette and the residual dye concentration was measured study was also conducted by varying the surface area of the solution 113 08 cm2 and 38 50 cm2 keeping the distance between the surface of the solution and the light source same the obtained results showed almost no effect on dye degradation 5 it is because each and every time the number of precursor s site and chemical moiety is same the experiments were also conducted with shorter wavelength 254 nm it has been observed that the volume of the contaminant solution is reduced to 40 ml initial solution was 50 ml shorter wavelength of the light transfers high energy which ultimately reduces the volume of the solution 3 results and discussion 3 1 analytical procedure a standard calibration curve of cv λmax 587 nm was drawn taking the concentrations in the range of 0 20 mg l air as blank the linear equation of the calibration curve is absorbance y 0 095x mg l 0 01 the specific relation co efficient r2 0 998 this linear equation was used for further quantification of dye concentrations remaining in the effluent 3 2 synthesis of titanate nanotubes synthesis of tnt from commercially available tio2 powder is well known 14 16 it is believed that treatment of tio2 with strong aqueous solution of naoh the positive charge na is encapsulated in between the edge shared of tio6 and octahedral layers of na2ti3o7 in this critical situation a positive strong generated static attractive force holds na and tio6 units tightly together prohibiting the rolling of these layers into the nanotubes in hydrothermal treatment over a period of time na gradually gets un encapsulated with intercalated h2o molecules into the interlayer space of tio6 sheets larger size of h2o molecule than na helps in enlargement of interlayer distance during na un encapsulation weakening attractive static interaction force existing between tio6 and octahedral layers finally layered na2ti3o7 particle gradually exfoliates to form numerous sheet shaped products 18 19 and finally rolls to nanotubes the nanotubes formation mechanism is shown in fig 2 14 20 21 xrd sem edx studies were performed in order to characterize the as prepared tnt and htnt 3 3 characterisation of tnt the evaluation of phase and structure of the synthesized samples was carried out using an x ray diffractometer shimazdu xrd 6100 with cu kα radiation of wavelength λ 0 15406 nm in the scan range 2θ 20 80 with a data acquisition rate of 0 033 per step nanostructured titanate materials produced by alkaline hydrothermal treatment are not amorphous and have well defined crystalline structures however there are several controversial issues regarding the exact crystal structure of nanostructured titanate materials synthesized by alkaline hydrothermal treatment 14 21 firstly for protonated forms of polytitanic acids h 2m ti n o 2n m as well as for pure tio2 a lot of cyrstal modifications are reported further during the formation of nanotube structures wrapping along a certain crystallographic axis results in the widening of peaks along this direction and therefore assigning miller indices to those peaks are difficult in addition to that the titanate nanotubes are relatively unstable and can easily undergo phase transformation during heating acid treatment or other chemical treatments during or after preparation of nanotubes 14 17 the x ray diffraction xrd pattern of two samples has been measured in order to determine the crystalline phases present in the nanostructures the xrd pattern of sample 1 tnt and sample 2 htnt are shown in fig 3 it has been observed that both the samples do not contain any rutile or anatase phase of tio2 further similar types of diffraction peaks are present in both the samples except a little change in intensity the diffraction peaks of the samples can be correlated with a2ti n o2 n 1 crystallographic series with n 5 and a h na 17 after removing the sodium from sample 1 by hcl h2o washing no additional peaks in the xrd pattern appeared except a little change in intensity for all the peaks as compared to that of sample 1 in the present study it has been observed that the xrd pattern of sample 2 matches fairly well with the monoclinic c2 m h2ti5o11 h2o structure jcpdf 00 044 0131 these results suggest that sample 2 originates from sodium titanate phase a comparison of the observed 2θ values in degree and interplanar spacing dhkl along with the standard values are summarised in table 1 sem edx study was conducted using fei sem apreo lovac for both tnt and htnt however with some impurities the main composition of the synthesized precursors was found to be the titanium as p 25 is 99 pure the sorret bands as obtained are shown in fig 4 a and b the shape and size of the synthesized precursor did not clear from the obtained sem image and showed the amorphous one fig 5 shows the tem image of tnt only which shows the clear image of the formation of tnt with a diameter of 50 nm 3 4 effect of contact time contact time between the solute and sorbent is one of the important parameters which enable us to know the boundary condition between the two components to achieve the saturation point of the uptaking of solute on sorbent surface although it will depend on the nature of solute and sorbent the study was conducted in two steps i e i adsorption and photodegradation 2 h without uv light and 4 h with uv light and ii photodegradation only 6 h photo irradiation with uv light where the dose of tnt cv ph and stirring speed were 3 g l 20 mg l 6 8 0 2 and 520 540 rpm respectively optimal conditions in the first step adsorption saturation point was achieved after 2 h fig 6 where the maximum removal of cv was obtained 80 after then due to the photodegradation of cv in presence of photocatalyst tnt the removal was 95 this can be explained by stating that adsorption efficiency is increased till the numbers of available adsorbent sites are active remaining minimum numbers of photocatalyst tnt sites which are not exposed in adsorption process may have the chance to degrade the solute in the presence of uv light and adequate amount of oxygen by transfer of electron s from vb to cb of the semiconductor photocatalyst in the second step i e in the presence of uv light only at the beginning rate of removal efficiency of cv was high and then suppressed the obtained results may be due to the presence of fresh tnt photocatalyst surfaces and also due to the simultaneously adsorption and photodegradation photoadsorption of the solute molecules as the fresh and active sites are slowly exhausted photodegradation also suppressed the study has also been conducted in the presence of bright sunlight in a bright sunny day the results revealed that sunlight has a degradation efficiency 20 of uv light in order to investigate the mechanism of solute adsorption on to the adsorbent pseudo second order reaction model 22 based on the solid phase sorption was analysed the linearized form of pseudo second order reaction model can be written as 1 t q t 1 h 1 q e t h initial sorption rate constant k qe 2 linear plot of t qt vs time t confirms that the reaction rate followed pseudo second order kinetics fig 7 and was concluded by confining the specific relation co efficient value r2 0 9997 3 5 effect of dose a series of experiments were conducted in order to determine the dose of the prepared precursor to achieve the maximum removal efficiency of dye from the aqueous media which is one of the prime parameters of this study the dose was varied in the range of 1 5 g l fig 8 keeping the cv concentration at 20 mg l dye removal mechanism from wastewater on tnt surfaces followed both adsorption in absence of light and then photodegradation in presence of uv light to achieve the maximum removal percentage increasing the doses of the precursors the overall removal efficiency degradation of cv increased due to increment of the active positive precursor s sites leading to more degradation of the chemical moiety of the hydrophilic cv initially after achieving the equilibrium point of adsorption in dark 80 2 0 h the suspension was then allowed to photo irradiated for another 4 0 h to achieve the final 95 removal hence the total time for both the mechanisms elapsed was 6 0 h 2 0 h 4 0 h during photodegradation increment of precursor sites accelerates the photon absorption from the light source causing the higher photoadsorption photo degradation efficiency of the chemical moiety however it has been observed that 3 g l dose of tnt was efficient to remove 95 dye from aquatic system it is worth to mention here that under the same experimental conditions both the precursors i e tnt and htnt have the equal removal efficiency towards cv hence the entire studies were conducted using tnt only 3 6 concentration variation keeping the dose of tnt 3 g l agitation time 6 h photodegradation ph 6 8 0 2 and temperature 25 2 c fixed the study was conducted by varying dye concentrations in the range of 10 40 mg l the results of the concentration variation study are presented in fig 9 it can be observed that removal efficiency of the precursors suppressed from 98s to 70 with increase in the concentration of cv this result was not contradictory as the precursor s sites are constant and fixed with respect to the increment of chemical moieties 3 7 effect of ph on cv removal in the present study ph was varied between 2 0 and 10 0 to evaluate its effect on the removal efficiency of cv for any particular ph the study followed two steps viz adsorption without uv light 2 h and photodegradation 4 h keeping all other experimental conditions fixed fig 10 shows the decreasing efficiency of cv adsorption degradation on tnt with increasing or decreasing ph of the media however we conducted the entire studies at a ph of 6 8 0 2 the ph of double distilled water the dye structure is completely ph dependent hence the different structured organic moiety may have different affinity towards tnt surfaces similar results have also been reported earlier 23 again it may be explained with the surface charge of tnt i e phzpc the phzpc of tnt was determined to be 8 04 indicating zero surface charge the adsorption of cationic cv on tnt in the experimental ph 6 8 0 2 is not a spontaneous one and has also been proved by the calculation of free energy change δg o of the process again the suppression in removal efficiency of cv with increasing or decreasing ph of the media may be due to the different structural property of cv 3 8 isotherm study it is important to investigate the amount of solute sorbed at constant temperature on a particular amount of sorbent in this study we had conducted both the langmuir and freuindlich isotherms at 25 2 c to understand the sportive behaviour of tnt towards cv with dose variation 1 0 3 0 g l and at a constant cv concentration of 20 mg l the larger hydrophilic groups tend to adsorbed on to tnt surfaces without uv light and further immobilized to aqueous environment the linearized langmuir isotherm was drawn fig 11 a by plotting 1 qe vs 1 ce using the following equation as follows 24 2 1 q e 1 q max 1 b q max 1 c e where qe is the amount of adsorbate on adsorbent surfaces at equilibrium mg g qmax is the maximum adsorption capacity mg g ce is the equilibrium concentration mg l b is constant related to energy of the adsorption system l mg the linearized equation obtained as 1 qe 0 3499 1 ce 0 1196 the specific relation co efficient r2 was found to be 0 9772 the maximum adsorptive capacity qmax was calculated to be 8 361 mg cv g tnt the linearized freuindlich isotherm fig 11 b was drawn by plotting lnqe vs lnce using the following equation as follows 25 3 ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e where kf is the freuindlich constant related to adsorption capacity 1 n is the adsorption intensity the linearized equation obtained as lnqe 0 2810 lnce 1 2198 the specific relation co efficient r2 was found to be 0 9849 the maximum adsorptive capacity kf was calculated to be 3 387 mg cv g tnt the adsorption intensity n was found to be 3 56 this high of value n 1 reflects high affinity of cv towards tnt specific relation co efficient values of both isotherms suggested the adsorption model follows the freuindlich isotherm in a little better way than langmuir table 2 dimensionless equilibrium parameter rl was evaluated using the following equation the value was important to understand whether the langmuir adsorption is favourable or unfavourable for cv on synthesized precursor 4 r l 1 1 b c 0 where co is the initial cv concentration mg l and b is the langmuir isotherm constant table 2 rl 1 indicates that adsorption is favourable whereas rl 1 means that adsorption is unfavourable the value of rl for an initial cv concentration of 20 mg l was 0 13 indicating that adsorption is favourable 26 27 the following equation calculates the standard gibbs free energy changes δg o for the adsorption process 5 ln 1 b δ g o r t where b table 2 is the langmuir isotherm constant r is the universal gas constant 8 3145 j mol 1 k 1 and t is the absolute temperature positive δg o value 2 673 kj mol indicates the cv adsorption on tnt is not a spontaneous process 26 28 it may be attributed to the larger sized organic moiety of cv dubinin radushkevich d r isotherm was drawn by plotting lnq vs ε 2 fig 11 c in order to understand the mechanisms of adsorption on to tnt i e physisorption or chemisorptions using the following linear equation 26 27 29 30 6 ln q ln q m k ε 2 where ε polanyi potentiali rt ln 1 1 ce q is amount of cv adsorbed per unit weight of adsorbent mg g qm is adsorption capacity 11 00 mg cv g tnt k is a constant related to adsorption energy r is the universal gas constant t is the absolute temperature k the mean free energy of adsorption e defined as free energy change when one mole of ion is transferred from infinity in solution to the surface of the solid was calculated from the k value using the equation 7 e 2 k 0 5 the calculated e value 3 829 kj mole indicates the adsorption of cv onto tnt is of physisorption as the obtained value is lower than 8 kj mole 26 27 29 30 3 9 effect of co existing ions real dye s bearing sample contains different types of co existing ions hence the study was conducted in the presence of different coexisting foreign ions in the aquatic system to find out their affect on cv removal if any the complete photodegradation studies were conducted in the optimal conditions cv degradation efficiency gradually decreased in the presence of calcium chloride sulphate and nitrate anions table 3 in the range of 50 400 mg l again the same results have also been observed for the other ions of silicate phosphate and the rare presence of edta at concentrations ranging from 0 to 30 mg l table 4 however drastic suppression rate was observed for calcium the same trend was also observed for the presence of fe ii in the concentration of only 0 5 mg l this attributed result may be explained by the fact that salts of each ion may have chance to coat on to tnt surfaces causing the prohibition of electronic transfer mineralize the solute dye 23 3 10 empirical formulation for adsorption process the experiments performed to determine the percent of removal of dye may be empirically expressed in the form of differential equation as 8 p d p c p t v 2 w 1 d p d w 2 c p c w 3 t p t p d p c p t 3 z 1 d 2 p d z 2 c 2 p c z 3 t 2 p t p d p c p t 1 d 5 10 c 40 0 5 t 6 5 where p d c and t are the percentage of removal dose of tnt g l concentration of violet dye ppm and time h of contact respectively and w 1 w 2 w 3 z 1 z 2 z 3 v are constants subjected to the constraints of operation the variables d c and t are independent of one another the system proposed in this paper shall always be optimized at a particular set of variables d c t the eq 8 is valid for the specific optimized set of variables since the equation has been framed based on our experimental results it can act as a fundamental equation for the complex cases of simultaneous changes in more than one variable instead of one however with appropriate boundary conditions 31 the equation can be solved either computationally or analytically if the boundary equations are simpler as in our case this further provides an idea of the trend of variation in percentage of dye removal with respect to its independent variables the constants for variations in the variables are tabulated here where c 1 c 2 and c 3 are constants of integration for d c and t the constant values are shown in table 5 the optimized set of variables for tnt dose concentration of cv and the adsorption time were found to be 3 g l 20 mg l and 2 h respectively 3 11 probable mechanism under uv irradiation the activated cv molecules dye were converted into short lived active transient free radical species on contacting with tnt surfaces transferring the produced negative charged electron s on it this produced electron s can be injected into the conduction band of tnt connected through the nanotube channels 32 this injective process could also be directly performed by radical dye molecules 33 the injected electrons were captured by the surface adsorbed o2 molecules to yield o2 and ho radical among others finally the dye molecules could be quickly mineralized by the radicals the probable photo degradation mechanism of dye under uv light using tnt is shown as follows 34 and the probable scheme of adsorption and photodegradation is shown in fig 12 9 dye hν dye 10 dye tnt dye tnt e 11 tnt e o2 tnt o2 12 o2 tnt e 2h h2o2 13 h2o2 tnt e oh oh 14 dye o2 or o2 or oh peroxylated or hydroxylated intermediates degraded or mineralized products 3 12 turn over study the turn over study is conducted to understand the re usability of the used and exhausted materials after the end of first cycle of experiment the exhausted material produced 2 g was repeatedly washed using 100 ethyl alcohol till to recover the 90 of adsorbed cv finally the desorbed material was washed in double distilled water and dried at 80 c in hot air oven for 6 h following the similar way two times of turn over studies were conducted in the same experimental conditions photodegradation the experimental results revealed the suppression of dye photoadsorption degradation in each cycle 76 62 the obtained experimental results may be due to the unavailability of the fresh and active sites of the precursors and blocking of the sites due to the presence of dye molecules on the precursor surfaces inhibiting the electronic transfer to the cb from the vb to mineralise the solute molecules 4 application to spiked real water sample tap water was collected from the environment engineering lab of kiit deemed to be university and pond water was collected from the pond near to the kiss university cv at the rate of 20 mg l was spiked both in the tap and pond water the adsorbent dose was used as 3 g l the adsorption degradation experiments were carried out at 25 2 c and at an agitation speed of 520 540 rpm the obtained results revealed that 3 g l dose of adsorbent efficiently removed 75 of cv in both the cases table 6 shows the water quality of tap and pond water before and after treatment the obtained result may be useful for the practical purposes it is worth to mention here that uv rays can kill the pathogens present if any in the water sample which is also an important parameter to maintain the water quality 5 comparative study with other methods of removal of cv there have many research works conducted for the removal of cv from aqueous medium 35 40 the major findings of the previously conducted research work and the present study are reported in table 7 it can be noted from the table that in the previous studies on removal of cv mostly biological or natural adsorbents were used further it can be observed that the material efficiency of clay rubber seed moroccan pyrophyllite and anatolian black pine are better than the tnt used in the present study these precursor materials mainly acted as adsorbents and with higher specific surface areas than tnt performed better in adsorption than tnt however use of tnt as an adsorbent as well as photocatalyst performed two significant roles at a time tnt not only removed the pollutants through adsorption and photodegradation but also ensured the destruction of pathogens in the wastewater by photodegradation it is strongly believed that the current technique of removal of cv using tnt will prove to be a better one than the other existing methods in the long run as tnt is cheaply available highly abundant possess strong oxidative power disinfecting power and has high structural and chemical stability 6 conclusions titanate nanotubes tnts were hydrothermally synthesized and characterized by sem edx and tem the crystallography of tnt was understood by xrd these hydrothermally synthesized tnts were used to remove crystal violet cv from the spiked synthetic water the cv removal from the aquatic system followed two kinds of mechanism i e adsorption and photodegradation it was observed that 3 g l dose of the semiconductor photocatalyst tnt was efficient to remove 95 final of cv from the water medium at room temperature and at a ph of 6 8 0 2 with the shaking speed of 520 20 rpm the adsorptive capacity of tnt and feasibility of the adsorption process was evaluated from the langmuir and d r isotherms reaction mechanism followed the pseudo second order kinetics ph variation of the medium indicated the suppression of cv removal which was also observed in the presence of co existing ions in the medium the adsorption process was empirically formulated with the variation dose time and initial dye concentration turnover study showed suppressed removal efficiency of the regenerated exhausted material the probable photodegradation mechanism of the dye was also proposed finally the technique was applied to remove cv from spiked tap water and pond water separately
