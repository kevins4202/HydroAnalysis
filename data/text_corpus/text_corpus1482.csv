7410,increasing urbanization augments impervious surface area which results in increased run off volumes and peak flows green infrastructure gi approaches are a decentralized alternative for sustainable urban stormwater and provide an array of ecosystem services and foster community building by enhancing neighborhood aesthetics increasing property value and providing shared green spaces while projects involving sustainability concepts and environmental design are favored in privileged communities marginalized communities have historically been located in areas that suffer from environmental degradation underprivileged communities typically do not receive as many social and environmental services as advantaged communities this research explores gi based management strategies that are evaluated at the watershed scale to improve hydrological performance by mitigating storm water run off volumes and peak flows gi deployment strategies are developed to address environmental justice issues by prioritizing placement in communities that are underprivileged and locations with high outreach potential a hydrologic hydraulic stormwater model is developed using the storm water management model swmm 5 1 to simulate the impacts of alternative management strategies management scenarios include the implementation of rain water harvesting in private households the decentralized implementation of bioretention cells in private households the centralized implementation of bioretention cells in municipally owned vacant land and combinations of those strategies realities of implementing gi on private and public lands are taken into account to simulate various levels of coverage and routing for bioretention cell scenarios the effects of these strategies are measured by the volumetric reduction of run off and reduction in peak flow social benefits are not evaluated this approach is applied in an underprivileged community within the walnut creek watershed in raleigh north carolina keywords urban stormwater low impact development hydrologic hydraulic modeling environmental justice bioretention cells rainwater harvesting 1 introduction land use change associated with rapid urbanization increases the amount of impervious surface and generates high runoff volumes and flow rates which overwhelm traditional centralized drainage systems overflow of stormwater sewers degrades stream health damages infrastructure systems and creates safety hazards residents industries and municipalities bear the economic burden of mitigating increased flooding and erosion best management practices bmps low impact development lid and green infrastructure gi are now grouped under the umbrella term stormwater control measures scms which include both structural and non structural strategies to mitigate flooding and conserve water through decentralized solutions national research council 2008 fletcher et al 2014 gi manages stormwater through the onsite treatment of runoff and mimics the natural hydrological behavior of pre developed urban environments applied on a broad scale gi can maintain or restore a watershed s hydrologic and ecological functions usepa 2012 eckart et al 2017 gi practices such as green roofs rainwater harvesting rain gardens and pervious pavements mimic nature by controlling stormwater close to the source of runoff generation and research demonstrates that widespread gi implementation across a watershed can significantly improve flashy hydrology by reducing peak flows the frequency of runoff events and variability in runoff compared to grey infrastructure pennino et al 2016 li et al 2017 in addition gi improves air and water quality urban heat island effects property values and public health wang et al 2013 and is typically more cost effective than equivalent grey infrastructure usepa 2014 while gi has been successfully deployed through a range of programs from small scale demonstrations to notable efforts like the green alley program in chicago chicago department of transportation 2007 and the green city clean waters program in philadelphia philadelphia water department 2011 the wide adoption of these approaches on a large scale has been neglected for a number of reasons stakeholders and municipalities remain uncertain about the efficiency of gi to mitigate stormwater while some research has explored the effectiveness of gi to reduce stormwater in small catchments shuster and rhea 2013 jarden et al 2016 walsh et al 2014 york et al 2015 petrucci et al 2012 vargas 2009 jones and hunt 2010 jensen et al 2010 catchment level studies that evaluated rainwater harvesting systems rwhs and bioretention cells found a wide array of possible outcomes walsh et al 2014 petrucci et al 2012 york et al 2015 barich 2014 masi 2011 only a limited set of studies have explored their efficacy at a watershed scale hood et al 2007 damodaram et al 2010 line et al 2012 ahiablame et al 2013 bedan and clausen 2009 gi technologies are decentralized solutions and wide scale gi implementation across a watershed and community is needed to attain flood abatement eckart et al 2017 small scale projects that are not duplicated throughout a watershed will have limited effects on runoff reduction a substantial amount of impervious area is located on private residences where access is limited for implementing infrastructure and gi programs must engage communities to extend the benefits of gi equitably among diverse groups across watersheds doberstein et al 2010 roy et al 2008 members of marginalized and mixed income neighborhoods have been historically overlooked by policymakers and frequently excluded from environmental decision making processes they may not engage in gi initiatives due to perceptions about the distribution of costs and benefits distrust of local government prioritization of other household needs and transience of residence in the affected neighborhood baptiste et al 2015 barnhill and smardon 2012 perceptions and uncertainty among constituents cannot be easily allayed because the costs of ecosystem service degradation have been disproportionately felt by poor and non white communities in the past sanchez et al 2014 2015 norman et al 2012 while watershed restoration projects have been implemented more often in affluent neighborhoods dernoga et al 2015 perreault et al 2012 the objective of this research is to develop an integrated approach to prioritize placement of gi strategies within marginalized communities and evaluate watershed wide effectiveness of gi we apply the approach to explore the effect of bioretention cells and rwhs on runoff mitigation by conducting a set of simulation experiments for a watershed first a geospatial approach is developed to prioritize locations for placing gi that will benefit underprivileged communities and provide outreach opportunities the adoption of innovative gi practices is often hindered by uncertainty risk perceptions and limited or inaccurate knowledge olorunkiya et al 2012 beecher et al 2005 and familiarity can reduce perceptions of risk bowman and thompson 2009 and positively influence adoption rates and willingness to adopt gi practices stacy 2015 placing gi at locations with elevated foot traffic provides opportunities for sustained outreach the method presented here conducts spatial analysis of socioeconomic parameters to identify underprivileged communities and proximity to areas of high foot traffic to identify target locations for placing gi second gi strategies are developed to test a range of modeled settings that effect performance scenarios are constructed using various configurations of rwhs and bioretention cells with different levels of density levels and infrastructure characteristics to represent realistic limitations in adoption of gi and constraints on treating impervious surfaces a hydrologic and hydraulic model of the watershed is constructed to evaluate the effect of a range of gi strategies on runoff reduction impacts of bioretention cell deployment are assessed for both centralized municipally owned vacant land and decentralized e g private households scenarios results demonstrate the range of performance of gi approaches contextualized within a watershed for a range of realistic modeled settings this integrated approach to stormwater management is applied for the walnut creek watershed located in south raleigh in wake county north carolina 2 background on gi simulation this research focuses on simulating the effectiveness of bioretention cells and rwhs for improving stormwater management rwhs intercepts rooftop run off and can serve as a tool for decentralized water supply and management of storm water fletcher et al 2007 steffen et al 2013 while rwhs can have significant effects on reducing potable water demand jensen 2008 effects on runoff mitigation are typically marginal and large storage sizes are needed for effective stormwater control jones and hunt 2010 studies on the effects of rwhs on watershed hydrology show a wide arrange of possible outcomes walsh et al 2014 found that for a high density urban watershed a rwhs based management strategy has the potential to reduce the volume of stormwater run off by 10 4 using 50 gallon rain tanks and by 12 4 for 200 gallon rain tanks at full implementation capacity 100 watershed coverage in contrast petrucci et al 2012 found that with 33 3 watershed coverage and rain tank sizes of 0 6 m3 158 5 gallon and 0 8 m3 211 gallon hydrological impacts were negligible research indicates that systems with large storage capacity 200 1 000 gallon are most effective for stormwater management york et al 2015 though they may not be practical bioretention systems or rain gardens are commonly used in stormwater management of urbanizing watersheds liu et al 2014 davis et al 2010 the impacts of bioretention cell implementation at the watershed scale have not been explored extensively york et al 2015 and a limited number of studies have explored bioretention cells with varying results barich 2014 found run off volume reductions of 20 30 a study in the north creek watershed in illinois tetra tech 2012 found volume reductions after cell implementation of 50 and york et al 2015 observed minimal 1 reduction for an average year after moderate implementation of cells in the watershed these studies vary in watershed size percentage of impervious surface and level of implementation and as a result generalization of results is not possible studies that simulate bioretention cells have routed all impervious flows towards the cell masi 2011 barich 2014 this assumption is likely unrealistic particularly in watershed scale models where site selection is limited and cannot be analyzed on a case by case basis studies assessing the watershed scale impacts of bioretention cell implementation explore the implementation in municipally owned land york et al 2015 masi 2011 or consider the conversion of a percent of impervious surface in the watershed to gi without considering the ownership of the locations that are retrofitted barich 2014 this research compares the impacts of centralized municipally owned land and decentralized privately owned land management strategies none of the studies cited above address environmental justice by focusing on the selection of underprivileged areas for implementing these technologies 3 methods 3 1 selecting locations for gi placement analysis using a geographic information system gis is employed to identify preferred locations for the placement of gi infrastructure within a watershed these potentially ideal locations for the placement of gi infrastructure are selected using two criteria socioeconomic status and outreach potential target locations for gi implementation are socioeconomically underprivileged or marginalized communities socioeconomically underprivileged distressed or disadvantaged areas are identified by joining areas with the following attributes high and owen 2014 average unemployment rate is 50 greater than the state average unemployment rate annual per capita income is one third lower than the state average annual per capita income and average poverty rate is 50 greater than the state average poverty rate tabular data is joined to relate it to the spatial census block group data and new shapefiles of unemployment per capita income and poverty rate categories are created census blocks meeting the three criteria that define underprivileged communities are selected from the resulting shapefiles the second selection criterion outreach potential offers the opportunity to expose and familiarize the public with gi infrastructure high impact areas are identified as areas in which elevated foot traffic facilitates exposure to gi infrastructure so that the public becomes more familiar with these practices places of interest such as schools churches libraries supermarkets and post offices are identified and the surrounding 152 4 m 500 ft radius area is defined as a high impact area high impact areas that are in underprivileged areas are classified as preferred gi locations bioretention cells can be placed in public private and vacant land rwhs can be placed in private residential property commercial businesses and institutional facilities 3 2 hydrologic modeling the environmental protection agency storm water management model swmm 5 1 usepa 2015 is used in this research to model the hydrological and hydraulic behavior of the catchment swmm is a dynamic rainfall runoff model that estimates combined sewer overflows runoff volumes and velocity generated by rainfall events swmm is open ware non proprietary and designed primarily to model urban areas swmm 5 1 allows explicit simulation of gi infrastructure gi can be placed in an existing subcatchment or be demarcated as a new subcatchment covered by gi infrastructure when gi structures are modeled as individual subcatchments the subcatchment s properties such as area slope curve number or imperviousness are encoded as those of the gi usepa 2015 gi implementation reduces the percentage of impervious surface and a fraction of the run off can be rerouted to pervious areas further reducing the runoff volume received by the gi 4 case study walnut creek wetland watershed the selected area of study lies within the walnut creek watershed which is part of the neuse river basin in central north carolina located in wake county the walnut creek watershed extends from the town of cary in the west throughout the south of the city of raleigh until it reaches the neuse river on its east end fig 1 the walnut creek watershed hydrologic unit code 030202011101 has a total surface area of almost 121 km2 and over 467 km of stream the watershed has the highest percentage of land covered by urban land uses in the neuse river basin and with a projected population increase of 40 in wake county for the year 2035 rapid urbanization and increase of impervious surface is expected north carolina office of state budget and management 2015 a total of 66 8 of the watershed is currently developed the average annual precipitation in the walnut creek watershed is 40 5 in precipitation is fairly evenly distributed through the year and the average difference in rainfall between the driest month january and wettest month september is 5 62 in the main branch of the walnut creek watershed the walnut creek is a lazy or slow running urban creek when heavy rain occurs there is flooding along the banks development along the creek has accentuated flooding problems and threatens the water quality of the creek and the receiving body which is the neuse river ncsu 2000 areas of the walnut creek watershed are located in underprivileged communities with a predominantly african american racial makeup and have been significantly affected by repeated flooding rochester heights neighborhood is the first african american housing development in raleigh and is built partly within the walnut creek floodplain rochester heights has been historically neglected and environmentally impaired raw sewage was discharged into walnut creek next to the subdivision up until the 1960s and until recently the community and the wetland area was commonly used as a dumping facility the natural learning initiative 2002 due to frequent flooding events residents were charged by the city of raleigh for stormwater management services despite the faulty conditions of the drainage system in contrast residents of more privileged areas suffering the same flooding events were not charged for the same services ncsu 2000 in the mid 1990s a grassroots group of stakeholders community leaders and advocates formed the partners for environmental justice pej whose goal was to promote the growth and quality of life of southeast raleigh this group focused on the conservation and restoration of 0 198 km2 of wetlands in southeast raleigh and created the walnut creek urban wetlands educational park which resolved some flooding issues in the area and improved the environmental health of the wetland area in addition the park provided a healthy wildlife habitat beautified a neglected area of the city of raleigh and created a recreational resource for the residents of the surrounding areas while serving as an environmental outreach and educational opportunity the natural learning initiative 2002 flooding issues and environmental disparity persist in this area however and the health of walnut creek may improve from the multiple benefits that gi approaches bring to urban communities in the face of climate change population increase and rapid urbanization gi approaches may be a critical component of revitalization projects detwiler 2012 4 1 selection of preferred locations for gi placement analysis using gis is employed to identify preferred locations for the placement of gi preferred locations are those that are located in socioeconomically underprivileged communities within the watershed and intersect with high impact locations census data was obtained at the block group level from the national historical geographic information system minnesota population center 2011 for 2010 2014 according to the united states census bureau and the 2010 2014 american community survey 5 year estimates the state unemployment rate is 6 6 the state per capita income is 25 608 and the state poverty rate is 17 6 united states census bureau 2015 communities that are underprivileged are characterized by an unemployment rate of 9 9 or greater a per capita income lower than 17 072 and a poverty rate of at least 26 4 these areas are shown in fig 2 high impact areas are defined here as areas in which elevated foot traffic facilitates exposure to gi so that the public becomes more familiar with these practices places of interest such as schools churches libraries supermarkets and post offices are identified and the surrounding 152 4 m radius is used to define high impact areas fig 1 data were collected from the wake county gis service wake county gis service 2016 preferred locations fig 1 are the areas where high impact areas overlap with underprivileged areas fig 1 analysis shows that a large percentage of the potential sites for gi implementation are located in southeast raleigh in the vicinity of rochester heights neighborhood 4 2 catchment selection the area selected for hydrologic modeling and simulation is the area draining to the inlet of the walnut creek wetlands or the walnut creek wetland watershed wcww shown as a blue line in figs 1 and 2 although historic flow data is not available for this catchment and there is no monitored flow at the outlet the catchment is selected based on the methodology described above for prioritizing high density of preferred gi locations additionally there is considerable community level interest in this area as demonstrated through development of the pej and new data about watershed modeling and gi performance can be shared with engaged stakeholders through the walnut creek wetland community project water resources research institute of the unc system 2017 catchment delineation is performed using archydro maidment 2002 for a raw digital elevation model obtained from the north carolina floodplain mapping program ncfmp 2017 the wcww covers 2 54 km2 and has a percentage of imperviousness of 36 5 which was calculated using the land use map of imperviousness from the national land cover database xian et al 2011 suitable locations for the implementation of bioretention cells and rwhs are selected from preferred gi locations fig 2 according to the specific requirements of these different practices bioretention cells can be placed in either public or private open space or vacant land rwhs can be placed in private residential property and commercial and institutional facilities there are 0 27 km2 of vacant land available for placement of bioretention cells and 1 222 households with potential for rwhs or small size bioretention cells 4 3 swmm model 4 3 1 subcatchments the catchment of study is discretized into 28 smaller subcatchments according to land use overland flow path and draining direction subcatchments are defined in terms of area imperviousness flow path length width and slope shapefiles from the national land cover database homer et al 2015 are used to estimate the total watershed imperviousness at 36 53 this approach typically underestimates imperviousness and based on visual analysis of orthophotos total imperviousness in the watershed is estimated as 64 9 with values for individual subcatchments ranging from 22 4 to 100 directly connected impervious area dcia is considered the primary contributor of stormwater runoff during small rain events 2 54 cm or 1 in walsh 2000 walsh 2004 flint and davis 2007 and is used for imperviousness in swmm using the wenger method wenger et al 2008 3 dcia 1 046 tia 6 23 archydro and digital elevation models are used to find flow direction and width of subcatchments width is calculated as the subcatchment area divided by the flow path length which is calculated as the area weighted average of longest overland flows in natural and urban areas flow path length is estimated as 152 4 m for undeveloped areas and as the distance from the back of a representative lot to the middle of the street for residential lots slope was assumed as 2 in impervious land and for pervious areas overland slope was calculated from topographical elevation data and overland flow length the subcatchment slope was subsequently calculated again as an area weighted average subcatchment slope values range from 0 03 to 6 9 infiltration was calculated using the green ampt method with parameters for sandy loam which is the soil type throughout the wcww other parameters were used based on recommendations from the swmm user s manual usepa 2015 table 1 4 3 2 drainage network the storm water drainage network for each subcatchment is modeled in swmm data was obtained in the form of gis shapefiles provided from the city of raleigh stormwater management division b hinkle personal communication august 2015 with characterization for geometries and lengths of pipes junctions bridges swales and open channels the network is represented by 73 drainage elements which make up the main stems of the piping system and open or natural channels invert elevations were estimated from topographical information and a cover depth of 0 92 m 3 ft was added to the invert elevation for each closed conduit conduit roughness manning s roughness coefficient was set as 0 013 for circular concrete pipes as 0 02 for trapezoidal concrete lined channels asce 1992 and as 0 05 for natural channels usepa 2015 based on visual inspection of open channels they were characterized as trapezoidal with a maximum depth of 0 92 m 3 ft and a bottom width of 3 66 m 12 ft 4 3 3 rainwater harvesting systems rwhs units were modeled using the swmm lid editor which reduces error in predicted runoff volumes compared to the cumulative storage depression storage method walsh et al 2014 in this study two rwhs capacities are assessed 50 gallon 189 3 l and 200 gallon 757 1 l corresponding footprint areas are 0 27 m2 2 89 ft2 and 0 66 m2 7 07 ft2 respectively the smaller design ensures viability in every residence despite lot size restrictions and prevents vector and water quality issues that emerge with longer drain times associated with larger cisterns walsh et al 2014 to account for the routing of precipitation from impervious surfaces e g rooftops to pervious surfaces e g lawns downpour disconnection is assumed and all outflow from rwhs is discharged to pervious areas drain delay is the number of dry hours that it takes for the rain barrel to be emptied through its drain and is set at 24 h rwhs units are simulated as empty at initialization for typical rwhs units only one side of the rooftop drains to the rwhs to represent this the percentage of impervious surface treated is simulated as 50 of the building footprint area the median building footprint in wcww is 131 m2 1 409 ft2 and the impervious surface area treated by each rwhs is as 704 ft2 specifications for each tank type are based on standard rain barrel designs in common retailers and include 58 4 cm 23 in diameter and 86 4 cm 34 in height for the 50 gallon tank and 91 4 cm 36 in diameter and 142 2 cm 56 in height for the 200 gallon tank acquabarrel 2016 overflow is 7 6 cm 3 in diameter and outlet height from the bottom is 1 9 cm 0 75 in for both designs flow rate per unit area of gi q is expressed in eq 1 in hr where c is a drain coefficient in hr h is the height of stored water in hd is the drain height over the bottom in and n is the drain exponent 1 q c h h d n where n is equal to 0 5 to represent an orifice the drain coefficient c or flow coefficient in swmm s lid editor is a function of the drain time t hr of a depth of stored water d in 2 c 2 d 1 2 t drain time is assumed as 24 h for a 50 gallon tank and 48 h for a 200 gallon tank resulting in values of 1 24 cm hr 0 49 in hr and 1 98 cm hr 0 78 in hr for c respectively 4 3 4 bioretention cells bioretention cells are simulated based on a number of inputs including soil characteristics saturated hydraulic conductivity average capillary suction and soil moisture deficit which are estimated based on the swmm user manual version 5 0 rossman 2010 media depth was set at 0 92 m 3 ft based on recommendations for 0 7 1 0 m 2 3 3 3 ft liu et al 2014 the percentage of impervious area treated or percentage of flows routed from impervious surfaces into the bioretention cell is calculated using eq 3 3 a imp treated a t a p a gi r where aimp treated is the area of the catchment that is treated through the use of the gi at is the total area of the catchment ap is the pervious area of the catchment and agi is the area covered by the bioretention cell r is the percentage of the impervious area that is routed to the gi for treatment variation in routing level is achieved through gi site placement which affects the percentage of the flow that is directed towards and captured by the bioretention cell the size of the bioretention cell must be specified by the modeler 4 4 gi simulation and management scenarios gi based managements scenarios are simulated in swmm 5 1 to evaluate the reduction of stormwater volumes and peak flows under different strategies summarized in table 2 deployment of rwhs is simulated at various density levels which refers to the percentage of households that implement rwhs at 10 25 40 and 100 density there are eight rwhs simulation scenarios deployment of bioretention cells is varied based on the size of the cell the average residential property size is 655 6 m2 and the mean yard area is 524 8 m2 bioretention cells that occupy 25 of the total yard size are estimated at 121 4 m2 0 03 acres additional scenarios evaluate bioretention cells of 242 8 m2 0 06 acres and 40 5 m2 0 01 acres decentralized or household level implementation of bioretention cells is simulated at watershed density levels of 10 25 40 and 100 which refers to the percentage of households that implement bioretention cells the three different bioretention cell sizes 0 01 0 03 and 0 06 acres are simulated at each density level previously conducted studies on the effect of bioretention cells assume total capture of runoff volumes from impervious surfaces by the bioretention cells masi 2011 barich 2014 in reality multiple limitations to this assumption may exist due to the layout of both private property and municipal impervious surfaces we assume that such limitations are persistent and that only a fraction of runoff volume can be captured by bioretention cells two routing levels of 25 and 40 are simulated for each density and sizing scenarios in total there are 24 decentralized bioretention management scenarios centralized bioretention cell scenarios are simulated at deployment density levels of 10 25 and 40 under the assumption that greater implementation will be difficult at the municipal level here density refers to the percentage of municipal or public land that is covered by a bioretention cell bioretention cell size is set at 0 01 acre for the swmm modeling software input and the number of cells is calculated to reach the total bioretention acreage in each subcatchment that reflects the setting for the density routing levels are 25 40 and 70 as we assume that a greater degree of placement flexibility is available for municipal land there are a total of nine centralized bioretention management scenarios two combined scenarios simulate the implementation of decentralized 0 01 acre bioretention cells at a 25 density level and a 25 routing with a 50 gallon rwhs at a 25 density level and b 200 gallon rwhs at a 25 density level these scenarios represent low levels of decentralized bioretention and test the incremental effect of rwhs two additional combined scenario simulates centralized bioretention deployment at a 25 density level with a 25 routing and decentralized bioretention cell deployment at 25 density level with 25 routing with a cell size of c 0 01 acre and d 0 03 acre these scenarios represent mid range level of centralized bioretention with minimal routing and test low to mid range levels of decentralized bioretention deployment there are four combined management scenarios 4 5 storm events small frequent events are simulated to calibrate the model and assess management scenarios data were collected from the usgs monitoring station 0208735012 at rocky branch below pullen drive in raleigh which is located 2 41 km from the walnut creek wetland center during the period of january 1 2010 to december 31 2015 708 events were recorded and reported the maximum depth event resulted in 10 67 cm of precipitation which is less than the depth of a 5 yr 24 h event 99 of the recorded events are smaller than the 1 yr 24 h design storm 7 29 cm and the median precipitation is 0 38 cm four events are simulated with precipitation depths of 0 28 3 43 3 89 and 7 57 cm for calibration and management scenarios for each of these events there is no precipitation on the preceding day indicating that the watersheds are not saturated and maximum field capacity can be assumed data are available in 5 min intervals simulations are also performed for six type ii 24 h design storms for the area of study noaa 2016 the total depth of each storm is 8 79 cm 2 yr 11 10 cm 5 yr 12 90 cm 10 yr 15 32 cm 25 yr 17 25 cm 50 yr and 19 23 cm 100 yr 5 results 5 1 model calibration continuous streamflow data for the location of interest was unavailable and the swmm model of the wcww was evaluated using rainfall and runoff data for small events measured at the rocky branch below pullen park usgs monitoring station the rocky branch watershed is 3 03 km2 usgs 2017 compared to the area of the wcww which is 2 54 km2 the size percent of impervious surface soil types and slope of the rocky branch watershed are very similar to those of the wcww modeled flows for the wcww and observed flows for the rocky branch watershed are compared for four small frequent events 0 28 3 43 3 89 and 7 57 cm and the differences between peak flow are used for model calibration to adjust imperviousness depression storage roughness coefficients and overland flow path width the average difference between observed and modeled values is 34 for total flow volumes and 36 for peak flows fig 3 a set of eight storm events selected from the same time period that vary in size and duration are employed for model validation for the validation events the average difference in runoff volumes is 38 and 40 for peak flows fig 4 compares the difference in observed and monitored flows diversion from modeled and observed values can be attributed to the physical and structural differences of the catchment of study and the catchment draining to the usgs monitoring station model and observed flow rates follow similar trends though peak flows are underestimated fig 3 model performance was further improved by setting imperviousness levels to values of almost 100 because these values are unrealistic the values that result in the performance shown in figs 3 and 4 are kept for exploring management scenarios in the following sections 5 2 gi management scenarios ten storms including six design storms and four observed storms are simulated for the forty five gi management scenarios resulting in a total of 450 simulations 5 2 1 rwhs scenarios for rwhs scenarios the total volume reduction varies from 0 0 to 4 5 across parameter settings and 10 simulated rain events fig 5 peak flow reduction varies from 0 0 to 4 1 reduction is greater with increasing watershed coverage for smaller storm events while for large events greater watershed coverage does not substantially improve runoff reduction there is a break in the pattern between the events with depth of 7 57 and 8 79 cm design storms are of depths 8 79 cm and greater and the monotonic drop in performance across these storms is due to the regular distribution of these storms over a 24 h period for large rainfall events and some rwhs configurations reduction of runoff is a negative value fig 5 design storms do not show any negative values and this is attributed to the regular distribution of rainfall increasing and decreasing over the duration of the rain event for irregular realistic events results show that rwhs marginally increase runoff this type of result has been shown for other studies that modeled alternative storms and implementation of gi using swmm mccutcheon 2013 the results for rwhs simulation were inconclusive and did not establish that lid would reduce run off volumes or peak flows they observed different behavior depending on catchment and storm size and that trends were more consistent for total run off volumes than for peak flows 5 2 2 decentralized bioretention cell scenarios assessing the effects of routing cell size and household participation for the design storms corresponding to the area of study reduction values range from 1 5 to 31 5 for total run off volumes and from 0 0 to 25 3 for peak flows figs 6 and 7 for the monitored frequent events volume reduction ranges from 1 5 to 35 6 and peak flow reduction from 0 6 to 33 3 figs 6 and 7 watershed coverage and percent routing affect the volume reduction for the three cell sizes for the smallest cell size the effects of the watershed coverage and percent routing change with the size of rain events for small rain events the routing design drives the reduction while for large storms the watershed coverage is the more important design parameter for example as shown in fig 6 a there is little difference in the performance between routing values of 25 and 40 for events with depth greater that 10 cm when the watershed coverage is kept constant for cell sizes of 0 03 and 0 06 acres fig 6 b and c similar patterns occur where the effect of routing decreases with rainfall depth however this effect is less for larger cell sizes and there is some difference in the performance of routing levels of 25 and 40 when watershed coverage is kept constant for a small cell size the volume reduction drops off for larger storms for all routing and watershed coverage settings for the largest cell size on the other hand the effect of the biorention cell remains similar across all rainfall events for routing set to 40 and watershed coverage at 100 peak flow reduction shows some similarities to volume reduction for example for large bioretention cells fig 7 b and c the difference in performance between routing levels of 25 and 40 reduces for large rain events that is for larger storms there is little advantage to route a higher percentage of the landscape to the bioretention cells the reduction in peak flows shows a distinct drop off between the rain events of 3 43 cm and 3 89 cm for all design settings except for the most optimistic scenario using a cell size of 0 06 acres 40 routing and 100 coverage as seen in fig 3 the peak flow increases significantly from 6 m3 s to 18 m3 s for these two events respectively most of the bioretention cell designs modeled here lose performance for the higher peak flow results for peak flow show some inconsistencies for example the peak flow simulated for bioretention cells with size of 0 01 acres routing of 40 and coverage of 100 is higher than the peak flow simulated for bioretention cells with the same settings but routing set at 25 for larger storms small discrepancies with using swmm for peak flow calculations have been reported by other researchers mccutcheon 2013 and in this research general trends are used to evaluate efficiency of gi designs based on peak flow 5 2 3 centralized bioretention cell scenarios in the centralized scenarios watershed coverage is based in the area of available municipally owned vacant land whereas the decentralized scenario is based on the number of private households in the catchment as a result there is less total land allocated for bioretention cells at the maximum density level for the centralized scenarios 27 12 acres or 0 11 km2 compared to the decentralized scenarios 73 32 acres or 0 30 km2 for the centralized scenarios the highest level of routing that is simulated is 70 while the highest level of routing simulated for the decentralized scenario is 40 as a result greater reduction in runoff is achieved with the centralized approach for the design storms reduction values for total volume range from 5 0 to 29 5 and from 0 0 to 17 8 for peak flows for the monitored events reduction values range from 6 82 to 43 8 for total flow reduction and from 3 2 to 48 1 for peak flows as shown the decentralized scenarios volume reduction is most influenced by routing for small storms and for large events volume reduction is driven by coverage fig 8 for example for the largest events the scenarios with 10 coverage result in very similar volume reduction the influence of watershed coverage is minimal for small rain depth and increases with event size as event size beyond the 2 yr storm event this influence does not change substantially the reduction in peak flow for the centralized scenarios is also similar to the performance of the decentralized scenarios in patterns there is a drop off in performance between storms of depth 3 43 cm and 3 89 cm due to the increase in peak flows fig 9 scenarios with 70 routing perform highest for small storms and for increasing depths of rain events the performance of all scenarios to effectively reduce peak flows becomes limited 5 2 4 combined scenarios four combined scenarios are explored the two first scenarios explore the results of implementing decentralized 0 01 acres bioretention cells with a 25 watershed density and 25 routing these scenarios include rwhs implemented at 25 density for a 50 gallons and b 200 gallons scenarios c and d implement centralized bioretention cells at a 25 watershed density level and with 25 routing these scenarios include decentralized cells with 25 coverage and 25 routing with cell sizes of c 0 01 acres and d 0 03 acres the effect of rwhs implementation is limited because of the moderate household density of the watershed and the impact on volumetric reduction on a combined scenario is marginal fig 10 results for scenarios c and d demonstrate the influence of increasing bioretention cells sizes from 0 01 to 0 03 acres impacts for scenarios b and c are not the direct sum of the effects of each management strategy and volumetric reduction of run off in the combined scenarios reduces as storm size increases 6 discussion results vary somewhat across the simulated storms the most effective design for the smaller three historic storms based on reduction in runoff volume is the most aggressive centralized bioretention cell scenario the most effective design for the largest historic storm and the six design storms is the most aggressive decentralized bioretention cell scenario the regularity of the rainfall as simulated by the design storms affects the performance of each management scenario further the model was calibrated for small storms that are not as large as the design storms therefore there may be mechanistic processes that are not represented accurately in the model for large rain events though the model was calibrated using data from a neighboring watershed trends in flow are captured for the calibration and validation rain events cost considerations should be taken into account the cost is approximated here based on the land that is covered by any gi scenario as shown in fig 11 the simulations show a trade off that is expected where an increase in area covered by gi generates a higher reduction in runoff volume for the 3 89 cm event solutions that dominate a large number of other solutions are the centralized bioretention cell scenario with 70 routing and 40 coverage and the centralized bioretention cell scenario with 70 routing and 25 coverage though the decentralized bioretention cell scenarios generate the largest reduction in runoff they come at a high cost in the amount of land covered by gi similar trends in the trade off curve were observed for other storms 7 conclusions this research explores the hydrological impacts of a set of gi based management strategies at the watershed scale the placement of gi technologies was designed to target locations in underprivileged communities with high outreach potential simulation of management scenarios included the implementation of rwhs bioretention cells and combinations of the two gi technologies runoff mitigation was assessed for different storm events including historic and design storms for the walnut creek wetland watershed in central north carolina this research contributes to the array of studies evaluating the impacts of gi deployment at the watershed scale in contrast with previous research this study compares the outcome of centralized management strategies that cover municipally owned land with decentralized strategies placed on privately owned residential properties in addition this research addresses the physical limitations of gi placement at selected sites and explores the effect of different levels of flow routing to the gi this approach facilitates comparison of the influence of flow routing and gi density level when deploying gi structures at the watershed scale results here demonstrate that the implementation of rwhs has a limited effect on runoff volume reduction in areas with moderate population and urbanization density full catchment deployment is necessary for achieving substantial runoff mitigation a rwhs based management strategy targeted at private households would be more effective in high density environments although large storage systems would also be more effective for stormwater management in wet areas financial and structural limitations may hinder widespread adoption the performance of rwhs also depends on the actions of a household rwhs that are not emptied before a storm event will not reduce runoff in addition to stormwater runoff reduction and water conservation rwhs can serve as a familiarization and educational tool to pave the way for the adoption of integrated water resources management approaches the marginal cost of small sized rwhs units and the minimal maintenance these systems require facilitates the viability of adopting rwhs implementation by the general population stormwater management strategies that incorporate bioretention cells can be greatly effective in runoff mitigation and can achieve considerable reduction even in extreme events for small storm events the percent of impervious surface draining to the bioretention cells routing level has an overall greater influence than cell size and watershed coverage as storm size increases watershed coverage and cell size have a greater impact on volume and peak flow reduction watershed coverage and cell size are inextricably related and have a similar impact on runoff mitigation in order to effectively achieve run off mitigation both routing and coverage should be carefully considered the decentralized and centralized scenarios result in different watershed coverage levels with more area covered in the decentralized scenario for the case study presented here in contrast the centralized scenario simulates greater routing of pervious flows both scenarios can achieve significant reduction of runoff volumes and peak flows even for extreme precipitation events the greatest reduction is realized by the decentralized scenario which is achieved when the bioretention cell size is largest this may be challenging to implement as individual owners may not be willing to allocate significant portions of their yards for storm water management in addition a decentralized scenario relies on consistent maintenance practices by homeowners or tenants lack of maintenance can reduce performance of decentralized management scenarios strong community involvement and commitment would be necessary to ensure the success and efficiency of a decentralized scenario appropriate location placement of bioretention cell is also an important factor for cell efficiency maximum routing of the runoff is desired though private household owners may be limited in routing to bioretention cells for centralized strategies municipalities may have a wider set of options in terms of site selection in addition retrofits may be possible to increase the routing of runoff from impervious surfaces to the cell a combined centralized decentralized scenario offers an alternative management approach that may relieve municipalities of the associated costs of implementation and maintenance while engaging members of the community in storm water management and sustainability the placement of gi in areas with high outreach potential can contribute to efforts to educate and familiarize the public with urban sustainability and water resources management issues which facilitates the adoption of additional practices and conservation measures underprivileged communities can greatly benefit from the implementation of these practices gi based management strategies can offer opportunities for environmental education and awareness among communities that have been traditionally disconnected from these issues water conservation and diminishing flooding can provide economic relief in these neighborhoods the research presented here does not evaluate through tangible metrics the potential social benefits of watershed scale implementation of gi in underprivileged communities experimental research following the site selection approach of this study could be applied to evaluate resulting social benefits in addition the tradeoffs among the cost of gi designs environmental improvements and social benefits should be explored while the results of this research are specific to the case study they can provide insight about selecting gi strategies for stormwater management decision making in urban areas 
7410,increasing urbanization augments impervious surface area which results in increased run off volumes and peak flows green infrastructure gi approaches are a decentralized alternative for sustainable urban stormwater and provide an array of ecosystem services and foster community building by enhancing neighborhood aesthetics increasing property value and providing shared green spaces while projects involving sustainability concepts and environmental design are favored in privileged communities marginalized communities have historically been located in areas that suffer from environmental degradation underprivileged communities typically do not receive as many social and environmental services as advantaged communities this research explores gi based management strategies that are evaluated at the watershed scale to improve hydrological performance by mitigating storm water run off volumes and peak flows gi deployment strategies are developed to address environmental justice issues by prioritizing placement in communities that are underprivileged and locations with high outreach potential a hydrologic hydraulic stormwater model is developed using the storm water management model swmm 5 1 to simulate the impacts of alternative management strategies management scenarios include the implementation of rain water harvesting in private households the decentralized implementation of bioretention cells in private households the centralized implementation of bioretention cells in municipally owned vacant land and combinations of those strategies realities of implementing gi on private and public lands are taken into account to simulate various levels of coverage and routing for bioretention cell scenarios the effects of these strategies are measured by the volumetric reduction of run off and reduction in peak flow social benefits are not evaluated this approach is applied in an underprivileged community within the walnut creek watershed in raleigh

demonstrates that widespread gi implementation across a watershed can significantly improve flashy hydrology by reducing peak flows the frequency of runoff events and variability in runoff compared to grey infrastructure pennino et al 2016 li et al 2017 in addition gi improves air and water quality urban heat island effects property values and public health wang et al 2013 and is typically more cost effective than equivalent grey infrastructure usepa 2014 while gi has been successfully deployed through a range of programs from small scale demonstrations to notable efforts like the green alley program in chicago chicago department of transportation 2007 and the green city clean waters program in philadelphia philadelphia water department 2011 the wide adoption of these approaches on a large scale has been neglected for a number of reasons stakeholders and municipalities remain uncertain about the efficiency of gi to mitigate stormwater while some research has explored the effectiveness of gi to reduce stormwater in small catchments shuster and rhea 2013 jarden et al 2016 walsh et al 2014 york et al 2015 petrucci et al 2012 vargas 2009 jones and hunt 2010 jensen et al 2010 catchment level studies that evaluated rainwater harvesting systems rwhs and bioretention cells found a wide array of possible outcomes walsh et al 2014 petrucci et al 2012 york et al 2015 barich 2014 masi 2011 only a limited set of studies have explored their efficacy at a watershed scale hood et al 2007 damodaram et al 2010 line et al 2012 ahiablame et al 2013 bedan and clausen 2009 gi technologies are decentralized solutions and wide scale gi implementation across a watershed and community is needed to attain flood abatement eckart et al 2017 small scale projects that are not duplicated throughout a watershed will have limited effects on runoff reduction a substantial amount of impervious area is located on private residences where access is limited for implementing infrastructure and gi programs must engage communities to extend the benefits of gi equitably among diverse groups across watersheds doberstein et al 2010 roy et al 2008 members of marginalized and mixed income neighborhoods have been historically overlooked by policymakers and frequently excluded from environmental decision making processes they may not engage in gi initiatives due to perceptions about the distribution of costs and benefits distrust of local government prioritization of other household needs and transience of residence in the affected neighborhood baptiste et al 2015 barnhill and smardon 2012 perceptions and uncertainty among constituents cannot be easily allayed because the costs of ecosystem service degradation have been disproportionately felt by poor and non white communities in the past sanchez et al 2014 2015 norman et al 2012 while watershed restoration projects have been implemented more often in affluent neighborhoods dernoga et al 2015 perreault et al 2012 the objective of this research is to develop an integrated approach to prioritize placement of gi strategies within marginalized communities and evaluate watershed wide effectiveness of gi we apply the approach to explore the effect of bioretention cells and rwhs on runoff mitigation by conducting a set of simulation experiments for a watershed first a geospatial approach is developed to prioritize locations for placing gi that will benefit underprivileged communities and provide outreach opportunities the adoption of innovative gi practices is often hindered by uncertainty risk perceptions and limited or inaccurate knowledge olorunkiya et al 2012 beecher et al 2005 and familiarity can reduce perceptions of risk bowman and thompson 2009 and positively influence adoption rates and willingness to adopt gi practices stacy 2015 placing gi at locations with elevated foot traffic provides opportunities for sustained outreach the method presented here conducts spatial analysis of socioeconomic parameters to identify underprivileged communities and proximity to areas of high foot traffic to identify target locations for placing gi second gi strategies are developed to test a range of modeled settings that effect performance scenarios are constructed using various configurations of rwhs and bioretention cells with different levels of density levels and infrastructure characteristics to represent realistic limitations in adoption of gi and constraints on treating impervious surfaces a hydrologic and hydraulic model of the watershed is constructed to evaluate the effect of a range of gi strategies on runoff reduction impacts of bioretention cell deployment are assessed for both centralized municipally owned vacant land and decentralized e g private households scenarios results demonstrate the range of performance of gi approaches contextualized within a watershed for a range of realistic modeled settings this integrated approach to stormwater management is applied for the walnut creek watershed located in south raleigh in wake county north carolina 2 background on gi simulation this research focuses on simulating the effectiveness of bioretention cells and rwhs for improving stormwater management rwhs intercepts rooftop run off and can serve as a tool for decentralized water supply and management of storm water fletcher et al 2007 steffen et al 2013 while rwhs can have significant effects on reducing potable water demand jensen 2008 effects on runoff mitigation are typically marginal and large storage sizes are needed for effective stormwater control jones and hunt 2010 studies on the effects of rwhs on watershed hydrology show a wide arrange of possible outcomes walsh et al 2014 found that for a high density urban watershed a rwhs based management strategy has the potential to reduce the volume of stormwater run off by 10 4 using 50 gallon rain tanks and by 12 4 for 200 gallon rain tanks at full implementation capacity 100 watershed coverage in contrast petrucci et al 2012 found that with 33 3 watershed coverage and rain tank sizes of 0 6 m3 158 5 gallon and 0 8 m3 211 gallon hydrological impacts were negligible research indicates that systems with large storage capacity 200 1 000 gallon are most effective for stormwater management york et al 2015 though they may not be practical bioretention systems or rain gardens are commonly used in stormwater management of urbanizing watersheds liu et al 2014 davis et al 2010 the impacts of bioretention cell implementation at the watershed scale have not been explored extensively york et al 2015 and a limited number of studies have explored bioretention cells with varying results barich 2014 found run off volume reductions of 20 30 a study in the north creek watershed in illinois tetra tech 2012 found volume reductions after cell implementation of 50 and york et al 2015 observed minimal 1 reduction for an average year after moderate implementation of cells in the watershed these studies vary in watershed size percentage of impervious surface and level of implementation and as a result generalization of results is not possible studies that simulate bioretention cells have routed all impervious flows towards the cell masi 2011 barich 2014 this assumption is likely unrealistic particularly in watershed scale models where site selection is limited and cannot be analyzed on a case by case basis studies assessing the watershed scale impacts of bioretention cell implementation explore the implementation in municipally owned land york et al 2015 masi 2011 or consider the conversion of a percent of impervious surface in the watershed to gi without considering the ownership of the locations that are retrofitted barich 2014 this research compares the impacts of centralized municipally owned land and decentralized privately owned land management strategies none of the studies cited above address environmental justice by focusing on the selection of underprivileged areas for implementing these technologies 3 methods 3 1 selecting locations for gi placement analysis using a geographic information system gis is employed to identify preferred locations for the placement of gi infrastructure within a watershed these potentially ideal locations for the placement of gi infrastructure are selected using two criteria socioeconomic status and outreach potential target locations for gi implementation are socioeconomically underprivileged or marginalized communities socioeconomically underprivileged distressed or disadvantaged areas are identified by joining areas with the following attributes high and owen 2014 average unemployment rate is 50 greater than the state average unemployment rate annual per capita income is one third lower than the state average annual per capita income and average poverty rate is 50 greater than the state average poverty rate tabular data is joined to relate it to the spatial census block group data and new shapefiles of unemployment per capita income and poverty rate categories are created census blocks meeting the three criteria that define underprivileged communities are selected from the resulting shapefiles the second selection criterion outreach potential offers the opportunity to expose and familiarize the public with gi infrastructure high impact areas are identified as areas in which elevated foot traffic facilitates exposure to gi infrastructure so that the public becomes more familiar with these practices places of interest such as schools churches libraries supermarkets and post offices are identified and the surrounding 152 4 m 500 ft radius area is defined as a high impact area high impact areas that are in underprivileged areas are classified as preferred gi locations bioretention cells can be placed in public private and vacant land rwhs can be placed in private residential property commercial businesses and institutional facilities 3 2 hydrologic modeling the environmental protection agency storm water management model swmm 5 1 usepa 2015 is used in this research to model the hydrological and hydraulic behavior of the catchment swmm is a dynamic rainfall runoff model that estimates combined sewer overflows runoff volumes and velocity generated by rainfall events swmm is open ware non proprietary and designed primarily to model urban areas swmm 5 1 allows explicit simulation of gi infrastructure gi can be placed in an existing subcatchment or be demarcated as a new subcatchment covered by gi infrastructure when gi structures are modeled as individual subcatchments the subcatchment s properties such as area slope curve number or imperviousness are encoded as those of the gi usepa 2015 gi implementation reduces the percentage of impervious surface and a fraction of the run off can be rerouted to pervious areas further reducing the runoff volume received by the gi 4 case study walnut creek wetland watershed the selected area of study lies within the walnut creek watershed which is part of the neuse river basin in central north carolina located in wake county the walnut creek watershed extends from the town of cary in the west throughout the south of the city of raleigh until it reaches the neuse river on its east end fig 1 the walnut creek watershed hydrologic unit code 030202011101 has a total surface area of almost 121 km2 and over 467 km of stream the watershed has the highest percentage of land covered by urban land uses in the neuse river basin and with a projected population increase of 40 in wake county for the year 2035 rapid urbanization and increase of impervious surface is expected north carolina office of state budget and management 2015 a total of 66 8 of the watershed is currently developed the average annual precipitation in the walnut creek watershed is 40 5 in precipitation is fairly evenly distributed through the year and the average difference in rainfall between the driest month january and wettest month september is 5 62 in the main branch of the walnut creek watershed the walnut creek is a lazy or slow running urban creek when heavy rain occurs there is flooding along the banks development along the creek has accentuated flooding problems and threatens the water quality of the creek and the receiving body which is the neuse river ncsu 2000 areas of the walnut creek watershed are located in underprivileged communities with a predominantly african american racial makeup and have been significantly affected by repeated flooding rochester heights neighborhood is the first african american housing development in raleigh and is built partly within the walnut creek floodplain rochester heights has been historically neglected and environmentally impaired raw sewage was discharged into walnut creek next to the subdivision up until the 1960s and until recently the community and the wetland area was commonly used as a dumping facility the natural learning initiative 2002 due to frequent flooding events residents were charged by the city of raleigh for stormwater management services despite the faulty conditions of the drainage system in contrast residents of more privileged areas suffering the same flooding events were not charged for the same services ncsu 2000 in the mid 1990s a grassroots group of stakeholders community leaders and advocates formed the partners for environmental justice pej whose goal was to promote the growth and quality of life of southeast raleigh this group focused on the conservation and restoration of 0 198 km2 of wetlands in southeast raleigh and created the walnut creek urban wetlands educational park which resolved some flooding issues in the area and improved the environmental health of the wetland area in addition the park provided a healthy wildlife habitat beautified a neglected area of the city of raleigh and created a recreational resource for the residents of the surrounding areas while serving as an environmental outreach and educational opportunity the natural learning initiative 2002 flooding issues and environmental disparity persist in this area however and the health of walnut creek may improve from the multiple benefits that gi approaches bring to urban communities in the face of climate change population increase and rapid urbanization gi approaches may be a critical component of revitalization projects detwiler 2012 4 1 selection of preferred locations for gi placement analysis using gis is employed to identify preferred locations for the placement of gi preferred locations are those that are located in socioeconomically underprivileged communities within the watershed and intersect with high impact locations census data was obtained at the block group level from the national historical geographic information system minnesota population center 2011 for 2010 2014 according to the united states census bureau and the 2010 2014 american community survey 5 year estimates the state unemployment rate is 6 6 the state per capita income is 25 608 and the state poverty rate is 17 6 united states census bureau 2015 communities that are underprivileged are characterized by an unemployment rate of 9 9 or greater a per capita income lower than 17 072 and a poverty rate of at least 26 4 these areas are shown in fig 2 high impact areas are defined here as areas in which elevated foot traffic facilitates exposure to gi so that the public becomes more familiar with these practices places of interest such as schools churches libraries supermarkets and post offices are identified and the surrounding 152 4 m radius is used to define high impact areas fig 1 data were collected from the wake county gis service wake county gis service 2016 preferred locations fig 1 are the areas where high impact areas overlap with underprivileged areas fig 1 analysis shows that a large percentage of the potential sites for gi implementation are located in southeast raleigh in the vicinity of rochester heights neighborhood 4 2 catchment selection the area selected for hydrologic modeling and simulation is the area draining to the inlet of the walnut creek wetlands or the walnut creek wetland watershed wcww shown as a blue line in figs 1 and 2 although historic flow data is not available for this catchment and there is no monitored flow at the outlet the catchment is selected based on the methodology described above for prioritizing high density of preferred gi locations additionally there is considerable community level interest in this area as demonstrated through development of the pej and new data about watershed modeling and gi performance can be shared with engaged stakeholders through the walnut creek wetland community project water resources research institute of the unc system 2017 catchment delineation is performed using archydro maidment 2002 for a raw digital elevation model obtained from the north carolina floodplain mapping program ncfmp 2017 the wcww covers 2 54 km2 and has a percentage of imperviousness of 36 5 which was calculated using the land use map of imperviousness from the national land cover database xian et al 2011 suitable locations for the implementation of bioretention cells and rwhs are selected from preferred gi locations fig 2 according to the specific requirements of these different practices bioretention cells can be placed in either public or private open space or vacant land rwhs can be placed in private residential property and commercial and institutional facilities there are 0 27 km2 of vacant land available for placement of bioretention cells and 1 222 households with potential for rwhs or small size bioretention cells 4 3 swmm model 4 3 1 subcatchments the catchment of study is discretized into 28 smaller subcatchments according to land use overland flow path and draining direction subcatchments are defined in terms of area imperviousness flow path length width and slope shapefiles from the national land cover database homer et al 2015 are used to estimate the total watershed imperviousness at 36 53 this approach typically underestimates imperviousness and based on visual analysis of orthophotos total imperviousness in the watershed is estimated as 64 9 with values for individual subcatchments ranging from 22 4 to 100 directly connected impervious area dcia is considered the primary contributor of stormwater runoff during small rain events 2 54 cm or 1 in walsh 2000 walsh 2004 flint and davis 2007 and is used for imperviousness in swmm using the wenger method wenger et al 2008 3 dcia 1 046 tia 6 23 archydro and digital elevation models are used to find flow direction and width of subcatchments width is calculated as the subcatchment area divided by the flow path length which is calculated as the area weighted average of longest overland flows in natural and urban areas flow path length is estimated as 152 4 m for undeveloped areas and as the distance from the back of a representative lot to the middle of the street for residential lots slope was assumed as 2 in impervious land and for pervious areas overland slope was calculated from topographical elevation data and overland flow length the subcatchment slope was subsequently calculated again as an area weighted average subcatchment slope values range from 0 03 to 6 9 infiltration was calculated using the green ampt method with parameters for sandy loam which is the soil type throughout the wcww other parameters were used based on recommendations from the swmm user s manual usepa 2015 table 1 4 3 2 drainage network the storm water drainage network for each subcatchment is modeled in swmm data was obtained in the form of gis shapefiles provided from the city of raleigh stormwater management division b hinkle personal communication august 2015 with characterization for geometries and lengths of pipes junctions bridges swales and open channels the network is represented by 73 drainage elements which make up the main stems of the piping system and open or natural channels invert elevations were estimated from topographical information and a cover depth of 0 92 m 3 ft was added to the invert elevation for each closed conduit conduit roughness manning s roughness coefficient was set as 0 013 for circular concrete pipes as 0 02 for trapezoidal concrete lined channels asce 1992 and as 0 05 for natural channels usepa 2015 based on visual inspection of open channels they were characterized as trapezoidal with a maximum depth of 0 92 m 3 ft and a bottom width of 3 66 m 12 ft 4 3 3 rainwater harvesting systems rwhs units were modeled using the swmm lid editor which reduces error in predicted runoff volumes compared to the cumulative storage depression storage method walsh et al 2014 in this study two rwhs capacities are assessed 50 gallon 189 3 l and 200 gallon 757 1 l corresponding footprint areas are 0 27 m2 2 89 ft2 and 0 66 m2 7 07 ft2 respectively the smaller design ensures viability in every residence despite lot size restrictions and prevents vector and water quality issues that emerge with longer drain times associated with larger cisterns walsh et al 2014 to account for the routing of precipitation from impervious surfaces e g rooftops to pervious surfaces e g lawns downpour disconnection is assumed and all outflow from rwhs is discharged to pervious areas drain delay is the number of dry hours that it takes for the rain barrel to be emptied through its drain and is set at 24 h rwhs units are simulated as empty at initialization for typical rwhs units only one side of the rooftop drains to the rwhs to represent this the percentage of impervious surface treated is simulated as 50 of the building footprint area the median building footprint in wcww is 131 m2 1 409 ft2 and the impervious surface area treated by each rwhs is as 704 ft2 specifications for each tank type are based on standard rain barrel designs in common retailers and include 58 4 cm 23 in diameter and 86 4 cm 34 in height for the 50 gallon tank and 91 4 cm 36 in diameter and 142 2 cm 56 in height for the 200 gallon tank acquabarrel 2016 overflow is 7 6 cm 3 in diameter and outlet height from the bottom is 1 9 cm 0 75 in for both designs flow rate per unit area of gi q is expressed in eq

an orifice the drain coefficient c or flow coefficient in swmm s lid editor is a function of the drain time t hr of a depth of stored water d in 2 c 2 d 1 2 t drain time is assumed as 24 h for a 50 gallon tank and 48 h for a 200 gallon tank resulting in values of 1 24 cm hr 0 49 in hr and 1 98 cm hr 0 78 in hr for c respectively 4 3 4 bioretention cells bioretention cells are simulated based on a number of inputs including soil characteristics saturated hydraulic conductivity average capillary suction and soil moisture deficit which are estimated based on the swmm user manual version 5 0 rossman 2010 media depth was set at 0 92 m 3 ft based on recommendations for 0 7 1 0 m 2 3 3 3 ft liu et al 2014 the percentage of impervious area treated or percentage of flows routed from impervious surfaces into the bioretention cell is calculated using eq 3 3 a imp treated a t a p a gi r where aimp treated is the area of the catchment that is treated through the use of the gi at is the total area of the catchment ap is the pervious area of the catchment and agi is the area covered by the bioretention cell r is the percentage of the impervious area that is routed to the gi for treatment variation in routing level is achieved through gi site placement which affects the percentage of the flow that is directed towards and captured by the bioretention cell the size of the bioretention cell must be specified by the modeler 4 4 gi simulation and management scenarios gi based managements scenarios are simulated in swmm 5 1 to evaluate the reduction of stormwater volumes and peak flows under different strategies summarized in table 2 deployment of rwhs is simulated at various density levels which refers to the percentage of households that implement rwhs at 10 25 40 and 100 density there are eight rwhs simulation scenarios deployment of bioretention cells is varied based on the size of the cell the average residential property size is 655 6 m2 and the mean yard area is 524 8 m2 bioretention cells that occupy 25 of the total yard size are estimated at 121 4 m2 0 03 acres additional scenarios evaluate bioretention cells of 242 8 m2 0 06 acres and 40 5 m2 0 01 acres decentralized or household level implementation of bioretention cells is simulated at watershed density levels of 10 25 40 and 100 which refers to the percentage of households that implement bioretention cells the three different bioretention cell sizes 0 01 0 03 and 0 06 acres are simulated at each density level previously conducted studies on the effect of bioretention cells assume total capture of runoff volumes from impervious surfaces by the bioretention cells masi 2011 barich 2014 in reality multiple limitations to this assumption may exist due to the layout of both private property and municipal impervious surfaces we assume that such limitations are persistent and that only a fraction of runoff volume can be captured by bioretention cells two routing levels of 25 and 40 are simulated for each density and sizing scenarios in total there are 24 decentralized bioretention management scenarios centralized bioretention cell scenarios are simulated at deployment density levels of 10 25 and 40 under the assumption that greater implementation will be difficult at the municipal level here density refers to the percentage of municipal or public land that is covered by a bioretention cell bioretention cell size is set at 0 01 acre for the swmm modeling software input and the number of cells is calculated to reach the total bioretention acreage in each subcatchment that reflects the setting for the density routing levels are 25 40 and 70 as we assume that a greater degree of placement flexibility is available for municipal land there are a total of nine centralized bioretention management scenarios two combined scenarios simulate the implementation of decentralized 0 01 acre bioretention cells at a 25 density level and a 25 routing with a 50 gallon rwhs at a 25 density level and b 200 gallon rwhs at a 25 density level these scenarios represent low levels of decentralized bioretention and test the incremental effect of rwhs two additional combined scenario simulates centralized bioretention deployment at a 25 density level with a 25 routing and decentralized bioretention cell deployment at 25 density level with 25 routing with a cell size of c 0 01 acre and d 0 03 acre these scenarios represent mid range level of centralized bioretention with minimal routing and test low to mid range levels of decentralized bioretention deployment there are four combined management scenarios 4 5 storm events small frequent events are simulated to calibrate the model and assess management scenarios data were collected from the usgs monitoring station 0208735012 at rocky branch below pullen drive in raleigh which is located 2 41 km from the walnut creek wetland center during the period of january 1 2010 to december 31 2015 708 events were recorded and reported the maximum depth event resulted in 10 67 cm of precipitation which is less than the depth of a 5 yr 24 h event 99 of the recorded events are smaller than the 1 yr 24 h design storm 7 29 cm and the median precipitation is 0 38 cm four events are simulated with precipitation depths of 0 28 3 43 3 89 and 7 57 cm for calibration and management scenarios for each of these events there is no precipitation on the preceding day indicating that the watersheds are not saturated and maximum field capacity can be assumed data are available in 5 min intervals simulations are also performed for six type ii 24 h design storms for the area of study noaa 2016 the total depth of each storm is 8 79 cm 2 yr 11 10 cm 5 yr 12 90 cm 10 yr 15 32 cm 25 yr 17 25 cm 50 yr and 19 23 cm 100 yr 5 results 5 1 model calibration continuous streamflow data for the location of interest was unavailable and the swmm model of the wcww was evaluated using rainfall and runoff data for small events measured at the rocky branch below pullen park usgs monitoring station the rocky branch watershed is 3 03 km2 usgs 2017 compared to the area of the wcww which is 2 54 km2 the size percent of impervious surface soil types and slope of the rocky branch watershed are very similar to those of the wcww modeled flows for the wcww and observed flows for the rocky branch watershed are compared for four small frequent events 0 28 3 43 3 89 and 7 57 cm and the differences between peak flow are used for model calibration to adjust imperviousness depression storage roughness coefficients and overland flow path width the average difference between observed and modeled values is 34 for total flow volumes and 36 for peak flows fig 3 a set of eight storm events selected from the same time period that vary in size and duration are employed for model validation for the validation events the average difference in runoff volumes is 38 and 40 for peak flows fig 4 compares the difference in observed and monitored flows diversion from modeled and observed values can be attributed to the physical and structural differences of the catchment of study and the catchment draining to the usgs monitoring station model and observed flow rates follow similar trends though peak flows are underestimated fig 3 model performance was further improved by setting imperviousness levels to values of almost 100 because these values are unrealistic the values that result in the performance shown in figs 3 and 4 are kept for exploring management scenarios in the following sections 5 2 gi management scenarios ten storms including six design storms and four observed storms are simulated for the forty five gi management scenarios resulting in a total of 450 simulations 5 2 1 rwhs scenarios for rwhs scenarios the total volume reduction varies from 0 0 to 4 5 across parameter settings and 10 simulated rain events fig 5 peak flow reduction varies from 0 0 to 4 1 reduction is greater with increasing watershed coverage for smaller storm events while for large events greater watershed coverage does not substantially improve runoff reduction there is a break in the pattern between the events with depth of 7 57 and 8 79 cm design storms are of depths 8 79 cm and greater and the monotonic drop in performance across these storms is due to the regular distribution of these storms over a 24 h period for large rainfall events and some rwhs configurations reduction of runoff is a negative value fig 5 design storms do not show any negative values and this is attributed to the regular distribution of rainfall increasing and decreasing over the duration of the rain event for irregular realistic events results show that rwhs marginally increase runoff this type of result has been shown for other studies that modeled alternative storms and implementation of gi using swmm mccutcheon 2013 the results for rwhs simulation were inconclusive and did not establish that lid would reduce run off volumes or peak flows they observed different behavior depending on catchment and storm size and that trends were more consistent for total run off volumes than for peak flows 5 2 2 decentralized bioretention cell scenarios assessing the effects of routing cell size and household participation for the design storms corresponding to the area of study reduction values range from 1 5 to 31 5 for total run off volumes and from 0 0 to 25 3 for peak flows figs 6 and 7 for the monitored frequent events volume reduction ranges from 1 5 to 35 6 and peak flow reduction from 0 6 to 33 3 figs 6 and 7 watershed coverage and percent routing affect the volume reduction for the three cell sizes for the smallest cell size the effects of the watershed coverage and percent routing change with the size of rain events for small rain events the routing design drives the reduction while for large storms the watershed coverage is the more important design parameter for example as shown in fig 6 a there is little difference in the performance between routing values of 25 and 40 for events with depth greater that 10 cm when the watershed coverage is kept constant for cell sizes of 0 03 and 0 06 acres fig 6 b and c similar patterns occur where the effect of routing decreases with rainfall depth however this effect is less for larger cell sizes and there is some difference in the performance of routing levels of 25 and 40 when watershed coverage is kept constant for a small cell size the volume reduction drops off for larger storms for all routing and watershed coverage settings for the largest cell size on the other hand the effect of the biorention cell remains similar across all rainfall events for routing set to 40 and watershed coverage at 100 peak flow reduction shows some similarities to volume reduction for example for large bioretention cells fig 7 b and c the difference in performance between routing levels of 25 and 40 reduces for large rain events that is for larger storms there is little advantage to route a higher percentage of the landscape to the bioretention cells the reduction in peak flows shows a distinct drop off between the rain events of 3 43 cm and 3 89 cm for all design settings except for the most optimistic scenario using a cell size of 0 06 acres 40 routing and 100 coverage as seen in fig 3 the peak flow increases significantly from 6 m3 s to 18 m3 s for these two events respectively most of the bioretention cell designs modeled here lose performance for the higher peak flow results for peak flow show some inconsistencies for example the peak flow simulated for bioretention cells with size of 0 01 acres routing of 40 and coverage of 100 is higher than the peak flow simulated for bioretention cells with the same settings but routing set at 25 for larger storms small discrepancies with using swmm for peak flow calculations have been reported by other researchers mccutcheon 2013 and in this research general trends are used to evaluate efficiency of gi designs based on peak flow 5 2 3 centralized bioretention cell scenarios in the centralized scenarios watershed coverage is based in the area of available municipally owned vacant land whereas the decentralized scenario is based on the number of private households in the catchment as a result there is less total land allocated for bioretention cells at the maximum density level for the centralized scenarios 27 12 acres or 0 11 km2 compared to the decentralized scenarios 73 32 acres or 0 30 km2 for the centralized scenarios the highest level of routing that is simulated is 70 while the highest level of routing simulated for the decentralized scenario is 40 as a result greater reduction in runoff is achieved with the centralized approach for the design storms reduction values for total volume range from 5 0 to 29 5 and from 0 0 to 17 8 for peak flows for the monitored events reduction values range from 6 82 to 43 8 for total flow reduction and from 3 2 to 48 1 for peak flows as shown the decentralized scenarios volume reduction is most influenced by routing for small storms and for large events volume reduction is driven by coverage fig 8 for example for the largest events the scenarios with 10 coverage result in very similar volume reduction the influence of watershed coverage is minimal for small rain depth and increases with event size as event size beyond the 2 yr storm event this influence does not change substantially the reduction in peak flow for the centralized scenarios is also similar to the performance of the decentralized scenarios in patterns there is a drop off in performance between storms of depth 3 43 cm and 3 89 cm due to the increase in peak flows fig 9 scenarios with 70 routing perform highest for small storms and for increasing depths of rain events the performance of all scenarios to effectively reduce peak flows becomes limited 5 2 4 combined scenarios four combined scenarios are explored the two first scenarios explore the results of implementing decentralized 0 01 acres bioretention cells with a 25 watershed density and 25 routing these scenarios include rwhs implemented at 25 density for a 50 gallons and b 200 gallons scenarios c and d implement centralized bioretention cells at a 25 watershed density level and with 25 routing these scenarios include decentralized cells with 25 coverage and 25 routing with cell sizes of c 0 01 acres and d 0 03 acres the effect of rwhs implementation is limited because of the moderate household density of the watershed and the impact on volumetric reduction on a combined scenario is marginal fig 10 results for scenarios c and d demonstrate the influence of increasing bioretention cells sizes from 0 01 to 0 03 acres impacts for scenarios b and c are not the direct sum of the effects of each management strategy and volumetric reduction of run off in the combined scenarios reduces as storm size increases 6 discussion results vary somewhat across the simulated storms the most effective design for the smaller three historic storms based on reduction in runoff volume is the most aggressive centralized bioretention cell scenario the most effective design for the largest historic storm and the six design storms is the most aggressive decentralized bioretention cell scenario the regularity of the rainfall as simulated by the design storms affects the performance of each management scenario further the model was calibrated for small storms that are not as large as the design storms therefore there may be mechanistic processes that are not represented accurately in the model for large rain events though the model was calibrated using data from a neighboring watershed trends in flow are captured for the calibration and validation rain events cost considerations should be taken into account the cost is approximated here based on the land that is covered by any gi scenario as shown in fig 11 the simulations show a trade off that is expected where an increase in area covered by gi generates a higher reduction in runoff volume for the 3 89 cm event solutions that dominate a large number of other solutions are the centralized bioretention cell scenario with 70 routing and 40 coverage and the centralized bioretention cell scenario with 70 routing and 25 coverage though the decentralized bioretention cell scenarios generate the largest reduction in runoff they come at a high cost in the amount of land covered by gi similar trends in the trade off curve were observed for other storms 7 conclusions this research explores the hydrological impacts of a set of gi based management strategies at the watershed scale the placement of gi technologies was designed to target locations in underprivileged communities with high outreach potential simulation of management scenarios included the implementation of rwhs bioretention cells and combinations of the two gi technologies runoff mitigation was assessed for different storm events including historic and design storms for the walnut creek wetland watershed in central north carolina this research contributes to the array of studies evaluating the impacts of gi deployment at the watershed scale in contrast with previous research this study compares the outcome of centralized management strategies that cover municipally owned land with decentralized strategies placed on privately owned residential properties in addition this research addresses the physical limitations of gi placement at selected sites and explores the effect of different levels of flow routing to the gi this approach facilitates comparison of the influence of flow routing and gi density level when deploying gi structures at the watershed scale results here demonstrate that the implementation of rwhs has a limited effect on runoff volume reduction in areas with moderate population and urbanization density full catchment deployment is necessary for achieving substantial runoff mitigation a rwhs based management strategy targeted at private households would be more effective in high density environments although large storage systems would also be more effective for stormwater management in wet areas financial and structural limitations may hinder widespread adoption the performance of rwhs also depends on the actions of a household rwhs that are not emptied before a storm event will not reduce runoff in addition to stormwater runoff reduction and water conservation rwhs can serve as a familiarization and educational tool to pave the way for the adoption of integrated water resources management approaches the marginal cost of small sized rwhs units and the minimal maintenance these systems require facilitates the viability of adopting rwhs implementation by the general population stormwater management strategies that incorporate bioretention cells can be greatly effective in runoff mitigation and can achieve considerable reduction even in extreme events for small storm events the percent of impervious surface draining to the bioretention cells routing level has an overall greater influence than cell size and watershed coverage as storm size increases watershed coverage and cell size have a greater impact on volume and peak flow reduction watershed coverage and cell size are inextricably related and have a similar impact on runoff mitigation in order to effectively achieve run off mitigation both routing and coverage should be carefully considered the decentralized and centralized scenarios result in different watershed coverage levels with more area covered in the decentralized scenario for the case study presented here in contrast the centralized scenario simulates greater routing of pervious flows both scenarios can achieve significant reduction of runoff volumes and peak flows even for extreme precipitation events the greatest reduction is realized by the decentralized scenario which is achieved when the bioretention cell size is largest this may be challenging to implement as individual owners may not be willing to allocate significant portions of their yards for storm water management in addition a decentralized scenario relies on consistent maintenance practices by homeowners or tenants lack of maintenance can reduce performance of decentralized management scenarios strong community involvement and commitment would be necessary to ensure the success and efficiency of a decentralized scenario appropriate location placement of bioretention cell is also an important factor for cell efficiency maximum routing of the runoff is desired though private household owners may be limited in routing to bioretention cells for centralized strategies municipalities may have a wider set of options in terms of site selection in addition retrofits may be possible to increase the routing of runoff from impervious surfaces to the cell a combined centralized decentralized scenario offers an alternative management approach that may relieve municipalities of the associated costs of implementation and maintenance while engaging members of the community in storm water management and sustainability the placement of gi in areas with high outreach potential can contribute to efforts to educate and familiarize the public with urban sustainability and water resources management issues which facilitates the adoption of additional practices and conservation measures underprivileged communities can greatly benefit from the implementation of these practices gi based management strategies can offer opportunities for environmental education and awareness among communities that have been traditionally disconnected from these issues water conservation and diminishing flooding can provide economic relief in these neighborhoods the research presented here does not evaluate through tangible metrics the potential social benefits of watershed scale implementation of gi in underprivileged communities experimental research following the site selection approach of this study could be applied to evaluate resulting social benefits in addition the tradeoffs among the cost of gi designs environmental improvements and social benefits should be explored while the results of this research are specific to the case study they can provide insight about selecting gi strategies for stormwater management decision making in urban areas 
7411,identifying nonpoint sources of nitrate has been a long term challenge in mixed land use watershed in the present study we combine dual nitrate isotope runoff and stream water monitoring to elucidate the nonpoint nitrate sources across land use and determine the relative importance of biogeochemical processes for nitrate export in a small suburban watershed longhongjian watershed china our study suggested that nh4 fertilizer soil nh4 litter fall and groundwater were the main nitrate sources in longhongjian stream there were large changes in nitrate sources in response to season and land use runoff analysis illustrated that the tea plantation and forest areas contributed to a dominated proportion of the tn export spatial analysis illustrated that no3 concentration was high in the tea plantation and forest areas and δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 were enriched in the step ponds temporal analysis showed high no3 level in spring and nitrate isotopes were enriched in summer study as well showed that the step ponds played an important role in mitigating nitrate pollution nitrification and plant uptake were the significant biogeochemical processes contributing to the nitrogen transformation and denitrification hardly occurred in the stream keywords nitrate isotopes biogeochemical processes runoff source identification land use 1 introduction identifying nonpoint sources of nitrate in mixed land use watershed has been a long term challenge since the sources of nitrate in watersheds are complex due to mixing of different nitrate sources spatial variability in inputs and transformations across land use su et al 2016 tang 2015 recanatesi et al 2013 a variety of inputs such as atmospheric deposition agricultural fertilizer and soil nitrate could be the nonpoint nitrate sources of receiving water bodies zhang et al 2015 elliott et al 2007 kupkanchanakul et al 2015 kaushal et al 2010 nitrate can also be transformed by biogeochemical processes such as nitrification and denitrification burns et al 2009 li et al 2014 pohlert et al 2007 due to a diversity of nitrate sources in watersheds effective management is hard to implement liu et al 2013 thus a large amount of nonpoint nitrate is retained in watersheds leading to eutrophication fish death biodiversity reduction and ecosystem services degradation dodds et al 2009 chen et al 2015 yang et al 2016a dai et al 2016 therefore determining the nonpoint nitrate sources in watersheds is critical in developing effective nitrate reduction and mitigation strategies kaushal et al 2011 lecher et al 2015 stable isotope techniques which differentiate nitrate source signatures provides an effective way to identify a large number of sources anisfeld et al 2007 divers et al 2013 a dual isotope method with simultaneous analysis of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 has been widely used to determine the nitrate sources and constrain the nitrate transformation processes in aquatic environments ma and song 2016 liang et al 2013 yang and toor 2016 liu et al 2006 unlike most chemical tracers environmental isotopes are relatively conservative in reactions with catchment materials for example mean δ15n value in urea fertilizer is 0 18 1 27 mean δ15n value in nh4 fertilizer is 0 91 1 88 and mean δ15n value in no3 fertilizer is 2 75 0 76 most soils having δ15n values in the range of 2 to 5 tree tissues and litter have slightly lower δ15n values than soil most plants have δ 15n values in the range of 5 to 2 atmospheric nitrate has a large range of δ18o value from 25 to 80 nitrate produced by microbial nitrification has δ18o value in the range of 10 to 25 kendall 1998 kendall et al 2007 liu et al 2013 matiatos 2016 synthetic nitrate formed from atmospheric oxygen has a distinctive δ18o value of 18 to 22 sources such as atmospheric deposition synthetic nitrate fertilizer ammonium fertilizer have distinct nitrate isotopic characteristics which can potentially be preserved through the nitrogen cycle and be able to offer a direct means of source identification kendall 1998 li et al 2010 dejwakh et al 2012 nitrate isotopic compositions can also record transformations of nitrate during transport divers et al 2016 for example the enrichment of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 can provide clues about denitrification the expected ratio of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 is 1 1 2 1 kendall 1998 johannsen et al 2008 the dual isotopic method provides significant information to trace various sources and it is excellent in distinguishing the atmospheric nitrogen and synthetic nitrate fertilizer kendall et al 2007 however not all sources have mutually exclusive isotopic ranges due in large part to transformations within the environment which fractionate both δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 barnes et al 2010 for example the dual isotopic signatures usually partly overlap in nh4 fertilizer soil nh4 and manure therefore it is hard to distinguish all sources only using the dual isotope method kendall et al 2007 surface runoff is the main medium of transport for nonpoint source nitrate zhu et al 2015 pollutants from various sources are often transported into receiving water bodies through runoff process in suspended state and dissolved state he et al 2014 thus analyzing nitrogen from runoff can help assess their contribution to diffuse pollution based on land use however few study combined the advantages of both dual isotope and runoff analysis to better identify nonpoint source nitrate and understand transformation processes in the watershed kaushal et al 2011 in this study we combine dual nitrate isotope runoff and stream water monitoring methods and apply them in a small suburban watershed characterized with distinct seasons we aim to elucidate the nonpoint sources and processing of nitrate across space and time and to determine the main biogeochemical processes for nitrate export measuring δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 enables us to identify the dominant nitrate sources and determine the possible transformation sampling runoff based on land use allows us to focus on land use differences and address pollutants long term stream water quality monitoring studies helps address the spatial and temporal variability with these methods we ask three questions 1 what are the main sources of nitrate in the watershed soil septic waste manure fertilizer or atmospheric deposition 2 which land covers are most important in nitrate source export tea plantation forest residential area or transportation area 3 what are the main biogeochemical processes in the watershed nitrification denitrification or uptake 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area longhongjian stream located in hangzhou city china is one of the important sources of a world heritage site west lake it contains two streams mainstream ms and tributary tr the ms 2 8km originates from longjing spring and has five step ponds total area 29 790m2 for ecological restoration in the downstream the tributary 1 4km

2014 in the watershed approximately 70 of area is covered by mixed evergreen and deciduous broadleaf forest 20 by tea plantation and the rest are residential transportation area and water body according to our investigations ammonium and urea fertilizer co nh2 2 nh4hco3 and compound fertilizer containing n p are the primary chemical n fertilizer used in tea plantation in the watershed point source pollution has been controlled in the watershed while due to the impact of the nonpoint source pollution the nitrogen remains at a high level in the stream according to wang et al 2013 the mean concentration of tn is 6 45mg l and no3 is 4 92mg l in longhingjian stream which is much higher than that in the west lake until now few studies have been reported on the nitrate sources of the longhongjian stream it is critical to assess the sources of nitrate pollution to allow effective management of the stream and west lake 2 2 sampling and analyses 2 2 1 sampling fig 1 shows the

simultaneously at 5 10min intervals in the first 60min of storm events and then 30min intervals during the first 2h of each rain event the rainfall of each event was automatically collected through a self designed rainfall sampler at the time of all sampling the runoff flow was also measured with measuring bucket six rain sampling events were conducted during the period from july 2014 to august

nitrogen compounds no2 were presented at low concentrations with the mean values of 0 03 0 04mg l 1 respectively spatial and temporal variations of no3 and nh4 were shown in fig 2 the no3 variability responded to the typology of stream with higher values in the upper reaches in forest and tea plantation dominated area 8 12 1 90mg l 1 at w3 and 5 92 2 08mg l 1 at w1 and lower values in the outlets of step ponds 3 38 2 70mg l 1 at w9 and 3 21 2 47mg l 1 at w15 there were marked seasonal differences among no3 the no3 concentration was higher in spring and summer followed by autumn and winter while the higher nh4 concentrations were seen in winter and the lower nh4 concentrations were observed in rainy and warm seasons spring and summer 3 2 isotope characteristics of nitrate the values of δ15n no3 ranged between 3 9 and 7 3 with the mean value 1 2 3 44 and the values of δ18o no3 ranged from 5 6 and 15 4 with the mean value 10 0 3 23 table s3 the relationships between δ15n no3 and δ18o

concentrations but low δ15n no3 values generally occurred in the upstream of w1 and w4 and similar trends existed for no3 and δ15o no3 the δ15n no3 values downstream w2 w3 and w5 were enriched as compared to the upper reaches w1 and w4 the relatively low δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 were found in june while both δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 were generally enriched in august see the cycles in fig 3 3 3 runoff characteristics of nitrogen the runoff characteristics of nitrogen are shown based on four land use types in the watershed fig 4 and the detail is presented in the supplementary table table s1 the event mean concentrations emc of no3 were 6 38 1 05mg l 1 for the tea plantation 3 93 1 08mg l 1 for the forest 0 96 0 53mg l 1 for the residential area and 0 71 0 17mg l 1 for the transportation area no3 comprised a substantial proportion of the tn export in the tea plantation and forest the emc of nh4 and no2 in runoff were low 0 45 0 54mg l 1 and 0 02 0 02mg l 1 and did not show obvious differences in land uses in rainfall no3 nh4 and no2 were in low levels with emc 0 39 0 32mg l 1 0 41 0 45mg l 1 and 0 005 0 003mg l 1 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 denitrification in denitrification bacteria discriminate against heavier no3 isotope 15n which causes the 15n composition of no3 to increase as no3 concentration decreases reinhardt et al 2006 the denitrification process generates δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 ratio typically 1 1 to 2 1 kaushal et al 2011 in the present study an enrichment trend was not observed in δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 in the stream water and there is no significant relationship between the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values p 0 05 which demonstrates that no obvious denitrification occurred in stream water during the sampling period this conclusion is consistent with the sampling reaches condition which was a high oxygen and low carbon system denitrifying enzyme activity requires an o2 concentration below 0 2mg l 1 reinhardt et al 2006 while the mean o2 concentration was 10 22mg l 1 in the stream with minimum value 1 71mg l 1 in addition the relatively low availability of carbon codmn 3 55 1 43mg l 1 and bod5 0 75 0 76mg l 1 as well suggests that denitrification hardly occurred in the water column 4 2 nitrification nitrification is a two step microbial mediated process of nh4 oxidation to no3 with no2 as an intermediate product matiatos 2016 nitrification of nh4 results in preferential incorporation of the lighter isotopes into no3 and often leads to a decrease in δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 barnes et al 2010 nitrate derived from nitrification is usually with δ18o no3 in the range of 5 to 15 kendall et al 2007 in the present study all samples had low δ18o no3 signatures 15 4 indicating nh4 nitrification probably occurred in the watershed and no3 most likely originated from nitrification this is confirmed by the significant negative correlations between δ15n no3 and no3 concentration p 0 004 p 0 05 and between δ18o no3 and no3 concentration p 0 03 p 0 05 no3 via nitrification of nh4 results in isotopically lighter no3 to the total pool barnes et al 2010 since nitrification generally proceeds quickly and no2 has unstable chemical characteristics liu et al 2006 nh4 and no2 do not typically accumulate in high concentrations ipni 2016 davidson et al 1993 thus low values of nh4 and no2 were observed in the stream water 0 28 0 39mg l 1 and 0 03 0 04mg l 1 respectively seasonal differences in nh4 concentration as well provide evidence of the nitrification process across the watershed the highest nh4 concentrations in stream water were seen in winter fig 2 since the low temperature in winter limits the oxidation of nh4 and dry period limits delivery of nh4 to the soil microbial community welter et al 2005 therefore a high nitrification rate usually occurs in rainy and warm season davidson et al 1993 this is reasonable that the lower nh4 concentrations were observed in spring and summer in the longhongjian stream fig 2 4 3 uptake high nitrate retention capacity often occurs when and where hydrophytes grow well chen et al 2010 it has been reported that plants generally prefer to incorporate 14n over 15n reinhardt et al 2006 the remaining nitrate in water would therefore be enriched with heavy isotopes during the assimilation thus an isotopic fractionation occurs fox and papanicolaou 2008 in this study no3 concentrations decreased significantly after passing through the step ponds fig 2 step ponds effectively retained nitrate in the downstreams of ms and tr and largely decreased the nitrate export the reaches located in step ponds had relatively high δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values and low no3 concentrations w3 and w5 fig 3 these reaches were characterized with high vegetation coverage which indicates that plant uptake resulted in the rise of isotopic composition and the decrease of no3 concentration in the step ponds danielescu et al 2013 uptake is expected to be greatest during the plant growing season battaglin et al 2001 and plants incorporating lighter no3 results in 15n enrichment therefore δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 were enriched in summer in the present study fig 3 4 4 nitrate sources nitrate was the dominant composition of nitrogen in longhongjian stream suggesting the importance of studying no3 sources in the longhongjian watershed temporal and spatial variations reflect that no3 was impacted by nonpoint source pollution higher no3 concentrations were observed in spring and summer because the increase of runoff in the rainy season from april to august accelerates nonpoint no3 sources flushed into the stream higher no3 values were shown in the forest and tea plantation dominated areas w1 w2 w3 and w10 fig 2 the area of tea plantation is 22 of the watershed and the area of forest is around 62 of the watershed according to runoff analysis much higher no3 concentrations in runoff were found in the forest and tea plantation emc 6 38mg l 1 for tea plantation 3 93mg l 1 for forest fig 4 these evidences illustrated that no3 in the tea plantation and forest comprised a substantial proportion of the tn export therefore the tea plantation and forest were the main nonpoint sources of no3 in the watershed runoff analysis as well showed that the transportation and residential areas contribute little to no3 pollution of stream water fig 4 which indicated that people s daily activity and tour did not cause no3 pollution lower no3 values in the step ponds w9 and w15 indicate the step ponds played a critical role in retaining no3 due to plant uptake fig 2 the relationships between ions and ec can be used to study the water characteristics and mineralization sources jin et al 2015 according to kemker 2014 normal ec comes from the surrounding geology in streams and rivers and clay soil and groundwater generally elevates ec levels spearman s correlation shows that ec and sal have a positive correlation with no3 p 0 00 0 05 since clay is the main composition of soil in the longhongjian watershed dong 2001 and high no3 concentration was reported in the groundwater in west lake watershed jin et al 2015 dong 2001 it can be concluded that clay soil and groundwater might be the sources of no3 in the longhongjian stream watershed it is consistent with the previous report that groundwater is an important vector of n transport to streams böhlke and denver 1995 kaushal et al 2011 high levels of cl have been detected in sewage and manure effluent yao et al 2007 in the present watershed the low cl concentrations illustrates that manure had little influence in water quality of the stream and was not the main source of nitrate a small amount of manure is usually applied in the tea plantations in autumn but no significant nitrate concentration rise was observed in autumn which also provides evidence of the absence of manure pollution large variations of δ18o no3 are usually derived from atmospheric deposition generally from 25 to 75 and no3 fertilizer from 17 to 25 kendall et al 2007 liang et al 2013 in this study the values of the δ18o no3 were low 5 6 to 15 4 and the variation profile was relatively narrow suggesting that neither atmospheric no3 nor no3 fertilizer were the major sources of no3 in the stream fig 5 spatial variation of nitrate isotope can be attributed to the land use types and anthropogenic activities ohte et al 2010 yue et al 2014 temporal variation of nitrate isotope can be attributed to inherent differences in nitrification and biological uptake through time and changes of nitrate in the mixing ratios between sources barnes and raymond 2010 as seen from dual δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 source plots fig 5 the nitrate isotope values in june fell in the range typically cited as representing nh4 in fertilizer and precipitation sources according to rainfall analysis both no3 and nh4 concentrations stayed at low levels fig 4 therefore rainfall did not contribute to nitrogen pollution of the stream water nh4hco3 co nh2 2 and compound fertilizer n p were found to be the primary chemical n fertilizers used in tea plantations in spring thus nitrate nitrified from nh4 fertilizer was the major no3 source in spring samples in october december and august fell into the overlapping area of nh4 n in fertilizer and precipitation soil nh4 and manure and septic waste source categories as discussed before manure was not the main source of no3 soil nh4 is a product of bacterial decomposition of organic nitrogen that results from decomposition of plants and animals and their waste danielescu and macquarrie 2013 lower δ15n no3 values in w1 and w4 may reflect the mineralization of soil organic matter ostrom et al 1998 surface soil beneath bushes and trees often have lower δ15n no3 values than those in open areas presumably as the result of litter deposition kendall et al 2007 in this study litter fall could be the significant septic waste due to the high vegetation coverage in the watershed thus nh4 fertilizer soil nh4 and litter fall are considered to be the main sources of no3 in the watershed 5 conclusions in this study nh4 fertilizer soil nh4 litter fall and groundwater were identified as the main sources of nitrate contributing to high nitrate export in the longhongjian watershed spatial nitrate variability was attributed to land use variation and ecological retention temporal nitrate variability was due to variation in anthropogenic activities and biogeochemical processes microbial nitrification and plant uptake step ponds in this study played an important role in retaining nitrate in the downstreams overall results from this study have two main management implications for effectively mitigating nonpoint source nitrate pollution focus must be placed on prioritizing management strategies based on contribution of sources across land use intercepting nitrate along hydrologic flow paths near streams may be an efficient way to regulate watershed nitrate exports and sustainable land use management kaushal et al 2011 some retention projects such as forestry and agricultural bmps vegetated ponds ditches and buffers etc are recommended to reduce nitrate exports yang et al 2016b furthermore groundwater contamination in the headwater needs to be addressed in order to reduce the no3 transport downstream and ultimately to the west lake our study indicates that combination of the dual isotopic method with both runoff and stream water monitoring and chemical analysis is effective way to identify the specific nonpoint nitrate sources across land use and illustrate the potential nitrate transformations in the watershed results of this study could be helpful to design management strategies to reduce nonpoint source

7411,identifying nonpoint sources of nitrate has been a long term challenge in mixed land use watershed in the present study we combine dual nitrate isotope runoff and stream water monitoring to elucidate the nonpoint nitrate sources across land use and determine the relative importance of biogeochemical processes for nitrate export in a small suburban watershed longhongjian watershed china our study suggested that nh4 fertilizer soil nh4 litter fall and groundwater were the main nitrate sources in longhongjian stream there were large changes in nitrate sources in response to season and land use runoff analysis illustrated that the tea plantation and forest areas contributed to a dominated proportion of the tn export spatial analysis illustrated that no3 concentration was high in the tea plantation and forest areas and δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 were enriched in the step ponds temporal analysis showed high no3 level in spring and nitrate isotopes were enriched in summer study as well showed that the step ponds played an important role in mitigating nitrate pollution nitrification and plant uptake were the significant biogeochemical processes contributing to the nitrogen transformation and denitrification hardly occurred in the stream keywords nitrate isotopes biogeochemical processes runoff source identification land use 1 introduction identifying nonpoint sources of nitrate in mixed land use watershed has been a long term challenge since the sources of nitrate in watersheds are complex due to mixing of different nitrate sources spatial variability in inputs and transformations across land use su et al 2016 tang 2015 recanatesi et al 2013 a variety of inputs such as atmospheric deposition agricultural fertilizer and soil nitrate could be the nonpoint nitrate sources of receiving water bodies zhang et al 2015 elliott et al 2007 kupkanchanakul et al 2015 kaushal et al 2010 nitrate can also be transformed by biogeochemical processes such as nitrification and denitrification burns et al 2009 li et al 2014 pohlert et al 2007 due to a diversity of nitrate sources in watersheds effective management is hard to implement liu et al 2013 thus a large amount of nonpoint nitrate is retained in watersheds leading to eutrophication fish death biodiversity reduction and ecosystem services degradation dodds et al 2009 chen et al 2015 yang et al 2016a dai et al 2016 therefore determining the nonpoint nitrate sources in watersheds is critical in developing effective nitrate reduction and mitigation strategies kaushal et al 2011 lecher et al 2015 stable isotope techniques which differentiate nitrate source signatures provides an effective way to identify a large number of sources anisfeld et al 2007 divers et al 2013 a dual isotope method with simultaneous analysis of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 has been widely used to determine the nitrate sources and constrain the nitrate transformation processes in aquatic environments ma and song 2016 liang et al 2013 yang and toor 2016 liu et al 2006 unlike most chemical tracers environmental isotopes are relatively conservative in reactions with catchment materials for example mean δ15n value in urea fertilizer is 0 18 1 27 mean δ15n value in nh4 fertilizer is 0 91 1 88 and mean δ15n value in no3 fertilizer is 2 75 0 76 most soils having δ15n values in the range of 2 to 5 tree tissues and litter have slightly lower δ15n values than soil most plants have δ 15n values in the range of 5 to 2 atmospheric nitrate has a large range of δ18o value from 25 to 80 nitrate produced by microbial nitrification has δ18o value in the range of 10 to 25 kendall 1998 kendall et al 2007 liu et al 2013 matiatos 2016 synthetic nitrate formed from atmospheric oxygen has a distinctive δ18o value of 18 to 22 sources such as atmospheric deposition synthetic nitrate fertilizer ammonium fertilizer have distinct nitrate isotopic characteristics which can potentially be preserved through the nitrogen cycle and be able to offer a direct means of source identification kendall 1998 li et al 2010 dejwakh et al 2012 nitrate isotopic compositions can also record transformations of nitrate during transport divers et al 2016 for example the enrichment of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 can provide clues about denitrification the expected ratio of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 is 1 1 2 1 kendall 1998 johannsen et al 2008 the dual isotopic method provides significant information to trace various sources and it is excellent in distinguishing the atmospheric nitrogen and synthetic nitrate fertilizer kendall et al 2007 however not all sources have mutually exclusive isotopic ranges due in large part to transformations within the environment which fractionate both δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 barnes et al 2010 for example the dual isotopic signatures usually partly overlap in nh4 fertilizer soil nh4 and manure therefore it is hard to distinguish all sources only using the dual isotope method kendall et al 2007 surface runoff is the main medium of transport for nonpoint source nitrate zhu et al 2015 pollutants from various sources are often transported into receiving water bodies through runoff process in suspended state and dissolved state he et al 2014 thus analyzing nitrogen from runoff can help assess their contribution to diffuse pollution based on land use however few study combined the advantages of both dual isotope and runoff analysis to better identify nonpoint source nitrate and understand transformation processes in the watershed kaushal et al 2011 in this study we combine dual nitrate isotope runoff and stream water monitoring methods and apply them in a small suburban watershed characterized with distinct seasons we aim to elucidate the nonpoint sources and processing of nitrate across space and time and to determine the main biogeochemical processes for nitrate export measuring δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 enables us to identify the dominant nitrate sources and determine the possible transformation sampling runoff based on land use allows us to focus on land use differences and address pollutants long term stream water quality monitoring studies helps address the spatial and temporal variability with these methods we ask three questions 1 what are the main sources of nitrate in the watershed soil septic waste manure fertilizer or atmospheric deposition 2 which land covers are most important in nitrate source export tea plantation forest residential area or transportation area 3 what are the main biogeochemical processes in the watershed nitrification denitrification or uptake 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area longhongjian stream located in hangzhou city china is one of the important sources of a world heritage site west lake it contains two streams mainstream ms and tributary tr the ms 2 8km originates from longjing spring and has five step ponds total area 29 790m2 for ecological restoration in the downstream the tributary 1 4km originating from yuegui mountain has four step ponds 24 237 m2 downstream wiap 2015 the longhongjian watershed has a suburban humid climate and four distinct seasons during the study period 2013 2015 the annual mean temperature was 17 c ranging from 4 4 c in december to 41 6 c in august ccrh 2014 the total annual precipitation was 1520 9mm and the rainy season ranges from april to september ccrh 2014 in the watershed approximately 70 of area is covered by mixed evergreen and deciduous broadleaf forest 20 by tea plantation and the rest are residential transportation area and water body according to our investigations ammonium and urea fertilizer co nh2 2 nh4hco3 and compound fertilizer containing n p are the primary chemical n fertilizer used in tea plantation in the watershed point source pollution has been controlled in the watershed while due to the impact of the nonpoint source pollution the nitrogen remains at a high level in the stream according to wang et al 2013 the mean concentration of tn is 6 45mg l and no3 is 4 92mg l in longhingjian stream which is much higher than that in the west lake until now few studies have been reported on the nitrate sources of the longhongjian stream it is critical to assess the sources of nitrate pollution to allow effective management of the stream and west lake 2 2 sampling and analyses 2 2 1 sampling fig 1 shows the locations of the sampling reaches fifteen stream water sampling reaches w1 w15 are established nine in the ms and six in the tr w1 w2 w3 and w4 are located upstream of the ms the major water at w4 is

a b c and d were established based on land use fig 1 a is set at a forest area b is at a tea plantation c is at a residential area and d is on a road sampling was manually conducted at four stations simultaneously at 5 10min intervals in the first 60min of storm events and then 30min intervals during the first 2h of each rain event the rainfall of each event was automatically collected through a self designed rainfall sampler at the time of all sampling the runoff flow was also measured with measuring bucket six rain sampling events were conducted during the period from july 2014 to august 2015 details in table s1 runoff and rainfall were collected in 500ml polyethylene bottles for chemical analysis all samples were transported to the laboratory and conserved at 4 c for further analysis

meter hach hq30d electrical conductivity ec mscm 1 and salinity sal ppt were measured with a portable conductivity meter mettler toledo sg23 in the laboratory the water samples were filtered through 0 45μm membrane filters first except tn and codmn analysis and the water chemical parameters were determined following the officially recommended methods of analysis sepa 2002a the quality assurance and quality control qa qc were followed to ensure that the data are of high quality and reproducibility the parameters analyzed in the stream water samples were total nitrogen tn mg l 1 nitrate no3 mg l 1 nitrite no2 mg l 1 ammonium nh4 mg l 1 chemical oxygen demand codmn mg l 1 biochemical oxygen demand bod5 mg l 1 and chloride cl 1 mg l 1 isotopic analysis of nitrate was performed using agno3 method silva et al 2000 li et al 2010 by which nitrate was converted to agno3 the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values were determined using elemental analysis isotope ratio mass spectrometry ea irms and reported in the δ notation relative to air n2 and the standard mean ocean water smow in permil the stable isotope ratios were expressed in delta δ units and a per mil notation as 1 δ r sample r standard r standdard 1000 where r represents the 15n 14n or 18o 16o ratios respectively values of δ15n no3 were reported relative to n2 in atmospheric air air and δ18o no3 values were reported relative to vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow the parameters analyzed in the runoff and rainfall were total nitrogen tn mg l 1 nitrate no3 mg l 1 nitrite no2 mg l 1 and ammonium nh4 mg l 1 the event mean concentration emc representing a flow weighted mean concentration is an important quantitative parameter for evaluating the effects of rainfall runoff on receiving waters yang et al 2016b emc was calculated as 2 emc c i q i q i where c is the nutrient concentration q is the runoff and i is the time step 3 results 3 1 hydrochemical characteristics of stream water the hydrochemical parameters of stream water samples during the sampling campaign from 2013 to 2015 are summarized in the supplementary table table s2 the surface water temperature profoundly influenced by changing climate ranged from 5 7 to 33 9 c the do values were high and the mean o2 concentration was 10 22mg l 1 codmn bod5 and cl 1 remained at low levels with mean values of 3 55 1 43mg l 1 0 75 0 76mg l 1 and 8 39 3 29mg l 1 respectively the values of ec and sal were high and have a positive correlation with no3 p 0 000 0 05 tn levels with values 5 87 3 15mg l 1 at all sampling reaches far exceeded the water quality standard type v in china tn 2 0mg l 1 sepa 2002b no3 showed significant relationship with tn p 0 000 0 05 and selected stream locations showed a high variance of nitrate concentrations the no3 concentration ranged from 0 04 to 19 40mg l 1 with a mean concentration of 4 96 2 94mg l 1 the variance of nh4 ranged from 0 02mg l 1 to 3 64mg l 1 with a mean concentration of 0 28 0 39mg l 1 another nitrogen compounds no2 were presented at low concentrations with the mean values of 0 03 0 04mg l 1 respectively spatial and temporal variations of no3 and nh4 were shown in fig 2 the no3 variability responded to the typology of stream with higher values in the upper reaches in forest and tea plantation dominated area 8 12 1 90mg l 1 at w3 and 5 92 2 08mg l 1 at w1 and lower values in the outlets of step ponds 3 38 2 70mg l 1 at w9 and 3 21 2 47mg l 1 at w15 there were marked seasonal differences among no3 the no3 concentration was higher in spring and summer followed by autumn and winter while the higher nh4 concentrations were seen in winter and the lower nh4 concentrations were observed in rainy and warm seasons spring and summer 3 2 isotope characteristics of nitrate the values of δ15n no3 ranged between 3 9 and 7 3 with the mean value 1 2 3 44 and the values of δ18o no3 ranged from 5 6 and 15 4 with the mean value 10 0 3 23 table s3 the relationships between δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 and no3 concentration are reported in fig 3 there is negative correlation between δ15n no3 and no3 concentration p 0 004 0 005 and δ18o no3 and no3 concentration p 0 03 0 05 high no3 concentrations but low δ15n no3 values generally occurred in the upstream of w1 and w4 and similar trends existed for no3 and δ15o no3 the δ15n no3 values downstream w2 w3 and w5 were enriched as compared to the upper reaches w1 and w4 the relatively low δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 were found in june while both δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 were generally enriched in august see the cycles in fig 3 3 3 runoff characteristics of nitrogen the runoff characteristics of nitrogen are shown based on four land use types in the watershed fig 4 and the detail is presented in the supplementary table table s1 the event mean concentrations emc of no3 were 6 38 1 05mg l 1 for the tea plantation 3 93 1 08mg l 1 for the forest 0 96 0 53mg l 1 for the residential area and 0 71 0 17mg l 1 for the transportation area no3 comprised a substantial proportion of the tn export in the tea plantation and forest the emc of nh4 and no2 in runoff were low 0 45 0 54mg l 1 and 0 02 0 02mg l 1 and did not show obvious differences in land uses in rainfall no3 nh4 and no2 were in low levels with emc 0 39 0 32mg l 1 0 41 0 45mg l 1 and 0 005 0 003mg l 1 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 denitrification in denitrification bacteria discriminate against heavier no3 isotope 15n which causes the 15n composition of no3 to increase as no3 concentration decreases reinhardt et al 2006 the denitrification process generates δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 ratio typically 1 1 to 2 1 kaushal et al 2011 in the present study an enrichment trend was not observed in δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 in the stream water and there is no significant relationship between the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values p 0 05 which demonstrates that no obvious denitrification occurred in stream water during the sampling period this conclusion is consistent with the sampling reaches condition which was a high oxygen and low carbon system denitrifying enzyme activity requires an o2 concentration below 0 2mg l 1 reinhardt et al 2006 while the mean o2 concentration was 10 22mg l 1 in the stream with minimum value 1 71mg l 1 in addition the relatively low availability of carbon codmn 3 55 1 43mg l 1 and bod5 0 75 0 76mg l 1 as well suggests that denitrification hardly occurred in the water column 4 2 nitrification nitrification is a two step microbial mediated process of nh4 oxidation to no3 with no2 as an intermediate product matiatos 2016 nitrification of nh4 results in preferential incorporation of the lighter isotopes into no3 and often leads to a decrease in δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 barnes et al 2010 nitrate derived from nitrification is usually with δ18o no3 in the range of 5 to 15 kendall et al 2007 in the present study all samples had low δ18o no3 signatures 15 4 indicating nh4 nitrification probably occurred in the watershed and no3 most likely originated from nitrification this is confirmed by the significant negative correlations between δ15n no3 and no3 concentration p 0 004 p 0 05 and between δ18o no3 and no3 concentration p 0 03 p 0 05 no3 via nitrification of nh4 results in isotopically lighter no3 to the total pool barnes et al 2010 since nitrification generally proceeds quickly and no2 has unstable chemical characteristics liu et al 2006 nh4 and no2 do not typically accumulate in high concentrations ipni 2016 davidson et al 1993 thus low values of nh4 and no2 were observed in the stream water 0 28 0 39mg l 1 and 0 03 0 04mg l 1 respectively seasonal differences in nh4 concentration as well provide evidence of the nitrification process across the watershed the highest nh4 concentrations in stream water were seen in winter fig 2 since the low temperature in winter limits the oxidation of nh4 and dry period limits delivery of nh4 to the soil microbial community welter et al 2005 therefore a high nitrification rate usually occurs in rainy and warm season davidson et al 1993 this is reasonable that the lower nh4 concentrations were observed in spring and summer in the longhongjian stream fig 2 4 3 uptake high nitrate retention capacity often occurs when and where hydrophytes grow well chen et al 2010 it has been reported that plants generally prefer to incorporate 14n over 15n reinhardt et al 2006 the remaining nitrate in water would therefore be enriched with heavy isotopes during the assimilation thus an isotopic fractionation occurs fox and papanicolaou 2008 in this study no3 concentrations decreased significantly after passing through the step ponds fig 2 step ponds effectively retained nitrate in the downstreams of ms and tr and largely decreased the nitrate export the reaches located in step ponds had relatively high δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values and low no3 concentrations w3 and w5 fig 3 these reaches were characterized with high vegetation coverage which indicates that plant uptake resulted in the rise of isotopic composition and the decrease of no3 concentration in the step ponds danielescu et al 2013 uptake is expected to be greatest during the plant growing season battaglin et al 2001 and plants incorporating lighter no3 results in 15n enrichment therefore δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 were enriched in summer in the present study fig 3 4 4 nitrate sources nitrate was the dominant composition of nitrogen in longhongjian stream suggesting the importance of studying no3 sources in the longhongjian watershed temporal and spatial variations reflect that no3 was impacted by nonpoint source pollution higher no3 concentrations were observed in spring and summer because the increase of runoff in the rainy season from april to august accelerates nonpoint no3 sources flushed into the stream higher no3 values were shown in the forest and tea plantation dominated areas w1 w2 w3 and w10 fig 2 the area of tea plantation is 22 of the watershed and the area of forest is around 62 of the watershed according to runoff analysis much higher no3 concentrations in runoff were found in the forest and tea plantation emc 6 38mg l 1 for tea plantation 3 93mg l 1 for forest fig 4 these evidences illustrated that no3 in the tea plantation and forest comprised a substantial proportion of the tn export therefore the tea plantation and forest were the main nonpoint sources of no3 in the watershed runoff analysis as well showed that the transportation and residential areas contribute little to no3 pollution of stream water fig 4 which indicated that people s daily activity and tour did not cause no3 pollution lower no3 values in the step ponds w9 and w15 indicate the step ponds played a critical role in retaining no3 due to plant uptake fig 2 the relationships between ions and ec can be used to study the water characteristics and mineralization sources jin et al 2015 according to kemker 2014 normal ec comes from the surrounding geology in streams and rivers and clay soil and groundwater generally elevates ec levels spearman s correlation shows that ec and sal have a positive correlation with no3 p 0 00 0 05 since clay is the main composition of soil in the longhongjian watershed dong 2001 and high no3 concentration was reported in the groundwater in west lake watershed jin et al 2015 dong 2001 it can be concluded that clay soil and groundwater might be the sources of no3 in the longhongjian stream watershed it is consistent with the previous report that groundwater is an important vector of n transport to streams böhlke and denver 1995 kaushal et al 2011 high levels of cl have been detected in sewage and manure effluent yao et al 2007 in the present watershed the low cl concentrations illustrates that manure had little influence in water quality of the stream and was not the main source of nitrate a small amount of manure is usually applied in the tea plantations in autumn but no significant nitrate concentration rise was observed in autumn which also provides evidence of the absence of manure pollution large variations of δ18o no3 are usually derived from atmospheric deposition generally from 25 to 75 and no3 fertilizer from 17 to 25 kendall et al 2007 liang et al 2013 in this study the values of the δ18o no3 were low 5 6 to 15 4 and the variation profile was relatively narrow suggesting that neither atmospheric no3 nor no3 fertilizer were the major sources of no3 in the stream fig 5 spatial variation of nitrate isotope can be attributed to the land use types and anthropogenic activities ohte et al 2010 yue et al 2014 temporal variation of nitrate isotope can be attributed to inherent differences in nitrification and biological uptake through time and changes of nitrate in the mixing ratios between sources barnes and raymond 2010 as seen from dual δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 source plots fig 5 the nitrate isotope values in june fell in the range typically cited as representing nh4 in fertilizer and precipitation sources according to rainfall analysis both no3 and nh4 concentrations stayed at low levels fig 4 therefore rainfall did not contribute to nitrogen pollution of the stream water nh4hco3 co nh2 2 and compound fertilizer n p were found to be the primary chemical n fertilizers used in tea plantations in spring thus nitrate nitrified from nh4 fertilizer was the major no3 source in spring samples in october december and august fell into the overlapping area of nh4 n in fertilizer and precipitation soil nh4 and manure and septic waste source categories as discussed before manure was not the main source of no3 soil nh4 is a product of bacterial decomposition of organic nitrogen that results from decomposition of plants and animals and their waste danielescu and macquarrie 2013 lower δ15n no3 values in w1 and w4 may reflect the mineralization of soil organic matter ostrom et al 1998 surface soil beneath bushes and trees often have lower δ15n no3 values than those in open areas presumably as the result of litter deposition kendall et al 2007 in this study litter fall could be the significant septic waste due to the high vegetation coverage in the watershed thus nh4 fertilizer soil nh4 and litter fall are considered to be the main sources of no3 in the watershed 5 conclusions in this study nh4 fertilizer soil nh4 litter fall and groundwater were identified as the main sources of nitrate contributing to high nitrate export in the longhongjian watershed spatial nitrate variability was attributed to land use variation and ecological retention temporal nitrate variability was due to variation in anthropogenic activities and biogeochemical processes microbial nitrification and plant uptake step ponds in this study played an important role in retaining nitrate in the downstreams overall results from this study have two main management implications for effectively mitigating nonpoint source nitrate pollution focus must be placed on prioritizing management strategies based on contribution of sources across land use intercepting nitrate along hydrologic flow paths near streams may be an efficient way to regulate watershed nitrate exports and sustainable land use management kaushal et al 2011 some retention projects such as forestry and agricultural bmps vegetated ponds ditches and buffers etc are recommended to reduce nitrate exports yang et al 2016b furthermore groundwater contamination in the headwater needs to be addressed in order to reduce the no3 transport downstream and ultimately to the west lake our study indicates that combination of the dual isotopic method with both runoff and stream water monitoring and chemical analysis is effective way to identify the specific nonpoint nitrate sources across land use and illustrate the potential nitrate transformations in the watershed results of this study could be helpful to design management strategies to reduce nonpoint source

7412,climate change is nowadays widely considered to have major effects on groundwater resources climatic projections suggest a global increase in evaporation and higher frequency of strong rainfall events especially in mediterranean context since evaporation is synonym of low recharge conditions whereas strong rainfall events are more favourable to recharge in heterogeneous subsurface contexts a lack of knowledge remains then on the real ongoing and future drinking groundwater supply availability at aquifers scale due to low recharge potential and high inter annual climate variability this issue is strategic for the mediterranean hydrosystems this is especially the case for coastal aquifers because they are exposed to seawater intrusion sea level rise and overpumping risks in this context recharge processes and rates were investigated in a mediterranean coastal aquifer with subsurface heterogeneity located in southern corsica france aquifer recharge rates from combining ten physical and chemical methods were computed in addition hydrochemical and isotopic investigations were carried out through a monthly two years monitoring combining major ions and stable isotopes of water in rain runoff and groundwater diffuse focused lateral mountain system and irrigation recharge processes were identified and characterized a predominant focused recharge conditioned by subsurface heterogeneity is evidenced in agreement with variable but highly favourable recharge rates the fast water transfer from the surface to the aquifer implied by this recharge process suggests less evaporation which means higher groundwater renewal and availability in such mediterranean coastal aquifers keywords aquifer recharge rainfall hydrochemistry stable isotopes water management 1 introduction groundwaters represent up to 33 of total water withdrawals around the world and are already widely overexploited gleeson et al 2012 famiglietti 2014 climate spatial temporal variability and change influences groundwater systems directly through renewal by recharge and indirectly by changes in groundwater use taylor et al 2013a the renewal of groundwater occurs from many recharge processes which are strongly dependant on climate land cover and geology richts et al 2011 jaunat et al 2016 climate and land cover govern precipitation and evapotranspiration whereas geology determines water transmission through the soil and storage from the surface and subsurface to aquifers between the global scale and the basin site specific studies connecting groundwater recharge and climatic projections a lack of knowledge remains concerning the understanding of specific recharge processes within a given region since studies of recharge often display different types of recharge meixner et al 2016 defined four main recharge processes to ease comparative analysis in the western united states thus they distinguish diffuse focused mountain system recharge msr and irrigation recharge coupling climate projections with detailed recharge process based models may thus contribute to reduce aquifer recharge rate estimates uncertainty in predicting aquifer recharge scenarios recently hartmann et al 2017 showed that regions with developed subsurface heterogeneity enhance recharge rates due to a different sensitivity facing climate change compared to more homogeneous regions according to hartmann et al 2017 the concept of heterogeneity refers to hydraulic conductivities storage capacities and porosities the ensuing findings indicate that the water balance of mediterranean and desert heterogeneous areas will be less dominated by evapotranspiration than regions with homogeneous subsurface because water is rapidly passed downward to guarantee water resources sustainability constraining aquifer recharge rates and recharge processes is consequently strategic especially when recharge conditions are low such as under semi arid or mediterranean climate this is especially the case for coastal aquifers which are highly vulnerable to climate change because exposed to seawater intrusion linked to low recharge conditions sea level rise and overpumping risks lee et al 2006 dhar and datta 2009 javadi et al 2015 as a part of the western mediterranean area considered as a climate change hotspot pachauri et al 2014 the corsica island france is a strategic place to constrain recharge processes and associated amounts under high climatic pressure located at the south of the island the bonifacio coastal aquifer has been selected for such a study because the geology and the hydrogeology are well documented and evidenced a noticeable subsurface heterogeneity mcdonnell et al 2007 orsini et al 2010 reynaud et al 2012 santoni et al 2016a b c in addition since a msr and a diffuse recharge have been described in santoni et al 2016b and considering the presence of multiple irrigated vegetable patches all the 4 recharge processes described previously are suspected to occur at the same time even if the study site is little extended insofar as no seawater intrusion is yet detected in the bonifacio aquifer santoni et al 2016a major ions and stable isotopes of the water molecule seemed very suitable to study the recharge because they are able to give insight into the source and timing of recharge de vries and simmers 2002 scanlon et al 2002 fernandez chacon et al 2010 florea 2013 a monthly two years monitoring approach combining major ions and stable isotopes of water in rain runoff and groundwater was carried out from february 2013 to march 2015 to try to study as accurate as possible the recharge processes aquifer recharge rate estimation are presented from 10 physical and chemical methods for the last three decades before a description of the chemistry and the isotope content in rain runoff and groundwaters then the recharge processes from hydrochemistry and isotope tools are identified characterized and prioritized finally the climatic and recharge rates trends are discussed regarding the recharge processes evidenced to infer trends on the ongoing and future water resource availability of mediterranean coastal aquifers 2 study area 2 1 location and climate the bonifacio plateau is located in the southern part of the corsica island fig 1 the region is under a typical mediterranean climate characterized by highly heterogeneous temperature and rain conditions from one year to another one lionello et al 2006 bolle 2012 it is also classified by the köppen geiger criteria peel et al 2007 as a so called csa climate temperate climate with a dry summer the mean annual temperature and precipitation at the bonifacio météo france station capo pertusato fig 1 are 16 8 c and 605 mm respectively calculated from 01 2000 to 01 2012 the sector of bonifacio is also known for its wind blowing up to 300 days per year often with gusts above 60 80 km h causing heavy swell and generating significant sea sprays all over the region the study site is bounded in equal proportions by granites at the east and the west and by the tyrrhenian sea at the northeast and the mediterranean sea at the south fig 1 its triangular shape extends over an area of 25 km2 with a mean elevation of 80 m asl the miocene carbonate deposits fill a granitic depression up to 270 m deep and are in contact with granitic relief of an altitude up to 243 m at the monte corbu west side and 113 m at the punta di san mulari east side the bonifacio plateau is cut by four east west oriented valleys st jean st julien canettu and canali the canali river is the only permanent river with very low flow during summer and takes its source on the granitic massifs before crossing the plateau in direction of the sant amanza bay many streams may appear temporary within the four valleys and also in contact with the granites massifs during high rainfall events this is especially the case for paraguano and parmentile temporary streams located at the north west interface of the plateau with the granites fig 1 the 3000 inhabitants of bonifacio reside mainly around the harbour and along the saint julien and saint jean valleys various villas and campgrounds are spread over the plateau some scarce agricultural activities like market gardening and cattle breeding are found at the centre of the plateau the rest of the area being covered by abandoned agricultural land and mediterranean maquis 2 2 geology the bonifacio aquifer is developed in a sedimentary miocene basin and lies on a granitic depression fig 1 from the base to the top the bonifacio sedimentary basin is composed of the balistra calcareous gravelly sands the cala di labra shelly litharenites and the bonifacio calcareous fine grained sandy litharenite formations ferrandini 2003 orsini et al 2010 reynaud et al 2012 the fraction of calcite also increases to the top of the series as the fraction of weathering products from the surrounding granites decreases a sandy silt level within the cala di labra formation materializes the separation between the upper and the lower aquifer the granitic bedrock and the sedimentary sequences as a cross section are described in more extended details in santoni et al 2016b the lithology and the structure of the basin suggests clearly a well developed heterogeneity with respect to porosities and water storage capacities the granitic bedrock and the bonifacio basin displays also high heterogeneity due to their intense fracturation fractures north south and northeast southwest oriented affects principally the granites whereas fractures east west oriented affects both the bedrock and the sedimentary basin dörfliger et al 2002 gattacceca et al 2007 oudet et al 2010 reynaud et al 2012 2 3 hydrogeology background the coastal aquifer hosted by the carbonated sediments represents the only available local groundwater resource in southern corsica this region faces also an important touristic activity in summer and additional surface water resources coming from dams located further north are then necessary the bonifacio aquifer is composed of two main aquifer levels separated by the silty layer of the cala di labra formation the thick unsaturated zone up to 50 m in the centre of the plateau is a major characteristic of the aquifer environmental tracers allowed assessing mineralization processes and three groundwater types are observed 1 a ca hco3 water type in the upper aquifer conditioned by carbonate dissolution 2 a na cl water type in the granites due to sea sprays favoured by the winds and 3 an intermediate ca na cl water type in the lower aquifer conditioned by the mixing of groundwater from the upper aquifer and granites santoni et al 2016a some groundwater samples show noticeable nitrate concentrations up to 40 mg l highlighting the vulnerability of the aquifer regarding human activities such as irrigation of gardens and individual sewage treatment plants istp groundwater residence time estimations shows weighted ages from 0 to 50 a in the upper aquifer and from 35 to 60 a in the lower aquifer indicating a relatively low dynamic of renewal santoni et al 2016c two flow patterns are identified 1 an autochthonous vertical recharge of the upper aquifer with an aging from the centre of the plateau to the shores bonifacio harbour and sant amanza is observed and consistent with the potentiometric heads and 2 an allochthonous lateral recharge of the lower aquifer via the surrounding fractured granites santoni et al 2016c hydraulic conductivities range from 1 4 to 2 2 10 6 m s in the upper aquifer and from 2 1 to 4 9 10 6 m s in the lower aquifer dörfliger et al 2002 santoni et al 2016c highlighting the heterogeneity of the aquifer also with respect to hydraulic conductivities an approach using 87sr 86sr allowed to validate and compute the mixing rates between the granites the upper and the lower aquifer two outlets are possible for groundwater 1 anthropogenic around 180 000 m3 year of groundwater are taken for drinking water supply needs and 2 natural through the submarine groundwater discharge santoni et al 2016b in situ 224 223ra and 222rn measurements along the coastline display low activities thus reflecting low discharge conditions the main discharge points were found in the bonifacio harbour and in sant amanza bay fig 1 in agreement with low temperatures observed using thermal infrared images garel et al 2015 3 method 3 1 aquifer recharge rates estimation the existing methods in the literature to estimate aquifer recharge rates vary in terms of nature and scale and includes physical chemical isotopic and modelling techniques lerner et al 1990 hendrickx and walker 1997 zhang and walker 1998 kinzelbach et al 2002 scanlon et al 2002 to achieve realistic estimation and confidence interval it is strategic to use as much as possible long datasets chronicles and to consider different approaches that complement and support each other scanlon et al 2006 in this way we computed the aquifer recharge rates from using the espere v1 5 multiple method excel sheet application lanini et al 2016 which allows aquifer recharge rates and aquifer recharge estimations from using several common methods we applied the empirical methods of guttman 1947 turc 1954 and kessler 1965 the soil water balance methods swb proposed by thornthwaite 1948 improved by dingman 2002 and the water table fluctuation wtf method proposed by delin et al 2007 for the implementation of the espere v1 5 excel sheet we used the daily temperature c daily rainfall amount mm and daily potential evapotranspiration pet mm provided by the météo france weather station of bonifacio pertusato ref 20041001 for the 01 1980 12 2014 period the daily water table levels necessary for the wtf method were provided by a ott diver ctd device placed in the borehole cam2 b3 recharge area during the 05 2011 12 2014 period the chloride mass balance cmb method was computed for the 01 2013 12 2014 period according to eriksson and khunakasem 1969 the mean annual rainfall amount was provided by the météo france station of bonifacio and the monthly chloride concentrations in rainwater and groundwater from the rain gauge and the borehole at cam2 b3 recharge area the safran isba modcou sim hydrometeorological model is provided by météo france and consists of a combination of a meteorological analysis system safran a land surface model isba and a hydrogeological model modcou habets et al 2008 values for the bonifacio station were extracted from the météo france data base for the 01 2013 12 2014 period 3 2 hydrochemistry and isotope composition of waters 3 2 1 sampling network rain runoff and groundwater from 15 boreholes up to 270 m deep 5 wells and 4 springs fig 1 of the surrounding granites the lower and the upper aquifer levels of the carbonate plateau were monthly sampled from february 2013 to march 2015 for in situ parameters temperature ph electrical conductivity and alkalinity major ions and δ18o and δ2h the screening interval of the boreholes and wells is 31 269 m and 5 15 m respectively runoff samples are canr r1 and canr r2 samples from the upper aquifer in the recharge area are sba b14 cpo b10 cam2 b3 canp w5 negp w1 eb b1 dac b9 and dp w6 samples from the upper aquifer in the valleys near the outlets are gen w3 cuc b6 cal s1 canf b7 ara w4 vb b5 ore w2 man b4 and negf b16 samples from the lower aquifer are nvp b11 and cam1 b8 and samples from the granites are tri s3 mul b15 for b12 luc b13 and df b17 the rainwater sampling has been achieved using a home made plastic rain gauge as described in gröning et al 2012 and placed at the centre of the plateau near the cam2 b3 sampling point fig 1 measurements of physico chemical parameters and sampling for major ions and for stable isotopes of the water molecule were performed on a monthly basis the monthly rain amount was also measured in the rain gauge whose max capacity is 275 mm considering the volume of the bottle 25 l and the funnel surface 908 cm2 the sampling of unexploited wells and boreholes was performed with a grundfoss mp1 or a comet submersible pump depending on the depth of sampling both with a nylon tube for exploited ones water was sampled directly at the tap avoiding any contamination and any air mixing for sampling points of the upper aquifer water levels have been measured before pumping only 8 sampling points of the upper aquifer guarantee a realistic observation of the water table cpo b10 vb b5 canf b7 eb b1 cam2 b3 df b17 canp w5 and man b4 3 2 2 analytical procedures groundwater electrical conductivity ec and temperature t were measured in the field with a wtw cond 3310 m wtw gmbh weilheim germany bicarbonates were determined in the field using a hach digital titrator hach company loveland usa samples for major ions cl so4 2 no3 na ca2 mg2 and k were filtrated through 0 45 µm nitrocellulose membranes before collection in two 50 ml polyethylene bottles and stored at 4 c one of them was acidified using ultrapure hno3 for cation analysis the ionic concentrations were determined with a dionex ics 1100 chromatograph thermo fischer scientific waltham usa at the hydrogeology department of the university of corsica france the chemical analysis quality was checked by computation of the ionic balance error and rejected if 5 samples for the stable isotopes of the water molecule analysis were collected in 20 ml amber glass bottles without head space the measurements were performed according to the analytical scheme recommended by the international atomic energy agency penna et al 2010 with a liquid water stable isotope analyser dlt 100 los gatos research san jose usa at the hydrogeology department of the university of corsica france the isotopic analysis quality was checked with a standard deviation condition up to 1 for δ2h and up to 0 1 for δ18o 3 2 3 computing procedures in order to distinguish the sea salt ss and the non sea salt nss ionic fractions in rainwater the cl has been assumed as a reference element for sea source see 3 method the sea salt fractions for any major ion are given by ss x cl rain x cl seawater where x cl seawater is the standard ratio of the ion x and cl concentrations from seawater non sea salt fractions for ions x are then computed as nss x x rain x ss where x rain is the concentration of the ion x in rain the enrichment factors ef are also used to identify the sources of ions in precipitation the ef is computed as follows ef x x cl rain x cl seawater if the ef is 1 the enrichment highlights other sources than the marine one if the reverse appears the depletion indicates then a loss of ions celle 2000 the deuterium excess d excess is the enrichment in δ2h exceeding that of δ18o occurring principally during evaporation when precipitation follows the gmwl the d excess value is around 10 but the relative humidity and temperature of air masses from oceanic origin has a major influence on the initial d composition of water vapour merlivat and jouzel 1979 it is computed as follows d excess δ 2 h 8 δ 1 8 o 4 results and discussion 4 1 aquifer recharge rates estimates annual and monthly aquifer recharge rates estimated for the 1980 2014 period are presented in figs 2 and 3 respectively the median annual aquifer recharge rate is about 132 mm fig 2 which corresponds to 26 of the 503 mm of total annual rainfall table 1 from one year to another one the climatic conditions are extremely variable especially the rainfall amount with values from 279 to 888 mm year as a consequence aquifer recharge rate varies highly and the observed values evolve from 19 to 45 of total annual rainfall or from 38 to 403 mm year the aquifer recharge rates display thus an important inter annual variability these observations are very consistent regarding the western mediterranean context as an example with annual rainfall amounts from 240 mm to 1070 mm infiltration rates may be 10 in sardinia and up to 50 in italy or in spain scozzafava and tallini 2001 ghiglieri et al 2014 martos rosillo et al 2015 karst aquifers from italy sicily portugal algarve and spain andalusia display also wide ranges with infiltration rates between 22 and 67 whereas porous and alluvial aquifers from spain majorca ebro delta sardinia or morocco present values between 9 and 26 cimino et al 1998 candela et al 2009 ghiglieri et al 2012 stigter et al 2014 according to the used method the aquifer recharge rates have a considerable inter annual and inter seasonal variability with clear favourable recharge conditions from september to may the monthly aquifer recharge rates are zero during summer june july and august whereas the maximum are observed during fall winter with mean values about 30 mm month for november and december figs 2 and 3 aquifer recharge rates are noticeable during the winter spring period too with values between 10 and 15 mm month for the february may period the absolute values of annual aquifer recharge rates nevertheless vary significantly from a method to another one the guttman method is supposed to give more realistic results for this study because built on observations from carbonate aquifers under semi arid climate guttman 1947 similar to the bonifacio aquifer the median recharge value about 145 mm thus obtained is very consistent with the values calculated from using the swb and the wtf methods otherwise the kessler and sim methods seem to overestimate the recharge rate with median values about 254 and 355 mm respectively the first is more adapted to karstic systems kessler 1965 but remains interesting considering subsurface heterogeneity whereas the latter is rather employed for large scale studies habets et al 2008 the turc and cmb methods seem for their part to under evaluate the recharge rates with median values about 72 and 34 mm respectively the first is limited by considering few parameters precipitation and temperature turc 1954 and the second is impacted by multiple source and processes affecting chloride concentrations from rainfall to groundwater eriksson and khunakasem 1969 in any cases combining all of these methods is the best way to obtain consistent aquifer recharge rate estimations scanlon et al 2006 4 2 rainwater characterisation 4 2 1 rainwater chemistry the electrical conductivity in bonifacio rainwater highly varies in time with values between 21 and 343 µs cm table 2 and is well correlated with na r 0 87 cl r 0 75 ca r 0 72 and hco3 r 0 62 these are also the most abundant elements and represent up to 84 of the total major ions in order to distinguish the sea salt ss and the non sea salt nss ionic fractions in rainwater the cl has been assumed as a reference element for sea source see 3 method all these computations for the monthly bonifacio rainwater are shown in table 3 na and mg show ef values around 1 indicating as for cl a marine source to their concentration in rainwater in opposition hco3 no3 so4 k and ca displays ef values far higher than 1 signifying that the marine source contributes poorly to their concentration in rainwater the non marine source of hco3 and ca about respectively 0 157 and 0 137 meq l is attributed to the local carbonate dusts from the bonifacio plateau and may be also attributed to a long distance transport through the sirocco wind loye pilot et al 1986 a marine source for ca is also evidenced with a ss value about 0 011 meq l furthermore no3 and so4 about respectively 0 016 and 0 018 meq l are attributed mainly to anthropogenic atmospheric pollution bertrand et al 2008 celle jeanton et al 2009 but a marine origin is also highlighted for so4 0 022 meq l the bonifacio rainwaters are consequently under high marine 59 medium terrigenic 37 and low anthropogenic 4 influences the coastal context of the bonifacio plateau is obviously the reason why the marine influence is high but this influence is strongly enhanced by the windy conditions causing heavy swell generating significant sea sprays all over the study area the dry deposits from sea sprays are further solubilized by the rain and then leached through the soil by infiltration waters dazy et al 1997 alcala and custodio 2008 manca et al 2015 4 2 2 local meteoric water line the rainfall stable isotope values in bonifacio for the studied period are between 11 70 δ18o 87 4 δ2h measured in april 2015 and 2 43 δ18o 1 9 δ2h measured in june 2014 and july 2015 respectively the temporal variation of δ2h and δ18o in rainwater depends mainly on climatic factors such as air temperature and humidity wind speed evaporation origin and trajectory of air masses rozanski et al 1982 clark and fritz 1997 celle jeanton et al 2001 in bonifacio the isotope signatures follows naturally a cycle governed by the seasonal climatic variations typically observed in the mediterranean area gat and carmi 1970 the most depleted values are mainly found during the winter and the most enriched during the summer table 2 the weighted means 6 84 for δ18o and about 44 2 for δ2h are in good agreement with the neighbouring data from sardinia sassari 6 58 37 3 in longinelli and selmo 2003 and from corsica ajaccio 6 89 44 0 in huneau et al 2015 due to the rayleigh distillation process controlling the fractionation of δ18o and δ2h dansgaard 1964 gat and carmi 1970 the isotopic content in rainwater usually plot along the global meteoric water line gmwl defined by craig 1961 nevertheless the slope may be site specific depending on the local effect of climate and topography rozanski et al 1982 jaunat et al 2013 huneau et al 2015 the local meteoric water line for the bonifacio precipitation bmwl is defined as δ2h 7 39 δ18o 6 03 r2 0 99 only considering non evaporated samples i e h 10 mm and d 3 fig 4 excluding then the effects of sub cloud evaporation froehlich et al 2008 this relation is consistent with the western mediterranean meteoric water line wmmwl of celle jeanton et al 2001 and with the meteoric water lines of montpellier southern france defined as δ2h 7 4 δ18o 7 3 ladouche et al 2009 or of sicily italy defined as δ2h 6 75 δ18o 8 2 liotta et al 2013 contributions of recycled moisture evaporated from inland sources conduces usually to lower d excess values as observed in the eastern mediterranean due to a mixing of air masses of north atlantic and mediterranean origins gat and carmi 1987 the low d excess of 6 03 in bonifacio highlight the importance of the evaporation processes which may probably be enhanced by strong winds affecting the study site 4 3 runoff and groundwater characterisation geochemical and isotope analyses of runoff and groundwater appear in table 4 mean values among all the samples runoff waters present the highest ph up to 7 8 and the lowest ec 635 µs cm typical of rainwater flowing on carbonates moreover the chloride concentrations in runoff waters 130 145 mg l are slightly lower than groundwater 230 mg l but much higher than rainwater 8 mg l highlighting a soil leaching of evapo concentrated sea salts during surface flow and infiltration appelo and postma 2005 meredith et al 2015 this is also evidenced by the δ18o whose mean values in runoff 6 50 for par r2 6 10 for canr r1 are more enriched than the rainwater weighted mean 6 84 groundwater of the upper aquifer and especially from the recharge areas shows a wide range of physico chemical ionic and isotopic values this may be evidenced through the ec going from 829 to 2409 µs cm the cl concentration from 71 to 452 mg l the hco3 from 324 to 541 mg l the no3 from 0 to 29 mg l and the δ18o from 6 2 to 4 9 the water types from ca hco3 to na so4 and na cl fig 5 reflects also this observation very well groundwater from the granites displays acid to neutral ph 6 0 to 7 4 and highly variable ec with values from 719 to 2345 µs cm as suggested by water types appearing in fig 5 the ec is directly influenced by the na cl and k concentrations the na and cl concentrations depend on the distance from the shores through the sea sprays and seawater intrusion in table 4 k concentrations around 5 mg l are induced by groundwater rock interactions with k feldspar due to granite weathering santoni et al 2016b nevertheless the highest k concentrations are positively correlated with no3 highlighting then a clear anthropogenic vulnerability of recharge waters in some places related to the usage of mineral fertilizers for vegetable patches as shown by intermediate physico chemical ionic and isotopic values groundwater from the lower aquifer consists in a mixing of groundwater from the upper aquifer and from the granitic domain recharge waters displays then highly variable characteristics due to rain and runoff quality variability in time and space which may also be supported by the existence of multiple recharge processes 4 4 recharge processes identification in order to identify the different recharge processes occurring within the aquifer box plots were built to illustrate the geochemical and isotopic variations in groundwater over time and space fig 6 then the data indicates a clear damping of geochemical and isotopic values from the upper aquifer recharge areas or shallow granitic levels to the upper aquifer outlets to the deep granitic level and to the lower aquifer this observation is in very good agreement with the conclusions of santoni et al 2016c showing a low renewal dynamic of the reservoir most groundwater samples are characterized by ec values in the same range than runoff waters implying a common behaviour for these two water bodies that is only possible by focused recharge fig 6a the other samples show ec values higher than runoff sign of other recharge processes occurring for the majority of groundwater samples the nitrate concentrations fig 6b are under the natural baseline nitrate concentration in the absence of nitrogen fertilization of about 5 7 mg l appelo and postma 2005 nevertheless the high values table 3 observed at some sites are attributed to localized agricultural practices sba b14 eb b1 or to individual sewage treatment plants istp such as for cpo b10 note that some groundwater samples from the upper aquifer near the outlet shows also noticeable nitrate concentrations and especially man b4 due to a mixing of old groundwater with a fraction of contaminated recharge water santoni et al 2016c the cl and na ions are considered here as good tracers of recharge waters because no different source from actual seawater is evidenced table 3 then some groundwater samples showing cl concentrations in the same range than runoff waters point to a focused recharge process fig 6c otherwise the sampling point negp w1 being the maximum cl concentration observed without any seawater intrusion because of its inland location the high concentration observed being more related to sea sprays groundwater samples displaying values higher than these for b12 luc b13 are considered to be potentially mixed with a small seawater fraction between these two cases the groundwater samples displaying cl concentration above those of runoff and lower than negp w1 are related to soil leaching of evapo concentrated sea salts during diffuse infiltration cf chapter 4 3 or due to agricultural irrigation return flows and associated evaporation chandrajith et al 2016 yousif et al 2016 the same trend is observed for the δ18o values fig 6d enriched values may reflect irrigation and or seawater intrusion trends moreover the most 18o depleted groundwater samples find their origin within the surrounding fractured granitic hills where recharge water msr recharge process are influenced by altitude effect santoni et al 2016b as a consequence all these observations validate the existence of the four recharge processes described previously diffuse focused msr and irrigation within the bonifacio aquifer 4 5 recharge processes characterisation to characterize the recharge processes a selection of 3 sampling points located in the recharge area fig 6 and representative of different contexts have been compared with climatic parameters input signal and runoff fig 7 1 the sampling point cpo b10 is considered as representative of groundwater recharged in the valleys by a focused way due to its location near the parmentile temporary stream and due to the availability of a representative water table level chronicle 2 the sampling point dp w6 has been selected to be representative of groundwater recharged by a diffuse way and 3 the sampling point eb b1 is considered to be representative of groundwater potentially recharged from irrigation note that previous studies already defined the presence of msr recharge process by highlighting a lateral recharge of the carbonate plateau due to a hydraulic connection with the surrounding fractured granites santoni et al 2016b c as described previously the rainfall scheme displays a strong seasonal evolution with an alternation of dryer periods end of spring to summer fall and wetter periods fall winter to the beginning of spring most of the time the difference between the rainfall amount and the pet is negative which means that the infiltration from rain to the water table is supposed impossible during high rainfall periods the difference between the rainfall amount and the pet is positive allowing then recharge processes to be activated e g jan to mar 2013 nov 2013 to mar 2014 and nov dec 2015 depending on the prevailing recharge processes the water flow transfer will result in variable behaviours of the hydraulic charge and also of geochemical and isotopic tracers 4 5 1 focused recharge the focused recharge is defined as recharge from ephemeral or perennial surface water through concentration of precipitation and runoff processes and resulting infiltration at specific location on the landscape the potentiometric level at the sampling point cpo b10 appears as conditioned by the rainfall scheme with a continuous decrease starting at the end of spring until the next winter min around 70 m a s l before a quick increase few months after the rainiest periods max up to 75 m a s l the same trend is observed with the cl content and with the δ18o values their evolution over time is well correlated with the input signal and runoff indeed there is a seasonal variation of the chloride concentration in runoff and groundwater at cpo b10 with lower values during rainfall periods because of ionic dilution up to 106 mg l in runoff 175 mg l at cpo b10 and higher values during wetter periods up to 176 mg l in runoff 355 mg l at cpo b10 due to ionic concentration process similar variations are observed for δ18o values with more depleted values during rainfall periods up to 6 61 for runoff 6 35 at cpo b10 and more enriched ones during wetter periods due to evaporation processes up to 5 48 in runoff 5 80 at cpo b10 information coming from the evolution of water table chloride and oxygen 18 over time strongly argue in favour of intense runoff groundwater interactions this finding is thus synonym of continuous and quality variable recharge conditions over time typical of focused recharge 4 5 2 diffuse recharge diffuse recharge corresponds to recharge waters from precipitation occurring as a direct infiltration of rain followed by percolation to the water table the chloride concentrations in groundwater samples from dp w6 are fairly stable around 280 mg l this value is relatively high and may be related to sea sprays due to the vicinity of the shore fig 1 when the difference between the rainfall amount and the pet turns positive groundwater from this sampling point displays a quick and intense increase in chloride concentrations with values up to 490 mg l november 2013 and up to 347 mg l december 2014 before a progressive decrease until the base level concentration this observation is typical of soil evapo concentrated sea salt leaching by recharge water appelo and postma 2005 meredith et al 2015 furthermore the behaviour of groundwater δ18o signature over time displays a similar pattern than runoff or focused recharge but with a lower amplitude from 6 10 to 5 66 and with a delay of 2 3 months respectively related to a low recharge of inertial water bodies and to the deep unsaturated zone santoni et al 2016c this finding associated with water ca hco3 to na cl water types highlighting both influences of outcropping calcarenites and rainwater influenced by seawater signature fig 5 table 3 testifies consequently of the presence of diffuse recharge processes 4 5 3 irrigation recharge irrigation recharge is the water from cropping irrigation that reach the water table and may be derived from surface and groundwater the potentiometric level at the sampling point eb b1 is highly variable from 29 8 to 49 3 m a s l and is characterized by a succession of seasonal peaks as expected some of them are observed during the rainiest periods when the natural recharge processes are activated higher levels are additionally observed from the end of spring to the end of summer even if the difference between the rain amount and the pet is negative e g may june 2013 june july 2014 all these peaks are associated higher concentrations in nitrate from 20 up to 39 mg l and chloride from 270 up to 402 mg l as well as higher δ18o values from 5 79 to 5 53 especially for the may june 2013 period such solute contents and isotopes ratios enrichments may be due to agricultural irrigation return flows and associated evaporation chandrajith et al 2016 this finding consequently argue in favour of a recharge induced by irrigation 4 5 4 lateral recharge msr the msr is the recharge provided by streams loss at mountain fronts and resulting sub surface transfer of groundwater from the mountain block to the adjacent aquifer the lateral recharge process of the bonifacio aquifer has been described in previous studies 1 dissolved anthropogenic atmospheric gases cfcs and sf6 were used to evaluate groundwater residence time and flow pattern santoni et al 2016c natural sf6 from pegmatite veins of the surrounding fractured granites found within the carbonate aquifer has been used as a direct tracer of groundwater origin highlighting a lateral recharge especially for cam1 b8 nvp b11 and sba b14 2 an approach coupling the δ18o and the 87sr 86sr allowed to compute and validate the mixing rates between the granites the lower and the upper aquifer santoni et al 2016b the recharge provided by the neighbouring fractured granites represents up to 24 of the total recharge this additional natural recharge rises consequently the recharge area of the aquifer of 32 in surface which is now extended to the whole topographic catchment boundaries 4 6 identifying the main processes conditioning recharge the δ18o vs δ2h graph fig 8 a is here employed as a tool to deduce groundwater origins all 511 groundwater samples are plotted on the global the western mediterranean and the bonifacio meteoric water lines this means that groundwater is actively recharged by modern local precipitation the groundwater isotopic signatures from 28 to 42 and from 6 9 to 4 6 are significantly different from the signature of seawater with values of about 6 9 and 1 22 for δ2h and δ18o respectively consequently no noticeable seawater intrusion is appearing except locally and punctually as for dac b9 nevertheless there is a difference between the groundwater isotopes mean values of 36 3 for δ2h and 6 09 for δ18o and the rainwater weighted mean values of 44 2 for δ2h and 6 84 for δ18o usually in such an aquifer the groundwater isotope value is similar to the weighted mean of the annual rainwater isotopic signature but the slight isotopic enrichment of groundwater observed here accurately coincides with the runoff mean of 36 6 for δ2h and 6 06 for δ18o fig 8b nevertheless the d excess being most of the time around 11 13 in all groundwater samples evaporation is not the main process occurring during runoff the enrichment seems then rather related to a rapid infiltration of rainwater occurring also during winter spring with less negative isotopic values than fall winter rainwater table 2 rapid infiltration of runoff waters is realistic taking into account the heterogeneity of the study site described in the study area section this is also well supported by the median annual aquifer recharge rate about 26 of the 508 mm of total annual rainfall described previously fig 2 this value is indeed relatively high compared to similar carbonate coastal aquifers in the western mediterranean whose recharge rate is generally from 9 to 18 ghiglieri et al 2014 stigter et al 2014 all these conclusions argue strongly in favour of a predominant focused recharge process within the bonifacio aquifer on which are superimposed diffuse msr and irrigation processes 4 7 focused recharge and water resource availability recently evidence of the dependence of groundwater resources on extreme rainfall were made in east africa taylor et al 2013b their groundwater isotope signatures were different from a weighted mean of rainwater due to el nino southern oscillation and indian ocean dipole mode disproportional contribution to recharge highlighting then the role of extreme rain events favouring aquifer recharge since high rainfall events are predicted to be more and more frequent in the mediterranean scanlon et al 2006 this change in rainfall scheme should have consequences on the aquifers recharge conditions it appears necessary to evaluate if the mediterranean climatic trends are verified at the local scale in the present study in this aim the number of daily rainfall events per decade for the 1960 2009 period provided by météo france are presented in fig 9 for the southern corsica area for rainfall events up to 60 mm day no noticeable variation is visible in contrast a clear increase in the 80 200 mm day events appears for the last two decades as an example the number of daily rainfall amounts about 100 mm increase from 17 to 23 for the 1960 1989 period to 30 31 for the 1990 2009 period this is the same for rainfall amounts about 140 mm with an increase from 4 to 6 for the 1960 1989 period to 13 16 for the 1990 2009 period the global climatic trends implying an increase in high rainfall events are thereby verified at the local scale of the bonifacio aquifer a very good linear correlation is observable between the annual rainfall amounts and the corresponding recharge rates with an r2 about 0 92 this observation implies that more intense rain events means more favourable recharge conditions this is well illustrated by the highest recharge rates observed recently 1996 2004 2008 2010 and 2013 with values between 40 and 45 324 403 mm of the annual rainfall amount fig 2 table 1 the authors are aware that by using the espere code the recharge rate should increase with increased precipitation but this observation is still realistic since a focused recharge process prevails within the bonifacio aquifer indeed focused recharge is known to favour aquifer recharge rates in regions with heterogeneous subsurface characteristics because water is rapidly passed downward de vries and simmers 2002 scanlon et al 2002 meixner et al 2016 hartmann et al 2017 the present findings indicate that the climate change seems to enhance groundwater availability of such heterogeneous mediterranean coastal aquifers as suggested by the projections of hartmann et al 2017 5 conclusions the findings of this study clearly demonstrate that the sensitivity of groundwater renewal of mediterranean coastal aquifers is dependent on the prevailing recharge process for the first time a monthly two years monitoring approach combining major ions and stable isotopes of water in rain runoff and ground waters allowed to observe and characterize four recharge processes within a heterogeneous coastal aquifer in the mediterranean area the groundwater isotopic signatures clearly demonstrate the domination of the focused recharge process on which are superimposed diffuse msr and irrigation processes the very good correlation between the rainfall amount and the recharge rate in bonifacio implies actually that more intense rain events consequently means more favourable recharge conditions rapid infiltration of runoff waters is most likely caused by the surface heterogeneity of the study site high rainfall events being predicted to be more frequent in the future focused recharge constitutes thus an important process favouring aquifers recharge in mediterranean regions with heterogeneous subsurface characteristics the findings of the present paper are strategic because coastal aquifers are the most vulnerable hydrosystems to climate change since they are exposed to seawater intrusion which can get worse due to low recharge conditions sea level rise and over pumping risks better constrained aquifer recharge rates and recharge processes contribute to guarantee the water resources sustainability and availability especially when recharge conditions are not favourable and highly variable such as under semi arid or mediterranean climate likely water management strategies including adapted water management plans have to take into account the variable flow dynamics of such aquifers with heterogeneous recharge behaviour groundwater pumping rates could be then adapted to the temporally variable water availability this issue is especially acute in the mediterranean region where the expected high inter annual variability of recharge will require adapted measures for water resources protection and management to use the potential additional recharge evidenced in this study acknowledgement the ph d grant of sébastien santoni was financially supported by the regional council of corsica collectivité territoriale de corse the authors would like to thank the municipality of bonifacio for their support and contribution to the implementation of the project the authors would also like to thank the bonifacio inhabitants for access to their wells and boreholes during the field sampling the authors are grateful to m patrick rebillout from météo france ajaccio for providing the weather data 
7412,climate change is nowadays widely considered to have major effects on groundwater resources climatic projections suggest a global increase in evaporation and higher frequency of strong rainfall events especially in mediterranean context since evaporation is synonym of low recharge conditions whereas strong rainfall events are more favourable to recharge in heterogeneous subsurface contexts a lack of knowledge remains then on the real ongoing and future drinking groundwater supply availability at aquifers scale due to low recharge potential and high inter annual climate variability this issue is strategic for the mediterranean hydrosystems this is especially the case for coastal aquifers because they are exposed to seawater intrusion sea level rise and overpumping risks in this context recharge processes and rates were investigated in a mediterranean coastal aquifer with subsurface heterogeneity located in southern corsica france aquifer recharge rates from combining ten physical and chemical methods were computed in addition hydrochemical and isotopic investigations were carried out through a monthly two years monitoring combining major ions and stable isotopes of water in rain runoff and groundwater diffuse focused lateral mountain system and irrigation recharge processes were identified and characterized a predominant focused recharge conditioned by subsurface heterogeneity is evidenced in agreement with variable but highly favourable recharge rates the fast water transfer from the surface to the aquifer implied by this recharge process suggests less evaporation which means higher groundwater renewal and availability in such mediterranean coastal aquifers keywords aquifer recharge rainfall hydrochemistry stable isotopes water management 1 introduction groundwaters represent up to 33 of total water withdrawals around the world and are already widely overexploited gleeson et al 2012 famiglietti 2014 climate spatial temporal variability and change influences groundwater systems directly through renewal by recharge and indirectly by changes in groundwater use taylor et al 2013a the renewal of groundwater occurs from many recharge processes which are strongly dependant on climate land cover and geology richts et al 2011 jaunat et al 2016 climate and land cover govern precipitation and evapotranspiration whereas geology determines water transmission through the soil and storage from the surface and subsurface to aquifers between the global scale and the basin site specific studies connecting groundwater recharge and climatic projections a lack of knowledge remains concerning the understanding of specific recharge processes within a given region since studies of recharge often display different types of recharge meixner et al 2016 defined four main recharge processes to ease comparative analysis in the western united states thus they distinguish diffuse focused mountain system recharge msr and irrigation recharge coupling climate projections with detailed recharge process based models may thus contribute to reduce aquifer recharge rate estimates uncertainty in predicting aquifer recharge scenarios recently hartmann et al 2017 showed that regions with developed subsurface heterogeneity enhance recharge rates due to a different sensitivity facing climate change compared to more homogeneous regions according to hartmann et al 2017 the concept of heterogeneity refers to hydraulic conductivities storage capacities and porosities the ensuing findings indicate that the water balance of mediterranean and desert heterogeneous areas will be less dominated by evapotranspiration than regions with homogeneous subsurface because water is rapidly passed downward to guarantee water resources sustainability constraining aquifer recharge rates and recharge processes is consequently strategic especially when recharge conditions are low such as under semi arid or mediterranean climate this is especially the case for coastal aquifers which are highly vulnerable to climate change because exposed to seawater intrusion linked to low recharge conditions sea level rise and overpumping risks lee et al 2006 dhar and datta 2009 javadi et al 2015 as a part of the western mediterranean area considered as a climate change hotspot pachauri et al 2014 the corsica island france is a strategic place to constrain recharge processes and associated amounts under high climatic pressure located at the south of the island the bonifacio coastal aquifer has been selected for such a study because the geology and the hydrogeology are well documented and evidenced a noticeable subsurface heterogeneity mcdonnell et al 2007 orsini et al 2010 reynaud et al 2012 santoni et al 2016a b c in addition since a msr and a diffuse recharge have been described in santoni et al 2016b and considering the presence of multiple irrigated vegetable patches all the 4 recharge processes described previously are suspected to occur at the same time even if the study site is little extended insofar as no seawater intrusion is yet detected in the bonifacio aquifer santoni et al 2016a major ions and stable isotopes of the water molecule seemed very suitable to study the recharge because they are able to give insight into the source and timing of recharge de vries and simmers 2002 scanlon et al 2002 fernandez chacon et al 2010 florea 2013 a monthly two years monitoring approach combining major ions and stable isotopes of water in rain runoff and groundwater was carried out from february 2013 to march 2015 to try to study as accurate as possible the recharge processes aquifer recharge rate estimation are presented from 10 physical and chemical methods for the last three decades before a description of the chemistry and the isotope content in rain runoff and groundwaters then the recharge processes from hydrochemistry and isotope tools are identified characterized and prioritized finally the climatic and recharge rates trends are discussed regarding the recharge processes evidenced to infer trends on the ongoing and future water resource availability of mediterranean coastal aquifers 2 study area 2 1 location and climate the bonifacio plateau is located in the southern part of the corsica island fig 1 the region is under a typical mediterranean climate characterized by highly heterogeneous temperature and rain conditions from one year to another one lionello et al 2006 bolle 2012 it is also classified by the köppen geiger criteria peel et al 2007 as a so called csa climate temperate climate with a dry summer the mean annual temperature and precipitation at the bonifacio météo france station capo pertusato fig 1 are 16 8 c and 605 mm respectively calculated from 01 2000 to 01 2012 the sector of bonifacio is also known for its wind blowing up to 300 days per year often with gusts above 60 80 km h causing heavy swell and generating significant sea sprays all over the region the study site is bounded in equal proportions by granites at the east and the west and by the tyrrhenian sea at the northeast and the mediterranean sea at the south fig 1 its triangular shape extends over an area of 25 km2 with a mean elevation of 80 m asl the miocene carbonate deposits fill a granitic depression up to 270 m deep and are in contact with granitic relief of an altitude up to 243 m at the monte corbu west side and 113 m at the punta di san mulari east side the bonifacio plateau is cut by four east west oriented valleys st jean st julien canettu and canali the canali river is the only permanent river with very low flow during summer and takes its source on the granitic massifs before crossing the plateau in direction of the sant amanza bay many streams may appear temporary within the four valleys and also in contact with the granites massifs during high rainfall events this is especially the case for paraguano and parmentile temporary streams located at the north west interface of the plateau with the granites fig 1 the 3000 inhabitants of bonifacio reside mainly around the harbour and along the saint julien and saint jean valleys various villas and campgrounds are spread over the plateau some scarce agricultural activities like market gardening and cattle breeding are found at the centre of the plateau the rest of the area being covered by abandoned agricultural land and mediterranean maquis 2 2 geology the bonifacio aquifer is developed in a sedimentary miocene basin and lies on a granitic depression fig 1 from the base to the top the bonifacio sedimentary basin is composed of the balistra calcareous gravelly sands the cala di labra shelly litharenites and the bonifacio calcareous fine grained sandy litharenite formations ferrandini 2003 orsini et al 2010 reynaud et al 2012 the fraction of calcite also increases to the top of the series as the fraction of weathering products from the surrounding granites decreases a sandy silt level within the cala di labra formation materializes the separation between the upper and the lower aquifer the granitic bedrock and the sedimentary sequences as a cross section are described in more extended details in santoni et al 2016b the lithology and the structure of the basin suggests clearly a well developed heterogeneity with respect to porosities and water storage capacities the granitic bedrock and the bonifacio basin displays also high heterogeneity due to their intense fracturation fractures north south and northeast southwest oriented affects principally the granites whereas fractures east west oriented affects both the bedrock and the sedimentary basin dörfliger et al 2002 gattacceca et al 2007 oudet et al 2010 reynaud et al 2012 2 3 hydrogeology background the coastal aquifer hosted by the carbonated sediments represents the only available local groundwater resource in southern corsica this region faces also an important touristic activity in summer and additional surface water resources coming from dams located further north are then necessary the bonifacio aquifer is composed of two main aquifer levels separated by the silty layer of the cala di labra formation the thick unsaturated zone up to 50 m in the centre of the plateau is a major characteristic of the aquifer environmental tracers allowed assessing mineralization processes and three groundwater types are observed 1 a ca hco3 water type in the upper aquifer conditioned by carbonate dissolution 2 a na cl water type in the granites due to sea sprays favoured by the winds and 3 an intermediate ca na cl water type in the lower aquifer conditioned by the mixing of groundwater from the upper aquifer and granites santoni et al 2016a some groundwater samples show noticeable nitrate concentrations up to 40 mg l highlighting the vulnerability of the aquifer regarding human activities such as irrigation of gardens and individual sewage treatment plants istp groundwater residence time estimations shows weighted ages from 0 to 50 a in the upper aquifer and from 35 to 60 a in the lower aquifer indicating a relatively low dynamic of renewal santoni et al 2016c two flow patterns are identified 1 an autochthonous vertical recharge of the upper aquifer with an aging from the centre of the plateau to the shores bonifacio harbour and sant amanza is observed and consistent with the potentiometric heads and 2 an allochthonous lateral recharge of the lower aquifer via the surrounding fractured granites santoni et al 2016c hydraulic conductivities range from 1 4 to 2 2 10 6 m s in the upper aquifer and from 2 1 to 4 9 10 6 m s in the lower aquifer dörfliger et al 2002 santoni et al 2016c highlighting the heterogeneity of the aquifer also with respect to hydraulic conductivities an approach using 87sr 86sr allowed to validate and compute the mixing rates between the granites the upper and the lower aquifer two outlets are possible for groundwater 1 anthropogenic around 180 000 m3 year of groundwater are taken for drinking water supply needs and 2 natural through the submarine groundwater discharge santoni et al 2016b in situ 224 223ra and 222rn measurements along the coastline display low activities thus reflecting low discharge conditions the main discharge points were found in the bonifacio harbour and in sant amanza bay fig 1 in agreement with low temperatures observed using thermal infrared images garel et al 2015 3 method 3 1 aquifer recharge rates estimation the existing methods in the literature to estimate aquifer recharge rates vary in terms of nature and scale and includes physical chemical isotopic and modelling techniques lerner et al 1990 hendrickx and walker 1997 zhang and walker 1998 kinzelbach et al 2002 scanlon et al 2002 to achieve realistic estimation and confidence interval it is strategic to use as much as possible long datasets chronicles and to consider different approaches that complement and support each other scanlon et al 2006 in this way we computed the aquifer recharge rates from using the espere v1 5 multiple method excel sheet application lanini et al 2016 which allows aquifer recharge rates and aquifer recharge estimations from using several common methods we applied the empirical methods of guttman 1947 turc 1954 and kessler 1965 the soil water balance methods swb proposed by thornthwaite 1948 improved by dingman 2002 and the water table fluctuation wtf method proposed by delin et al 2007 for the implementation of the espere v1 5 excel sheet we used the daily temperature c daily rainfall amount mm and daily potential evapotranspiration pet mm provided by the météo france weather station of bonifacio pertusato ref 20041001 for the 01 1980

chloride mass balance cmb method was computed for the 01 2013 12 2014 period according to eriksson and khunakasem 1969 the mean annual rainfall amount was provided by the météo france station of bonifacio and the monthly chloride concentrations in rainwater and groundwater from the rain gauge and the borehole at cam2 b3 recharge area the safran isba modcou sim hydrometeorological model is provided by météo france and consists of a combination of a meteorological analysis system safran a land surface model isba and a hydrogeological model modcou habets et al 2008 values for the bonifacio station were extracted from the météo france data base for the 01 2013 12 2014 period 3 2 hydrochemistry and isotope composition of waters 3 2 1 sampling network rain runoff and groundwater

near the cam2 b3 sampling point fig 1 measurements of physico chemical parameters and sampling for major ions and for stable isotopes of the water molecule were performed on a monthly basis the monthly rain amount was also measured in the rain gauge whose max capacity is 275 mm considering the volume of the bottle 25 l and the funnel surface 908 cm2 the sampling of unexploited wells and boreholes was performed with a grundfoss mp1 or a comet submersible pump depending on the depth of sampling both with a nylon tube for exploited ones water was sampled directly at the tap avoiding any contamination and any air mixing for sampling points of the upper aquifer water levels have been measured before pumping only 8 sampling points of the upper aquifer guarantee a realistic observation

gatos research san jose usa at the hydrogeology department of the university of corsica france the isotopic analysis quality was checked with a standard deviation condition up to 1 for δ2h and up to 0 1 for δ18o 3 2 3 computing procedures in order to distinguish the sea salt ss and the non sea salt nss ionic fractions in rainwater the cl has been assumed as a reference element for sea source see 3 method the sea salt fractions for any major ion are given by ss x cl rain x cl seawater where x cl seawater is the standard ratio of the ion x and cl concentrations from seawater non sea salt fractions for ions x are then computed as nss x x rain x ss where x rain is the concentration of the ion x in rain the enrichment factors ef are also used to identify the sources of ions in precipitation the ef is computed as follows ef x x cl rain x cl seawater if the ef is 1 the enrichment highlights other sources than the marine one if the reverse appears the depletion indicates then a loss of ions celle 2000 the deuterium excess d excess is the enrichment in δ2h exceeding that of δ18o occurring principally during evaporation when precipitation follows the gmwl the d excess value

follows d excess δ 2 h 8 δ 1 8 o 4 results and discussion 4 1 aquifer recharge rates estimates annual and monthly aquifer recharge rates estimated for the 1980 2014 period are presented in figs 2 and 3 respectively the median annual aquifer recharge rate is about 132 mm fig 2 which corresponds to 26 of the 503 mm of total annual rainfall table 1 from one year to another one the climatic conditions are extremely variable especially the rainfall amount with values from 279 to 888 mm year as a consequence aquifer recharge rate varies highly and the observed values evolve from 19 to 45 of total annual rainfall or from 38 to 403 mm year the aquifer recharge rates display thus an important inter annual variability these observations are very consistent regarding the western mediterranean context as an example with annual rainfall amounts from 240 mm to 1070 mm infiltration rates may be 10 in sardinia and up to 50 in italy or in spain scozzafava and tallini 2001 ghiglieri et al 2014 martos rosillo et al 2015 karst aquifers from italy sicily portugal algarve and spain andalusia display also wide ranges with infiltration rates between 22 and 67 whereas porous and alluvial aquifers from spain majorca ebro delta sardinia or morocco present values between 9 and 26 cimino et al 1998 candela et al 2009 ghiglieri et al 2012 stigter et al 2014 according to the used method the aquifer recharge rates have a considerable inter annual and inter seasonal variability with clear favourable recharge conditions from september to may the monthly aquifer recharge rates are zero during summer june july and august whereas the maximum are observed during fall winter with mean values about 30 mm month for november and december figs 2 and 3 aquifer recharge rates are noticeable during the winter spring period too with values between 10 and 15 mm month for the february may period the absolute values of annual aquifer recharge rates nevertheless vary significantly from a method to another one the guttman method is supposed to give more realistic results for this study because built on observations from carbonate aquifers under semi arid climate guttman 1947 similar to the bonifacio aquifer the median recharge value about 145 mm thus obtained is very consistent with the values calculated from using the swb and the wtf methods otherwise the kessler and sim methods seem to overestimate the recharge rate with median values about 254 and 355 mm respectively the first is more adapted to karstic systems kessler 1965 but remains interesting considering subsurface heterogeneity whereas the latter is rather employed for large scale studies habets et al 2008 the turc and cmb methods seem for their part to under evaluate the recharge rates with median values about 72 and 34 mm respectively the first is limited by considering few parameters precipitation and temperature turc 1954 and the second is impacted by multiple source and processes affecting chloride concentrations from rainfall to groundwater eriksson and khunakasem 1969 in any cases combining all of these methods is the best way to obtain consistent aquifer recharge rate estimations scanlon et al 2006 4 2 rainwater characterisation 4 2 1 rainwater chemistry the electrical conductivity in bonifacio rainwater highly varies in time with values between 21 and 343 µs cm table 2 and is well correlated with na r 0 87 cl r 0 75 ca r 0 72 and hco3 r 0 62 these are also the most abundant elements and represent up to 84 of the total major ions in order to distinguish the sea salt ss and the non sea salt nss ionic fractions in rainwater the cl has been assumed as a reference element for sea source see 3 method all these computations for the monthly bonifacio rainwater are shown in table 3 na and mg show ef values around 1 indicating as for cl a marine source to their concentration in rainwater in opposition hco3 no3 so4 k and ca displays ef values far higher than 1 signifying that the marine source contributes poorly to their concentration in rainwater the non marine source of hco3 and ca about respectively 0 157 and 0 137 meq l is attributed to the local carbonate dusts from the bonifacio plateau and may be also attributed to a long distance transport through the sirocco wind loye pilot et al 1986 a marine source for ca is also evidenced with a ss value about 0 011 meq l furthermore no3 and so4 about respectively 0 016 and 0 018 meq l are attributed mainly to anthropogenic atmospheric pollution bertrand et al 2008 celle jeanton et al 2009 but a marine origin is also highlighted for so4 0 022 meq l the bonifacio rainwaters are consequently under high marine 59 medium terrigenic 37 and low anthropogenic 4 influences the coastal context of the bonifacio plateau is obviously the reason why the marine influence is high but this influence is strongly enhanced by the windy conditions causing heavy swell generating significant sea sprays all over the study area the dry deposits from sea sprays are further solubilized by the rain and then leached through the soil by infiltration waters dazy et al 1997 alcala and custodio 2008 manca et al 2015 4 2 2 local meteoric water line the rainfall stable isotope values in bonifacio for the studied period are between 11 70 δ18o 87 4 δ2h measured in april 2015 and 2 43 δ18o 1 9 δ2h measured in june 2014 and july 2015 respectively the temporal variation of δ2h and δ18o in rainwater depends mainly on climatic factors such as air temperature and humidity wind speed evaporation origin and trajectory of air masses rozanski et al 1982 clark and fritz 1997 celle jeanton et al 2001 in bonifacio the isotope signatures follows naturally a cycle governed by the seasonal climatic variations typically observed in the mediterranean area gat and carmi 1970 the most depleted values are mainly found during the winter and the most enriched during the summer table 2 the weighted means 6 84 for δ18o and about 44 2 for δ2h are in good agreement with the neighbouring data from sardinia sassari 6 58 37 3 in longinelli and selmo 2003 and from corsica ajaccio 6 89 44 0 in huneau et al 2015 due to the rayleigh distillation process controlling the fractionation of δ18o and δ2h dansgaard 1964 gat and carmi 1970 the isotopic content in rainwater usually plot along the global meteoric water line gmwl defined by craig 1961 nevertheless the slope may be site specific depending on the local effect of climate and topography rozanski et al 1982 jaunat et al 2013 huneau et al 2015 the local meteoric water line for the bonifacio precipitation bmwl is defined as δ2h 7 39 δ18o 6 03 r2 0 99 only considering non evaporated samples i e h 10 mm and d 3 fig 4 excluding then the effects of sub cloud evaporation froehlich et al 2008 this relation is consistent with the western mediterranean meteoric water line wmmwl of celle jeanton et al 2001 and with the meteoric water lines of montpellier southern france defined as δ2h 7 4 δ18o 7 3 ladouche et al 2009 or of sicily italy defined as δ2h 6 75 δ18o 8 2 liotta et al 2013 contributions of recycled moisture evaporated from inland sources conduces usually to lower d excess values as observed in the eastern mediterranean due to a mixing of air masses of north atlantic and mediterranean origins gat and carmi 1987 the low d excess of 6 03 in bonifacio highlight the importance of the evaporation processes which may probably be enhanced by strong winds affecting the study site 4 3 runoff and groundwater characterisation geochemical and isotope analyses of runoff and groundwater appear in table 4 mean values among all the samples runoff waters present the highest ph up to 7 8 and the lowest ec 635 µs cm typical of rainwater flowing on carbonates moreover the chloride concentrations in runoff waters 130 145 mg l are slightly lower than groundwater 230 mg l but much higher than rainwater 8 mg l highlighting a soil leaching of evapo concentrated sea salts during surface flow and infiltration appelo and postma 2005 meredith et al 2015 this is also evidenced by the δ18o whose mean values in runoff 6 50 for par r2 6 10 for canr r1 are more enriched than the rainwater weighted mean 6 84 groundwater of the upper aquifer and especially from the recharge areas shows a wide range of physico chemical ionic and isotopic values this may be evidenced through the ec going from 829 to 2409 µs cm the cl concentration from 71 to 452 mg l the hco3 from 324 to 541 mg l the no3 from 0 to 29 mg l and the δ18o from 6 2 to 4 9 the water types from ca hco3 to na so4 and na cl fig 5 reflects also this observation very well groundwater from the granites displays acid to neutral ph 6 0 to 7 4 and highly variable ec with values from 719 to 2345 µs cm as suggested by water types appearing in fig 5 the ec is directly influenced by the na cl and k concentrations the na and cl concentrations depend on the distance from the shores through the sea sprays and seawater intrusion in table 4 k concentrations around 5 mg l are induced by groundwater rock interactions with k feldspar due to granite weathering santoni et al 2016b nevertheless the highest k concentrations are positively correlated with no3 highlighting then a clear anthropogenic vulnerability of recharge waters in some places related to the usage of mineral fertilizers for vegetable patches as shown by intermediate physico chemical ionic and isotopic values groundwater from the lower aquifer consists in a mixing of groundwater from the upper aquifer and from the granitic domain recharge waters displays then highly variable characteristics due to rain and runoff quality variability in time and space which may also be supported by the existence of multiple recharge processes 4 4 recharge processes identification in order to identify the different recharge processes occurring within the aquifer box plots were built to illustrate the geochemical and isotopic variations in groundwater over time and space fig 6 then the data indicates a clear damping of geochemical and isotopic values from the upper aquifer recharge areas or shallow granitic levels to the upper aquifer outlets to the deep granitic level and to the lower aquifer this observation is in very good agreement with the conclusions of santoni et al 2016c showing a low renewal dynamic of the reservoir most groundwater samples are characterized by ec values in the same range than runoff waters implying a common behaviour for these two water bodies that is only possible by focused recharge fig 6a the other samples show ec values higher than runoff sign of other recharge processes occurring for the majority of groundwater samples the nitrate concentrations fig 6b are under the natural baseline nitrate concentration in the absence of nitrogen fertilization of about 5 7 mg l appelo and postma 2005 nevertheless the high values table 3 observed at some sites are attributed to localized agricultural practices sba b14 eb b1 or to individual sewage treatment plants istp such as for cpo b10 note that some groundwater samples from the upper aquifer near the outlet shows also noticeable nitrate concentrations and especially man b4 due to a mixing of old groundwater with a fraction of contaminated recharge water santoni et al 2016c the cl and na ions are considered here as good tracers of recharge waters because no different source from actual seawater is evidenced table 3 then some groundwater samples showing cl concentrations in the same range than runoff waters point to a focused recharge process fig 6c otherwise the sampling point negp w1 being the maximum cl concentration observed without any seawater intrusion because of its inland location the high concentration observed being more related to sea sprays groundwater samples displaying values higher than these for b12 luc b13 are considered to be potentially mixed with a small seawater fraction between these two cases the groundwater samples displaying cl concentration above those of runoff and lower than negp w1 are related to soil leaching of evapo concentrated sea salts during diffuse infiltration cf chapter 4 3 or due to agricultural irrigation return flows and associated evaporation chandrajith et al 2016 yousif et al 2016 the same trend is observed for the δ18o values fig 6d enriched values may reflect irrigation and or seawater intrusion trends moreover the most 18o depleted groundwater samples find their origin within the surrounding fractured granitic hills where recharge water msr recharge process are influenced by altitude effect santoni et al 2016b as a consequence all these observations validate the existence of the four recharge processes described previously diffuse focused msr and irrigation within the bonifacio aquifer 4 5 recharge processes characterisation to characterize the recharge processes a selection of 3 sampling points located in the recharge area fig 6 and representative of different contexts have been compared with climatic parameters input signal and runoff fig 7 1 the sampling point cpo b10 is considered as representative of groundwater recharged in the valleys by a focused way due to its location near the parmentile temporary stream and due to the availability of a representative water table level chronicle 2 the sampling point dp w6 has been selected to be representative of groundwater recharged by a diffuse way and 3 the sampling point eb b1 is considered to be representative of groundwater potentially recharged from irrigation note that previous studies already defined the presence of msr recharge process by highlighting a lateral recharge of the carbonate plateau due to a hydraulic connection with the surrounding fractured granites santoni et al 2016b c as described previously the rainfall scheme displays a strong seasonal evolution with an alternation of dryer periods end of spring to summer fall and wetter periods fall winter to the beginning of spring most of the time the difference between the rainfall amount and the pet is negative which means that the infiltration from rain to the water table is supposed impossible during high rainfall periods the difference between the rainfall amount and the pet is positive allowing then recharge processes to be activated e g jan to mar 2013 nov 2013 to mar 2014 and nov dec 2015 depending on the prevailing recharge processes the water flow transfer will result in variable behaviours of the hydraulic charge and also of geochemical and isotopic tracers 4 5 1 focused recharge the focused recharge is defined as recharge from ephemeral or perennial surface water through concentration of precipitation and runoff processes and resulting infiltration at specific location on the landscape the potentiometric level at the sampling point cpo b10 appears as conditioned by the rainfall scheme with a continuous decrease starting at the end of spring until the next winter min around 70 m a s l before a quick increase few months after the rainiest periods max up to 75 m a s l the same trend is observed with the cl content and with the δ18o values their evolution over time is well correlated with the input signal and runoff indeed there is a seasonal variation of the chloride concentration in runoff and groundwater at cpo b10 with lower values during rainfall periods because of ionic dilution up to 106 mg l in runoff 175 mg l at cpo b10 and higher values during wetter periods up to 176 mg l in runoff 355 mg l at cpo b10 due to ionic concentration process similar variations are observed for δ18o values with more depleted values during rainfall periods up to 6 61 for runoff 6 35 at cpo b10 and more enriched ones during wetter periods due to evaporation processes up to 5 48 in runoff 5 80 at cpo b10 information coming from the evolution of water table chloride and oxygen 18 over time strongly argue in favour of intense runoff groundwater interactions this finding is thus synonym of continuous and quality variable recharge conditions over time typical of focused recharge 4 5 2 diffuse recharge diffuse recharge corresponds to recharge waters from precipitation occurring as a direct infiltration of rain followed by percolation to the water table the chloride concentrations in groundwater samples from dp w6 are fairly stable around 280 mg l this value is relatively high and may be related to sea sprays due to the vicinity of the shore fig 1 when the difference between the rainfall amount and the pet turns positive groundwater from this sampling point displays a quick and intense increase in chloride concentrations with values up to 490 mg l november 2013 and up to 347 mg l december 2014 before a progressive decrease until the base level concentration this observation is typical of soil evapo concentrated sea salt leaching by recharge water appelo and postma 2005 meredith et al 2015 furthermore the behaviour of groundwater δ18o signature over time displays a similar pattern than runoff or focused recharge but with a lower amplitude from 6 10 to 5 66 and with a delay of 2 3 months respectively related to a low recharge of inertial water bodies and to the deep unsaturated zone santoni et al 2016c this finding associated with water ca hco3 to na cl water types highlighting both influences of outcropping calcarenites and rainwater influenced by seawater signature fig 5 table 3 testifies consequently of the presence of diffuse recharge processes 4 5 3 irrigation recharge irrigation recharge is the water from cropping irrigation that reach the water table and may be derived from surface and groundwater the potentiometric level at the sampling point eb b1 is highly variable from 29 8 to 49 3 m a s l and is characterized by a succession of seasonal peaks as expected some of them are observed during the rainiest periods when the natural recharge processes are activated higher levels are additionally observed from the end of spring to the end of summer even if the difference between the rain amount and the pet is negative e g may june 2013 june july 2014 all these peaks are associated higher concentrations in nitrate from 20 up to 39 mg l and chloride from 270 up to 402 mg l as well as higher δ18o values from 5 79 to 5 53 especially for the may june 2013 period such solute contents and isotopes ratios enrichments may be due to agricultural irrigation return flows and associated evaporation chandrajith et al 2016 this finding consequently argue in favour of a recharge induced by irrigation 4 5 4 lateral recharge msr the msr is the recharge provided by streams loss at mountain fronts and resulting sub surface transfer of groundwater from the mountain block to the adjacent aquifer the lateral recharge process of the bonifacio aquifer has been described in previous studies 1 dissolved anthropogenic atmospheric gases cfcs and sf6 were used to evaluate groundwater residence time and flow pattern santoni et al 2016c natural sf6 from pegmatite veins of the surrounding fractured granites found within the carbonate aquifer has been used as a direct tracer of groundwater origin highlighting a lateral recharge especially for cam1 b8 nvp b11 and sba b14 2 an approach coupling the δ18o and the 87sr 86sr allowed to compute and validate the mixing rates between the granites the lower and the upper aquifer santoni et al 2016b the recharge provided by the neighbouring fractured granites represents up to 24 of the total recharge this additional natural recharge rises consequently the recharge area of the aquifer of 32 in surface which is now extended to the whole topographic catchment boundaries 4 6 identifying the main processes conditioning recharge the δ18o vs δ2h graph fig 8 a is here employed as a tool to deduce groundwater origins all 511 groundwater samples are plotted on the global the western mediterranean and the bonifacio meteoric water lines this means that groundwater is actively recharged by modern local precipitation the groundwater isotopic signatures from 28 to 42 and from 6 9 to 4 6 are significantly different from the signature of seawater with values of about 6 9 and 1 22 for δ2h and δ18o respectively consequently no noticeable seawater intrusion is appearing except locally and punctually as for dac b9 nevertheless there is a difference between the groundwater isotopes mean values of 36 3 for δ2h and 6 09 for δ18o and the rainwater weighted mean values of 44 2 for δ2h and 6 84 for δ18o usually in such an aquifer the groundwater isotope value is similar to the weighted mean of the annual rainwater isotopic signature but the slight isotopic enrichment of groundwater observed here accurately coincides with the runoff mean of 36 6 for δ2h and 6 06 for δ18o fig 8b nevertheless the d excess being most of the time around 11 13 in all groundwater samples evaporation is not the main process occurring during runoff the enrichment seems then rather related to a rapid infiltration of rainwater occurring also during winter spring with less negative isotopic values than fall winter rainwater table 2 rapid infiltration of runoff waters is realistic taking into account the heterogeneity of the study site described in the study area section this is also well supported by the median annual aquifer recharge rate about 26 of the 508 mm of total annual rainfall described previously fig 2 this value is indeed relatively high compared to similar carbonate coastal aquifers in the western mediterranean whose recharge rate is generally from 9 to 18 ghiglieri et al 2014 stigter et al 2014 all these conclusions argue strongly in favour of a predominant focused recharge process within the bonifacio aquifer on which are superimposed diffuse msr and irrigation processes 4 7 focused recharge and water resource availability recently evidence of the dependence of groundwater resources on extreme rainfall were made in east africa taylor et al 2013b their groundwater isotope signatures were different from a weighted mean of rainwater due to el nino southern oscillation and indian ocean dipole mode disproportional contribution to recharge highlighting then the role of extreme rain events favouring aquifer recharge since high rainfall events are predicted to be more and more frequent in the mediterranean scanlon et al 2006 this change in rainfall scheme should have consequences on the aquifers recharge conditions it appears necessary to evaluate if the mediterranean climatic trends are verified at the local scale in the present study in this aim the number of daily rainfall events per decade for the 1960 2009 period provided by météo france are presented in fig 9 for the southern corsica area for rainfall events up to 60 mm day no noticeable variation is visible in contrast a clear increase in the 80 200 mm day events appears for the last two decades as an example the number of daily rainfall amounts about 100 mm increase from 17 to 23 for the 1960 1989 period to 30 31 for the 1990 2009 period this is the same for rainfall amounts about 140 mm with an increase from 4 to 6 for the 1960 1989 period to 13 16 for the 1990 2009 period the global climatic trends implying an increase in high rainfall events are thereby verified at the local scale of the bonifacio aquifer a very good linear correlation is observable between the annual rainfall amounts and the corresponding recharge rates with an r2 about 0 92 this observation implies that more intense rain events means more favourable recharge conditions this is well illustrated by the highest recharge rates observed recently 1996 2004 2008 2010 and 2013 with values between 40 and 45 324 403 mm of the annual rainfall amount fig 2 table 1 the authors are aware that by using the espere code the recharge rate should increase with increased precipitation but this observation is still realistic since a focused recharge process prevails within the bonifacio aquifer indeed focused recharge is known to favour aquifer recharge rates in regions with heterogeneous subsurface characteristics because water is rapidly passed downward de vries and simmers 2002 scanlon et al 2002 meixner et al 2016 hartmann et al 2017 the present findings indicate that the climate change seems to enhance groundwater availability of such heterogeneous mediterranean coastal aquifers as suggested by the projections of hartmann et al 2017 5 conclusions the findings of this study clearly demonstrate that the sensitivity of groundwater renewal of mediterranean coastal aquifers is dependent on the prevailing recharge process for the first time a monthly two years monitoring approach combining major ions and stable isotopes of water in rain runoff and ground waters allowed to observe and characterize four recharge processes within a heterogeneous coastal aquifer in the mediterranean area the groundwater isotopic signatures clearly demonstrate the domination of the focused recharge process on which are superimposed diffuse msr and irrigation processes the very good correlation between the rainfall amount and the recharge rate in bonifacio implies actually that more intense rain events consequently means more favourable recharge conditions rapid infiltration of runoff waters is most likely caused by the surface heterogeneity of the study site high rainfall events being predicted to be more frequent in the future focused recharge constitutes thus an important process favouring aquifers recharge in mediterranean regions with heterogeneous subsurface characteristics the findings of the present paper are strategic because coastal aquifers are the most vulnerable hydrosystems to climate change since they are exposed to seawater intrusion which can get worse due to low recharge conditions sea level rise and over pumping risks better constrained aquifer recharge rates and recharge processes contribute to guarantee the water resources sustainability and availability especially when recharge conditions are not favourable and highly variable such as under semi arid or mediterranean climate likely water management strategies including adapted water management plans have to take into account the variable flow dynamics of such aquifers with heterogeneous recharge behaviour groundwater pumping rates could be then adapted to the temporally variable water availability this issue is especially acute in the mediterranean region where the expected high inter annual variability of recharge will require adapted measures for water resources protection and management to use the potential additional recharge evidenced in this study acknowledgement the ph d grant of

7413,the aim of this study is to examine the contribution of north atlantic tropical cyclones tcs to flooding and heavy rainfall across the continental united states analyses highlight the spatial variability in these hazards their temporal changes in terms of frequency and magnitude and their connection to large scale climate in particular to the north atlantic oscillation nao and el niño southern oscillation enso we use long term stream and rain gage measurements and our analyses are based on annual maxima ams and peaks over threshold pots tcs contribute to 20 30 of ams and pots over florida and coastal areas of the eastern united states and the contribution decreases as we move inland we do not detect statistically significant trends in the magnitude or frequency of tc floods regarding the role of climate nao and enso do not play a large role in controlling the frequency and magnitude of tc flooding the connection between heavy rainfall and tcs is comparable to what observed in terms of flooding unlike flooding nao plays a significant role in tc related extreme rainfall along the u s east coast while enso is most strongly linked to the tc precipitation in texas keywords north atlantic tropical cyclones flood extreme rainfall eastern united states north atlantic oscillation el niño southern oscillation 1 introduction almost on a yearly basis the united states has been plagued by north atlantic tropical cyclones tcs which caused several fatalities and massive economic losses e g rappaport 2014 pielke et al 2008 czajkowski et al 2011 2013 2017 about 50 of the total u s landfalling tcs during 1963 2012 caused at least one fatality rappaport 2014 and with the exception of drought heat total economic loss due to tcs during 1980 2003 was nearly twice the losses from any other single weather disaster ross and lott 2003 widespread torrential rain caused by tcs and subsequent flooding contribute significantly to total fatalities and economic losses associated with these storms e g rappaport 2014 ross and lott 2003 czajkowski et al 2013 2017 the most recent example is hurricane harvey 2017 which brought extremely large rainfall amounts along coastal texas and was responsible for extreme flooding in particular in the houston metropolitan area landfalling tcs contribute significantly 50 to extreme precipitation events along the florida panhandle and the u s east coast e g kunkel et al 2010 knight and davis 2009 khouakhi et al 2017 showed that tcs are responsible for large fractions 30 of annual maximum and heavy precipitation events along the gulf coast florida and the eastern united states moreover the heavy rainfall from landfalling hurricanes may play some role in mitigating drought conditions in the southeastern united states misra and bastola 2016 there has also been some evidence pointing to increasing trends in tc rainfall rate and frequency over the united states kunkel et al 2010 zhu and quiring 2013 although heavy rainfall is a key ingredient for flooding and hence for the associated losses previous studies noted the crucial role of other hydrological variables such as soil moisture basin shape and size e g sturdevant rees et al 2001 villarini et al 2014a therefore rainfall alone may not always be a good proxy for subsequent flooding some recent studies have analyzed the role tcs play for u s flooding for instance villarini and smith 2010 showed that tcs are responsible for some of the largest flood events across the eastern united states while villarini and smith 2013 found that these storms play a smaller role over texas analyzing flooding associated with landfalling tcs during 1981 2011 villarini et al 2014a found that large areas of the eastern united states experienced major flooding i e flood magnitude greater than the 10 year flood event related to tcs moreover they highlighted the contribution of tcs to flooding across the central united states even though there are few studies examining the characteristics and temporal changes of tc rainfall the question of whether the tc flood characteristics have been changing over time and the nature of these changes still remains unexplored north atlantic tc activity is substantially controlled by local climate variability and teleconnections excited by remote forcing e g gray 1984 elsner 2003 latif et al 2007 vecchi and soden 2007 landsea 2000 villarini and vecchi 2012 zhang et al 2017a among others the el niño southern oscillation enso and the north atlantic oscillation nao have been found to exert a large influence on the tc activity murakami et al 2016a b landsea 2000 elsner et al 2000 kossin et al 2010 villarini et al 2010 in general enso influences the frequency of cyclogenesis through variation in vertical wind shear in the north atlantic frank and young 2007 elsner et al 2001 landsea 2000 on the other hand nao can play an important role in modulating tc tracks because of the location of the subtropical high e g elsner et al 2000 colbert and soden 2012 elsner 2003 because the tc activity is influenced by enso and nao it is likely that these climate modes are also related to the associated heavy rainfall and flooding for instance khouakhi et al 2017 showed that there is an increased probability of tc induced extreme rainfall over the united states during la niña or negative phase of enso similarly villarini et al 2014a qualitatively showed that tc flood peaks tend to be larger during the negative phase of nao and highlighted the regional differences in terms of the tc flood hazard for different enso phases pielke and landsea 1999 also found a significant relationship between the enso cycle and u s hurricane losses even though there has been a lot of effort in relating north atlantic tc activity with climate little is known about if and how climate controls tc flooding more generally the phase and magnitude of enso and nao mediate the low level jet and the monsoonal system lee et al 2013 krishnamurthy et al 2015 wang 2007 weaver and nigam 2008 which play an important role in driving heavy precipitation over the southern and central united states and the u s east coast by modulating moisture flux transport from the tropical atlantic and the gulf of mexico e g barlow et al 1998 helfand and schubert 1995 higgins et al 1997 mo and berbery 2004 stensrud 1996 wang 2007 wu and raman 1998 because of these knowledge gaps the research questions we will address in this study are what is the contribution of north atlantic tcs to the magnitude and frequency of flooding and heavy rainfall across the united states can we detect temporal changes in the magnitude and frequency of tc related flooding and heavy rainfall what is the role played by enso and nao in controlling flooding and heavy rainfall associated with u s landfalling tcs the paper is organized as follows the data and methods are described in the next section the results are presented in section 3 which is followed by section 4 where we summarize the main points and conclude the article 2 methodology we use u s geological survey usgs daily discharge records from stream gages with at least 50 complete years a complete year is defined as a year with at least 330 daily observations and ending no earlier than 2010 fig 1 shows the record length and the location of stream gages we include in our analyses there are about 2500 complete usgs stations affected by north atlantic tcs of which 338 belong to the usgs hydro climatic data network 2009 hcdn 2009 usgs 2012 and are sites screened for human activities and can be considered pristine the record length ranges from 50 to 153 years and a large number of stations have discharge measurements from 1950 onwards precipitation analyses are based on the unified gauge based daily observation data higgins et al 2000 provided by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa climate prediction center cpc these data provide daily accumulated precipitation with a 0 25 resolution from 1948 onwards the north atlantic tc data were obtained from the national hurricane center best track hurricane database hurdat2 landsea and

ncar reanalysis 1 with a spatial resolution of 2 5 2 5 https www esrl noaa gov psd data gridded data ncep reanalysis html the vertically integrated moisture flux from the 1000 hpa to 300 hpa level is calculated based on specific humidity zonal and meridional winds see zhang et al 2017b for more details for any particular stream gage we selected tc related annual maximum discharge qmax tc if the stream gage was within 500 km from the storm center and the annual maximum discharge was measured within the time window of one day prior and five days after the passage of the storm the choice of the 500 km search radius is consistent with villarini et al 2014b who showed that for the north atlantic most of the tc rainfall is concentrated within a 5 degree 500 km radius the 2 year return period flood q2 for any station was calculated with respect to an 11 year moving window to mitigate the sampling errors associated with the estimation of quantiles from limited samples we calculated q2 only for those periods that contained at least ten complete years the qmax tc was divided by the corresponding q2 and the ratio defined as flood ratio fr was used to analyze tc flood characteristics at the regional scale fr compares the tc flooding at a given location with respect to the reference at site flood value and it can be used to compare tc flooding across watersheds with different catchment sizes e g villarini et al 2014a czajkowski et al 2013 2017 rowe and villarini 2013 also as q2 varies over time it allows accounting for potential changes in flood frequency over these long records similarly tc related annual maximum daily precipitation pptmax tc for any particular pixel was selected if the pixel was located within 500 km from the center of circulation of the storm and the annual maximum daily precipitation was recorded within the time window of one day prior and one day after the passage of the storm we examine the presence of trends in fr and pptmax tc using the mann kendall test e g helsel and hirsch 1992 this test is widely used in studies examining trends in extremes because it is non parametric i e it does not require any distributional assumptions and is robust against outliers we perform the analyses only at the stream gages or rainfall pixels that have at least five events associated with tcs to analyze the frequency of tc related flooding and heavy rainfall we use a peak over threshold pot approach e g davidson and smith 1990 the threshold to identify flood events was selected such that there are two events per year on average moreover to avoid considering the same event twice only one value within a 15 day window was selected from all the pot events tc related peaks are selected as described for qmax tc and the total number of pots related to tc qpot tc are calculated for all the available years for precipitation we select the 95th percentile of the non zero precipitation distribution at each pixel tc related pot precipitation events were selected as in pmax tc and the total number of heavy precipitation days over the threshold within any particular year is the frequency of heavy precipitation ppot tc we use poisson regression to test whether there are trends in the frequency of tc related flood qpot tc and heavy precipitation ppot tc events as in the fr and pmax tc we analyzed stream gages or pixels having a minimum of five years with at least one tc related pot discharge qpot tc or precipitation ppot ppt in a year the role of enso and nao on the occurrence of tc related annual maximum flooding and precipitation is analyzed using logistic regression e g fox 2015 for any particular year the response variable is 1 or 0 based on whether the annual maximum discharge or daily precipitation was due to tcs or not while the predictors are the values of the enso or nao indices for that year 1 log π 1 π α β 1 x 1 β 2 x 2 where π is the probability of occurrence of tc related annual maximum discharge or precipitation the coefficients α β1 and β2 are estimated using maximum likelihood for enso we use the niño 3 4 index available from cpc http www cpc ncep noaa gov products analysis monitoring ensostuff ensoyears shtml averaged over the august october period because the classic nao is mostly a winter mode we use the geographically varying mobile nao index portis et al 2001 averaged over the august october period we use poisson regression to quantify the effects of enso and or nao on the frequency of tc related flooding and heavy precipitation the number of qpot tc or ppot tc per year represents the response variable while enso and or nao are the predictors we related the rate of occurrence parameter for the poisson distribution for a given year with these two predictors using a logarithmic link function we consider four different models for both logistic and poisson regression 1 a base model with no predictors 2 a model with nao as the only predictor 3 a model with enso as the only predictor 4 a model with both nao and enso to select the best model we use the akaike information criterion aic akaike 1974 which represents a compromise between accuracy and parsimony tc tracks are largely influenced by steering flow which is defined as 500 hpa mid tropospheric wind fields george and gray 1976 chan and gray 1982 the results are consistent when we use the pressure weighted deep layer mean from 850 hpa to 300 hpa wind fields as steering flow 3 results about 2400 complete usgs stations experienced at least one am and or pot due to north atlantic tcs fig 2 top row stream gages in florida show the highest fraction 30 of tc related ams followed by coastal north carolina 25 30 and the gulf coast 10 the results for the pots are similar results also show the mixed population of floods caused by different climatic processes in the region e g villarini 2016 smith et al 2011 with significant contributions by tcs we also examined the contribution of tcs to annual maximum and heavy precipitation events fig 2 bottom panels overall the areas experiencing tc induced extreme rainfall are consistent with those for flooding discussed before even though the fractional contributions are overall larger large areas from the gulf coast to the u s north east show large fractions of am precipitation due to tcs 20 along the gulf coast to 35 in coastal carolina virginia the tc contribution to pots is slightly lower compared to the am precipitation particularly in the coastal regions this suggests that mechanisms other than tcs are largely responsible for heavy precipitation events in the region e g smith et al 2011 these findings are also consistent with khouakhi et al 2017 who showed similar contributions to am precipitation 30 and the contribution to pots tend to be lower along the u s east coast the relatively small fractions of tc flooding over the carolinas are not qualitatively consistent with the general expectation from observed larger percentage of tc related annual maximum precipitation over the region e g barlow 2011 kunkel et al 2010 indicating that other mechanisms e g antecedent soil moisture conditions play a significant role as well e g hellin et al 1999 sturdevant rees et al 2001 the appalachian mountains represent a natural barrier with higher lower tc contributions to their east west as shown in fig 2 the tc contribution to heavy flooding and extreme precipitation events decreases as we move inland and the results are generally consistent with previous studies e g prat and nelson 2013 khouakhi et al 2017 the mann kendall test and poisson regression were used to determine whether tc flood magnitude fr and frequency qpot tc changed over time fig 3 while there are some sites with increasing decreasing trends in the magnitude or frequency of tc related flooding there is not a strong signal pointing to temporal changes results not significant at the 10 level when we focus on precipitation fig 3 bottom panels overall we arrive at similar conclusions however it is also worth pointing out that there are some regions to the west of the appalachian mountains and along the gulf coast that point to an increasing frequency in tc related pot rainfall events also consistent with kunkel et al 2010 after analyzing the temporal changes in the magnitude and frequency of tc related flooding and heavy precipitation and their spatial variations we focus on the role played by nao and enso in controlling the occurrence of these events fig 4 left column summarizes the results from logistic regression showing the control by nao on the occurrence of tc induced annual maximum flood events at different levels of significance most of the region shows negative values for the β coefficient fig 4a implying that tcs are more less likely to produce annual maximum flow during the negative positive phase of the nao however very few stations along the u s east coast show statistically significant results we find similar patterns and results when we examine the contribution of the nao to pot flood events fig 5 a the analyses based on enso figs 4 and 5 panel b indicate that tcs are more less likely to generate an annual maximum flood in the coastal region if they occur during the negative positive phase of enso the results are similar for the frequency of these events even though they are weaker fig 5b these results suggest that enso plays a role not only in terms of tc frequency e g landsea 2000 but also in terms of their tracks e g bove et al 1998 kossin et al 2010 villarini et al 2014a the results so far focused on treating nao and enso as predictors in isolation from each other however when we consider both of them as potential predictors their roles weaken figs 4 and 5 bottom panels and a model with no predictors is generally selected consistent with the fact that the coefficients in figs 4 and 5 top panels were not statistically significant therefore these results further indicate that nao and enso are not relevant predictors in explaining the frequency of tc floods and the probability of tc annual maxima we further analyzed the control of nao and enso on the occurrence of annual maxima and heavy precipitation events due to tcs figs 6 and 7 overall nao and enso affect the probability of having an annual maximum associated with a tc in a manner similar to what observed for flooding fig 4 the strongest signal is east of the appalachian mountains for nao and along the gulf coast in particular in texas for enso when we consider each predictor separately the results from the multiple regression models support these conclusions fig 6 bottom panels and suggest that these climate modes have limited influence in terms of tc related annual maxima on the other hand the picture changes significantly when we focus on the frequency of tc related pot events fig 7 during the negative phase of the nao we expect on average a larger number of pot events due to tcs across the eastern united states in particular east of the appalachian mountains enso instead plays a significant role in the gulf coast in particular in louisiana and texas with more tc related pot events to be expected during la niña years broadly speaking our findings are consistent with previous studies for instance khouakhi et al 2017 showed that tc driven extreme rainfall events along the u s east coast and the gulf coast of mexico are more likely during la niña years nogueira et al 2012 found that tc rainfall in texas is negatively positively correlated with el niño la niña years the higher likelihood of tc related precipitation events during the negative phase of nao can be attributed to the variability in the storm track represented by tc track density which is obtained by binning 6 h tc locations into 6 6 grids fig 8 during the negative phase of the nao there are positive tc track density anomalies over florida and the central north atlantic while there are negative anomalies in the gulf of mexico and the caribbean the opposite is true for the positive nao phase the high tc track density during the negative nao phase is tied to higher tc genesis density in the caribbean and the southwesterly and southeasterly steering flow at the mid tropospheric level 500 hpa in the caribbean and eastern part of gulf of mexico fig 9 top panel thus the changes in storm track cause the higher frequency of tc related extremes along the u s east coast during the negative nao phase moreover the moisture flux associated with the negative nao phase features a path from the gulf of mexico to the eastern united states similar to the path of low level jets suggesting favorable conditions for heavy precipitation fig 10 top panel by contrast the northeasterly steering flow e g elsner et al 2001 2003 during the positive nao phase tends to deflect tcs away from the eastern united states in addition tc genesis anomalies during different nao phases appear to be weak fig 9 the moisture flux during the positive nao phase is the opposite of that during the negative nao phase fig 10 similarly enso affects the probability of tc induced extreme precipitation due to the changes in cyclogenesis frequency through the changes in vertical wind shear and lower tropospheric vorticity tc frequency in the north atlantic basin decreases increases during el niño la niña events fig 11 consistent with previous studies e g landsea 2000 shaman et al 2009 there are also large tc densities during la nina years in the states along the gulf of mexico fig 11 we can see highly negative tc density anomalies in mexico and weak negative anomalies in the southern texas during el niño years fig 11 bottom panel the easterly steering flow in the gulf of mexico and east of the southeastern united states together with the positive anomalies of tc genesis in the gulf of mexico is favorable for higher tc density in the states along the gulf during la niña years fig 12 the prevalent weak westerly steering flow anomalies in the gulf of mexico and weak tc genesis anomalies in the gulf of mexico close to texas louisiana mississippi and alabama indicate weak tc density anomalies in these states figs 11 and 12 the moisture flux transport during la niña years features a path from the atlantic to the gulf of mexico conducive to a larger amount of precipitation fig 13 however the moisture flux anomalies during el niño years are much weaker than those during la niña years fig 13 in addition the moisture flux anomalies during neutral enso phases are weak and show characters similar to la niña years in the gulf of mexico 4 summary and discussion in this study flooding and heavy precipitation associated with north atlantic tcs over the continental united states were analyzed using long term observational records we focused on long term trends in the frequency and magnitude of extreme events associated with these storms and on the role of nao and enso in modulating the probability of these extreme events our findings can be summarized as follows tcs are responsible for significant fractions of flooding and extreme precipitation events over the eastern united states and the gulf coast the tc contribution to annual maximum flood events can be as large as 40 over florida and the influence of these storms decreases as we move inland in terms of precipitation we obtained similar results in terms of spatial distribution even though the fractional contributions were generally larger overall tcs contribute more to the annual maxima than to the pot flood events moving forward these impacts are projected to change with projected changes in tc precipitation e g knutson et al 2013 villarini et al 2014b that could lead to significant economic impacts czajkowski et al 2017 our examination of the temporal changes in tc flooding does not point to statistically significant changes in their magnitude or frequency in terms of precipitation we identified areas west of and along the appalachian mountains where the frequency of tc pot events has been increasing during the study period given the connection between tcs and nao enso we examined the role played by these climate modes in controlling the frequency of pot events and the probability of having an annual maximum caused by these storms our analyses do not point to a strong connection between flooding and nao or enso on the other hand we identified a much stronger relationship with respect to the frequency of heavy precipitation events more specifically we found that the nao plays a significant role along the u s east coast while the role of enso is more towards the western part of the gulf of mexico including louisiana and texas therefore given that nao and enso influence flooding and heavy precipitation associated with tcs differently it is likely that there are other non climate related drivers e g antecedent soil moisture conditions that would explain these differences given the large human modifications that many watersheds in the united states have undergone we have also focused on a subset of 338 stream gages that are part of the hcdn 2009 network and can be considered pristine fig 1 overall we do not find large differences between the pristine and non pristine sites in terms of fractional contribution of tcs to annual maxima and pots

7413,the aim of this study is to examine the contribution of north atlantic tropical cyclones tcs to flooding and heavy rainfall across the continental united states analyses highlight the spatial variability in these hazards their temporal changes in terms of frequency and magnitude and their connection to large scale climate in particular to the north atlantic oscillation nao and el niño southern oscillation enso we use long term stream and rain gage measurements and our analyses are based on annual maxima ams and peaks over threshold pots tcs contribute to 20 30 of ams and pots over florida and coastal areas of the eastern united states and the contribution decreases as we move inland we do not detect statistically significant trends in the magnitude or frequency of tc floods regarding the role of climate nao and enso do not play a large role in controlling the frequency and magnitude of tc flooding the connection between heavy rainfall and tcs is comparable to what observed in terms of flooding unlike flooding nao plays a significant role in tc related extreme rainfall along the u s east coast while enso is most strongly linked to the tc precipitation in texas keywords north atlantic tropical cyclones flood extreme rainfall eastern united states north atlantic oscillation el niño southern oscillation 1 introduction almost on a yearly basis the united states has been plagued by north atlantic tropical cyclones tcs which caused several fatalities and massive economic losses e g rappaport 2014 pielke et al 2008 czajkowski et al 2011 2013 2017 about 50 of the total u s landfalling tcs during 1963 2012 caused at least one fatality rappaport 2014 and with the exception of drought heat total economic loss due to tcs during 1980 2003 was nearly twice the losses from any other single weather disaster ross and lott 2003 widespread torrential rain caused by tcs and subsequent flooding contribute significantly to total fatalities and economic losses associated with these storms e g rappaport 2014 ross and lott 2003 czajkowski et al 2013 2017 the most recent example is hurricane harvey 2017 which brought extremely large rainfall amounts along coastal texas and was responsible for extreme flooding in particular in the houston metropolitan area landfalling tcs contribute significantly 50 to extreme precipitation events along the florida panhandle and the u s east coast e g kunkel et al 2010 knight and davis 2009 khouakhi et al 2017 showed that tcs are responsible for large fractions 30 of annual maximum and heavy precipitation events along the gulf coast florida and the eastern united states moreover the heavy rainfall from landfalling hurricanes may play some role in mitigating drought conditions in the southeastern united states misra and bastola 2016 there has also been some evidence pointing to increasing trends in tc rainfall rate and frequency over the united states kunkel et al 2010 zhu and quiring 2013 although heavy rainfall is a key ingredient for flooding and hence for the associated losses previous studies noted the crucial role of other hydrological variables such as soil moisture basin shape and size e g sturdevant rees et al 2001 villarini et al 2014a therefore rainfall alone may not always be a good proxy for subsequent flooding some recent studies have analyzed the role tcs play for u s flooding for instance villarini and smith 2010 showed that tcs are responsible for some of the largest flood events across the eastern united states while villarini and smith 2013 found that these storms play a smaller role over texas analyzing flooding associated with landfalling tcs during 1981 2011 villarini et al 2014a found that large areas of the eastern united states experienced major flooding i e flood magnitude greater than the 10 year flood event related to tcs moreover they highlighted the contribution of tcs to flooding across the central united states even though there are few studies examining the characteristics and temporal changes of tc rainfall the question of whether the tc flood characteristics have been changing over time and the nature of these changes still remains unexplored north atlantic tc activity is substantially controlled by local climate variability and teleconnections excited by remote forcing e g gray 1984 elsner 2003 latif et al 2007 vecchi and soden 2007 landsea 2000 villarini and vecchi 2012 zhang et al 2017a among others the el niño southern oscillation enso and the north atlantic oscillation nao have been found to exert a large influence on the tc activity murakami et al 2016a b landsea 2000 elsner et al 2000 kossin et al 2010 villarini et al 2010 in general enso influences the frequency of cyclogenesis through variation in vertical wind shear in the north atlantic frank and young 2007 elsner et al 2001 landsea 2000 on the other hand nao can play an important role in modulating tc tracks because of the location of the subtropical high e g elsner et al 2000 colbert and soden 2012 elsner 2003 because the tc activity is influenced by enso and nao it is likely that these climate modes are also related to the associated heavy rainfall and flooding for instance khouakhi et al 2017 showed that there is an increased probability of tc induced extreme rainfall over the united states during la niña or negative phase of enso similarly villarini et al 2014a qualitatively showed that tc flood peaks tend to be larger during the negative phase of nao and highlighted the regional differences in terms of the tc flood hazard for different enso phases pielke and landsea 1999 also found a significant relationship between the enso cycle and u s hurricane losses even though there has been a lot of effort in relating north atlantic tc activity with climate little is known about if and how climate controls tc flooding more generally the phase and magnitude of enso and nao mediate the low level jet and the monsoonal system lee et al 2013 krishnamurthy et al 2015 wang 2007 weaver and nigam 2008 which play an important role in driving heavy precipitation over the southern and central united states and the u s east coast by modulating moisture flux transport from the tropical atlantic and the gulf of mexico e g barlow et al 1998 helfand and schubert 1995 higgins et al 1997 mo and berbery 2004 stensrud 1996 wang 2007 wu and raman 1998 because of these knowledge gaps the research questions we will address in this study are what is the contribution of north atlantic tcs to the magnitude and frequency of flooding and heavy rainfall across the united states can we detect temporal changes in the magnitude and frequency of tc related flooding and heavy rainfall what is the role played by enso and nao in controlling flooding and heavy rainfall associated with u s landfalling tcs the paper is organized as follows the data and methods are described in the next section the results are presented in section 3 which is followed by section 4 where we summarize the main points and conclude the article 2 methodology we use u s geological survey usgs daily discharge records from stream gages with at least 50 complete years a complete year is defined as a year with at least 330 daily observations and ending no earlier than 2010 fig 1 shows the record length and the location of stream gages we include in our analyses there are about 2500 complete usgs stations affected by north atlantic tcs of which 338 belong to the usgs hydro climatic data network 2009 hcdn 2009 usgs 2012 and are sites screened for human activities and can be considered pristine the record length ranges from 50 to 153 years and a large number of stations have discharge measurements from 1950 onwards precipitation analyses are based on the unified gauge based daily observation data higgins et al 2000 provided by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa climate prediction center cpc these data provide daily accumulated precipitation with a 0 25 resolution from 1948 onwards the north atlantic tc data were obtained from the national hurricane center best track hurricane database hurdat2 landsea and

ncar reanalysis 1 with a spatial resolution of 2 5 2 5 https www esrl noaa gov psd data gridded data ncep reanalysis html the vertically integrated moisture flux from the 1000 hpa to 300 hpa level is calculated based on specific humidity zonal and meridional winds see zhang et al 2017b for more details for any particular stream gage we selected tc related annual maximum discharge qmax tc if the stream gage was within 500 km from the storm center and the annual maximum discharge was measured within the time window of one day prior and five days after the passage of the storm the choice of the 500 km search radius is consistent with villarini et al 2014b who showed that for the north atlantic most of the tc rainfall is concentrated within a 5 degree 500 km radius the 2 year return period flood q2 for any station was calculated with respect to an 11 year moving window to mitigate the sampling errors associated with the estimation of quantiles from limited samples we calculated q2 only for those periods that contained at least ten complete years the qmax tc was divided by the corresponding q2 and the ratio defined as flood ratio fr was used to analyze tc flood characteristics at the regional scale fr compares the tc flooding at a given location with respect to the reference at site flood value and it can be used to compare tc flooding across watersheds with different catchment sizes e g villarini et al 2014a czajkowski et al 2013 2017 rowe and villarini 2013 also as q2 varies over time it allows accounting for potential changes in flood frequency over these long records similarly tc related annual maximum daily precipitation pptmax tc for any particular pixel was selected if the pixel was located within 500 km from the center of circulation of the storm and the annual maximum daily precipitation was recorded within the time window of one day prior and one day after the passage of the storm we examine the presence of trends in fr and pptmax tc using the mann kendall test e g helsel and hirsch 1992 this test is widely used in studies examining trends in extremes because it is non parametric i e it does not require any distributional assumptions and is robust against outliers we perform the analyses only at the stream gages or rainfall pixels that have at least five events associated with tcs to analyze the frequency of tc related flooding and heavy rainfall we use a peak over threshold pot approach e g davidson and smith 1990 the threshold to identify flood events was selected such that there are two events per year on average moreover to avoid considering the same event twice only one value within a 15 day window was selected from all the pot events tc related peaks are selected as described for qmax tc and the total number of pots related to tc qpot tc are calculated for all the available years for precipitation we select the 95th percentile of the non zero precipitation distribution at each pixel tc related pot precipitation events were selected as in pmax tc and the total number of heavy precipitation days over the threshold within any particular year is the frequency of heavy precipitation ppot tc we use poisson regression to test whether there are trends in the frequency of tc related flood qpot tc and heavy precipitation ppot tc events as in the fr and pmax tc we analyzed stream gages or pixels having a minimum of five years with at least one tc related pot discharge qpot tc or precipitation ppot ppt in a year the role of enso and nao on the occurrence of tc related annual maximum flooding and precipitation is analyzed using logistic regression e g fox 2015 for any particular year the response variable is 1 or 0 based on whether the annual maximum discharge or daily precipitation was due to tcs or not while

precipitation we obtained similar results in terms of spatial distribution even though the fractional contributions were generally larger overall tcs contribute more to the annual maxima than to the pot flood events moving forward these impacts are projected to change with projected changes in tc precipitation e g knutson et al 2013 villarini et al 2014b that could lead to significant economic impacts czajkowski et al 2017 our examination of the temporal changes in tc flooding does not point to statistically significant changes in their magnitude or frequency in terms of precipitation we identified areas west of and along the appalachian mountains where the frequency of tc pot events has been increasing during the study period given the connection between tcs and nao enso we examined the role played by these climate modes in controlling the frequency of pot events and the probability of having an annual maximum caused by these storms our analyses do not point to a strong connection between flooding and nao or enso on the other hand we identified a much stronger relationship with respect to the frequency of heavy precipitation events more specifically we found that the nao plays a significant role along the u s east coast while the role of enso is more towards the western part of the gulf of mexico including louisiana and texas therefore given that nao and enso influence flooding and heavy precipitation associated with tcs differently it is likely that there are other non climate related drivers e g antecedent soil moisture conditions that would explain these differences given the large human modifications that many watersheds in the united states have undergone we have also focused on a subset of 338 stream gages that are part of the hcdn 2009 network and can be considered pristine fig 1 overall we do not find large differences between the pristine and non pristine sites in terms of fractional contribution of tcs to annual maxima and pots

7414,most soil water balance models only consider downward soil water movement driven by gravitational potential and thus cannot simulate upward soil water movement driven by evapotranspiration especially in agricultural areas in addition the models cannot be used for simulating soil water movement in heterogeneous soils and usually require many empirical parameters to resolve these problems this study derives a new one dimensional water balance model for simulating both downward and upward soil water movement in heterogeneous unsaturated zones the new model is based on a hybrid of numerical and statistical methods and only requires four physical parameters the model uses three governing equations to consider three terms that impact soil water movement including the advective term driven by gravitational potential the source sink term driven by external forces e g evapotranspiration and the diffusive term driven by matric potential the three governing equations are solved separately by using the hybrid numerical and statistical methods e g linear regression method that consider soil heterogeneity the four soil hydraulic parameters required by the new models are as follows saturated hydraulic conductivity saturated water content field capacity and residual water content the strength and weakness of the new model are evaluated by using two published studies three hypothetical examples and a real world application the evaluation is performed by comparing the simulation results of the new model with corresponding results presented in the published studies obtained using hydrus 1d and observation data the evaluation indicates that the new model is accurate and efficient for simulating upward soil water flow in heterogeneous soils with complex boundary conditions the new model is used for evaluating different drainage functions and the square drainage function and the power drainage function are recommended computational efficiency of the new model makes it particularly suitable for large scale simulation of soil water movement because the new model can be used with coarse discretization in space and time keywords water balance model drainage function upward flow heterogeneity regression method coarse discretization in space and time 1 introduction since 1970s various numerical methods have been developed to simulate saturated unsaturated soil water movement at various temporal and spatial scales bastiaanssen et al 2007 ranatunga et al 2008 pan et al 2015 vereecken et al 2016 yang et al 2016 among them the two major approaches are numerical solutions of the richards equation and the reservoir cascade scheme richardson 1922 gandolfi et al 2006 wesseling 2009 based on the principle of mass conservation and the darcy buckingham law the richards equation is the fundamental governing equation that describes unsaturated flows and its numerical solutions have been implemented in many public domain and commercial software such as hydrus šimunek et al 2008 swim huth et al 2012 feflow diersch 2013 mike she graham and butts 2005 and tough xu et al 2012 gu and riley 2010 the richards equation has solid theoretical foundation and its numerical solutions have been widely used in studies of groundwater resources assessment groundwater pollution land subsidence sea water invasion soil water and salt transport and agricultural water management yang et al 2016 however using richards equation requires intensive input data and model parameters which are not always available in practice in addition the computational cost for large scale modeling is high due to the highly nonlinearity of the richards equation hayek 2016 liu et al 2016 downer and ogden 2004 shen and phanikumar 2010 the problems above associated with the richards equation can be resolved or alleviated by using the reservoir cascade scheme employed to solve water balance models also known as conceptual models that are physically based on water mass balance in the water balance models simplified or empirical equations different from the darcy buckingham law are used to describe soil water movement zha 2014 many water balance models are currently in use because of their computational efficiency and stability especially in large scale modeling where data and fundamental understanding of the factors and processes of soil water movement are lacking ranatunga et al 2008 the widely used water balance models include swat arnold et al 2012 abeysingha et al 2015 infil 3 0 fill 2008 soilwat holzworth et al 2014 dssat jones et al 2003 budget raes 2002 hydrobal bellot and chirino 2013 and swb westenbroek et al 2010 the major hydrological processes considered in water balance models include precipitation runoff plant interception evaporation transpiration infiltration redistribution and drainage or deep percolation ranatunga et al 2008 the water balance models generally handle the major hydrological processes separately and use physically meaningful parameters to describe individual processes the major soil hydrological processes are driven by the water potential which is composed of the matric potential and the gravitational potential in unsaturated zone yang et al 2016 many water balance models assume that the gravitational potential dominates over matric potential and therefore neglect matric potential and only simulate downward soil water flow driven by gravitational potential arnold et al 2012 fill 2008 jiang et al 2008 as a result the tipping bucket method kendy et al 2003 riha et al 1994 has been used to describe the infiltration redistribution and drainage processes in the vertical direction a soil column is divided into a cascade of buckets each bucket corresponds to a soil layer and can be filled by infiltration and emptied by evapotranspiration and or drainage specifically speaking the infiltration water first fills the top bucket then the excessive infiltration water moves downward to the next bucket until all the infiltration water is allocated in the buckets subsequently the soil water redistribution happens driven by the gravity the soil water can percolate into the next bucket when the soil water content exceeds the field capacity of the overlying bucket and the drainage process is described by a drainage function gandolfi et al 2006 this method is easy to implement numerically without requiring iterative solvers riha et al 1994 however the tipping bucket method described above cannot simulate upward soil water movement because matric potential is neglected and only the gravitational potential is considered jiang et al 2008 kendy et al 2003 in other words due to neglecting matric potential soil water can only be drained downward by gravitational potential or directly depleted by evapotranspiration this is a reasonable assumption when groundwater recharge is the major concern and when the errors introduced by neglecting matric potential is insignificant fill 2008 kendy et al 2003 vaccaro 2007 however when the errors alter soil water movement and salt accumulation at top soil due to the upward flow especially in agricultural areas with strong evapotranspiration rengasamy 2006 valipour 2014 the assumption of neglecting matric potential becomes invalid another problem of the water balance models is that they generally cannot be used for heterogeneous soils take as an example the soil water balance model soilwat in apsim holzworth et al 2014 which originated from ceres maize adnan et al 2017 soilwat considers both upward and downward soil water movement as well as the hydrological processes of runoff infiltration evapotranspiration and redistribution of water by saturated and unsaturated flow the soil water flow driven by matric potential is calculated by introducing hydraulic diffusivity based on an empirical function while soilwat performs well in comparison with swimv2 a numerical model that solves richards equation as shown in verburg 1995 it cannot be applied to heterogeneous soils as soil water moisture is not continuous across the boundaries between different soil types yang et al 2009 in addition to calculate the hydraulic diffusivity two empirical parameters are required for each soil type whereas the empirical parameters do not have physical meanings furthermore soilwat assumes that the evaporation rate is proportional to the square root of time and the diffusivity soil water movement is calculated in separate loops for upward and downward flow verburg 1995 these are unreasonable simplifications in this study we develop a new one dimensional water balance model by using hybrid numerical and statistical methods to calculate both upward and downward soil water movement in heterogeneous unsaturated soils the water flow process within one time step has the following four components infiltration allocation redistribution driven by gravitational potential source sink driven by external forces and diffusion driven by matric potential these components are evaluated separately by numerically solving their own governing equations to apply the water balance model to heterogeneous soil we introduce a correction term to describe spatial variability of soils the statistical method used in our model simplifies the model parameters so that the water balance model requires only four parameters that have physical meanings the parameters are saturated hydraulic conductivity k s saturated water content θ s field capacity θ f and residual water content θ r the details of the water balance model are given in section 2 in section 3 two published examples with homogenous and heterogeneous soils are used to test the accuracy of the water balance model and three synthetic examples are designed to evaluate the model performance for eight soil types the impacts of five drainage functions and applicability of our model to different discretization resolutions in space and time are also evaluated by comparing the modeling results with those obtained by using hydrus 1d section 3 also includes a real world application of the model to demonstrate the model s applicability the conclusions of the merits and demerits of the model are given in section 4 2 model development section 2 1 discusses the conceptual model and the governing equations of the water balance model three equations are used to describe the driving forces of soil water movement i e the gravitational potential that drives advective soil water movement external forces acting as source sink terms e g evapotranspiration and the matric potential that drives diffusive soil water movement the three equations are solved sequential first for the advective movement then for the source sink terms and ultimately for the diffusive movement associated with the simulation of the advective soil movement a brief review for existing formulas used to describe the drainage process is provided the actual evapotranspiration a source sink term is calculated by using the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 and the ritchie type method berengena and gavilan 2005 braud et al 2005 raes 2002 after solving the equation for advective movement and source sink terms we solve the diffusion equation to simulate diffusive soil water movement in this step hydraulic diffusivity is represented by a new empirical formula that has three parameters saturated hydraulic conductivity k s saturated water content θ s and residual water content θ r the heterogeneous situations are also considered sections 2 2 2 4 describe the details for solving each equation separately 2 1 conceptual model and governing equations the one dimensional water balance model for the unsaturated zone has four major components to describe the soil water movement process within one time step and they are the allocation of the infiltration water advection driven by the gravitational potential source sink term driven by external forces and diffusion driven by the matric potential the infiltration water is assumed to be allocated instantaneously after irrigation or precipitation and the amount of allocated water for a given layer is calculated as 1 q min m θ s θ i i d where q is the amount of allocated water per unit area of the layer l m is the thickness of the layer l θ is the soil water content l3l 3 of the layer θ s is the saturated water content l3l 3 of the layer i is the quantity of infiltration water per unit area l i d is the allocated amount of infiltration water per unit area specified before the calculation l note that all soil water contents in this paper are in the unit of volumetric soil water content the soil water movement of the allocated water is described by the following governing equations 2 θ t k θ z for advective movement driven by the gravitational potential 3 θ t w for source sink term and 4 θ t z d θ θ z for diffusive movement driven by the matric potential where θ is the soil water content l3l 3 t is the time t k θ is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity lt 1 as a function of soil water content z is the elevation in the vertical direction l w is the source sink term t 1 to account for soil evaporation and root uptake term of crop transpiration d θ is the hydraulic diffusivity l2t 1 d θ k θ h θ where h is the pressure head l 2 2 advective movement driven by gravitational potential when the soil water content exceeds the field capacity of a soil layer the drainage process happens for each homogeneous layer with the thickness m by integrating eq 2 over m we have 5 m d θ dt k θ the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k θ is a function of soil water content θ the relationship between k θ and θ can be described by the van genuchten model that requires five soil hydraulic parameters van genuchten 1980 when the five parameters are not fully known it is possible to characterize the relation by using empirical formulas with smaller number of soil hydraulic parameters these empirical formulas are referred to as drainage functions and the commonly used ones are listed in table 1 eq 5 is compatible with the drainage functions listed in table 1 for example the linear drainage function is chosen for the following mathematical expressions by substituting k θ k s θ θ f θ s θ f into eq 5 after the separation of variables integrating the equation and eliminating an integration constant we obtain the recursion formula of soil water content for a soil layer 6 θ j 1 θ f θ j θ f exp k s m θ s θ f δ t where j and j 1 represent the current and next time steps with an interval of δt t after updating soil water content for the next time step the corresponding flux out of the layer can be calculated the out flux is then added to the underlying layer and the process is repeated for all underlying layers this computation procedure is applicable to all the drainage functions listed in table 1 and examples of numerical simulation using different drainage functions are shown in section 3 2 3 source sink term due to the simple form of eq 3 used to account for the source sink term we can directly integrate the equation over time to obtain 7 θ j 1 θ j w δ t the w term represents actual soil evaporation and crop transpiration which play an important role in the soil water movement the penman monteith formula is used in the water balance model and the process of crop growth is also taken into consideration the procedure of implementing eq 7 is as follows first the reference evapotranspiration is calculated using the climate data and the fao penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 luo et al 2012 valipour 2015 subsequently a crop coefficient kc is used to obtain the crop evapotranspiration et c under standard conditions the ritchie type equation berengena and gavilan 2005 braud et al 2005 raes 2002 is used to estimate the potential soil evaporation e p and the potential crop transpiration t p as follows 8 e p τ et c exp f lai et c 9 t p et c e p where f is a parameter accounting for the interception of incoming solar radiation by the vegetation lai is the leaf area index the e p and t p are assigned to soil layers by the evaporation cumulative distribution function and the root density function respectively the two functions are decrement functions of soil depth and can ensure the major proportion of soil evaporation and crop transpiration occurring in the topsoil the actual soil evaporation and crop transpiration are obtained by discounting e p and t p with the soil water stress coefficient and the method for calculating the two coefficients are derived from fao 56 allen et al 1998 the actual crop transpiration is calculated as follows 10 t a k t t p 11 k t max 0 min 1 θ θ w θ c θ w 12 θ c θ w 1 p w θ f θ w 13 p w p tab 0 04 5 et c where k t is the soil stress coefficient for transpiration p w is the mean fraction of the total available water that can be depleted from the root zone before soil water content stress occurs p tab is a parameter related to the crop type allen et al 1998 the actual soil evaporation is calculated via 14 e a k e e p 15 k e θ θ d θ f θ d where k e is the soil stress coefficient for soil evaporation θ d is the minimum water content under the air dying condition l3l 3 and which is set as the residual water content θ r lastly the eq 7 will be solved by substituting the actual soil evaporation and crop transpiration for each layer 2 4 diffusive soil movement driven by matric potential 2 4 1 diffusion equation the diffusion equation eq 4 is discretized using an implicit finite difference method and then solved with the chasing method of householder 2006 the discrete equation in layer i shown in fig 1 in a homogeneous soil column is 16 m i θ i j 1 θ i j δ t d i 1 2 j θ i j 1 θ i 1 j 1 m i 1 2 m i 2 d i 1 2 j θ i 1 j 1 θ i j 1 m i 1 2 m i 2 where subscript i represents the layer number and the superscript j represents the time level mi 1 mi and mi 1 represent the thickness l of the soil layers denoted by indices i 1 i and i 1 respectively d i 1 2 j represents the geometric mean hydraulic diffusivity l2t 1 of layer i 1 and layer i at the time level j and d i 1 2 j represents the geometric mean hydraulic diffusivity l2t 1 of layer i and layer i 1 at the time level j θ i j θ i j 1 represent the soil water content l3 l 3 of layer i at the time levels j and j 1 θ i 1 j 1 θ i 1 j 1 represent the soil water content l3 l 3 of layer i 1 and layer i 1 at the time level j 1 δt is the time step t 2 4 2 simplified expression of hydraulic diffusivity the hydraulic diffusivity of the unsaturated soil is a non linear function that depends on the soil water content soil texture and structure when using the van genuchten model van genuchten 1980 to represent the soil water characteristics the hydraulic diffusivity function is 17 d θ k θ m n α n θ s θ r 1 α h n m 1 h n 1 18 k θ k s s 1 1 s 1 m m 2 19 s θ θ r θ s θ r where h is the pressure head l θ is the soil water content l3 l 3 θ s and θ r are the saturated and residual water content respectively l3 l 3 k θ is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity lt 1 k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity lt 1 s is the effective saturation α l 1 and n are the two empirical parameters m 1 1 n five parameters are needed to evaluate eq 17 and they are θ s θ r k s α and n since parameters α and n are always difficult to obtain zhu et al 2009 sun et al 2015 vereecken et al 2010 we develop an empirical formula of hydraulic diffusivity to reduce the number of needed parameters from 5 to 3 i e ks θ s and θ r parameters α and n are not needed in the empirical formula since the empirical formula has an exponential form and is a straight line in the semi logarithmic coordinate system we can fit the hydraulic diffusivity of different soils by the linear regression method as shown in fig 2 and the exponential function is 20 d θ 10 a s θ b where a and b are the slope and intercept of a fitted straight line s is the effective saturation the soil hydraulic parameters for each soil type refer to carsel and parrish 1988 and carsel et al 1988 which depend on a soil database including approximately 3000 soils obtained from the u s soil conservation service the regression is mainly based on the soil water content ranging from the field capacity to the saturated water content the fitted line is extrapolated to the soil water content that is smaller than the field capacity the fitted hydraulic diffusivity by the simplified model is usually larger than the values calculated by using the van genuchten model when the soil is dry as shown in fig 2 however the hydraulic diffusivity values are between 10 8 m2 d and 10 4 m2 d for different soil types when the soil water content is close to field capacity these small values of hydraulic diffusivity will result in limited the soil water movement the values are even smaller when the soil water content is below the field capacity for which situation the simplified model cannot result in significant deviations we next establish the relationship between the two coefficients a and b and the saturated hydraulic conductivity by using the piecewise fitting method with the combination of a quadratic curve and a straight line as shown in fig 3 the resulting regression equations are 21 a 0 4014 log 10 k s 2 0 5861 log 10 k s 4 518 log 10 k s 0 9 4 8045 log 10 k s 0 7639 log 10 k s 0 9 22 b 0 12 log 10 k s 2 0 511 log 10 k s 4 1381 log 10 k s 0 9 5 2687 log 10 k s 0 2358 log 10 k s 0 9 by following the two steps above the hydraulic diffusivity of a specific soil type can be formulated by the exponential empirical formula without empirical parameters α and n as shown in fig 2 the empirical exponential function can reasonably describe the hydraulic diffusivity with the three physical meaning parameters k s θ s and θ r 2 4 3 calculating correction term for heterogeneous soils soil water content is discontinuous at the material interface when a soil profile is heterogeneous hills et al 1989 khaleel et al 2002 zha et al 2013 matthews et al 2005a 2005b given that soil water content is a function of matric potential and soil hydraulic parameters the vertical variation of θ in the gradational soil can be expressed as 23 θ z θ h h z l 1 n θ p l p l z where p is a vector composed of n parameters pl l 1 2 n of the soil water retention function this equation indicates that the vertical gradient of soil water content consists of two parts the one caused by the vertical variation of h and the other caused by the vertical variation of the parameters substituting eq 23 into eq 4 the diffusive term driven by the matric potential is 24 θ t z d θ θ z l 1 n θ p l p l z there is an extra term l 1 n θ p l p l z on the right side of eq 24 compared to the equation in the homogeneous soil this is a correction term to the gradient of soil water content for describing the soil variation due to heterogeneity when adopting the van genuchten model to represent the soil water characteristics there are four parameters to describe the correction term and they are the saturated water content θ s l3l 3 the residual water content θ r l3l 3 and two empirical parameters n and α l 1 the analytical expressions of the partial derivative of soil water content with respect to each parameter are 25 θ θ s 1 α h n m s 26 θ θ r 1 1 α h n m 1 s 27 θ α mnh θ s θ r 1 α h n m 1 α h n 1 28 θ n θ s θ r s ln s n n 1 n 1 n 2 s n 1 n 1 ln s n 1 n 1 s n 1 n where s is the effective saturation the four terms θ θ s θ θ r θ α and θ n of different soil types are shown in fig 4 the values of θ θ s and θ θ r can be easily calculated by using eqs 25 and 26 when effective saturation is obtained the value of θ α is close to zero which indicates that this item can be ignored in the correction term eq 28 is complicated and requires parameter n since the values of n are not always available a regression formula is developed to characterize the relationship between n with the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s as shown in fig 5 an exponential function is adopted as there is a strong positive correlation between k s and n as a result parameter n can be calculated via 29 n 0 9509 e 0 72223 log 10 k s 0 9 therefore the diffusive term of the heterogeneous soil can be calculated with three parameters which are the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s the saturated water content θ s and the residual water content θ r considering all the three items the advective term source sink term and the diffusive term in our mass balance model only four soil hydraulic parameters are essential to calculate the soil water movement and they are the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s the field capacity θ f the saturated water content θ s and the residual water content θ r these parameters have physical meanings and are easy to be obtained which makes the water balance model more applicable in practice furthermore because of the implicit difference scheme used to discretize the diffusion equation the water balance model is numerically stabile and thus applicable to the simulations with coarse discretization in space and time 3 model evaluation and application the water balance model is first tested by using two published infiltration cases with the homogeneous and heterogeneous soil conditions then three synthetic examples are designed to evaluate the model with different soil types drainage functions and discretization resolutions in space and time the simulation results are compared with those obtained using hydrus 1d šimunek et al 2008 the water balance model is also applied to a real world lysimeter experiment with climate boundary conditions for these cases the mean absolute relative error are and the root mean squared error rmse schoups et al 2006 zha et al 2017 are used to quantitatively evaluate the misfit between the simulated results of the water balance model and hydrus 1d or observed water content are and rmse are calculated as 30 are 1 n i 1 n y i j h i j h i j 100 31 rmse 1 n i 1 n y i j h i j 2 where the subscript i represents the layer number and the superscript j represents the time level y i j is the simulated result of the proposed model and h i t is the observation or the results from hydrus 1d as the comparison standard 3 1 case 1 infiltration cases two published infiltration examples are used to test the performance of the model accuracy the first one is a case with vertical infiltration in homogeneous soil based on the documentation of unsatchem module for hydrus 2d 3d skagges et al 1970 šimůnek et al 2012 the soil column is 0 6 m in length and filled with the sand with the saturated hydraulic conductivity of 0 6238 m d the column is subjected to ponded infiltration at the surface and the bottom boundary is impermeable the second example based on hills et al 1989 has heterogeneous soils with two soil types berino loamy fine sand and glendale clay loam whose saturated hydraulic conductivity are 5 41 m d and 0 131 m d respectively the soil column is 1 m in length with each soil layer being 0 2 m in length the constant infiltration rate is 0 02 m d the detailed information of the two examples can be found in references skagges et al 1970 šimůnek et al 2012 hills et al 1989 the water balance model is used to simulate the water content profiles under the two conditions and the simulated results are compared with those from references as shown in fig 6 for the homogeneous example the are values for the two profiles at times 3600 s and 7200 s fig 6 a and b are 22 and 12 and the rmse values are 0 088 cm3 cm3 and 0 044 cm3 cm3 the percentage error of the mass balance is 3 10 6 for the water balance model for the second heterogeneous example the are values for the two profiles at times 1d and 5d fig 6 c and d are 6 6 and 13 6 and the rmse values are 0 025 cm3 cm3 and 0 045 cm3 cm3 the percentage error of the mass balance is 5 10 6 for the water balance model the comparison results of the two examples show that the water balance model can capture the characteristic of the infiltration process and keep water balance well both for the homogeneous and heterogeneous soils 3 2 case 2 soil water movement driven by matric potential with various soil types in this numerical example the developed water balance model is used to simulate the soil water movement driven by the matric potential and the main purpose is to evaluate the accuracy of the simplified method for describing the diffusive term as shown in section 2 4 2 the soil column is 2 m in length and the profile is homogeneous with both the top and bottom boundaries being impermeable the initial soil water content of the top half profile is set as 0 15 and the bottom half profile as 0 35 eight types of soils with the soil hydraulic parameters and the field capacity given by carsel and parrish 1988 and ratliff et al 1983 are listed in table 2 the linear drainage function is used in the water balance model the spatial discretization resolution of hydrus 1d and the water balance model are both 2 cm and the time step of the water balance model is a constant value of 0 5 day which is close to the mean time step of hydrus 1d the water balance model is used to simulate the water movement and the simulated soil water content profiles for the different soil types at the 30th day are compared with those of hydrus 1d as shown in fig 7 the soil water content in the top half profile increases over time the increased soil water content is driven by the matric potential since the water movement under gravitational potential is downward the good match of the soil water content in the top half profile of the two models indicates that the water balance model can calculate the upward flow satisfactorily especially for loam and clay we list the are values and the rmse values of the profiles in table 3 the are values are less than 11 and the rmse values are less than 0 05 cm3 cm3 which indicate that the simplify method of diffusivity can reasonably simulate the upward flow driven by matric potential fig 7 shows that there is relative poor performance in the bottom half profile where the soil water content near the saturated water content for loam silty loam and clay loam soils the reason is that in the bottom half profile the gravitational potential and the matric potential simultaneously drive the soil movement as the soil water content in this region exceeds the field capacity whereas the water balance model considers the two forces separately first calculating the downward flow driven by the gravitational potential and then calculating the upward flow driven by the matric potential in other words the model may overestimate the upward flux near the water table which leads to an underestimation of soil water content below water table and an overestimation of soil water content above water table generally speaking this numerical example indicates that the simplify method of diffusivity can reasonably simulate the upward flux driven by the matric potential despite that the water balance model may overestimate the upward flux near a water table furthermore the average simulation time of hydrus 1d is 0 22 s larger than that for the water balance model table 3 which indicates that the water balance model is 3 to 10 times faster than hydrus 1d the percentage error of mass balance is in the order of magnitude of 10 4 for hydrus 1d but 10 7 for the water balance model these indicate that the water balance model is more efficient with better water balance 3 3 case 3 soil water movement with complicated boundary and estimation of drainage functions this numerical example is to evaluate the performance of the water balance model under complex boundary conditions such as under the variable atmospheric boundary condition the numerical example also evaluates the performance of the water balance model for the drainage functions listed in table 1 the soil column of this example is 2 m in length there is no crop on the top boundary and the bottom boundary is impermeable fig 8 shows the top boundary condition including the daily precipitation and the soil evaporation the annual precipitation is 650 mm and the annual soil evaporation is 756 mm the initial water table is in the depth of 0 48 m and the soil water content changes linearly from 0 2 at the surface to saturation at the water table the soil is loam with the soil hydraulic parameters and the field capacity listed in table 2 the spatial discretization of hydrus 1d and the water balance model are both 2 cm and the time step of the water balance model is 0 1 day which is close to the mean time step of hydrus 1d the soil water content profiles at different times of the water balance model with the 5 drainage functions are compared with those of hydrus 1d as shown in fig 9 the results show that the water balance model can simulate the vertical flow satisfactorily the mean rmse values and are values of the 5 drainage functions are listed in table 4 all the rmse values are less than 0 02 m3 m3 and the are values are less than 4 which indicate a good performance of the water balance model specifically speaking the exponential power and square drainage functions have lower rmse values and are values than the other functions the mean soil water content at the depth of 0 10 cm between the water balance model with 5 drainage functions and hydrus 1d are compared in fig 10 the domain volume is used as the weight to average the water content of nodes within the depth of 0 10 cm to obtain the mean water content of hydrus 1d it shows that the water content calculated by the water balance model has the similar trend with those obtained using hydrus 1d but fluctuates more abruptly when the infiltration water or evapotranspiration is directly added to or subtracted from each soil layer while the soil water content in hydrus 1d changes more smoothly the calculated mean soil water content at the depth of 0 10 cm by the water balance model are smaller than the values calculated by hydrus 1d during the first 50 days this difference is attributed to the use of the drainage function when the soil water content ranges from the field capacity θ f to the saturated water content θ s in the water balance model fig 11 shows the relationship between soil water content and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of the van genuchten model and the 5 drainage functions the water balance model has larger unsaturated hydraulic conductivities calculated by the 5 drainage functions when the soil water content exceeds the layer s field capacity as a result the water balance model may overestimate the infiltration when the infiltration is more than the evapotranspiration during the first 50 days and gives smaller soil water content in the top layer during the period from the 200th day to the 300th day the surface soil water content fluctuates more drastically as the influence of the top boundary fig 10 the exponential drainage function overestimates the soil water content while the linear and exponential approximation drainage functions underestimate the soil water content the power and square drainage functions give more accurate results a comprehensive consideration of the performance of each drainage function leads to the conclusion that for the water balance model the power drainage function and square function are recommended due to their satisfactory performance in terms of rmse values and are values and the smaller number of parameters the simulation times of hydrus 1d and the water balance model are 3 5 s and 2 s respectively which indicates that the water balance model is almost 2 times faster than hydrus 1d the percentage error of the mass balance is in the order of magnitude of 10 3 for hydrus 1d but10 4 for the water balance model in general the water balance model is effective and efficient for simulating the water movement in the unsaturated zone under complex top boundary conditions the square function and the power function are chosen as the recommend drainage functions 3 4 case 4 soil water movement in heterogeneous soils with various spatial discretization and time steps in this example heterogeneous soils with complicated boundary conditions are considered to evaluate the performance of the water balance model with different discretization resolutions in space and time the soil column is 2 m in length filled with alternating layers of two types of soil each layer being 0 4 m thick the two soil types are sandy loam and silt loam and the filling starts with silt loam in the first layer the soil hydraulic parameters and field capacity are listed in table 2 the top boundary is the atmospheric boundary and the bottom boundary is impermeable fig 12 plots the daily precipitation and soil evaporation of the top boundary the annual precipitation is 650 mm and the annual soil evaporation is 672 01 mm the initial soil water content is uniform with the value of 0 25 the square drainage function is used in the water balance model in order to evaluate the model applicability to various spatial discretization and time steps under the heterogeneous soil eight modeling scenarios with the spatial discretization and time steps 10 cm 1 h 10 cm 1d 20 cm 1 h 20 cm 1d 20 cm 2d 20 cm 5d 20 cm 10d and 20 cm 15d are used by the water balance model the hydrus 1d model with spatial resolution of 2 cm are adopted as a reference the simulated soil water content profiles of the eight scenarios are compared with those from hydrus 1d as shown in fig 13 the rmse values are values and mass balance errors are listed in table 5 all the scenarios can simulate mass balance well with the percentage mass balance error as being 10 5 or less the first five scenarios obtain very similar results with satisfactory performance in the first third and fifth soil layers as the rmse values are less than 0 041 cm3 cm3 and are values less than 10 4 the are values of the second and the fourth layers increase significantly it is caused by the smaller value of soil water content in the two layers of sandy loam which has smaller water holding capacity and soil water content however the rmse values of the second and the fourth layers are close to 0 04 cm3 cm3 which indicate an acceptable result when we keep the spatial step at 20 cm and increase the time step from 2d 5d 10d to 15d the rmse values and are values become worse especially for the top layers the result of the scenario with the time step of 5d is acceptable however when the time step increases to 10d or 15d the mean are value over the five layers is more than 20 and the mean rmse value over the five layers is close to 0 05 cm3 cm3 which indicates that the results of simulated soil water content are not acceptable the reason is that for a small time step the amount of infiltration is small and limited to the top layers only this water can be removed from the soil layers by evapotranspiration and thus does not reach deeper layers quickly this is similar to what happens in the real case however when the time step is large the amount of infiltration becomes large enough to reach deeper soil layers before the infiltration water is removed by evapotranspiration which leads to smaller soil water content at top layers but larger soil content in deeper layers therefore the simulated soil water content with a large time step are unacceptable generally speaking when the time steps are less than 5 days there will be a proper accuracy of the soil water content furthermore it is found that for the water balance model the accuracy of is similar for all the first five scenarios which indicates that the water balance model yields satisfactory results even for the scenarios with large spatial discretization and time steps under heterogeneous soil conditions with complicated boundary conditions 3 5 case 5 real world application to lysimeter experiment the lysimeter experiment was conducted from november 2003 to june 2004 during the growing season of winter wheat in irrigation and drainage experiment station at wuhan university china wang 2007 zhu et al 2009 2017 the size of the lysimeter is 2 m 2 m 3 m the evapotranspiration was not directly measured and a value of 75 percent of annual mean water requirement of the crop growth is used in this simulation the crop transpiration rate over the soil evaporation rate is assumed to be 3 1 during the crop growing season fig 14 plots the precipitation irrigation rate the crop transpiration rate and the soil evaporation rate the bottom boundary is set as the free drainage condition the soil hydraulic parameters of the lysimeter experiment used in the water balance model are listed in table 6 the time step is 1 h and the spatial step is 10 cm in the water balance model the simulated cumulative evaporation and transpiration are 94 2 mm and 282 7 mm respectively and the simulated flux at the bottom of the lysimeter is 73 7 mm the percentage error of the mass balance for the water balance model is in the order of magnitude of 10 4 fig 15 shows the comparison of simulated and observed soil water content at different times the rmse values of each profile are 0 008 cm3 cm3 0 021 cm3 cm3 0 013 cm3 cm3 and 0 014 cm3 cm3 respectively and the are values are 2 1 6 5 3 1 and 4 7 respectively which indicate a good performance of the water balance model fig 16 shows the comparison of the simulated and observed soil water content over time at different observation layers the soil water content at the depth of 0 1 m fluctuates drastically due to the influence of the top boundary condition the water balance model has a good fit with the observed data except during the time between the 80th day and the 130th day the reason is that the evaporation and transpiration of the top boundary may insufficient to reduce the top soil water content since the mean seasonal value is used at the depth of 0 7 m the water balance model has a good performance while at the depth of 1 3 m and 1 7 m the water balance model shows sharp increases of the water content and this is caused by the assumption that the infiltration water is allocated instantaneously after irrigation or precipitation overall the performance of the water balance model is satisfactorily when using different spatial discretization resolution and time steps the observed soil water content and the simulated results of hydrus 1d and the water balance model over time at different layers are compared in fig 16 the percentage error of the mass balance the mean rmse values the mean are values and the computational costs of the water balance model and hydrus 1d are shown in table 7 when the time step increases from 1 h to 1d and the spatial discretization increases from 10 cm to 20 cm the proposed model can still simulate the observations well the are and rmse do not show worse trend the model also can simulate mass balance well with the percentage error of the mass balance remained as 10 5 the results indicate that the water balance model is suitable for the large spatial discretization and time steps this however is not the case for hydrus 1d while hydrus 1d has good results at the time step of 1 h and spatial discretization of 10 cm the simulation results deteriorate with the increased spatial discretization and time steps the hydrus 1d results are unreasonable in that the soil becomes saturated after the 130th day when the time step of 1 d and spatial discretization of 20 cm which is caused by the intensive irrigation that leads to an iterative error additionally the water balance model is more effective than hydrus 1d as shown in table 7 and the simulation times indicate the computation efficiency of the water balance model is 2 to 4 times faster as a summary the results shown in figs 15 and 16 indicate that the simulated soil water content of the water balance model has a satisfactory agreement with the observed data and the water balance model can be used for coarse spatial discretization and large time steps 4 conclusions this study develops a one dimensional water balance model with physically meaningful parameters for simulating vertical water movement in unsaturated soils the model can effectively and efficiently capture the features of soil water movement the model is evaluated by using both synthetic numerical examples and real world experimental data the major conclusions drawn from this research are as follows 1 the water balance model can simulate both upward and downward flow in the unsaturated zone by considering the advective term driven by the gravitational potential the source sink term and the diffusive term driven by the matric potential individually the model yields satisfactory mass balance even for coarse spatial discretization and large time step which greatly improves the efficiency and applicability of the model 2 when solving the advective soil movement the water balance model is compatible with various drainage functions used to describe the relationship between unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and soil water content the square drainage function and the power drainage function are superior to other functions due to their satisfactory performance and with no empirical parameters 3 a new empirical formula is developed to calculate the diffusivity with three parameters the saturated hydraulic conductivity the saturated water content and the residual water content when solving the diffusive soil movement in the heterogeneous soil a correction term is used and evaluated using the simplified function with the three parameters above 4 applying the water balance model to simulation soil water movement in the unsaturated zone demonstrates the accommodation of the model to the upward flow complex boundary conditions and soil heterogeneity conditions 5 the water balance model may overestimate the upward flux close to water table due to the equations for advective flow source sink term and diffusive flow solved separately acknowledgments the study was partially supported by the national key research and development program of china 2016yfc0501304 and natural science

7414,most soil water balance models only consider downward soil water movement driven by gravitational potential and thus cannot simulate upward soil water movement driven by evapotranspiration especially in agricultural areas in addition the models cannot be used for simulating soil water movement in heterogeneous soils and usually require many empirical parameters to resolve these problems this study derives a new one dimensional water balance model for simulating both downward and upward soil water movement in heterogeneous unsaturated zones the new model is based on a hybrid of numerical and statistical methods and only requires four physical parameters the model uses three governing equations to consider three terms that impact soil water movement including the advective term driven by gravitational potential the source sink term driven by external forces e g evapotranspiration and the diffusive term driven by matric potential the three governing equations are solved separately by using the hybrid numerical and statistical methods e g linear regression method that consider soil heterogeneity the four soil hydraulic parameters required by the new models are as follows saturated hydraulic conductivity saturated water content field capacity and residual water content the strength and weakness of the new model are evaluated by using two published studies three hypothetical examples and a real world application the evaluation is performed by comparing the simulation results of the new model with corresponding results presented in the published studies obtained using hydrus 1d and observation data the evaluation indicates that the new model is accurate and efficient for simulating upward soil water flow in heterogeneous soils with complex boundary conditions the new model is used for evaluating different drainage functions and the square drainage function and the power drainage function are recommended computational efficiency of the new model makes it particularly suitable for large scale simulation of soil water movement because the new model can be used with coarse discretization in space and time keywords water balance model drainage function upward flow heterogeneity regression method coarse discretization in space and time 1 introduction since 1970s various numerical methods have been developed to simulate saturated unsaturated soil water movement at various temporal and spatial scales bastiaanssen et al 2007 ranatunga et al 2008 pan et al 2015 vereecken et al 2016 yang et al 2016 among them the two major approaches are numerical solutions of the richards equation and the reservoir cascade scheme richardson 1922 gandolfi et al 2006 wesseling 2009 based on the principle of mass conservation and the darcy buckingham law the richards equation is the fundamental governing equation that describes unsaturated flows and its numerical solutions have been implemented in many public domain and commercial software such as hydrus šimunek et al 2008 swim huth et al 2012 feflow diersch 2013 mike she graham and butts 2005 and tough xu et al 2012 gu and riley 2010 the richards equation has solid theoretical foundation and its numerical solutions have been widely used in studies of groundwater resources assessment groundwater pollution land subsidence sea water invasion soil water and salt transport and agricultural water management yang et al 2016 however using richards equation requires intensive input data and model parameters which are not always available in practice in addition the computational cost for large scale modeling is high due to the highly nonlinearity of the richards equation hayek 2016 liu et al 2016 downer and ogden 2004 shen and phanikumar 2010 the problems above associated with the richards equation can be resolved or alleviated by using the reservoir cascade scheme employed to solve water balance models also known as conceptual models that are physically based on water mass balance in the water balance models simplified or empirical equations different from the darcy buckingham law are used to describe soil water movement zha 2014 many water balance models are currently in use because of their computational efficiency and stability especially in large scale modeling where data and fundamental understanding of the factors and processes of soil water movement are lacking ranatunga et al 2008 the widely used water balance models include swat arnold et al 2012 abeysingha et al 2015 infil 3 0 fill 2008 soilwat holzworth et al 2014 dssat jones et al 2003 budget raes 2002 hydrobal bellot and chirino 2013 and swb westenbroek et al 2010 the major hydrological processes considered in water balance models include precipitation runoff plant interception evaporation transpiration infiltration redistribution and drainage or deep percolation ranatunga et al 2008 the water balance models generally handle the major hydrological processes separately and use physically meaningful parameters to describe individual processes the major soil hydrological processes are driven by the water potential which is composed of the matric potential and the gravitational potential in unsaturated zone yang et al 2016 many water balance models assume that the gravitational potential dominates over matric potential and therefore neglect matric potential and only simulate downward soil water flow driven by gravitational potential arnold et al 2012 fill 2008 jiang et al 2008 as a result the tipping bucket method kendy et al 2003 riha et al 1994 has been used to describe the infiltration redistribution and drainage processes in the vertical direction a soil column is divided into a cascade of buckets each bucket corresponds to a soil layer and can be filled by infiltration and emptied by evapotranspiration and or drainage specifically speaking the infiltration water first fills the top bucket then the excessive infiltration water moves downward to the next bucket until all the infiltration water is allocated in the buckets subsequently the soil water redistribution happens driven by the gravity the soil water can percolate into the next bucket when the soil water content exceeds the field capacity of the overlying bucket and the drainage process is described by a drainage function gandolfi et al 2006 this method is easy to implement numerically without requiring iterative solvers riha et al 1994 however the tipping bucket method described above cannot simulate upward soil water movement because matric potential is neglected and only the gravitational potential is considered jiang et al 2008 kendy et al 2003 in other words due to neglecting matric potential soil water can only be drained downward by gravitational potential or directly depleted by evapotranspiration this is a reasonable assumption when groundwater recharge is the major concern and when the errors introduced by neglecting matric potential is insignificant fill 2008 kendy et al 2003 vaccaro 2007 however when the errors alter soil water movement and salt accumulation at top soil due to the upward flow especially in agricultural areas with strong evapotranspiration rengasamy 2006 valipour 2014 the assumption of neglecting matric potential becomes invalid another problem of the water balance models is that they generally cannot be used for heterogeneous soils take as an example the soil water balance model soilwat in apsim holzworth et al 2014 which originated from ceres maize adnan et al 2017 soilwat considers both upward and downward soil water movement as well as the hydrological processes of runoff infiltration evapotranspiration and redistribution of water by saturated and unsaturated flow the soil water flow driven by matric potential is calculated by introducing hydraulic diffusivity based on an empirical function while soilwat performs well in comparison with swimv2 a numerical model that solves richards equation as shown in verburg 1995 it cannot be applied to heterogeneous soils as soil water moisture is not continuous across the boundaries between different soil types yang et al 2009 in addition to calculate the hydraulic diffusivity two empirical parameters are required for each soil type whereas the empirical parameters do not have physical meanings furthermore soilwat assumes that the evaporation rate is proportional to the square root of time and the diffusivity soil water movement is calculated in separate loops for upward and downward flow verburg 1995 these are unreasonable simplifications in this study we develop a new one dimensional water balance model by using hybrid numerical and statistical methods to calculate both upward and downward soil water movement in heterogeneous unsaturated soils the water flow process within one time step has the following four components infiltration allocation redistribution driven by gravitational potential source sink driven by external forces and diffusion driven by matric potential these components are evaluated separately by numerically solving their own governing equations to apply the water balance model to heterogeneous soil we introduce a correction term to describe spatial variability of soils the statistical method used in our model simplifies the model parameters so that the water balance model requires only four parameters that have physical meanings the parameters are saturated hydraulic conductivity k s saturated water content θ s field capacity θ f and residual water content θ r the details of the water balance model are given in section 2 in section 3 two published examples with homogenous and heterogeneous soils are used to test the accuracy of the water balance model and three synthetic examples are designed to evaluate the model performance for eight soil types the impacts of five drainage functions and applicability of our model to different discretization resolutions in space and time are also evaluated by comparing the modeling results with those obtained by using hydrus 1d section 3 also includes a real world application of the model to demonstrate the model s applicability the conclusions of the merits and demerits of the model are given in section 4 2 model development section 2 1 discusses the conceptual model and the governing equations of the water balance model three equations are used to describe the driving forces of soil water movement i e the gravitational potential that drives advective soil water movement external forces acting as source sink terms e g evapotranspiration and the matric potential that drives diffusive soil water movement the three equations are solved sequential first for the advective movement then for the source sink terms and ultimately for the diffusive movement associated with the simulation of the advective soil movement a brief review for existing formulas used to describe the drainage process is provided the actual evapotranspiration a source sink term is calculated by using the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 and the ritchie type method berengena and gavilan 2005 braud et al 2005 raes 2002 after solving the equation for advective movement and source sink terms we solve the diffusion equation to simulate diffusive soil water movement in this step hydraulic diffusivity is represented by a new empirical formula that has three parameters saturated hydraulic conductivity k s saturated water content θ s and residual water content θ r the heterogeneous situations are also considered sections 2 2 2 4 describe the details for solving each equation separately 2 1 conceptual model and governing equations the one dimensional water balance model for the unsaturated zone has four major components to describe the soil water movement process within one time step and they are the allocation of the infiltration water advection driven by the gravitational potential source sink term driven by external forces and diffusion driven by the matric potential the infiltration water is assumed to be allocated instantaneously after irrigation or precipitation and the amount of allocated water for a given layer is calculated as 1 q min m θ s θ i i d where q is the amount of allocated water per unit area of the layer l m is the thickness of the layer l θ is the soil water content l3l 3 of the layer θ s is the saturated water content l3l 3 of the layer i is the quantity of infiltration water per unit area l i d is the allocated amount of infiltration water per unit area specified before the calculation l note that all soil water contents in this paper are in the unit of volumetric soil water content the soil water movement of the allocated water is described by the following governing equations 2 θ t k θ z for advective movement driven by the gravitational potential 3 θ t w for source sink term and 4 θ t z d θ θ z for diffusive movement driven by the matric potential where θ is the soil water content l3l 3 t is the time t k θ is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity lt 1 as a function of soil water content z is the elevation in the vertical direction l w is the source sink term t 1 to account for soil evaporation and root uptake term of crop transpiration d θ is the hydraulic diffusivity l2t 1 d θ k θ h θ where h is the pressure head l 2 2 advective movement driven by gravitational potential when the soil water content exceeds the field capacity of a soil layer the drainage process happens for each homogeneous layer with the thickness m by integrating eq 2 over m we have 5 m d θ dt k θ the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k θ is a function of soil water content θ the relationship between k θ and θ can be described by the van genuchten model that requires five soil hydraulic parameters van genuchten 1980 when the five parameters are not fully known it is possible to characterize the relation by using empirical formulas with smaller number of soil hydraulic parameters these empirical formulas are referred to as drainage functions and the commonly used ones are listed in table 1 eq 5 is compatible with the drainage functions listed in table 1 for example the linear drainage function is chosen for the following mathematical expressions by substituting k θ k s θ θ f θ s θ f into eq 5 after the separation of variables integrating the equation and eliminating an integration constant we obtain the recursion formula of soil water content for a soil layer 6 θ j 1 θ f θ j θ f exp k s m θ s θ f δ t where j and j 1 represent the current and next time steps with an interval of δt t after updating soil water content for the next time step the corresponding flux out of the layer can be calculated the out flux is then added to the underlying layer and the process is repeated for all underlying layers this computation procedure is applicable to all the drainage functions listed in table 1 and examples of numerical simulation using different drainage functions are shown in section 3 2 3 source sink term due to the simple form of eq 3 used to account for the source sink term we can directly integrate the equation over time to obtain 7 θ j 1 θ j w δ t the w term represents actual soil evaporation and crop transpiration which play an important role in the soil water movement the penman monteith formula is used in the water balance model and the process of crop growth is also taken into consideration the procedure of implementing eq 7 is as follows first the reference evapotranspiration is calculated using the climate data and the fao penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 luo et al 2012 valipour 2015 subsequently a crop coefficient kc is used to obtain the crop evapotranspiration et c under standard conditions the ritchie type equation berengena and gavilan 2005 braud et al 2005 raes 2002 is used to estimate the potential soil evaporation e p and the potential crop transpiration t p as follows 8 e p τ et c exp f lai et c 9 t p et c e p where f is a parameter accounting for the interception of incoming solar radiation by the vegetation lai is the leaf area index the e p and t p are assigned to soil layers by the evaporation cumulative distribution function and the root density function respectively the two functions are decrement functions of soil depth and can ensure the major proportion of soil evaporation and crop transpiration occurring in the topsoil the actual soil evaporation and crop transpiration are obtained by discounting e p and t p with the soil water stress coefficient and the method for calculating the two coefficients are derived from fao 56 allen et al 1998 the actual crop transpiration is calculated as follows 10 t a k t t p 11 k t max 0 min 1 θ θ w θ c θ w 12 θ c θ w 1 p w θ f θ w 13 p w p tab 0 04 5 et c where k t is the soil stress coefficient for transpiration p w is the mean fraction of the total available water that can be depleted from the root zone before soil water content stress occurs p tab is a parameter related to the crop type allen et al 1998 the actual soil evaporation is calculated via 14 e a k e e p 15 k e θ θ d θ f θ d where k e is the soil stress coefficient for soil evaporation θ d is the minimum water content under the air dying condition l3l 3 and which is set as the residual water content θ r lastly the eq 7 will be solved by substituting the actual soil evaporation and crop transpiration for each layer 2 4 diffusive soil movement driven by matric potential 2 4 1 diffusion equation the diffusion equation eq 4 is discretized using an implicit finite difference method and then solved with the chasing method of householder 2006 the discrete equation in layer i shown in fig 1 in a homogeneous soil column is 16 m i θ i j 1 θ i j δ t d i 1 2 j θ i j 1 θ i 1 j 1 m i 1 2 m i 2 d i 1 2 j θ i 1 j 1 θ i j 1 m i 1 2 m i 2 where subscript i represents the layer number and the superscript j represents the time level mi 1 mi and mi 1 represent the thickness l of the soil layers denoted by indices i 1 i and i 1 respectively d i 1 2 j represents the geometric mean hydraulic diffusivity l2t 1 of layer i 1 and layer i at the time level j and d i 1 2 j represents the geometric mean hydraulic diffusivity l2t 1 of layer i and layer i 1 at the time level j θ i j θ i j 1 represent the soil water content l3 l 3 of layer i at the time levels j and j 1 θ i 1 j 1 θ i 1 j 1 represent the soil water content l3 l 3 of layer i 1 and layer i 1 at the time level j 1 δt is the time step t 2 4 2 simplified expression of hydraulic diffusivity the hydraulic diffusivity of the unsaturated soil is a non linear function that depends on the soil water content soil texture and structure when using the van genuchten model van genuchten 1980 to represent the soil water characteristics the hydraulic diffusivity function is 17 d θ k θ m n α n θ s θ r 1 α h n m 1 h n 1 18 k θ k s s 1 1 s 1 m m 2 19 s θ θ r θ s θ r where h is the pressure head l θ is the soil water content l3 l 3 θ s and θ r are the saturated and residual water content respectively l3 l 3 k θ is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity lt 1 k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity lt 1 s is the effective saturation α l 1 and n are the two empirical parameters m 1 1 n five parameters are needed to evaluate eq 17 and they are θ s θ r k s α and n since parameters α and n are always difficult to obtain zhu et al 2009 sun et al 2015 vereecken et al 2010 we develop an empirical formula of hydraulic diffusivity to reduce the number of needed parameters from 5 to 3 i e ks θ s and θ r parameters α and n are not needed in the empirical formula since the empirical formula has an exponential form and is a straight line in the semi logarithmic coordinate system we can fit the hydraulic diffusivity of different soils by the linear regression method as shown in fig 2 and the exponential function is 20 d θ 10 a s θ b where a and b are the slope and intercept of a fitted straight line s is the effective saturation the soil hydraulic parameters for each soil type refer to carsel and parrish 1988 and carsel et al 1988 which depend on a soil database including approximately 3000 soils obtained from the u s soil conservation service the regression is mainly based on the soil water content ranging from the field capacity to the saturated water content the fitted line is extrapolated to the soil water content that is smaller than the field capacity the fitted hydraulic diffusivity by the simplified model is usually larger than the values calculated by using the van genuchten model when the soil is dry as shown in fig 2 however the hydraulic diffusivity values are between 10 8 m2 d and 10 4 m2 d for different soil types when the soil water content is close to field capacity these small values of hydraulic diffusivity will result in limited the soil water movement the values are even smaller when the soil water content is below the field capacity for which situation the simplified model cannot result in significant deviations we next establish the relationship between the two coefficients a and b and the saturated hydraulic conductivity by using the piecewise fitting method with the combination of a quadratic curve and a straight line as shown in fig 3 the resulting regression equations are 21 a 0 4014 log 10 k s 2 0 5861 log 10 k s 4 518 log 10 k s 0 9 4 8045 log 10 k s 0 7639 log 10 k s 0 9 22 b 0 12 log 10 k s 2 0 511 log 10 k s 4 1381 log 10 k s 0 9 5 2687 log 10 k s 0 2358 log 10 k s 0 9 by following the two steps above the hydraulic diffusivity of a specific soil type can be formulated by the exponential empirical formula without empirical parameters α and n as shown in fig 2 the empirical exponential function can reasonably describe the hydraulic diffusivity with the three physical meaning parameters k s θ s and θ r 2 4 3 calculating correction term for heterogeneous soils soil water content is discontinuous at the material interface when a soil profile is heterogeneous hills et al 1989 khaleel et al 2002 zha et al 2013 matthews et al 2005a 2005b given that soil water content is a function of matric potential and soil hydraulic parameters the vertical variation of θ in the gradational soil can be expressed as 23 θ z θ h h z l 1 n θ p l p l z where p is a vector composed of n parameters pl l 1 2 n of the soil water retention function this equation indicates that the vertical gradient of soil water content consists of two parts the one caused by the vertical variation of h and the other caused by the vertical variation of the parameters substituting eq 23 into eq 4 the diffusive term driven by the matric potential is 24 θ t z d θ θ z l 1 n θ p l p l z there is an extra term l 1 n θ p l p l z on the right side of eq 24 compared to the equation in the homogeneous soil this is a correction term to the gradient of soil water content for describing the soil variation due to heterogeneity when adopting the van genuchten model to represent the soil water characteristics there are four parameters to describe the correction term and they are the saturated water content θ s l3l 3 the residual water content θ r l3l 3 and two empirical parameters n and α l 1 the analytical expressions of the partial derivative of soil water content with respect to each parameter are 25 θ θ s 1 α h n m s 26 θ θ r 1 1 α h n m 1 s 27 θ α mnh θ s θ r 1 α h n m 1 α h n 1 28 θ n θ s θ r s ln s n n 1 n 1 n 2 s n 1 n 1 ln s n 1 n 1 s n 1 n where s is the effective saturation the four terms θ θ s θ θ r θ α and θ n of different soil types are shown in fig 4 the values of θ θ s and θ θ r can be easily calculated by using eqs 25 and 26 when effective saturation is obtained the value of θ α is close to zero which indicates that this item can be ignored in the correction term eq 28 is complicated and requires parameter n since the values of n are not always available a regression formula is developed to characterize the relationship between n with the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s as shown in fig 5 an exponential function is adopted as there is a strong positive correlation between k s and n as a result parameter n can be calculated via 29 n 0 9509 e 0 72223 log 10 k s 0 9 therefore the diffusive term of the heterogeneous soil can be calculated with three parameters which are the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s the saturated water content θ s and the residual water content θ r considering all the three items the advective term source sink term and the diffusive term in our mass balance model only four soil hydraulic parameters are essential to calculate the soil water movement and they are the saturated hydraulic conductivity k s the field capacity θ f the saturated water content θ s and the residual water content θ r these parameters have physical meanings and are easy to be obtained which makes the water balance model more applicable in practice furthermore because of the implicit difference scheme used to discretize the diffusion equation the water balance model is numerically stabile and thus applicable to the simulations with coarse discretization in space and time 3 model evaluation and application the water balance model is first tested by using two published infiltration cases with the homogeneous and heterogeneous soil conditions then three synthetic examples are designed to evaluate the model with different soil types drainage functions and discretization resolutions in space and time the simulation results are compared with those obtained using hydrus 1d šimunek et al 2008 the water balance model is also applied to a real world lysimeter experiment with climate boundary conditions for these cases the mean absolute relative error are and the root mean squared error rmse schoups et al 2006 zha et al 2017 are used to quantitatively evaluate the misfit between the simulated results of the water balance model and hydrus 1d or observed water content are and rmse are calculated as 30 are 1 n i 1 n y i j h i j h i j 100 31 rmse 1 n i 1 n y i j h i j 2 where the subscript i represents the layer number and the superscript j represents the time level y i j is the simulated result of the proposed model and h i t is the observation or the results from hydrus 1d as the comparison standard 3 1 case 1 infiltration cases two published infiltration examples are used to test the performance of the model accuracy the first one is a case with vertical infiltration in homogeneous soil based on the documentation of unsatchem module for hydrus 2d 3d skagges et al 1970 šimůnek et al 2012 the soil column is 0 6 m in length and filled with the sand with the saturated hydraulic conductivity of 0 6238 m d the column is subjected to ponded infiltration at the surface and the bottom boundary is impermeable the second example based on hills et al 1989 has heterogeneous soils with two soil types berino loamy fine sand and glendale clay loam whose saturated hydraulic conductivity are 5 41 m d and 0 131 m d respectively the soil column is 1 m in length with each soil layer being 0 2 m in length the constant infiltration rate is 0 02 m d the detailed information of the two examples can be found in references skagges et al 1970 šimůnek et al 2012 hills et al 1989 the water balance model is used to simulate the water content profiles under the two conditions and the simulated results are compared with those from references as shown in fig 6 for the homogeneous example the are values for the two profiles at times 3600 s and 7200 s fig 6 a and b are 22 and 12 and the rmse values are 0 088 cm3 cm3 and 0 044 cm3 cm3 the percentage error of the mass balance is 3 10 6 for the water balance model for the second heterogeneous example the are values for the two profiles at times 1d and 5d fig 6 c and d are 6 6 and 13 6 and the rmse values are 0 025 cm3 cm3 and 0 045 cm3 cm3 the percentage error of the mass balance is 5 10 6 for the water balance model the comparison results of the two examples show that the water balance model can capture the characteristic of the infiltration process and keep water balance well both for the homogeneous and heterogeneous soils 3 2 case 2 soil water movement driven by matric potential with various soil types in this numerical example the developed water balance model is used to simulate the soil water movement driven by the matric potential and the main purpose is to evaluate the accuracy of the simplified method for describing the diffusive term as shown in section 2 4 2 the soil column is 2 m in length and the profile is homogeneous with both the top and bottom boundaries being impermeable the initial soil water content of the top half profile is set as 0 15 and the bottom half profile as 0 35 eight types of soils with the soil hydraulic parameters and the field capacity given by carsel and parrish 1988 and ratliff et al 1983 are listed in table 2 the linear drainage function is used in the water balance model the spatial discretization resolution of hydrus 1d and the water balance model are both 2 cm and the time step of the water balance model is a constant value of 0 5 day which is close to the mean time step of hydrus 1d the water balance model is used to simulate the water movement and the simulated soil water content profiles for the different soil types at the 30th day are compared with those of hydrus 1d as shown in fig 7 the soil water content in the top half profile increases over time the increased soil water content is driven by the matric potential since the water movement under gravitational potential is downward the good match of the soil water content in the top half profile of the two models indicates that the water balance model can calculate the upward flow satisfactorily especially for loam and clay we list the are values and the rmse values of the profiles in table 3 the are values are less than 11 and the rmse values are less than 0 05 cm3 cm3 which indicate that the simplify method of diffusivity can reasonably simulate the upward flow driven by matric potential fig 7 shows that there is relative poor performance in the bottom half profile where the soil water content near the saturated water content for loam silty loam and clay loam soils the reason is that in the bottom half profile the gravitational potential and the matric potential simultaneously drive the soil movement as the soil water content in this region exceeds the field capacity whereas the water balance model considers the two forces separately first calculating the downward flow driven by the gravitational potential and then calculating the upward flow driven by the matric potential in other words the model may overestimate the upward flux near the water table which leads to an underestimation of soil water content below water table and an overestimation of soil water content above water table generally speaking this numerical example indicates that the simplify method of diffusivity can reasonably simulate the upward flux driven by the matric potential despite that the water balance model may overestimate the upward flux near a water table furthermore the average simulation time of hydrus 1d is 0 22 s larger than that for the water balance model table 3 which indicates that the water balance model is 3 to 10 times faster than hydrus 1d the percentage error of mass balance is in the order of magnitude of 10 4 for hydrus 1d but 10 7 for the water balance model these indicate that the water balance model is more efficient with better water balance 3 3 case 3 soil water movement with complicated boundary and estimation of drainage functions this numerical example is to evaluate the performance of the water balance model under complex boundary conditions such as under the variable atmospheric boundary condition the numerical example also evaluates the performance of the water balance model for the drainage functions listed in table 1 the soil column of this example is 2 m in length there is no crop on the top boundary and the bottom boundary is impermeable fig 8 shows the top boundary condition including the daily precipitation and the soil evaporation the annual precipitation is 650 mm and the annual soil evaporation is 756 mm the initial water table is in the depth of 0 48 m and the soil water content changes linearly from 0 2 at the surface to saturation at the water table the soil is loam with the soil hydraulic parameters and the field capacity listed in table 2 the spatial discretization of hydrus 1d and the water balance model are both 2 cm and the time step of the water balance model is 0 1 day which is close to the mean time step of hydrus 1d the soil water content profiles at different times of the water balance model with the 5 drainage functions are compared with those of hydrus 1d as shown in fig 9 the results show that the water balance model can simulate the vertical flow satisfactorily the mean rmse values and are values of the 5 drainage functions are listed in table 4 all the rmse values are less than 0 02 m3 m3 and the are values are less than 4 which indicate a good performance of the water balance model specifically speaking the exponential power and square drainage functions have lower rmse values and are values than the other functions the mean soil water content at the depth of 0 10 cm between the water balance model with 5 drainage functions and hydrus 1d are compared in fig 10 the domain volume is used as the weight to average the water content of nodes within the depth of 0 10 cm to obtain the mean water content of hydrus 1d it shows that the water content calculated by the water balance model has the similar trend with those obtained using hydrus 1d but fluctuates more abruptly when the infiltration water or evapotranspiration is directly added to or subtracted from each soil layer while the soil water content in hydrus 1d changes more smoothly the calculated mean soil water content at the depth of 0 10 cm by the water balance model are smaller than the values calculated by hydrus 1d during the first 50 days this difference is attributed to the use of the drainage function when the soil water content ranges from the field capacity θ f to the saturated water content θ s in the water balance model fig 11 shows the relationship between soil water content and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of the van genuchten model and the 5 drainage functions the water balance model has larger unsaturated hydraulic conductivities calculated by the 5 drainage functions when the soil water content exceeds the layer s field capacity as a result the water balance model may overestimate the infiltration when the infiltration is more than the evapotranspiration during the first 50 days and gives smaller soil water content in the top layer during the period from the 200th day to the 300th day the surface soil water content fluctuates more drastically as the influence of the top boundary fig 10 the exponential drainage function overestimates the soil water content while the linear and exponential approximation drainage functions underestimate the soil water content the power and square drainage functions give more accurate results a comprehensive consideration of the performance of each drainage function leads to the conclusion that for the water balance model the power drainage function and square function are recommended due to their satisfactory performance in terms of rmse values and are values and the smaller number of parameters the simulation times of hydrus 1d and the water balance model are 3 5 s and 2 s respectively which indicates that the water balance model is almost 2 times faster than hydrus 1d the percentage error of the mass balance is in the order of magnitude of 10 3 for hydrus 1d but10 4 for the water balance model in general the water balance model is effective and efficient for simulating the water movement in the unsaturated zone under complex top boundary conditions the square function and the power function are chosen as the recommend drainage functions 3 4 case 4 soil water movement in heterogeneous soils with various spatial discretization and time steps in this example heterogeneous soils with complicated boundary conditions are considered to evaluate the performance of the water balance model with different discretization resolutions in space and time the soil column is 2 m in length filled with alternating layers of two types of soil each layer being 0 4 m thick the two soil types are sandy loam and silt loam and the filling starts with silt loam in the first layer the soil hydraulic parameters and field capacity are listed in table 2 the top boundary is the atmospheric boundary and the bottom boundary is impermeable fig 12 plots the daily precipitation and soil evaporation of the top boundary the annual precipitation is 650 mm and the annual soil evaporation is 672 01 mm the initial soil water content is uniform with the value of 0 25 the square drainage function is used in the water balance model in order to evaluate the model applicability to various spatial discretization and time steps under the heterogeneous soil eight modeling scenarios with the spatial discretization and time steps 10 cm 1 h 10 cm 1d 20 cm 1 h 20 cm 1d 20 cm 2d 20 cm 5d 20 cm 10d and 20 cm 15d are used by the water balance model the hydrus 1d model with spatial resolution of 2 cm are adopted as a reference the simulated soil water content profiles of the eight scenarios are compared with those from hydrus 1d as shown in fig 13 the rmse values are values and mass balance errors are listed in table 5 all the scenarios can simulate mass balance well with the percentage mass balance error as being 10 5 or less the first five scenarios obtain very similar results with satisfactory performance in the first third and fifth soil layers as the rmse values are less than 0 041 cm3 cm3 and are values less than 10 4 the are values of the second and the fourth layers increase significantly it is caused by the smaller value of soil water content in the two layers of sandy loam which has smaller water holding capacity and soil water content however the rmse values of the second and the fourth layers are close to 0 04 cm3 cm3 which indicate an acceptable result when we keep the spatial step at 20 cm and increase the time step from 2d 5d 10d to 15d the rmse values and are values become worse especially for the top layers the result of the scenario with the time step of 5d is acceptable however when the time step increases to 10d or 15d the mean are value over the five layers is more than 20 and the mean rmse value over the five layers is close to 0 05 cm3 cm3 which indicates that the results of simulated soil water content are not acceptable the reason is that for a small time step the amount of infiltration is small and limited to the top layers only this water can be removed from the soil layers by evapotranspiration and thus does not reach deeper layers quickly this is similar to what happens in the real case however when the time step is large the amount of infiltration becomes large enough to reach deeper soil layers before the infiltration water is removed by evapotranspiration which leads to smaller soil water content at top layers but larger soil content in deeper layers therefore the simulated soil water content with a large time step are unacceptable generally speaking when the time steps are less than 5 days there will be a proper accuracy of the soil water content furthermore it is found that for the water balance model the accuracy of is similar for all the first five scenarios which indicates that the water balance model yields satisfactory results even for the scenarios with large spatial discretization and time steps under heterogeneous soil conditions with complicated boundary conditions 3 5 case 5 real world application to lysimeter experiment the lysimeter experiment was conducted from november 2003 to june 2004 during the growing season of winter wheat in irrigation and drainage experiment station at wuhan university china wang 2007 zhu et al 2009 2017 the size of the lysimeter is 2 m 2 m 3 m the evapotranspiration was not directly measured and a value of 75 percent of annual mean water requirement of the crop growth is used in this simulation the crop transpiration rate over the soil evaporation rate is assumed to be 3 1 during the crop growing season fig 14 plots the precipitation irrigation rate the crop transpiration rate and the soil evaporation rate the bottom boundary is set as the free drainage condition the soil hydraulic parameters of the lysimeter experiment used in the water balance model are listed in table 6 the time step is 1 h and the spatial step is 10 cm in the water balance model the simulated cumulative evaporation and transpiration are 94 2 mm and 282 7 mm respectively and the simulated flux at the bottom of the lysimeter is 73 7 mm the percentage error of the mass balance for the water balance model is in the order of magnitude of 10 4 fig 15 shows the comparison of simulated and observed soil water content at different times the rmse values of each profile are 0 008 cm3 cm3 0 021 cm3 cm3 0 013 cm3 cm3 and 0 014 cm3 cm3 respectively and the are values are 2 1 6 5 3 1 and 4 7 respectively which indicate a good performance of the water balance model fig 16 shows the comparison of the simulated and observed soil water content over time at different observation layers the soil water content at the depth of 0 1 m fluctuates drastically due to the influence of the top boundary condition the water balance model has a good fit with the observed data except during the time between the 80th day and the 130th day the reason is that the evaporation and transpiration of the top boundary may insufficient to reduce the top soil water content since the mean seasonal value is used at the depth of 0 7 m the water balance model has a good performance while at the depth of 1 3 m and 1 7 m the water balance model shows sharp increases of the water content and this is caused by the assumption that the infiltration water is allocated instantaneously after irrigation or precipitation overall the performance of the water balance model is satisfactorily when using different spatial discretization resolution and time steps the observed soil water content and the simulated results of hydrus 1d and the water balance model over time at different layers are compared in fig 16 the percentage error of the mass balance the mean rmse values the mean are values and the computational costs of the water balance model and hydrus 1d are shown in table 7 when the time step increases from 1 h to 1d and the spatial discretization increases from 10 cm to 20 cm the proposed model can still simulate the observations well the are and rmse do not show worse trend the model also can simulate mass balance well with the percentage error of the mass balance remained as 10 5 the results indicate that the water balance model is suitable for the large spatial discretization and time steps this however is not the case for hydrus 1d while hydrus 1d has good results at the time step of 1 h and spatial discretization of 10 cm the simulation results deteriorate with the increased spatial discretization and time steps the hydrus 1d results are unreasonable in that the soil becomes saturated after the 130th day when the time step of 1 d and spatial discretization of 20 cm which is caused by the intensive irrigation that leads to an iterative error additionally the water balance model is more effective than hydrus 1d as shown in table 7 and the simulation times indicate the computation efficiency of the water balance model is 2 to 4 times faster as a summary the results shown in figs 15 and 16 indicate that the simulated soil water content of the water balance model has a satisfactory agreement with the observed data and the water balance model can be used for coarse spatial discretization and large time steps 4 conclusions this study develops a one dimensional water balance model with physically meaningful parameters for simulating vertical water movement in unsaturated soils the model can effectively and efficiently capture the features of soil water movement the model is evaluated by using both synthetic numerical examples and real world experimental data the major conclusions drawn from this research are as follows 1 the water balance model can simulate both upward and downward flow in the unsaturated zone by considering the advective term driven by the gravitational potential the source sink term and the diffusive term driven by the matric potential individually the model yields satisfactory mass balance even for coarse spatial discretization and large time step which greatly improves the efficiency and applicability of the model 2 when solving the advective soil movement the water balance model is compatible with various drainage functions used to describe the relationship between unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and soil water content the square drainage function and the power drainage function are superior to other functions due to their satisfactory performance and with no empirical parameters 3 a new empirical formula is developed to calculate the diffusivity with three parameters the saturated hydraulic conductivity the saturated water content and the residual water content when solving the diffusive soil movement in the heterogeneous soil a correction term is used and evaluated using the simplified function with the three parameters above 4 applying the water balance model to simulation soil water movement in the unsaturated zone demonstrates the accommodation of the model to the upward flow complex boundary conditions and soil heterogeneity conditions 5 the water balance model may overestimate the upward flux close to water table due to the equations for advective flow source sink term and diffusive flow solved separately acknowledgments the study was partially supported by the national key research and development program of china 2016yfc0501304 and natural science
