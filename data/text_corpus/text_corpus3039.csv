15195,large anthropogenic inputs of n and p alter the nutrient cycle and exacerbate global eutrophication problems in aquatic ecosystems this study in lake datong china investigates the remediation mechanism of multiple remediation technique combinations dredging adsorbent amendment and planting aquatic vegetation on sediment n and p loads based on two high resolution sampling techniques hr peeper and dgt and p sequential extraction procedures the results showed that high temperature and low dissolved oxygen considerably enhanced pore water dissolved reactive p drp and nh4 concentrations attributable to abundant fe p and organic matter content in the sediment fe reduction is critical for regulating pore water drp release and promoting n removal overall for lake datong combining multiple remediation techniques is more effective in controlling sediment p loads pore water drp p fluxes forms of p and labile p from a long term perspective than a single remediation lanthanum modified bentonite lmb inactivation treatment can transfer mobile p in the surface sediment into more refractory forms over time thereby reducing the risk of sediment labile p release however it is difficult to effectively remediate internal p loads owing to inappropriate dredging depths and low biomass of aquatic vegetation future lake restoration practices should optimize the selection of different remediation technique combinations based on internal n and p pollution characteristics while reducing external wastewater input these results are important for understanding the remediation mechanisms of internal n and p and provide suggestions for sediment management of shallow eutrophic lakes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords remediation mechanism internal loading

e g intensive aquaculture have become one of the most severe global environmental pollution problems over the past decade conley et al 2009 huang et al 2020 hou et al 2022 curbing lake eutrophication through the dual control of n and p inputs is of great interest to limnologists conley et al 2009 paerl et al 2016 zhou et al 2022a even after external nutrient inputs are effectively controlled nutrients stored in internal sediments are continuously released to support high phytoplankton populations especially in shallow eutrophic lakes søndergaard et al 2013 qin et al 2020 zhou et al 2022b the faster accumulation and greater retention of p than n in global lakes under anthropogenic influences potentially causes algal blooms and biodiversity losses yan et al 2016 wu et al 2022 internal regenerated nh4 and mobile p release in eutrophic lakes play increasingly important roles in sustaining cyanobacterial blooms rydin 2000 xue et al 2021 liu et al 2022 the release intensity of n and p from internal sediments is not only related to the amount of nutrients stored but also closely related to the forms of n and p in sediments and changes in external environmental factors li et al 2021 liu et al 2022 previous studies have found that sediments in different areas of eutrophic lakes often show different spatial distribution characteristics of p fractions and organic matter om due to soil erosion external wastewater input and pollutant history for example the fe p p bound to fe oxides and hydroxides and om content were higher in the algae and river mouth distribution areas while the ca p calcium bound p content was higher in aquatic plant distribution areas in the eutrophic lakes chaohu and taihu china liu et al 2019 yang et al 2020 yin et al 2022 fe p the main potentially mobile p component is easily released into the overlying water by increasing the temperature and decreasing dissolved oxygen do søndergaard et al 2013 liu et al 2018 ni et al 2020 furthermore the enhancement of the metabolic activity of ammonifiers due to warming can promote nh4 regeneration rates and accelerate the decomposition of om e g algal debris and do exhaustion all of which boost the release of nh4 from internal sediments amorim and moura 2021 xue et al 2021 the dual control of regeneration and release of internal n and p is critical for the management of lake eutrophication previously many studies have used lanthanum modified zeolites to simultaneously reduce the release of internal n and p from sediment by increasing the ability to fix p and improve do levels li et al 2019 wei et al 2022 however combining multiple remediation techniques dredging adsorbent amendment and planting aquatic vegetation has not been conducted for the in situ remediation of n and p contaminated sediments in shallow eutrophic lakes several lake remediation techniques have been widely applied in recent decades such as physical restoration and sediment dredging chemical restoration and in situ adsorbent amendment and bioremediation and aquatic vegetation reconstruction to control internal nutrient loads in eutrophic lakes sediment dredging is frequently used to remove n and p contaminated sediments from shallow eutrophic lakes however some field studies have shown that dredging for long term restoration effects is challenging to maintain liu et al 2016 jing et al 2019 our previous research found that two years after dredging in lake datong a typical shallow eutrophic aquacultural lake with the redeposition of bioavailable p fe p and organic p op the effectiveness of dredging weakened which in turn increased the risk of p release from sediments li et al 2020 in situ adsorbent amendment can quickly remove dissolved reactive p drp in the overlying water by adding p adsorbent materials such as iron aluminum and calcium salts especially lanthanum modified bentonite lmb this increases the ability of sediment to adsorb p thereby reducing sediment p release and rapidly improving water quality meis et al 2013 lürling et al 2016 however in shallow eutrophic lakes the surface sediments are easily disturbed causing them to be resuspended and thus covering p adsorbent materials after redeposition and reducing the restoration efficiency of these materials wang et al 2022 our previous study found that after the first year of aquatic vegetation restoration in lake datong the content of dissolved p in the overlying water and sediment ca p of the whole lake halved li et al 2021 however we also found that in the second year after the restoration of lake datong the aquatic vegetation cover decreased because the water level in summer and the nh4 and p concentrations in the overlying water increased considerably and the dominant species of planktonic algae changed from bacillariophyta to cyanobacteria chao et al 2022 therefore planting aquatic vegetation alone may not be an ideal measure because of its susceptibility to extreme environmental conditions and combining multiple remediation measures may be more effective in improving long term water quality in shallow lakes bai et al 2020 found that after six years of aquatic vegetation reconstruction through the addition of 10 cm thick modified bentonite to the sediments of the west lake restoration area in hangzhou the water quality notably improved with a gradual increase in the submerged vegetation community however the remediation mechanism of internal n and p combined with multiple remediation techniques remains unclear lake datong is a typical shallow eutrophic p contaminated lake located in the middle reaches of the yangtze river our previous investigation found that after more than a decade of intensive aquaculture the average tp and tn sediment content exceeded 2000 mg kg in 2017 the characteristics of sediment pollution in the lake center lc and lake shore ls of lake datong are typically different therefore lake datong is an ideal research area for restoring sediment n and p pollution by combining multiple remediation techniques in shallow lakes here we selected typical lc and ls sediments in lake datong to explore the ability of the in situ remediation mechanism of combining multiple lake remediation techniques dredging adsorbent amendment and planting aquatic vegetation to control internal n and p regeneration and release via a long term field sediment core experiment the results of this study provide theoretical support for the optimal selection of eutrophic lake remediation techniques and a scientific basis for the precise control of n and p in shallow eutrophic lakes 2 material and method 2 1 materials intact sediment cores 500 90 mm length diameter representing two typical types of sediment pollution were obtained from the ls 29 18 n 112 46 e and lc 29 22 n 112 54 e in lake datong using a sediment core sampler in april 2021 the sampling areas in the lc and ls were located in a historically intensive aquaculture area and near the river mouth of the wuqi canal a large source of input for external effluents a total of 260 sediment cores were randomly collected from the lc and ls for the experiments approximately 500 m2 per sampling site after carefully transferring the sediment cores to the laboratory they were laterally sliced at 1 cm intervals sediment samples from the same depth were sieved 40 mesh mixed evenly and carefully backfilled into the sediment cores manually to remove dead benthic snails mussel shell debris and historically deposited small amounts of undecomposed aquatic plant debris from deep sediments 15 cm depth to reduce experimental errors caused by micro topographic differences except for the removal of dead zoobenthos and plant debris from the surface and deep sediments the experimental sediment cores obtained were consistent with the intact sediment cores each sediment core consisted of 25 cm of sediment and filtered lake water lmb phoslock was purchased from a branch of the phoslock company in china seedlings of vallisneria natans height 5 5 0 5 cm root length 2 1 cm were cultivated with in situ lake water and sediments for the experiment the diffusive gradients in thin films dgt technique and a high resolution dialysis sampler hr peeper were employed to simultaneously measure sediment labile p and pore water drp fe2 and nh4 concentrations at the millimeter scale 2 2 experimental design we randomly screened 120 sediment cores from the lc and ls and a total of 15 sediment cores were used for each of the eight treatments fig 1 1 control a

average depth of the p pollution layer in the surface sediments of lake datong was approximately 7 cm 3 lmb c c sediment cores with lmb added in a ratio of 100 1 based on the mass of mobile p

refers to the current situation of a low density of v natans in lake datong in the past three years 80 plants m2 5 dred lmb e e followed the sequence of first simulating dredging and then adding lmb the simulated dredging depth and lmb addition amount were the same as those described above 6 dred v natans f f followed the sequence of first simulating dredging and then planting v natans 7 lmb v

moreover we divided the eight experimental treatment groups into no lmb treatment control dred v natans dred v natans and lmb inactivation lmb dred lmb lmb v natans dred lmb v natans to avoid the sedimentation of suspended particles in the sediment cores the tops of all sediment core plexiglass tubes were covered with nylon mesh size 250 and all mesh bags were periodically replaced throughout the experiment the sediment cores were then placed in stainless steel frames prepared in advance and fixed on the experimental platform 29 20 n 112 56 e at the bottom of the lake to simulate the actual changes in the lake water environment fig s1 during the experiment a temperature and light recording device hobo onset computer corporation bourne ma usa was used to automatically record the water temperature and light changes at the bottom of the lake every hour the sediment cores were retrieved on day 15 may 2021 45 june 2021 90 august 2021 150 october 2021 and 240 january 2022 at each sampling time 48 sediment cores were collected three independent replicates for each treatment and used to measure pore water drp fe2 and nh4 concentrations sediment cores were collected on days 15 90 and 240 to measure differences in the vertical distribution of sediment p fractions and om content the do of the overlying water was measured using a portable do meter hq1130 hach usa three overlying water samples from each treatment were collected and immediately analyzed for tp at the end of the experiment an analysis was undertaken of the bacterial community composition in sediments and dgt to measure the two dimensional distribution of sediment labile p 2 3 chemical analysis tp in water samples was analyzed using the standard test methods chinese epa 2002 p fractions in sediments were

using a uv 1800 spectrophotometer shimadzu company japan the retrieved dgt and hr peeper probes were handled according to the methods described in the supplementary material of li et al 2020 sediment om content was quantified by the loss on ignition method loi at 550 c for 6 h farmer et al 2014 in the last sampling approximately 2 0 g of surface sediment 0 2 cm samples per treatment were collected for the composition of microbial community analysis detailed information on sequencing and data analysis refer to our previous research methods yu et al 2021 2 4 statistical analysis the data plots and statistical analyses were produced using origin 2019 originlab northampton ma usa we used pearson s correlation analysis to determine the correlations between pore water drp nh4 and fe2 in sediments for data quality control we analyzed three independent replicates of the sediment p fractions loi drp fe2 and nh4 concentration and the average values were used for the data analysis significant differences in variables p fractions p flux loi pore water drp fe2 and nh4 concentration among treatments were identified through one way analysis of variance anova followed by tukey s test significance was set at the p 0 05 levels 3 results and discussion 3 1 sediment properties the sediment properties used in this study between lc and ls in lake datong are presented in table s1 the average tp of the lc and ls surface sediments were 1158 and 1184 mg kg respectively and tn concentrations were 3020 and 2975 mg kg respectively moreover ca p was the main p fraction in lake datong and the fraction of sediment ca p in the lc was significantly higher than that in the ls p 0 003 the ca p content of the lc and ls accounted for 50 8 and 43 7 of tp respectively conversely the fe p content in the ls was significantly higher than that in the lc p 0 001 the fe p content of the ls and lc accounted for 33 5 and 26 8 of tp respectively although mobile p is a potentially bioavailable p source for algae in the lc and ls accounting for 30 0 and 36 5 of the sediment tp respectively yin et al 2022 fe p accounts for 89 3 and 91 7 of the sediment mobile p content respectively industrial and domestic effluent have been proven to increase sediment fe p ni et al 2020 the wuqi canal a primary source of imported agricultural and domestic effluent in the lake datong basin occupies a large proportion of the external n and p inputs resulting in a relatively high fe p content deposited in the ls additionally the higher ca p in the lc may be primarily related to historically intensive aquaculture which involves the application of large amounts of inorganic and organic fertilizers mainly calcium superphosphate and chicken manure there are 38 canals or rivers densely distributed along the shore of lake datong and intensive aquaculture has been conducted for more than ten years in the lake center therefore the sediments of the two sampling sites in this study represent two typical pollution types in lake datong 3 2 effects of multiple remediation techniques on pore water drp fe2 and nh4 we observed that different experimental treatments profoundly influenced the pore water drp concentration variation in surface sediments 0 30 mm depth fig 2 and table 1 previous research has shown that the active layer of p is concentrated at the sediment water interface swi and sediments act as a p source during algal blooms the peak shape distributions of pore water drp profiles are related to the depth of the oxide layer and sediment p properties wang et al 2015 yao et al 2016 compared with the control group we observed that dredging alone 70 mm depth reduced the pore water drp concentration of the surface sediments in august day 90 in the lc p 0 001 and ls except for october day 150 p 0 016 table 1 the difference in dredging effectiveness between lc and ls may be related to decreased sediment om content p fractions and the improvement of redox conditions after dredging sinsabaugh et al 2008 jing et al 2013 compared to the control group dredging reduced the loi of surface sediments 0 30 mm depth in the lc and ls from 7 0 0 7 and 7 4 0 8 to 6 0 1 6 and 5 4 2 2 respectively fig s2 simultaneously we observed that the mobile p concentration of surface sediments 0 30 mm depth in the lc and ls increased significantly from 334 3 12 2 to 390 4 15 4 mg kg p 0 008 and decreased drastically from 355 4 41 1 to 145 3 11 2 mg kg p 0 002 after dredging alone respectively table s2 our results indicated that compared with the lc dredging to 7 cm depth has a greater effect on the removal of pore water drp concentration in the ls notably our earlier study found that dredging to 110 cm in the lc of lake datong reduced ca p and om surface sediment concentrations and drp diffusion flux in summer meanwhile deeper dredging depths in the lc easily lead to the redeposition of bioavailable p e g fe p and op after two years of dredging increasing the risk of internal p release li et al 2020 however this study showed that dredging alone to 7 cm in the ls can effectively reduce the p diffusion flux fig 5 whereas the ineffectiveness in the lc increased the mobile p concentration of the surface sediments fig 6 and table s2 therefore the depth and scope of dredging should be determined according to the degree of p enrichment in the surface sediments of the different lake areas moreover we observed that the addition of lmb alone cloud significantly reduce the pore water drp concentration of the surface sediments in the lc except in january day 240 p 0 001 and ls p 0 019 previous studies have shown that adding lmb can quickly and efficiently remove drp from the water column by the formation of the stable mineral rhabdophane lapo4 nh2o while intercepting and adsorbing drp released from bottom sediments copetti et al 2016 lürling et al 2016 our results were consistent with these results showing that adding lmb can effectively reduce the surface sediment pore water drp concentration compared to dredging yin et al 2021 however compared to the control group we found that planting low density v natans alone was less effective in removing pore water drp concentrations furthermore we found that multiple remediation technique combinations especially lmb inactivation groups could effectively reduce the pore water drp concentration of surface sediments p 0 002 compared with the control group and a single remediation technique except for the dred v natans group in the lc in august day 90 and the lc and ls in january day 240 table 1 our results show that lmb inactivation treatments single and multiple remediation techniques can markedly reduce the pore water drp concentration in surface sediments from a long term restoration perspective and for practical application implications our results suggest that a combination of dredging at the appropriate depth by removing internal contaminants e g om and p fractions and lmb addition through adsorbing drp may have an additive effect on reducing pore water drp concentrations in lake areas with high sediment p pollution we observed that the pore water fe2 concentration in the sediment was considerably greater during the warmer seasons from june to october fig 3 simultaneously compared with the control group other remediation methods except planting v natans alone significantly reduced the pore water fe2 concentration of surface sediments 0 30 mm depth in the lc p 0 033 and ls p 0 001 in summer but had no significant effect in winter moreover we observed a stronger positive correlation between pore water fe2 and drp across five months for the eight treatment groups between the lc and ls fig s4 s8 our results suggest that fe redox cycling plays a vital role in regulating the release of internal p from the lc and ls here fe p accounted for approximately 90 of the sediment mobile p content between the lc and ls table s1 meanwhile we found that the do concentration in the water column of the sediment cores in summer was significantly lower than that in winter p 0 001 fig s3 b and b in the shallow lake datong especially the rising temperatures in summer accelerated the decomposition of om e g algal and aquatic plant debris while consuming a large amount of oxygen and boosting the microbial reduction of p hosted fe oxyhydr oxide resulting in a massive release of fe p liu et al 2018 wang et al 2019 except for in winter we found that the pore water fe2 concentration of the surface sediments 0 30 mm depth of the control group in the lc was significantly higher than that in the ls 2 7 times p 0 032 fig 3 a and a probably related to the higher residual om due to long term aquaculture fertilization in the lc huang et al 2020 yogev et al 2020 our results indicate that temperature do and om content strongly affect the pore water fe2 sediment concentration therefore to minimize the release of internal p future lake remediation measures should focus on removing fe p and om content and improving the redox conditions of surface sediments e g planting perennial aquatic plants with developed roots and a strong oxygen secretion capacity especially in the lc in summer we also observed that the pore water nh4 concentration in the lc was significantly higher than that in the ls across all five months for all eight treatment groups p 0 001 fig 4 earlier studies have found that rapid internal nh4 regeneration rates may strongly support the persistence of cyanobacterial blooms andersen et al 2019 xue et al 2021 therefore future research should investigate the relationship between the regeneration of internal nh4 and algal blooms especially in the lc although the difference in pore water nh4 concentrations between different treatment groups in the same sampling period was not very obvious we found that the concentration of pore water nh4 in may day 15 except for groups c and f and in august day 90 in the lc p 0 008 and in may and august except for group h in the ls p 0 05 were significantly higher than those in january day 240 earlier research has suggested that temperature and do play critical roles in regulating the accumulation and release of pore water nh4 in shallow lakes zhong et al 2021 sun et al 2022 particularly during late spring and summer rising temperatures promote algal blooms enhance microbial activity and accelerate the decomposition of om and do exhaustion thereby promoting the accumulation and release of pore water nh4 xue et al 2021 sun et al 2022 furthermore previous findings suggest that continued deposition of external suspended particulate matter absorbing large amounts of water soluble om in the river mouth substantially increases the concentration and diffusion flux of sediment nh4 due to the decomposition of fresh om liu et al 2019 zhong et al 2021 as the sampling area in the ls is located near the mouth of the wuqi canal frequent external water soluble om input and abundant emergent plant debris trapa bispinosa nelumbo nucifera etc result in the deposition of om in the surface sediments correspondingly the higher pore water nh4 concentration in the lc is likely related to the high density application of organic fertilizers mainly chicken manure in the past decade previous research has shown that the changes in om quantity largely depend on the grain size of sediments with higher sediment om quantity in fine sediments yan et al 2022 this was consistent with our observation that there was a higher surface area and adsorption sites of clay fine particle size in the lc than in the silt in the ls additionally we found a stronger positive correlation between pore water nh4 and fe2 across all five months for all eight treatment groups p 0 001 fig s9 s13 previous research has shown that anaerobic ammonium oxidation coupled with ferric iron reduction termed feammox plays a vital role in wetland nitrogen removal li et al 2015 notably high concentrations of om lead to the formation of fe iii oxides in sediments affecting the abundance of functional microorganisms related to nitrogen cycling and promoting the feammox reaction li et al 2015 xiong et al 2022 moreover we found that proteobacteria chloroflexi and nitrospirota were the three most abundant phyla in sediments between lc and ls in winter fig s14 playing a crucial role in decomposing sediment om and promoting n fe and p cycling chaudhry et al 2012 shu et al 2016 fan et al 2018 our earlier findings also suggested that the dominant microbial species except cyanobacteria in sediments in summer were similar to those in winter chao et al 2021 moreover recent studies have found that proteobacteria are positively correlated with sediment ca p playing an important role in sediment p immobilization yin et al 2022 our results further suggest that fe plays an essential role in regulating internal n cycling temperature do and om content have a powerful effect on the pore water nh4 concentration in sediments 3 3 effects of multiple remediation techniques on p flux we observed that the p diffusion flux between lc and ls of the control group in the warm season was significantly higher than that in winter p 0 001 fig 5 high temperatures especially in summer had a more notable impact on the p diffusion flux in the ls possibly related to the high fe p and om content in the ls visser et al 2016 as we observed fe p accounted for approximately 90 of the mobile p content in lake datong where the high temperature and low do concentration in summer enhanced the release of sediment fe p fig 5 and s3 simultaneously we observed inconsistent responses of p diffusion fluxes in the lc and ls to the different experimental treatments dredging alone could effectively reduce the p diffusion flux in the ls except in winter p 0 001 but it did not affect the lc furthermore the negative remediation effect was observed in the dred v natans group in the lc and the reason for this phenomenon is probably related to the deeper p enrichment in the lc fig 6 additionally we found that the inhibition of internal p release by planting v natans alone was lower than that in the control group this was inconsistent with our previous results which showed that submerged vegetation growth can effectively inhibit internal p release li et al 2021 this discrepancy is likely related to the low v natans biomass fresh weight per unit area 467 g m2 in this study while the average biomass fresh weight and density were 2873 g m2 and 282 plants m2 respectively in october 2018 when the v natans community coverage reached 100 in lake datong low coverage and low biomass per unit area of submerged vegetation did not effectively inhibit the release of sediment p compared with the no lmb treatment group we found that the lmb inactivation treatment significantly reduced the p diffusion flux at the swi across all five months between the lc and ls p 0 001 previous studies have shown that the addition of lmb can effectively inhibit the release of internal p by providing a barrier to intercept internal p loading and increasing the mass of p strongly bound in the sediment the more refractory apatite bound p fraction meis et al 2013 mucci et al 2020 our results suggest that combining lmb inactivation with other remediation techniques is more effective for controlling internal p release 3 4 effects of multiple remediation techniques on sediment p properties the mobile p content of the sediments decreased with depth in the ls control group in contrast the difference in the mobile p content between the surface and deeper sediments in the lc showed a consistent distribution pattern fig 6 simultaneously we observed that the mobile p content of surface sediments 0 100 mm depth in the lc and ls increased significantly from 326 1 12 6 to 449 1 66 9 mg kg p 0 001 and decreased from 265 9 84 7 to 135 0 13 2 mg kg p 0 001 after dredging alone respectively fig 6 and table s3 our results further showed that the sediment mobile p enrichment in the high density aquaculture area in the lc more than 7 cm deep and inappropriate dredging depth conversely increased the risk of sediment mobile p release previous studies have shown that mobile p is easily released into overlying water with changes in environmental conditions such as temperature and do ni et al 2020 yang et al 2022 consequently for the high density aquaculture area in the lc priority should be given to adopting a deeper dredging depth to remove the mobile p content and reduce the long term release risk of internal p moreover we observed that the ca p content of the sediment gradually increased from day 15 to the 240 after the addition of lmb fig 6 c c e e g g and h h our findings are consistent with earlier results showing that the application of lmb can transfer mobile p into the more refractory p fraction over time thereby reducing the risk of internal p release meis et al 2013 yin et al 2021 moreover we observed a downward migration process of lmb in groups c c and g g with time whereas groups e e and h h did not show this migration trend previous studies have shown that lmb can migrate down via bioturbation e g chironomids meysman et al 2006 reitzel et al 2013 many chironomids appeared in the upper sediments of groups c c and g g on day 15 and the deeper sediments were transported to the surface layer by animal disturbance over time however there is no apparent downward migration trend of lmb in groups e e and h h probably because dredging removes the chironomids living in the surface sediments and the more rigid sediment layer after dredging is not conducive to the survival of chironomids although we observed healthy growth of v natans throughout the experimental period we did not observe an effect of planting v natans alone on different p fractions in the sediments compared with the control group this was inconsistent with our previous findings in lake datong where the growth of v natans effectively reduced the different forms of p in sediments especially ca p li et al 2021 the difference was probably related to the low community density of v natans making it difficult for low aquatic vegetation biomass to effectively absorb large amounts of p from the sediment 3 5 effects of multiple remediation techniques on sediment labile p to further explore the long term control effects of different remediation techniques on internal p loads the two dimensional sediment distribution of labile p was measured using a high resolution dgt method at the end of the experiment fig 7 we observed that labile p content in the deeper sedimentary layer 40 to 100 mm depth in the lc was significantly higher than that in the ls further indicating that the sediments in the lc have a greater potential for the release of internal labile p meanwhile compared with the control group dredging increased the concentration of labile p in the deep sediments of the lc and decreased the concentration of labile p in the ls fig 7 b b and e e moreover we found that the labile p concentration in the surface sediments of the v natans group increased which may be related to the fact that the aquatic plants were in the decay period in winter and the decomposition of plants promoted the release of labile p from the surface sediments fig 7 d d and f f compared with the no lmb treatment group we found that the lmb inactivation notably reduced labile p concentrations in the surface sediments 0 30 mm depth it is worth noting that the combination of lmb inactivation treatment and planting of v natans low labile p zone at 0 to 60 mm depth exhibited the best remediation effect of sediment labile p fig 7 g and g previous research has suggested that oxygen released from the roots of aquatic macrophytes causes the gradual formation of metallic oxides around the rhizosphere trapping labile p by adsorption and considerably decreasing internal p release han et al 2018 consequently our results suggest that a combination of lmb addition and planting of aquatic vegetation may have an additive effect of reducing sediment labile p this additive effect has been verified in the long term water quality improvement of hangzhou west lake bai et al 2020 as shown in fig 6 bioturbation resulted in the transfer of mobile p into the refractory apatite bound p fraction during the downward migration of lmb thereby reducing the labile p concentrations of the surface sediment meis et al 2013 our results further suggest that combining multiple remediation techniques is more effective than a single remediation technique in controlling sediment labile p from a long term perspective especially in lmb inactivation treatment groups 3 6 internal nitrogen and phosphorus regeneration and release control model by combining multiple remediation techniques the purpose of remediating internal pollution in shallow eutrophic lakes is to effectively control sediment n and p regeneration and release thereby reducing the risk of sustained algal blooms fig 8 the results of this study suggest that the accumulation of om and fe p in sediments is an important source of pollution for long term regeneration and release of pore water nh4 and drp high temperature and low do notably enhanced the pore water drp and nh4 concentrations moreover a recent study indicated that higher nh4 concentrations favored the reduction of fe iii oxy hydr oxides and the desorption of drp into pore water yuan et al 2022 therefore effectively reducing the fe p and om content in the sediment and improving the oxidation conditions of the swi are crucial for controlling the regeneration and release of internal nh4 and drp the aim of controlling sediment p loading is to continuously reduce p diffusion fluxes by reducing the labile p load overall combining multiple remediation techniques is more effective at controlling internal p loads than a single remediation technique to avoid the reduction of remediation efficiency of a single remediation technique dredging adsorbent amendment and planting aquatic vegetation due to wind induced sediment redeposition bioturbation and rising water levels from a long term restoration perspective li et al 2020 chao et al 2022 and considering the restoration effect of planting aquatic vegetation alone in lake datong li et al 2021 we recommend the following a combination of multiple remediation techniques combining dredging at the appropriate depth with other remediation techniques for lake areas with high sediment p pollution and a combination of lmb inactivation and planting aquatic vegetation in other areas during future lake restoration practices 4 conclusion high temperature and low do significantly enhanced pore water drp and nh4 concentrations due to abundant sediment fe p and om content fe reduction plays a crucial role in regulating internal p release and promoting n removal inappropriate dredging depth and low biomass of aquatic vegetation make it challenging to effectively control the internal p load combining multiple remediation techniques especially lmb inactivation groups is more effective than a single remediation technique for controlling internal p loads from a long term perspective these results provide new insights into internal n and p biogeochemical

15195,large anthropogenic inputs of n and p alter the nutrient cycle and exacerbate global eutrophication problems in aquatic ecosystems this study in lake datong china investigates the remediation mechanism of multiple remediation technique combinations dredging adsorbent amendment and planting aquatic vegetation on sediment n and p loads based on two high resolution sampling techniques hr peeper and dgt and p sequential extraction procedures the results showed that high temperature and low dissolved oxygen considerably enhanced pore water dissolved reactive p drp and nh4 concentrations attributable to abundant fe p and organic matter content in the sediment fe reduction is critical for regulating pore water drp release and promoting n removal overall for lake datong combining multiple remediation techniques is more effective in controlling sediment p loads pore water drp p fluxes forms of p and labile p from a long term perspective than a single remediation lanthanum modified bentonite lmb inactivation treatment can transfer mobile p in the surface sediment into more refractory forms over time thereby reducing the risk of sediment labile p release however it is difficult to effectively remediate internal p loads owing to inappropriate dredging depths and low biomass of aquatic vegetation future lake restoration practices should optimize the selection of different remediation technique combinations based on internal n and p pollution characteristics while reducing external wastewater input these results are important for understanding the remediation mechanisms of internal n and p and provide suggestions for sediment management of shallow eutrophic lakes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords remediation mechanism internal loading

e g intensive aquaculture have become one of the most severe global environmental pollution problems over the past decade conley et al 2009 huang et al 2020 hou et al 2022 curbing lake eutrophication through the dual control of n and p inputs is of great interest to limnologists conley et al 2009 paerl et al 2016 zhou et al 2022a even after external nutrient inputs are effectively controlled nutrients stored in internal sediments are continuously released to support high phytoplankton populations especially in shallow eutrophic lakes søndergaard et al 2013 qin et al 2020 zhou et al 2022b the faster accumulation and greater retention of p than n in global lakes under anthropogenic influences potentially causes algal blooms and biodiversity losses yan et al 2016 wu et al 2022 internal regenerated nh4 and mobile p release in eutrophic lakes play increasingly important roles in sustaining cyanobacterial blooms rydin 2000 xue et al 2021 liu et al 2022 the release intensity of n and p from internal sediments is not only related to the amount of nutrients stored but also closely related to the forms of n and p in sediments and changes in external environmental factors li et al 2021 liu et al 2022 previous studies have found that sediments in different areas of eutrophic lakes often show different spatial distribution characteristics of p fractions and organic matter om due to soil erosion external wastewater input and pollutant history for example the fe p p bound to fe oxides and hydroxides and om content were higher in the algae and river mouth distribution areas while the ca p calcium bound p content was higher in aquatic plant distribution areas in the eutrophic lakes chaohu and taihu china liu et al 2019 yang et al 2020 yin et al 2022 fe p the main potentially mobile p component is easily released into the overlying water by increasing the temperature and decreasing dissolved oxygen do søndergaard et al 2013 liu et al 2018 ni et al 2020 furthermore the enhancement of the metabolic activity of ammonifiers due to warming can promote nh4 regeneration rates and accelerate the decomposition of om e g algal debris and do exhaustion all of which boost the release of nh4 from internal sediments amorim and moura 2021 xue et al 2021 the dual control of regeneration and release of internal n and p is critical for the management of lake eutrophication previously many studies have used lanthanum modified zeolites to simultaneously reduce the release of internal n and p from sediment by increasing the ability to fix p and improve do levels li et al 2019 wei et al 2022 however combining multiple remediation techniques dredging adsorbent amendment and planting aquatic vegetation has not been conducted for the in situ remediation of n and p contaminated sediments in shallow eutrophic lakes several lake remediation techniques have been widely applied in recent decades such as physical restoration and sediment dredging chemical restoration and in situ adsorbent amendment and bioremediation and aquatic vegetation reconstruction to control internal nutrient loads in eutrophic lakes sediment dredging is frequently used to remove n and p contaminated sediments from shallow eutrophic lakes however some field studies have shown that dredging for long term restoration effects is challenging to maintain liu et al 2016 jing et al 2019 our previous research found that two years after dredging in lake datong a typical shallow eutrophic aquacultural lake with the redeposition of bioavailable p fe p and organic p op the effectiveness of dredging weakened which in turn increased the risk of p release from sediments li et al 2020 in situ adsorbent amendment can quickly remove dissolved reactive p drp in the overlying water by adding p adsorbent materials such as iron aluminum and calcium salts especially lanthanum modified bentonite lmb this increases the ability of sediment to adsorb p thereby reducing sediment p release and rapidly improving water quality meis et al 2013 lürling et al 2016 however in shallow eutrophic lakes the surface sediments are easily disturbed causing them to be resuspended and thus covering p adsorbent materials after redeposition and reducing the restoration efficiency of these materials wang et al 2022 our previous study found that after the first year of aquatic vegetation restoration in lake datong the content of dissolved p in the overlying water and sediment ca p of the whole lake halved li et al 2021 however we also found that in the second year after the restoration of lake datong the aquatic vegetation cover decreased because the water level in summer and the nh4 and p concentrations in the overlying water increased considerably and the dominant species of planktonic algae changed from bacillariophyta to cyanobacteria chao et al 2022 therefore planting aquatic vegetation alone may not be an ideal measure because of its susceptibility to extreme environmental conditions and combining multiple remediation measures may be more effective in improving long term water quality in shallow lakes bai et al 2020 found that after six years of aquatic vegetation reconstruction through the addition of 10 cm thick modified bentonite to the sediments of the west lake restoration area in hangzhou the water quality notably improved with a gradual increase in the submerged vegetation community however the remediation mechanism of internal n and p combined with multiple remediation techniques remains unclear lake datong is a typical shallow eutrophic p contaminated lake located in the middle reaches of the yangtze river our previous investigation found that after more than a decade of intensive aquaculture the average tp and tn sediment content exceeded 2000 mg kg in 2017 the characteristics of sediment pollution in the lake center lc and lake shore ls of lake datong are typically different therefore lake datong is an ideal research area for restoring sediment n and p pollution by combining multiple remediation techniques in shallow lakes here we selected typical lc and ls sediments in lake datong to explore the ability of the in situ remediation mechanism of combining multiple lake remediation techniques dredging adsorbent amendment and planting aquatic vegetation to control internal n and p regeneration and release via a long term field sediment core experiment the results of this study provide theoretical support for the optimal selection of eutrophic lake remediation techniques and a scientific basis for the precise control of n and p in shallow eutrophic lakes 2 material and method 2 1 materials intact sediment cores 500 90 mm length diameter representing two typical types of sediment pollution were obtained from the ls 29 18 n 112 46 e and lc 29 22 n 112 54 e in lake datong using a sediment core sampler in april 2021 the sampling areas in the lc and ls were located in a historically intensive aquaculture area and near the river mouth of the wuqi canal a large source of input for external effluents a total of 260 sediment cores were randomly collected from the lc and ls for the experiments approximately 500 m2 per sampling site after carefully transferring the sediment cores to the laboratory they were laterally sliced at 1 cm intervals sediment samples from the same depth were sieved 40 mesh mixed evenly and carefully backfilled into the sediment cores manually to remove dead benthic snails mussel shell debris and historically deposited small amounts of undecomposed aquatic plant debris from deep sediments 15 cm depth to reduce experimental errors caused by micro topographic differences except for the removal of dead zoobenthos and plant debris from the surface and deep sediments the experimental sediment cores obtained were consistent with the intact sediment cores each sediment core consisted of 25 cm of sediment and filtered lake water lmb phoslock was purchased from a branch of the phoslock company in china seedlings of vallisneria natans height 5 5 0 5 cm root length 2 1 cm were cultivated with in situ lake water and sediments for the experiment the diffusive gradients in thin films dgt technique and a high resolution dialysis sampler hr peeper were employed to simultaneously measure sediment labile p and pore water drp fe2 and nh4 concentrations at the millimeter scale 2 2 experimental design we randomly screened 120 sediment cores from the lc and ls and a total of 15 sediment cores were used for each of the eight treatments fig 1 1 control a

average depth of the p pollution layer in the surface sediments of lake datong was approximately 7 cm 3 lmb c c sediment cores with lmb added in a ratio of 100 1 based on the mass of mobile p

moreover we divided the eight experimental treatment groups into no lmb treatment control dred v natans dred v natans and lmb inactivation lmb dred lmb lmb v natans dred lmb v natans to avoid the sedimentation of suspended particles in the sediment cores the tops of all sediment core plexiglass tubes were covered with nylon mesh size 250 and all mesh bags were periodically replaced throughout the experiment the sediment cores were then placed in stainless steel frames prepared in advance and fixed on the experimental platform 29 20 n 112 56 e at the bottom of the lake to simulate the actual changes in the lake water environment fig s1 during the experiment a temperature and light recording device hobo onset computer corporation bourne ma usa was used to automatically record the water temperature and light changes at the bottom of the lake every hour the sediment cores were retrieved on day 15 may 2021 45 june 2021 90 august 2021 150 october 2021 and 240 january 2022 at each sampling time 48 sediment cores were collected three independent replicates for each treatment and used to measure pore water drp fe2 and nh4 concentrations sediment cores were collected on days 15 90 and 240 to measure differences in the vertical distribution of sediment p fractions and om content the do of the overlying water was measured using a portable do meter hq1130 hach usa three overlying water samples from each treatment were collected and immediately analyzed for tp at the end of the experiment an analysis was undertaken of the bacterial community composition in sediments and dgt to measure the two dimensional distribution of sediment labile p 2 3 chemical analysis tp in water samples was analyzed using the standard test methods chinese epa 2002 p fractions in sediments were

using a uv 1800 spectrophotometer shimadzu company japan the retrieved dgt and hr peeper probes were handled according to the methods described in the supplementary material of li et al 2020 sediment om content was quantified by the loss on ignition method loi at 550 c for 6 h farmer et al 2014 in the last sampling approximately 2 0 g of surface sediment 0 2 cm samples per treatment were collected for the composition of microbial community analysis detailed information on sequencing and data analysis refer to our previous research methods yu et al 2021 2 4 statistical analysis the data plots and statistical analyses were produced using origin 2019 originlab northampton ma usa we used pearson s correlation analysis to determine the correlations between pore water drp nh4 and fe2 in sediments for data quality control we analyzed three independent replicates of the sediment p fractions loi drp fe2 and nh4 concentration and the average values were used for the data analysis significant differences in variables p fractions p flux loi pore water drp fe2 and nh4 concentration among treatments were identified through one way analysis of variance anova followed by tukey s test significance was set at the p 0 05 levels 3 results and discussion 3 1 sediment properties the sediment properties used in this study between lc and ls in lake datong are presented in table s1 the average tp of the lc and ls surface sediments were 1158 and 1184 mg kg respectively and tn concentrations were 3020 and 2975 mg kg respectively moreover ca p was the main p fraction in lake datong and the fraction of sediment ca p in the lc was significantly higher than that in the ls p 0 003 the ca p content of the lc and ls accounted for 50 8 and 43 7 of tp respectively conversely the fe p content in the ls was significantly higher than that in the lc p 0 001 the fe p content of the ls and lc accounted for 33 5 and 26 8 of tp respectively although mobile p is a potentially bioavailable p source for algae in the lc and ls accounting for 30 0 and 36 5 of the sediment tp respectively yin et al 2022 fe p accounts for 89 3 and 91 7 of the sediment mobile p content respectively industrial and domestic effluent have been proven to increase sediment fe p ni et al 2020 the wuqi canal a primary source of imported agricultural and domestic effluent in the lake datong basin occupies a large proportion of the external n and p inputs resulting in a relatively high fe p content deposited in the ls additionally the higher ca p in the lc may be primarily related to historically intensive aquaculture which involves the application of large amounts of inorganic and organic fertilizers mainly calcium superphosphate and chicken manure there are 38 canals or rivers densely distributed along the shore of lake datong and intensive aquaculture has been conducted for more than ten years in the lake center therefore the sediments of the two sampling sites in this study represent two typical pollution types in lake datong 3 2 effects of multiple remediation techniques on pore water drp fe2 and nh4 we observed that different experimental treatments profoundly influenced the pore water drp concentration variation in surface sediments 0 30 mm depth fig 2 and table 1 previous research has shown that the active layer of p is concentrated at the sediment water interface swi and sediments act as a p source during algal blooms the peak shape distributions of pore water drp profiles are related to the depth of the oxide layer and sediment p properties wang et al 2015 yao et al 2016 compared with the control group we observed that dredging alone 70 mm depth reduced the pore water drp concentration of the surface sediments in august day 90 in the lc p 0 001 and ls except for october day 150 p 0 016 table 1 the difference in dredging effectiveness between lc and ls may be related to decreased sediment om content p fractions and the improvement of redox conditions after dredging sinsabaugh et al 2008 jing et al 2013 compared to the control group dredging reduced the loi of surface sediments 0 30 mm depth in the lc and ls from 7 0 0 7 and 7 4 0 8 to 6 0 1 6 and 5 4 2 2 respectively fig s2 simultaneously we observed that the mobile p concentration of surface sediments 0 30 mm depth in the lc and ls increased significantly from 334 3 12 2 to 390 4 15 4 mg kg p 0 008 and decreased drastically from 355 4 41 1 to 145 3 11 2 mg kg p 0 002 after dredging alone respectively table s2 our results indicated that compared with the lc dredging to 7 cm depth has a greater effect on the removal of pore water drp concentration in the ls notably our earlier study found that dredging to 110 cm in the lc of lake datong reduced ca p and om surface sediment concentrations and drp diffusion flux in summer meanwhile deeper dredging depths in the lc easily lead to the redeposition of bioavailable p e g fe p and op after two years of dredging increasing the risk of internal p release li et al 2020 however this study showed that dredging alone to 7 cm in the ls can effectively reduce the p diffusion flux fig 5 whereas the ineffectiveness in the lc increased the mobile p concentration of the surface sediments fig 6 and table s2 therefore the depth and scope of dredging should be determined according to the degree of p enrichment in the surface sediments of the different lake areas moreover we observed that the addition of lmb alone cloud significantly reduce the pore water drp concentration of the surface sediments in the lc except in january day 240 p 0 001 and ls p 0 019 previous studies have shown that adding lmb can quickly and efficiently remove drp from the water column by the formation of the stable mineral rhabdophane lapo4 nh2o while intercepting and adsorbing drp released from bottom sediments copetti et al 2016 lürling et al 2016 our results were consistent with these results showing that adding lmb can effectively reduce the surface sediment pore water drp concentration compared to dredging yin et al 2021 however compared to the control group we found that planting low density v natans alone was less effective in removing pore water drp concentrations furthermore we found that multiple remediation technique combinations especially lmb inactivation groups could effectively reduce the pore water drp concentration of surface sediments p 0 002 compared with the control group and a single remediation technique except for the dred v natans group in the lc in august day 90 and the lc and ls in january day 240 table 1 our results show that lmb inactivation treatments single and multiple remediation techniques can markedly reduce the pore water drp concentration in surface sediments from a long term restoration perspective and for practical application implications our results suggest that a combination of dredging at the appropriate depth by removing internal contaminants e g om and p fractions and lmb addition through adsorbing drp may have an additive effect on reducing pore water drp concentrations in lake areas with high sediment p pollution we observed that the pore water fe2 concentration in the sediment was considerably greater during the warmer seasons from june to october fig 3 simultaneously compared with the control group other remediation methods except planting v natans alone significantly reduced the pore water fe2 concentration of surface sediments 0 30 mm depth in the lc p 0 033 and ls p 0 001 in summer but had no significant effect in winter moreover we observed a stronger positive correlation between pore water fe2 and drp across five months for the eight treatment groups between the lc and ls fig s4 s8 our results suggest that fe redox cycling plays a vital role in regulating the release of internal p from the lc and ls here fe p accounted for approximately 90 of the sediment mobile p content between the lc and ls table s1 meanwhile we found that the do concentration in the water column of the sediment cores in summer was significantly lower than that in winter p 0 001 fig s3 b and b in the shallow lake datong especially the rising temperatures in summer accelerated the decomposition of om e g algal and aquatic plant debris while consuming a large amount of oxygen and boosting the microbial reduction of p hosted fe oxyhydr oxide resulting in a massive release of fe p liu et al 2018 wang et al 2019 except for in winter we found that the pore water fe2 concentration of the surface sediments 0 30 mm depth of the control group in the lc was significantly higher than that in the ls 2 7 times p 0 032 fig 3 a and a probably related to the higher residual om due to long term aquaculture fertilization in the lc huang et al 2020 yogev et al 2020 our results indicate that temperature do and om content strongly affect the pore water fe2 sediment concentration therefore to minimize the release of internal p future lake remediation measures should focus on removing fe p and om content and improving the redox conditions of surface sediments e g planting perennial aquatic plants with developed roots and a strong oxygen secretion capacity especially in the lc in summer we also observed that the pore water nh4 concentration in the lc was significantly higher than that in the ls across all five months for all eight treatment groups p 0 001 fig 4 earlier studies have found that rapid internal nh4 regeneration rates may strongly support the persistence of cyanobacterial blooms andersen et al 2019 xue et al 2021 therefore future research should investigate the relationship between the regeneration of internal nh4 and algal blooms especially in the lc although the difference in pore water nh4 concentrations between different treatment groups in the same sampling period was not very obvious we found that the concentration of pore water nh4 in may day 15 except for groups c and f and in august day 90 in the lc p 0 008 and in may and august except for group h in the ls p 0 05 were significantly higher than those in january day 240 earlier research has suggested that temperature and do play critical roles in regulating the accumulation and release of pore water nh4 in shallow lakes zhong et al 2021 sun et al 2022 particularly during late spring and summer rising temperatures promote algal blooms enhance microbial activity and accelerate the decomposition of om and do exhaustion thereby promoting the accumulation and release of pore water nh4 xue et al 2021 sun et al 2022 furthermore previous findings suggest that continued deposition of external suspended particulate matter absorbing large amounts of water soluble om in the river mouth substantially increases the concentration and diffusion flux of sediment nh4 due to the decomposition of fresh om liu et al 2019 zhong et al 2021 as the sampling area in the ls is located near the mouth of the wuqi canal frequent external water soluble om input and abundant emergent plant debris trapa bispinosa nelumbo nucifera etc result in the deposition of om in the surface sediments correspondingly the higher pore water nh4 concentration in the lc is likely related to the high density application of organic fertilizers mainly chicken manure in the past decade previous research has shown that the changes in om quantity largely depend on the grain size of sediments with higher sediment om quantity in fine sediments yan et al 2022 this was consistent with our observation that there was a higher surface area and adsorption sites of clay fine particle size in the lc than in the silt in the ls additionally we found a stronger positive correlation between pore water nh4 and fe2 across all five months for all eight treatment groups p 0 001 fig s9 s13 previous research has shown that anaerobic ammonium oxidation coupled with ferric iron reduction termed feammox plays a vital role in wetland nitrogen removal li et al 2015 notably high concentrations of om lead to the formation of fe iii oxides in sediments affecting the abundance of functional microorganisms related to nitrogen cycling and promoting the feammox reaction li et al 2015 xiong et al 2022 moreover we found that proteobacteria chloroflexi and nitrospirota were the three most abundant phyla in sediments between lc and ls in winter fig s14 playing a crucial role in decomposing sediment om and promoting n fe and p cycling chaudhry et al 2012 shu et al 2016 fan et al 2018 our earlier findings also suggested that the dominant microbial species except cyanobacteria in sediments in summer were similar to those in winter chao et al 2021 moreover recent studies have found that proteobacteria are positively correlated with sediment ca p playing an important role in sediment p immobilization yin et al 2022 our results further suggest that fe plays an essential role in regulating internal n cycling temperature do and om content have a powerful effect on the pore water nh4 concentration in sediments 3 3 effects of multiple remediation techniques on p flux we observed that the p diffusion flux between lc and ls of the control group in the warm season was significantly higher than that in winter p 0 001 fig 5 high temperatures especially in summer had a more notable impact on the p diffusion flux in the ls possibly related to the high fe p and om content in the ls visser et al 2016 as we observed fe p accounted for approximately 90 of the mobile p content in lake datong where the high temperature and low do concentration in summer enhanced the release of sediment fe p fig 5 and s3 simultaneously we observed inconsistent responses of p diffusion fluxes in the lc and ls to the different experimental treatments dredging alone could effectively reduce the p diffusion flux in the ls except in winter p 0 001 but it did not affect the lc furthermore the negative remediation effect was observed in the dred v natans group in the lc and the reason for this phenomenon is probably related to the deeper p enrichment in the lc fig 6 additionally we found that the inhibition of internal p release by planting v natans alone was lower than that in the control group this was inconsistent with our previous results which showed that submerged vegetation growth can effectively inhibit internal p release li et al 2021 this discrepancy is likely related to the low v natans biomass fresh weight per unit area 467 g m2 in this study while the average biomass fresh weight and density were 2873 g m2 and 282 plants m2 respectively in october 2018 when the v natans community coverage reached 100 in lake datong low coverage and low biomass per unit area of submerged vegetation did not effectively inhibit the release of sediment p compared with the no lmb treatment group we found that the lmb inactivation treatment significantly reduced the p diffusion flux at the swi across all five months between the lc and ls p 0 001 previous studies have shown that the addition of lmb can effectively inhibit the release of internal p by providing a barrier to intercept internal p loading and increasing the mass of p strongly bound in the sediment the more refractory apatite bound p fraction meis et al 2013 mucci et al 2020 our results suggest that combining lmb inactivation with other remediation techniques is more effective for controlling internal p release 3 4 effects of multiple remediation techniques on sediment p properties the mobile p content of the sediments decreased with depth in the ls control group in contrast the difference in the mobile p content between the surface and deeper sediments in the lc showed a consistent distribution pattern fig 6 simultaneously we observed that the mobile p content of surface sediments 0 100 mm depth in the lc and ls increased significantly from 326 1 12 6 to 449 1 66 9 mg kg p 0 001 and decreased from 265 9 84 7 to 135 0 13 2 mg kg p 0 001 after dredging alone respectively fig 6 and table s3 our results further showed that the sediment mobile p enrichment in the high density aquaculture area in the lc more than 7 cm deep and inappropriate dredging depth conversely increased the risk of sediment mobile p release previous studies have shown that mobile p is easily released into overlying water with changes in environmental conditions such as temperature and do ni et al 2020 yang et al 2022 consequently for the high density aquaculture area in the lc priority should be given to adopting a deeper dredging depth to remove the mobile p content and reduce the long term release risk of internal p moreover we observed that the ca p content of the sediment gradually increased from day 15 to the 240 after the addition of lmb fig 6 c c e e g g and h h our findings are consistent with earlier results showing that the application of lmb can transfer mobile p into the more refractory p fraction over time thereby reducing the risk of internal p release meis et al 2013 yin et al 2021 moreover we observed a downward migration process of lmb in groups c c and g g with time whereas groups e e and h h did not show this migration trend previous studies have shown that lmb can migrate down via bioturbation e g chironomids meysman et al 2006 reitzel et al 2013 many chironomids appeared in the upper sediments of groups c c and g g on day 15 and the deeper sediments were transported to the surface layer by animal disturbance over time however there is no apparent downward migration trend of lmb in groups e e and h h probably because dredging removes the chironomids living in the surface sediments and the more rigid sediment layer after dredging is not conducive to the survival of chironomids although we observed healthy growth of v natans throughout the experimental period we did not observe an effect of planting v natans alone on different p fractions in the sediments compared with the control group this was inconsistent with our previous findings in lake datong where the growth of v natans effectively reduced the different forms of p in sediments especially ca p li et al 2021 the difference was probably related to the low community density of v natans making it difficult for low aquatic vegetation biomass to effectively absorb large amounts of p from the sediment 3 5 effects of multiple remediation techniques on sediment labile p to further explore the long term control effects of different remediation techniques on internal p loads the two dimensional sediment distribution of labile p was measured using a high resolution dgt method at the end of the experiment fig 7 we observed that labile p content in the deeper sedimentary layer 40 to 100 mm depth in the lc was significantly higher than that in the ls further indicating that the sediments in the lc have a greater potential for the release of internal labile p meanwhile compared with the control group dredging increased the concentration of labile p in the deep sediments of the lc and decreased the concentration of labile p in the ls fig 7 b b and e e moreover we found that the labile p concentration in the surface sediments of the v natans group increased which may be related to the fact that the aquatic plants were in the decay period in winter and the decomposition of plants promoted the release of labile p from the surface sediments fig 7 d d and f f compared with the no lmb treatment group we found that the lmb inactivation notably reduced labile p concentrations in the surface sediments 0 30 mm depth it is worth noting that the combination of lmb inactivation treatment and planting of v natans low labile p zone at 0 to 60 mm depth exhibited the best remediation effect of sediment labile p fig 7 g and g previous research has suggested that oxygen released from the roots of aquatic macrophytes causes the gradual formation of metallic oxides around the rhizosphere trapping labile p by adsorption and considerably decreasing internal p release han et al 2018 consequently our results suggest that a combination of lmb addition and planting of aquatic vegetation may have an additive effect of reducing sediment labile p this additive effect has been verified in the long term water quality improvement of hangzhou west lake bai et al 2020 as shown in fig 6 bioturbation resulted in the transfer of mobile p into the refractory apatite bound p fraction during the downward migration of lmb thereby reducing the labile p concentrations of the surface sediment meis et al 2013 our results further suggest that combining multiple remediation techniques is more effective than a single remediation technique in controlling sediment labile p from a long term perspective especially in lmb inactivation treatment groups 3 6 internal nitrogen and phosphorus regeneration and release control model by combining multiple remediation techniques the purpose of remediating internal pollution in shallow eutrophic lakes is to effectively control sediment n and p regeneration and release thereby reducing the risk of sustained algal blooms fig 8 the results of this study suggest that the accumulation of om and fe p in sediments is an important source of pollution for long term regeneration and release of pore water nh4 and drp high temperature and low do notably enhanced the pore water drp and nh4 concentrations moreover a recent study indicated that higher nh4 concentrations favored the reduction of fe iii oxy hydr oxides and the desorption of drp into pore water yuan et al 2022 therefore effectively reducing the fe p and om content in the sediment and improving the oxidation conditions of the swi are crucial for controlling the regeneration and release of internal nh4 and drp the aim of controlling sediment p loading is to continuously reduce p diffusion fluxes by reducing the labile p load overall combining multiple remediation techniques is more effective at controlling internal p loads than a single remediation technique to avoid the reduction of remediation efficiency of a single remediation technique dredging adsorbent amendment and planting aquatic vegetation due to wind induced sediment redeposition bioturbation and rising water levels from a long term restoration perspective li et al 2020 chao et al 2022 and considering the restoration effect of planting aquatic vegetation alone in lake datong li et al 2021 we recommend the following a combination of multiple remediation techniques combining dredging at the appropriate depth with other remediation techniques for lake areas with high sediment p pollution and a combination of lmb inactivation and planting aquatic vegetation in other areas during future lake restoration practices 4 conclusion high temperature and low do significantly enhanced pore water drp and nh4 concentrations due to abundant sediment fe p and om content fe reduction plays a crucial role in regulating internal p release and promoting n removal inappropriate dredging depth and low biomass of aquatic vegetation make it challenging to effectively control the internal p load combining multiple remediation techniques especially lmb inactivation groups is more effective than a single remediation technique for controlling internal p loads from a long term perspective these results provide new insights into internal n and p biogeochemical

15196,extreme precipitation events caused by climate change leads to large variation of nitrogen input to aquatic ecosystems our previous study demonstrated the significant effect of different ammonium pulse patterns differing in magnitude and frequency on submersed macrophyte growth based on six plant morphological traits however how connectivity among plant traits responds to nitrogen pulse changes which in turn affects plant performance has not yet been fully elucidated the response of three common submersed macrophytes myriophyllum spicatum vallisneria natans and potamogeton maackianus to three ammonium pulse patterns was tested using plant trait network ptn analysis based on 18 measured physiological and morphological traits we found that ammonium pulses enhanced trait connectivity in ptn which may enable plants to assimilate ammonium and or mitigate ammonium toxicity large input pulses with low frequency had stronger effects on ptns compared to low input pulses with high frequency due to the cumulative and time lagged effect of the plant response to the ammonium pulse there was a profound and prolonged effect on plant performance after the release of the pulse the highly connected traits in ptn were those related to biomass allocation e g plant biomass stem ratio leaf ratio and ramet number rather than physiological traits while phenotype related traits e g plant height root length and ab ratio and energy storage related traits e g stem starch were least connected v natans showed clear functional divergence among traits making it more flexible to cope with unfavorable habitats i e high input pulses with low frequencies m spicatum with high rgr revealed strong correlations among traits and thus supported nitrogen accumulation from favourable environments i e low input pulses with high frequencies our study highlights the responses of ptn for submerged macrophytes to ammonium pulses depends on their intrinsic metabolic rates the magnitude frequency and duration of the pulses and our results contribute to the understanding of the impact of resource pulses on the population dynamics of submersed macrophytes within the context of global climate change graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pulse size ammonium pulse plant trait network submerged macrophyte data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction resource pulse is defined as a significant increase in available resources over a short time a phenomenon that is widespread in ecosystems mallon et al 2015 tao et al 2021 weber and brown 2018 in freshwater ecosystems precipitation induced runoff from agricultural systems vegetation deficient areas and urban substrates can markedly increase the nutrient content and decrease the light intensity of water bodies wang et al 2014 yang et al 2008 studies have found that rainfall runoff can increase nitrogen in water bodies substantially fong et al 2020 li et al 2017 generally the magnitude and frequency of such resource pulses are influenced by the intensity and duration of precipitation due to the global climate change extreme precipitation events will occur more frequently in the future which in turn will change resource pulse patterns e g magnitude and frequency brown et al 2022 li et al 2019 wang et al 2022 resource pulses can profoundly affect the morphological and physiological traits of plants altering the correlations between plant traits and driving changes in the composition of plant community structure with far reaching effects on ecosystems fu et al 2022 gratton et al 2017 holt 2008 tan et al 2019 yang et al 2010 however current studies on the effects of resource pulses have mainly focused on terrestrial ecosystems inglima et al 2009 miller et al 2019 tao et al 2021 while the mechanisms affecting plants in freshwater ecosystems are not well elucidated submerged macrophytes are primary producers in aquatic ecosystems playing an important role in purifying water preventing substrate suspension providing spawning and refuge sites for aquatic animals and maintaining lake biodiversity engelhardt and ritchie 2002 han et al 2021 phillips et al 2016 nitrate and ammonium are the main forms of nitrogen available for submerged macrophytes eliašová et al 2021 nelson et al 1981 ammonium however have ambiguous effects appropriate increases in ammonium concentrations would be beneficial for submerged macrophyte growth while excessive increases may cause physiological toxicity cao et al 2007 yuan et al 2015 free nh3 decrease the chlorophyll content gao et al 2019 inhibit respiration and affect the electron transport system of the plants vines and wedding 1960 to prevent nh4 toxicity soluble carbohydrates are consumed to provide the carbon skeleton in the synthesis of nh4 to free amino acids faa resulting in a decrease in soluble carbohydrates and an increase in thee faa content gao et al 2020 yuan et al 2013 low light availability can exacerbate ammonium toxicity due to insufficient photosynthetic carbohydrate supply leading to degradation of submerged macrophytes cao et al 2009 yuan et al 2013 furthermore in consequence of the warming climate the increased concentrations of organic matter due to algal blooms and reduced oxygen content will alter the bacterial community composition of the sediment trigger dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium and increase the ammonium contents in the sediment and the water column gao et al 2022 song et al 2021 zhou et al 2016 the elevated ammonium content and more frequent anaerobic conditions in the sediment will exacerbate carbon depletion and ammonium accumulation in submerged macrophytes especially in their root system marzocchi et al 2019 yuan et al 2015 the effects of ammonium concentrations in the water column on plant traits have been widely studied ochieng et al 2021 yuan et al 2013 2015 whereas only few investigations have focused on the effects of ammonium pulses on submersed macrophyte traits the effect of nitrogen pulses on plant traits i e morphological and physiological traits is closely related to the magnitude and frequency of the ammonium pulses cable et al 2008 davidson et al 2012 li and stevens 2017 given the toxic effects of high ammonium levels we hypothesize that the pulse pattern of high ammonium concentrations with low frequency can severely limit the growth and ammonium assimilation of submerged macrophytes however the effect depends on the intrinsic ability of the plants to capture and assimilate ammonium lamb et al 2012 parepa et al 2019 resource acquiring plants characterised by a high relative growth rate rgr and or high light saturation points generally have a greater ability to capture nitrogen from pulses while resource conserving plants with low rgr and high nutrient storage capacity are expected to be better adapted to unfavorable external environments such as high ammonium conditions frevola and hovick 2019 yuan et al 2013 we therefore hypothesize that submerged macrophytes with high rgr would perform better under pulses with low ammonium concentration while plants with low rgrs would be more tolerant under pulse patterns with high ammonium concentration furthermore plant traits are combined into an efficient trait network through positive or negative feedback regulation and the coordination between traits characterises the trade offs and redistribution of limited resources among plant traits fu et al 2014 he et al 2020 ottaviani et al 2017 current studies of submerged macrophytes however mainly focus on specific tissues e g root stem and leaf and or multiple traits rather than the whole plant frevola and hovick 2019 ochieng et al 2021 yuan et al 2021 a plant trait network ptn analysis can provide information about complex relationships among traits if plant traits are considered as nodes and trait trait relationships as edges multiple traits can be integrated by the relationships used to form a ptn trait trait relationships can be quantified by correlation analyses kleyer et al 2019 rao et al 2021 and the overall plant resistance to changing environments can be evaluated by calculating the topological parameters of the network e g modularity degree and diameter he et al 2020 modularity helps to identify the clustering tendency for traits within a trait network newman 2006 high modularity means that the modules composed of specific traits perform specific functions giving the plants more freedom and flexibility to respond to harsh environments and thus a high ability of stress tolerance flores moreno et al 2019 gilarranz et al 2017 degree can be used to quantify the relative importance of a trait for a given trait network he et al 2020 li et al 2022 and diameter provide information about the strength of the coordination among multiple traits he et al 2020 we can expect that ammonium pulses significantly increase the connectivity between traits as a way to improve assimilation or detoxification of ammonium which in turn affects the plant growth our previous study tested the effects of different ammonium pulse patterns differing in magnitude and frequency on plant growth by measuring six morphological traits i e plant biomass plant height branch number leaf number root length and total branch length of three submersed macrophyte species myriophyllum spicatum l potamogeton maackianus a bennett and vallisneria natans lour hara and the results demonstrated that the effects were species specific and pulse pattern dependent tan et al 2019 however how plants adjust inter trait connectivity to adapt to ammonia pulses changes remains to be elucidated from a whole plant view in fact multiple plant traits respond synergistically to ammonia pulse changes allowing plants to enhance their adaptability to changing environments in the present study we tested the effect of different ammonium pulse patterns on the connectivity among eighteen plant traits by adding ten physiological traits as well as biomass and metabolite allocation among root stem and leaf tissues given the increase in ammonium loading to aquatic ecosystems due to extreme precipitation and the toxic effects of high ammonium on plants ballard et al 2019 ochieng et al 2021 sinha et al 2017 xian et al 2020 zhang et al 2022 we hypothesised that 1 ammonium pulses increase the connectivity between traits in ptn 2 traits closely related to ammonium assimilation have high degree and 3 networks with a high modularity value are more resistant to high ammonium pulses three common submerged macrophytes with different rgrs were selected and plant traits were measured firstly nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds was performed on the basis of the traits to determine the relative influence of treatments on plant performance secondly by calculating the value of parameters i e modularity degree and diameter of ptn the effect of different pulse patterns the same loading but with different magnitude frequency on the ptn was assessed as was the response of different plant traits to resource pulses thirdly mantel analysis was carried out to decipher the relationship between individual traits and the whole plant performance we finally elucidated the mechanisms underlying the response of submerged macrophytes to ammonium pulses based on ptns our results contribute importantly to the understanding of the response of various submersed macrophyte species to a resource pulse 2 materials and methods 2 1 study species three common dominant submerged macrophytes myriophyllum spicatum l vallisneria natans lour hara and potamogeton maackianus a bennett were selected all widely distributed in aquatic ecosystems ranging in state from oligotrophic to mesotrophic in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river in china fu et al 2019 rao et al 2021 the three species have different metabolic rates thus m spicatum has a higher rgr and assimilation rate as well as a higher respiration rate than v natans and p maackianus fu et al 2012 su et al 2004 moreover their growth form varies with m spicatum and p maackianus being canopy formed and v natans rosette formed yuan et al 2016 also their light requirement differ with v natans having significantly lower light compensation and saturation points than the other two species su et al 2004 furthermore many studies have shown that these three species have a high ability to improve the water quality by taking up nutrients and inhibiting the growth of phytoplankton and periphytic algae huang et al 2010 rao et al 2021 and especially v natans is widely used in current lake restoration initiatives in china liu et al 2018 2 2 experimental design the experimental design is described in detail in tan et al 2019 in brief apical shoots of m spicatum and p maackianus and intact plants of v natans were transplanted into 1152 experimental cups diameter 6 0 cm height 7 5 cm total of 384 shoots plants and one shoot plant per cup for both m spicatum and v natans giving a total of 768 shoots and two shoots per cup for p maackianus the plants shoots were placed uniformly in 96 experimental buckets diameter 33 0 cm height 40 0 cm 12 cups in each bucket 32 buckets per species the experiment was divided into two phases nh4 n pulse 16 days phase i and nh4 n release 12 days phase ii within phase i of the nh4 n pulse four nh4 n pulse patterns were applied to the plants hclf high concentration with low frequency 4 mg l 1 nh4 n added to the water column every four days 4 times mcmf moderate concentration with moderate frequency 2 mg l 1 nh4 n every two days lchf low concentration with high frequency 1 mg l 1 nh4 n every day twenty four buckets with no nh4 n loading were used as control during phase ii of the nh4 n release the water in all the buckets was emptied and the buckets were refilled with tap water and the plants were maintained for 12 days see the experimental design fig 1 for details the experimental design included two light treatments hl high light of about 576 umol m 2 s 1 at noon at the surface of the water column ll low light of approximately 288 umol m 2 s 1 at noon at the surface of the water column each treatment combination was replicated four times for each species with 48 shoots plants per treatment for both m spicatum and v natans and 96 shoots for p maackianus as for light intensity the two levels of daylight hl and ll were created by covering the buckets with 1 and 2 layers of black mesh nets respectively the light intensity of hl and ll applied in the present study was equivalent to 50 and 25 sunlight respectively in the water column colonized by natural submerged macrophyte communities tan et al 2019 yuan et al 2021 the concentrations of alkali hydrolysable n available p available k and organic material in the sediments were 0 11 0 03 0 12 and 19 95 mg g 1 respectively the water temperature was 29 8 c 36 9 c during the experiment 2 3 plant trait measurements plant harvest and measurement of selected plant morphological traits plant biomass plant height root length and ramet number were made see also tan et al 2019 during phases i and ii one experimental plant cup was randomly harvested from each bucket every four days and plant morphological and physiological traits were assessed samples were collected four times during phase i and three times during phase ii the morphological traits were plant fresh biomass including shoot root and stolon root fresh biomass g stem fresh biomass g leaf fresh biomass g plant height cm root length cm ramet number and above below ground biomass ratio ab ratio plant height was measured as the distance from the base of the shoot to the apex of the longest leaf tan et al 2019 after measuring morphological characteristics the tissues leaves stems and roots were oven dried at 80 c to a weight to measure c n metabolites the dried tissues of the three species were ground to a fine powder approximately 50 mg of sample powder was extracted twice with 8 ml 80 ethanol at 80 c for 20 min followed by centrifugation at 10 000 x g for 15 min the supernatant was collected decolourised with activated carbon and filtered microvoid membrane φ20mm the filtrate was used for the analysis of soluble carbohydrates sc free amino acids faa no3 n and nh4 n hecht and mohr 1990 meyer 1957 yemm and willis 1954 using glucose and alanine nitrate of potash and ammonium chloride as standards respectively the residue after centrifugation was used for analysis of starch dirk et al 1999 tn total nitrogen and tc total carbon of the plant samples were determined by an elemental analyzer thermo flash 2000 cambridge uk 2 4 plant trait network analysis ptns help clarifying complex relationships among traits and further enable calculation of metrics for the topology of trait coordination and how they shift across treatments a network consists of a series of nodes and edges in ptns plant traits are nodes and trait trait relationships are edges first a matrix of trait trait relationships r was calculated after normalised transformation for 18 plant traits and these relationships were quantified using significant pearson correlations second a threshold of r 0 2 indicated significant correlations among traits at p 0 05 which was used to avoid spurious correlations among traits kleyer et al 2019 rao et al 2021 trait trait correlations below this threshold were assigned as 0 and correlations above this threshold were assigned as 1 an adjacency matrix a a i j with a i j ε 0 1 was estimated thus a only shows the presence and absence of connections between two plant traits he et al 2020 kleyer et al 2019 finally the parameters of ptns were calculated using the package igraph in r he et al 2020 ptns were visualised using cytoscape 3 9 1 kleyer et al 2019 to decipher differences in trait interactions among four pulse patterns and three species ptn analysis was performed and the following three parameters were calculated 1 modularity defined as the fraction of connections among plant traits that falls within a given module minus the same fraction in a random model where trait trait relationships are randomly distributed deng et al 2012 newman 2006 high modularity means that plant traits within modules are closely connected with each other while the connections between modules are weak meaning that the modules composed of specific traits perform specific functions a higher modularity of the network i e more modules or trait dimensions may give plants more freedom and flexibility to respond to unfavorable environments while maintaining a normal performance kleyer et al 2019 2 degree is the number of edges that connect a focal node trait to other nodes the degree value of a specific trait can be calculated according to the following equation he et al 2020 rao et al 2022 k i j i a i j where ki is the degree of the focal node trait i aij is the correlation between the focal node trait i and node trait j aij is the adjacency matrix described above plant traits with a high degree can be considered as hub traits that play an important role in regulating the whole plant phenotype kleyer et al 2019 rao et al 2021 3 diameter is the maximum shortest distance between any two connected node traits in the network and can be calculated according by the following equation he et al 2020 d i m a x d i j i j where di is the diameter value of the focal node trait i dij is the shortest distance between focal node trait i and node trait j diameter describes the coordination among the traits the shorter diameter the stronger is the coordination among the traits and the higher resource utilization efficiency or production efficiency of the plant he et al 2020 2 5 statistical analysis nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds plots displayed the space difference between the three species two light levels four pulse patterns and seven harvest times based on the gower matrix function metamds in the r package vegan of the 672 samples pearson s correlations between plant morphological and physiological traits and chemical properties in the water column were determined by the r package ggcor relationships between whole plant level functions and plant traits and water chemical properties were determined by the mantel test to evaluate the importance of network organization and interaction for whole plant level functions all trait data obtained from four pulse patterns at two light levels for three species were transformed to gower distances these analyses were conducted using the r package vegan one way analysis of variance with duncan s post hoc test was used to compare the differences in mean plant traits among treatments the physiological traits of plants collected during the seven harvest times were analysed by repeated measures anova 3 results 3 1 distribution in plant trait space to visualize differences in the plant trait space among the three species pulse patterns light intensity and harvest times a gower matrix was performed for nmds ordination that was well fitted stress 0 101 r 2 values for the nonlinear and linear regressions were 0 989 and 0 958 respectively on the first axis of the nmds physiological and morphological traits were clearly separated all physiological traits being located in the positive direction of nmds1 on the second axis of the nmds both morphological and physiological traits diverged fig 2 the nmds analysis showed a clear divergence in the response of the three species to the ammonium pulse m spicatum and p maackianus were in the positive zone of nmds1 and p maackianus and v natans were in the positive zone of nmds2 compared to the control all three pulse patterns significantly altered the plant traits the effects of hclf and lchf were the most pronounced followed by mcmf the nmds ordination plot revealed that the high and low light treatments were close together on both axes indicating that light level had a relatively insignificant effect on the response of plant traits to the ammonium pulse fig 2 there was a significant shift in plant traits between sampling times suggesting a time dependent response of plant traits to the ammonium pulse the sequence increased from the first to the fourth sampling event on both axes during phase i of the nh4 n pulse indicating a cumulative effect on plant traits as the pulse duration increased during phase ii of the nh4 n release the sequence from the fifth to the seventh sampling increased on both axes and then decreased indicating that plant traits did not recover immediately after release from the pulse but that plant traits gradually recovered over time fig 2 3 2 plant trait network compared to the control the modularity of the three ammonium pulse patterns decreased with hclf and lchf exhibited the smallest modularity fig 3 indicating that the three pulse patterns resulted in tighter connectivity between modules the three pulse patterns resulted in a significant increase in trait degree fig 3 indicating an increase in the number of connecting edges and a closer correlation among traits compared with lchf the diameters of hclf and mcmf decreased suggesting that the resource transfer efficiency between traits increased plant biomass stem ratio leaf ratio and ramet number had the highest degrees in the four networks fig 4 indicating a stronger correlation with other traits in comparison stem starch ab ratio root length and plant height had relatively low degrees in the networks the degree of leaf and stem physiological traits was medium in terms of degree the degree of sc in leaves and stems was obviously higher for the three pulse patterns than in the control fig 4 among the three species v natans had the highest modularity and the lowest degree fig 5 this indicates that v natans has a higher separation of modules and tighter trait connectivity within the modules than the other two species p maackianus and m spicatum had a lower modularity and average diameter and a higher average degree indicating close trait trait correlations and a high efficiency of resource transfer between traits m spicatum and p maackianus had significantly higher degrees of leaf nh4 n and leaf faa and a lower ab ratio degree than that of v natans fig 6 the three species all had low degrees for stem starch leaf sc and stem sc root starch and sc for v natans the pearson correlation analysis showed a significant negative correlation between plant root and leaf biomass and ramet number with physiological traits in leaves and stems fig 7 leaf physiological traits were positively correlated with stem physiological traits mantel test analysis showed significant relationships between whole plant performance with each plant trait p 0 01 fig 7 with mantel r values being higher than 0 5 for plant root and leaf biomass and ramet number whole plant performance was significantly related p 0 05 to all five chemical indicators in the water column 3 3 changes in plant traits for v natans the three ammonium pulse patterns increased the nh4 n and faa contents during the nh4 n pulse phase and decreased the sc content while the starch and no3 n contents did not differ fig s1 s4 however during the nh4 n release phase there were no significant differences in the nh4 n and faa contents between the three pulse patterns and the control for m spicatum the three ammonium pulse patterns resulted in an increase in the contents of nh4 n faa starch and no3 n compared to the control during the nh4 n pulse phase while there was no significant difference in sc fig s2 s5 during the nh4 n release phase nh4 n and faa were still higher and sc lower at high light compared to the control for p maackianus the three pulse patterns increased the nh4 n faa and starch contents at both light levels during the nh4 n pulse phase while the sc content decreased and the no3 n content increased at high light level fig s3 s6 during the nh4 n release phase sc was lower for the three pulse patterns than in the control while there were no differences in nh4 n faa starch and no3 n the three pulse patterns resulted in a significant increase in both leaf tn and stem tn compared to the control fig 8 for m spicatum the highest increase in tn was observed in lchf followed by mcmf and the lowest in hclf v natans also showed the same increasing trend as m spicatum for the three pulse patterns there was no significant difference in tn among the three pulse patterns for p maackianus for the three species there were no significant differences in leaf tc between the three pulse patterns and the control group stem tc in hclf was significantly lower for m spicatum and significantly higher for p maackianus at high light compared to the control 4 discussion extreme precipitation events are likely to change the pattern magnitude and frequency of ammonium pulses in lakes which in turn may impact the physiology and morphological traits of plants ptn analysis is a useful tool for assessing effects of ammonium pulse patterns on plant traits from a whole plant perspective we found that 1 ammonium pulse effects depended on the magnitude frequency and duration of the pulses and were species specific 2 the three pulse patterns had marked impacts on the ptns with tighter connectivity among traits than that in the control 3 resource conserving species i e v natans exhibited more distinct functional differentiation across traits enabling higher adaptability of plants to a wide range of unfavorable environments overall the ammonium pulse had a profound influence on the plant trait network which subsequently affected the plant growth performance 4 1 divergence in the effects of different pulse patterns on ptn the ammonium pulses led to increased inter module connectivity and closer correlation between traits as we found a decrease in the modularity of ptn and an increase in average degree which may accelerate the uptake and or assimilation of ammonium in the water column positive or negative correlations between traits are usually considered to be trade offs of synergistic optimization or allocation of the limited resources among tissues traits based on biochemical and or physiological needs moreover the supply of carbon affects the response of plants to nitrogen for example the conversion from ammonium to faa requires provision of a carbon skeleton cao et al 2011 and plants actively remove the ammonium entering cells at an uncontrolled rate to reduce ammonium toxicity which leads to a high carbohydrate consumption britto et al 2001 this in turn affects the overall carbon allocation of the plant leading to adjustments of plant physiology and morphological traits for example when sc is absent plants will break down stored starch to replenish it yuan et al 2015 2016 and they may also adjust their biomass allocation among tissues increasing plant height to obtain more photosynthetic carbon fu et al 2018 yuan et al 2021 this suggests that plant traits are closely related to each other and that a change in one or a few traits will cause a change in the entire ptn connectivity in addition we found significant divergence along nmds2 for both morphological and physiological traits and the ordination of plant traits increased sequentially in nmds2 from the first to the fourth sampling time suggesting that the ammonium pulse effects on plant traits accumulated with increasing pulse duration overall ammonium pulses enhanced the linkage among plant traits which likely help plants to take up and assimilate ammonium and or mitigate the adverse effects of ammonium the response of ptns is strongly related to the pulse pattern magnitude frequency studies on the terrestrial herb poa pratensis l revealed that the plant biomass and tissue nitrogen content were lowest with short and large pulses compared to long and small pulses or continuous supply lamb et al 2012 in our experiment the average diameters of hclf and mcmf were lower and the average degree of mcmf was higher compared with lchf indicating that the large ammonium input led to increased correlation among traits and an increase in the efficiency of resource transfer therefore for some plants high levels of certain nutrients may cause competition for nutrient uptake or physiological stress which in turn is detrimental to plant growth liu et al 2018 tan et al 2019 meanwhile futile transmembrane transport of ammonium consumes large amounts of energy szczerba et al 2008 zhong et al 2013 found that ammonium concentrations above 2 mg l 1 caused damage to the cell membranes of ceratophyllum demersum l and m spicatum increasing membrane permeability ammonium accumulation also produces stress responses of invertase and sucrose synthase activities gao et al 2020 and promotes superoxide dismutase and guaiacol peroxidase activities zhang et al 2010 thus the effect of ammonium pulses on ptn depended on its magnitude and frequency and the impact on ptn was stronger when the ammonium input was greater than the tolerance range of the plants in general submerged macrophytes are capable of maintaining their physiological homeostasis and resist to some extent external disturbances yuan et al 2013 the content of tn in m spicatum and v natans was higher at lchf than at hclf this may be because the small pulse sizes in the present study interfered weakly with the plant ammonium uptake and the plants might therefore have maintained their inherent metabolic rates of nitrogen stability in addition the effects of high and low light on plant traits were relatively small this might be attributed to the low light requirement of the submerged macrophytes su et al 2004 furthermore the pulse effects accumulated during the fifth sampling event in the nh4 n release phase our previous studies also found that a 4 day pulse of a 2 mg l 1 ammonium concentration caused physiological stress in m spicatum and c demersum and that their c n metabolic balance had not been restored on the 10th day after the pulse release but no significant effect on biomass accumulation was observed yuan et al 2015 this may be due to the time lag effect of the ammonium pulse on plant traits especially on morphological traits therefore the ammonium pulse had a cumulative effect meaning that the effect on the plant traits also depended on the duration of the pulses where large and long lasting pulses may be detrimental to the plants plant trait related to biomass allocation i e plant biomass stem ratio leaf ratio and ramet number had the highest degrees in the four networks indicating that they had a stronger correlation with other traits a previous ptn analysis also demonstrated that size traits such as the leaf biomass and below ground biomass were the most central traits in a network based on a dataset including 23 traits from 126 plant species in northwest europe kleyer et al 2019 the physiological traits showed a moderate ptn degree although ammonium pulses have the most direct effect on these traits phenotype related traits e g plant height root length and ab ratio and energy storage related traits e g stem starch had a relatively low degree in the four ptns these may reflect their capacities of physiological regulation phenotypic plasticity and energy storage ultimately influencing biomass accumulation and its allocation the high degree of biomass and physiological traits are consistent with our previous findings of a close relationship between physiological traits and the biomass and distribution of submerged macrophytes along water depth gradients yuan et al 2013 in addition the higher degree of leaf sc and stem sc in the three pulse patterns than in the control concurs with the fact that it is sc that provides the carbon skeleton in the conversion of ammonium to faa gao et al 2020 our study elucidated the high connectivity of biomass related traits in ptn in ammonium pulses rather than the expected physiological traits that are more relevant for ammonium assimilation 4 2 species specific responses to ammonium pulses the ability of plants to capture nitrogen from ammonium pulses is closely related to their inherent metabolic rates such as rgr and assimilation rates yuan et al 2015 and the amount of ammonium uptake from pulses thus varies greatly between species it has previously been found that a high concentration pulse increased the biomass and root mass fraction in exotic plants while native plants showed an opposite response liu et al 2017 in our experiment the three species especially m spicatum benefited from small sized pulses which is consistent with the fact that they are more widely distributed in oligotrophic to mesotrophic lakes than in eutrophic lakes barko 1983 barko et al 1991 studies of terrestrial plants however have shown that the stress tolerant species sarcobatus vermiculatus captured less n from small pulses than from large pulses james and richards 2005 the biomass of the highly invasive japanese knotweed was 2 to 4 fold higher when nutrients were supplied as a large pulse instead of at a constant rate parepa et al 2013 these results are inconsistent with ours probably reflecting that when the magnitude of ammonium pulses exceeds the critical tolerance concentration of the plant this is detrimental to its nutrient uptake and growth performance v natans a resource conservative species is characterised by having low light compensation and a low saturation point relatively low rgr and high nh4 n and light stress tolerance fu et al 2012 su et al 2004 yuan et al 2013 it had the highest modularity and the lowest average degree in our experiment suggesting that it has a more defined functional module of plant traits and performs specific functions a higher modularity of the network usually gives plants more flexibility to cope with unfavorable environments while maintaining normal performance kleyer et al 2019 this allows v natans to be adapted to a wider range of water bodies and substrate types cao et al 2007 for m spicatum and p maackianus the lower modularity and higher degree suggest low functional differentiation but close trait trait correlations thus when external conditions are favourable they are able to grow rapidly and competitively partly explaining why the tn of m spicatum increased significantly in lchf and mcmf pules when light availability is sufficient such as at shallow depth the adequate supply of photosynthetic carbon will facilitate the assimilation of nitrogen for m spicatum and p maackianus concurring with the fact that the two species usually have high dominance at shallow lake depths fu et al 2014 yuan et al 2016 the result of our former study tan et al 2019 based on measured morphological traits such as biomass and ramet number do not correspond fully with the results of the present study we found m spicatum was more capable of capturing ammonium from lchf and v natans was more tolerant to hclf than m spicatum and p maackianus our former study found the response of m spicatum did not differ among the three ammonium pulses hclf having the greatest adverse effect on p maackianus and mcmf on v natans tan et al 2019 this discrepancy probably reflects 1 different time lags between physiological and morphological traits in the pulse responses i e adjustment of physiological traits was faster and easier to determine than morphological traits during a short time period and 2 the pulses led to changes in physiological traits that made the plants more susceptible to environmental changes which does not lead to produce immediate morphological changes taken together the results of ptn indicate that a clear functional differentiation for v natans among the plant traits may improve the ability of the plants to adapt to unfavorable environments and thus have a high ecological amplitude meanwhile the observed stronger trait correlations and a higher resource transfer efficiency for m spicatum and p maackianus may enhance their competitive ability in suitable habitats therefore the ammonium pulse effects on ptn were highly dependent on the intrinsic physiological traits of the individual species 5 conclusions we found that ammonium pulses increased the linkage among plant traits which may enable the plants to take up and assimilate ammonium and or mitigate the toxicity of ammonium given the fact that the toxic effects of high ammonium concentrations and large and low frequency pulses had a stronger negative effect on ptns

15196,extreme precipitation events caused by climate change leads to large variation of nitrogen input to aquatic ecosystems our previous study demonstrated the significant effect of different ammonium pulse patterns differing in magnitude and frequency on submersed macrophyte growth based on six plant morphological traits however how connectivity among plant traits responds to nitrogen pulse changes which in turn affects plant performance has not yet been fully elucidated the response of three common submersed macrophytes myriophyllum spicatum vallisneria natans and potamogeton maackianus to three ammonium pulse patterns was tested using plant trait network ptn analysis based on 18 measured physiological and morphological traits we found that ammonium pulses enhanced trait connectivity in ptn which may enable plants to assimilate ammonium and or mitigate ammonium toxicity large input pulses with low frequency had stronger effects on ptns compared to low input pulses with high frequency due to the cumulative and time lagged effect of the plant response to the ammonium pulse there was a profound and prolonged effect on plant performance after the release of the pulse the highly connected traits in ptn were those related to biomass allocation e g plant biomass stem ratio leaf ratio and ramet number rather than physiological traits while phenotype related traits e g plant height root length and ab ratio and energy storage related traits e g stem starch were least connected v natans showed clear functional divergence among traits making it more flexible to cope with unfavorable habitats i e high input pulses with low frequencies m spicatum with high rgr revealed strong correlations among traits and thus supported nitrogen accumulation from favourable environments i e low input pulses with high frequencies our study highlights the responses of ptn for submerged macrophytes to ammonium pulses depends on their intrinsic metabolic rates the magnitude frequency and duration of the pulses and our results contribute to the understanding of the impact of resource pulses on the population dynamics of submersed macrophytes within the context of global climate change graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords pulse size ammonium pulse plant trait network submerged macrophyte data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction resource pulse is defined as a significant increase in available resources over a short time a phenomenon that is widespread in ecosystems mallon et al 2015 tao et al 2021 weber and brown 2018 in freshwater ecosystems precipitation induced runoff from agricultural systems vegetation deficient areas and urban substrates can markedly increase the nutrient content and decrease the light intensity of water bodies wang et al 2014 yang et al 2008 studies have found that rainfall runoff can increase nitrogen in water bodies substantially fong et al 2020 li et al 2017 generally the magnitude and frequency of such resource pulses are influenced by the intensity and duration of precipitation due to the global climate change extreme precipitation events will occur more frequently in the future which in turn will change resource pulse patterns e g magnitude and frequency brown et al 2022 li et al 2019 wang et al 2022 resource pulses can profoundly affect the morphological and physiological traits of plants altering the correlations between plant traits and driving changes in the composition of plant community structure with far reaching effects on ecosystems fu et al 2022 gratton et al 2017 holt 2008 tan et al 2019 yang et al 2010 however current studies on the effects of resource pulses have mainly focused on terrestrial ecosystems inglima et al 2009 miller et al 2019 tao et al 2021 while the mechanisms affecting plants in freshwater ecosystems are not well elucidated submerged macrophytes are primary producers in aquatic ecosystems playing an important role in purifying water preventing substrate suspension providing spawning and refuge sites for aquatic animals and maintaining lake biodiversity engelhardt and ritchie 2002 han et al 2021 phillips et al 2016 nitrate and ammonium are the main forms of nitrogen available for submerged macrophytes eliašová et al 2021 nelson et al 1981 ammonium however have ambiguous effects appropriate increases in ammonium concentrations would be beneficial for submerged macrophyte growth while excessive increases may cause physiological toxicity cao et al 2007 yuan et al 2015 free nh3 decrease the chlorophyll content gao et al 2019 inhibit respiration and affect the electron transport system of the plants vines and wedding 1960 to prevent nh4 toxicity soluble carbohydrates are consumed to provide the carbon skeleton in the synthesis of nh4 to free amino acids faa resulting in a decrease in soluble carbohydrates and an increase in thee faa content gao et al 2020 yuan et al 2013 low light availability can exacerbate ammonium toxicity due to insufficient photosynthetic carbohydrate supply leading to degradation of submerged macrophytes cao et al 2009 yuan et al 2013 furthermore in consequence of the warming climate the increased concentrations of organic matter due to algal blooms and reduced oxygen content will alter the bacterial community composition of the sediment trigger dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium and increase the ammonium contents in the sediment and the water column gao et al 2022 song et al 2021 zhou et al 2016 the elevated ammonium content and more frequent anaerobic conditions in the sediment will exacerbate carbon depletion and ammonium accumulation in submerged macrophytes especially in their root system marzocchi et al 2019 yuan et al 2015 the effects of ammonium concentrations in the water column on plant traits have been widely studied ochieng et al 2021 yuan et al 2013 2015 whereas only few investigations have focused on the effects of ammonium pulses on submersed macrophyte traits the effect of nitrogen pulses on plant traits i e morphological and physiological traits is closely related to the magnitude and frequency of the ammonium pulses cable et al 2008 davidson et al 2012 li and stevens 2017 given the toxic effects of high ammonium levels we hypothesize that the pulse pattern of high ammonium concentrations with low frequency can severely limit the growth and ammonium assimilation of submerged macrophytes however the effect depends on the intrinsic ability of the plants to capture and assimilate ammonium lamb et al 2012 parepa et al 2019 resource acquiring plants characterised by a high relative growth rate rgr and or high light saturation points generally have a greater ability to capture nitrogen from pulses while resource conserving plants with low rgr and high nutrient storage capacity are expected to be better adapted to unfavorable external environments such as high ammonium conditions frevola and hovick 2019 yuan et al 2013 we therefore hypothesize that submerged macrophytes with high rgr would perform better under pulses with low ammonium concentration while plants with low rgrs would be more tolerant under pulse patterns with high ammonium concentration furthermore plant traits are combined into an efficient trait network through positive or negative feedback regulation and the coordination between traits characterises the trade offs and redistribution of limited resources among plant traits fu et al 2014 he et al 2020 ottaviani et al 2017 current studies of submerged macrophytes however mainly focus on specific tissues e g root stem and leaf and or multiple traits rather than the whole plant frevola and hovick 2019 ochieng et al 2021 yuan et al 2021 a plant trait network ptn analysis can provide information about complex relationships among traits if plant traits are considered as nodes and trait trait relationships as edges multiple traits can be integrated by the relationships used to form a ptn trait trait relationships can be quantified by correlation analyses kleyer et al 2019 rao et al 2021 and the overall plant resistance to changing environments can be evaluated by calculating the topological parameters of the network e g modularity degree and diameter he et al 2020 modularity helps to identify the clustering tendency for traits within a trait network newman 2006 high modularity means that the modules composed of specific traits perform specific functions giving the plants more freedom and flexibility to respond to harsh environments and thus a high ability of stress tolerance flores moreno et al 2019 gilarranz et al 2017 degree can be used to quantify the relative importance of a trait for a given trait network he et al 2020 li et al 2022 and diameter provide information about the strength of the coordination among multiple traits he et al 2020 we can expect that ammonium pulses significantly increase the connectivity between traits as a way to improve assimilation or detoxification of ammonium which in turn affects the plant growth our previous study tested the effects of different ammonium pulse patterns differing in magnitude and frequency on plant growth by measuring six morphological traits i e plant biomass plant height branch number leaf number root length and total branch length of three submersed macrophyte species myriophyllum spicatum l potamogeton maackianus a bennett and vallisneria natans lour hara and the results demonstrated that the effects were species specific and pulse pattern dependent tan et al 2019 however how plants adjust inter trait connectivity to adapt to ammonia pulses changes remains to be elucidated from a whole plant view in fact multiple plant traits respond synergistically to ammonia pulse changes allowing plants to enhance their adaptability to changing environments in the present study we tested the effect of different ammonium pulse patterns on the connectivity among eighteen plant traits by adding ten physiological traits as well as biomass and metabolite allocation among root stem and leaf tissues given the increase in ammonium loading to aquatic ecosystems due to extreme precipitation and the toxic effects of high ammonium on plants ballard et al 2019 ochieng et al 2021 sinha et al 2017 xian et al 2020 zhang et al 2022 we hypothesised that 1 ammonium pulses increase the connectivity between traits in ptn 2 traits closely related to ammonium assimilation have high degree and 3 networks with a high modularity value are more resistant to high ammonium pulses three common submerged macrophytes with different rgrs were selected and plant traits were measured firstly nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds was performed on the basis of the traits to determine the relative influence of treatments on plant performance secondly by calculating the value of parameters i e modularity degree and diameter of ptn the effect of different pulse patterns the same loading but with different magnitude frequency on the ptn was assessed as was the response of different plant traits to resource pulses thirdly mantel analysis was carried out to decipher the relationship between individual traits and the whole plant performance we finally elucidated the mechanisms underlying the response of submerged macrophytes to ammonium pulses based on ptns our results contribute importantly to the understanding of the response of various submersed macrophyte species to a resource pulse 2 materials and methods 2 1 study species three common dominant submerged macrophytes myriophyllum spicatum l vallisneria natans lour hara and potamogeton maackianus a bennett were selected all widely distributed in aquatic ecosystems ranging in state from oligotrophic to mesotrophic in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river in china fu et al 2019 rao et al 2021 the three species have different metabolic rates thus m spicatum has a higher rgr and assimilation rate as well as a higher respiration rate than v natans and p maackianus fu et al 2012 su et al 2004 moreover their growth form varies with m spicatum and p maackianus being canopy formed and v natans rosette formed yuan et al 2016 also their light requirement differ with v natans having significantly lower light compensation and saturation points than the other two species su et al 2004 furthermore many studies have shown that these three species have a high ability to improve the water quality by taking up nutrients and inhibiting the growth of phytoplankton and periphytic algae huang et al 2010 rao et al 2021 and especially v natans is widely used in current lake restoration initiatives in china liu et al 2018 2 2 experimental design the experimental design is described in detail in tan et al 2019 in brief apical shoots of m spicatum and p maackianus and intact plants of v natans were transplanted into 1152 experimental cups diameter 6 0 cm height 7 5 cm total of 384 shoots plants and one shoot plant per cup for both m spicatum and v natans giving a total of 768 shoots and two shoots per cup for p maackianus the plants shoots were placed uniformly in 96 experimental buckets diameter 33 0 cm height 40 0 cm 12 cups in each bucket 32 buckets per species the experiment was divided into two phases nh4 n pulse 16 days phase i and nh4 n release 12 days phase ii within phase i of the nh4 n pulse four nh4 n pulse patterns were applied to the plants hclf high concentration with low frequency 4 mg l 1 nh4 n added to the water column every four days 4 times mcmf moderate concentration with moderate frequency 2 mg l 1 nh4 n every two days lchf low concentration with high frequency 1 mg l 1 nh4 n every day twenty four buckets with no nh4 n loading were used as control during phase ii of the nh4 n release the water in all the buckets was emptied and the buckets were refilled with tap water and the plants were maintained for 12 days see the experimental design fig 1 for details the experimental design included two light treatments hl high light of about 576 umol m 2 s 1 at noon at the surface of the water column ll low light of approximately 288 umol m 2 s 1 at noon at the surface of the water column each treatment combination was replicated four times for each species with 48 shoots plants per treatment for both m spicatum and v natans and 96 shoots for p maackianus as for light intensity the two levels of daylight hl and ll were created by covering the buckets with 1 and 2 layers of black mesh nets respectively the light intensity of hl and ll applied in the present study was equivalent to 50 and 25 sunlight respectively in the water column colonized by natural submerged macrophyte communities tan et al 2019 yuan et al 2021 the concentrations of alkali hydrolysable n available p available k and organic material in the sediments were 0 11 0 03 0 12 and 19 95 mg g 1 respectively the water temperature was 29 8 c 36 9 c during the experiment 2 3 plant trait measurements plant harvest and measurement of selected plant morphological traits plant biomass plant height root length and ramet number were made see also tan et al 2019 during phases i and ii one experimental plant cup was randomly harvested from each bucket every four days and plant morphological and physiological traits were assessed samples were collected four times during phase i and three times during phase ii the morphological traits were plant fresh biomass including shoot root and stolon root fresh biomass g stem fresh biomass g leaf fresh biomass g plant height cm root length cm ramet number and above below ground biomass ratio ab ratio plant height was measured as the distance from the base of the shoot to the apex of the longest leaf tan et al 2019 after measuring morphological characteristics the tissues leaves stems and roots were oven dried at 80 c to a weight to measure c n metabolites the dried tissues of the three species were ground to a fine powder approximately 50 mg of sample powder was extracted twice with 8 ml 80 ethanol at 80 c for 20 min followed by centrifugation at 10 000 x g for 15 min the supernatant was collected decolourised with activated carbon and filtered microvoid membrane φ20mm the filtrate was used for the analysis of soluble carbohydrates sc free amino acids faa no3 n and nh4 n hecht and mohr 1990 meyer 1957 yemm and willis 1954 using glucose and alanine nitrate of potash and ammonium chloride as standards respectively the residue after centrifugation was used for analysis of starch dirk et al 1999 tn total nitrogen and tc total carbon of the plant samples were determined by an elemental analyzer thermo flash 2000 cambridge uk 2 4 plant trait network analysis ptns help clarifying complex relationships among traits and further enable calculation of metrics for the topology of trait coordination and how they shift across treatments a network consists of a series of nodes and edges in ptns plant traits are nodes and trait trait relationships are edges first a matrix of trait trait relationships r was calculated after normalised transformation for 18 plant traits and these relationships were quantified using significant pearson correlations second a threshold of r 0 2 indicated significant correlations among traits at p 0 05 which was used to avoid spurious correlations among traits kleyer et al 2019 rao et al 2021 trait trait correlations below this threshold were assigned as 0 and correlations above this threshold were assigned as 1 an adjacency matrix a a i j with a i j ε 0 1 was estimated thus a only shows the presence and absence of connections between two plant traits he et al 2020 kleyer et al 2019 finally the parameters of ptns were calculated using the package igraph in r he et al 2020 ptns were visualised using cytoscape 3 9 1 kleyer et al 2019 to decipher differences in trait interactions among four pulse patterns and three species ptn analysis was performed and the following three parameters were calculated 1 modularity defined as the fraction of connections among plant traits that falls within a given module minus the same fraction in a random model where trait trait relationships are randomly distributed deng et al 2012 newman 2006 high modularity means that plant traits within modules are closely connected with each other while the connections between modules are weak meaning that the modules composed of specific traits perform specific functions a higher modularity of the network i e more modules or trait dimensions may give plants more freedom and flexibility to respond to unfavorable environments while maintaining a normal performance kleyer et al 2019 2 degree is the number of edges that connect a focal node trait to other nodes the degree value of a specific trait can be calculated according to the following equation he et al 2020 rao et al 2022 k i j i a i j where ki is the degree of the focal node trait i aij is the correlation between the focal node trait i and node trait j aij is the adjacency matrix described above plant traits with a high degree can be considered as hub traits that play an important role in regulating the whole plant phenotype kleyer et al 2019 rao et al 2021 3 diameter is the maximum shortest distance between any two connected node traits in the network and can be calculated according by the following equation he et al 2020 d i m a x d i j i j where di is the diameter value of the focal node trait i dij is the shortest distance between focal node trait i and node trait j diameter describes the coordination among the traits the shorter diameter the stronger is the coordination among the traits and the higher resource utilization efficiency or production efficiency of the plant he et al 2020 2 5 statistical analysis nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds plots displayed the space difference between the three species two light levels four pulse patterns and seven harvest times based on the gower matrix function metamds in the r package vegan of the 672 samples pearson s correlations between plant morphological and physiological traits and chemical properties in the water column were determined by the r package ggcor relationships between whole plant level functions and plant traits and water chemical properties were determined by the mantel test to evaluate the importance of network organization and interaction for whole plant level functions all trait data obtained from four pulse patterns at two light levels for three species were transformed to gower distances these analyses were conducted using the r package vegan one way analysis of variance with duncan s post hoc test was used to compare the differences in mean plant traits among treatments the physiological traits of plants collected during the seven harvest times were analysed by repeated measures anova 3 results 3 1 distribution in plant trait space to visualize differences in the plant trait space among the three species pulse patterns light intensity and harvest times a gower matrix was performed for nmds ordination that was well fitted stress 0 101 r 2 values for the nonlinear and linear regressions were 0 989 and 0 958 respectively on the first axis of the nmds physiological and morphological traits were clearly separated all physiological traits being located in the positive direction of nmds1 on the second axis of the nmds both morphological and physiological traits diverged fig 2 the nmds analysis showed a clear divergence in the response of the three species to the ammonium pulse m spicatum and p maackianus were in the positive zone of nmds1 and p maackianus and v natans were in the positive zone of nmds2 compared to the control all three pulse patterns significantly altered the plant traits the effects of hclf and lchf were the most pronounced followed by mcmf the nmds ordination plot revealed that the high and low light treatments were close together on both axes indicating that light level had a relatively insignificant effect on the response of plant traits to the ammonium pulse fig 2 there was a significant shift in plant traits between sampling times suggesting a time dependent response of plant traits to the ammonium pulse the sequence increased from the first to the fourth sampling event on both axes during phase i of the nh4 n pulse indicating a cumulative effect on plant traits as the pulse duration increased during phase ii of the nh4 n release the sequence from the fifth to the seventh sampling increased on both axes and then decreased indicating that plant traits did not recover immediately after release from the pulse but that plant traits gradually recovered over time fig 2 3 2 plant trait network compared to the control the modularity of the three ammonium pulse patterns decreased with hclf and lchf exhibited the smallest modularity fig 3 indicating that the three pulse patterns resulted in tighter connectivity between modules the three pulse patterns resulted in a significant increase in trait degree fig 3 indicating an increase in the number of connecting edges and a closer correlation among traits compared with lchf the diameters of hclf and mcmf decreased suggesting that the resource transfer efficiency between traits increased plant biomass stem ratio leaf ratio and ramet number had the highest degrees in the four networks fig 4 indicating a stronger correlation with other traits in comparison stem starch ab ratio root length and plant height had relatively low degrees in the networks the degree of leaf and stem physiological traits was medium in terms of degree the degree of sc in leaves and stems was obviously higher for the three pulse patterns than in the control fig 4 among the three species v natans had the highest modularity and the lowest degree fig 5 this indicates that v natans has a higher separation of modules and tighter trait connectivity within the modules than the other two species p maackianus and m spicatum had a lower modularity and average diameter and a higher average degree indicating close trait trait correlations and a high efficiency of resource transfer between traits m spicatum and p maackianus had significantly higher degrees of leaf nh4 n and leaf faa and a lower ab ratio degree than that of v natans fig 6 the three species all had low degrees for stem starch leaf sc and stem sc root starch and sc for v natans the pearson correlation analysis showed a significant negative correlation between plant root and leaf biomass and ramet number with physiological traits in leaves and stems fig 7 leaf physiological traits were positively correlated with stem physiological traits mantel test analysis showed significant relationships between whole plant performance with each plant trait p 0 01 fig 7 with mantel r values being higher than 0 5 for plant root and leaf biomass and ramet number whole plant performance was significantly related p 0 05 to all five chemical indicators in the water column 3 3 changes in plant traits for v natans the three ammonium pulse patterns increased the nh4 n and faa contents during the nh4 n pulse phase and decreased the sc content while the starch and no3 n contents did not differ fig s1 s4 however during the nh4 n release phase there were no significant differences in the nh4 n and faa contents between the three pulse patterns and the control for m spicatum the three ammonium pulse patterns resulted in an increase in the contents of nh4 n faa starch and no3 n compared to the control during the nh4 n pulse phase while there was no significant difference in sc fig s2 s5 during the nh4 n release phase nh4 n and faa were still higher and sc lower at high light compared to the control for p maackianus the three pulse patterns increased the nh4 n faa and starch contents at both light levels during the nh4 n pulse phase while the sc content decreased and the no3 n content increased at high light level fig s3 s6 during the nh4 n release phase sc was lower for the three pulse patterns than in the control while there were no differences in nh4 n faa starch and no3 n the three pulse patterns resulted in a significant increase in both leaf tn and stem tn compared to the control fig 8 for m spicatum the highest increase in tn was observed in lchf followed by mcmf and the lowest in hclf v natans also showed the same increasing trend as m spicatum for the three pulse patterns there was no significant difference in tn among the three pulse patterns for p maackianus for the three species there were no significant differences in leaf tc between the three pulse patterns and the control group stem tc in hclf was significantly lower for m spicatum and significantly higher for p maackianus at high light compared to the control 4 discussion extreme precipitation events are likely to change the pattern magnitude and frequency of ammonium pulses in lakes which in turn may impact the physiology and morphological traits of plants ptn analysis is a useful tool for assessing effects of ammonium pulse patterns on plant traits from a whole plant perspective we found that 1 ammonium pulse effects depended on the magnitude frequency and duration of the pulses and were species specific 2 the three pulse patterns had marked impacts on the ptns with tighter connectivity among traits than that in the control 3 resource conserving species i e v natans exhibited more distinct functional differentiation across traits enabling higher adaptability of plants to a wide range of unfavorable environments overall the ammonium pulse had a profound influence on the plant trait network which subsequently affected the plant growth performance 4 1 divergence in the effects of different pulse patterns on ptn the ammonium pulses led to increased inter module connectivity and closer correlation between traits as we found a decrease in the modularity of ptn and an increase in average degree which may accelerate the uptake and or assimilation of ammonium in the water column positive or negative correlations between traits are usually considered to be trade offs of synergistic optimization or allocation of the limited resources among tissues traits based on biochemical and or physiological needs moreover the supply of carbon affects the response of plants to nitrogen for example the conversion from ammonium to faa requires provision of a carbon skeleton cao et al 2011 and plants actively remove the ammonium entering cells at an uncontrolled rate to reduce ammonium toxicity which leads to a high carbohydrate consumption britto et al 2001 this in turn affects the overall carbon allocation of the plant leading to adjustments of plant physiology and morphological traits for example when sc is absent plants will break down stored starch to replenish it yuan et al 2015 2016 and they may also adjust their biomass allocation among tissues increasing plant height to obtain more photosynthetic carbon fu et al 2018 yuan et al 2021 this suggests that plant traits are closely related to each other and that a change in one or a few traits will cause a change in the entire ptn connectivity in addition we found significant divergence along nmds2 for both morphological and physiological traits and the ordination of plant traits increased sequentially in nmds2 from the first to the fourth sampling time suggesting that the ammonium pulse effects on plant traits accumulated with increasing pulse duration overall ammonium pulses enhanced the linkage among plant traits which likely help plants to take up and assimilate ammonium and or mitigate the adverse effects of ammonium the response of ptns is strongly related to the pulse pattern magnitude frequency studies on the terrestrial herb poa pratensis l revealed that the plant biomass and tissue nitrogen content were lowest with short and large pulses compared to long and small pulses or continuous supply lamb et al 2012 in our experiment the average diameters of hclf and mcmf were lower and the average degree of mcmf was higher compared with lchf indicating that the large ammonium input led to increased correlation among traits and an increase in the efficiency of resource transfer therefore for some plants high levels of certain nutrients may cause competition for nutrient uptake or physiological stress which in turn is detrimental to plant growth liu et al 2018 tan et al 2019 meanwhile futile transmembrane transport of ammonium consumes large amounts of energy szczerba et al 2008 zhong et al 2013 found that ammonium concentrations above 2 mg l 1 caused damage to the cell membranes of ceratophyllum demersum l and m spicatum increasing membrane permeability ammonium accumulation also produces stress responses of invertase and sucrose synthase activities gao et al 2020 and promotes superoxide dismutase and guaiacol peroxidase activities zhang et al 2010 thus the effect of ammonium pulses on ptn depended on its magnitude and frequency and the impact on ptn was stronger when the ammonium input was greater than the tolerance range of the plants in general submerged macrophytes are capable of maintaining their physiological homeostasis and resist to some extent external disturbances yuan et al 2013 the content of tn in m spicatum and v natans was higher at lchf than at hclf this may be because the small pulse sizes in the present study interfered weakly with the plant ammonium uptake and the plants might therefore have maintained their inherent metabolic rates of nitrogen stability in addition the effects of high and low light on plant traits were relatively small this might be attributed to the low light requirement of the submerged macrophytes su et al 2004 furthermore the pulse effects accumulated during the fifth sampling event in the nh4 n release phase our previous studies also found that a 4 day pulse of a 2 mg l 1 ammonium concentration caused physiological stress in m spicatum and c demersum and that their c n metabolic balance had not been restored on the 10th day after the pulse release but no significant effect on biomass accumulation was observed yuan et al 2015 this may be due to the time lag effect of the ammonium pulse on plant traits especially on morphological traits therefore the ammonium pulse had a cumulative effect meaning that the effect on the plant traits also depended on the duration of the pulses where large and long lasting pulses may be detrimental to the plants plant trait related to biomass allocation i e plant biomass stem ratio leaf ratio and ramet number had the highest degrees in the four networks indicating that they had a stronger correlation with other traits a previous ptn analysis also demonstrated that size traits such as the leaf biomass and below ground biomass were the most central traits in a network based on a dataset including 23 traits from 126 plant species in northwest europe kleyer et al 2019 the physiological traits showed a moderate ptn degree although ammonium pulses have the most direct effect on these traits phenotype related traits e g plant height root length and ab ratio and energy storage related traits e g stem starch had a relatively low degree in the four ptns these may reflect their capacities of physiological regulation phenotypic plasticity and energy storage ultimately influencing biomass accumulation and its allocation the high degree of biomass and physiological traits are consistent with our previous findings of a close relationship between physiological traits and the biomass and distribution of submerged macrophytes along water depth gradients yuan et al 2013 in addition the higher degree of leaf sc and stem sc in the three pulse patterns than in the control concurs with the fact that it is sc that provides the carbon skeleton in the conversion of ammonium to faa gao et al 2020 our study elucidated the high connectivity of biomass related traits in ptn in ammonium pulses rather than the expected physiological traits that are more relevant for ammonium assimilation 4 2 species specific responses to ammonium pulses the ability of plants to capture nitrogen from ammonium pulses is closely related to their inherent metabolic rates such as rgr and assimilation rates yuan et al 2015 and the amount of ammonium uptake from pulses thus varies greatly between species it has previously been found that a high concentration pulse increased the biomass and root mass fraction in exotic plants while native plants showed an opposite response liu et al 2017 in our experiment the three species especially m spicatum benefited from small sized pulses which is consistent with the fact that they are more widely distributed in oligotrophic to mesotrophic lakes than in eutrophic lakes barko 1983 barko et al 1991 studies of terrestrial plants however have shown that the stress tolerant species sarcobatus vermiculatus captured less n from small pulses than from large pulses james and richards 2005 the biomass of the highly invasive japanese knotweed was 2 to 4 fold higher when nutrients were supplied as a large pulse instead of at a constant rate parepa et al 2013 these results are inconsistent with ours probably reflecting that when the magnitude of ammonium pulses exceeds the critical tolerance concentration of the plant this is detrimental to its nutrient uptake and growth performance v natans a resource conservative species is characterised by having low light compensation and a low saturation point relatively low rgr and high nh4 n and light stress tolerance fu et al 2012 su et al 2004 yuan et al 2013 it had the highest modularity and the lowest average degree in our experiment suggesting that it has a more defined functional module of plant traits and performs specific functions a higher modularity of the network usually gives plants more flexibility to cope with unfavorable environments while maintaining normal performance kleyer et al 2019 this allows v natans to be adapted to a wider range of water bodies and substrate types cao et al 2007 for m spicatum and p maackianus the lower modularity and higher degree suggest low functional differentiation but close trait trait correlations thus when external conditions are favourable they are able to grow rapidly and competitively partly explaining why the tn of m spicatum increased significantly in lchf and mcmf pules when light availability is sufficient such as at shallow depth the adequate supply of photosynthetic carbon will facilitate the assimilation of nitrogen for m spicatum and p maackianus concurring with the fact that the two species usually have high dominance at shallow lake depths fu et al 2014 yuan et al 2016 the result of our former study tan et al 2019 based on measured morphological traits such as biomass and ramet number do not correspond fully with the results of the present study we found m spicatum was more capable of capturing ammonium from lchf and v natans was more tolerant to hclf than m spicatum and p maackianus our former study found the response of m spicatum did not differ among the three ammonium pulses hclf having the greatest adverse effect on p maackianus and mcmf on v natans tan et al 2019 this discrepancy probably reflects 1 different time lags between physiological and morphological traits in the pulse responses i e adjustment of physiological traits was faster and easier to determine than morphological traits during a short time period and 2 the pulses led to changes in physiological traits that made the plants more susceptible to environmental changes which does not lead to produce immediate morphological changes taken together the results of ptn indicate that a clear functional differentiation for v natans among the plant traits may improve the ability of the plants to adapt to unfavorable environments and thus have a high ecological amplitude meanwhile the observed stronger trait correlations and a higher resource transfer efficiency for m spicatum and p maackianus may enhance their competitive ability in suitable habitats therefore the ammonium pulse effects on ptn were highly dependent on the intrinsic physiological traits of the individual species 5 conclusions we found that ammonium pulses increased the linkage among plant traits which may enable the plants to take up and assimilate ammonium and or mitigate the toxicity of ammonium given the fact that the toxic effects of high ammonium concentrations and large and low frequency pulses had a stronger negative effect on ptns ammonium pulses had cumulative and time lagged effects on plant physiological and morphological traits implying far reaching effects on plant performance after the pulse release the stress tolerant species v natans benefited from their higher functional differentiation of traits making them more flexible to cope with various adverse environments the resource acquiring m spicatum had a greater correlation between traits and resource transfer efficiency making it more efficient at capturing ammonium from favourable environments i e small pulses with high frequencies our findings highlighted that ammonium pulses altered the connectivity of ptn which in turn affected plant growth performance this pulse effect depended on the magnitude frequency and duration of the pulse and varied between

15197,waterborne fungi pose a potential threat to water supply safety due to their high resistance to disinfectants peracetic acid as a promising alternative disinfectant to chlorine has attracted increasing attention in water treatment in this study the inactivation of two dominant fungal species aspergillus niger and aspergillus flavus by sequential application of peracetic acid and ultraviolet paa uv paa was reported for the first time results revealed that the pre exposure of paa could facilitate the subsequent process of uv paa combination and shorten the lag phase in fungi inactivation after 10 min of paa pre exposure paa uv paa achieved 3 03 and 2 40 log inactivation of aspergillus niger and aspergillus flavus which were 2 and 4 3 fold higher than that of direct uv paa under the same uv and paa doses paa uv paa disinfection also exhibited a stronger regrowth inhibition for incompletely inactivated fungal spores than direct uv paa the increase of ph 5 0 9 0 and humic acid concentration 1 0 5 0 mg l 1 showed an inhibitory effect on paa uv paa inactivation but paa uv paa was more adaptable in a wide ph range and the presence of humic acid compared to direct uv paa the more severe cell membrane damage and higher reactive oxygen species level in paa uv paa were evidenced for the first time by flow cytometry the increased hydroxyl radical generation and higher synergism were primarily responsible for inactivation improvement this study enhances the further understanding of the paa uv paa process and the findings are expected to promote the development of paa as a promising disinfectant for effective fungi control graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords peracetic acid ultraviolet fungal spores pre exposure sequential application data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the proliferation of waterborne fungi is an emerging concern to ecosystems and humans aspergillus species are ubiquitous filamentous fungi commonly found in various aquatic environments such as rivers reservoirs and distribution systems wen et al 2017a several species of aspergillus mainly aspergillus niger a niger aspergillus flavus a flavus and aspergillus fumigatus have been reported as potential pathogenic species pereira et al 2009 the presence of fungi can produce unpleasant smells tastes turbidity oliveira et al 2013 and release mycotoxins that may cause health problems such as hypersensitivity pneumonitis skin infection and sinusitis curtis et al 2004 hageskal et al 2009 wen et al 2017b traditional disinfectants including chlorine chloramine and ozone have been used for fungi inactivation in waterworks among which chlorine based disinfectants are most widely used due to their low cost ma and bibby 2017 wen et al 2020b however the formation of halogenated disinfection by products dbps like trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas by chlorine based disinfectants is unexpected uv technology has also been applied for the fungi control but studies showed that fungi exhibited resistance to uv irradiation due to the conidial protection mechanisms oliveira et al 2020 therefore the alternative disinfectants are urgently needed to address the fungi propagation in water sun et al 2018 peracetic acid paa ch3c o ooh a promising oxidant and disinfectant with high redox e0 paa 1 06 1 96 v and good biocidal effect has gained increasing attention in the municipal water and wastewater treatment cai et al 2017 lin et al 2021 wang et al 2020a compared with traditional chlorine based disinfection paa has less potential to form toxic dbps and is therefore considered a green alternative to chlorine chen et al 2019 wang et al 2020b to date an increasing number of studies on the degradation of micropollutants by paa based advanced oxidation processes have been reported but there are still few studies on the disinfection of pathogenic microorganisms ao et al 2021 among them uv paa is the most commonly used method to inactivate the pathogen efficiently under uv irradiation hydroxyl radical oh and organic radicals ro such as acetoxyl radical ch3co2 and acetylperoxy radical ch3co3 are generated through the cleavage of oo bond in paa molecular resulting in oxidative damage to the proteins lipids and nucleic acids of microorganisms cai et al 2017 chen et al 2019 owing to the larger and more complex cellular structures of eukaryotic fungi that differ from prokaryotic bacteria fungal spores are usually more challenging to be inactivated rangel et al 2018 xia et al 2022 the pigments in fungal cell walls may also play a protective role wen et al 2017b a niger and a flavus are two representative pathogenic fungi and have been reported to produce melanin to protect them against chlorine based disinfectants xu et al 2022a we have previously studied the inactivation of a niger and a flavus by paa alone and uv paa but results showed that the application of paa for inactivating fungi still had some limitations xu et al 2022b zuo et al 2022 paa alone treatment was less effective in inactivating fungi than chlorine it required a high dose of paa and showed a delay in inactivating a flavus zuo et al 2022 the uv paa process also required a high uv dose to inactivate fungal spores it took 7 min of uv irradiation to achieve 2 25 log inactivation of a niger when the paa dose was 7 mg l 1 and uv irradiance was 0 12 mw cm 2 xu et al 2022b the associated dosing expense and energy cost may limit the practical application of paa disinfectant for fungi control recently sun and zhang et al proposed an innovative disinfection strategy in which paa and uv were applied sequentially i e paa uv paa to enhance the inactivation of bacteria sun et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 specifically by pre exposing escherichia coli e coli to paa for 2 min and then applying uv for 1 min paa uv paa achieved an additional 4 7 5 4 log inactivation compared to direct uv paa under the same uv and paa doses zhang et al 2020 their studies provided us with new insights we were inspired to explore whether this shift from simultaneous combination uv paa to sequential combination paa uv paa can overcome the difficulties of inefficiencies and delay phenomenon encountered in our previous work on resistant fungi it is also meaningful and essential to examine the applicability of paa uv paa process in different microorganisms in addition there is much further work that can be done on this novel strategy firstly the residual acetic acid after paa disinfection may cause the pathogen regrowth zhang et al 2019 which would lead to the release of toxic metabolites that threaten the drinking water supplies zhang et al has reported that no appreciable regrowth of bacteria was observed within 24 h after complete inactivation close to or below the detection limit by paa uv paa zhang et al 2020 but for the more resistant fungi monitoring of the regrowth potential should be performed for a longer period of time the risk of regrowth of incompletely inactivated spores is also noteworthy meanwhile it is necessary to evaluate the effects of operating parameter and water matrices on paa uv paa inactivation the paa pre exposure time is crucial to the high inactivation efficiency of paa uv paa zhang et al 2020 solution ph is another critical factor in paa based processes because it affects the chemistry of radicals oxidants and target objects ao et al 2021 humic acid ha as a representative of natural organic matter nom may also affect the applicability of the process in natural water matrices chen et al 2019 these influencing factors are important to evaluate whether paa uv paa is a viable strategy for fungal control in real water treatment plants furthermore the mechanism of paa uv paa is worthy of further study the additional perspectives such as morphological and physiological changes in microorganisms the membrane integrity and intracellular reactive oxygen species ros level can also be used to elucidate the mechanism of the enhanced efficiency finally a more comprehensive comparison of paa uv paa and direct uv paa should be conducted for better understanding the effect of paa pre exposure on the subsequent uv paa process hence based on the discussion above this study aimed to 1 investigate the inactivation effect of paa uv paa on resistant fungi 2 monitor the long term regrowth potential of fungal spores after different degrees of paa uv paa inactivation 3 evaluate the influence of paa pre exposure time ph value and ha concentration on the inactivation 4 systematically elucidate the mechanisms of the enhanced inactivation of fungi by paa uv paa including the changes of membrane integrity intracellular ros level radical production and contribution of different mechanisms to the overall inactivation 5 provide a comprehensive comparison of paa uv paa and direct uv paa processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 fungal spores and reagents two representative fungal species a niger and a flavus were chosen in this study because they were the dominant pathogenic fungi isolated from groundwater source in northwest china and were reported to be highly resistant to disinfectants xu et al 2022a the detailed preparation method of spores stock solution was given in text s1 in the supplementary materials zuo et al 2022 peracetic acid around 17 6 paa 9 8 h2o2 by weight was obtained from sinopharm chemical reagent shanghai china the concentration of paa solution was measured using the n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd spectrophotometry method sun et al 2018 details of other chemical reagents were provided in text s2 2 2 experimental procedures 2 2 1 inactivation experiments the inactivation experiments were conducted in a collimated beam photoreactor as previously described wen et al 2017b the average uv254 fluence rate was determined to be 0 120 mw cm 2 by iodide iodate chemical actinometry rahn et al 2006 the uv lamp was warmed up for 30 min before experiments to guarantee the stability of photons output the paa uv paa inactivation experiments were conducted in the petri dishes which contained 100 ml phosphate buffer solution pbs 10 mm at ph 7 0 the fungal spore stock solution was diluted to achieve an initial concentration of 2 5 105 cfu ml 1 which was a concentration commonly used in the study of fungi disinfection al gabr et al 2013 xu et al 2022b firstly 7 mg l 1 of paa solution was added to the petri dish under dark condition to initiate the paa pre exposure reaction after the scheduled pre exposure intervals the uv irradiation was applied the solution was mixed with continuous magnetic stirring during the whole process the paa concentration was measured during the reaction fig s1 afterward aliquots 1 ml were sampled at selected uv irradiation timepoints and promptly spiked with excess sodium thiosulfate na2s2o3 paa 0 5 to quench the residual paa cai et al 2017 the concentration of fungal spores was measured by the heterotrophic plate count hpc method wen et al 2020b the samples were diluted and plated on dichloran rose bengal chloramphenicol drbc agar in triplicate and the plates were incubated in dark at 28 c for 2 3 days then the numbers of fungi colonies cfu ml 1 were counted the inactivation under uv paa and uv paa were performed separately for comparison with paa uv paa details were provided in text s3 the effect of pre exposure time 0 min 10 0 min initial ph 5 0 9 0 and ha concentration 0 5 0 mg l 1 were also investigated each experiment was repeated at least three times at 25 c and the results were reported as mean standard deviation of replicates 2 2 2 regrowth potential tests the regrowth experiments were performed after the different degrees of paa uv paa and uv paa inactivation different treatment times were applied for the fungal spores to achieve 1 log 2 log 3 log and complete inactivation below the detection limit 10 cfu ml 1 after treatment the residual paa was quenched by na2s2o3 after inactivation the regrowth potential was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 520 nm od520 every 4 h using a microplate reader varioskan flash thermo scientific usa luo et al 2021 50 μl of the inactivated spore suspension and 150 μl of r2a broth duan et al 2020 simões et al 2015 the compositions were displayed in table s1 were uniform mixed and added to the 96 well microplate as previously documented zuo et al 2022 then the mixture was cultured at suitable light and temperature parallel samples were performed in sextuplicate for the control experiments spores without inactivated in r2a medium spores without inactivated and completely inactivated in pbs were also conducted 2 3 mechanism analysis the cell membrane integrity was evaluated by flow cytometer fcm accuri c6 bd usa combined with sybr green і propidium iodide sg pi dye and intracellular reactive oxygen species ros was evaluated by fcm combined with dihydroethidium dhe dye as previously reported cao et al 2021 wen et al 2020a the spores after heating treatment 70 c for 15 min were used as positive controls to define the spores with damaged membrane and high ros level quenching experiments were conducted under the same procedures as the inactivation experiments but added excess 10 mm tert butyl alcohol tba at the beginning of the reactions kim et al 2019 li et al 2021 the 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo was used as a spin trapping agent for electron paramagnetic resonance epr measurement on an emxmicro 6 1 epr spectrometer bruker germany chen et al 2021 wan et al 2022 the contribution of multiple mechanisms involved were also analyzed referring to the previous study zhang et al 2020 details of fcm analysis and epr procedures were given in text s4 2 4 data analysis and kinetic modeling the log reduction of fungal spores after inactivation was described by eq 1 1 n log n n 0 where n represents the value of log inactivation n0 and n denote the viable fungal spores cfu ml 1 before and after inactivation in the inactivation curves of fungi the phenomenon of initial shoulder lag phases before the linear decay exists in some processes and species this may be related to the protection from the complex structure pigments in cell wall and outer surface aggregation of fungal spores berthelot et al 2020 bowman and free 2006 in order to modify the deviations of classic linear model geeraerd and van impe model fitting tool ginafit was utilized in this study to calculate the inactivation rate constants k berney et al 2006 geeraerd et al 2005 based on the shapes of inactivation curves the log linear regression model eq 2 and log linear regression plus shoulder model eq 3 were chosen to describe the inactivation 2 n n 0 e k max t 3 n n 0 e k max t e k max sl 1 e k max sl 1 e k max t where n0 and n are the number of colonies cfu ml 1 before and after inactivation k max is the maximum inactivation rate constant min 1 t is the reaction time min and sl is the shoulder length min the goodness of fit was evaluated using the correlation coefficient r2 3 results and discussion 3 1 inactivation of fungal spores by paa uv uv paa and paa uv paa paa uv and uv paa inactivation were conducted individually to compare with paa uv paa as depicted in fig 1 the ginafit tools was used to calculated the inactivation rate constants k of a niger and a flavus in different processes according to the shapes of inactivation curves and the maximum values of r2 the inactivation of a niger by uv uv paa and paa uv paa processes fitted well with the log linear regression plus shoulder model while the paa alone fitted well with the log linear regression model the inactivation of a flavus by four processes all fitted well with the log linear regression plus shoulder model the difference in model for paa alone inactivation was consistent with our previous study suggesting that a flavus was more resistant to paa disinfection than a niger zuo et al 2022 as shown in fig s2 the k values of the two fungal spores in the four processes followed the order of k paa uv paa k uv paa k uv k paa the results showed that paa uv paa exhibited the best inactivation performance compared to uv paa and uv paa besides as presented in fig 1 the paa uv paa and uv paa could be further compared in terms of reaction time after 10 min of paa pre exposure a niger was inactivated to 2 96 log after 5 5 min reaction by subsequent uv paa while the same log inactivation under direct uv paa required more than 8 3 min between 8 3 and 9 7 min although the total time of the same log inactivation under direct uv paa was shorter than paa uv paa 15 5 min the uv doses needed for paa uv paa 40 mj cm 2 was less than uv paa more than 60 mj cm 2 a similar phenomenon could also be seen in the inactivation of a flavus results showed that paa uv paa could reduce the uv input by nearly one third less than direct uv paa in addition according to the previous research the synergistic factor sf calculated by eqs 4 5 could also be used to compare the inactivation under paa uv paa and uv paa marjanovic et al 2018 4 s f uv paa k uv paa k uv k paa 5 s f paa uv paa k paa uv paa k uv k paa as shown in fig s3 the sf of uv paa and paa uv paa were 1 54 and 2 46 for a niger and were 1 28 and 1 82 for a flavus respectively the result further demonstrated the higher inactivation efficiency in paa uv paa than in direct uv paa the high inactivation efficiency of paa uv paa was attributed to the diffusion of paa in the study of zhang et al fluorescence microscopy method has directly evidenced the diffusion of paa into the e coli cells which allowed more uv activating paa to occur within the cells resulting in severe cells damages zhang et al 2020 a previous study showed that the inactivation of e coli by h2o2 uv h2o2 did not show an enhanced effect like paa uv paa implying that the diffusion property of paa was unique sun et al 2018 compared with direct uv paa paa uv paa further prolonged the time of paa diffusion which significantly improved the subsequent uv paa inactivation 3 2 regrowth potential of fungi after varying degrees of inactivation to evaluate the long term inactivation effect and safety of paa uv paa process the monitoring of regrowth potential was conducted for 120 h as illustrated in fig 2 the fungal spores after different degrees of inactivation by paa uv paa and uv paa were compared no appreciable regrowth of fungal spores was observed after 3 log and complete inactivation by both paa uv paa and uv paa this was consistent with the previous report showing no observed regrowth for bacteria within 24 h after complete inactivation by paa uv paa and uv paa zhang et al 2020 however after 1 log and 2 log inactivation the regrowth potential showed a difference the results indicated that paa uv paa exhibited better inhibition of regrowth of incompletely inactivated fungi than direct uv paa the possible reason for regrowth was that the acetic acid in paa solution could act as carbon source for microbial survival sun et al 2018 since fungi have been reported to be highly resistant to disinfectants xia et al 2022 there may be more risk of incomplete inactivation during the actual inactivation process the superiority of paa uv paa suggested that the pre exposure of paa seemed to be important for effective inhibition of regrowth of fungi the conclusion further proved that paa uv paa had good application prospects in the inactivation of recalcitrant fungal spores 3 3 effects of operating parameter and water matrices on inactivation 3 3 1 effect of paa pre exposure time to further disclose the influence of paa pre exposure time on the inactivation a niger and a flavus spores were pre exposed to paa for different times 0 5 0 and 10 0 min and then treated with combined uv irradiation as shown in fig 3 a and fig 3 b the lag phase during the uv paa stage was shortened with longer paa pre exposure times which was particularly significant for a flavus the k of the uv paa stage for a niger and a flavus increased from 0 96 to 1 49 min 1 and from 1 17 to 1 67 min 1 respectively fig s4 as shown in fig 3 c and fig 3 d the log inactivation by subsequent uv paa stage was increased with the prolongation of paa pre exposure time after 10 min of paa pre exposure the overall log inactivation of a niger nearly doubled from 1 50 log to 3 03 log and a flavus increased over 4 fold from 0 56 log to 2 40 log evidently the results suggested that the longer paa pre exposure time led to a better fungi inactivation during the subsequent uv paa shortened the lag phase and brought higher efficiency of the overall inactivation by paa uv paa this conclusion was in agreement with the results presented by zhang and cao et al for the inactivation of bacteria and algae by paa uv paa cao et al 2022 sun et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 different from chlorine based disinfectants which mainly destroy the outer cellular structures paa kills the microorganisms primarily by penetrating cells and producing reactive radical species inside the cells zhang et al 2019 in a study dealing with bacterial biofilms chlorine was more effective than paa within a short contact time 5 10 min but paa gradually performed better than chlorine after a longer contact time 50 min park et al 2012 cao et al also demonstrated that paa contact time rather than paa dose was more critical to uv paa inactivation through kinetic calculation cao et al 2022 accordingly the sufficient diffusion of paa was crucial in paa based disinfection 3 3 2 effect of initial ph to determine the influence of ph on paa uv paa process experiments at different ph values 5 0 7 0 and 9 0 were carried out fig s5 to fig s7 as shown in fig 4 the k of uv paa stage in paa uv paa process decreased as the ph increased from 5 0 to 9 0 the k values fell from 1 59 min 1 to 1 17 min 1 for a niger and from 1 77 min 1 to 1 04 min 1 for a flavus according to the previous studies several factors together resulted in the inhibition firstly the pka of paa is 8 2 owing to the oxidation capacity of deprotonated paa paa is weaker than that of neutral paa paa0 the inactivation efficiency is weakened with increasing ph wang et al 2020a wang et al 2020b meanwhile the molar absorption coefficient of paa is higher than paa0 thus the photolysis of paa is faster than paa0 in alkaline conditions ao et al 2021 furthermore increased ph can make the surface of fungal spores more negatively charged the stronger electrostatic repulsion between paa and cells further decreases the inactivation efficiency zuo et al 2022 compared to direct uv paa process the paa uv paa process could achieve higher inactivation efficiency under all three conditions and exhibit remarkable ph tolerant performance in addition it was surprisingly found that ph impacted the two processes in a sort of different way specifically for direct uv paa process the inactivation efficiency at ph 5 0 was relatively close to that at ph 7 0 while the apparent decrease appeared when ph increased to 9 0 fig s6 similar results were also found in the study of baldry et al which investigated the inactivation of bacteria with paa baldry et al 1991 however for paa uv paa process the inactivation efficiency gradually decreased with the increasing ph and the difference could be seen between ph 5 0 and 7 0 fig s5 the possible reason for this discrepancy was that in the uv paa process the protonation deprotonation of paa was a main factor affected by ph changes kim et al 2019 while in the paa uv paa process previous research reported that the solubility of cellular components such as protein might be influenced by the solution ph amiri et al 2010 the surface characteristic of microorganisms could also become an important ph related factors due to the influence on penetrating performance of paa therefore unlike with ph 8 2 as the threshold in uv paa process there was difference between acid and neutral condition in paa uv paa process 3 3 3 effect of ha concentration the effect of nom on the inactivation of fungi by paa uv paa was tested by adding different concentrations of ha and the results were compared with uv paa fig s8 to fig s10 as illustrated in fig 5 ha displayed a negative impact on fungi inactivation in paa uv paa similar observations were also reported in previous studies on inactivation of algae and fungi by uv paa process cao et al 2022 xu et al 2022b the k of a niger and a flavus in the uv paa stage of paa uv paa process decreased by 44 5 and 34 5 respectively previous studies reported that the inhibition effect of ha on uv paa based inactivation efficiency was mainly ascribed to the two following factors owing to the large absorbance of ha the competition of ha for uv photons may affect the paa photolysis chen et al 2019 besides ha has a high scavenging capacity for ro and oh reducing the concentration of radicals in the system cao et al 2022 the comparison between paa uv paa and uv paa showed that although both processes were gradually inhibited with the increasing ha concentration the paa uv paa exhibited better performance than direct uv paa under the same ha concentration the results implied that the pre exposure of paa could alleviate the inhibition effect of ha on fungi inactivation by uv paa a latest study by zhang et al also demonstrated that the inactivation of e coli by paa uv paa showed a stable performance in produce wash water with high organic content and the inactivation was negligibly affected by the uv light shielding zhang et al 2022 accordingly in waters containing a high concentration of nom paa pre exposure could be applied before the uv paa process to obtain better inactivation efficiency of fungi 3 4 inactivation mechanisms 3 4 1 membrane integrity the cell membrane integrity was evaluated by fcm combined sg pi dye according to our previous study wen et al 2020a with results shown in fig 6 and fig s11 the percentage of spores with intact membrane in uv paa and paa uv paa was comparable before the uv irradiation started 0 min in figures suggesting the limited impact of 10 min of 7 mg l 1 paa pre exposure on spore membrane zhang et al also demonstrated that 120 μm paa entered the e coli cells within 5 min by diffusion while maintaining the integrity of most of the membrane zhang et al 2020 after the combination of uv irradiation both uv paa and paa uv paa inactivation exhibited a negative effect on membrane integrity over time however paa uv paa caused more significant damage to the membrane during the subsequent uv paa stage compared to direct uv paa the percentage of a niger spores with intact membrane decreased by 21 5 and 45 1 after direct uv paa and paa uv paa after 5 5 min of uv irradiation and for a flavus spores it decreased by 14 3 and 35 respectively the aggravated membrane damage in the uv paa stage was probably due to the accumulation of oxidative stress inside the cells sun et al evaluated the location of oh production in paa uv paa process and found that paa diffusion allowed oh to be produced inside the cells therefore showed a strong disinfection power sun et al 2018 in general the results showed that paa uv paa performed more distinct damage to the cell membrane compared to direct uv paa and the membrane damage predominantly occurred in the uv paa stage rather than the paa pre exposure stage besides microorganisms after disinfection may undergo an intermediate state as viable but non culturable vbnc which is hardly detectable by hpc method but can be determined by fcm analysis kong et al 2015 phe et al 2005 hence the hpc method was also conducted to compare with fcm to evaluate the fungal spore viability as shown in fig 6 the higher percentage of viable cells was observed by fcm analysis the red lines than by hpc method the black lines indicating the presence of vbnc cells wen et al 2020b after the inactivation by paa uv paa and uv paa the percentage of vbnc cells was 35 2 and 58 0 for a niger and 47 5 and 52 3 for a flavus respectively the results showed that paa uv paa had less induction of the vbnc state than direct uv paa 3 4 2 intracellular ros level intracellular ros is formed during the cellular metabolic process and can serve as a critical indicator of oxidative stress gessler et al 2007 the changes in ros of the two fungal spores were measured by fcm combined dhe dye using the method previously described cao et al 2021 with results shown in fig 6 and fig s12 the difference between uv paa and paa uv paa was relatively inconspicuous before the uv irradiation started 0 min in figures the result was in agreement with our previous study the change of ros level of fungi was unapparent after paa alone zuo et al 2022 after the introduction of uv an increase in the proportion of spores with high ros level was observed in both uv paa and paa uv paa processes however a more significant rise of intracellular ros level was observed in paa uv paa compared to direct uv paa after uv paa and paa uv paa treatments the percentage of a niger with high ros level increased by 30 5 and 49 5 and that of a flavus increased by 19 6 and 86 9 respectively the remarkable ros increase of a flavus provided direct evidence to the result in section 3 3 1 that the inactivation of a flavus could be sharply improved after paa pre exposure the higher ros level in paa uv paa could be elucidated by the following aspects increasing intracellular paa and h2o2 made the direct oxidation and uv photolysis simultaneously occur inside the cells to exhibit more intense oxidative stress zhang et al 2020 the radicals chain reactions were accelerated to produce more radicals for indirect oxidation increasing the ros level cai et al 2017 cao et al 2022 the catalase enzyme might be inactivated by intracellular paa and thus lose the ability to scavenge free radicals leading to an aggravated accumulation of ros inside the cells ao et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 the high intracellular ros level may induce irreversible oxidative damage to cellular structure and biomolecules such as proteins lipids metabolic enzymes and nucleic acid moreno et al 2019 pals et al 2013 wu et al 2021 therefore results indicated that the paa uv paa could cause more severe oxidative damage in the uv paa stage compared to direct uv paa leading to more serious cellular dysfunction and death 3 4 3 generation of reactive species further investigations for identifying the specific reactive radicals generated in the uv paa and paa uv paa were conducted excess tert butyl alcohol tba 10 mm was spiked into the inactivation experiments to quench the oh k oh tba 6 0 108 m 1s 1 lin et al 2021 in the control experiments by adding 10 mm of tba alone fig s13 both a niger and a flavus had no appreciable inactivation indicating that quenching agent had no effect on the spores during the scavenging process as shown in fig 7 the addition of tba inhibited the inactivation efficiency of both uv paa and paa uv paa processes and there was a more obvious decline in paa uv paa in the presence of tba the k of a niger decreased by 33 0 and 53 3 under uv paa and paa uv paa and that of a flavus decreased by 18 5 and 39 6 respectively fig s14 results indicated the significant role of oh in the inactivation of fungal spores by uv paa and paa uv paa and compared with direct uv paa more oh was generated in paa uv paa epr experiment was also conducted to prove the presence of oh fig s15 in addition after the addition of tba there was still a certain inactivation effect for both uv paa and paa uv paa which was probably attributed to the effect of uv irradiation paa oxidation ro radicals and other synergism among all mechanisms to further assess the differences between uv paa and paa uv paa it was assumed that the inactivation effect of paa and uv was similar to that of paa alone and uv alone processes zhang et al 2020 as shown in table 1 the k uv paa tba was close to the sum of k uv and k paa for a niger and a flavus implying the negligible contribution of other ro radicals ch3c o oo ch3c o o and ch3c o in the fungi inactivation previous studies also reported that oh rather than ro was considered to be the dominant radical in the inactivation of bacteria and fungi by uv paa sun et al 2018 xu et al 2022b zhang et al 2020 meanwhile the k paa uv paa tba was slightly higher than k uv paa tba for example they were 0 70 min 1 in paa uv paa and 0 63 min 1 in uv paa for a niger and 1 02 min 1 and 0 97 min 1 for a flavus suggesting that the other synergism among all mechanisms in paa uv paa might be slightly stronger than uv paa overall the results confirmed that paa uv paa could generate more oh in uv paa stage compared to direct uv paa and the stronger radical production was the main reason for the enhanced inactivation 3 4 4 contribution of different mechanisms to overall inactivation multiple mechanisms were related in the uv paa based inactivation of fungi including 1 direct uv irradiation 2 direct oxidation of paa 3 indirect oxidation of reactive radical species produced in the photolysis such as oh ch3c o o ch3c o oo and ooch3 and 4 other synergistic effect among all mechanisms involved zhang et al 2020 the contributions of each part to the overall inactivation were further ascertained in this work the log inactivation under uv paa and paa uv paa could be composed of four parts and be expressed as eq 6 and the corresponding rate constants could be calculated by eq 7 zhang et al 2020 6 log n n 0 inactivation log n n 0 uv log n n 0 paa log n n 0 radicals log n n 0 other synergism 7 k inactivation k uv k paa k radicals k other synergism since tba mostly scavenged oh and the contribution of ro was inappreciable in the inactivation of fungi the contribution of reactive radicals mainly oh could be described as eq 8 8 log n n 0 radicals log n n 0 inactivation log n n 0 inactivation tba 9 k radicals k inactivation k inactivation tba then with k uv and k paa derived from kinetic model fitting k radicals was determined by eq 9 k other synergism could be obtained by eq 7 and the respective contribution of the individual mechanism was calculated as depicted in fig 8 during the uv paa inactivation process the contribution of the involved mechanism followed the order of uv radicals oh paa other synergism for both a niger and a flavus which was consistent with the previous finding xu et al 2022b however during the paa uv paa inactivation process the order changed in two aspects 1 the contributions of radicals oh and other synergism increased while those of uv irradiation and paa oxidation decreased 2 the radicals oh 53 even replaced uv 33 to be the dominant contributor for a niger but uv still contributed the most for a flavus these results further proved the advantage of paa uv paa strategy in improving the effect of radicals mainly oh and other synergism although the other synergism remained relatively minor 3 5 significance and implications overall the mechanism of enhanced inactivation of fungi by paa uv paa was depicted in fig 9 briefly the paa pre exposure created favorable conditions for the sufficient diffusion of paa into the whole cells and could significantly improve the subsequent uv paa for fungi inactivation the results suggested that the high efficiency of paa uv paa inactivation was mainly due to the increased oh generation and improved other synergism inside the cells in uv paa stage rather than the reaction of paa and cells in bulk solution in paa pre exposure stage the energy input of uv associated with electric cost may greatly limit the application of uv paa process in practical water treatment and the concomitant microbial regrowth of high paa dose is also an issue accordingly replacing high paa and uv dosages with longer paa exposure time appears to be an economical and meaningful approach for water treatment plants previous studies mostly focused on the addition of new substances or the combination of multiple activation methods to further enhance the inactivation efficiency of uv paa nevertheless the novel paa uv paa process achieves stronger inactivation efficacy of uv paa by simply extending the contact time of the paa itself therefore the diffusion property of paa provides a new perspective for the research of paa based disinfection it is recommended that this unique advantage be considered in future studies to explore effective methods for inactivating microorganisms additionally the difference between a niger and a flavus and the difference between bacteria and fungi also reflected the different enhancement of paa uv paa on various targets the optimal pre exposure time and paa concentration for different microorganisms and species should be considered to maximize the advantages of paa uv paa process this deserves a more comprehensive investigation in future studies 4 conclusions based on the results the following conclusions were drawn 1 under the same dosages of uv and paa the inactivation efficiency of fungal spores by four processes followed the order of paa uv paa uv paa uv paa paa uv paa also exhibited minimal regrowth potential after inactivation 2 with increasing paa pre exposure time the lag phase of fungi inactivation could be shortened and the inactivation of subsequent uv paa could be significantly enhanced leading to a better overall disinfection efficiency in paa uv paa 3 the inactivation of fungal spores by paa uv paa would be inhibited by increasing ph and ha concentration but a higher efficiency compared to uv paa could be achieved under the same conditions the difference in inactivation at ph 5 0 and 7 0 was more noticeable in paa uv paa than in direct uv paa 4 there were more severe membrane damage and a higher ros level increase in the inactivation by paa uv paa compared to direct uv paa which led to stronger oxidative stress and irreparable cellular dysfunction 5 the enhanced inactivation by paa uv paa was ascribed to the sufficient diffusion of paa which induced more oh production and higher other synergism in uv paa stage declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

15197,waterborne fungi pose a potential threat to water supply safety due to their high resistance to disinfectants peracetic acid as a promising alternative disinfectant to chlorine has attracted increasing attention in water treatment in this study the inactivation of two dominant fungal species aspergillus niger and aspergillus flavus by sequential application of peracetic acid and ultraviolet paa uv paa was reported for the first time results revealed that the pre exposure of paa could facilitate the subsequent process of uv paa combination and shorten the lag phase in fungi inactivation after 10 min of paa pre exposure paa uv paa achieved 3 03 and 2 40 log inactivation of aspergillus niger and aspergillus flavus which were 2 and 4 3 fold higher than that of direct uv paa under the same uv and paa doses paa uv paa disinfection also exhibited a stronger regrowth inhibition for incompletely inactivated fungal spores than direct uv paa the increase of ph 5 0 9 0 and humic acid concentration 1 0 5 0 mg l 1 showed an inhibitory effect on paa uv paa inactivation but paa uv paa was more adaptable in a wide ph range and the presence of humic acid compared to direct uv paa the more severe cell membrane damage and higher reactive oxygen species level in paa uv paa were evidenced for the first time by flow cytometry the increased hydroxyl radical generation and higher synergism were primarily responsible for inactivation improvement this study enhances the further understanding of the paa uv paa process and the findings are expected to promote the development of paa as a promising disinfectant for effective fungi control graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords peracetic acid ultraviolet fungal spores pre exposure sequential application data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the proliferation of waterborne fungi is an emerging concern to ecosystems and humans aspergillus species are ubiquitous filamentous fungi commonly found in various aquatic environments such as rivers reservoirs and distribution systems wen et al 2017a several species of aspergillus mainly aspergillus niger a niger aspergillus flavus a flavus and aspergillus fumigatus have been reported as potential pathogenic species pereira et al 2009 the presence of fungi can produce unpleasant smells tastes turbidity oliveira et al 2013 and release mycotoxins that may cause health problems such as hypersensitivity pneumonitis skin infection and sinusitis curtis et al 2004 hageskal et al 2009 wen et al 2017b traditional disinfectants including chlorine chloramine and ozone have been used for fungi inactivation in waterworks among which chlorine based disinfectants are most widely used due to their low cost ma and bibby 2017 wen et al 2020b however the formation of halogenated disinfection by products dbps like trihalomethanes thms and haloacetic acids haas by chlorine based disinfectants is unexpected uv technology has also been applied for the fungi control but studies showed that fungi exhibited resistance to uv irradiation due to the conidial protection mechanisms oliveira et al 2020 therefore the alternative disinfectants are urgently needed to address the fungi propagation in water sun et al 2018 peracetic acid paa ch3c o ooh a promising oxidant and disinfectant with high redox e0 paa 1 06 1 96 v and good biocidal effect has gained increasing attention in the municipal water and wastewater treatment cai et al 2017 lin et al 2021 wang et al 2020a compared with traditional chlorine based disinfection paa has less potential to form toxic dbps and is therefore considered a green alternative to chlorine chen et al 2019 wang et al 2020b to date an increasing number of studies on the degradation of micropollutants by paa based advanced oxidation processes have been reported but there are still few studies on the disinfection of pathogenic microorganisms ao et al 2021 among them uv paa is the most commonly used method to inactivate the pathogen efficiently under uv irradiation hydroxyl radical oh and organic radicals ro such as acetoxyl radical ch3co2 and acetylperoxy radical ch3co3 are generated through the cleavage of oo bond in paa molecular resulting in oxidative damage to the proteins lipids and nucleic acids of microorganisms cai et al 2017 chen et al 2019 owing to the larger and more complex cellular structures of eukaryotic fungi that differ from prokaryotic bacteria fungal spores are usually more challenging to be inactivated rangel et al 2018 xia et al 2022 the pigments in fungal cell walls may also play a protective role wen et al 2017b a niger and a flavus are two representative pathogenic fungi and have been reported to produce melanin to protect them against chlorine based disinfectants xu et al 2022a we have previously studied the inactivation of a niger and a flavus by paa alone and uv paa but results showed that the application of paa for inactivating fungi still had some limitations xu et al 2022b zuo et al 2022 paa alone treatment was less effective in inactivating fungi than chlorine it required a high dose of paa and showed a delay in inactivating a flavus zuo et al 2022 the uv paa process also required a high uv dose to inactivate fungal spores it took 7 min of uv irradiation to achieve 2 25 log inactivation of a niger when the paa dose was 7 mg l 1 and uv irradiance was 0 12 mw cm 2 xu et al 2022b the associated dosing expense and energy cost may limit the practical application of paa disinfectant for fungi control recently sun and zhang et al proposed an innovative disinfection strategy in which paa and uv were applied sequentially i e paa uv paa to enhance the inactivation of bacteria sun et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 specifically by pre exposing escherichia coli e coli to paa for 2 min and then applying uv for 1 min paa uv paa achieved an additional 4 7 5 4 log inactivation compared to direct uv paa under the same uv and paa doses zhang et al 2020 their studies provided us with new insights we were inspired to explore whether this shift from simultaneous combination uv paa to sequential combination paa uv paa can overcome the difficulties of inefficiencies and delay phenomenon encountered in our previous work on resistant fungi it is also meaningful and essential to examine the applicability of paa uv paa process in different microorganisms in addition there is much further work that can be done on this novel strategy firstly the residual acetic acid after paa disinfection may cause the pathogen regrowth zhang et al 2019 which would lead to the release of toxic metabolites that threaten the drinking water supplies zhang et al has reported that no appreciable regrowth of bacteria was observed within 24 h after complete inactivation close to or below the detection limit by paa uv paa zhang et al 2020 but for the more resistant fungi monitoring of the regrowth potential should be performed for a longer period of time the risk of regrowth of incompletely inactivated spores is also noteworthy meanwhile it is necessary to evaluate the effects of operating parameter and water matrices on paa uv paa inactivation the paa pre exposure time is crucial to the high inactivation efficiency of paa uv paa zhang et al 2020 solution ph is another critical factor in paa based processes because it affects the chemistry of radicals oxidants and target objects ao et al 2021 humic acid ha as a representative of natural organic matter nom may also affect the applicability of the process in natural water matrices chen et al 2019 these influencing factors are important to evaluate whether paa uv paa is a viable strategy for fungal control in real water treatment plants furthermore the mechanism of paa uv paa is worthy of further study the additional perspectives such as morphological and physiological changes in microorganisms the membrane integrity and intracellular reactive oxygen species ros level can also be used to elucidate the mechanism of the enhanced efficiency finally a more comprehensive comparison of paa uv paa and direct uv paa should be conducted for better understanding the effect of paa pre exposure on the subsequent uv paa process hence based on the discussion above this study aimed to 1 investigate the inactivation effect of paa uv paa on resistant fungi 2 monitor the long term regrowth potential of fungal spores after different degrees of paa uv paa inactivation 3 evaluate the influence of paa pre exposure time ph value and ha concentration on the inactivation 4 systematically elucidate the mechanisms of the enhanced inactivation of fungi by paa uv paa including the changes of membrane integrity intracellular ros level radical production and contribution of different mechanisms to the overall inactivation 5 provide a comprehensive comparison of paa uv paa and direct uv paa processes 2 materials and methods 2 1 fungal spores and reagents two representative fungal species a niger and a flavus were chosen in this study because they were the dominant pathogenic fungi isolated from groundwater source in northwest china and were reported to be highly resistant to disinfectants xu et al 2022a the detailed preparation method of spores stock solution was given in text s1 in the supplementary materials zuo et al 2022 peracetic acid around 17 6 paa 9 8 h2o2 by weight was obtained from sinopharm chemical reagent shanghai china the concentration of paa solution was measured using the n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd spectrophotometry method sun et al 2018 details of other chemical reagents were provided in text s2 2 2 experimental procedures 2 2 1 inactivation experiments the inactivation experiments were conducted in a collimated beam photoreactor as previously described wen et al 2017b the average uv254 fluence rate was determined to be 0 120 mw cm 2 by iodide iodate chemical actinometry rahn et al 2006 the uv lamp was warmed up for 30 min before experiments to guarantee the stability of photons output the paa uv paa inactivation experiments were conducted in the petri dishes which contained 100 ml phosphate buffer solution pbs 10 mm at ph 7 0 the fungal spore stock solution was diluted to achieve an initial concentration of 2 5 105 cfu ml 1 which was a concentration commonly used in the study of fungi disinfection al gabr et al 2013 xu et al 2022b firstly 7 mg l 1 of paa solution was added to the petri dish under dark condition to initiate the paa pre exposure reaction after the scheduled pre exposure intervals the uv irradiation was applied the solution was mixed with continuous magnetic stirring during the whole process the paa concentration was measured during the reaction fig s1 afterward aliquots 1 ml were sampled at selected uv irradiation timepoints and promptly spiked with excess sodium thiosulfate na2s2o3 paa 0 5 to quench the residual paa cai et al 2017 the concentration of fungal spores was measured by the heterotrophic plate count hpc method wen et al 2020b the samples were diluted and plated on dichloran rose bengal chloramphenicol drbc agar in triplicate and the plates were incubated in dark at 28 c for 2 3 days then the numbers of fungi colonies cfu ml 1 were counted the inactivation under uv paa and uv paa were performed separately for comparison with paa uv paa details were provided in text s3 the effect of pre exposure time 0 min 10 0 min initial ph 5 0 9 0 and ha concentration 0 5 0 mg l 1 were also investigated each experiment was repeated at least three times at 25 c and the results were reported as mean standard deviation of replicates 2 2 2 regrowth potential tests the regrowth experiments were performed after the different degrees of paa uv paa and uv paa inactivation different treatment times were applied for the fungal spores to achieve 1 log 2 log 3 log and complete inactivation below the detection limit 10 cfu ml 1 after treatment the residual paa was quenched by na2s2o3 after inactivation the regrowth potential was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 520 nm od520 every 4 h using a microplate reader varioskan flash thermo scientific usa luo et al 2021 50 μl of the inactivated spore suspension and 150 μl of r2a broth duan et al 2020 simões et al 2015 the compositions were displayed in table s1 were uniform mixed and added to the 96 well microplate as previously documented zuo et al 2022 then the mixture was cultured at suitable light and temperature parallel samples were performed in sextuplicate for the control experiments spores without inactivated in r2a medium spores without inactivated and completely inactivated in pbs were also conducted 2 3 mechanism analysis the cell membrane integrity was evaluated by flow cytometer fcm accuri c6 bd usa combined with sybr green і propidium iodide sg pi dye and intracellular reactive oxygen species ros was evaluated by fcm combined with dihydroethidium dhe dye as previously reported cao et al 2021 wen et al 2020a the spores after heating treatment 70 c for 15 min were used as positive controls to define the spores with damaged membrane and high ros level quenching experiments were conducted under the same procedures as the inactivation experiments but added excess 10 mm tert butyl alcohol tba at the beginning of the reactions kim et al 2019 li et al 2021 the 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo was used as a spin trapping agent for electron paramagnetic resonance epr measurement on an emxmicro 6 1 epr spectrometer bruker germany chen et al 2021 wan et al 2022 the contribution of multiple mechanisms involved were also analyzed referring to the previous study zhang et al 2020 details of fcm analysis and epr procedures were given in text s4 2 4 data analysis and kinetic modeling the log reduction of fungal spores after inactivation was described by eq 1 1 n log n n 0 where n represents the value of log inactivation n0 and n denote the viable fungal spores cfu ml 1 before and after inactivation in the inactivation curves of fungi the phenomenon of initial shoulder lag phases before the linear decay exists in some processes and species this may be related to the protection from the complex structure pigments in cell wall and outer surface aggregation of fungal spores berthelot et al 2020 bowman and free 2006 in order to modify the deviations of classic linear model geeraerd and van impe model fitting tool ginafit was utilized in this study to calculate the inactivation rate constants k berney et al 2006 geeraerd et al 2005 based on the shapes of inactivation curves the log linear regression model eq 2 and log linear regression plus shoulder model eq 3 were chosen to describe the inactivation 2 n n 0 e k max t 3 n n 0 e k max t e k max sl 1 e k max sl 1 e k max t where n0 and n are the number of colonies cfu ml 1 before and after inactivation k max is the maximum inactivation rate constant min 1 t is the reaction time min and sl is the shoulder length min the goodness of fit was evaluated using the correlation coefficient r2 3 results and discussion 3 1 inactivation of fungal spores by paa uv uv paa and paa uv paa paa uv and uv paa inactivation were conducted individually to compare with paa uv paa as depicted in fig 1 the ginafit tools was used to calculated the inactivation rate constants k of a niger and a flavus in different processes according to the shapes of inactivation curves and the maximum values of r2 the inactivation of a niger by uv uv paa and paa uv paa processes fitted well with the log linear regression plus shoulder model while the paa alone fitted well with the log linear regression model the inactivation of a flavus by four processes all fitted well with the log linear regression plus shoulder model the difference in model for paa alone inactivation was consistent with our previous study suggesting that a flavus was more resistant to paa disinfection than a niger zuo et al 2022 as shown in fig s2 the k values of the two fungal spores in the four processes followed the order of k paa uv paa k uv paa k uv k paa the results showed that paa uv paa exhibited the best inactivation performance compared to uv paa and uv paa besides as presented in fig 1 the paa uv paa and uv paa could be further compared in terms of reaction time after 10 min of paa pre exposure a niger was inactivated to 2 96 log after 5 5 min reaction by subsequent uv paa while the same log inactivation under direct uv paa required more than 8 3 min between 8 3 and 9 7 min although the total time of the same log inactivation under direct uv paa was shorter than paa uv paa 15 5 min the uv doses needed for paa uv paa 40 mj cm 2 was less than uv paa more than 60 mj cm 2 a similar phenomenon could also be seen in the inactivation of a flavus results showed that paa uv paa could reduce the uv input by nearly one third less than direct uv paa in addition according to the previous research the synergistic factor sf calculated by eqs 4 5 could also be used to compare the inactivation under paa uv paa and uv paa marjanovic et al 2018 4 s f uv paa k uv paa k uv k paa 5 s f paa uv paa k paa uv paa k uv k paa as shown in fig s3 the sf of uv paa and paa uv paa were 1 54 and 2 46 for a niger and were 1 28 and 1 82 for a flavus respectively the result further demonstrated the higher inactivation efficiency in paa uv paa than in direct uv paa the high inactivation efficiency of paa uv paa was attributed to the diffusion of paa in the study of zhang et al fluorescence microscopy method has directly evidenced the diffusion of paa into the e coli cells which allowed more uv activating paa to occur within the cells resulting in severe cells damages zhang et al 2020 a previous study showed that the inactivation of e coli by h2o2 uv h2o2 did not show an enhanced effect like paa uv paa implying that the diffusion property of paa was unique sun et al 2018 compared with direct uv paa paa uv paa further prolonged the time of paa diffusion which significantly improved the subsequent uv paa inactivation 3 2 regrowth potential of fungi after varying degrees of inactivation to evaluate the long term inactivation effect and safety of paa uv paa process the monitoring of regrowth potential was conducted for 120 h as illustrated in fig 2 the fungal spores after different degrees of inactivation by paa uv paa and uv paa were compared no appreciable regrowth of fungal spores was observed after 3 log and complete inactivation by both paa uv paa and uv paa this was consistent with the previous report showing no observed regrowth for bacteria within 24 h after complete inactivation by paa uv paa and uv paa zhang et al 2020 however after 1 log and 2 log inactivation the regrowth potential showed a difference the results indicated that paa uv paa exhibited better inhibition of regrowth of incompletely inactivated fungi than direct uv paa the possible reason for regrowth was that the acetic acid in paa solution could act as carbon source for microbial survival sun et al 2018 since fungi have been reported to be highly resistant to disinfectants xia et al 2022 there may be more risk of incomplete inactivation during the actual inactivation process the superiority of paa uv paa suggested that the pre exposure of paa seemed to be important for effective inhibition of regrowth of fungi the conclusion further proved that paa uv paa had good application prospects in the inactivation of recalcitrant fungal spores 3 3 effects of operating parameter and water matrices on inactivation 3 3 1 effect of paa pre exposure time to further disclose the influence of paa pre exposure time on the inactivation a niger and a flavus spores were pre exposed to paa for different times 0 5 0 and 10 0 min and then treated with combined uv irradiation as shown in fig 3 a and fig 3 b the lag phase during the uv paa stage was shortened with longer paa pre exposure times which was particularly significant for a flavus the k of the uv paa stage for a niger and a flavus increased from 0 96 to 1 49 min 1 and from 1 17 to 1 67 min 1 respectively fig s4 as shown in fig 3 c and fig 3 d the log inactivation by subsequent uv paa stage was increased with the prolongation of paa pre exposure time after 10 min of paa pre exposure the overall log inactivation of a niger nearly doubled from 1 50 log to 3 03 log and a flavus increased over 4 fold from 0 56 log to 2 40 log evidently the results suggested that the longer paa pre exposure time led to a better fungi inactivation during the subsequent uv paa shortened the lag phase and brought higher efficiency of the overall inactivation by paa uv paa this conclusion was in agreement with the results presented by zhang and cao et al for the inactivation of bacteria and algae by paa uv paa cao et al 2022 sun et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 different from chlorine based disinfectants which mainly destroy the outer cellular structures paa kills the microorganisms primarily by penetrating cells and producing reactive radical species inside the cells zhang et al 2019 in a study dealing with bacterial biofilms chlorine was more effective than paa within a short contact time 5 10 min but paa gradually performed better than chlorine after a longer contact time 50 min park et al 2012 cao et al also demonstrated that paa contact time rather than paa dose was more critical to uv paa inactivation through kinetic calculation cao et al 2022 accordingly the sufficient diffusion of paa was crucial in paa based disinfection 3 3 2 effect of initial ph to determine the influence of ph on paa uv paa process experiments at different ph values 5 0 7 0 and 9 0 were carried out fig s5 to fig s7 as shown in fig 4 the k of uv paa stage in paa uv paa process decreased as the ph increased from 5 0 to 9 0 the k values fell from 1 59 min 1 to 1 17 min 1 for a niger and from 1 77 min 1 to 1 04 min 1 for a flavus according to the previous studies several factors together resulted in the inhibition firstly the pka of paa is 8 2 owing to the oxidation capacity of deprotonated paa paa is weaker than that of neutral paa paa0 the inactivation efficiency is weakened with increasing ph wang et al 2020a wang et al 2020b meanwhile the molar absorption coefficient of paa is higher than paa0 thus the photolysis of paa is faster than paa0 in alkaline conditions ao et al 2021 furthermore increased ph can make the surface of fungal spores more negatively charged the stronger electrostatic repulsion between paa and cells further decreases the inactivation efficiency zuo et al 2022 compared to direct uv paa process the paa uv paa process could achieve higher inactivation efficiency under all three conditions and exhibit remarkable ph tolerant performance in addition it was surprisingly found that ph impacted the two processes in a sort of different way specifically for direct uv paa process the inactivation efficiency at ph 5 0 was relatively close to that at ph 7 0 while the apparent decrease appeared when ph increased to 9 0 fig s6 similar results were also found in the study of baldry et al which investigated the inactivation of bacteria with paa baldry et al 1991 however for paa uv paa process the inactivation efficiency gradually decreased with the increasing ph and the difference could be seen between ph 5 0 and 7 0 fig s5 the possible reason for this discrepancy was that in the uv paa process the protonation deprotonation of paa was a main factor affected by ph changes kim et al 2019 while in the paa uv paa process previous research reported that the solubility of cellular components such as protein might be influenced by the solution ph amiri et al 2010 the surface characteristic of microorganisms could also become an important ph related factors due to the influence on penetrating performance of paa therefore unlike with ph 8 2 as the threshold in uv paa process there was difference between acid and neutral condition in paa uv paa process 3 3 3 effect of ha concentration the effect of nom on the inactivation of fungi by paa uv paa was tested by adding different concentrations of ha and the results were compared with uv paa fig s8 to fig s10 as illustrated in fig 5 ha displayed a negative impact on fungi inactivation in paa uv paa similar observations were also reported in previous studies on inactivation of algae and fungi by uv paa process cao et al 2022 xu et al 2022b the k of a niger and a flavus in the uv paa stage of paa uv paa process decreased by 44 5 and 34 5 respectively previous studies reported that the inhibition effect of ha on uv paa based inactivation efficiency was mainly ascribed to the two following factors owing to the large absorbance of ha the competition of ha for uv photons may affect the paa photolysis chen et al 2019 besides ha has a high scavenging capacity for ro and oh reducing the concentration of radicals in the system cao et al 2022 the comparison between paa uv paa and uv paa showed that although both processes were gradually inhibited with the increasing ha concentration the paa uv paa exhibited better performance than direct uv paa under the same ha concentration the results implied that the pre exposure of paa could alleviate the inhibition effect of ha on fungi inactivation by uv paa a latest study by zhang et al also demonstrated that the inactivation of e coli by paa uv paa showed a stable performance in produce wash water with high organic content and the inactivation was negligibly affected by the uv light shielding zhang et al 2022 accordingly in waters containing a high concentration of nom paa pre exposure could be applied before the uv paa process to obtain better inactivation efficiency of fungi 3 4 inactivation mechanisms 3 4 1 membrane integrity the cell membrane integrity was evaluated by fcm combined sg pi dye according to our previous study wen et al 2020a with results shown in fig 6 and fig s11 the percentage of spores with intact membrane in uv paa and paa uv paa was comparable before the uv irradiation started 0 min in figures suggesting the limited impact of 10 min of 7 mg l 1 paa pre exposure on spore membrane zhang et al also demonstrated that 120 μm paa entered the e coli cells within 5 min by diffusion while maintaining the integrity of most of the membrane zhang et al 2020 after the combination of uv irradiation both uv paa and paa uv paa inactivation exhibited a negative effect on membrane integrity over time however paa uv paa caused more significant damage to the membrane during the subsequent uv paa stage compared to direct uv paa the percentage of a niger spores with intact membrane decreased by 21 5 and 45 1 after direct uv paa and paa uv paa after 5 5 min of uv irradiation and for a flavus spores it decreased by 14 3 and 35 respectively the aggravated membrane damage in the uv paa stage was probably due to the accumulation of oxidative stress inside the cells sun et al evaluated the location of oh production in paa uv paa process and found that paa diffusion allowed oh to be produced inside the cells therefore showed a strong disinfection power sun et al 2018 in general the results showed that paa uv paa performed more distinct damage to the cell membrane compared to direct uv paa and the membrane damage predominantly occurred in the uv paa stage rather than the paa pre exposure stage besides microorganisms after disinfection may undergo an intermediate state as viable but non culturable vbnc which is hardly detectable by hpc method but can be determined by fcm analysis kong et al 2015 phe et al 2005 hence the hpc method was also conducted to compare with fcm to evaluate the fungal spore viability as shown in fig 6 the higher percentage of viable cells was observed by fcm analysis the red lines than by hpc method the black lines indicating the presence of vbnc cells wen et al 2020b after the inactivation by paa uv paa and uv paa the percentage of vbnc cells was 35 2 and 58 0 for a niger and 47 5 and 52 3 for a flavus respectively the results showed that paa uv paa had less induction of the vbnc state than direct uv paa 3 4 2 intracellular ros level intracellular ros is formed during the cellular metabolic process and can serve as a critical indicator of oxidative stress gessler et al 2007 the changes in ros of the two fungal spores were measured by fcm combined dhe dye using the method previously described cao et al 2021 with results shown in fig 6 and fig s12 the difference between uv paa and paa uv paa was relatively inconspicuous before the uv irradiation started 0 min in figures the result was in agreement with our previous study the change of ros level of fungi was unapparent after paa alone zuo et al 2022 after the introduction of uv an increase in the proportion of spores with high ros level was observed in both uv paa and paa uv paa processes however a more significant rise of intracellular ros level was observed in paa uv paa compared to direct uv paa after uv paa and paa uv paa treatments the percentage of a niger with high ros level increased by 30 5 and 49 5 and that of a flavus increased by 19 6 and 86 9 respectively the remarkable ros increase of a flavus provided direct evidence to the result in section 3 3 1 that the inactivation of a flavus could be sharply improved after paa pre exposure the higher ros level in paa uv paa could be elucidated by the following aspects increasing intracellular paa and h2o2 made the direct oxidation and uv photolysis simultaneously occur inside the cells to exhibit more intense oxidative stress zhang et al 2020 the radicals chain reactions were accelerated to produce more radicals for indirect oxidation increasing the ros level cai et al 2017 cao et al 2022 the catalase enzyme might be inactivated by intracellular paa and thus lose the ability to scavenge free radicals leading to an aggravated accumulation of ros inside the cells ao et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 the high intracellular ros level may induce irreversible oxidative damage to cellular structure and biomolecules such as proteins lipids metabolic enzymes and nucleic acid moreno et al 2019 pals et al 2013 wu et al 2021 therefore results indicated that the paa uv paa could cause more severe oxidative damage in the uv paa stage compared to direct uv paa leading to more serious cellular dysfunction and death 3 4 3 generation of reactive species further investigations for identifying the specific reactive radicals generated in the uv paa and paa uv paa were conducted excess tert butyl alcohol tba 10 mm was spiked into the inactivation experiments to quench the oh k oh tba 6 0 108 m 1s 1 lin et al 2021 in the control experiments by adding 10 mm of tba alone fig s13 both a niger and a flavus had no appreciable inactivation indicating that quenching agent had no effect on the spores during the scavenging process as shown in fig 7 the addition of tba inhibited the inactivation efficiency of both uv paa and paa uv paa processes and there was a more obvious decline in paa uv paa in the presence of tba the k of a niger decreased by 33 0 and 53 3 under uv paa and paa uv paa and that of a flavus decreased by 18 5 and 39 6 respectively fig s14 results indicated the significant role of oh in the inactivation of fungal spores by uv paa and paa uv paa and compared with direct uv paa more oh was generated in paa uv paa epr experiment was also conducted to prove the presence of oh fig s15 in addition after the addition of tba there was still a certain inactivation effect for both uv paa and paa uv paa which was probably attributed to the effect of uv irradiation paa oxidation ro radicals and other synergism among all mechanisms to further assess the differences between uv paa and paa uv paa it was assumed that the inactivation effect of paa and uv was similar to that of paa alone and uv alone processes zhang et al 2020 as shown in table 1 the k uv paa tba was close to the sum of k uv and k paa for a niger and a flavus implying the negligible contribution of other ro radicals ch3c o oo ch3c o o and ch3c o in the fungi inactivation previous studies also reported that oh rather than ro was considered to be the dominant radical in the inactivation of bacteria and fungi by uv paa sun et al 2018 xu et al 2022b zhang et al 2020 meanwhile the k paa uv paa tba was slightly higher than k uv paa tba for example they were 0 70 min 1 in paa uv paa and 0 63 min 1 in uv paa for a niger and 1 02 min 1 and 0 97 min 1 for a flavus suggesting that the other synergism among all mechanisms in paa uv paa might be slightly stronger than uv paa overall the results confirmed that paa uv paa could generate more oh in uv paa stage compared to direct uv paa and the stronger radical production was the main reason for the enhanced inactivation 3 4 4 contribution of different mechanisms to overall inactivation multiple mechanisms were related in the uv paa based inactivation of fungi including 1 direct uv irradiation 2 direct oxidation of paa 3 indirect oxidation of reactive radical species produced in the photolysis such as oh ch3c o o ch3c o oo and ooch3 and 4 other synergistic effect among all mechanisms involved zhang et al 2020 the contributions of each part to the overall inactivation were further ascertained in this work the log inactivation under uv paa and paa uv paa could be composed of four parts and be expressed as eq 6 and the corresponding rate constants could be calculated by eq 7 zhang et al 2020 6 log n n 0 inactivation log n n 0 uv log n n 0 paa log n n 0 radicals log n n 0 other synergism 7 k inactivation k uv k paa k radicals k other synergism since tba mostly scavenged oh and the contribution of ro was inappreciable in the inactivation of fungi the contribution of reactive radicals mainly oh could be described as eq 8 8 log n n 0 radicals log n n 0 inactivation log n n 0 inactivation tba 9 k radicals k inactivation k inactivation tba then with k uv and k paa derived from kinetic model fitting k radicals was determined by eq 9 k other synergism could be obtained by eq 7 and the respective contribution of the individual mechanism was calculated as depicted in fig 8 during the uv paa inactivation process the contribution of the involved mechanism followed the order of uv radicals oh paa other synergism for both a niger and a flavus which was consistent with the previous finding xu et al 2022b however during the paa uv paa inactivation process the order changed in two aspects 1 the contributions of radicals oh and other synergism increased while those of uv irradiation and paa oxidation decreased 2 the radicals oh 53 even replaced uv 33 to be the dominant contributor for a niger but uv still contributed the most for a flavus these results further proved the advantage of paa uv paa strategy in improving the effect of radicals mainly oh and other synergism although the other synergism remained relatively minor 3 5 significance and implications overall the mechanism of enhanced inactivation of fungi by paa uv paa was depicted in fig 9 briefly the paa pre exposure created favorable conditions for the sufficient diffusion of paa into the whole cells and could significantly improve the subsequent uv paa for fungi inactivation the results suggested that the high efficiency of paa uv paa inactivation was mainly due to the increased oh generation and improved other synergism inside the cells in uv paa stage rather than the reaction of paa and cells in bulk solution in paa pre exposure stage the energy input of uv associated with electric cost may greatly limit the application of uv paa process in practical water treatment and the concomitant microbial regrowth of high paa dose is also an issue accordingly replacing high paa and uv dosages with longer paa exposure time appears to be an economical and meaningful approach for water treatment plants previous studies mostly focused on the addition of new substances or the combination of multiple activation methods to further enhance the inactivation efficiency of uv paa nevertheless the novel paa uv paa process achieves stronger inactivation efficacy of uv paa by simply extending the contact time of the paa itself therefore the diffusion property of paa provides a new perspective for the research of paa based disinfection it is recommended that this unique advantage be considered in future studies to explore effective methods for inactivating microorganisms additionally the difference between a niger and a flavus and the difference between bacteria and fungi also reflected the different enhancement of paa uv paa on various targets the optimal pre exposure time and paa concentration for different microorganisms and species should be considered to maximize the advantages of paa uv paa process this deserves a more comprehensive investigation in future studies 4 conclusions based on the results the following conclusions were drawn 1 under the same dosages of uv and paa the inactivation efficiency of fungal spores by four processes followed the order of paa uv paa uv paa uv paa paa uv paa also exhibited minimal regrowth potential after inactivation 2 with increasing paa pre exposure time the lag phase of fungi inactivation could be shortened and the inactivation of subsequent uv paa could be significantly enhanced leading to a better overall disinfection efficiency in paa uv paa 3 the inactivation of fungal spores by paa uv paa would be inhibited by increasing ph and ha concentration but a higher efficiency compared to uv paa could be achieved under the same conditions the difference in inactivation at ph 5 0 and 7 0 was more noticeable in paa uv paa than in direct uv paa 4 there were more severe membrane damage and a higher ros level increase in the inactivation by paa uv paa compared to direct uv paa which led to stronger oxidative stress and irreparable cellular dysfunction 5 the enhanced inactivation by paa uv paa was ascribed to the sufficient diffusion of paa which induced more oh production and higher other synergism in uv paa stage declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

15198,in recent decades many inland lakes have seen an increase in the prevalence of potentially harmful algae in many inland lakes the peak season for algae abundance summer and early fall in the northern hemisphere coincides with the peak season for recreational use currently little information regarding expected algae conditions is available prior to the peak season for productivity in inland lakes peak season algae conditions are influenced by an array of pre season spring and early summer local and global scale variables identifying these variables for forecast development may be useful in managing potential public health threats posed by harmful algae using the lagos ne dataset pre season local and global drivers of peak season algae metrics represented by chlorophyll a are identified for 178 lakes across the northeast and midwest u s from readily available gridded datasets forecasting models are built for each lake conditioned on relevant pre season predictors forecasts are assessed for the magnitude severity and duration of seasonal chlorophyll concentrations regions of pre season sea surface temperature and pre season chlorophyll a demonstrate the most predictive power for peak season algae metrics and resulting models show significant skill based on categorical forecast metrics more than 70 of magnitude models and 90 of duration models outperform climatology forecasts of high and severe algae magnitude perform best in large mesotrophic and oligotrophic lakes however high algae duration performance appears less dependent on lake characteristics the advance

many waterbodies hydroclimatic variability plays an important role in determining water quality on inter and intra annual timescales and may influence the suitability of conditions for algae growth león muñoz et al 2018 scordo et al 2022 nutrient runoff in particular is sensitive to variability in the hydrologic cycle which has been projected to intensify with climate change glavan et al 2015 me et al 2018 anthropogenic stressors favoring the dominance of harmful algae combined with notable variability in algae biomass presents a substantial challenge for water resource managers in the u s harmful algae in large waterbodies such as lake erie has received significant research and media attention reutter et al 2011 international joint commission 2014 wines 2014 patel and parshina kottas 2017 dalton 2021 however despite similar concerns strategies for managing harmful algae in small inland waterbodies across the u s have received less attention brooks et al 2016 in the northern hemisphere algae biomass tends to peak in the late summer and early fall july october as a result of a complex array of pre season and within season physical chemical and biological processes in the midwest and northeast u s this season is characterized by warm temperatures and increased sunlight allowing for increased photosynthesis and algae productivity singh and singh 2015 in many instances significant intra and inter annual variability in peak season algae biomass is evident driven partially by local hydrology and temperature that are in turn modulated by large scale climate phenomena through atmospheric teleconnections beal et al 2021 predictions of how these algae conditions vary may benefit lake managers by allowing them to take early actions to reduce or mitigate harm caused by intense algae growth short term days to weeks predictions of chlorophyll a a proxy for algal biomass are typically issued within season and focus on expected bloom formation or toxin production allowing managers to take rapid actions to address odor and taste issues transition to alternative water sources post warning signs at beaches etc zhang et al 2013 chen et al 2015 qian et al 2021 wynne et al 2013 in contrast longer lead months pre season predictions of expected algae conditions may allow lake managers to address a different set of actions e g life guard training public awareness etc and decisions e g testing and monitoring budgets and plans together these predictions can provide decision makers with multi scale information to inform appropriate actions at various lead times however season ahead predictions for water quality have received relatively little attention longer lead predictions of oceanic chlorophyll a and inland nutrient loading have been developed with some success e g cho et al 2016 park et al 2019 rousseaux et al 2021 but little attention has been devoted to inland lakes long lead predictions of algae that do exist typically focus on singular metrics often mean biomass to characterize the potential loss of ecosystem services due to algae accumulation however further characterization may be warranted for example wilkinson et al 2021 define three metrics to characterize algae conditions including magnitude mean seasonal chlorophyll severity peak seasonal chlorophyll and duration length of time chlorophyll is above a threshold concentration in addition to information provided by mean biomass this approach provides lake managers with information that specifically addresses two key management concerns related to algae the potential for severe consequences of algae blooms such as fish kills and toxin production and length of time a lake may be unfit for recreation long lead predictions also often rely predominantly on nutrient loads as predictors stow et al 1997 lathrop et al 1998 stumpf et al 2016 however consideration of relevant hydroclimatic predictors has the potential to enhance prediction performance and expand the availability of water quality predictions to many small inland lakes beal et al 2021 there is a large and long body of evidence illustrating the impacts of external nutrient loading on phytoplankton growth in lakes vollenweider 1971 schindler 1978 reynolds 1984 elliott et al 2006 kane et al 2014 phosphorus and nitrogen are widely considered the most important nutrients for phytoplankton growth in freshwater schindler 1971 1977 transportation of phosphorus and nitrogen into a lake from the surrounding watershed is an important driver of algae abundance in many systems nutrient transport is influenced by global and local hydroclimatic variables and thus also represent important processes in determining algae abundance increased precipitation has been linked to increased fluxes of nitrogen and phosphorus sinha et al 2017 particularly in extreme precipitation events haygarth and jarvis 1997 royer et al 2006 carpenter et al 2015 2018 soil moisture conditions may also influence nutrient loading by regulating runoff potential kleinman et al 2006 liu et al 2014 finally water temperature has also been shown to control phytoplankton biomass and growth rate eppley 1972 konopka and brock 1978 robarts and zohary 1987 elliott et al 2006 liu et al 2019 trombetta et al 2021 and is closely linked to local air temperature shuter et al 1983 woolway et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 march june water temperature data are not readily available for all study lakes and are therefore not included in the final set of potential predictors in addition to management applications season ahead forecasts at scale provide a unique opportunity to understand ecological relationships between hydroclimatic variables and water quality houlahan et al 2017 in particular the relevance of global scale processes in determining algae biomass in inland lakes is not well studied several studies have identified teleconnections between large scale climate phenomena and phytoplankton dynamics in inland lakes arhonditsis et al 2004 xiao et al 2019 da rosa wieliczko et al 2021 however few studies exist that investigate the application of global climate patterns to chlorophyll a prediction in inland lakes beal et al 2021 developed a sub seasonal 2 month lead forecast of cyanobacteria biomass in lake mendota wisconsin wi conditioned on local hydroclimatic variables and teleconnections with global climate patterns a large scale analysis of season ahead predictors of algae biomass is well suited to improve the understanding of dominant climate signals related to chlorophyll a using chlorophyll a time series from 178 lakes in the northeast and midwest u s we evaluated if global and local hydroclimatic processes can be used to predict algal magnitude severity and duration in each lake using a statistical modeling and forecast validation hindcast approach specifically we address the following questions 1 do local and global sea surface temperature sst hydroclimatic variables correlate with chlorophyll metrics in a given lake 2 are skillful predictions based on these variables possible for algal magnitude duration and severity 3 can variability in forecast model performance be explained by static lake specific characteristics this modeling approach may provide insight into the role of local and global hydroclimatic variability in the development of peak season algal biomass evaluate the ability of hydroclimatic variables to provide actionable information to lake managers at a seasonal timescale and indicate which characteristics of small inland lakes make them ideal candidates for seasonal forecast development 2 materials and methods 2 1 lake characterization and selection chlorophyll a measurements sampled at the surface of the lake and analyzed following project specific protocols for each lake were obtained from lagos ne soranno et al 2017 the measurements range from 1982 to 2013 in the database but several chlorophyll timeseries were extended through 2020 by collating additional measurements from the reporting agency or program referenced in lagos ne for each lake lagos ne aggregates data from lakes located throughout the midwest and northeast u s in this region chlorophyll a tends to reach peak concentrations between july and october jaso fig 1 the data from this period were used to calculate three chlorophyll metrics magnitude severity and duration see explanation below for each lake year to adequately characterize july october chlorophyll a metrics sufficiently long observational records and frequent within season sampling are needed therefore lakes for this analysis needed at least 15 years of july october chlorophyll a measurements and a minimum sampling frequency of once every 14 days following the selection methods of wilkinson et al 2021 based on these requirements 178 lakes were identified from 10 states in the midwest michigan wisconsin minnesota ohio and missouri 64 lakes and northeast new york vermont rhode island pennsylvania and maine 114 lakes u s the chlorophyll data were log transformed for analysis to create a gaussian like distribution selected lakes had an average depth of 15 8 m min 1 2 m max 198 4 m and an average area of 1297 9 hectares min 1 4 ha max 113 496 5 ha 2 2 chlorophyll metrics to characterize and eventually predict algal conditions in each lake year during the july october season three metrics were used magnitude severity and duration of chlorophyll a as defined by wilkinson et al 2021 magnitude is the mean chlorophyll a concentration in each lake year and duration is the portion of the season during which chlorophyll a concentrations exceed a threshold concentration for recreational value based on angradi et al 2018 here the severity metric has been altered from wilkinson et al 2021 and is defined as a function of magnitude seasons in which magnitude exceeds the 95th percentile of all historical chlorophyll concentrations rather than year specific concentrations are categorized as severe on an inter annual timescale magnitude characterizes the average conditions during the peak season and the corresponding impacts on ecosystem services severity reflects the probability of extreme algae biomass magnitude that is most likely to result in severe consequences like toxin production and fish kills finally duration is the persistence of high algal biomass associated with a loss of recreational value during the summer peak season the threshold concentrations used here are developed for two ecoregions mountains and plains and vary in each region based on recreational user s expectations for water quality because these are large regions lakes that fall below or above the chlorophyll a threshold in nearly all sampling events are removed from analysis to avoid artificially inflating overall forecast skill together these metrics may provide an enhanced understanding of algae conditions during the peak season of algal production with prospects for more refined actionable information compared to a singular forecast of mean chlorophyll magnitude a forecast that additionally provides advanced warning of protracted water quality impairment duration and the potential for severe consequences of algae growth severity allows for more nuanced decision making around budgeting testing and communicating water quality expectations with the public the extent to which these three metrics are correlated with local and global climate variables and predictable across a diverse set of lakes is the focus of this work 2 3 predictor variable selection to address whether local and global hydroclimatic variables are correlated with chlorophyll metrics in a given lake we evaluate to what extent pre season march through june observations of local and global hydroclimate variables are correlated with magnitude and duration for each lake correlations for severity were not evaluated independently in this analysis as the severity metric is a function of magnitude in addition to identifying common local and global hydroclimatic variables correlated with chlorophyll metrics this analysis was used to identify variables that would be used in the development of each lake specific forecasting model and the validation of each model in a hindcasting analysis the hindcasting analysis uses the lake specific forecasting model to predict each year in the chlorophyll metric timeseries without predictor information from the year of interest simulating a forecast for model validation specifically we included march june variables from readily available gridded datasets that were connected to physical processes that may affect magnitude and duration including table 1 total precipitation mm mean air temperature c mean volumetric soil moisture m 3 m 3 the sum of daily precipitation events exceeding 20 40 mm for midwest northeast watersheds and global sea surface temperature sst anomalies c methods for evaluating sst anomalies as predictors are described below additionally we evaluated if pre season chlorophyll a which reflects in situ processes and the nutrient availability at the start of the season is correlated with peak season chlorophyll metrics excluding extreme events all metrics were averaged over the march june season as discussed previously local hydrology regulates nutrient transport into lakes from the surrounding watershed which may ultimately influence algae abundance the influence of local hydrology based candidate predictors precipitation extreme events and soil moisture may vary based on land use and topography within a lake s watershed therefore local hydrology predictors were evaluated using a correlation analysis at each grid within each lake s huc12 watershed huc12 watershed polygons watershed boundary dataset 2021 were subset to only include areas higher in elevation than the corresponding lake fig a 1 using gridded elevation data for each watershed from the elevatr package for the r statistical programming language hollister et al 2021 the timeseries of candidate predictor variables from each grid intersecting the watershed polygon was used in the correlation analysis as was an average of all intersecting grids the grid with the strongest statistically significant correlation was retained for the subsequent hindcasting analysis high precipitation events may have a more significant influence on overall nutrient loading than total precipitation carpenter et al 2015 however precipitation events that lead to large loading events may vary by region due to land use topography and nutrient availability therefore separate thresholds were chosen for extreme precipitation events in midwest 20 mm and northeast 40 mm watersheds based on a sensitivity analysis of significant correlations between high precipitation events and peak season chlorophyll a magnitude conducted for each region on a global scale pre season sea surface temperatures can influence in season precipitation and temperature over the u s through modulation of atmospheric flow and thus indirectly influence peak season chlorophyll metrics barnston 1994 giannini et al 2000 markowski and north 2003 ssts evolve slowly with persistent months to years anomalies and thus can serve well as predictors at seasonal timescales barnett 1981 to identify oceanic regions with strong teleconnections to the northeast and midwest u s global pre season sea surface temperature sst anomaly grids were correlated with each lake s magnitude timeseries fig a 2 not surprisingly correlation patterns and thus oceanic regions of influence vary between the midwest and northeast u s ropelewski and halpert 1987 cpc 1997 enfield et al 2001 tootle et al 2005 therefore identification of teleconnections is performed separately for the midwest and northeast the number of significant correlations with chlorophyll a timeseries were tallied for each sst grid and mapped to identify oceanic regions in which sst grids were associated with algae abundance in the northeast and midwest sst grids that were significantly correlated with a large fraction of lakes 10 for midwest 20 for northeast were applied to a principal component analysis pca to extract the dominant modes of variability in sst data and reduce the dimensionality of candidate sst predictors given the large number of sst grids there is a high likelihood of generating spurious correlations performing pca extracts the dominant climate signals and minimizes the effect of spuriously correlated grids principal components pcs that explained more than 5 of the variance in sst anomaly data were retained as candidate predictors the time series of variables in table 1 were used in a correlation analysis with chlorophyll magnitude and duration for each lake to identify predictor variables for forecast model development and the subsequent hindcasting analysis fig 2 for each lake all variables that were significantly correlated with the chlorophyll metric p 0 05 were retained for the forecasting model out of the 178 lakes evaluated 135 lakes 50 midwest 85 northeast had at least one significant predictor variable for magnitude and 82 lakes 30 midwest 52 northeast for duration severity is a function of magnitude and therefore retained the same set of predictors 2 4 forecast model development two forecasting models were developed for each lake one focused on magnitude including severity and a separate model for duration proportion of sampling events above the impairment threshold the array of processes and feedbacks influencing algae growth and abundance are notoriously complex roelke and buyukates 2001 glibert and burkholder 2006 ho et al 2019 motivating a statistical modeling approach over a process based physical model approach for lakes with only one significant predictor from the correlation analysis a simple linear regression between that variable and the chlorophyll metric was constructed for the model to be used in the hindcast analysis for lakes with multiple significant predictors a principal component analysis and regression approach was used to build the forecasting model pca effectively deals with any multi collinearity present between predictors and therefore does not artificially inflate predictive skill here principal components were retained for the forecast model if they explained more than 10 of the variance this modeling approach assumes relationships between candidate predictors and peak season algae metrics on a seasonal timescale to be linear however given that many drivers of algae growth on short timescales days to weeks are considered nonlinear processes model residuals were evaluated for evidence of nonlinear relationships autocorrelation was also investigated in each of the candidate predictors and algae metrics except for sst pc1 which likely captures baseline increases in the temperature of the pacific ocean less than 10 of timeseries for each variable had more than two statistically significant autocorrelations lag 1 10 additionally random forest regression a nonlinear nonparametric modeling approach was tested to determine if there were notable changes in model skill due to potential nonlinearities or autocorrelation statistical models were developed using r version 4 2 1 a leave one out cross validation approach was used to evaluate model performance for each lake and chlorophyll metric hindcasting in short for each lake the observed value from one year of the chlorophyll metrics was removed from the timeseries and the forecasting models above were used to predict the missing value this process was done iteratively for all years in the timeseries for all lakes individually and both magnitude including severity and duration a prediction ensemble was created for each peak season chlorophyll metric in a lake year based on model errors difference between observed and predicted chlorophyll metric across the hindcast at that lake ensemble members are generated from a normal distribution of errors with mean zero based on maximum likelihood estimation for each time step 100 random draws from the distribution are added to the magnitude and duration predictions to form the ensemble prediction helsel and hirsch 1992 alexander et al 2019 2 5 performance measures to assess model performance four measures were adopted correlation coefficient r2 root mean square error rmse ranked probability skill score rpss and heidke skill score hss heidke 1926 epstein 1969 hss and rpss are measures of categorical skill interpreted as a percent improvement over a reference forecast a standard forecast for hydro climate prediction is an equal odds climatological distribution of historical observations here the distribution of historical observations of chlorophyll magnitude for each lake are split into four categories representing below normal near normal above normal and severe algae conditions if no predictive information is present a probabilistic prediction of jaso magnitude would default to climatology 33 chance of below normal 33 chance of near normal conditions 28 chance of above normal and 5 chance of severe conditions similarly observations of duration are split into two categories based on mean duration to represent expected below and above normal conditions forecast models developed for magnitude and duration generate probabilistic predictions of each category that are compared against climatology equal odds this allows for a direct comparison between the forecast models developed here and a benchmark climatology model to understand the prospects for enhanced predictive skill in general prediction models outperform climatology when the predicted probability of the observed category is greater than the climatological probability e g 50 for two categories 33 for three categories hss is defined as 1 h s s h e n e where h is the number of categorically correct forecasts n is the total number of predictions issued and e is the number of categorically correct predictions expected from the reference forecast hss values range from to 1 where negative values represent a forecast that performs worse than climatology 0 represents no skill and 1 represents a perfect prediction model the rpss is a categorical skill score that increasingly penalizes an ensemble forecast for assigning greater probability to categories farther from the observed category the rpss uses the ranked probability score

where rpsforecast and rpsclimatology are the rps values calculated using the forecast model and the reference forecast rpss values range from to 1 where 0 represents no skill and 1 represents a perfect forecast rpss values are calculated for each year and the median value is reported finally we evaluated if variability in hindcast model performance forecasting skill among lakes was related to static characteristics of the ecosystems we compared forecasting skill among categories of trophic state lake area land cover and geographic region among lakes the trophic state index tsi is calculated based on chlorophyll a and is categorized as oligotrophic tsi 40 mesotrophic 40 tsi 50 eutrophic 50 tsi 70 and hypereutrophic tsi 70 eq 4 carlson 1977 4 tsi chl 9 81 ln chl 30 6 3 results 3 1 leading algae characteristic predictors the three most frequently retained predictors include pre season chlorophyll a pc1 from ssts and extreme events for magnitude models the most frequently retained predictors for duration models include pre season chlorophyll a and pc1 and pc2 based on ssts pcs derived from ssts typically represent dominant large scale climate signals potential physical processes are explored further in the discussion magnitude and duration metrics are uncorrelated in most lakes only 11are significantly correlated at the 95 confidence level suggesting unique seasonal drivers for each metric in most lakes compared to magnitude models duration models have a more even distribution of retained predictors fig 3 in magnitude models pre season chlorophyll a meets the selection criteria in 63 of models sst pc1 in 42 of models and extreme events in 16 in duration models sst pc2 is selected in 38 of models sst pc1 in 33 and pre season chlorophyll a in 20 in both magnitude and duration models all three predictors are unlikely to appear in the same model suggesting variable influence of these processes by lake in magnitude models all three of the most frequently retained predictors are included in 7 of lakes in contrast one of the three predictors in included in 87 of magnitude models in duration models all three of the most frequently retained predictors are included for only two lakes 2 5 while one of the three predictors is included in 71 of duration models preseason sst grids that are statistically significantly correlated with chlorophyll a timeseries from at least 20 10 lakes are retained for the northeast midwest region fig 4 sst regions retained for both midwest and northeast lakes indicate teleconnection signals from the northern atlantic and the equatorial pacific for midwestern lakes more grids are retained in the mid and northern atlantic compared to the pacific comparatively the strongest signals for northeastern lakes are split more evenly between the upper atlantic and the equatorial pacific while local hydroclimatic predictors are present in a significant proportion of magnitude and duration models in most instances they are retained with ssts or pre season chlorophyll a particularly in magnitude models some combination of local hydroclimatic predictors precipitation extreme events soil moisture and air temperature are retained in 27 of magnitude prediction models while just 9 of magnitude models utilize only local hydroclimatic predictors i e without sst pcs or preseason chlorophyll a compared to magnitude models a larger proportion of duration models are built solely with local hydroclimatic variables hydroclimatic predictors are retained in 38 duration models and 22 of models are built exclusively with hydroclimatic predictors fig a 3 finally 86 of lakes have 1 or 2 significant predictors while the maximum number of predictors retained for a lake is 5 fig a 4 3 2 model performance for magnitude prediction models simple linear regression single predictor is applied to 53 of lakes whereas principal component regression pcr principal component analysis with multiple linear repression is applied to 47 of lakes a cross validated hindcast assessment for all lakes results in a mean r2 value of 0 28 0 0 85 and a mean rmse of 0 47 0 29 1 21 for categorical performance the mean hss and rpss values are 0 17 and 0 10 respectively additionally 87 70 of lake models have hss rpss values greater than zero indicating an improvement of prediction skill over climatology for most lakes further these models predict above normal and below normal algae abundance moderately well fig 5 with rpss values of 0 39 and 0 30 respectively severe events prove difficult to predict approximately 51 of magnitude models accurately predict an above normal or severe year when an elevated algae event is observed i e not below or near normal for more than half of observed elevated algae events fig 6 for duration prediction models simple linear regression is applied to 78 of lakes and pcr to 22 of lakes mean r2 and rmse are 0 23 0 0 65 and 0 34 0 16 0 42 respectively mean hss and rpss scores are 0 39 and 0 42 respectively and 96 94 of models improve over climatology based on hss rpss in a hindcast assessment durations of above normal are correctly predicted for more than half the available timeseries in 87 of lakes fig 6 additionally considering all models 67 of above normal durations are accurately predicted fig 5 a stark improvement over climatology for most lakes average model skill is similar between regions is similar however northeast lake forecast models outperform midwest lake models where differences in average skill scores occur fig 7 this may be expected given that the primary difference in predictor selection between models in the northeast and midwest is selection of relevant sst grids relevant northeast sst regions are more coherent than regions for the midwest which may represent a stronger influence on lake processes the minimal differences may also point to consistency in the predictive power of local and within lake variables between the northeast and midwest to evaluate the presence of nonlinear relationships residuals between predicted and observed chlorophyll metrics were investigated for each lake residuals generally appeared random suggesting that the relationships between the pre season drivers and peak season chlorophyll metrics investigated for this analysis can be approximated as linear hindcasts were also generated using random forest regression to test for an increase in predictive skill which may indicate the presence of nonlinear relationships random forests models were created with the same predictors selected for pcr each with 500 trees cross validated hindcast results are similar or slightly worse than pcr for both magnitude mean r2 0 25 rmse 0 48 hss 0 12 rpss 0 04 and duration mean r2 0 23 rmse 0 34 hss 0 34 rpss 0 39 suggesting that pcr is a suitable approach 4 discussion 4 1 regional characteristics predictions of peak season algae growth at scale provide insights into relevant global and local scale processes setting the conditions for peak season algae biomass pre season ssts and chlorophyll a observations provide the most predictive power for both magnitude and duration metrics reflecting the importance of these scales however while ssts and chlorophyll a are selected most frequently as predictors for both magnitude and duration the importance of each predictor is mixed by region fig 8 given that sst atmosphere teleconnections typically have regional influence spatial variability in performance of sst predictors may be the result of localized pre season processes superseding the influence of large scale climatic processes in peak season algae biomass for example food web dynamics are well established as having significant influence on aquatic primary productivity lampert et al 1986 carpenter et al 1987 vanni and temte 1990 in this study however the representation of food web dynamics is limited to pre season algae abundance while this variable is shown to be a powerful predictor of peak season productivity in many lakes the effect of pre season predatory control on algae communities is unrepresented this may limit the skill of prediction models for lakes in which zooplankton grazing plays a significant role in determining algae populations in the summer and early fall this limitation may be responsible for differences in average model performance for example magnitude and duration models in which pre season chlorophyll a is an important predictor and ssts are not perform worse on average than the inverse table 2 lakes retaining only pre season chlorophyll a may be more dependent on within lake processes many of which are not represented in these models this may explain the less robust predictive signal from pre season chlorophyll a in these lakes compared to lakes more heavily influenced by sst atmosphere teleconnections as discussed previously relevant sst anomaly grids are identified for the northeast and midwest separately the pcs of selected sst anomaly grids represent the dominant climate signals affecting the selected lakes across the northeast and midwest u s and may therefore be associated with large scale climate phenomena that have well established teleconnections with climate conditions across north america two dominant climate phenomena with variable impacts on local hydroclimatic conditions across the northeast and midwest include the north atlantic oscillation nao and the el niño southern oscillation enso ropelewski and halpert 1987 visbeck et al 2001 in the northeast two of the three sst pcs used as potential predictors are significantly correlated with both the nao index and multivariate enso index mei in the midwest two pcs are significantly correlated with the mei and all three are significantly correlated with the nao index this suggests that interannual variability in local climate and in lakes across the northeast and midwest is associated with both enso and nao like climate signals fig a 5 compared to pre season chlorophyll and ssts other variables considered here provide only modest skill in predicting algae characteristics for most lakes despite the perceived importance of local land and hydrologic variables modulating inflow and lake processes few were retained as predictors however land use and other watershed characteristics may be important in determining the relevance of these predictors local hydrology might be expected to play a larger role in promoting algae growth in agricultural watersheds given the effect of runoff on nutrient loading castillo et al 2000 mander et al 2000 this is reflected in predictor selection for model construction for example magnitude models in watersheds with greater than 25 agricultural land are nearly twice as likely to retain a local hydrologic predictor compared to models in watersheds with less agricultural land 18 4 vs 36 march june air temperatures are also retained in relatively few forecasting models overall but are notably included in more duration models than any of the local hydrologic predictors as discussed previously the importance of temperature in determining algae growth is well established however the air temperature predictor included here may be too simplistic to capture the relationship across all lakes significant variability in prediction skill exists among lakes with little evidence of spatial patterns on average skill scores are higher in the northeast compared to the midwest however variability within both regions is significant the frequency of predictor retention and the average magnitude of significant correlations between predictor variables and algae magnitude are similar by region particularly for the most frequently selected predictors including ssts pre season chlorophyll a and extreme events within 0 05 sst pc1 and extreme events in the northeast have slightly higher correlations with algae magnitude than in the midwest which may help explain slightly higher model skill scores in the northeast the magnitude of correlation between predictor variables and algae duration is also similar however sst pc2 is retained much more often in northeast models compared to midwest models 25 of lakes vs 5 of lakes given that sst pc2 is correlated with the nao this might indicate a greater influence of the nao on duration in the northeast and help explain the slightly higher skill scores of duration models in the northeast similarly distributions of skill scores across trophic state and lake area are variable fig 9 on average magnitude models appear to accurately predict increased algae abundances more frequently in larger lakes and in mesotrophic and oligotrophic lakes duration models have approximately equal distributions of skill across lake area and trophic state while the differences in magnitude model skill based on lake area and tsi category are notable they were found to be statistically insignificant in an analysis of variance anova lake area p 0 24 tsi p 0 36 therefore it may be difficult to draw definitive conclusions from these results there are a few potential explanations for the variability in magnitude model performance in an analysis of lake size and primary productivity in the canadian shield lakes fee et al 1994 found that larger lakes more efficiently convert external nutrient loads into phytoplankton biomass due to more frequent resuspension of sediments and receive a higher proportion of nutrient loads from runoff rather than direct precipitation the focus in this analysis on hydroclimatic predictors of nutrient runoff is therefore consistent with increased predictive skill in larger lakes notably air temperature did not stand out as an important predictor of algae abundance at a season ahead lead time as discussed previously temperature is well established as an important variable in algae growth in some cases warm temperatures have been shown to hold greater influence over phytoplankton growth salmaso et al 2012 and cyanobacteria growth in eutrophic lakes rigosi et al 2014 the air temperature predictor used here may be too simplistic to capture peak season water temperatures which may disproportionately contribute to lower model performance in eutrophic lakes rusak et al 2018 found a positive relationship between variability of chlorophyll a and trophic status in 18 globally distributed lakes which may also reduce predictability cottingham et al 2000 this may explain the moderate reduction in average skill in magnitude models for eutrophic lakes compared to lakes of a lower trophic status variability in prediction skill can also exist between similar or proximal lakes mariaville lake and duansespurg reservoir are two eutrophic waterbodies located in eastern new york approximately five miles apart mariaville lake has one of the best performing magnitude prediction models among the lakes considered and accurately predicts above normal and severe chlorophyll a conditions for each of the five years in which they are observed comparatively duansespurg reservoir only correctly predicts two out of six observed events fig 10 in 1999 for example the mariaville lake model accurately predicts a large probability of above normal conditions observed state and is even able to differentiate between above normal and severe comparatively for the same year the duansepurg model only predicts a 1 chance of below normal conditions observed state and both models predict an approximately 80 chance of above normal or severe conditions in 1999 77 mariaville 85 duanespurg the mariaville lake model includes ssts pc1 and pre season chlorophyll a as predictors whereas the duansespurg model includes only ssts pc2 the performance of the duanespurg model compared to the mariaville model again suggests that while global processes are important in setting conditions for peak season algae biomass and both explain significant variability in the magnitude timeseries of both lakes within lake processes that may determine interannual variability of peak season algae abundance are not entirely captured by the hydroclimatic predictors investigated here or by pre season algae abundance the variability in forecast skill and predictive power of hydroclimatic variables among study lakes highlights the importance of catchment and lake specific processes and characteristics in determining the effects of external climate forcing on peak season algae abundance catchment soil types land use and location as well as lake area depth and management may all influence the susceptibility of lake systems to climate variables moss 2012 and may alter predictive skill while forecasting models developed on the selected pre season predictors cannot entirely capture the nuances of peak season algae biomass it is notable that relatively simplistic statistical models based on global sea surface temperatures and pre season chlorophyll a show significant skill in many of the selected lakes for these lakes season ahead prediction of algae metrics may provide actionable information to lake managers and public health officials based on easily accessible gridded datasets and basic water quality monitoring 5 conclusions in this paper season ahead predictions for july october algae magnitude and duration are developed for 135 lakes identified across the northeast and midwest u s to inform lake management decisions prior to peak algae biomass prediction models are conditioned on local and global scale pre season march june readily available gridded hydroclimatic variables and pre season chlorophyll a global sst and pre season chlorophyll a are the most common sources of predictive power across lake models sst grids selected for prediction model development are concentrated in the northern atlantic and equatorial pacific with characteristics of both enso and nao forecasting models outperform climatology in 87 70 of magnitude models and in 96 94 of duration models based on hss rpss additionally skillful prediction of elevated algae metrics based on magnitude and duration is evident in more than half of the included lakes

15198,in recent decades many inland lakes have seen an increase in the prevalence of potentially harmful algae in many inland lakes the peak season for algae abundance summer and early fall in the northern hemisphere coincides with the peak season for recreational use currently little information regarding expected algae conditions is available prior to the peak season for productivity in inland lakes peak season algae conditions are influenced by an array of pre season spring and early summer local and global scale variables identifying these variables for forecast development may be useful in managing potential public health threats posed by harmful algae using the lagos ne dataset pre season local and global drivers of peak season algae metrics represented by chlorophyll a are identified for 178 lakes across the northeast and midwest u s from readily available gridded datasets forecasting models are built for each lake conditioned on relevant pre season predictors forecasts are assessed for the magnitude severity and duration of seasonal chlorophyll concentrations regions of pre season sea surface temperature and pre season chlorophyll a demonstrate the most predictive power for peak season algae metrics and resulting models show significant skill based on categorical forecast metrics more than 70 of magnitude models and 90 of duration models outperform climatology forecasts of high and severe algae magnitude perform best in large mesotrophic and oligotrophic lakes however high algae duration performance appears less dependent on lake characteristics the advance

et al 2018 anthropogenic stressors favoring the dominance of harmful algae combined with notable variability in algae biomass presents a substantial challenge for water resource managers in the u s harmful algae in large waterbodies such as lake erie has received significant research and media attention reutter et al 2011 international joint commission 2014 wines 2014 patel and parshina kottas 2017 dalton 2021 however despite similar concerns strategies for managing harmful algae in small inland waterbodies across the u s have received less attention brooks et al 2016 in the northern hemisphere algae biomass tends to peak in the late summer and early fall july october as a result of a complex array of pre season and within season physical chemical and biological processes in the midwest and northeast u s this season is characterized by warm temperatures and increased sunlight allowing for increased photosynthesis and algae productivity singh and singh 2015 in many instances significant intra and inter annual variability in peak season algae biomass is evident driven partially by local hydrology and temperature that are in turn modulated by large scale climate phenomena through atmospheric teleconnections beal et al 2021 predictions of how these algae conditions vary may benefit lake managers by allowing them to take early actions to reduce or mitigate harm caused by intense algae growth short term days to weeks predictions of chlorophyll a a proxy for algal biomass are typically issued within season and focus on expected bloom formation or toxin production allowing managers to take rapid actions to address odor and taste issues transition to alternative water sources post warning signs at beaches etc zhang et al 2013 chen et al 2015 qian et al 2021 wynne et al 2013 in contrast longer lead months pre season predictions of expected algae conditions may allow lake managers to address a different set of actions e g life guard training public awareness etc and decisions e g testing and monitoring budgets and plans together these predictions can provide decision makers with multi scale information to inform appropriate actions at various lead times however season ahead predictions for water quality have received relatively little attention longer lead predictions of oceanic chlorophyll a and inland nutrient loading have been developed with some success e g cho et al 2016 park et al 2019 rousseaux et al 2021 but little attention has been devoted to inland lakes long lead predictions of algae that do exist typically focus on singular metrics often mean biomass to characterize the potential loss of ecosystem services due to algae accumulation however further characterization may be warranted for example wilkinson et al 2021 define three metrics to characterize algae conditions including magnitude mean seasonal chlorophyll severity peak seasonal chlorophyll and duration length of time chlorophyll is above a threshold concentration in addition to information provided by mean biomass this approach provides lake managers with information that specifically addresses two key management concerns related to algae the potential for severe consequences of algae blooms such as fish kills and toxin production and length of time a lake may be unfit for recreation long lead predictions also often rely predominantly on nutrient loads as predictors stow et al 1997 lathrop et al 1998 stumpf et al 2016 however consideration of relevant hydroclimatic predictors has the potential to enhance prediction performance and expand the availability of water quality predictions to many small inland lakes beal et al 2021 there is a large and long body of evidence illustrating the impacts of external nutrient loading on phytoplankton growth in lakes vollenweider 1971 schindler 1978 reynolds 1984 elliott et al 2006 kane et al 2014 phosphorus and nitrogen are widely considered the most important nutrients for phytoplankton growth in freshwater schindler 1971 1977 transportation of phosphorus and nitrogen into a lake from the surrounding watershed is an important driver of algae abundance in many systems nutrient transport is influenced by global and local hydroclimatic variables and thus also represent important processes in determining algae abundance increased precipitation has been linked to increased fluxes of nitrogen and phosphorus sinha et al 2017 particularly in extreme precipitation events haygarth and jarvis 1997 royer et al 2006 carpenter et al 2015 2018 soil moisture conditions may also influence nutrient loading by regulating runoff potential kleinman et al 2006 liu et al 2014 finally water temperature has also been shown to control phytoplankton biomass and growth rate eppley 1972 konopka and brock 1978 robarts and zohary 1987 elliott et al 2006 liu et al 2019 trombetta et al 2021 and is closely linked to local air temperature shuter et al 1983 woolway et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 march june water temperature data are not readily available for all study lakes and are therefore not included in the final set of potential predictors in addition to management applications season ahead forecasts at scale provide a unique opportunity to understand ecological relationships between hydroclimatic variables and water quality houlahan et al 2017 in particular the relevance of global scale processes in determining algae biomass in inland lakes is not well studied several studies have identified teleconnections between large scale climate phenomena and phytoplankton dynamics in inland lakes arhonditsis et al 2004 xiao et al 2019 da rosa wieliczko et al 2021 however few studies exist that investigate the application of global climate patterns to chlorophyll a prediction in inland lakes beal et al 2021 developed a sub seasonal 2 month lead forecast of cyanobacteria biomass in lake mendota wisconsin wi conditioned on local hydroclimatic variables and teleconnections with global climate patterns a large scale analysis of season ahead predictors of algae biomass is well suited to improve the understanding of dominant climate signals related to chlorophyll a using chlorophyll a time series from 178 lakes in the northeast and midwest u s we evaluated if global and local hydroclimatic processes can be used to predict algal magnitude severity and duration in each lake using a statistical modeling and forecast validation hindcast approach specifically we address the following questions 1 do local and global sea surface temperature sst hydroclimatic variables correlate with chlorophyll metrics in a given lake 2 are skillful predictions based on these variables possible for algal magnitude duration and severity 3 can variability in forecast model performance be explained by static lake specific characteristics this modeling approach may provide insight into the role of local and global hydroclimatic variability in the development of peak season algal biomass evaluate the ability of hydroclimatic variables to provide actionable information to lake managers at a seasonal timescale and indicate which characteristics of small inland lakes make them ideal candidates for seasonal forecast development 2 materials and methods 2 1 lake characterization and selection chlorophyll a measurements sampled at the surface of the lake and analyzed following project specific protocols for each lake were obtained from lagos ne soranno et al 2017 the measurements range from 1982 to 2013 in the database but several chlorophyll timeseries were extended through 2020 by collating additional measurements from the reporting agency or program referenced in lagos ne for each lake lagos ne aggregates data from lakes located throughout the midwest and northeast u s in this region chlorophyll a tends to reach peak concentrations between july and october jaso fig 1 the data from this period were used to calculate three chlorophyll metrics magnitude severity and duration see explanation below for each lake year to adequately characterize july october chlorophyll a metrics sufficiently long observational records and frequent within season sampling are needed therefore lakes for this analysis needed at least 15 years of july october chlorophyll a measurements and a minimum sampling frequency of once every 14 days following the selection methods of wilkinson et al 2021 based on these requirements 178 lakes were identified from 10 states in the midwest michigan wisconsin minnesota ohio and missouri 64 lakes and northeast new york vermont rhode island pennsylvania and maine 114 lakes u s the chlorophyll data were log transformed for analysis to create a gaussian like distribution selected lakes had an average depth of 15 8 m min 1 2 m max 198 4 m and an average area of 1297 9 hectares min 1 4 ha max 113 496 5 ha 2 2 chlorophyll metrics to characterize and eventually predict algal conditions in each lake year during the july october season three metrics were used magnitude severity and duration of chlorophyll a as defined by wilkinson et al 2021 magnitude is the mean chlorophyll a concentration in each lake year and duration is the portion of the season during which chlorophyll a concentrations exceed a threshold concentration for recreational value based on angradi et al 2018 here the severity metric has been altered from wilkinson et al 2021 and is defined as a function of magnitude seasons in which magnitude exceeds the 95th percentile of all historical chlorophyll concentrations rather than year specific concentrations are categorized as severe on an inter annual timescale magnitude characterizes the average conditions during the peak season and the corresponding impacts on ecosystem services severity reflects the probability of extreme algae biomass magnitude that is most likely to result in severe consequences like toxin production and fish kills finally duration is the persistence of high algal biomass associated with a loss of recreational value during the summer peak season the threshold concentrations used here are developed for two ecoregions mountains and plains and vary in each region based on recreational user s expectations for water quality because these are large regions lakes that fall below or above the chlorophyll a threshold in nearly all sampling events are removed from analysis to avoid artificially inflating overall forecast skill together these metrics may provide an enhanced understanding of algae conditions during the peak season of algal production with prospects for more refined actionable information compared to a singular forecast of mean chlorophyll magnitude a forecast that additionally provides advanced warning of protracted water quality impairment duration and the potential for severe consequences of algae growth severity allows for more nuanced decision making around budgeting testing and communicating water quality expectations with the public the extent to which these three metrics are correlated with local and global climate variables and predictable across a diverse set of lakes is the focus of this work 2 3 predictor variable selection to address whether local and global hydroclimatic variables are correlated with chlorophyll metrics in a given lake we evaluate to what extent pre season march through june observations of local and global hydroclimate variables are correlated with magnitude and duration for each lake correlations for severity were not evaluated independently in this analysis as the severity metric is a function of magnitude in addition to identifying common local and global hydroclimatic variables correlated with chlorophyll metrics this analysis was used to identify variables that would be used in the development of each lake specific forecasting model and the validation of each model in a hindcasting analysis the hindcasting analysis uses the lake specific forecasting model to predict each year in the chlorophyll metric timeseries without predictor information from the year of interest simulating a forecast for model validation specifically we included march june variables from readily available gridded datasets that were connected to physical processes that may affect magnitude and duration including table 1 total precipitation mm mean air temperature c mean volumetric soil moisture m 3 m 3 the sum of daily precipitation events exceeding 20 40 mm for midwest northeast watersheds and global sea surface temperature sst anomalies c methods for evaluating sst anomalies as predictors are described below additionally we evaluated if pre season chlorophyll a which reflects in situ processes and the nutrient availability at the start of the season is correlated with peak season chlorophyll metrics excluding extreme events all metrics were averaged over the march june season as discussed previously local hydrology regulates nutrient transport into lakes from the surrounding watershed which may ultimately influence algae abundance the influence of local hydrology based candidate predictors precipitation extreme events and soil moisture may vary based on land use and topography within a lake s watershed therefore local hydrology predictors were evaluated using a correlation analysis at each grid within each lake s huc12 watershed huc12 watershed polygons watershed boundary dataset 2021 were subset to only include areas higher in elevation than the corresponding lake fig a 1 using gridded elevation data for each watershed from the elevatr package for the r statistical programming language hollister et al 2021 the timeseries of candidate predictor variables from each grid intersecting the watershed polygon was used in the correlation analysis as was an average of all intersecting grids the grid with the strongest statistically significant correlation was retained for the subsequent hindcasting analysis high precipitation events may have a more significant influence on overall nutrient loading than total precipitation carpenter et al 2015 however precipitation events that lead to large loading events may vary by region due to land use topography and nutrient availability therefore separate thresholds were chosen for extreme precipitation events in midwest 20 mm and northeast 40 mm watersheds based on a sensitivity analysis of significant correlations between high precipitation events and peak season chlorophyll a magnitude conducted for each region on a global scale pre season sea surface temperatures can influence in season precipitation and temperature over the u s through modulation of atmospheric flow and thus indirectly influence peak season chlorophyll metrics barnston 1994 giannini et al 2000 markowski and north 2003 ssts evolve slowly with persistent months to years anomalies and thus can serve well as predictors at seasonal timescales barnett 1981 to identify oceanic regions with strong teleconnections to the northeast and midwest u s global pre season sea surface temperature sst anomaly grids were correlated with each lake s magnitude timeseries fig a 2 not surprisingly correlation patterns and thus oceanic regions of influence vary between the midwest and northeast u s ropelewski and halpert 1987 cpc 1997 enfield et al 2001 tootle et al 2005 therefore identification of teleconnections is performed separately for the midwest and northeast the number of significant correlations with chlorophyll a timeseries were tallied for each sst grid and mapped to identify oceanic regions in which sst grids were associated with algae abundance in the northeast and midwest sst grids that were significantly correlated with a large fraction of lakes 10 for midwest 20 for northeast were applied to a principal component analysis pca to extract the dominant modes of variability in sst data and reduce the dimensionality of candidate sst predictors given the large number of sst grids there is a high likelihood of generating spurious correlations performing pca extracts the dominant climate signals and minimizes the effect of spuriously correlated grids principal components pcs that explained more than 5 of the variance in sst anomaly data were retained as candidate predictors the time series of variables in table 1 were used in a correlation analysis with chlorophyll magnitude and duration for each lake to identify predictor variables for forecast model development and the subsequent hindcasting analysis fig 2 for each lake all variables that were significantly correlated with the chlorophyll metric p 0 05 were retained for the forecasting model out of the 178 lakes evaluated 135 lakes 50 midwest 85 northeast had at least one significant predictor variable for magnitude and 82 lakes 30 midwest 52 northeast for duration severity is a function of magnitude and therefore retained the same set of predictors 2 4 forecast model development two forecasting models were developed for each lake one focused on magnitude including severity and a separate model for duration proportion of sampling events above the impairment threshold the array of processes and feedbacks influencing algae growth and abundance are notoriously complex roelke and buyukates 2001 glibert and burkholder 2006 ho et al 2019 motivating a statistical modeling approach over a process based physical model approach for lakes with only one significant predictor from the correlation analysis a simple linear regression between that variable and the chlorophyll metric was constructed for the model to be used in the hindcast analysis for lakes with multiple significant predictors a principal component analysis and regression approach was used to build the forecasting model pca effectively deals with any multi collinearity present between predictors and therefore does not artificially inflate predictive skill here principal components were retained for the forecast model if they explained more than 10 of the variance this modeling approach assumes relationships between candidate predictors and peak season algae metrics on a seasonal timescale to be linear however given that many drivers of algae growth on short timescales days to weeks are considered nonlinear processes model residuals were evaluated for evidence of nonlinear relationships autocorrelation was also investigated in each of the candidate predictors and algae metrics except for sst pc1 which likely captures baseline increases in the temperature of the pacific ocean less than 10 of timeseries for each variable had more than two statistically significant autocorrelations lag 1 10 additionally random forest regression a nonlinear nonparametric modeling approach was tested to determine if there were notable changes in model skill due to potential nonlinearities or autocorrelation statistical models were developed using r version 4 2 1 a leave one out cross validation approach was used to evaluate model performance for each lake and chlorophyll metric hindcasting in short for each lake the observed value from one year of the chlorophyll metrics was removed from the timeseries and the forecasting models above were used to predict the missing value this process was done iteratively for all years in the timeseries for all lakes individually and both magnitude including severity and duration a prediction ensemble was created for each peak season chlorophyll metric in a lake year based on model errors difference between observed and predicted chlorophyll metric across the hindcast at that lake ensemble members are generated from a normal distribution of errors with mean zero based on maximum likelihood estimation for each time step 100 random draws from the distribution are added to the magnitude and duration predictions to form the ensemble prediction helsel and hirsch 1992 alexander et al 2019 2 5 performance measures to assess model performance four measures were adopted correlation coefficient r2 root mean square error rmse ranked probability skill score rpss and heidke skill score hss heidke 1926 epstein 1969 hss and rpss are measures of categorical skill interpreted as a percent improvement over a reference forecast a standard forecast for hydro climate prediction is an equal odds climatological distribution of historical observations here the distribution of historical observations of chlorophyll magnitude for each lake are split into four categories representing below normal near normal above normal and severe algae conditions if no predictive information is present a probabilistic prediction of jaso magnitude would default to climatology 33 chance of below normal 33 chance of near normal conditions 28 chance of above normal and 5 chance of severe conditions similarly observations of duration are split into two categories based on mean duration to represent expected below and above normal conditions forecast models developed for magnitude and duration generate probabilistic predictions of each category that are compared against climatology equal odds this allows for a direct comparison between the forecast models developed here and a benchmark climatology model to understand the prospects for enhanced predictive skill in general prediction models outperform climatology when the predicted probability of the observed category is greater than the climatological probability e g 50 for two categories 33 for three categories hss is defined as 1 h s

forecast hss values range from to 1 where negative values represent a forecast that performs worse than climatology 0 represents no skill and 1 represents a perfect prediction model the rpss is a categorical skill score that increasingly penalizes an ensemble forecast for assigning greater probability to categories farther from the observed category the rpss uses the ranked probability score

where rpsforecast and rpsclimatology are the rps values calculated using the forecast model and the reference forecast rpss values range from to 1 where 0 represents no skill and 1 represents a perfect forecast rpss values are calculated for each year and the median value is reported finally we evaluated if variability in hindcast model performance forecasting skill among lakes was related

1 leading algae characteristic predictors the three most frequently retained predictors include pre season chlorophyll a pc1 from ssts and extreme events for magnitude models the most frequently retained predictors for duration models include pre season chlorophyll a and pc1 and pc2 based on ssts pcs derived from ssts typically represent dominant large scale climate signals potential physical processes are explored further in the discussion magnitude and duration metrics are uncorrelated in most lakes only 11are significantly correlated at the 95 confidence level suggesting unique seasonal drivers for each metric in most lakes compared to magnitude models duration models have a more even distribution of retained predictors fig 3 in magnitude models pre season chlorophyll a meets the selection criteria in 63 of models sst pc1 in 42 of models and extreme events in 16 in duration models sst pc2 is selected in 38 of models sst pc1 in 33 and pre season chlorophyll a in 20 in both magnitude and duration models all three predictors are unlikely to appear in the same model suggesting variable influence of these processes by lake in magnitude models all three of the most frequently retained predictors are included in 7 of lakes in contrast one of the three predictors in included in 87 of magnitude models in duration models all three of the most frequently retained predictors are included for only two lakes 2 5 while one of the three predictors is included in 71 of duration models preseason sst grids that are statistically significantly correlated with chlorophyll a timeseries from at least 20 10 lakes are retained for the northeast midwest region fig 4 sst regions retained for both midwest and northeast lakes indicate teleconnection signals from the northern atlantic and the equatorial pacific for midwestern lakes more grids are retained in the mid and northern atlantic compared to the pacific comparatively the strongest signals for northeastern lakes are split more evenly between the upper atlantic and the equatorial pacific while local hydroclimatic predictors are present in a significant proportion of magnitude and duration models in most instances they are retained with ssts or pre season chlorophyll a particularly in magnitude models some combination of local hydroclimatic predictors precipitation extreme events soil moisture and air temperature are retained in 27 of magnitude prediction models while just 9 of magnitude models utilize only local hydroclimatic predictors i e without sst pcs or preseason chlorophyll a compared to magnitude models a larger proportion of duration models are built solely with local hydroclimatic variables hydroclimatic predictors are retained in 38 duration models and 22 of models are built exclusively with hydroclimatic predictors fig a 3 finally 86 of lakes have 1 or 2 significant predictors while the maximum number of predictors retained for a lake is 5 fig a 4 3 2 model performance for magnitude prediction models simple linear regression single predictor is applied to 53 of lakes whereas principal component regression pcr principal component analysis with multiple linear repression is applied to 47 of lakes a cross validated hindcast assessment for all lakes results in a mean r2 value of 0 28 0 0 85 and a mean rmse of 0 47 0 29 1 21 for categorical performance the mean hss and rpss values are 0 17 and 0 10 respectively additionally 87 70 of lake models have hss rpss values greater than zero indicating an improvement of prediction skill over climatology for most lakes further these models predict above normal and below normal algae abundance moderately well fig 5 with rpss values of 0 39 and 0 30 respectively severe events prove difficult to predict approximately 51 of magnitude models accurately predict an above normal or severe year when an elevated algae event is observed i e not below or near normal for more than half of observed elevated algae events fig 6 for duration prediction models simple linear regression is applied to 78 of lakes and pcr to 22 of lakes mean r2 and rmse are 0 23 0 0 65 and 0 34 0 16 0 42 respectively mean hss and rpss scores are 0 39 and 0 42 respectively and 96 94 of models improve over climatology based on hss rpss in a hindcast assessment durations of above normal are correctly predicted for more than half the available timeseries in 87 of lakes fig 6 additionally considering all models 67 of above normal durations are accurately predicted fig 5 a stark improvement over climatology for most lakes average model skill is similar between regions is similar however northeast lake forecast models outperform midwest lake models where differences in average skill scores occur fig 7 this may be expected given that the primary difference in predictor selection between models in the northeast and midwest is selection of relevant sst grids relevant northeast sst regions are more coherent than regions for the midwest which may represent a stronger influence on lake processes the minimal differences may also point to consistency in the predictive power of local and within lake variables between the northeast and midwest to evaluate the presence of nonlinear relationships residuals between predicted and observed chlorophyll metrics were investigated for each lake residuals generally appeared random suggesting that the relationships between the pre season drivers and peak season chlorophyll metrics investigated for this analysis can be approximated as linear hindcasts were also generated using random forest regression to test for an increase in predictive skill which may indicate the presence of nonlinear relationships random forests models were created with the same predictors selected for pcr each with 500 trees cross validated hindcast results are similar or slightly worse than pcr for both magnitude mean r2 0 25 rmse 0 48 hss 0 12 rpss 0 04 and duration mean r2 0 23 rmse 0 34 hss 0 34 rpss 0 39 suggesting that pcr is a suitable approach 4 discussion 4 1 regional characteristics predictions of peak season algae growth at scale provide insights into relevant global and local scale processes setting the conditions for peak season algae biomass pre season ssts and chlorophyll a observations provide the most predictive power for both magnitude and duration metrics reflecting the importance of these scales however while ssts and chlorophyll a are selected most frequently as predictors for both magnitude and duration the importance of each predictor is mixed by region fig 8 given that sst atmosphere teleconnections typically have regional influence spatial variability in performance of sst predictors may be the result of localized pre season processes superseding the influence of large scale climatic processes in peak season algae biomass for example food web dynamics are well established as having significant influence on aquatic primary productivity lampert et al 1986 carpenter et al 1987 vanni and temte 1990 in this study however the representation of food web dynamics is limited to pre season algae abundance while this variable is shown to be a powerful predictor of peak season productivity in many lakes the effect of pre season predatory control on algae communities is unrepresented this may limit the skill of prediction models for lakes in which zooplankton grazing plays a significant role in determining algae populations in the summer and early fall this limitation may be responsible for differences in average model performance for example magnitude and duration models in which pre season chlorophyll a is an important predictor and ssts are not perform worse on average than the inverse table 2 lakes retaining only pre season chlorophyll a may be more dependent on within lake processes many of which are not represented in these models this may explain the less robust predictive signal from pre season chlorophyll a in these lakes compared to lakes more heavily influenced by sst atmosphere teleconnections as discussed previously relevant sst anomaly grids are identified for the northeast and midwest separately the pcs of selected sst anomaly grids represent the dominant climate signals affecting the selected lakes across the northeast and midwest u s and may therefore be associated with large scale climate phenomena that have well established teleconnections with climate conditions across north america two dominant climate phenomena with variable impacts on local hydroclimatic conditions across the northeast and midwest include the north atlantic oscillation nao and the el niño southern oscillation enso ropelewski and halpert 1987 visbeck et al 2001 in the northeast two of the three sst pcs used as potential predictors are significantly correlated with both the nao index and multivariate enso index mei in the midwest two pcs are significantly correlated with the mei and all three are significantly correlated with the nao index this suggests that interannual variability in local climate and in lakes across the northeast and midwest is associated with both enso and nao like climate signals fig a 5 compared to pre season chlorophyll and ssts other variables considered here provide only modest skill in predicting algae characteristics for most lakes despite the perceived importance of local land and hydrologic variables modulating inflow and lake processes few were retained as predictors however land use and other watershed characteristics may be important in determining the relevance of these predictors local hydrology might be expected to play a larger role in promoting algae growth in agricultural watersheds given the effect of runoff on nutrient loading castillo et al 2000 mander et al 2000 this is reflected in predictor selection for model construction for example magnitude models in watersheds with greater than 25 agricultural land are nearly twice as likely to retain a local hydrologic predictor compared to models in watersheds with less agricultural land 18 4 vs 36 march june air temperatures are also retained in relatively few forecasting models overall but are notably included in more duration models than any of the local hydrologic predictors as discussed previously the importance of temperature in determining algae growth is well established however the air temperature predictor included here may be too simplistic to capture the relationship across all lakes significant variability in prediction skill exists among lakes with little evidence of spatial patterns on average skill scores are higher in the northeast compared to the midwest however variability within both regions is significant the frequency of predictor retention and the average magnitude of significant correlations between predictor variables and algae magnitude are similar by region particularly for the most frequently selected predictors including ssts pre season chlorophyll a and extreme events within 0 05 sst pc1 and extreme events in the northeast have slightly higher correlations with algae magnitude than in the midwest which may help explain slightly higher model skill scores in the northeast the magnitude of correlation between predictor variables and algae duration is also similar however sst pc2 is retained much more often in northeast models compared to midwest models 25 of lakes vs 5 of lakes given that sst pc2 is correlated with the nao this might indicate a greater influence of the nao on duration in the northeast and help explain the slightly higher skill scores of duration models in the northeast similarly distributions of skill scores across trophic state and lake area are variable fig 9 on average magnitude models appear to accurately predict increased algae abundances more frequently in larger lakes and in mesotrophic and oligotrophic lakes duration models have approximately equal distributions of skill across lake area and trophic state while the differences in magnitude model skill based on lake area and tsi category are notable they were found to be statistically insignificant in an analysis of variance anova lake area p 0 24 tsi p 0 36 therefore it may be difficult to draw definitive conclusions from these results there are a few potential explanations for the variability in magnitude model performance in an analysis of lake size and primary productivity in the canadian shield lakes fee et al 1994 found that larger lakes more efficiently convert external nutrient loads into phytoplankton biomass due to more frequent resuspension of sediments and receive a higher proportion of nutrient loads from runoff rather than direct precipitation the focus in this analysis on hydroclimatic predictors of nutrient runoff is therefore consistent with increased predictive skill in larger lakes notably air temperature did not stand out as an important predictor of algae abundance at a season ahead lead time as discussed previously temperature is well established as an important variable in algae growth in some cases warm temperatures have been shown to hold greater influence over phytoplankton growth salmaso et al 2012 and cyanobacteria growth in eutrophic lakes rigosi et al 2014 the air temperature predictor used here may be too simplistic to capture peak season water temperatures which may disproportionately contribute to lower model performance in eutrophic lakes rusak et al 2018 found a positive relationship between variability of chlorophyll a and trophic status in 18 globally distributed lakes which may also reduce predictability cottingham et al 2000 this may explain the moderate reduction in average skill in magnitude models for eutrophic lakes compared to lakes of a lower trophic status variability in prediction skill can also exist between similar or proximal lakes mariaville lake and duansespurg reservoir are two eutrophic waterbodies located in eastern new york approximately five miles apart mariaville lake has one of the best performing magnitude prediction models among the lakes considered and accurately predicts above normal and severe chlorophyll a conditions for each of the five years in which they are observed comparatively duansespurg reservoir only correctly predicts two out of six observed events fig 10 in 1999 for example the mariaville lake model accurately predicts a large probability of above normal conditions observed state and is even able to differentiate between above normal and severe comparatively for the same year the duansepurg model only predicts a 1 chance of below normal conditions observed state and both models predict an approximately 80 chance of above normal or severe conditions in 1999 77 mariaville 85 duanespurg the mariaville lake model includes ssts pc1 and pre season chlorophyll a as predictors whereas the duansespurg model includes only ssts pc2 the performance of the duanespurg model compared to the mariaville model again suggests that while global processes are important in setting conditions for peak season algae biomass and both explain significant variability in the magnitude timeseries of both lakes within lake processes that may determine interannual variability of peak season algae abundance are not entirely captured by the hydroclimatic predictors investigated here or by pre season algae abundance the variability in forecast skill and predictive power of hydroclimatic variables among study lakes highlights the importance of catchment and lake specific processes and characteristics in determining the effects of external climate forcing on peak season algae abundance catchment soil types land use and location as well as lake area depth and management may all influence the susceptibility of lake systems to climate variables moss 2012 and may alter predictive skill while forecasting models developed on the selected pre season predictors cannot entirely capture the nuances of peak season algae biomass it is notable that relatively simplistic statistical models based on global sea surface temperatures and pre season chlorophyll a show significant skill in many of the selected lakes for these lakes season ahead prediction of algae metrics may provide actionable information to lake managers and public health officials based on easily accessible gridded datasets and basic water quality monitoring 5 conclusions in this paper season ahead predictions for july october algae magnitude and duration are developed for 135 lakes identified across the northeast and midwest u s to inform lake management decisions prior to peak algae biomass prediction models are conditioned on local and global scale pre season march june readily available gridded hydroclimatic variables and pre season chlorophyll a global sst and pre season chlorophyll a are the most common sources of predictive power across lake models sst grids selected for prediction model development are concentrated in the northern atlantic and equatorial pacific with characteristics of both enso and nao forecasting models outperform climatology in 87 70 of magnitude models and in 96 94 of duration models based on hss rpss additionally skillful prediction of elevated algae metrics based on magnitude and duration is evident in more than half of the included lakes

15199,the widespread use of chlorination cl2 in drinking water systems causes the selection of chlorine resistant bacteria commonly with dense extracellular polymeric substance eps against chlorine permeation posing significant threat to public health herein a nanowire assisted electroporation ep via locally enhanced electric field was combined with cl2 to construct the synergistic ep cl2 disinfection with the purposes of inducing cell pores for chlorine permeation and bacterial inactivation the synergistic effects of ep cl2 were observed for inactivation of chlorine resistant bacillus cereus g 304 μg doc eps 109 cfu and aeromonas media g 35 8 μg and chlorine sensitive escherichia coli g 5 1 μg that were frequent occurrence in drinking water systems the ep cl2 enabled above 6 log b cereus inactivation undetectable live bacteria at 1 5 v ep and 0 9 mg l cl2 which was much higher than the individual ep 1 11 log and cl2 1 13 log disinfection the cell membrane integrity intracellular free chlorine levels and morphology analyses revealed that the electroporation induced pores on cell wall membrane destructed the bound eps barrier for chlorine permeation and the pore sizes were further enlarged by chlorine oxidation hence facilitating bacterial inactivation via destroying the cell structures the excellent disinfection performance for tap water and lake water also suggested its sound application potentials graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords chlorine resistant bacteria electroporation chlorine permeation cell membrane integrity cell destruction data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction drinking water safety has become a global concern while the control of pathogenic microorganisms is one of the most essential issues in water quality and safety nixdorff et al 2021 wallmann et al 2021 chlorine disinfection hclo clo2 and nh2cl due to the strong sterilizing ability and low cost has been recognized as one of the most common disinfection techniques in addition it can maintain a certain level of residual chlorine for substantial inhibition of microbial regrowth over a long time and distance in distribution systems until the point of use how et al 2017 nihemaiti et al 2020 nevertheless a critical issue associated with chlorination is the widespread use of chlorine has promoted the selection of chlorine resistant bacteria hu et al 2021 li et al 2013 which can cause the microorganism regrowth and biofilm formation in pipe networks threatening the public health ding et al 2019 zhao et al 2020 therefore it is of great significance to explore measures for controlling the chlorine resistant bacteria in drinking water systems luo et al 2021a the bacterial inactivation mechanisms by chlorine disinfectants are related to the oxidative damage of cell membrane for cell permeabilization or the permeation into cells for oxidizing intracellular functional components enzyme or dna cho et al 2010 it was well studied that the chlorine resistant bacteria generally tended to secrete more extracellular polymeric substances eps bound on cell surface than the chlorine sensitive ones luo et al 2022 wang et al 2019 which serve as barriers against chlorine permeation or as reactive substances for chlorine consumption ekundayo et al 2021 therefore it is highly desirable to develop strategy that can promote chlorine permeation into cells thereby ensuring the sufficient exposure to chlorine for the inactivation efficiency of chlorine resistant bacteria alternative methods via combining chlorination with ultraviolet uv radiations such as uv cl2 li et al 2018 uv free chlorine liu et al 2019 and uv nh2cl wu et al 2022 were developed to enhance the disinfection performance which were mainly attributed to the generation of hydroxyl radicals and reactive chlorine species with much higher oxidation capacities than chlorine chemicals in addition to achieve a certain disinfection performance the combined disinfection methods can lower the required chlorine dosage in turn reducing the formation of chlorinated disinfection byproducts cerreta et al 2020 yan et al 2022 however with the main oxidation mechanisms the efficiencies of these combined methods for chlorine resistant bacteria inactivation were still limited by the oxidative competition of eps barrier with the physics of lightning rod effect on nanowires the electric field over their sharp tips can be enhanced by several orders of magnitude inspired by this phenomenon electroporation disinfection equipped by electrodes with nanowire arrays was developed to inactivate various gram positive negative g bacteria by the locally enhanced electric field under low voltage driving 3 v huo et al 2016 pi et al 2021 under exposure to electric field over 105 v m the lipid bilayer will be rearranged to form irreversible or reversible pores leading to bacterial inactivation via membrane damage or serious cytoplasm leakage yusupov et al 2017 zhou et al 2021 as a physical disinfection method the nanowire assisted electroporation has excellent operation stability in complex water matrix huo et al 2019a suggesting the insignificant effect of eps competitive oxidation on electroporation disinfection however the individual electroporation without sufficient reactive species generation limits its application for drinking water storage and distribution due to the lack of continuous disinfection ability besides the lethal electroporation pores for bacterial inactivation reversible electroporation pores with slight cytoplasm leakage also occurred under insufficient electric field exposure which can be resealed in several minutes due to the fluidity of lipid membrane without loss of the microbial activity it was revealed that the treatment of bacillus pumilus pillet et al 2016 saccharomyces cerevisiae stirke et al 2019 and chlamydomonas reinhardtii bensalem et al 2020 cells with strong electric fields also caused the unrecoverable pores on the rigid cell wall the electroporation induced pores on cell wall and membrane may destruct the dense eps layer bound on cell hence it can be deduced that via combining the electroporation and chlorination the reversible electroporation induced cell pores can provide chlorine permeation channels for facilitating chlorine resistant bacteria inactivation herein synergistic co3o4 nanowire assisted ep and cl2 ep cl2 was constructed to study the synergistic effects and mechanisms for bacterial inactivation with chlorine sensitive escherichia coli e coli g for comparison purposes bacillus cereus b cereus g and aeromonas media a media g were selected as the targeted chlorine resistant strains because of their high chlorine resistances and frequent occurrence in water treatment systems luo et al 2022 wang et al 2021 the synergistic effects of ep cl2 were investigated as functions of ep voltages and chlorine dosages and compared with the sequential ep and cl2 ep cl2 and the individual cl2 and ep methods the synergistic mechanisms were elaborated from the aspects of cell permeability morphology and intracellular chlorine levels the application potentials of synergistic ep cl2 were also investigated for the real water resources 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and chemicals all the chemicals used in this study were analytical reagents and purchased from mackin shanghai china including sodium hypochlorite naclo sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate dopamine hydrochloride tris hydroxymethyl aminoethane cobalt nitrate hexahydrate ammonium fluoride and carbamide graphite felts gf were purchased from liaoning jingu carbon material co ltd china as porous substrates for synthesis of nanowire modified electrodes all aqueous solutions were prepared with deionized di water resistance 18 2 mω cm 2 2 bacterial cultivation and enumeration the model chlorine resistant bacterial strains bacillus cereus b cereus g genbank number mw789846 and aeromonas media a media g mw790028 were screened from a water treatment plant in beijing luo et al 2022 and a chlorine sensitive bacterial strain escherichia coli e coli g cgmcc 1 3373 was used for comparison purposes which were frequent occurrence in drinking water systems ding et al 2019 luo et al 2021b the chlorine resistances of b cereus a media and e coli were identified via the chlorine disinfection experiments fig s1 and table s1 the b cereus and a media were cultured in luria bertani lb broth with shaking at 25 c and 180 rpm for 16 h until 2 108 cfu ml the e coli was cultured in nutrient broth nb at 37 c and 180 rpm for 16 h until 3 109 cfu ml the bacterial cells were collected by centrifugation at 10 000 rpm for 5 min and the remaining bacterial pellet was resuspended using sterile di water for two times to remove the residual broth for bacterial enumeration each sample was serially diluted with 0 9 sterile saline then 100 1000 μl samples were uniformly plated on lb or nb agar plates the agar plates were incubated overnight at 25 or 37 c to determine the concentration of culturable bacteria with detect limitation of 1 cfu ml 2 3 nanowire electrode fabrication and electroporation ep device construction the co3o4 nanowire arrays modified gf electrodes co3o4nws were fabricated via hydrothermal and calcination methods according to our previous work pi et al 2022 briefly six pieces of gf substrates with 5 mm in thickness and 25 mm in diameter were immersed in 60 ml solution of 70 mm co no3 2 350 mm co nh2 2 and 140 mm nh4f followed by heating in a 100 ml teflon lined stainless steel autoclave at 120 c for 10 h after fully cleaning with di water the materials were annealed at 400 c for 2 h in a muffle furnace to avoid the catalytic decomposition of naclo into cl and o2 species by co3o4 kim et al 2012 the co3o4nws electrodes were deposited by nano sized polydopamine coating according to our previous work huo et al 2019b briefly 6 pieces of co3o4nws electrodes were immersed in 150 ml solution with 10 mm dopamine hydrochloride and 10 mm tris ph of 8 5 for 4 or 8 h at 40 c fabricating co3o4nws 4 h and co3o4nws 8 h electrodes fig s2 the electroporation ep device with a flow through mode was constructed by assembling a conic water distributor a conic water collector a cathode chamber and an anode chamber fig s3 the electrode chambers had the same sizes as the nanowire electrodes for parallelly settling the electrodes which were separated by a piece of filter paper pore sizes 80 120 μm to avoid the short circuit titanium rods were used to connect the electrodes with an adjustable dc power supply in our preliminary experiments chlorine decomposition and b cereus inactivation by the ep devices with co3o4nws co3o4nws 4 h and co3o4nws 8 h electrodes were compared in fig s4 the chlorine decomposition by the electrodes was evaluated via pumping the chlorine solution 0 5 or 0 9 mg l without bacteria addition flow through the ep devices at 500 l m2 h without applying voltage and the chlorine decomposition was obtained by the differences of chlorine concentration in ep influent and effluent with pumping 0 9 mg l chlorine solution only 0 05 0 07 mg l chlorine were decomposed by the ep devices with co3o4nws 4 h and co3o4nws 8 h electrodes which were much lower than that with the raw co3o4nws electrode 0 63 mg l nevertheless the electric field can be only enhanced near the nanowire tips and the polydopamine coating with low conductivity can act as an obstacle for the locally enhanced electric field hence as compared with the ep with co3o4nws electrode the decrease in b cereus inactivation was observed for co3o4nws 4 h 0 06 0 08 log decrease and co3o4nws 8 h 0 2 0 3 log decrease electrodes considering the chlorine consumption and disinfection performance the co3o4nws 4 h electrode was elected as nanowire electrode for ep disinfection 2 4 disinfection procedure by the combination process of ep and cl2 for the individual ep disinfection 106 cfu ml bacteria in di water was continuously pumped into the ep device at flux of 500 l m2 h by a peristaltic pump and the effluent was collected to measure the culturable bacterial concentrations for the individual chlorination cl2 25 ml naclo solution was added into 25 ml bacterial suspension with final concentrations of 0 2 1 2 mg l in 100 ml conical flask after shaking at 180 rpm for 30 min in darkness the residual chlorine concentration was measured with n n diethyl p phenylenediamine method and the residual chlorine was quenched with sodium thiosulfate to measure the culturable bacterial concentrations according to combination modes of ep and cl2 the sequential ep and cl2 ep cl2 and synergistic ep and cl2 ep cl2 processes were constructed fig 1 for the ep cl2 25 ml effluent of ep device was collected followed by the cl2 disinfection for the ep cl2 the bacterial suspension and naclo solution were mixed evenly through the y shaped tube and pumped into the ep device the ep effluent was collected and shaken at 180 rpm for 30 min in darkness followed by measuring the residual chlorine and culturable bacterial concentrations the bacterial inactivation by the ep lo g ep cl2 lo g c l 2 ep cl2 lo g ep c l 2 and ep cl2 lo g ep c l 2 and the synergistic effects of the ep cl2 and ep cl2 were calculated as the logarithmic reduction using the following equations 1 log inactivation log n 0 n f 2 synergistic effect lo g ep c l 2 or lo g ep c l 2 lo g c l 2 lo g ep where the n0 and nf were the culturable bacterial concentrations before and after disinfection for the typical disinfection processes in fig s5 the ep and ep cl2 exhibited slight decrease in bacterial inactivation due to the interception of cells in porous electrodes within 10 min and maintained the operation stability in the next 50 min suggesting that the over 10 min operation time was required for sampling the ep and ep cl2 effluent solutions all experiments were conducted in triplicate and the data were expressed as the mean values with error bars 2 5 flow cytometry analyses for cell integrity and intracellular free chlorine levels the bacterial cell membrane integrities before and after disinfection were analyzed with a flow cytometry beckman gallios using fluorescent staining dyes film tracer sigma of syto 9 and propidium iodide pi bacterial suspensions 106 cfu ml were stained with syto 9 5 µm and pi 45 µm for 30 min in darkness to detect the intracellular free chlorine levels bacterial suspensions were washed by centrifugation and resuspension with pbs solution to remove the residual chlorine then 1 ml solution was stained with 10 mm 2 7 dichlorofluorescein diacetate dcfh da solarbio at 37 c for 20 min followed by washing with pbs twice to remove the excess dcfh da about 10 000 cells were counted for each analysis 2 6 sem analyses of cell morphology the bacterial morphologies before and after disinfection were characterized with a scanning electron microscopy fe sem hitachi s 8010 the bacterial cells were collected by centrifugation and then fixed in 2 5 glutaraldehyde solution at 4 c for overnight the fixed cells were washed with pbs for three times and then sequentially dehydrated by 30 50 70 80 90 and 100 ethanol with each step for 10 min immersion after replacing the solution with tert butanol the samples were freeze dried and sprayed by gold sputter before sem analysis 2 7 operation performance of ep cl2 for real water resources the disinfection performance of ep cl2 was investigated by using tap water and lake water within continuous operation time of 60 h the lake water was pretreated by filtration with 0 22 μm membrane to remove the indigenous bacteria and the basic water qualities of di water tap water and lake water were listed in table s2 the chlorine resistant bacteria polluted water samples were prepared by diluting the b cereus suspension with the tap water or lake water to a final concentration of 106 cfu ml the concentrations of cobalt particles and ions in ep cl2 effluent were measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes to evaluate the electrode stability the detached and dissolved co3o4 nanowires were distinguished with or without acidizing the effluent solution 10 mm h2so4 3 results and discussion 3 1 disinfection performance by the combination processes of ep and cl2 as shown in fig 2 for the cl2 disinfection the log inactivation of chlorine resistant b cereus and a media was much lower than the chlorine sensitive e coli for instance under 0 5 mg l chlorine only 0 58 log b cereus inactivation and 1 24 log a media inactivation were achieved whereas 4 68 log e coli inactivation was obtained the ct90 values by 0 5 mg l cl2 disinfection were 7 98 b cereus 3 95 a media and 0 38 mg l min e coli text s1 and table s1 as compared with e coli cells 5 1 μg doc 109 cfu a dense and tightly bound eps layer on b cereus 304 μg doc 109 cfu and a media 35 8 μg doc 109 cfu cells were observed text s2 resulting in their distinct chlorine resistance luo et al 2022 for the 1 0 v ep disinfection the b cereus a media and e coli exhibited similar inactivation 1 log resulting from the physical disinfection mechanisms via locally enhanced electric field as shown in fig 2a and b the synergistic effects of ep cl2 0 2 2 1 log and ep cl2 0 5 3 0 log for b cereus inactivation were apparently observed especially achieving above 6 log inactivation undetectable live cells with limit of detection 1 cfu ml by ep cl2 at 1 0 v ep and 1 2 mg l cl2 for ep disinfection only ep induced lethal pores on cell membrane contributed to bacterial inactivation while some reversible pores can be resealed gradually within several minutes after ep treatment without loss of cell viability kotnik et al 2015 the strong electric field can also induce irrecoverable destruction of cell walls pillet et al 2016 which may damage the tightly bound eps layer more evidence can be found in the following sections hence for ep cl2 and ep cl2 the live cells with reversible electroporation were subjected to the destruction of cell wall and the bound eps layer which can facilitate chlorine permeation to achieve the synergistic effects for b cereus inactivation the chlorine decay in fig s6 also revealed that the ep cl2 0 67 mg l and ep cl2 0 77 mg l exhibited much more chlorine consumption than the cl2 disinfection 0 42 mg l the ep cl2 exhibited 0 3 0 9 log lower b cereus inactivation than ep cl2 which can be attributed to that the reversible membrane pores were resealed during collecting the ep effluent for subsequent cl2 disinfection with increasing the chlorine dosages the synergistic effects of ep cl2 for b cereus inactivation exhibited an increase then decrease trend with the maximum value of 3 0 log at 1 0 v ep and 0 9 mg l cl2 which can be ascribed to the limited reversible pores by the constant electroporation strength at 1 0 v the synergistic effects of ep cl2 were also observed for inactivating a media g fig 2c e coli g fig 2d as well as for b cereus g suspensions with concentrations of 105 and 5 106 cfu ml fig s7 the synergistic effects of ep cl2 for the bacterial inactivation followed an order of b cereus 0 5 3 0 log a media 0 3 2 5 log e coli 0 2 1 2 log which was in agreement with the orders of their eps contents and chlorine resistances and also supported the eps layer on the cells as chlorine permeation barrier in addition with coupling the 1 0 v ep with 0 5 mg l cl2 disinfection the ct90 values decreased from 7 98 to 0 47 for b cereus from 3 95 to 0 41 for a media and from 0 38 to 0 11 mg l min e coli which suggested that electroporation promoted the chlorine permeation for bacterial inactivation fig s8 and table s1 the synergistic effects of ep cl2 for inactivating these g and chlorine resistant sensitive bacteria suggested its sound potentials for controlling microbiological risks in water in the following study b cereus with significant chlorine resistance was selected for further investigating the synergistic disinfection mechanisms of ep cl2 3 2 effect of applied voltages on ep cl2 disinfection the disinfection performance of ep cl2 was further evaluated with 0 9 mg l cl2 and ep voltages from 0 2 to 1 5 v as shown in fig 3 a b cereus inactivation by ep increased gradually with increasing the applied voltages achieving 1 1 log inactivation at 1 5 v similar results were also reported that higher voltages promoted the formation of strong electric field near nanowire tips in turn enhancing the electroporation disinfection performance huo et al 2016 with increasing the ep voltages the ep cl2 exhibited significantly increase in the b cereus inactivation and the synergistic effects which achieved above 6 log b cereus inactivation with synergistic effect of 3 7 log at 1 5 v ep and 0 9 mg l cl2 this phenomenon can be attributed to that the higher voltages also induced more non lethal cells with reversible electroporation wang et al 2022 thereby enhancing the synergistic effects of ep cl2 to overcome the eps barrier for chlorine permeation into the cells after cl2 ep and ep cl2 disinfection the water samples were stored for 24 h to evaluate the cell viability as shown in fig 3b after ep cl2 disinfection at 1 5 v ep and 0 9 mg l cl2 with above 6 log inactivation no regrowth and reactivation of b cereus cells occurred during storage also the survival cells after disinfection gradually died during storage with more obvious cell death than the untreated sample the b cereus concentration of untreated sample decreased from 106 to 2 105 cfu ml with 20 viability fig s9 whereas below 5 viabilities were found for the samples after cl2 from 75000 to 2900 cfu ml ep from 90000 to 810 cfu ml and ep cl2 from 11 to 0 cfu ml disinfection these results indicated that some live b cereus cells were impaired after disinfection causing their inactivation during storage 3 3 cell membrane integrity and intracellular free chlorine levels a cell permeable fluorescent stain syto 9 labeling cells with intact or impaired membranes and a cell impermeable stain pi only labeling cells with impaired membranes were used to investigate the cell membrane integrity in this work 45 µm pi with higher dna binding affinity was used to quench syto 9 signal 5 µm for distinguishing the slightly impaired cells or seriously damaged cells mao et al 2021 sun et al 2019 as shown in fig 4 fluorescence dot plots were divided into four quadrants intact cells only stained by syto 9 in q 1 slightly impaired cells stained by syto 9 and pi in q 2 seriously damaged cells only stained by pi in q 3 and unstained cell debris in q 4 lv et al 2017 for untreated b cereus suspensions 96 8 cells were located in q 1 with 1 9 cells in q 2 suggesting almost cells with intact membranes fig 4a1 via staining the ep effluents from 0 5 1 0 v the proportion of cells in q 2 increased to 42 5 57 0 fig 4a1 a4 which was in agreement with the results in fig 3a that the higher voltages promoted cell inactivation via irreversible electroporation to recognize the reversible electroporation the ep influent was also stained with syto 9 and pi followed by ep disinfection hence the pi can permeate into the cells via the reversible membrane pores pore sizes larger than pi molecules before pore resealing and the reversible pores can be evaluated by the differences in pi signals via staining the ep influents and effluents for the ep disinfection at 0 v 96 5 cells were located in the q 1 fig 4b1 indicating the limited cell damage by the sharp structure of nanowires as compared with the stained ep effluents 42 5 57 0 cells in q 2 fig 4a2 a4 26 3 36 9 higher cell proportions in q 2 were observed for the stained ep influents 68 8 93 9 fig 4b2 b4 these results reflected that a large part of live cells after ep disinfection were suffered from reversible electroporation and the free chlorine with smaller size than pi molecule can also permeate into the cells via these reversible pores thereby promoting the b cereus inactivation zhao et al 2022 as shown in fig 4c1 after 0 9 mg l cl2 disinfection 62 6 cells had intact cell membranes with 90 inactivation 1 log inactivation resulting from that free chlorine mainly attacked intracellular functional components for bacterial inactivation without causing significant cell damage cho et al 2010 for the ep cl2 disinfection fig 4c2 c4 the fluorescent signals shifted significantly to q 2 and q 3 indicating that the synergistic effects of ep cl2 caused more serious membrane damage for instance the ep cl2 at 0 5 v ep and 0 9 mg l cl2 98 6 exhibited 19 0 more cells in q 2 than the cells summation in q 2 after the individual ep 42 5 and cl2 37 1 disinfection these results were also in agreement with the analyses of intracellular free chlorine levels fig s10 as compared with the 0 9 mg l cl2 disinfection 27 4 the 0 5 1 5v ep cl2 exhibited much more positive cells with intracellular free chlorine 41 1 79 3 based on the above analyses the electroporation induced pores on cell wall membrane destructed the bound eps for enhancing chlorine permeation into the cells and the subsequent chlorine oxidation promoted the damage of electroporation induced pores for bacterial inactivation 3 4 synergistic disinfection mechanisms of ep cl2 for cell structure damage the sem images of b cereus cells before and after ep cl2 and ep cl2 disinfection are shown in fig 5 after individual ep disinfection small irreversible pores were presented on the cells which provided strong evidence that the locally enhanced electric field of nanowires damaged the cell wall membrane and the tightly bound eps layer after individual 0 9 mg l cl2 disinfection insignificant cell damages were observed with the slight loss of some threadlike and loosely bound eps due to the chlorine oxidation for the synergistic ep cl2 disinfection the b cereus cell structures were significantly disrupted with much larger pores on the cells than that after individual ep treatment and the higher ep voltages promoted the cell destruction due to the enhanced electric field near nanowire tips these results further supported that the electroporation induced pores provided channels for chlorine permeation into the cells and the electroporation induced pore sizes were enlarged by the chlorine oxidation based on the analyses about the cell membrane integrity intracellular free chlorine levels and cell morphology the synergistic mechanisms of ep cl2 for inactivation of chlorine resistant bacteria were illustrated in fig 6 with g bacterium as example for the individual cl2 disinfection the dense eps layer on cell prevented chlorine permeation into the cells significantly limiting the bacterial inactivation for individual ep disinfection some chlorine resistant bacteria exposed to the strong electric field near nanowire tips were inactivated by the lethal irreversible reversible electroporation with serious cytoplasm leakage which was accompanied by some survival cells with the non lethal reversible pores the strong electric field also induced the destruction of the cell walls and the bound eps layer therefore for the synergistic ep cl2 disinfection non lethal reversible pores provided chlorine permeation channels to overcome the eps barrier and the chlorine oxidation further enlarged the electroporation induced pores hence enhancing the bacterial inactivation via destroying the cell structures 3 5 application potentials of ep cl2 disinfection the disinfection performance of ep cl2 was evaluated by using the real water resources tap water and lake water fig 7 the individual 0 9 mg l cl2 disinfection achieved 1 1 log b cereus inactivation for the di water and tap water whereas much lower b cereus inactivation 0 67 log was obtained for the lake water due to the competitive oxidation of organic matters for chlorine consumption fig s11 zhao et al 2006 for the individual ep disinfection insignificant differences in b cereus inactivation were observed for the di water tap water and lake water resulting from the physical disinfection mechanisms of electroporation huo et al 2019a the synergistic effects of ep cl2 were also achieved and increased obviously with the applied voltages for b cereus inactivation in the tap water and lake water fig 7 with 0 9 mg l cl2 the ep cl2 exhibited similar b cereus inactivation for the di water and tap water with above 6 log inactivation at 1 5 v ep and 0 9 mg l cl2 which was higher than the b cereus inactivation in lake water 4 6 log due to its high pollutant contents for chlorine consumption further increasing chlorine dosage to 1 2 mg l the disinfection performance of ep cl2 for lake water significantly increased with achieving undetectable live b cereus at 1 2 v ep cl2 in addition the ep cl2 for tap water and lake water disinfection showed much lower energy consumption than the individual ep and cl2 disinfection text s3 and table s3 for example as compared with the individual ep 5 80 j l log and cl2 5 01 j l log for lake water disinfection the ep cl2 1 2 v and 1 2 mg l cl2 had much lower energy consumption 3 74 j l log the ep cl2 also exhibited excellent operation stability for treating the tap water and lake water within continuous operation time of 60 h fig s12 the disinfection performance of ep cl2 maintained above 6 log bacterial inactivation within 60 h for treating tap water 1 5 v and 0 9 mg l cl2 and lake water 1 2 v and 1 2 mg l cl2 the concentrations of cobalt particles and ions in effluent were measured by icp oes with detectable limitation 0 1 μg l it was revealed that only during the initial 10 min operation around 15 μg l co3o4 particles were detected in the effluent due to the insufficient washing during electrode fabrication the stable b cereus inactivation and undetectable co species in effluent suggested the excellent stability of the nanowire electrodes chlorination is a widespread application method to control the microbiological risk for drinking water systems but the chlorine resistant bacteria and disinfection by products greatly threatens the water safety and public health in this work nanowire assisted electroporation was combined with chlorination to construct the synergistic ep cl2 disinfection via inducing cell pores for promoting the chlorine permeation and the subsequent bacterial inactivation the synergistic effects of ep cl2 were recognized for inactivation of g and chlorine resistant sensitive bacteria the synergistic ep cl2 achieved undetectable live bacteria at much lower chlorine dosages as compared with the individual chlorination potentially reducing the formation of chlorinated disinfection byproducts the excellent operation performance of ep cl2 for bacterial inactivation in di water tap water and lake water also suggested its sound application potentials in complex water matrix in addition the ep cl2 disinfection was operated with a flow through mode which can be further developed to install in pipe networks for alleviating the microorganism regrowth during long time and long distance water distribution 4 conclusion in this work synergistic nanowire assisted electroporation ep and chlorination cl2 was constructed attempting to induce cell pores for promoting the chlorine permeation and the bacterial inactivation the synergistic ep cl2 exhibited much higher inactivation for a broad spectrum of bacteria including chlorine resistant sensitive bacteria and gram positive negative bacteria than the individual ep and cl2 disinfection based on the analyses of cell membrane integrity intracellular free chlorine levels and cell morphology the synergistic disinfection mechanisms were revealed that the locally enhanced electric field of nanowires induced the formation of pores on cell wall membrane and the tightly bound eps layer thereby promoting chlorine permeation and oxidation damage of cell structures for bacterial inactivation the synergistic effects of ep cl2 were recognized for treating the chlorine resistant b cereus in tap water and lake water suggesting the sound application potentials of ep cl2 in complex water matrix declaration of competing interest

15199,the widespread use of chlorination cl2 in drinking water systems causes the selection of chlorine resistant bacteria commonly with dense extracellular polymeric substance eps against chlorine permeation posing significant threat to public health herein a nanowire assisted electroporation ep via locally enhanced electric field was combined with cl2 to construct the synergistic ep cl2 disinfection with the purposes of inducing cell pores for chlorine permeation and bacterial inactivation the synergistic effects of ep cl2 were observed for inactivation of chlorine resistant bacillus cereus g 304 μg doc eps 109 cfu and aeromonas media g 35 8 μg and chlorine sensitive escherichia coli g 5 1 μg that were frequent occurrence in drinking water systems the ep cl2 enabled above 6 log b cereus inactivation undetectable live bacteria at 1 5 v ep and 0 9 mg l cl2 which was much higher than the individual ep 1 11 log and cl2 1 13 log disinfection the cell membrane integrity intracellular free chlorine levels and morphology analyses revealed that the electroporation induced pores on cell wall membrane destructed the bound eps barrier for chlorine permeation and the pore sizes were further enlarged by chlorine oxidation hence facilitating bacterial inactivation via destroying the cell structures the excellent disinfection performance for tap water and lake water also suggested its sound application potentials graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords chlorine resistant bacteria electroporation chlorine permeation cell membrane integrity cell destruction data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction drinking water safety has become a global concern while the control of pathogenic microorganisms is one of the most essential issues in water quality and safety nixdorff et al 2021 wallmann et al 2021 chlorine disinfection hclo clo2 and nh2cl due to the strong sterilizing ability and low cost has been recognized as one of the most common disinfection techniques in addition it can maintain a certain level of residual chlorine for substantial inhibition of microbial regrowth over a long time and distance in distribution systems until the point of use how et al 2017 nihemaiti et al 2020 nevertheless a critical issue associated with chlorination is the widespread use of chlorine has promoted the selection of chlorine resistant bacteria hu et al 2021 li et al 2013 which can cause the microorganism regrowth and biofilm formation in pipe networks threatening the public health ding et al 2019 zhao et al 2020 therefore it is of great significance to explore measures for controlling the chlorine resistant bacteria in drinking water systems luo et al 2021a the bacterial inactivation mechanisms by chlorine disinfectants are related to the oxidative damage of cell membrane for cell permeabilization or the permeation into cells for oxidizing intracellular functional components enzyme or dna cho et al 2010 it was well studied that the chlorine resistant bacteria generally tended to secrete more extracellular polymeric substances eps bound on cell surface than the chlorine sensitive ones luo et al 2022 wang et al 2019 which serve as barriers against chlorine permeation or as reactive substances for chlorine consumption ekundayo et al 2021 therefore it is highly desirable to develop strategy that can promote chlorine permeation into cells thereby ensuring the sufficient exposure to chlorine for the inactivation efficiency of chlorine resistant bacteria alternative methods via combining chlorination with ultraviolet uv radiations such as uv cl2 li et al 2018 uv free chlorine liu et al 2019 and uv nh2cl wu et al 2022 were developed to enhance the disinfection performance which were mainly attributed to the generation of hydroxyl radicals and reactive chlorine species with much higher oxidation capacities than chlorine chemicals in addition to achieve a certain disinfection performance the combined disinfection methods can lower the required chlorine dosage in turn reducing the formation of chlorinated disinfection byproducts cerreta et al 2020 yan et al 2022 however with the main oxidation mechanisms the efficiencies of these combined methods for chlorine resistant bacteria inactivation were still limited by the oxidative competition of eps barrier with the physics of lightning rod effect on nanowires the electric field over their sharp tips can be enhanced by several orders of magnitude inspired by this phenomenon electroporation disinfection equipped by electrodes with nanowire arrays was developed to inactivate various gram positive negative g bacteria by the locally enhanced electric field under low voltage driving 3 v huo et al 2016 pi et al 2021 under exposure to electric field over 105 v m the lipid bilayer will be rearranged to form irreversible or reversible pores leading to bacterial inactivation via membrane damage or serious cytoplasm leakage yusupov et al 2017 zhou et al 2021 as a physical disinfection method the nanowire assisted electroporation has excellent operation stability in complex water matrix huo et al 2019a suggesting the insignificant effect of eps competitive oxidation on electroporation disinfection however the individual electroporation without sufficient reactive species generation limits its application for drinking water storage and distribution due to the lack of continuous disinfection ability besides the lethal electroporation pores for bacterial inactivation reversible electroporation pores with slight cytoplasm leakage also occurred under insufficient electric field exposure which can be resealed in several minutes due to the fluidity of lipid membrane without loss of the microbial activity it was revealed that the treatment of bacillus pumilus pillet et al 2016 saccharomyces cerevisiae stirke et al 2019 and chlamydomonas reinhardtii bensalem et al 2020 cells with strong electric fields also caused the unrecoverable pores on the rigid cell wall the electroporation induced pores on cell wall and membrane may destruct the dense eps layer bound on cell hence it can be deduced that via combining the electroporation and chlorination the reversible electroporation induced cell pores can provide chlorine permeation channels for facilitating chlorine resistant bacteria inactivation herein synergistic co3o4 nanowire assisted ep and cl2 ep cl2 was constructed to study the synergistic effects and mechanisms for bacterial inactivation with chlorine sensitive escherichia coli e coli g for comparison purposes bacillus cereus b cereus g and aeromonas media a media g were selected as the targeted chlorine resistant strains because of their high chlorine resistances and frequent occurrence in water treatment systems luo et al 2022 wang et al 2021 the synergistic effects of ep cl2 were investigated as functions of ep voltages and chlorine dosages and compared with the sequential ep and cl2 ep cl2 and the individual cl2 and ep methods the synergistic mechanisms were elaborated from the aspects of cell permeability morphology and intracellular chlorine levels the application potentials of synergistic ep cl2 were also investigated for the real water resources 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and chemicals all the chemicals used in this study were analytical reagents and purchased from mackin shanghai china including sodium hypochlorite naclo sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate dopamine hydrochloride tris hydroxymethyl aminoethane cobalt nitrate hexahydrate ammonium fluoride and carbamide graphite felts gf were purchased from liaoning jingu carbon material co ltd china as porous substrates for synthesis of nanowire modified electrodes all aqueous solutions were prepared with deionized di water resistance 18 2 mω cm 2 2 bacterial cultivation and enumeration the model chlorine resistant bacterial strains bacillus cereus b cereus g genbank number mw789846 and aeromonas media a media g mw790028 were screened from a water treatment plant in beijing luo et al 2022 and a chlorine sensitive bacterial strain escherichia coli e coli g cgmcc 1 3373 was used for comparison purposes which were frequent occurrence in drinking water systems ding et al 2019 luo et al 2021b the chlorine resistances of b cereus a media and e coli were identified via the chlorine disinfection experiments fig s1 and table s1 the b cereus and a media were cultured in luria bertani lb broth with shaking at 25 c and 180 rpm for 16 h until 2 108 cfu ml the e coli was cultured in nutrient broth nb at 37 c and 180 rpm for 16 h until 3 109 cfu ml the bacterial cells were collected by centrifugation at 10 000 rpm for 5 min and the remaining bacterial pellet was resuspended using sterile di water for two times to remove the residual broth for bacterial enumeration each sample was serially diluted with 0 9 sterile saline then 100 1000 μl samples were uniformly plated on lb or nb agar plates the agar plates were incubated overnight at 25 or 37 c to determine the concentration of culturable bacteria with detect limitation of 1 cfu ml 2 3 nanowire electrode fabrication and electroporation ep device construction the co3o4 nanowire arrays modified gf electrodes co3o4nws were fabricated via hydrothermal and calcination methods according to our previous work pi et al 2022 briefly six pieces of gf substrates with 5 mm in thickness and 25 mm in diameter were immersed in 60 ml solution of 70 mm co no3 2 350 mm co nh2 2 and 140 mm nh4f followed by heating in a 100 ml teflon lined stainless steel autoclave at 120 c for 10 h after fully cleaning with di water the materials were annealed at 400 c for 2 h in a muffle furnace to avoid the catalytic decomposition of naclo into cl and o2 species by co3o4 kim et al 2012 the co3o4nws electrodes were deposited by nano sized polydopamine coating according to our previous work huo et al 2019b briefly 6 pieces of co3o4nws electrodes were immersed in 150 ml solution with 10 mm dopamine hydrochloride and 10 mm tris ph of 8 5 for 4 or 8 h at 40 c fabricating co3o4nws 4 h and co3o4nws 8 h electrodes fig s2 the electroporation ep device with a flow through mode was constructed by assembling a conic water distributor a conic water collector a cathode chamber and an anode chamber fig s3 the electrode chambers had the same sizes as the nanowire electrodes for parallelly settling the electrodes which were separated by a piece of filter paper pore sizes 80 120 μm to avoid the short circuit titanium rods were used to connect the electrodes with an adjustable dc power supply in our preliminary experiments chlorine decomposition and b cereus inactivation by the ep devices with co3o4nws co3o4nws 4 h and co3o4nws 8 h electrodes were compared in fig s4 the chlorine decomposition by the electrodes was evaluated via pumping the chlorine solution 0 5 or 0 9 mg l without bacteria addition flow through the ep devices at 500 l m2 h without applying voltage and the chlorine decomposition was obtained by the differences of chlorine concentration in ep influent and effluent with pumping 0 9 mg l chlorine solution only 0 05 0 07 mg l chlorine were decomposed by the ep devices with co3o4nws 4 h and co3o4nws 8 h electrodes which were much lower than that with the raw co3o4nws electrode 0 63 mg l nevertheless the electric field can be only enhanced near the nanowire tips and the polydopamine coating with low conductivity can act as an obstacle for the locally enhanced electric field hence as compared with the ep with co3o4nws electrode the decrease in b cereus inactivation was observed for co3o4nws 4 h 0 06 0 08 log decrease and co3o4nws 8 h 0 2 0 3 log decrease electrodes considering the chlorine consumption and disinfection performance the co3o4nws 4 h electrode was elected as nanowire electrode for ep disinfection 2 4 disinfection procedure by the combination process of ep and cl2 for the individual ep disinfection 106 cfu ml bacteria in di water was continuously pumped into the ep device at flux of 500 l m2 h by a peristaltic pump and the effluent was collected to measure the culturable bacterial concentrations for the individual chlorination cl2 25 ml naclo solution was added into 25 ml bacterial suspension with final concentrations of 0 2 1 2 mg l in 100 ml conical flask after shaking at 180 rpm for 30 min in darkness the residual chlorine concentration was measured with n n diethyl p phenylenediamine method and the residual chlorine was quenched with sodium thiosulfate to measure the culturable bacterial concentrations according to combination modes of ep and cl2 the sequential ep and cl2 ep cl2 and synergistic ep and cl2 ep cl2 processes were constructed fig 1 for the ep cl2 25 ml effluent of ep device was collected followed by the cl2 disinfection for the ep cl2 the bacterial suspension and naclo solution were mixed evenly through the y shaped tube and pumped into the ep device the ep effluent was collected and shaken at 180 rpm for 30 min in darkness followed by measuring the residual chlorine and culturable bacterial concentrations the bacterial inactivation by the ep lo g ep cl2 lo g c l 2 ep cl2 lo g ep c l 2 and ep cl2 lo g ep c l 2 and the synergistic effects of the ep cl2 and ep cl2 were calculated as the logarithmic reduction using the following equations 1 log inactivation log n 0 n f 2 synergistic effect lo g ep c l 2 or lo g ep c l 2 lo g c l 2 lo g ep where the n0 and nf were the culturable bacterial concentrations before and after disinfection for the typical disinfection processes in fig s5 the ep and ep cl2 exhibited slight decrease in bacterial inactivation due to the interception of cells in porous electrodes within 10 min and maintained the operation stability in the next 50 min suggesting that the over 10 min operation time was required for sampling the ep and ep cl2 effluent solutions all experiments were conducted in triplicate and the data were expressed as the mean values with error bars 2 5 flow cytometry analyses for cell integrity and intracellular free chlorine levels the bacterial cell membrane integrities before and after disinfection were analyzed with a flow cytometry beckman gallios using fluorescent staining dyes film tracer sigma of syto 9 and propidium iodide pi bacterial suspensions 106 cfu ml were stained with syto 9 5 µm and pi 45 µm for 30 min in darkness to detect the intracellular free chlorine levels bacterial suspensions were washed by centrifugation and resuspension with pbs solution to remove the residual chlorine then 1 ml solution was stained with 10 mm 2 7 dichlorofluorescein diacetate dcfh da solarbio at 37 c for 20 min followed by washing with pbs twice to remove the excess dcfh da about 10 000 cells were counted for each analysis 2 6 sem analyses of cell morphology the bacterial morphologies before and after disinfection were characterized with a scanning electron microscopy fe sem hitachi s 8010 the bacterial cells were collected by centrifugation and then fixed in 2 5 glutaraldehyde solution at 4 c for overnight the fixed cells were washed with pbs for three times and then sequentially dehydrated by 30 50 70 80 90 and 100 ethanol with each step for 10 min immersion after replacing the solution with tert butanol the samples were freeze dried and sprayed by gold sputter before sem analysis 2 7 operation performance of ep cl2 for real water resources the disinfection performance of ep cl2 was investigated by using tap water and lake water within continuous operation time of 60 h the lake water was pretreated by filtration with 0 22 μm membrane to remove the indigenous bacteria and the basic water qualities of di water tap water and lake water were listed in table s2 the chlorine resistant bacteria polluted water samples were prepared by diluting the b cereus suspension with the tap water or lake water to a final concentration of 106 cfu ml the concentrations of cobalt particles and ions in ep cl2 effluent were measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes to evaluate the electrode stability the detached and dissolved co3o4 nanowires were distinguished with or without acidizing the effluent solution 10 mm h2so4 3 results and discussion 3 1 disinfection performance by the combination processes of ep and cl2 as shown in fig 2 for the cl2 disinfection the log inactivation of chlorine resistant b cereus and a media was much lower than the chlorine sensitive e coli for instance under 0 5 mg l chlorine only 0 58 log b cereus inactivation and 1 24 log a media inactivation were achieved whereas 4 68 log e coli inactivation was obtained the ct90 values by 0 5 mg l cl2 disinfection were 7 98 b cereus 3 95 a media and 0 38 mg l min e coli text s1 and table s1 as compared with e coli cells 5 1 μg doc 109 cfu a dense and tightly bound eps layer on b cereus 304 μg doc 109 cfu and a media 35 8 μg doc 109 cfu cells were observed text s2 resulting in their distinct chlorine resistance luo et al 2022 for the 1 0 v ep disinfection the b cereus a media and e coli exhibited similar inactivation 1 log resulting from the physical disinfection mechanisms via locally enhanced electric field as shown in fig 2a and b the synergistic effects of ep cl2 0 2 2 1 log and ep cl2 0 5 3 0 log for b cereus inactivation were apparently observed especially achieving above 6 log inactivation undetectable live cells with limit of detection 1 cfu ml by ep cl2 at 1 0 v ep and 1 2 mg l cl2 for ep disinfection only ep induced lethal pores on cell membrane contributed to bacterial inactivation while some reversible pores can be resealed gradually within several minutes after ep treatment without loss of cell viability kotnik et al 2015 the strong electric field can also induce irrecoverable destruction of cell walls pillet et al 2016 which may damage the tightly bound eps layer more evidence can be found in the following sections hence for ep cl2 and ep cl2 the live cells with reversible electroporation were subjected to the destruction of cell wall and the bound eps layer which can facilitate chlorine permeation to achieve the synergistic effects for b cereus inactivation the chlorine decay in fig s6 also revealed that the ep cl2 0 67 mg l and ep cl2 0 77 mg l exhibited much more chlorine consumption than the cl2 disinfection 0 42 mg l the ep cl2 exhibited 0 3 0 9 log lower b cereus inactivation than ep cl2 which can be attributed to that the reversible membrane pores were resealed during collecting the ep effluent for subsequent cl2 disinfection with increasing the chlorine dosages the synergistic effects of ep cl2 for b cereus inactivation exhibited an increase then decrease trend with the maximum value of 3 0 log at 1 0 v ep and 0 9 mg l cl2 which can be ascribed to the limited reversible pores by the constant electroporation strength at 1 0 v the synergistic effects of ep cl2 were also observed for inactivating a media g fig 2c e coli g fig 2d as well as for b cereus g suspensions with concentrations of 105 and 5 106 cfu ml fig s7 the synergistic effects of ep cl2 for the bacterial inactivation followed an order of b cereus 0 5 3 0 log a media 0 3 2 5 log e coli 0 2 1 2 log which was in agreement with the orders of their eps contents and chlorine resistances and also supported the eps layer on the cells as chlorine permeation barrier in addition with coupling the 1 0 v ep with 0 5 mg l cl2 disinfection the ct90 values decreased from 7 98 to 0 47 for b cereus from 3 95 to 0 41 for a media and from 0 38 to 0 11 mg l min e coli which suggested that electroporation promoted the chlorine permeation for bacterial inactivation fig s8 and table s1 the synergistic effects of ep cl2 for inactivating these g and chlorine resistant sensitive bacteria suggested its sound potentials for controlling microbiological risks in water in the following study b cereus with significant chlorine resistance was selected for further investigating the synergistic disinfection mechanisms of ep cl2 3 2 effect of applied voltages on ep cl2 disinfection the disinfection performance of ep cl2 was further evaluated with 0 9 mg l cl2 and ep voltages from 0 2 to 1 5 v as shown in fig 3 a b cereus inactivation by ep increased gradually with increasing the applied voltages achieving 1 1 log inactivation at 1 5 v similar results were also reported that higher voltages promoted the formation of strong electric field near nanowire tips in turn enhancing the electroporation disinfection performance huo et al 2016 with increasing the ep voltages the ep cl2 exhibited significantly increase in the b cereus inactivation and the synergistic effects which achieved above 6 log b cereus inactivation with synergistic effect of 3 7 log at 1 5 v ep and 0 9 mg l cl2 this phenomenon can be attributed to that the higher voltages also induced more non lethal cells with reversible electroporation wang et al 2022 thereby enhancing the synergistic effects of ep cl2 to overcome the eps barrier for chlorine permeation into the cells after cl2 ep and ep cl2 disinfection the water samples were stored for 24 h to evaluate the cell viability as shown in fig 3b after ep cl2 disinfection at 1 5 v ep and 0 9 mg l cl2 with above 6 log inactivation no regrowth and reactivation of b cereus cells occurred during storage also the survival cells after disinfection gradually died during storage with more obvious cell death than the untreated sample the b cereus concentration of untreated sample decreased from 106 to 2 105 cfu ml with 20 viability fig s9 whereas below 5 viabilities were found for the samples after cl2 from 75000 to 2900 cfu ml ep from 90000 to 810 cfu ml and ep cl2 from 11 to 0 cfu ml disinfection these results indicated that some live b cereus cells were impaired after disinfection causing their inactivation during storage 3 3 cell membrane integrity and intracellular free chlorine levels a cell permeable fluorescent stain syto 9 labeling cells with intact or impaired membranes and a cell impermeable stain pi only labeling cells with impaired membranes were used to investigate the cell membrane integrity in this work 45 µm pi with higher dna binding affinity was used to quench syto 9 signal 5 µm for distinguishing the slightly impaired cells or seriously damaged cells mao et al 2021 sun et al 2019 as shown in fig 4 fluorescence dot plots were divided into four quadrants intact cells only stained by syto 9 in q 1 slightly impaired cells stained by syto 9 and pi in q 2 seriously damaged cells only stained by pi in q 3 and unstained cell debris in q 4 lv et al 2017 for untreated b cereus suspensions 96 8 cells were located in q 1 with 1 9 cells in q 2 suggesting almost cells with intact membranes fig 4a1 via staining the ep effluents from 0 5 1 0 v the proportion of cells in q 2 increased to 42 5 57 0 fig 4a1 a4 which was in agreement with the results in fig 3a that the higher voltages promoted cell inactivation via irreversible electroporation to recognize the reversible electroporation the ep influent was also stained with syto 9 and pi followed by ep disinfection hence the pi can permeate into the cells via the reversible membrane pores pore sizes larger than pi molecules before pore resealing and the reversible pores can be evaluated by the differences in pi signals via staining the ep influents and effluents for the ep disinfection at 0 v 96 5 cells were located in the q 1 fig 4b1 indicating the limited cell damage by the sharp structure of nanowires as compared with the stained ep effluents 42 5 57 0 cells in q 2 fig 4a2 a4 26 3 36 9 higher cell proportions in q 2 were observed for the stained ep influents 68 8 93 9 fig 4b2 b4 these results reflected that a large part of live cells after ep disinfection were suffered from reversible electroporation and the free chlorine with smaller size than pi molecule can also permeate into the cells via these reversible pores thereby promoting the b cereus inactivation zhao et al 2022 as shown in fig 4c1 after 0 9 mg l cl2 disinfection 62 6 cells had intact cell membranes with 90 inactivation 1 log inactivation resulting from that free chlorine mainly attacked intracellular functional components for bacterial inactivation without causing significant cell damage cho et al 2010 for the ep cl2 disinfection fig 4c2 c4 the fluorescent signals shifted significantly to q 2 and q 3 indicating that the synergistic effects of ep cl2 caused more serious membrane damage for instance the ep cl2 at 0 5 v ep and 0 9 mg l cl2 98 6 exhibited 19 0 more cells in q 2 than the cells summation in q 2 after the individual ep 42 5 and cl2 37 1 disinfection these results were also in agreement with the analyses of intracellular free chlorine levels fig s10 as compared with the 0 9 mg l cl2 disinfection 27 4 the 0 5 1 5v ep cl2 exhibited much more positive cells with intracellular free chlorine 41 1 79 3 based on the above analyses the electroporation induced pores on cell wall membrane destructed the bound eps for enhancing chlorine permeation into the cells and the subsequent chlorine oxidation promoted the damage of electroporation induced pores for bacterial inactivation 3 4 synergistic disinfection mechanisms of ep cl2 for cell structure damage the sem images of b cereus cells before and after ep cl2 and ep cl2 disinfection are shown in fig 5 after individual ep disinfection small irreversible pores were presented on the cells which provided strong evidence that the locally enhanced electric field of nanowires damaged the cell wall membrane and the tightly bound eps layer after individual 0 9 mg l cl2 disinfection insignificant cell damages were observed with the slight loss of some threadlike and loosely bound eps due to the chlorine oxidation for the synergistic ep cl2 disinfection the b cereus cell structures were significantly disrupted with much larger pores on the cells than that after individual ep treatment and the higher ep voltages promoted the cell destruction due to the enhanced electric field near nanowire tips these results further supported that the electroporation induced pores provided channels for chlorine permeation into the cells and the electroporation induced pore sizes were enlarged by the chlorine oxidation based on the analyses about the cell membrane integrity intracellular free chlorine levels and cell morphology the synergistic mechanisms of ep cl2 for inactivation of chlorine resistant bacteria were illustrated in fig 6 with g bacterium as example for the individual cl2 disinfection the dense eps layer on cell prevented chlorine permeation into the cells significantly limiting the bacterial inactivation for individual ep disinfection some chlorine resistant bacteria exposed to the strong electric field near nanowire tips were inactivated by the lethal irreversible reversible electroporation with serious cytoplasm leakage which was accompanied by some survival cells with the non lethal reversible pores the strong electric field also induced the destruction of the cell walls and the bound eps layer therefore for the synergistic ep cl2 disinfection non lethal reversible pores provided chlorine permeation channels to overcome the eps barrier and the chlorine oxidation further enlarged the electroporation induced pores hence enhancing the bacterial inactivation via destroying the cell structures 3 5 application potentials of ep cl2 disinfection the disinfection performance of ep cl2 was evaluated by using the real water resources tap water and lake water fig 7 the individual 0 9 mg l cl2 disinfection achieved 1 1 log b cereus inactivation for the di water and tap water whereas much lower b cereus inactivation 0 67 log was obtained for the lake water due to the competitive oxidation of organic matters for chlorine consumption fig s11 zhao et al 2006 for the individual ep disinfection insignificant differences in b cereus inactivation were observed for the di water tap water and lake water resulting from the physical disinfection mechanisms of electroporation huo et al 2019a the synergistic effects of ep cl2 were also achieved and increased obviously with the applied voltages for b cereus inactivation in the tap water and lake water fig 7 with 0 9 mg l cl2 the ep cl2 exhibited similar b cereus inactivation for the di water and tap water with above 6 log inactivation at 1 5 v ep and 0 9 mg l cl2 which was higher than the b cereus inactivation in lake water 4 6 log due to its high pollutant contents for chlorine consumption further increasing chlorine dosage to 1 2 mg l the disinfection performance of ep cl2 for lake water significantly increased with achieving undetectable live b cereus at 1 2 v ep cl2 in addition the ep cl2 for tap water and lake water disinfection showed much lower energy consumption than the individual ep and cl2 disinfection text s3 and table s3 for example as compared with the individual ep 5 80 j l log and cl2 5 01 j l log for lake water disinfection the ep cl2 1 2 v and 1 2 mg l cl2 had much lower energy consumption 3 74 j l log the ep cl2 also exhibited excellent operation stability for treating the tap water and lake water within continuous operation time of 60 h fig s12 the disinfection performance of ep cl2 maintained above 6 log bacterial inactivation within 60 h for treating tap water 1 5 v and 0 9 mg l cl2 and lake water 1 2 v and 1 2 mg l cl2 the concentrations of cobalt particles and ions in effluent were measured by icp oes with detectable limitation 0 1 μg l it was revealed that only during the initial 10 min operation around 15 μg l co3o4 particles were detected in the effluent due to the insufficient washing during electrode fabrication the stable b cereus inactivation and undetectable co species in effluent suggested the excellent stability of the nanowire electrodes chlorination is a widespread application method to control the microbiological risk for drinking water systems but the chlorine resistant bacteria and disinfection by products greatly threatens the water safety and public health in this work nanowire assisted electroporation was combined with chlorination to construct the synergistic ep cl2 disinfection via inducing cell pores for promoting the chlorine permeation and the subsequent bacterial inactivation the synergistic effects of ep cl2 were recognized for inactivation of g and chlorine resistant sensitive bacteria the synergistic ep cl2 achieved undetectable live bacteria at much lower chlorine dosages as compared with the individual chlorination potentially reducing the formation of chlorinated disinfection byproducts the excellent operation performance of ep cl2 for bacterial inactivation in di water tap water and lake water also suggested its sound application potentials in complex water matrix in addition the ep cl2 disinfection was operated with a flow through mode which can be further developed to install in pipe networks for alleviating the microorganism regrowth during long time and long distance water distribution 4 conclusion in this work synergistic nanowire assisted electroporation ep and chlorination cl2 was constructed attempting to induce cell pores for promoting the chlorine permeation and the bacterial inactivation the synergistic ep cl2 exhibited much higher inactivation for a broad spectrum of bacteria including chlorine resistant sensitive bacteria and gram positive negative bacteria than the individual ep and cl2 disinfection based on the analyses of cell membrane integrity intracellular free chlorine levels and cell morphology the synergistic disinfection mechanisms were revealed that the locally enhanced electric field of nanowires induced the formation of pores on cell wall membrane and the tightly bound eps layer thereby promoting chlorine permeation and oxidation damage of cell structures for bacterial inactivation the synergistic effects of ep cl2 were recognized for treating the chlorine resistant b cereus in tap water and lake water suggesting the sound application potentials of ep cl2 in complex water matrix declaration of competing interest
