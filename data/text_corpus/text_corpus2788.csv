municipal wastewater is now considered as a resource for making treatment plants as energy self sufficient as organics within the wastewater have a potential to produce bio gas if digested anaerobically 1 wastewater production has increased with an increase in population which is also putting a stress on our existing water sources with an estimated 330 km3 year of municipal wastewater being generated worldwide it also has a potential to meet the energy demand of millions of households via biogas production anaerobically 2 in context to pakistan only 0 548 km3 year of municipal wastewater is being treated against the generated volume of 6 849 km3 annually 3 recently pakistan council of research in water resources pcrwr has reported that less than 10 of urban wastewater is being treated in pakistan 4 thus a huge potential exists to recover energy from domestic organics and to make energy self sufficient wastewater treatment plants activated sludge as system is commonly used and considered as a robust and efficient for treating municipal wastewater however this system lacks the potential to recover valuable resources from wastewater 5 therefore a typical conventional activated sludge cas process requires a minimum energy input of 0 30 to 0 65 kw h m3 6 or entailing a very high net annual energy input of 40 kw h per population equivalent pe 7 the caloric energy content of raw domestic sewage is almost nine times more than the required electricity demand to operate cas plant 8 as municipal wastewater is characterized by a low temperature low organic strength and a high fractions of suspended and colloidal organic matter om 9 and opting for direct anaerobic sewage treatment process makes it unfeasible 10 therefore an appropriate up concentration step can be implemented for maximum energy production directly from the sewage organics 11 the idea of sewage up concentration is being accepted gradually as a promising and sustainable way for recovering resources from wastewater 10 several up concentration technologies have been reported in literature such as high rate conventional activated sludge process hicas different membrane based technologies like enhanced membrane coagulation reactor e mcr 11 membrane based pre concentration mpc 12 direct membrane filtration dmf 13 hybrid coagulation microfiltration with air backflushing to direct sewage concentration 14 chemically enhanced primary sedimentation cept has been anticipated and reported as an energy neutral wastewater treatment option followed by anaerobic digestion of the produced sludge 15 16 with an optimal concentration of aluminum al3 as a coagulant it removed 85 of particulate cod 17 however it was not able to remove dissolved organic matter effectively and limited recovery of energy was observed in subsequent stages 8 high load contact stabilization system hics was operated at high sludge specific loading rates 2 kg bcod kg 1 tss d 1 and low srt 1 2 d the system recovered 36 of influent chemical energy as methane via ad with less amount of co2 production and more sludge production in comparison with the hi cas process 8 coagulation in the up concentration process is considered as inefficient in terms of organic matter removal and thus demanding an addition of subsequent treatment options 11 to overcome this issue coagulants and adsorbents have been used like poly aluminum chloride pacl and powder activated carbon pac in an enhanced membrane coagulant reactor e mcr capable of achieving highly concentrated sludge with a cod ranging between 6000 9800 mg l 11 the removal of organics and nitrogen from sewage through membrane based pre concentration mpc could achieve a total of 0 38 kw h m3 energy recovery by coupling it with anaerobic digester 12 leal et al 18 reported that it is feasible to concentrate greywater up to 10 times against its original cod value with a high loaded membrane bioreactor hl mbr during bio flocculation microorganisms partly consume soluble biodegradable pollutants and excrete polymers that induce flocculation among colloidal and suspended particles of wastewater 19 when operated at relatively shorter srt and in combination with a very short hrt typically below 1 h high concentrations of om can be achieved 20 energy requirements in membrane based technologies and co2 emissions greenhouse gas are mainly due to aeration and making aerobic technologies impractical under the circumstances of global noticeable fossil fuel energy crisis and drastic climate change implications 21 apart from high energy requisition aerobic process yields relatively more sludge and consequently demands extensive handling treatment and disposal processes 1 22 while anaerobic treatment of sewage has demonstrated a mature and practical way of achieving net energy production and also capable of meeting the stringent effluent standards 23 24 in this study anaerobic system was designed to up concentrate effluent stream with the potential of producing maximum biogas at an infinite srt the novelty of the process is an up concentration of a wastewater stream in terms of cod and tp through bsp instead of sludge as reported in previous studies in comparison with conventional bsp this system was operated at relatively shorter hrt and with infinite srt shorter hrt supported in an increased biosorption process and an infinite srt assisted in minimizing issues associated with sludge handling treatment and disposal shorter hrt yielded in the adsorption of om on the surface of anaerobic micro organisms resulting in an enriched cod effluent settled sludge in an anaerobic sedimentation tank was used as an adsorbent for up concentrating cod tp and minimizing the ammonium concentration in the concentrated stream finally the optimized runs were obtained using box behnken design bbd under response surface methodology rsm keeping in view the required c n p ratio for biogas production in anaerobic digesters 2 materials and methods 2 1 system design system for up concentration of wastewater through biosorption sedimentation process consisted of a feed tank mixing tank of 2 l capacity and sedimentation tank of 8 l capacity as shown in fig 1 peristaltic pump bt 300 2 j longer china was used as a feed pump to control the flow rate of synthetic wastewater into the mixing tank and another peristaltic pump bt 300 2 j longer china was used for sludge recirculation for maintaining mixed liquor suspended solids mlss in a range of 0 8 1 2 g l in the mixing tank a propeller was used for the mixing of feed and recirculated sludge at a fixed frequency rate of 400 rpm so that organic matter could adsorb on the surface of microbes within the mixing tank two digital display time relays dh48s s omron japan were also used to ensure the proper working of the system propeller was connected with a timer so that mixing can be done at specific intervals another timer was connected with a sludge pump to recirculate anaerobic sludge ensuring the required mlss concentration in the mixing tank 2 2 system startup initially the system was operated in batch mode for 15 days to optimize the recirculation flow rate of sludge to maintain the required mlss concentration within the mixing tank a spike of potassium nitrate kno3 of 10 mg l was added in the mixing tank where the anoxic condition was maintained to ensure the presence of nitrate no3 1 n as electron acceptor so that complete nitrification phosphorus uptake can be accomplished for startup an acclimatized anaerobic sludge was taken from the water and wastewater laboratory at the institute of environmental sciences engineering iese nust and fed to sedimentation tank nitrogen purging was done for 10 min in order to ensure an anaerobic condition within the sedimentation tank and for a few minutes within the mixing tank for maintaining anoxic environment dissolved oxygen do less than 1 0 mg l 2 3 synthetic wastewater characteristics with the cod of 500 mg l synthetic wastewater was used in this study with the recipe reported in table 1 the average concentrations of cod nh4 n tkn and tp in the synthetic wastewater over the experimental period were found as 500 15 76 8 85 10 and 6 1 5 mg l respectively 2 4 experimental approach synthetic wastewater was introduced into the mixing tank through feed pump at constant flow rate and an acclimatized anaerobic sludge with mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss of 11 g l was introduced into the mixing tank via a peristaltic pump during continuous phase of the study the starving condition was maintained during day time in the anaerobic sedimentation tank by operating the system at very short hrts i e 60 120 min which results in the adsorption of om on the surface of anaerobic microbes while feast condition for microbes was occurred when the system was switched to operate at relatively higher hrt up to 300 min during night time such feast famine condition not only provided enough time for microbes to reproduce during night time but also to adsorb om during day time meerburg et al 8 reported that the feast famine condition induces selective pressure on microorganisms to adsorb organics by varying hrt of the system in this study the excreted polymers acted as a biding material assisted in the adsorption of organic molecules on the surface of microbes and facilitated in the agglomeration of organic molecules however due to shorter hrts the microbes did not get sufficient time to settle completely in the sedimentation tank and re suspension of microbes occurred 19 which ultimately became a part of effluent stream the system was operated under different phases in order to find optimal hrt of anoxic tank and anaerobic tank for maximum biosorption of organic matter total phosphorus but less concentration of ammonium nitrogen in the effluent the three operational phases of the system are presented in table 2 additional runs were also performed at various anoxic and anaerobic hrt combinations as predicted by box behnken design bbd reported in table s1 2 5 operating procedure of the system the temperature within the reactors was found to be in the range of 28 32 c as per ambient temperature anoxic condition was maintained in the mixing tank while anaerobic condition was provided in the sedimentation tank and operated at different tano tan combinations as presented in table 2 sludge volume within the sedimentation tank varied with tan and optimal recirculated ratios were found as per requirement of mlss in the mixing tank in each phase 2 6 analytical methods chemical oxygen demand cod total nitrogen tn ammonium nitrogen total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn mixed liquor suspended solids mlss mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss were analyzed in accordance with standard methods 25 2 7 optimization of the process by using response surface methodology rsm rsm is a statistical tool used to analyze optimize and evaluate the process parameters it defines the effect of independent factors alone or in combination and also generates a mathematical model describing the processes interaction 26 27 process optimization was performed against independent variables anoxic and anaerobic hrts by using box behnken design bbd and found a relationship between variables and desired responses cod tp ammonium nitrogen and tkn 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of anoxic hrt on concentration factor of cod up concentration of cod was observed to increase sharply with an increase in anoxic hrt up to 60 min and then decreased at 90 min at constant anaerobic hrt of 60 min the same trends were observed at 90 and 120 min of anaerobic hrts as shown in fig 2 up to 8 times up concentration of cod in an effluent stream was observed at tano tan of 60 min 60 min physical processes like adsorption and bio flocculation can be achieved at shorter hrts 18 increased concentration of cod in effluent was due to the presence of more active microorganisms at shorter anoxic hrt and a relatively greater vss tss ratio at lower anaerobic hrt which resulted in an enhanced bio sorption process and consequently higher effluent cod extracellular polymeric substances eps may have acted as a binding material for biosorption of organic matter facilitated in flocs formation due to aggregation of bacterial cells and floc structure stabilization as well 28 29 3 2 total phosphorous in effluent against anaerobic hrts with an increase in anoxic hrts from 30 min to 90 min concentration factor of tp decreased from 1 96 to 1 84 as shown in fig 3 by keeping anaerobic hrt of 60 min as constant a similar trend was also exhibited by anaerobic hrts of 90 and 120 min a minimal decrease in phosphorous concentration occurs due to an increase in anoxic hrt 30 as anoxic hrt increased the potential for anoxic phosphorous uptake in the form of poly phosphate also increased by phosphorous accumulating organisms paos 31 which are considered as less efficient than aerobic phosphorous uptake organisms 32 the results also show that anaerobic hrt was directly linked with phosphates released within anaerobic reactor of the system a significant decrease in phosphate concentration was also observed with an increasing anaerobic hrt during the study 3 3 ammonium nitrogen removal at varying hrts nitrification is a two step process in which ammonium nitrogen is converted into nitrites followed by nitrates in the presence of oxygen which acts as an electron acceptor in this study nitrification and denitrification were achieved under anoxic condition mixing tank of the system as soluble cod acts as an electron acceptor instead of oxygen 33 34 removal efficiency of ammonium nitrogen declined significantly by changing anoxic hrt from 30 90 min at constant anaerobic hrt as shown in fig 4 maximum removal efficiency of 93 was achieved at tano tan of 30 min 90 min as organic carbon in settling tank act as electron donors and reduce no3 into n2 35 removal of ammonium nitrogen under anoxic anaerobic condition occurred may be due to nitrites production by the process termed as nitritation in the mixing tank 36 and anaerobic ammonium oxidation anamox process in the sedimentation tank nitrites have been reported as an electron acceptor instead of oxygen for the oxidation of ammonium nitrogen 37 furthermore a higher f m ratio shorter anoxic hrt led to enhanced biomass yield and activity which resulted in an improved removal efficiency of nitrogen 38 3 4 tkn removal at various anaerobic hrts tkn removal decreased significantly with an increase in anoxic hrt from 30 min to 90 min at each anaerobic hrt of 60 90 and 120 min as illustrated in fig 5 removal efficiency of nitrogen tends to decrease with an increase in anoxic hrts 39 which were also observed in this study shorter hrt resulted in an enhanced biological capacity activity of denitrifying bacteria and more food to micro organisms f m ratio 38 while infinite srt has also been correlated with a greater microbial diversity due to a low selective pressure on the present microbial community thereby slower growing nitrifying and denitrifying organisms grew and made nitrogen removal possible 40 more volatile suspended solids vss concentration was also found at shorter anaerobic hrt removal efficiency of tkn was found to decrease with an increase in anaerobic hrt and decreased tano tan ratio this might be due to shorter time provided for denitrifying micro organisms to consume substrate and to perform denitrification process ultimately ending up in lower nitrogen removal 41 3 5 mlvss to mlss ratio of recycled sludge mlvss concentration increased with an increase in tano tan ratio particularly at anaerobic hrt of 90 and 120 min while at anaerobic hrt of 60 min mlvss concentration was found to increase initially and then slightly decrease with an increase in anoxic hrt maximum mlvss mlss ratio was found at 60 min 60 min ratio tano tan as shown in fig 6 this might be due to lower f m ratio at higher hrt resulting in more time for microbes to consume organic matter and ultimately entering in their death endogenous phase 42 3 6 selection of optimized operational conditions 3 6 1 carbon to nitrogen to phosphorous ratio c n p carbon to nitrogen c n and nitrogen to phosphorous n p ratios not only reflect the nutrients levels of anaerobic digesters but c n ratio is more sensitive towards the digestion process 43 optimized runs were selected on the basis of c n p ratio and ammonium nitrogen removal initially anoxic to anaerobic hrts tano tan of 45 min 60 min and 60 min 60 min were considered as optimized runs with c n ratio of 104 and 117 respectively maximum cod removal from anaerobic digester has been reported at c n ratio of 250 while biogas production ceased at c n ratio of 750 44 moreover c p ratio was calculated as 261 for a run with tano tan of 45 min 60 min and the ratio increased to 352 for a run with tano tan of 60 min 60 min britz et al 45 reported that up to 15 times decrease in phosphorous concentration was observed against cod and it did not significantly affect the rate of biogas production as c p ratio of both the selected runs did not significantly affect the biogas production potential thereby tano tan of 60 min 60 min was chosen as an optimized run as its c n ratio was relatively more suitable for anaerobic digestion as compared to the other run cod n p ratio has been calculated against each run for selecting the optimized run with a maximum potential to produce biogas at different anoxic and anaerobic hrts are presented in table 3 3 6 2 maximum potential energy within up concentrated effluent the energy requirement in the conventional activated sludge process lies in the range of 0 3 0 6 kw h m3 of treated sewage 46 47 theoretically potential energy of 15 kw h m3 has been calculated previously for an effluent stream when the system operated at tano tan of 60 min 60 min 5 in this study runs with tano tan of 45 min 60 min and 60 min 60 min were selected as optimized runs with reference to maximum potential energy stored as cod in the effluent stream details of potential energy stored against an up concentrated effluent stream coming out of the system at various hrts have been presented in table 4 3 6 3 optimized run predicted by rsm optimized runs were further predicted by rsm investigating cod tp ammonium nitrogen and tkn as responses against the two factors anoxic and anaerobic hrts and on the basis of their possible interaction and importance bbd has suggested two optimum solutions and presented in table 5 3 6 4 rsm response to cod tp nh4 n and tkn analysis of variance anova a statistical tool was used for analyzing the results and to get regression equations which fitted the predicted and actual data regression co efficient r2 value close to one not only indicates the existence of a strong relationship between the variables but also authenticates the validity of the actual data following regression equations present the dependency of the parameters cod tp nh4 n and tkn against two factors i e a anaerobic hrt b anoxic hrt and equations with r2 values are given below cod 1216 49 1076 13 a 106 11 b 686 95 a b 981 51 a2 480 67 b2 r2 0 86 tp 9 95 1 69 a 0 38 b 0 033 a b 0 24 a2

e tano tan of 56 min 60 min was suggested by rsm and a run with tano tan of 60 min 60 min was repeated in order to cross verify the predicted results with the actual experimental results table 6 presents the actual and predicted values of the optimized run with a maximum biogas potential of 15 5 kw h m3 theoretically calculated and for details refer table 3 and the value of c n p ratio was well within the desired range for anaerobic digestion 4 conclusions different anoxic and anaerobic hydraulic retention time hrts were evaluated to up concentrate the wastewater via biosorption sedimentation process bsp the continuous lab scale sewage up concentration experiments exhibited the clear advantage of tano tan of 60 min 60 min by considering both up concentration in terms of cod and tp and ammonium nitrogen nh4 n removal while box behnken design under rsm predicted 56 min 60 min as an optimized run and also verified the selected run the theoretical maximum potential energy from the concentrated effluent was calculated as 15 5 kw h m3 to implement the proposed technology on a full scale it is important to couple it with anaerobic polishing step in order to meet the required stringent effluent standards therefore introducing bsp in future treatment plants will not only assist in making them a net energy positive treatment plants with an enhanced biogas production

anoxic hrt up to 60 min and then decreased at 90 min at constant anaerobic hrt of 60 min the same trends were observed at 90 and 120 min of anaerobic hrts as shown in fig 2 up to 8 times up concentration of cod in an effluent stream was observed at tano tan of 60 min 60 min physical processes like adsorption and bio flocculation can be achieved at shorter hrts 18 increased concentration of cod in effluent was due to the presence of more active microorganisms at shorter anoxic hrt and a relatively greater vss tss ratio at lower anaerobic hrt which resulted in an enhanced bio sorption process and consequently higher effluent cod extracellular polymeric substances eps may have acted as a binding material for biosorption of organic matter facilitated in flocs formation due to aggregation of bacterial cells and floc structure stabilization as well 28 29 3 2 total phosphorous in effluent against anaerobic hrts with an increase in anoxic hrts from 30 min to 90 min concentration factor of tp decreased from 1 96 to 1 84 as shown in fig 3 by keeping anaerobic hrt of 60 min as constant a similar trend was also exhibited by anaerobic hrts of 90 and 120 min a minimal decrease in phosphorous concentration occurs due to an increase in anoxic hrt 30 as anoxic hrt increased the potential for anoxic phosphorous uptake in the form of poly phosphate also increased by phosphorous accumulating organisms paos 31 which are considered as less efficient than aerobic phosphorous uptake organisms 32 the results also show that anaerobic hrt was directly linked with phosphates released within anaerobic reactor of the system a significant decrease in phosphate concentration was also observed with an increasing anaerobic hrt during the study 3 3 ammonium nitrogen removal at varying hrts nitrification is a two step process in which ammonium nitrogen is converted into nitrites followed by nitrates in the presence of oxygen which acts as an electron acceptor in this study nitrification and denitrification were achieved under anoxic condition mixing tank of the system as soluble cod acts as an electron acceptor instead of oxygen 33 34 removal efficiency of ammonium nitrogen declined significantly by changing anoxic hrt from 30 90 min at constant anaerobic hrt as shown in fig 4 maximum removal efficiency of 93 was achieved at tano tan of 30 min 90 min as organic carbon in settling tank act as electron donors and reduce no3 into n2 35 removal of ammonium nitrogen under anoxic anaerobic condition occurred may be due to nitrites production by the process termed as nitritation in the mixing tank 36 and anaerobic ammonium oxidation anamox process in the sedimentation tank nitrites have been reported as an electron acceptor instead of oxygen for the oxidation of ammonium nitrogen 37 furthermore a higher f m ratio shorter anoxic hrt led to enhanced biomass yield and activity which resulted in an improved removal efficiency of nitrogen 38 3 4 tkn removal at various anaerobic hrts tkn removal decreased significantly with an increase in anoxic hrt from 30 min to 90 min at each anaerobic hrt of 60 90 and 120 min as illustrated in fig 5 removal efficiency of nitrogen tends to decrease with an increase in anoxic hrts 39 which were also observed in this study shorter hrt resulted in an enhanced biological capacity activity of denitrifying bacteria and more food to micro organisms f m ratio 38 while infinite srt has also been correlated with a greater microbial diversity due to a low selective pressure on the present microbial community thereby slower growing nitrifying and denitrifying organisms grew and made nitrogen removal possible 40 more volatile suspended solids vss concentration was also found at shorter anaerobic hrt removal efficiency of tkn was found to decrease with an increase in anaerobic hrt and decreased tano tan ratio this might be due to shorter time provided for denitrifying micro organisms to consume substrate and to perform denitrification process ultimately ending up in lower nitrogen removal 41 3 5 mlvss to mlss ratio of recycled sludge mlvss concentration increased with an increase in tano tan ratio particularly at anaerobic hrt of 90 and 120 min while at anaerobic hrt of 60 min mlvss concentration was found to increase initially and then slightly decrease with an increase in anoxic hrt maximum mlvss mlss ratio was found at 60 min 60 min ratio tano tan as shown in fig 6 this might be due to lower f m ratio at higher hrt resulting in more time for microbes to consume organic matter and ultimately entering in their death endogenous phase 42 3 6 selection of optimized operational conditions 3 6 1 carbon to nitrogen to phosphorous ratio c n p carbon to nitrogen c n and nitrogen to phosphorous n p ratios not only reflect the nutrients levels of anaerobic digesters but c n ratio is more sensitive towards the digestion process 43 optimized runs were selected on the basis of c n p ratio and ammonium nitrogen removal initially anoxic to anaerobic hrts tano tan of 45 min 60 min and 60 min 60 min were considered as optimized runs with c n ratio of 104 and 117 respectively maximum cod removal from anaerobic digester has been reported at c n ratio of 250 while biogas production ceased at c n ratio of 750 44 moreover c p ratio was calculated as 261 for a run with tano tan of 45 min 60 min and the ratio increased to 352 for a run with tano tan of 60 min 60 min britz et al 45 reported that up to 15 times decrease in phosphorous concentration was observed against cod and it did not significantly affect the rate of biogas production as c p ratio of both the selected runs did not significantly affect the biogas production potential thereby tano tan of 60 min 60 min was chosen as an optimized run as its c n ratio was relatively more suitable for anaerobic digestion as compared to the other run cod n p ratio has been calculated against each run for selecting the optimized run with a maximum potential to produce biogas at different anoxic and anaerobic hrts are presented in table 3 3 6 2 maximum potential energy within up concentrated effluent the energy requirement in the conventional activated sludge process lies in the range of 0 3 0 6 kw h m3 of treated sewage 46 47 theoretically potential energy of 15 kw h m3 has been calculated previously for an effluent stream when the system operated at tano tan of 60 min 60 min 5 in this study runs with tano tan of 45 min 60 min and 60 min 60 min were selected as optimized runs with reference to maximum potential energy stored as cod in the effluent stream details of potential energy stored against an up concentrated effluent stream coming out of the system at various hrts have been presented in table 4 3 6 3 optimized run predicted by rsm optimized runs were further predicted by rsm investigating cod tp ammonium nitrogen and tkn as responses against the two factors anoxic and anaerobic hrts and on the basis of their possible interaction and importance bbd has suggested two optimum solutions and presented in table 5 3 6 4 rsm response to cod tp nh4 n and tkn analysis of variance anova a statistical tool was used for analyzing the results and to get regression equations which fitted the predicted and actual data regression co efficient r2 value close to one not only indicates the existence of a

e tano tan of 56 min 60 min was suggested by rsm and a run with tano tan of 60 min 60 min was repeated in order to cross verify the predicted results with the actual experimental results table 6 presents the actual and predicted values of the optimized run with a maximum biogas potential of 15 5 kw h m3 theoretically calculated and for details refer table 3 and the value of c n p ratio was well within the desired range for anaerobic digestion 4 conclusions different anoxic and anaerobic hydraulic retention time hrts were evaluated to up concentrate the wastewater via biosorption sedimentation process bsp the continuous lab scale sewage up concentration experiments exhibited the clear advantage of tano tan of 60 min 60 min by considering both up concentration in terms of cod and tp and ammonium nitrogen nh4 n removal while box behnken design under rsm predicted 56 min 60 min as an optimized run and also verified the selected run the theoretical maximum potential energy from the concentrated effluent was calculated as 15 5 kw h m3 to implement the proposed technology on a full scale it is important to couple it with anaerobic polishing step in order to meet the required stringent effluent standards therefore introducing bsp in future treatment plants will not only assist in making them a net energy positive treatment plants with an enhanced biogas production

13941,to resolve the issue of existing municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps in china having an insufficient influent carbon source a continuous anaerobic anoxic aerobic a2 o process was established to treat low c chemical oxygen demand cod n total nitrogen tn c n 3 synthetic wastewater the effects of the volume ratio of anaerobic anoxic and aerobic zones vana vano vaer and the dissolved oxygen do concentration in the aerobic zones on the performance and pathway of nutrient removal were investigated during the 260 d experimental period highly efficient nutrient removal was achieved based on partial nitrification anammox pna and denitrifying phosphorus removal dpr with cod ammonia nitrogen nh4 n tn and total phosphorus tp removal rates of 81 55 97 69 87 82 and 93 60 respectively the outcomes demonstrated that partial nitrification no2 n accumulation rate of 61 38 can be achieved under the do concentration of 0 3 0 7 mg l and the ratio of vana vano vaer 1 4 3 phase 6 pna can be achieved by adding suspended carriers to the anoxic zones phase 7 after no2 n build up moreover the relative abundance of anammox bacterial at the genus level in the anoxic carrier biofilm increased to 1 37 in the end of phase 7 meanwhile the tp removal performance was improved significantly with the configuration of the pre anoxic zone in phase 7 a dpr rate of 56 43 phosphate phosphorus uptake concentration of 4 41 mg l occurred in the anoxic zones and the following phosphate phosphorus uptakes in the aerobic zones was 5 18 mg l this study suggests that the continuous a2 o process can achieve advanced nutrient removal based on pna and dpr without carbon addition by conventional process optimisation under insufficient carbon source conditions which provides a reference for improving the nutrient removal performance in practical engineering applications keywords a2 o process low c n wastewater nutrient removal anammox denitrifying phosphorus removal 1 introduction excessive nutrient nitrogen and phosphorus levels will cause deterioration and pollution of the water environment resulting in eutrophication toxic effects and disease in aquatic environments the nitrogen in wastewater is converted into nitrogen gas n2 as the final product of combined aerobic autotrophic nitrification and anoxic heterotrophic denitrification in traditional biological nutrient removal bnr processes 1 in the bnr system phosphorus accumulating organisms paos release phosphorus under anaerobic conditions and uptake phosphorus under aerobic conditions and finally remove phosphorus in the system by discharging the waste sludge 2 the bnr process as one of the most widely used sewage treatment technologies has received significant attention for many years however the carbon sources required for denitrification and phosphorus release are typically limited in low c chemical oxygen demand cod n total nitrogen tn sewage in most districts in china thereby resulting in poor nitrogen and phosphorus removal efficiencies from municipal wastewater 3 the problem of the low nitrogen and phosphorus removal efficiencies caused by insufficient carbon sources in wastewater treatment plants wwtps creates a bottleneck that bnr cannot break with the steady progress of the upgrading of wwtps in china wwtps must comply with more stringent water quality standards particularly for reductions in nitrogen and phosphorus for example in zhejiang jiangsu and hunan provinces china some wwtps have begun to implement quasi four class water quality standards tn 15 0 mg l tp 0 3 mg l therefore how to further improve the nitrogen and phosphorus removal efficiency of bnr system in the case of insufficient carbon source is of vital importance 4 external carbon sources such as acetate glucose methanol and ethanol are typically utilised as carbon additives to improve nitrogen and phosphorus removal in wwtps 5 however the high purchase cost constituting up to 70 of the total operation and maintenance costs of wwtps restricts this pathway 6 in addition novel processes can be developed to reduce the demand for carbon sources and efficiently utilise the organics in raw sewage 7 with the introduction of molecular biology and the improvement of mathematical models bnr technology has been studied further and new theories of nitrogen and phosphorus removal have been introduced the partial nitrification anammox pna process is considered a promising alternative to conventional bnr via heterotrophic denitrification 8 9 owing to its unique advantage in reducing dissolved oxygen do demand external carbon source consumption and sludge production 10 in the pna process almost 50 of ammonia nitrogen nh4 n is nitrified to nitrite nitrogen no2 n by ammonia oxidising bacteria aob as shown in eq 1 11 both the no2 n generated and the nh4 n remaining are simultaneously converted to n2 by anammox bacteria anaerobic ammonia oxidising bacteria anaob 12 as shown in eq 2 11 1 nh3 1 5 o2 no2 h2o h 2 nh3 1 32 no2 h 1 02 n2 0 26 no3 2 h2o therefore the pna process consumes 100 less organic carbon and 60 less oxygen while producing approximately 90 less sludge than traditional nitrification and denitrification 13 as for phosphorus removal the denitrifying phosphorus removal dpr process has attracted significant attention in the dpr process denitrifying polyphosphate accumulating organisms dpaos take up volatile fatty acids and store them as poly β hydroxyalkanoates phas by decomposing the stored polyphosphate under anaerobic conditions while releasing po4 3 under anoxic conditions dpaos utilise the energy from pha oxidisation to take up po4 3 nitrate nitrogen no3 n or no2 n is used as an electron acceptor for pha oxidisation and reduced to n2 14 the dpr process consumes 30 less oxygen and 50 less organic carbon while producing nearly 50 less sludge than conventional enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr which uses oxygen as an electron acceptor and is driven by paos 15 the pna process has been successfully implemented to treat high strength wastewater such as sludge digester liquor 16 17 recently mainstream pna has been studied at both the laboratory and pilot scales 18 19 and the feasibility of pna for low ammonium sewage treatment has been verified in full scale plants 20 however in these studies an environment suitable for the metabolism and reproduction of anaob for better enrichment including a proper temperature low organic matter concentration and sufficient no2 n in the influent was created deliberately this is not feasible in large scale engineering applications moreover very limited research has been conducted on how to achieve further advanced phosphorus removal once pna achieves deep level nitrogen removal the dpr process provides an alternative that can be combined with pna for advanced nitrogen and phosphorus removal from municipal sewage 12 however most previous research has focused on a single process within pna or dpr 4 13 21 only a few studies have been conducted on the treatment of low nh4 municipal sewage by pna coupled with dpr and these have been conducted in sequencing batch bioreactors sbrs 11 12 the most widely applied wastewater treatment process in china is the anaerobic anoxic aerobic a2 o process it has been adopted in approximately 31 of wwtps these wwtps treat 21 of the total volume of generated wastewater 22 separating the aeration zones and do concentration are the key factors and conventional methods to control the a2 o process they directly affect nutrient removal efficiency 3 23 24 therefore how to improve nutrient removal efficiency in a2 o processes under low c n domestic wastewater and no external carbon source by conventional methods is of great significance in this study a laboratory scale a2 o bioreactor with an effective working volume of 88 l was operated to continuously treat low c n c n 3 synthetic wastewater for 260 d the objectives of this study were to establish pna combined with dpr in a continuous a2 o bioreactor via conventional methods the effects of the volume ratio of anaerobic anoxic and aerobic zones vana vano vaer and do concentration on the nutrient removal performance of the system was monitored throughout the experiment the nutrient removal pathways were investigated through the variation of nutrients along the bioreactor and by measuring the activity of related functional bacteria in batch tests moreover the functional bacteria were detected at the genus level via illumina miseq sequencing of the v3 v4 region of 16s rrna genes this was to verify the mechanisms of nutrient removal 2 materials and methods 2 1 bioreactor operation and sludge seeding a lab scale bioreactor fig 1 with a2 o process was utilised the bioreactor was constructed from polymethyl methacrylate pmma and have an approximate effective working volume of 88 l baffles were used to divide the bioreactor into 8 compartments averagely and all compartments were equipped with independently adjustable microporous aerator pipes at the bottom so as to adjust the ratio of anoxic to aerobic zones at any time the bioreactor was operated over a 260 d period and divided into 7 phases the purpose of phase 1 6 was to investigate the performance and pathway of nutrient removal of the bioreactor by adjusting vana vano vaer under high and low do concentration to further improve the performance of nutrient removal of the bioreactor mbbr k1 suspended carriers were added in anoxic zones with an approximately 15 filling rate and the pre anoxic zone was applied in phase 7 the mbbr k1 suspended carriers were made of polyethylene and shaped like a cylinder 10 mm diameter and 10 mm high and have an effective specific surface area of 500 m2 m3 with a density of 0 98 g cm3 during the entire operational period the total influent flow was maintained at 6 0 l h and the operation was maintained at ambient temperature 23 2 c the hydraulic retention time hrt of the system was approximately 14 7 h the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss concentration in the bioreactor was maintained at 3055 3647 mg l the other conditions applied during this study are described in table 1 synthetic wastewater fed to the a2 o bioreactor was prepared from tap water it was composed of nh4cl 0 190 g l

55 and 6 mg l respectively the seed sludge was activated sludge taken from an anoxic zone of a wwtp in xi an china the daily treatment capacity of the wwtp which adopts the traditional a2 o process is 250 000 m3 the experiments were conducted after 30 d of seeding when the bioreactor reached a steady state as indicated by the relatively constant mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss concentrations along with the stable nutrients removal performance 2 2 analytical methods the concentrations of cod nh4 n no2 n no3 n tn tp phosphate phosphorus po4 3 p mlss and mlvss were determined following standard chinese state environmental protection administration methods 2002 26 the temperature and dissolved oxygen do concentrations were monitored using

5 dna extraction sludge samples from different phases were taken from activated sludge and biofilms in the last 3 days of each phase three sludge samples were taken for each phase and immediately after sampling the supernatant was separated and removed by centrifuge and stored at 20 for future use the total genomic dna of the samples was extracted using the ctab sds method the dna

shanghai china 2 7 sequence analysis the quantitative insights into microbial ecology qiime v1 8 0 pipeline was employed to process the sequencing data briefly raw sequencing reads with exact matches

that had average phred scores of 20 sequences that contained ambiguous bases and sequences that contained mononucleotide repeats of 8 bp paired end reads were assembled using flash after chimera detection the remaining high quality sequences were normalized and clustered into operational taxonomic units otus at 97 sequence identity by uclust a representative sequence was selected from each

further analysis the richness and diversity of samples were calculated with alpha diversity including shannon simpson ace and chao table s1 the rarefaction curve of samples can be seen in fig s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 long term nutrient removal performance of the system the nutrient removal performance of the system treating low c n synthetic wastewater under different volume distribution ratios and do concentrations was investigated over a 260 d operational period the average effluent concentration and removal efficiency of cod throughout the test period was 7 19 mg l and 71 63 respectively fig 2 a this demonstrated that the volume distribution ratio and do concentration had no distinct effect on cod removal the volume ratio of anoxic to aerobic zones and do concentration had a distinct impact on nh4 n and tn removal fig 2 b and c the nitrification of the system was deteriorated by reduced aerobic zones under high do conditions during phases 1 3 which was further deteriorated by reducing the do concentration in the aerobic zones during phases 4 6 however the nh4 n removal efficiency of the system exhibited a rebound during phase 6 and improved significantly during phase 7 the removal rate of nh4 n finally stabilised at 97 41 at the end of phase 7 which was close to the value of 98 31 of phase 1 moreover the aeration rate was 24 l h during phase 7 which was only 12 of the aeration rate during phase 1 200 l h thus significantly reducing the operating costs most bnr systems have poor denitrification under low c n ratio 5 2 influent conditions without the addition of an external carbon source 28 the tn removal efficiency was only 61 39 10 71 in a continuous flow bioreactor containing carriers in the anaerobic and anoxic zones under an influent c n ratio of 2 2 29 zhang et al 30 also reported that the tn removal efficiency of a modified a2 o process was maintained at only approximately 65 with an effluent tn concentration of 13 90 1 27 mg l when treating sewage with an influent c n ratio of 5 1 in this study the average effluent tn concentration of the system during phases 1 6 was 14 74 mg l with the average tn removal efficiency of 72 63 fig 2 c these were similar to previous reports 28 30 in contrast the effluent tn concentration decreased from 14 16 to 5 09 mg l after the addition of suspended carriers to anoxic zones during phase 7 and the tn removal efficiency improved to 89 03 at the end of phase 7 the outcomes showed that the system exhibited a better nh4 n and tn removal performances under the condition in phase 7 which might have been attributed to the microbial population structure and the nitrogen removal pathway in the system have changed by the process control of 7 phases so that the system can better adapt to the low c n influent conditions and have better nitrogen removal performance the average tp removal efficiency of the system during phases 1 6 was 78 79 fig 2 d the volume ratio of anoxic to aerobic zones and the do concentration had little impact on the tp removal of the system from phases 1 6 however with the configuration of the pre anoxic zone and anoxic carrier biofilms in phase 7 the average tp removal was improved to 93 60 with an effluent tp concentration of 0 39 mg l the system finally achieved advanced nutrient removal during phase 7 and the average removal efficiencies of nh4 n tn and tp were 97 41 89 03 and 93 60 with average effluent concentrations of 1 38 5 09 and 0 39 mg l respectively 3 2 achievement of partial nitrification in the system the key to achieving a partial nitrification pathway is to eliminate nob while enhancing aob activity thus achieving no2 n accumulation 31 no2 n accumulation was not observed under high do conditions during phases 1 3 fig 3 the average no2 n concentration at the end of the aerobic zone and average nar during phases 1 3 were 0 2 mg l and 0 89 respectively this indicated that the a2 o system would not achieve no2 accumulation by adjusting the volume ratio of anoxic to aerobic zones under high do conditions guisasola et al 32 reported that the oxygen affinity constants of aob and nob are 0 3 0 5 mg l and 0 7 1 8 mg l respectively indicating that aob have a stronger affinity to do than nob do in this study a low do concentration 0 3 0 7 mg l was applied after phase 3 however no2 n build up was not clear during phases 4 5 the average no2 n concentration at the end of the aerobic zone and the nar in phase 4 were 1 06 mg l and 10 44 respectively they were 1 86 mg l and 24 58 in phase 5 respectively from phase 6 the volume ratio of the anoxic to aerobic zones was adjusted to 4 3 and the hrt of the aerobic zones further decreased the average no2 n concentration at the end of the aerobic zone and the nar in phase 6 increased to 5 23 mg l and 61 38 respectively the nar finally stabilised to over 60 at the end of phase 6 this indicated that adjusting the ratio of anoxic to aerobic zones was more beneficial to the accumulation of no2 n under low do concentration 0 3 0 7 mg l in continuous a2 o process and the optimal ratio of anoxic to aerobic zones was 4 3 in this study blackburne et al 33 demonstrated that controlling the duration of aeration is important in the partial nitrification pathway in sbrs in continuous a2 o bioreactors the volume ratio of the aerobic zone has the same significance as the length of the aeration phase in sbrs reducing the volume ratio of the aerobic zone causes an insufficient hrt for nob to oxidise further no2 n to no3 n in the aerobic zones thus nob cannot fully obtain no2 substrate and their activities are suppressed at low do concentrations on the other hand nob exhibit a slower response to periodic anoxic disturbances than aob do 34 therefore at a low volume ratio in the aerobic zone and a high internal recycling rate 300 the quick alteration of aerobic to anoxic conditions inhibited nob activity a batch test was conducted to investigate the activities of aob and nob in each stage fig s2 the results showed that the reduction in aerobic zones under high do conditions does not affect the activity of aob and nob phase 1 3 however both the saor and snor decreased rapidly after low do conditions were applied phase 4 6 the saor surpassed the snor on day 19 of phase 6 this is consistent with the macro performance of the bioreactor to further investigate the microbial community structure of aob and nob the 16s rrna gene sequencing results at the genus level for activated sludge at the end of each stage of the system were sorted the aob in the system consisted of nitrosomonas and nitrosomonadaceae and the nob consisted of nitrospiraceae devosia and nitrospira table 2 the relative abundances of aob and nob at the genus level decreased from phases 3 aob 3 39 nob 5 08 to 4 aob 2 37 nob 2 48 after low do conditions were applied with the reduction in the aerobic zones the relative abundance of nob continued to decrease from phases 5 aob 1 91 nob 2 29 to 6 aob 1 61 nob 1 09 while the relative abundance of aob gradually stabilised from phases 3 to 6 78 54 of nob and 52 51 of aob were washed out by decreasing do concentration and aeration zones however the residual aob 1 61 exhibited better activity than the nob 1 09 in the end of phase 6 resulting in partial nitrification in the system the outcomes indicated that the activity of aob was higher than that of nob under the condition of phase 6 do 0 3 0 7 mg l v ana v ano v aer 1 4 3 thereby changing the nh4 n removal pathway from traditional nitrification to partial nitrification in the system 3 3 occurrence and enhancement of anammox after nitrite accumulation a stable supply of nh4 n and no2 n is the key for applying the anammox process 12 nh4 n was the main nitrogen compound in wastewater and no2 n was stably supplied through high internal recycling 300 after partial nitrification was achieved in the system which created the key conditions for the growth of anaob in addition to dilution the concentration of nh4 n decreased by 19 31 mg l in the aerobic zones in phase 1 fig 4 a while remaining constant in the anoxic zones after no2 n accumulation in phase 6 nh4 n and no2 n were simultaneously removed in the anoxic zones while the concentration of nh4 n decreased by 3 95 mg l and that of no2 n decreased by 1 77 mg l fig 4 b indicating that anammox reaction might have been occurred in the anoxic zones the anoxic carrier biofilms can create long sludge retention time and low do conditions moreover no3 n reduction can provide no2 n to favour the growth of anaob 28 therefore suspended carriers were added to the anoxic zones in phase 7 for the enrichment of anaob the concentration of nh4 n decreased by 7 03 mg l in the anoxic zones from days 257 to 259 phase 7 and that of no2 n decreased by 7 08 mg l fig 4 c these outcomes demonstrated that enhancement of anammox in the anoxic zones of the system was achieved after suspended carriers were added during phase 7 moreover the peak value of no2 n in the anoxic zones reached 8 11 mg l which was much higher than that accumulated in the aerobic zones 4 24 mg l it was speculated that there might have been other no2 production pathways in the anoxic zones during phase 7 such as the no3 to no2 process to investigate the transformation pathway of nitrogen in the anoxic zones of the system in phase 7 batch tests were conducted during the 300 min of batch test a the concentrations of no2 n and nh4 n were reduced by 6 11 mg l and 5 47 mg l respectively and the ratio of no2 n to nh4 n consumption was 1 12 meanwhile the concentration of no3 n increased by 1 52 mg l and the ratio of no3 n production to nh4 n consumption was 0 28 fig s3 a these two ratios were in line with the theoretical values of 1 32 and 0 26 11 which further proved that anammox occurred in the anoxic zones of the system in phase 7 batch test b was conducted to confirm the no2 n produced by no3 n reduction the concentrations of no3 n and nh4 n were reduced by 2 68 mg l and 2 31 mg l respectively while that of no2 n increased by 1 72 mg l in the first 75 min fig s3 b this indicated that the no3 to no2 process in anoxic zones can still provide a certain amount of electron acceptors no2 n for anaob thereby realising the anammox reaction as the carbon source was depleted the concentration of no3 n exhibited a slight increase while those of nh4 n and no2 n simultaneously decreased by 1 00 mg l and 1 52 mg l respectively for the next 105 min this indicated that the no3 to no2 process occurred in the anoxic zones of the system and supplied more electron acceptors no2 n for anaob this is beneficial for the enhancement of the anammox reaction in this study ca brocadia ca jettenia ca kuenenia and ca scalindua were detected in the flocculent sludge from the anoxic zones and anoxic carrier biofilms table 3 the relative abundance of anaob at the genus level in the original sample was 0 042 which decreased to 0 030 at the end of phase 3 under the high do condition this demonstrated that some of the anaob survived under the high do concentration from phases 1 to 3 this was possibly because the dead zones in the bioreactor provided a certain anaerobic environment for the survival of anaob after no2 n accumulation was achieved in phase 6 the relative abundance of anaob increased to 0 094 this was also the main reason why certain amounts of nh4 n and no2 n were removed simultaneously in the anoxic zones during phase 6 fig 5 b at the end of phase 7 the relative abundance of anaob in anoxic carrier biofilms increased to 1 37 changing the nitrogen removal pathway from traditional nitrification and denitrification to the pna in the system 3 4 achievement of deep level phosphorus removal the volume ratio of the anoxic to aerobic zones and do concentration had little impact on the tp removal of the system from phases 1 to 6 however with the configuration of the pre anoxic zone and anoxic carrier biofilms in phase 7 the average tp removal improved significantly fig 2 d the variations in po4 3 p no3 n and phb concentrations along the bioreactor from days 27 to 29 phase 1 and days 257 to 259 phase 7 were analysed to investigate the pathway of phosphorus removal the concentration of po4 3 p released in the anaerobic zone in phase 1 was 9 63 mg l and the following po4 3 p uptakes in the anoxic and aerobic zones were 0 69 mg l and 5 26 mg l respectively fig 5 a the ratio of po4 3 p uptake in the anoxic to aerobic zones was 13 11 thereby indicating that most of the phosphorus was removed in the aerobic zones during phase 1 which is a typical ebpr pathway 35 a large amount of no3 n 4 64 mg l was recycled into the anaerobic zone with the returned sludge thereby resulting in competition for carbon sources between denitrifying heterotrophs and paos 36 therefore the carbon sources in the wastewater for phosphorus release were insufficient and decreased the phb synthesis 5 42 mmol l from paos in the anaerobic zone this was also the main reason for the poor tp removal performance 77 46 of the system in phase 1 fig 2 d with the configuration of the pre anoxic zone in phase 7 less no3 n 1 42 mg l was recycled to the anaerobic zone and the po4 3 p release 23 85 mg l and phb 11 64 mg l synthesis in the anaerobic zone were improved compared with those in phase 1 fig 5 b sufficient phb was synthesised by paos for phosphorus uptake meanwhile a certain amount of no3 n 4 01 mg l was returned to the anoxic zones with internal recycling and the following po4 3 p uptakes in the anoxic and aerobic zones were 4 41 mg l and 5 18 mg l respectively these outcomes demonstrated that the phosphorus removal pathway changed from typical ebpr during phase 1 to dpr combined with ebpr during phase 7 and the combined phosphorus removal pathway significantly improved the tp removal performance 77 46 in phase 1 and 93 60 in phase 7 fig 2 d of the system a batch test was conducted to investigate the activity of dpaos in each stage the dpaos in anoxic zones exhibited poor activity from phases 1 to 6 with an average dpaos paos ratio of 4 60 which was in line with the average dpr rate of 12 27 fig s4 at the end of phase 7 the ratios of dpaos to paos and dpr rate increased to 64 43 and 56 43 respectively this indicated that the activity of dpaos was improved under the conditions of phase 7 to further investigate the microbial community structure of paos the 16s rrna gene sequencing results at the genus level for activated sludge at the end of each stage of the system were sorted four generally recognised genera of paos were detected in each sample namely dechloromonas ca accumulibacter acinetobacter and ca competibacter table 4 the relative abundance of the four paos fluctuated between 2 62 and 3 07 from phases 1 to 6 at the end of phase 7 the relative abundance of the four paos was increased to 4 02 which was the main reason for the good tp removal performance of the system fig 2 d the relative abundances of dechloromonas 0 74 in phase 1 and 1 41 in phase 7 and acinetobacter 0 28 in phase 1 and 0 89 in phase 7 in phase 7 increased by 90 54 and 217 86 compared with those of phase 1 respectively while the relative abundances of ca accumulibacter and ca competibacter were relatively stable from phases 1 to 7 this indicated that dechloromonas and acinetobacter played a key role in the transformation of the phosphorus removal pathway in the system 3 5 significance of this study in this study a deep level nutrient removal was achieved by adjusting the ratio of anoxic to aerobic zones and the do concentration in a continuous a2 o process for treating low c n sewage the results suggested that pna coupled with dpr can be achieved in a continuous a2 o system integrated with anoxic carrier biofilms and a pre anoxic zone throughout the experiment the special environment required for the growth and metabolism of anaob was not deliberately created e g cod concentration ph and temperature thus the relative abundance of anaob at the genus level was only 1 37 which was much lower than that of previous studies 37 38 however the results showed that even a low relative abundance of anaob can significantly improve the tn removal efficiency of continuous a2 o system fig 2 c the addition of carriers may increase the abundance of denitrifying bacteria 39 in this study the relative abundance of 4 known denitrifying bacteria genera bacillus paracoccus bacteroides and thauera were investigated the relative abundance of thauear 1 54 at the genus level was significantly enriched in anoxic carrier biofilms table s2 the results are consistent with previous studies 28 37 this is another major reason for the high nitrogen removal efficiency of the system in addition for the enhancement of the nitrogen removal performance in the a2 o process most previous studies focused on adding suspended carriers to the aerobic zone to improve the efficiency of simultaneous nitrification and denitrification and organic matter removal 40 42 in this study suspended carriers were added to the anoxic zones to improve the nitrogen removal performance and the outcomes demonstrated that the tn removal rate increased by approximately 25 with an insufficient carbon source c n 3 while the theoretical cod tn ratio of 4 1 was required for complete denitrification 37 meanwhile the aeration rate of the system decreased by 88 which greatly decreased the operating cost the removal efficiency of tp increased from 77 46 to 93 60 with the configuration of the pre anoxic zone in the a2 o process in this study highly efficient simultaneous removal of nitrogen and phosphorus was achieved under the condition of an insufficient carbon source through conventional optimisation of the continuous a2 o process and the average effluent nutrient concentration could meet the requirement of the national municipal wastewater discharge standards of china cod 50 0 mg l nh4 n 5 0 mg l tn 15 0 mg l and tp 0 5 mg l therefore this work provides a reference for improving the nutrient removal performance in practical engineering applications and the potential for energy neutrality in mainstream wwtps with a2 o processes 4 conclusions a continuous a2 o process integrated with anoxic carrier biofilms and a pre anoxic zone was established for treating synthesised low c n c n 3 wastewater with average effluent cod nh4 n tp and tn concentrations of 7 19 1 38 5 09 and 0 39 mg l respectively the optimum do concentration and v ana v ano v aer ratio were 0 3 0 7 mg l and 1 4 3 respectively for the achievement of partial nitrification anammox was enhanced by adding suspended carriers to the anoxic zones after no2 n build up at the end of the aerobic zones no2 n concentration of 5 23 mg l and nar of 61 38 meanwhile with the configuration of the pre anoxic zone a dpr rate of 56 43 po4 3 p of 4 41 mg l occurred in the anoxic zones the genera of dechloromonas and acinetobacter might have been closely related to the dpr in the system a continuous a2 o process integrated with anoxic carrier biofilms and a pre anoxic zone can achieve satisfactory nutrient removal based on pna and dpr under insufficient carbon source conditions and the aeration rate of the system can be reduced by 88 which greatly decreases the operating cost declaration of competing interest the authors do not have any conflict of interests to declare acknowledgements this study was supported by the national

13941,to resolve the issue of existing municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps in china having an insufficient influent carbon source a continuous anaerobic anoxic aerobic a2 o process was established to treat low c chemical oxygen demand cod n total nitrogen tn c n 3 synthetic wastewater the effects of the volume ratio of anaerobic anoxic and aerobic zones vana vano vaer and the dissolved oxygen do concentration in the aerobic zones on the performance and pathway of nutrient removal were investigated during the 260 d experimental period highly efficient nutrient removal was achieved based on partial nitrification anammox pna and denitrifying phosphorus removal dpr with cod ammonia nitrogen nh4 n tn and total phosphorus tp removal rates of 81 55 97 69 87 82 and 93 60 respectively the outcomes demonstrated that partial nitrification no2 n accumulation rate of 61 38 can be achieved under the do concentration of 0 3 0 7 mg l and the ratio of vana vano vaer 1 4 3 phase 6 pna can be achieved by adding suspended carriers to the anoxic zones phase 7 after no2 n build up moreover the relative abundance of anammox bacterial at the genus level in the anoxic carrier biofilm increased to 1 37 in the end of phase 7 meanwhile the tp removal performance was improved significantly with the configuration of the pre anoxic zone in phase 7 a dpr rate of 56 43 phosphate phosphorus uptake concentration of 4 41 mg l occurred in the anoxic zones and the following phosphate phosphorus uptakes in the aerobic zones was 5 18 mg l this study suggests that the continuous a2 o process can achieve advanced nutrient removal based on pna and dpr without carbon addition by conventional process optimisation under insufficient carbon source conditions which provides a reference for improving the nutrient removal performance in practical engineering applications keywords a2 o process low c n wastewater nutrient removal anammox denitrifying phosphorus removal 1 introduction excessive nutrient nitrogen and phosphorus levels will cause deterioration and pollution of the water environment resulting in eutrophication toxic effects and disease in aquatic environments the nitrogen in wastewater is converted into nitrogen gas n2 as the final product of combined aerobic autotrophic nitrification and anoxic heterotrophic denitrification in traditional biological nutrient removal bnr processes 1 in the bnr system phosphorus accumulating organisms paos release phosphorus under anaerobic conditions and uptake phosphorus under aerobic conditions and finally remove phosphorus in the system by discharging the waste sludge 2 the bnr process as one of the most widely used sewage treatment technologies has received significant attention for many years however the carbon sources required for denitrification and phosphorus release are typically limited in low c chemical oxygen demand cod n total nitrogen tn sewage in most districts in china thereby resulting in poor nitrogen and phosphorus removal efficiencies from municipal wastewater 3 the problem of the low nitrogen and phosphorus removal efficiencies caused by insufficient carbon sources in wastewater treatment plants wwtps creates a bottleneck that bnr cannot break with the steady progress of the upgrading of wwtps in china wwtps must comply with more stringent water quality standards particularly for reductions in nitrogen and phosphorus for example in zhejiang jiangsu and hunan provinces china some wwtps have begun to implement quasi four class water quality standards tn 15 0 mg l tp 0 3 mg l therefore how to further improve the nitrogen and phosphorus removal efficiency of bnr system in the case of insufficient carbon source is of vital importance 4 external carbon sources such as acetate glucose methanol and ethanol are typically utilised as carbon additives to improve nitrogen and phosphorus removal in wwtps 5 however the high purchase cost constituting up to 70 of the total operation and maintenance costs of wwtps restricts this pathway 6 in addition novel processes can be developed to reduce the demand for carbon sources and efficiently utilise the organics in raw sewage 7 with the introduction of molecular biology and the improvement of mathematical models bnr technology has been studied further and new theories of nitrogen and phosphorus removal have been introduced the partial nitrification anammox pna process is considered a promising alternative to conventional bnr via heterotrophic denitrification 8 9 owing to its unique advantage in reducing dissolved oxygen do demand external carbon source consumption and sludge production 10 in the pna process almost 50 of ammonia nitrogen nh4 n is nitrified to nitrite nitrogen no2 n by ammonia oxidising bacteria aob as shown in eq 1 11 both the no2 n generated and the nh4 n remaining are simultaneously converted to n2 by anammox bacteria anaerobic ammonia oxidising bacteria anaob 12 as shown in eq 2 11 1 nh3 1 5 o2 no2 h2o h 2 nh3 1 32 no2 h 1 02 n2 0 26 no3 2 h2o therefore the pna process consumes 100 less organic carbon and 60 less oxygen while producing approximately 90 less sludge than traditional nitrification and denitrification 13 as for phosphorus removal the denitrifying phosphorus removal dpr process has attracted significant attention in the dpr process denitrifying polyphosphate accumulating organisms dpaos take up volatile fatty acids and store them as poly β hydroxyalkanoates phas by decomposing the stored polyphosphate under anaerobic conditions while releasing po4 3 under anoxic conditions dpaos utilise the energy from pha oxidisation to take up po4 3 nitrate nitrogen no3 n or no2 n is used as an electron acceptor for pha oxidisation and reduced to n2 14 the dpr process consumes 30 less oxygen and 50 less organic carbon while producing nearly 50 less sludge than conventional enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr which uses oxygen as an electron acceptor and is driven by paos 15 the pna process has been successfully implemented to treat high strength wastewater such as sludge digester liquor 16 17 recently mainstream pna has been studied at both the laboratory and pilot scales 18 19 and the feasibility of pna for low ammonium sewage treatment has been verified in full scale plants 20 however in these studies an environment suitable for the metabolism and reproduction of anaob for better enrichment including a proper temperature low organic matter concentration and sufficient no2 n in the influent was created deliberately this is not feasible in large scale engineering applications moreover very limited research has been conducted on how to achieve further advanced phosphorus removal once pna achieves deep level nitrogen removal the dpr process provides an alternative that can be combined with pna for advanced nitrogen and phosphorus removal from municipal sewage 12 however most previous research has focused on a single process within pna or dpr 4 13 21 only a few studies have been conducted on the treatment of low nh4 municipal sewage by pna coupled with dpr and these have been conducted in sequencing batch bioreactors sbrs 11 12 the most widely applied wastewater treatment process in china is the anaerobic anoxic aerobic a2 o process it has been adopted in approximately 31 of wwtps these wwtps treat 21 of the total volume of generated wastewater 22 separating the aeration zones and do concentration are the key factors and conventional methods to control the a2 o process they directly affect nutrient removal efficiency 3 23 24 therefore how to improve nutrient removal efficiency in a2 o processes under low c n domestic wastewater and no external carbon source by conventional methods is of great significance in this study a laboratory scale a2 o bioreactor with an effective working volume of 88 l was operated to continuously treat low c n c n 3 synthetic wastewater for 260 d the objectives of this study were to establish pna combined with dpr in a continuous a2 o bioreactor via conventional methods the effects of the volume ratio of anaerobic anoxic and aerobic zones vana vano vaer and do concentration on the nutrient removal performance of the system was monitored throughout the experiment the nutrient removal pathways were investigated through the variation of nutrients along the bioreactor and by measuring the activity of related functional bacteria in batch tests moreover the functional bacteria were detected at the genus level via illumina miseq sequencing of the v3 v4 region of 16s rrna genes this was to verify the mechanisms of nutrient removal 2 materials and methods 2 1 bioreactor operation and sludge seeding a lab scale bioreactor fig 1 with a2 o process was utilised the bioreactor was constructed from polymethyl methacrylate pmma and have an approximate effective working volume of 88 l baffles were used to divide the bioreactor into 8 compartments averagely and all compartments were equipped with independently adjustable microporous aerator pipes at the bottom so as to adjust the ratio of anoxic to aerobic zones at any time the bioreactor was operated over a 260 d period and divided into 7 phases the purpose of phase 1 6 was to investigate the performance and pathway of nutrient removal of the bioreactor by adjusting vana vano vaer under high and low do concentration to further improve the performance of nutrient removal of the bioreactor mbbr k1 suspended carriers were added in anoxic zones with an approximately 15 filling rate and the pre anoxic zone was applied in phase 7 the mbbr k1 suspended carriers were made of polyethylene and shaped like a cylinder 10 mm diameter and 10 mm high and have an effective specific surface area of 500 m2 m3 with a density of 0 98 g cm3 during the entire operational period the total influent flow was maintained at 6 0 l h and the operation was maintained at ambient temperature 23 2 c the hydraulic retention time hrt of the system was approximately 14 7 h the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss concentration in the bioreactor was maintained at 3055 3647 mg l the other conditions applied during this study are described in table 1 synthetic wastewater fed to the a2 o bioreactor was prepared from tap water it was composed of nh4cl 0 190 g l

55 and 6 mg l respectively the seed sludge was activated sludge taken from an anoxic zone of a wwtp in xi an china the daily treatment capacity of the wwtp which adopts the traditional a2 o process is 250 000 m3 the experiments were conducted after 30 d of seeding when the bioreactor reached a steady state as indicated by the relatively constant mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss concentrations along with the stable nutrients removal performance 2 2 analytical methods the concentrations of cod nh4 n no2 n no3 n tn tp phosphate phosphorus po4 3 p mlss and mlvss were determined following standard chinese state environmental protection administration methods 2002 26 the temperature and dissolved oxygen do concentrations were monitored using

5 dna extraction sludge samples from different phases were taken from activated sludge and biofilms in the last 3 days of each phase three sludge samples were taken for each phase and immediately after sampling the supernatant was separated and removed by centrifuge and stored at 20 for future use the total genomic dna of the samples was extracted using the ctab sds method the dna

shanghai china 2 7 sequence analysis the quantitative insights into microbial ecology qiime v1 8 0 pipeline was employed to process the sequencing data briefly raw sequencing reads with exact matches

that had average phred scores of 20 sequences that contained ambiguous bases and sequences that contained mononucleotide repeats of 8 bp paired end reads were assembled using flash after chimera detection the remaining high quality sequences were normalized and clustered into operational taxonomic units otus at 97 sequence identity by uclust a representative sequence was selected from each otu using default parameters otu taxonomic classification was conducted by blast searching the representative sequences set against the greengenes database using the best hit an otu table was further generated to record the abundance of each otu in each sample and the taxonomy of these otus otus containing less than 0 001 of total sequences across all samples were discarded to minimize the difference of sequencing depth across samples an averaged rounded rarefied otu table was generated by averaging 100 evenly resampled otu subsets under the 90 of the minimum sequencing depth for further analysis the richness and diversity of samples were calculated with alpha diversity including shannon simpson ace and chao table s1 the rarefaction curve of samples can be seen in fig s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 long term nutrient removal performance of the system the nutrient removal performance of the system treating low c n synthetic wastewater under different volume distribution ratios and do concentrations was investigated over a 260 d operational period the average effluent concentration and removal efficiency of cod throughout the test period was 7 19 mg l and 71 63 respectively fig 2 a this demonstrated that the volume distribution ratio and do concentration had no distinct effect on cod removal the volume ratio of anoxic to aerobic zones and do concentration had a distinct impact on nh4 n and tn removal fig 2 b and c the nitrification of the system was deteriorated by reduced aerobic zones under high do conditions during phases 1 3 which was further deteriorated by reducing the do concentration in the aerobic zones during phases 4 6 however the nh4 n removal efficiency of the system exhibited a rebound during phase 6 and improved significantly during phase 7 the removal rate of nh4 n finally stabilised at 97 41 at the end of phase 7 which was close to the value of 98 31 of phase 1 moreover the aeration rate was 24 l h during phase 7 which was only 12 of the aeration rate during phase 1 200 l h thus significantly reducing the operating costs most bnr systems have poor denitrification under low c n ratio 5 2 influent conditions without the addition of an external carbon source 28 the tn removal efficiency was only 61 39 10 71 in a continuous flow bioreactor containing carriers in the anaerobic and anoxic zones under an influent c n ratio of 2 2 29 zhang et al 30 also reported that the tn removal efficiency of a modified a2 o process was maintained at only approximately 65 with an effluent tn concentration of 13 90 1 27 mg l when treating sewage with an influent c n ratio of 5 1 in this study the average effluent tn concentration of the system during phases 1 6 was 14 74 mg l with the average tn removal efficiency of 72 63 fig 2 c these were similar to previous reports 28 30 in contrast the effluent tn concentration decreased from 14 16 to 5 09 mg l after the addition of suspended carriers to anoxic zones during phase 7 and the tn removal efficiency improved to 89 03 at the end of phase 7 the outcomes showed that the system exhibited a better nh4 n and tn removal performances under the condition in phase 7 which might have been attributed to the microbial population structure and the nitrogen removal pathway in the system have changed by the process control of 7 phases so that the system can better adapt to the low c n influent conditions and have better nitrogen removal performance the average tp removal efficiency of the system during phases 1 6 was 78 79 fig 2 d the volume ratio of anoxic to aerobic zones and the do concentration had little impact on the tp removal of the system from phases 1 6 however with the configuration of the pre anoxic zone and anoxic carrier biofilms in phase 7 the average tp removal was improved to 93 60 with an effluent tp concentration of 0 39 mg l the system finally achieved advanced nutrient removal during phase 7 and the average removal efficiencies of nh4 n tn and tp were 97 41 89 03 and 93 60 with average effluent concentrations of 1 38 5 09 and 0 39 mg l respectively 3 2 achievement of partial nitrification in the system the key to achieving a partial nitrification pathway is to eliminate nob while enhancing aob activity thus achieving no2 n accumulation 31 no2 n accumulation was not observed under high do conditions during phases 1 3 fig 3 the average no2 n concentration at the end of the aerobic zone and average nar during phases 1 3 were 0 2 mg l and 0 89 respectively this indicated that the a2 o system would not achieve no2 accumulation by adjusting the volume ratio of anoxic to aerobic zones under high do conditions guisasola et al 32 reported that the oxygen affinity constants of aob and nob are 0 3 0 5 mg l and 0 7 1 8 mg l respectively indicating that aob have a stronger affinity to do than nob do in this study a low do concentration 0 3 0 7 mg l was applied after phase 3 however no2 n build up was not clear during phases 4 5 the average no2 n concentration at the end of the aerobic zone and the nar in phase 4 were 1 06 mg l and 10 44 respectively they were 1 86 mg l and 24 58 in phase 5 respectively from phase 6 the volume ratio of the anoxic to aerobic zones was adjusted to 4 3 and the hrt of the aerobic zones further decreased the average no2 n concentration at the end of the aerobic zone and the nar in phase 6 increased to 5 23 mg l and 61 38 respectively the nar finally stabilised to over 60 at the end of phase 6 this indicated that adjusting the ratio of anoxic to aerobic zones was more beneficial to the accumulation of no2 n under low do concentration 0 3 0 7 mg l in continuous a2 o process and the optimal ratio of anoxic to aerobic zones was 4 3 in this study blackburne et al 33 demonstrated that controlling the duration of aeration is important in the partial nitrification pathway in sbrs in continuous a2 o bioreactors the volume ratio of the aerobic zone has the same significance as the length of the aeration phase in sbrs reducing the volume ratio of the aerobic zone causes an insufficient hrt for nob to oxidise further no2 n to no3 n in the aerobic zones thus nob cannot fully obtain no2 substrate and their activities are suppressed at low do concentrations on the other hand nob exhibit a slower response to periodic anoxic disturbances than aob do 34 therefore at a low volume ratio in the aerobic zone and a high internal recycling rate 300 the quick alteration of aerobic to anoxic conditions inhibited nob activity a batch test was conducted to investigate the activities of aob and nob in each stage fig s2 the results showed that the reduction in aerobic zones under high do conditions does not affect the activity of aob and nob phase 1 3 however both the saor and snor decreased rapidly after low do conditions were applied phase 4 6 the saor surpassed the snor on day 19 of phase 6 this is consistent with the macro performance of the bioreactor to further investigate the microbial community structure of aob and nob the 16s rrna gene sequencing results at the genus level for activated sludge at the end of each stage of the system were sorted the aob in the system consisted of nitrosomonas and nitrosomonadaceae and the nob consisted of nitrospiraceae devosia and nitrospira table 2 the relative abundances of aob and nob at the genus level decreased from phases 3 aob 3 39 nob 5 08 to 4 aob 2 37 nob 2 48 after low do conditions were applied with the reduction in the aerobic zones the relative abundance of nob continued to decrease from phases 5 aob 1 91 nob 2 29 to 6 aob 1 61 nob 1 09 while the relative abundance of aob gradually stabilised from phases 3 to 6 78 54 of nob and 52 51 of aob were washed out by decreasing do concentration and aeration zones however the residual aob 1 61 exhibited better activity than the nob 1 09 in the end of phase 6 resulting in partial nitrification in the system the outcomes indicated that the activity of aob was higher than that of nob under the condition of phase 6 do 0 3 0 7 mg l v ana v ano v aer 1 4 3 thereby changing the nh4 n removal pathway from traditional nitrification to partial nitrification in the system 3 3 occurrence and enhancement of anammox after nitrite accumulation a stable supply of nh4 n and no2 n is the key for applying the anammox process 12 nh4 n was the main nitrogen compound in wastewater and no2 n was stably supplied through high internal recycling 300 after partial nitrification was achieved in the system which created the key conditions for the growth of anaob in addition to dilution the concentration of nh4 n decreased by 19 31 mg l in the aerobic zones in phase 1 fig 4 a while remaining constant in the anoxic zones after no2 n accumulation in phase 6 nh4 n and no2 n were simultaneously removed in the anoxic zones while the concentration of nh4 n decreased by 3 95 mg l and that of no2 n decreased by 1 77 mg l fig 4 b indicating that anammox reaction might have been occurred in the anoxic zones the anoxic carrier biofilms can create long sludge retention time and low do conditions moreover no3 n reduction can provide no2 n to favour the growth of anaob 28 therefore suspended carriers were added to the anoxic zones in phase 7 for the enrichment of anaob the concentration of nh4 n decreased by 7 03 mg l in the anoxic zones from days 257 to 259 phase 7 and that of no2 n decreased by 7 08 mg l fig 4 c these outcomes demonstrated that enhancement of anammox in the anoxic zones of the system was achieved after suspended carriers were added during phase 7 moreover the peak value of no2 n in the anoxic zones reached 8 11 mg l which was much higher than that accumulated in the aerobic zones 4 24 mg l it was speculated that there might have been other no2 production pathways in the anoxic zones during phase 7 such as the no3 to no2 process to investigate the transformation pathway of nitrogen in the anoxic zones of the system in phase 7 batch tests were conducted during the 300 min of batch test a the concentrations of no2 n and nh4 n were reduced by 6 11 mg l and 5 47 mg l respectively and the ratio of no2 n to nh4 n consumption was 1 12 meanwhile the concentration of no3 n increased by 1 52 mg l and the ratio of no3 n production to nh4 n consumption was 0 28 fig s3 a these two ratios were in line with the theoretical values of 1 32 and 0 26 11 which further proved that anammox occurred in the anoxic zones of the system in phase 7 batch test b was conducted to confirm the no2 n produced by no3 n reduction the concentrations of no3 n and nh4 n were reduced by 2 68 mg l and 2 31 mg l respectively while that of no2 n increased by 1 72 mg l in the first 75 min fig s3 b this indicated that the no3 to no2 process in anoxic zones can still provide a certain amount of electron acceptors no2 n for anaob thereby realising the anammox reaction as the carbon source was depleted the concentration of no3 n exhibited a slight increase while those of nh4 n and no2 n simultaneously decreased by 1 00 mg l and 1 52 mg l respectively for the next 105 min this indicated that the no3 to no2 process occurred in the anoxic zones of the system and supplied more electron acceptors no2 n for anaob this is beneficial for the enhancement of the anammox reaction in this study ca brocadia ca jettenia ca kuenenia and ca scalindua were detected in the flocculent sludge from the anoxic zones and anoxic carrier biofilms table 3 the relative abundance of anaob at the genus level in the original sample was 0 042 which decreased to 0 030 at the end of phase 3 under the high do condition this demonstrated that some of the anaob survived under the high do concentration from phases 1 to 3 this was possibly because the dead zones in the bioreactor provided a certain anaerobic environment for the survival of anaob after no2 n accumulation was achieved in phase 6 the relative abundance of anaob increased to 0 094 this was also the main reason why certain amounts of nh4 n and no2 n were removed simultaneously in the anoxic zones during phase 6 fig 5 b at the end of phase 7 the relative abundance of anaob in anoxic carrier biofilms increased to 1 37 changing the nitrogen removal pathway from traditional nitrification and denitrification to the pna in the system 3 4 achievement of deep level phosphorus removal the volume ratio of the anoxic to aerobic zones and do concentration had little impact on the tp removal of the system from phases 1 to 6 however with the configuration of the pre anoxic zone and anoxic carrier biofilms in phase 7 the average tp removal improved significantly fig 2 d the variations in po4 3 p no3 n and phb concentrations along the bioreactor from days 27 to 29 phase 1 and days 257 to 259 phase 7 were analysed to investigate the pathway of phosphorus removal the concentration of po4 3 p released in the anaerobic zone in phase 1 was 9 63 mg l and the following po4 3 p uptakes in the anoxic and aerobic zones were 0 69 mg l and 5 26 mg l respectively fig 5 a the ratio of po4 3 p uptake in the anoxic to aerobic zones was 13 11 thereby indicating that most of the phosphorus was removed in the aerobic zones during phase 1 which is a typical ebpr pathway 35 a large amount of no3 n 4 64 mg l was recycled into the anaerobic zone with the returned sludge thereby resulting in competition for carbon sources between denitrifying heterotrophs and paos 36 therefore the carbon sources in the wastewater for phosphorus release were insufficient and decreased the phb synthesis 5 42 mmol l from paos in the anaerobic zone this was also the main reason for the poor tp removal performance 77 46 of the system in phase 1 fig 2 d with the configuration of the pre anoxic zone in phase 7 less no3 n 1 42 mg l was recycled to the anaerobic zone and the po4 3 p release 23 85 mg l and phb 11 64 mg l synthesis in the anaerobic zone were improved compared with those in phase 1 fig 5 b sufficient phb was synthesised by paos for phosphorus uptake meanwhile a certain amount of no3 n 4 01 mg l was returned to the anoxic zones with internal recycling and the following po4 3 p uptakes in the anoxic and aerobic zones were 4 41 mg l and 5 18 mg l respectively these outcomes demonstrated that the phosphorus removal pathway changed from typical ebpr during phase 1 to dpr combined with ebpr during phase 7 and the combined phosphorus removal pathway significantly improved the tp removal performance 77 46 in phase 1 and 93 60 in phase 7 fig 2 d of the system a batch test was conducted to investigate the activity of dpaos in each stage the dpaos in anoxic zones exhibited poor activity from phases 1 to 6 with an average dpaos paos ratio of 4 60 which was in line with the average dpr rate of 12 27 fig s4 at the end of phase 7 the ratios of dpaos to paos and dpr rate increased to 64 43 and 56 43 respectively this indicated that the activity of dpaos was improved under the conditions of phase 7 to further investigate the microbial community structure of paos the 16s rrna gene sequencing results at the genus level for activated sludge at the end of each stage of the system were sorted four generally recognised genera of paos were detected in each sample namely dechloromonas ca accumulibacter acinetobacter and ca competibacter table 4 the relative abundance of the four paos fluctuated between 2 62 and 3 07 from phases 1 to 6 at the end of phase 7 the relative abundance of the four paos was increased to 4 02 which was the main reason for the good tp removal performance of the system fig 2 d the relative abundances of dechloromonas 0 74 in phase 1 and 1 41 in phase 7 and acinetobacter 0 28 in phase 1 and 0 89 in phase 7 in phase 7 increased by 90 54 and 217 86 compared with those of phase 1 respectively while the relative abundances of ca accumulibacter and ca competibacter were relatively stable from phases 1 to 7 this indicated that dechloromonas and acinetobacter played a key role in the transformation of the phosphorus removal pathway in the system 3 5 significance of this study in this study a deep level nutrient removal was achieved by adjusting the ratio of anoxic to aerobic zones and the do concentration in a continuous a2 o process for treating low c n sewage the results suggested that pna coupled with dpr can be achieved in a continuous a2 o system integrated with anoxic carrier biofilms and a pre anoxic zone throughout the experiment the special environment required for the growth and metabolism of anaob was not deliberately created e g cod concentration ph and temperature thus the relative abundance of anaob at the genus level was only 1 37 which was much lower than that of previous studies 37 38 however the results showed that even a low relative abundance of anaob can significantly improve the tn removal efficiency of continuous a2 o system fig 2 c the addition of carriers may increase the abundance of denitrifying bacteria 39 in this study the relative abundance of 4 known denitrifying bacteria genera bacillus paracoccus bacteroides and thauera were investigated the relative abundance of thauear 1 54 at the genus level was significantly enriched in anoxic carrier biofilms table s2 the results are consistent with previous studies 28 37 this is another major reason for the high nitrogen removal efficiency of the system in addition for the enhancement of the nitrogen removal performance in the a2 o process most previous studies focused on adding suspended carriers to the aerobic zone to improve the efficiency of simultaneous nitrification and denitrification and organic matter removal 40 42 in this study suspended carriers were added to the anoxic zones to improve the nitrogen removal performance and the outcomes demonstrated that the tn removal rate increased by approximately 25 with an insufficient carbon source c n 3 while the theoretical cod tn ratio of 4 1 was required for complete denitrification 37 meanwhile the aeration rate of the system decreased by 88 which greatly decreased the operating cost the removal efficiency of tp increased from 77 46 to 93 60 with the configuration of the pre anoxic zone in the a2 o process in this study highly efficient simultaneous removal of nitrogen and phosphorus was achieved under the condition of an insufficient carbon source through conventional optimisation of the continuous a2 o process and the average effluent nutrient concentration could meet the requirement of the national municipal wastewater discharge standards of china cod 50 0 mg l nh4 n 5 0 mg l tn 15 0 mg l and tp 0 5 mg l therefore this work provides a reference for improving the nutrient removal performance in practical engineering applications and the potential for energy neutrality in mainstream wwtps with a2 o processes 4 conclusions a continuous a2 o process integrated with anoxic carrier biofilms and a pre anoxic zone was established for treating synthesised low c n c n 3 wastewater with average effluent cod nh4 n tp and tn concentrations of 7 19 1 38 5 09 and 0 39 mg l respectively the optimum do concentration and v ana v ano v aer ratio were 0 3 0 7 mg l and 1 4 3 respectively for the achievement of partial nitrification anammox was enhanced by adding suspended carriers to the anoxic zones after no2 n build up at the end of the aerobic zones no2 n concentration of 5 23 mg l and nar of 61 38 meanwhile with the configuration of the pre anoxic zone a dpr rate of 56 43 po4 3 p of 4 41 mg l occurred in the anoxic zones the genera of dechloromonas and acinetobacter might have been closely related to the dpr in the system a continuous a2 o process integrated with anoxic carrier biofilms and a pre anoxic zone can achieve satisfactory nutrient removal based on pna and dpr under insufficient carbon source conditions and the aeration rate of the system can be reduced by 88 which greatly decreases the operating cost declaration of competing interest the authors do not have any conflict of interests to declare acknowledgements this study was supported by the national

13942,herein we report the synthesis of electron rich tcta pvp conjugated polymer cp modified with cuo nps as a photocatalyst for water remediation and disinfection under visible light λ 420 nm cp cuo showed an extended visible light response up to 900 nm the photoactivities of bare cp cp cu and cp cuo with and without peroxymonosulfate pms addition were tested towards the oxidation of mb under visible light it was found that the incorporation of cu ii or cuo into cp platform enhances the photocatalytic activity and pms activation due to the synergistic effects in terms of better visible light response and high yield photogenerated reactive oxygen species in addition rich electron cp can help the redox recycling of cu i and cu ii species via electron transfer from cp to cuo under visible light which in turn facilitates the activation of pms hso5 to hso4 radicals the photocatalytic antibacterial activity of cp cuo by considering e coli inactivation in water under uv vis light was investigated keywords electron rich polymer cuo photo antibacterial activity dye oxidation photocatalysis 1 introduction effective remediation of water contaminated with hazardous substances including chemicals and microorganisms is a global issue due to the several serious consequences associated with human health and environment engineers and research communities are currently seeking to develop economical and efficient strategies for water remediation and disinfection that can be applied in the real world over more than three decades heterogenous photocatalysis as one of the advanced oxidation processes aops has traveled a long scientific and technological path as an eco friendly system for water remediation and energy production 1 3 the development of efficient visible light photoactive materials for water remediation has been the most popular subject in this field since the efficiency of the photocatalytic process is correlated directly to the characteristics of the photocatalyst used including the ability of light absorption charges formation and separation and the capability to produce reactive oxygen species ross or free electrons in the former case several strategies have been investigated to enhance the efficiency of semiconductors under solar light including doping heterojunction systems photosensitizing by organic molecules and carbonaceous semiconductor materials 4 6 more recently some researchers began to develop divers conjugated polymers as photoactive materials for photocatalysis applications owing to their high electronic transitions under a wide range of visible light 7 9 unlike most of the inorganic semiconductors conjugated polymer materials as photocatalysts exhibit many valuable features such as eco friendly high redox ability better visible light absorption and efficient separation of photogenerated charge carriers herein for synergistic effects cuo inorganic semiconductor nanoparticles were introduced into the platform of conjugated polymer cp prepared via polymerization of rich electron tcta tris 4 carbazoyl 9 ylphenyl amine with pvp cp cuo photoactive composite was tested for the photocatalytic oxidation of methylene blue and the inactivation of escherichia coli in water 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthesis and characterization of materials the conjugated polymer cp was synthesized via the heat polymerization of 0 10 mmol of tris 4 carbazoyl 9 ylphenyl amine tcta with 8 g of polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp and 0 60 mmol of 4 4 bipyridine in 5 ml dmf 5 ml h2o solution at 70 c for 4 h then the heating was turned off and the mixture was stirred for 24 h afterwards the gel was dried at 90 c for two days followed by calcination at 250 c for 1 h cuo was synthesized by the coprecipitation method using cuso4 5h2o and naoh as precursors cp cu or cp cuo was prepared by adding a desired quantity of cu ii or cuo nps corresponding to 20 to the gel of cp and then the heating and calcination were continued the materials were characterized by sem edax xrd xps and uv drs 2 2 photocatalytic experiments the photocatalytic activities of pure cp cp cu and cp cuo were tested for the degradation of methylene blue mb under visible light using 300 w xenon lamp light equipped with quartz uv cut off filter λ 420 nm the photocatalytic inactivation of escherichia coli e coli a gram negative bacterium under uv vis light was also carried out in aqueous solution e coli was firstly incubated in lysogeny broth lb then in test tubes 1 ml of e coli having 1 107 cfu ml 1 was mixed with 20 mg of cp cuo with 15 ml of lb broth as a control a tube without photocatalyst was also prepared these tubes were subjected immediately to photocatalytic treatment using tube swing rotary shaker under pls sxe300 xenon lamp light irradiation 300 1100 nm at room temperature the inactivation of e coli was validated through the viability of bacterial cells by the spread plate method the spread plate method shows the number of colony forming units cfu on plate counter agar 200 μl aliquots were aseptically taken out after 2 and 4 h and spread on agar plates and incubated at 37 c for 14 h and then the number of bacterial colonies was counted to obtain the cfu reduction efficiency in broth solutions 3 results and discussion sem and edax mapping images of cp cuo composite are shown in fig 1 it can be seen clearly that cp cuo is mostly of organic nature the distribution of cuo nps is well observed by edax as shown in fig 1 e the surface of the composite is non porous and smooth which suggests that the catalytic reactions may happen on the external surface of cp cuo x ray diffraction patterns recorded on cp cuo cp cu and cp cuo samples are presented in fig 1 g the results indicate that the materials are of amorphous nature while in terms of cp cuo diffraction peaks at 2θ 35 8 and 2θ 38 7 were produced corresponded to 002 and 111 of cuo nps uv drs spectra of cp cp cu cuo and cp cuo are shown in fig 1 h bare cp showed a good visible light response due to the conjugation system in the organic platform it can be seen that the introduction of cu ii ions into cp platform leads to enhance further the absorption of visible light cu ii species can change the structure of cp via the development of new bonding with tcta 10 or pvp and therefore an enhanced absorption of light can be found bare cuo nps exhibits a good visible light response as presented in fig 1 h therefore the combination of cp and cuo gives a higher visible light response xps photoelectron for c o n and cu species was recorded fig 2 spectra of c1s show three peaks due to cc cc cc ccn co and ccn n respectively there was no peak shifting in c1s spectra after the addition of cuo nps to the cp however a slight change in the surface area of peaks was observed one single band was observed in high resolution o1s spectra due to co in cp and co cuo in cp cuo furthermore high resolution n1s shows a single band in cp and cp cuo spectra which corresponded to nco ncn and n c 3 existed in pvp 4 4 bipyridine and tcta compounds respectively in high resolution cu 2p spectrum fig 2 d the binding energies of cu 2p3 2 and cu 2p1 2 are located at 933 4 and 953 4 ev respectively wherein the gap between peaks is 20 ev which suggested the formation of standard spectrum of cuo nps 11 to be noted that no shakeup satellite peaks for cu 2p were produced which denies the formation of cu2o phase the comparative photoactivities of cp cp cu and cp cuo towards the oxidation of mb was carried out under visible light and the results are shown in fig 3 a bare cp showed good efficiency for mb degradation due to the production of ross under visible light photoexcited cp can produce coulomb correlated electron hole pairs following by diffusion to interface to form charge separated states tcta introduced into pvp backbone due to its high lumo 2 4 ev can reduce efficiency o2 to o2 species e0 o2 o2 0 33 v vs the nhe at ph 7 furthermore h2o2 can be produced via proton dependent reduction of o2 e0o2 h2o2 0 89 v vs the nhe at ph 7 the generation of ho species can be realized via the reduction of h2o2 by lumo or the reaction of o2 and h2o2 cp cu showed a slight increase in the efficiency compared to bare cp which may be due to the better visible light absorption and the catalytic role of cu ii species however in terms of cp cuo an obvious enhancement in the degradation of efficiency of mb was found which is the result of synergistic effects of cp and cuo in terms of higher light harvesting and charges formation and separation additionally cuo itself is an indirect bandgap semiconductor which can absorb visible light and produce ross 12 to confirm the participation of ross for the oxidation of mb by cp cuo under visible light tests were carried out in the presence of tert butyl alcohol p benzoquinone and sodium oxalate as scavengers for ho o2 and h respectively fig 3 b as a result the oxidation rate of mb was decreased significantly in the presence of ross scavengers on the other hand the addition of pms 10 μm leads to enhance the speed of oxidation in cp cu and cp cuo systems while low pms activation was detected in the case of pure cp cuo and copper based photocatalyst are known as effective materials for pms activation 13 15 as shown in fig 3 c in cp cu ii and cp cuo systems the photogenerated electrons in cp platform may reduce cu ii to cu i and then cu i can react with pms hso5 to form hso4 which can participate directly in the oxidation of mb in addition hso4 can react with h2o molecules to form ho species 16 the antibacterial activity of cp cuo was investigated by considering e coli inactivation in water under uv vis light for the purpose of comparison photolysis experiment under uv vis light for e coli inactivation without cp cuo was also carried out the results of plate testes are presented in fig 3 d it can be seen that the combination of cp cuo and light really inhibits the growth of e coli in plate after 2 h of photocatalytic treatment and more importantly after 4 h however under uv vis light irradiation without cp cuo the plate was completely covered with e coli species we deduce that the inactivation of e coli was ascribed to the formation of ross in cp cuo light system ross with longer life such as h2o2 and o2 are mostly active for bacteria degradation than short life living ross since the damage of bacteria needs a quit long process including the penetration of outer bacterial membrane and cell wall 17 many studies reported the significant photocatalytic activity of cuo for bacteria inactivation 18 copper oxide nps can kill the bacteria via denaturation or oxidation by photogenerated ross in terms of photooxidation the redox cycling between cu i and cu ii species is very effective for the generation of o2 species 19 as above mentioned the transfer of electrons from cp to the cuo nps under light can help the production of higher yield ross for bacteria inactivation 4 conclusion this study showed that the combination of electron rich tcta pvp polymer with cuo nps leads to enhance the photocatalytic activity towards dye oxidation and e coli inactivation the transfer of electrons from platform of polymer to cuo can activate the redox cycling between cu i and cu ii which in turn results in higher yield ross the redox cycling of cu i cu ii is very efficient also for pms activation and bacteria inactivation soft visible light photoactive cp cuo as a heterogeneous photocatalyst could be a suitable material for water remediation disinfection under solar light at large scale application declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

to form ho species 16 the antibacterial activity of cp cuo was investigated by considering e coli inactivation in water under uv vis light for the purpose of comparison photolysis experiment under uv vis light for e coli inactivation without cp cuo was also carried out the results of plate testes are presented in fig 3 d it can be seen that the combination of cp cuo and light really inhibits the growth of e coli in plate after 2 h of photocatalytic treatment and more importantly after 4 h however under uv vis light irradiation without cp cuo the plate was completely covered with e coli species we deduce that the inactivation of e coli was ascribed to the formation of ross in cp cuo light system ross with longer life such as h2o2 and o2 are mostly active for bacteria degradation than short life living ross since the damage of bacteria needs a quit long process including the penetration of outer bacterial membrane and cell wall 17 many studies reported the significant photocatalytic activity of cuo for bacteria inactivation 18 copper oxide nps can kill the bacteria via denaturation or oxidation by photogenerated ross in terms of photooxidation the redox cycling between cu i and cu ii species is very effective for the generation of o2 species 19 as above mentioned the transfer of electrons from cp to the cuo nps under light can help the production of higher yield ross for bacteria inactivation 4 conclusion this study showed that the combination of electron rich tcta pvp polymer with cuo nps leads to enhance the photocatalytic activity towards dye oxidation and e coli inactivation the transfer of electrons from platform of polymer to cuo can activate the redox cycling between cu i and cu ii which in turn results in higher yield ross the redox cycling of cu i cu ii is very efficient also for pms activation and bacteria inactivation soft visible light photoactive cp cuo as a heterogeneous photocatalyst could be a suitable material for water

13943,discharge of untreated oily wastewaters could bring about dire consequences such as environmental catastrophes in order to address this problem a photocatalytic membrane reactor pmr comprised of tio2 γ al2o3 modified ceramic membrane was prepared for treatment of synthetic oily wastewater under uv illumination the structure morphology and phase composition of the layer of modified membranes were characterized through analysis of scanning electron microscopy sem and x ray powder diffraction xrd images the main influencing parameters on permeate flux and total organic carbon toc removal were flow rate transmembrane pressure tmp tio2 photocatalysts and feed oil concentration additionally photocatalytic activity of the tio2 γ al2o3 modified ceramic membrane was investigated it was found that toc removal efficiency of the tio2 γ al2o3 modified ceramic membrane upon uv illumination considerably improved the average permeate fluxes of the tio2 γ al2o3 modified ceramic membrane for 500 and 1000 ppm oil as feed were around 1053 and 966 l m2 h respectively under the applied 1 5 bar tmp and flow rate of 32 16 ml min significant removal efficiencies higher than 90 were achieved under the mentioned conditions the experimental results achieved through this research enable us to develop the opportunity for oily wastewater treatment and its responsible disposal on a large scale for environmentally friendly purposes keywords photocatalytic membrane reactor ceramic membrane oily wastewater 1 introduction a great deal of oily wastewater is produced on a daily basis worldwide considering numerous environmental damages of irresponsible disposal of oily wastewater including soil pollution surface and ground water contamination as well as marine pollution treatment processes have drawn both conservationists and experts attention within last years it is reported that oily wastewater produced by different industries such as oil gas petroleum refineries pharmaceutical metallurgical fertilizers and petrochemicals frequently contains highly toxic hydrocarbons in concentration of 50 1000 mg l 1 4 as a consequence there is a crucial need for treatment of oily wastewater before its safe disposal to limit the concentration of hydrocarbons to 10 15 mg l 5 8 in order to tackle this issue a wide variety of techniques such as advanced oxidation process aop membrane filtration ultrasonic separation coagulation air flotation chemical de emulsification and gravity settling for treatment of oily wastewater have been employed within recent years 9 10 these methods however could not meet with success in terms of uneconomical operating costs wide space requirement and production of secondary contaminants 11 so other viable alternative methods need to be replaced by researchers to alleviate the problem for instance li et al 2018 introduced a novel approach whereby green inexpensive desert sands with under oil hydrophilicity were used to develop into a layer through washing drying and stacking processes for effective gravity directed separation of water in oil emulsions the main advantages of this approach were about eliminating the fabrication process of membranes and expensive low energy substances of fluorosilane used in conventional superhydrophobic materials 12 however among all offered techniques aop as an emerging flexible approach for treatment of toxic oily wastewater has met treatment standards somewhat due to its capability to eliminate various organic substances and non degradable toxic wastes present in effluents 13 some aops however have been phased out because of the fact that a considerable proportion of residual toxic waste and catalysts are maintained and could not be either degraded or recovered 14 in order to promote the efficiency of hazardous wastewater treatment an aop i e photocatalytic reactor can be coupled with membrane filtration process as a single unit named photocatalytic membrane reactor pmr while degradation and mineralization of organic contaminants to co2 h2o and mineral salts is the primary function of a photocatalysis process the assessment of a membrane is widely based on its permeability and selectivity 13 15 membranes are made of various materials including organics i e polymeric membranes and inorganics i e ceramic membranes long et al 2018 fabricated superwettable coprinus comatus cc coated pvdf membrane through vacuum filtration for separation of oil water emulsions this integrated system could still achieve excellent separation efficiencies 99 after 6 cycles 16 in another study carried out by wang et al 2019 a novel loess coated pvdf membrane was prepared through deposition of the loess and sodium alginate suspension onto the membrane surface with a vacuum pump for oil in water emulsion separation it was found that the modified membrane showed a great potential in terms of separation efficiencies around 99 6 even after 10 cycles and permeate flux of 910 4 l m2 h bar 17 inorganic membranes particularly ceramic membranes have generally proved their superiority over polymeric membranes for industrial use due to their superior qualities such as higher selectivity noticeable permeation rate remarkable chemical and thermal stability ease of membrane recovery through calcination or backward stream of water and noteworthy longevity 18 19 additionally while bacteria bring about bio fouling degradation in the case of polymeric membranes it is found that ceramic membranes are highly unlikely damaged by bacteria 20 the primary purpose of a pmr system is to take full advantage of both photocatalysis and membrane separation process simultaneously enabling the system to not only separate a broad range of pollutants via membrane filtration process which can exploit its potential as a selective barrier for some substances to be degraded and a barrier for photocatalyst but also to degrade various organic compounds present in effluents into non toxic inorganic molecules through photocatalytic activities under uv irradiation 15 21 tio2 nanoparticles well known as photocatalysts are widely used in experimental studies owing to their thermal and physical strength reasonable price and outstanding photocatalytic and anti fouling features 22 23 forming active oxidants such as hydroxyl radicals tio2 photocatalysts play a key role in not only photocatalysis in aops but also in degradation and decomposition of contaminants to less harmful substances 15 there are some relevant researches which were recently carried out to investigate the efficiency of pmrs for instance horovitz et al 2018 reported an extremely effective pmr equipped with n doped tio2 coated microfiltration mf al2o3 membrane for removal of ms2 virus with regard to the importance of ms2 bacteriophage interaction with the pmr for photocatalytic and non photocatalytic virus inactivation 24 in another experiment conducted by rani and karthikeyan 2018 an integrated slurry pmr consisted of polyethersulphone pes membrane and tio2 photocatalysts was prepared which not only reached 97 of phenanthrene phe photodegradation and 79 of toc removal efficiency but also could efficiently reuse tio2 25 moreover ahmad et al 2019 prepared a photocatalytic ceramic membrane which was modified through direct growth of tio2 nanostructures on a al2o3 membrane resulting in superior membrane performance with enhanced anti fouling properties and efficient organic removal 26 additionally qilong et al 2019 reported a well designed ceramic based submerged pmr combined with suspended tio2 photocatalysts which achieved a successful treatment of refractory antibiotic organic compounds 27 the present research proposes to inspect the performance of a pmr consisted of γ al2o3 coated ceramic membrane with immobilized tio2 photocatalysts on its surface for treatment of synthetic oily wastewater upon uv irradiation in this integrated system γ al2o3 coated ceramic membrane played a dual role as a support for tio2 photocatalysts and a physical selective barrier for rejected substances the main focus of this research is to evaluate the performance of the pmr system under uv irradiation in terms of permeate flux and toc removal under the influence of major parameters including flow rate tmp tio2 photocatalysts and feed oil concentration 2 experimental 2 1 preparation of thin films in order to prepare γ al2o3 thin film aluminium tri sec butylate c2h5ch ch3 o 3al was hydrolyzed in distilled water at temperature of 80 c molar ratio water astb 100 and the white hastened boehmite began to stir well for 30 min 0 12 mol of nitric acid per mole of aluminium was then added which caused an aqueous hno3 solution 1 5 mol l as a result of this the boehmite suspension was guided towards peptization which produced a stable sol the polyvinyl alcohol pva 12 wt in aqueous solution was added to the sol suspension in the final stage because of the viscosity adjustment 28 additionally in order to form tio2 thin film three merck made chemicals were employed including titanium tetraisopropoxide ttip as the source of tio2 high purity 99 5 ethanol as solvent and 65 nitric acid with molar ratios of 1 34 0 35 respectively 29 30 after dissolution of ttip in ethanol under 15 min of agitation gradual addition of nitric acid while stirring for extra 2 h resulted a transparent light yellow color tio2 sol 30 32 2 2 preparation of ceramic membranes the disc shaped ultrafiltration uf ceramic membranes were used with thickness and diameter of 2 mm and 3 cm respectively which were prepared by research institute of petroleum industry ripi through dry pressing under the conditions of operating pressure and firing temperature of 415 mpa and 1500 c respectively with 2 h soaking time the γ al2o3 thin films were then prepared through deposition of colloidal boehmite sol obtained from sol gel method during 30 min of dip coating coatings were performed on only one side of the ceramic membranes in the next stage the γ al2o3 coated ceramic membranes were fired at a temperature of 110 c followed by heating the gel layer at 500 c for 2 h with heating rate of 2 c min for calcination purposes 33 moreover the top layer of some of γ al2o3 coated ceramic membranes were modified through deposition of tio2 sol obtained from sol gel method on the same side of γ al2o3 thin films for about 30 min of dip coating then the tio2 γ al2o3 modified ceramic membranes were heat treated at room temperature for 24 h and eventually they were fired at temperature of 450 c for 2 h with heating rate of 2 c min ultimately in order to conduct a comparative analysis experiments were conducted by using both of the γ al2o3 coated and tio2 γ al2o3 modified ceramic membranes 2 3 pmr fabrication and experimental procedure the filtration processes were operated in dead end mode fig 1 in order to carry out operations a pmr system was employed in batch mode the system consisted of a cylindrical membrane module with the dimensions 13 3 cm h 7 5 cm d in which the disc shaped ceramic membrane with effective surface area of 3 302 cm2 was placed in addition a uv lamp with a maximum light intensity output at 254 nm model g4 t5 4 w philips co holland was installed between the inner and outer walls of the membrane module a feed tank containing a magnet inside with approximate capacity of 4 l was positioned on a stirrer to constantly keep the feed in a certain concentration the feed tank was directly linked to both the membrane module and a nitrogen gas tank the synthetic oily wastewater was transferred from the feed tank to the membrane module under the pressure force provided by the gas tank the permeate samples were gathered in a vessel sited under the membrane module and the content of vessel was permanently measured as a function of time by using a digital balance model and ek 600i tmps and flow rates were applied in the range of 0 5 2 bar and 10 8 51 7 ml min respectively during the experiments each experiment was carried out for 1 h at room temperature 2 4 structural characterization of modified ceramic membranes in order to characterize the morphology and structure of the γ al2o3 coated and tio2 γ al2o3 modified ceramic membranes sem images of the top surface and cross section of modified membranes provided by a scanning electron microscope model tescon vega co were analyzed in order to analyze the phase composition of the tio2 modified layer of γ al2o3 coated ceramic membranes xrd patterns were provided by a bruker d4 diffractometer germany with cu kα radiation of λ 1 54060 a and a step size of 0 02 in the 2θ ranged from 20 to 70 to determine the kinetic of organics photoreaction on membrane surface the langmuir hinshelwood equation eq 1 was used in this equation the degradation rate r mg l min is linked to the concentration of organic compound c mg l 34 1 r dc dt k r k ad c 1 k ad c where k r represents the intrinsic rate constant mg l min and k ad is the adsorption equilibrium constant l mg it is worth mentioning that if the adsorption is not strong sufficiently and or the amount of organic compound is not high the langmuir hinshelwood equation is shortened to a first order equation eq 2 35 2 ln c c 0 k r k ad t k app t in which t is the reaction time c represents concentration at time t c 0 indicates the initial concentration and k app is the overall degradation rate constant 1 min plotting ln c c 0 versus reaction time t results in a straight line whereby the slope determines the k app in order to evaluate the photocatalytic activity of tio2 photocatalysts that were deposited on the top layer of γ al2o3 coated ceramic membrane 5 ppm methylene blue mb was prepared the solution was magnetically blended for about 30 min under dark conditions for adsorption desorption equilibrium purposes in the next stage uv illumination became involved and samples were gathered at 15 minute intervals between 0 and 90 min in order to determine the photodegradation efficiencies absorption spectra of mb samples were achieved by a uv vis spectrophotometer model jasco v 670 in the wavelength range of 400 800 nm 2 5 analytical methods in order to calculate the permeate flux of treated oily wastewater permeates were measured at regular intervals during the operations with regard to the effective surface area of 3 302 cm2 in general permeate flux is calculated as below eq 3 36 3 j q a t in which q represents the volume of permeate l a indicates the surface area of membrane m2 and t is permeate time in addition the amount of toc present in feed and permeate samples was evaluated by using a toc analyzer model rosemount analytical dc 190 america toc removal efficiency is calculated as below eq 4 36 4 t o c r e m o v a l e f f i c i e n c y 1 c p c t 100 where c p and c t represent the toc concentration in permeate and feed respectively 2 5 1 preparation of synthetic oily wastewater the synthetic oily wastewater as the sample feed was prepared by using oil in two different concentrations of 500 and 1000 ppm 0 5 and 1 g of oil were separately added to 1000 ml of distilled water each of which was then combined with 0 075 and 0 08 g of the surfactant polyoxyethylene sorbitan trioleate tween 85 respectively stable emulsions were prepared by using a mixer model heidolph rzr at 800 rpm for 15 min 3 results and discussion 3 1 morphology and structural characterization in order to analyze the morphology and characteristics of the γ al2o3 coated and tio2 γ al2o3 modified ceramic membranes sem images were provided figs 2 and 3 it was observed that pores became intrinsically narrow and well organized as well due to the deposition of tio2 layer it was also shown that the tio2 particles were coated densely and homogeneously reducing the mean pore size of the membrane fig 3 however we could not present the percentage of the reduced mean pore size the characteristic peaks of the crystal planes of anatase and rutile were confirmed by the xrd image related to the tio2 layer of the γ al2o3 coated ceramic membrane after being annealed at temperature of 450 c fig 4 jcpds card no 21 1272 and jcpds card no 21 1276 the existence of both anatase and rutile phases was confirmed and it was observed that anatase was the major phase of the xrd spectrum additionally the obtained results from other studies showed that synthesized anatase tio2 nanoparticles showed better photocatalytic activity compared to rutile phase 37 40 with regard to its higher crystallinity anatase is more appropriate for photocatalysis because of the fact that the higher the crystallinity is the less defects as recombination sites between photogenerated electrons and holes are offered 38 thus it was confirmed that the tio2 γ al2o3 modified ceramic membranes predominantly included anatase phase enabling them to have high photocatalytic activity 3 2 photocatalytic activity measurement as mentioned previously the photocatalytic activity of the tio2 γ al2o3 modified ceramic membrane was investigated in a batch study according to the eq 2 with the data obtained from the analysis of the samples by uv vis spectrophotometer fig 5 it was found that the amount of absorbance reduced during the time confirming the acceptable photodegradation rate of mb under uv irradiation by the tio2 γ al2o3 modified ceramic membrane so by plotting ln c c 0 versus reaction time t the k app could be easily found for each sample through the slope of each line fig 6 it is worth mentioning that k app is widely known as a criterion for evaluating the membrane photocatalytic activity it was observed that the tio2 photocatalysts showed an increasing photocatalytic activity upon uv illumination during the time a reasonable explanation can be offered by the strong oxidants generated by tio2 photocatalysts under uv irradiation oxidizing a great deal of organics 36 3 3 filtration tests 3 3 1 pure water and oily wastewater permeate flux measurement membrane permeability dependence on the type of feed was evaluated through filtration of synthetic oily wastewater and distilled water as distinct types of feed it was observed that the permeate flux of distilled water for both of the γ al2o3 coated and tio2 γ al2o3 modified ceramic membranes remained constant over the whole period shown nearly about 5580 and 7340 l m2 h respectively figs 7 and 8 however when oil with 500 and 1000 ppm concentration was used as feed the permeate fluxes of both of the membranes were significantly lower compared to the permeation of distilled water while in the case of γ al2o3 coated ceramic membrane permeate flux steadily decreased during the time by about 214 and 269 l m2 h for filtration of 500 and 1000 ppm oil respectively permeate flux of the tio2 γ al2o3 modified ceramic membrane for 500 and 1000 ppm oil declined during the time by around 426 and 382 l m2 h respectively this can be explained by formation of cake layer on membrane surface increasing membrane resistance against permeability and consequently causing membrane fouling 33 it was also observed that average fluxes in the case of tio2 γ al2o3 modified ceramic membrane were about 1177 and 1088 l m2 h for filtration of 500 and 1000 ppm oil respectively fig 8 which were remarkably higher in comparison with the average fluxes of 737 and 680 l m2 h for the γ al2o3 coated ceramic membrane fig 7 this is because of the presence of strongly hydrophilic tio2 nanoparticles which positively affect membrane permeability 36 3 3 2 effect of tmp in order to assess the impact of tmp on permeate flux and toc removal experiments were carried out under various applied tmps through filtration of synthetic oily wastewater it was observed that with increasing applied tmp in the range of 0 5 2 bar in the case of 500 ppm oil permeate flux of both the γ al2o3 coated and tio2 γ al2o3 modified ceramic membranes increased remarkably by about 660 and 1030 l m2 h respectively additionally when 1000 ppm oil was used permeate fluxes rose by around 550 and 830 l m2 h for the γ al2o3 coated and tio2 γ al2o3 modified ceramic membranes respectively fig 9 however it was found that the higher the tmp was 1 5 bar the more dense cake layer was concurrently formed on the membrane surface slightly decreasing the permeate flux of all membranes in the case of both of 500 and 1000 ppm oil as feed this is due to the fact that higher tmps lead to higher flow rates bringing about inevitable membrane fouling so there is a critical tmp under which tmp increases more rapid than membrane resistance against permeability compared to tmps above the critical pressure 1 5 bar in this research 41 42 additionally the permeability of the tio2 γ al2o3 modified ceramic membrane was found to be considerably higher compared to the γ al2o3 coated ceramic membrane as discussed earlier this is because of the strong hydrophilicity of tio2 nanoparticles 36 moreover the impact of applied tmp on toc removal efficiency of the tio2 γ al2o3 modified ceramic membrane was investigated it was found that as the tmp increased from 0 5 to 1 5 bar the amount of toc in permeate stream considerably decreased which resulted in the enhanced toc removal efficiency peaking at 98 and 92 in the case of 500 and 1000 ppm oil respectively fig 10 on the contrary under the applied tmps higher than 1 5 bar toc removal efficiencies drastically decreased to a low of 83 and 79 8 for filtration of 500 and 1000 ppm oil respectively this phenomenon can be explained by the gel polarization model whereby if tmp and subsequently flow rate are both high enough feed stream will quickly pass through membrane pores consequently oil droplets are highly likely distorted and cause oil compaction developing a gel layer on membrane surface and adversely affecting toc removal efficiency 42 3 3 3 effect of photocatalyst the effect of tio2 photocatalysts on permeability and toc removal was evaluated through filtration of synthetic oily wastewater by the γ al2o3 coated and tio2 γ al2o3 modified ceramic membranes it was found that the average permeate flux of the tio2 γ al2o3 modified ceramic membrane for filtration of 500 and 1000 ppm oil was about 883 and 779 l m2 h respectively while the average permeate flux of the γ al2o3 coated ceramic membrane was significantly lower nearly 612 and 562 l m2 h for 500 and 1000 ppm oil respectively fig 11 this is due to the great influence of photoinduced hydrophilicity characteristics of tio2 photocatalysts 36 it was also observed that while the permeate flux of the tio2 γ al2o3 modified ceramic membrane substantially decreased by around 400 and 350 l m2 h in the case of 500 and 1000 ppm oil respectively the figures for the γ al2o3 coated ceramic membrane decreased by nearly 250 and 210 l m2 h respectively at the end of the experiments the difference between the drop in the permeate fluxes of the γ al2o3 coated and tio2 γ al2o3 modified ceramic membranes can be explained by the agglomeration of tio2 photocatalysts on membrane surface deteriorating membrane permeability 36 however as mentioned earlier the tio2 γ al2o3 modified ceramic membrane showed better permeability for filtration of 500 and 1000 ppm oil compared to the γ al2o3 coated ceramic membrane this is mainly because of the presence of superhydrophilic tio2 photocatalysts present on membrane surface 36 furthermore it was observed that in the case of 500 ppm oil as feed toc removal efficiencies above 97 were achieved through filtration by the tio2 γ al2o3 modified ceramic membrane under uv irradiation which were significantly higher compared to the removal efficiencies below 92 achieved by the γ al2o3 coated ceramic membrane fig 12 this is because of the fact that tio2 photocatalysts play a key role in degrading a wide variety of organic substances such as toc furthermore a potential explanation for the effective removal of toc can be the production of strong oxidants by tio2 nanoparticles under uv lamp irradiation oxidizing a great deal of organic substances present in wastewater 36 on the contrary when 1000 ppm oil was used as feed toc removal efficiencies of the γ al2o3 coated and tio2 γ al2o3 modified ceramic membranes were considerably lower below 89 and 96 respectively this is because of the fact that the higher the concentration of feed is the thicker the formed oil layer will be as a consequence of this uv light cannot diffuse into the formed gel layer or reach photocatalyst particles present on membrane surface bringing about less accessible areas suitable for uv illumination thus photodegradation will inevitably decrease 43 44 3 3 4 effect of flow rate different flow rates ranging from 10 8 45 ml min were applied to assess their impact on membrane resistance against permeability it was observed that with increasing flow rates permeate flux of the tio2 γ al2o3 modified ceramic membrane for filtration of 500 and 1000 ppm oil notably increased by about 995 and 940 l m2 h respectively while the figures for the γ al2o3 coated ceramic membrane rose by 615 and 605 l m2 h respectively fig 13 however even though higher permeate fluxes were expected at high flow rates the permeate flux of both of the membranes started becoming slower at flow rates above 32 16 ml min this can be explained by concentration polarization which takes place at high flow rates bringing about membrane fouling in other words this happens whenever oil particles are highly rejected by membrane at a high flow rate which results in forming a dense cake layer and consequently increasing the membrane resistance against permeability therefore permeability at high flow rates above 32 16 ml min in this research increases slower than lower flow rates 41 42 it was also observed that the permeability of the tio2 γ al2o3 modified ceramic membrane was remarkably higher compared to the γ al2o3 coated ceramic membrane this can be explained by the strong photoinduced hydrophilicity of tio2 nanoparticles which positively affects membrane permeability 36 3 3 5 effect of feed concentration the effect of feed concentration on permeability and toc removal efficiency was evaluated through filtration of 500 and 1000 ppm oil as feed it was found that the higher the concentration of oil was the more the permeate flux decreased during the filtration process by both of the γ al2o3 coated and tio2 γ al2o3 modified ceramic membranes fig 14 as the obtained data indicated the average permeate flux of the tio2 γ al2o3 modified and γ al2o3 coated ceramic membranes in the case of 500 ppm oil were around 1053 118 and 706 238 l m2 h respectively which were higher compared to the average permeate fluxes of 966 474 and 636 634 l m2 h in the case of 1000 ppm oil in other words within 60 min of 500 ppm oil treatment by the tio2 γ al2o3 modified and γ al2o3 coated ceramic membranes nearly 30 and 24 of permeate fluxes dropped respectively during the time while the figures for 1000 ppm oil were around 36 and 33 this is mainly because of the fact that feed with high concentration tends to not only negatively affect the applied tmp but also forms more dense oil layer on membrane surface resulting in a higher resistance against feed sample passage through membrane pores however lower feed concentrations highly unlikely form dense cake layer on membrane surface which results in a high permeate flux therefore permeate flux and its quality significantly decrease when high concentration feed is used 42 additionally as discussed previously due to photoinduced hydrophilicity of tio2 nanoparticles permeate flux of the tio2 γ al2o3 modified ceramic membrane was remarkably higher than the γ al2o3 coated ceramic membrane in the case of both of 500 and 1000 ppm oil 36 moreover according to the obtained experimental data table 1 toc removal of the tio2 γ al2o3 modified ceramic membrane upon uv illumination was highly efficient 97 in the case of 500 ppm oil as feed which contained initial toc concentration of 500 ppm this is because of the fact that more dense oil layer is formed on membrane surface at higher concentrations of feed preventing uv light from either diffusing into the cake layer or reaching tio2 photocatalysts on membrane surface thus the available areas appropriate for uv light diffusion will reduce causing instantaneous decline of toc photodegradation in addition it was observed that even though the toc removal increased with increasing flow rate toc removal at higher flow rates 32 16 ml min decreased significantly a possible explanation can be concentration polarization which brings about membrane fouling so there was an optimum range of flow rate for toc removal in this experiment 41 42 4 conclusion a pmr system equipped with tio2 γ al2o3 modified ceramic membrane was employed for synthetic oily wastewater treatment and produced desirable results in terms of high permeate flux and excellent toc removal efficiency obtained experimental results indicated that tio2 γ al2o3 modified ceramic membrane could successfully achieve high toc removal efficiency under uv irradiation in addition the impact of influencing operating parameters including flow rate transmembrane pressure tmp tio2 photocatalysts and feed oil concentration on permeate flux and toc removal on the pmr system were evaluated it was identified that the application of high tmps 1 5 bar as well as high flow rates 32 16 ml min negatively impacted on both permeate flux and toc removal efficiency during the experiments this can be explained by gel layer formation on membrane surface toc removal efficiencies above 90 were attained under the applied 1 5 bar tmp and flow rate of 32 16 ml min for filtration of 500 and 1000 ppm oil as feed ultimately quite apart from provision of practical information in terms of efficient removal of organics in the oily wastewater followed by an acceptable flux this experimental project promotes the application of this pmr system to an industrial scale

permeability and selectivity 13 15 membranes are made of various materials including organics i e polymeric membranes and inorganics i e ceramic membranes long et al 2018 fabricated superwettable coprinus comatus cc coated pvdf membrane through vacuum filtration for separation of oil water emulsions this integrated system could still achieve excellent separation efficiencies 99 after 6 cycles 16 in another study carried out by wang et al 2019 a novel loess coated pvdf membrane was prepared through deposition of the loess and sodium alginate suspension onto the membrane surface with a vacuum pump for oil in water emulsion separation it was found that the modified membrane showed a great potential in terms of separation efficiencies around 99 6 even after 10 cycles and permeate flux of 910 4 l m2 h bar 17 inorganic membranes particularly ceramic membranes have generally proved their superiority over polymeric membranes for industrial use due to their superior qualities such as higher selectivity noticeable permeation rate remarkable chemical and thermal stability ease of membrane recovery through calcination or backward stream of water and noteworthy longevity 18 19 additionally while bacteria bring about bio fouling degradation in the case of polymeric membranes it is found that ceramic membranes are highly unlikely damaged by bacteria 20 the primary purpose of a pmr system is to take full advantage of both photocatalysis and membrane separation process simultaneously enabling the system to not only separate a broad range of pollutants via membrane filtration process which can exploit its potential as a selective barrier for some substances to be degraded and a barrier for photocatalyst but also to degrade various organic compounds present in effluents into non toxic inorganic molecules through photocatalytic activities under uv irradiation 15 21 tio2 nanoparticles well known as photocatalysts are widely used in experimental studies owing to their thermal and physical strength reasonable price and outstanding photocatalytic and anti fouling features 22 23 forming active oxidants such as hydroxyl radicals tio2 photocatalysts play a key role in not only photocatalysis in aops but also in degradation and decomposition of contaminants to less harmful substances 15 there are some relevant researches which were recently carried out to investigate the efficiency of pmrs for instance horovitz et al 2018 reported an extremely effective pmr equipped with n doped tio2 coated microfiltration mf al2o3 membrane for removal of ms2 virus with regard to the importance of ms2 bacteriophage interaction with the pmr for photocatalytic and non photocatalytic virus inactivation 24 in another experiment conducted by rani and karthikeyan 2018 an integrated slurry pmr consisted of polyethersulphone pes membrane and tio2 photocatalysts was prepared which not only reached 97 of phenanthrene phe photodegradation and 79 of toc removal efficiency but also could efficiently reuse tio2 25 moreover ahmad et al 2019 prepared a photocatalytic ceramic membrane which was modified through direct growth of tio2 nanostructures on a al2o3 membrane resulting in superior membrane performance with enhanced anti fouling properties and efficient organic removal 26 additionally qilong et al 2019 reported a well designed ceramic based submerged pmr combined with suspended tio2 photocatalysts which achieved a successful treatment of refractory antibiotic organic compounds 27 the present research proposes to inspect the performance of a pmr consisted of γ al2o3 coated ceramic membrane with immobilized tio2 photocatalysts on its surface for treatment of synthetic oily wastewater upon uv irradiation in this integrated system γ al2o3 coated ceramic membrane played a dual role as a support for tio2 photocatalysts and a physical selective barrier for rejected substances the main focus of this research is to evaluate the performance of the pmr system under uv irradiation in terms of permeate flux and toc removal under the influence of major parameters including flow rate tmp tio2 photocatalysts and feed oil concentration 2 experimental 2 1 preparation of thin films in order to prepare γ al2o3 thin film aluminium tri sec butylate c2h5ch ch3 o 3al was hydrolyzed in distilled water at temperature of 80 c molar ratio water astb 100 and the white hastened boehmite began to stir well for 30 min 0 12 mol of nitric acid per mole of aluminium was then added which caused an aqueous hno3 solution 1 5 mol l as a result of this the boehmite suspension was guided towards peptization which produced a stable sol the polyvinyl alcohol pva 12 wt in aqueous solution was added to the sol suspension in the final stage because of the viscosity adjustment 28 additionally in order to form tio2 thin film three merck made chemicals were employed including titanium tetraisopropoxide ttip as the source of tio2 high purity 99 5 ethanol as solvent and 65 nitric acid with molar ratios of 1 34 0 35 respectively 29 30 after dissolution of ttip in ethanol under 15 min of agitation gradual addition of nitric acid while stirring for extra 2 h resulted a transparent light yellow color tio2 sol 30 32 2 2 preparation of ceramic membranes the disc shaped ultrafiltration uf ceramic membranes were used with thickness and diameter of 2 mm and 3 cm respectively which were prepared by research institute of petroleum industry ripi through dry pressing under the conditions of operating pressure and firing temperature of 415 mpa and 1500 c respectively with 2 h soaking time the γ al2o3 thin films were then prepared through deposition of colloidal boehmite sol obtained from sol gel method during 30 min of dip coating coatings were performed on only one side of the ceramic membranes in the next stage the γ al2o3 coated ceramic membranes were fired at a temperature of 110 c followed by heating the gel layer at 500 c for 2 h with heating rate of 2 c min for calcination purposes 33 moreover the top layer of some of γ al2o3 coated ceramic membranes were modified through deposition of tio2 sol obtained from sol gel method on the same side of γ al2o3 thin films for about 30 min of dip coating then the tio2 γ al2o3 modified ceramic membranes were heat treated at room temperature for 24 h and eventually they were fired at temperature of 450 c for 2 h with heating rate of 2 c min ultimately in order to conduct a comparative analysis experiments were conducted by using both of the γ al2o3 coated and tio2 γ al2o3 modified ceramic membranes 2 3 pmr fabrication and experimental procedure the filtration processes were operated in dead end mode fig 1 in order to carry out operations a pmr system was employed in batch mode the system consisted of a cylindrical membrane module with the dimensions 13 3 cm h 7 5 cm d in which the disc shaped ceramic membrane with effective surface area of 3 302 cm2 was placed in addition a uv lamp with a maximum light intensity output at 254 nm model g4 t5 4 w philips co holland was installed between the inner and outer walls of the membrane module a feed tank containing a magnet inside with approximate capacity of 4 l was positioned on a stirrer to constantly keep the feed in a certain concentration the feed tank was directly linked to both the membrane module and a nitrogen gas tank the synthetic oily wastewater was transferred from the feed tank to the membrane module under the pressure force provided by the gas tank the permeate samples were gathered in a vessel sited under the membrane module and the content of vessel was permanently measured as a function of time by using a digital balance model and ek 600i tmps and flow rates were applied in the range of 0 5 2 bar and 10 8 51 7 ml min respectively during the experiments each experiment was carried out for 1 h at room temperature 2 4 structural characterization of modified ceramic membranes in order to characterize the morphology and structure of the γ al2o3 coated and tio2 γ al2o3 modified ceramic membranes sem images of the top surface and cross section of modified membranes provided by a scanning electron microscope model tescon vega co were analyzed in order to analyze the phase composition of the tio2 modified layer of γ al2o3 coated ceramic membranes xrd patterns were provided by a bruker d4 diffractometer germany with cu kα radiation of λ 1 54060 a and a step size of 0 02 in the 2θ ranged from 20 to 70 to determine the kinetic of organics photoreaction on membrane surface the langmuir hinshelwood equation eq 1 was used in this equation the degradation rate r mg l min is linked to the concentration of organic compound c mg l 34 1 r dc dt k r k ad c 1 k ad c where k r represents the intrinsic rate constant mg l min and k ad is the adsorption equilibrium constant l mg it is worth mentioning that if the adsorption is not strong sufficiently and or the amount of organic compound is not high the langmuir hinshelwood equation is shortened to a first order equation eq 2 35 2 ln c c 0 k r k ad t k app t in which t is the reaction time c represents concentration at time t c 0 indicates the initial concentration and k app is the overall degradation rate constant 1 min plotting ln c c 0 versus reaction time t results in a straight line whereby the slope determines the k app in order to evaluate the photocatalytic activity of tio2 photocatalysts that were deposited on the top layer of γ al2o3 coated ceramic membrane 5 ppm methylene blue mb was prepared the solution was magnetically blended for about 30 min under dark conditions for adsorption desorption equilibrium purposes in the next stage uv illumination became involved and samples were gathered at 15 minute intervals between 0 and 90 min in order to determine the photodegradation efficiencies absorption spectra of mb samples were achieved by a uv vis spectrophotometer model jasco v 670 in the wavelength range of 400 800 nm 2 5 analytical methods in order to calculate the permeate flux of treated oily wastewater permeates were measured at regular intervals during the operations with regard to the effective surface area of 3 302 cm2 in general permeate flux is calculated as below eq 3 36 3 j q a t in which q represents the volume of permeate l a indicates the surface area of membrane m2 and t is permeate time in addition the amount of toc present in feed and permeate samples was evaluated by using a toc analyzer model rosemount analytical dc 190 america toc removal efficiency is calculated as below eq 4 36 4 t o c r e m o v a l e f f i c i e n c y 1 c p c t 100 where c p and c t represent the toc concentration in permeate and feed respectively 2 5 1 preparation of synthetic oily wastewater the synthetic oily wastewater as the sample feed was prepared by using oil in two different concentrations of 500 and 1000 ppm 0 5 and 1 g of oil were separately added to 1000 ml of distilled water each of which was then combined with 0 075 and 0 08 g of the surfactant polyoxyethylene sorbitan trioleate tween 85 respectively stable emulsions were prepared by using a mixer model heidolph rzr at 800 rpm for 15 min 3 results and discussion 3 1 morphology and structural characterization in order to analyze the morphology and characteristics of the γ al2o3 coated and tio2 γ al2o3 modified ceramic membranes sem images were provided figs 2 and 3 it was observed that pores became intrinsically narrow and well organized as well due to the deposition of tio2 layer it was also shown that the tio2 particles were coated densely and homogeneously reducing the mean pore size of the membrane fig 3 however we could not present the percentage of the reduced mean pore size the characteristic peaks of the crystal planes of anatase and rutile were confirmed by the xrd image related to the tio2 layer of the γ al2o3 coated ceramic membrane after being annealed at temperature of 450 c fig 4 jcpds card no 21 1272 and jcpds card no 21 1276 the existence of both anatase and rutile phases was confirmed and it was observed that anatase was the major phase of the xrd spectrum additionally the obtained results from other studies showed that synthesized anatase tio2 nanoparticles showed better photocatalytic activity compared to rutile phase 37 40 with regard to its higher crystallinity anatase is more appropriate for photocatalysis because of the fact that the higher the crystallinity is the less defects as recombination sites between photogenerated electrons and holes are offered 38 thus it was confirmed that the tio2 γ al2o3 modified ceramic membranes predominantly included anatase phase enabling them to have high photocatalytic activity 3 2 photocatalytic activity measurement as mentioned previously the photocatalytic activity of the tio2 γ al2o3 modified ceramic membrane was investigated in a batch study according to the eq 2 with the data obtained from the analysis of the samples by uv vis spectrophotometer fig 5 it was found that the amount of absorbance reduced during the time confirming the acceptable photodegradation rate of mb under uv irradiation by the tio2 γ al2o3 modified ceramic membrane so by plotting ln c c 0 versus reaction time t the k app could be easily found for each sample through the slope of each line fig 6 it is worth mentioning that k app is widely known as a criterion for evaluating the membrane photocatalytic activity it was observed that the tio2 photocatalysts showed an increasing photocatalytic activity upon uv illumination during the time a reasonable explanation can be offered by the strong oxidants generated by tio2 photocatalysts under uv irradiation oxidizing a great deal of organics 36 3 3 filtration tests 3 3 1 pure water and oily wastewater permeate flux measurement membrane permeability dependence on the type of feed was evaluated through filtration of synthetic oily wastewater and distilled water as distinct types of feed it was observed that the permeate flux of distilled water for both of the γ al2o3 coated and tio2 γ al2o3 modified ceramic membranes remained constant over the whole period shown nearly about 5580 and 7340 l m2 h respectively figs 7 and 8 however when oil with 500 and 1000 ppm concentration was used as feed the permeate fluxes of both of the membranes were significantly lower compared to the permeation of distilled water while in the case of γ al2o3 coated ceramic membrane permeate flux steadily decreased during the time by about 214 and 269 l m2 h for filtration of 500 and 1000 ppm oil respectively permeate flux of the tio2 γ al2o3 modified ceramic membrane for 500 and 1000 ppm oil declined during the time by around 426 and 382 l m2 h respectively this can be explained by formation of cake layer on membrane surface increasing membrane resistance against permeability and consequently causing membrane fouling 33 it was also observed that average fluxes in the case of tio2 γ al2o3 modified ceramic membrane were about 1177 and 1088 l m2 h for filtration of 500 and 1000 ppm oil respectively fig 8 which were remarkably higher in comparison with the average fluxes of 737 and 680 l m2 h for the γ al2o3 coated ceramic membrane fig 7 this is because of the presence of strongly hydrophilic tio2 nanoparticles which positively affect membrane permeability 36 3 3 2 effect of tmp in order to assess the impact of tmp on permeate flux and toc removal experiments were carried out under various applied tmps through filtration of synthetic oily wastewater it was observed that with increasing applied tmp in the range of 0 5 2 bar in the case of 500 ppm oil permeate flux of both the γ al2o3 coated and tio2 γ al2o3 modified ceramic membranes increased remarkably by about 660 and 1030 l m2 h respectively additionally when 1000 ppm oil was used permeate fluxes rose by around 550 and 830 l m2 h for the γ al2o3 coated and tio2 γ al2o3 modified ceramic membranes respectively fig 9 however it was found that the higher the tmp was 1 5 bar the more dense cake layer was concurrently formed on the membrane surface slightly decreasing the permeate flux of all membranes in the case of both of 500 and 1000 ppm oil as feed this is due to the fact that higher tmps lead to higher flow rates bringing about inevitable membrane fouling so there is a critical tmp under which tmp increases more rapid than membrane resistance against permeability compared to tmps above the critical pressure 1 5 bar in this research 41 42 additionally the permeability of the tio2 γ al2o3 modified ceramic membrane was found to be considerably higher compared to the γ al2o3 coated ceramic membrane as discussed earlier this is because of the strong hydrophilicity of tio2 nanoparticles 36 moreover the impact of applied tmp on toc removal efficiency of the tio2 γ al2o3 modified ceramic membrane was investigated it was found that as the tmp increased from 0 5 to 1 5 bar the amount of toc in permeate stream considerably decreased which resulted in the enhanced toc removal efficiency peaking at 98 and 92 in the case of 500 and 1000 ppm oil respectively fig 10 on the contrary under the applied tmps higher than 1 5 bar toc removal efficiencies drastically decreased to a low of 83 and 79 8 for filtration of 500 and 1000 ppm oil respectively this phenomenon can be explained by the gel polarization model whereby if tmp and subsequently flow rate are both high enough feed stream will quickly pass through membrane pores consequently oil droplets are highly likely distorted and cause oil compaction developing a gel layer on membrane surface and adversely affecting toc removal efficiency 42 3 3 3 effect of photocatalyst the effect of tio2 photocatalysts on permeability and toc removal was evaluated through filtration of synthetic oily wastewater by the γ al2o3 coated and tio2 γ al2o3 modified ceramic membranes it was found that the average permeate flux of the tio2 γ al2o3 modified ceramic membrane for filtration of 500 and 1000 ppm oil was about 883 and 779 l m2 h respectively while the average permeate flux of the γ al2o3 coated ceramic membrane was significantly lower nearly 612 and 562 l m2 h for 500 and 1000 ppm oil respectively fig 11 this is due to the great influence of photoinduced hydrophilicity characteristics of tio2 photocatalysts 36 it was also observed that while the permeate flux of the tio2 γ al2o3 modified ceramic membrane substantially decreased by around 400 and 350 l m2 h in the case of 500 and 1000 ppm oil respectively the figures for the γ al2o3 coated ceramic membrane decreased by nearly 250 and 210 l m2 h respectively at the end of the experiments the difference between the drop in the permeate fluxes of the γ al2o3 coated and tio2 γ al2o3 modified ceramic membranes can be explained by the agglomeration of tio2 photocatalysts on membrane surface deteriorating membrane permeability 36 however as mentioned earlier the tio2 γ al2o3 modified ceramic membrane showed better permeability for filtration of 500 and 1000 ppm oil compared to the γ al2o3 coated ceramic membrane this is mainly because of the presence of superhydrophilic tio2 photocatalysts present on membrane surface 36 furthermore it was observed that in the case of 500 ppm oil as feed toc removal efficiencies above 97 were achieved through filtration by the tio2 γ al2o3 modified ceramic membrane under uv irradiation which were significantly higher compared to the removal efficiencies below 92 achieved by the γ al2o3 coated ceramic membrane fig 12 this is because of the fact that tio2 photocatalysts play a key role in degrading a wide variety of organic substances such as toc furthermore a potential explanation for the effective removal of toc can be the production of strong oxidants by tio2 nanoparticles under uv lamp irradiation oxidizing a great deal of organic substances present in wastewater 36 on the contrary when 1000 ppm oil was used as feed toc removal efficiencies of the γ al2o3 coated and tio2 γ al2o3 modified ceramic membranes were considerably lower below 89 and 96 respectively this is because of the fact that the higher the concentration of feed is the thicker the formed oil layer will be as a consequence of this uv light cannot diffuse into the formed gel layer or reach photocatalyst particles present on membrane surface bringing about less accessible areas suitable for uv illumination thus photodegradation will inevitably decrease 43 44 3 3 4 effect of flow rate different flow rates ranging from 10 8 45 ml min were applied to assess their impact on membrane resistance against permeability it was observed that with increasing flow rates permeate flux of the tio2 γ al2o3 modified ceramic membrane for filtration of 500 and 1000 ppm oil notably increased by about 995 and 940 l m2 h respectively while the figures for the γ al2o3 coated ceramic membrane rose by 615 and 605 l m2 h respectively fig 13 however even though higher permeate fluxes were expected at high flow rates the permeate flux of both of the membranes started becoming slower at flow rates above 32 16 ml min this can be explained by concentration polarization which takes place at high flow rates bringing about membrane fouling in other words this happens whenever oil particles are highly rejected by membrane at a high flow rate which results in forming a dense cake layer and consequently increasing the membrane resistance against permeability therefore permeability at high flow rates above 32 16 ml min in this research increases slower than lower flow rates 41 42 it was also observed that the permeability of the tio2 γ al2o3 modified ceramic membrane was remarkably higher compared to the γ al2o3 coated ceramic membrane this can be explained by the strong photoinduced hydrophilicity of tio2 nanoparticles which positively affects membrane permeability 36 3 3 5 effect of feed concentration the effect of feed concentration on permeability and toc removal efficiency was evaluated through filtration of 500 and 1000 ppm oil as feed it was found that the higher the concentration of oil was the more the permeate flux decreased during the filtration process by both of the γ al2o3 coated and tio2 γ al2o3 modified ceramic membranes fig 14 as the obtained data indicated the average permeate flux of the tio2 γ al2o3 modified and γ al2o3 coated ceramic membranes in the case of 500 ppm oil were around 1053 118 and 706 238 l m2 h respectively which were higher compared to the average permeate fluxes of 966 474 and 636 634 l m2 h in the case of 1000 ppm oil in other words within 60 min of 500 ppm oil treatment by the tio2 γ al2o3 modified and γ al2o3 coated ceramic membranes nearly 30 and 24 of permeate fluxes dropped respectively during the time while the figures for 1000 ppm oil were around 36 and 33 this is mainly because of the fact that feed with high concentration tends to not only negatively affect the applied tmp but also forms more dense oil layer on membrane surface resulting in a higher resistance against feed sample passage through membrane pores however lower feed concentrations highly unlikely form dense cake layer on membrane surface which results in a high permeate flux therefore permeate flux and its quality significantly decrease when high concentration feed is used 42 additionally as discussed previously due to photoinduced hydrophilicity of tio2 nanoparticles permeate flux of the tio2 γ al2o3 modified ceramic membrane was remarkably higher than the γ al2o3 coated ceramic membrane in the case of both of 500 and 1000 ppm oil 36 moreover according to the obtained experimental data table 1 toc removal of the tio2 γ al2o3 modified ceramic membrane upon uv illumination was highly efficient 97 in the case of 500 ppm oil as feed which contained initial toc concentration of 500 ppm this is because of the fact that more dense oil layer is formed on membrane surface at higher concentrations of feed preventing uv light from either diffusing into the cake layer or reaching tio2 photocatalysts on membrane surface thus the available areas appropriate for uv light diffusion will reduce causing instantaneous decline of toc photodegradation in addition it was observed that even though the toc removal increased with increasing flow rate toc removal at higher flow rates 32 16 ml min decreased significantly a possible explanation can be concentration polarization which brings about membrane fouling so there was an optimum range of flow rate for toc removal in this experiment 41 42 4 conclusion a pmr system equipped with tio2 γ al2o3 modified ceramic membrane was employed for synthetic oily wastewater treatment and produced desirable results in terms of high permeate flux and excellent toc removal efficiency obtained experimental results indicated that tio2 γ al2o3 modified ceramic membrane could successfully achieve high toc removal efficiency under uv irradiation in addition the impact of influencing operating parameters including flow rate transmembrane pressure tmp tio2 photocatalysts and feed oil concentration on permeate flux and toc removal on the pmr system were evaluated it was identified that the application of high tmps 1 5 bar as well as high flow rates 32 16 ml min negatively impacted on both permeate flux and toc removal efficiency during the experiments this can be explained by gel layer formation on membrane surface toc removal efficiencies above 90 were attained under the applied 1 5 bar tmp and flow rate of 32 16 ml min for filtration of 500 and 1000 ppm oil as feed ultimately quite apart from provision of practical information in terms of efficient removal of organics in the oily wastewater followed by an acceptable flux this experimental project promotes the application of this pmr system to an industrial scale

13944,conventional wastewater treatment systems demand a high cost mechanical aeration using algal bacterial systems helps to reach a cost efficient treatment method by eliminating mechanical aeration since algae produce the oxygen needed for treatment process in this study two groups of experiments were performed for domestic wastewater treatment processes for the first group semi continuous microalgae bacterial photo bioreactors were cultivated chlorella vulgaris and activated sludge as were used as microalgae and bacterial inoculums respectively the effect of different algae and as ratios on the chemical oxygen demand cod n nh4 and p po4 3 removal was studied the removal efficiency of cod was above 93 for the three tested algae and as inoculum ratios 5 1 1 1 and 1 5 the reactor with algae as inoculum ratio of 5 1 achieved the highest final n nh4 and p po4 3 removal efficiencies 88 0 1 0 and 84 0 1 0 respectively furthermore the highest biomass concentration 1 96 g l 1 from initial amount of 0 3 g l 1 was observed in the reactor with algae as ratio of 5 1 the ratio of 5 1 algae as was found as the optimum ratio which promoted the cooperation between microalgae and as for nutrient removal for the second group of experiments the optimum ratio of 5 1 algae as was used in a membrane bioreactor and the results showed that this reactor enhanced the final removal efficacies from 88 to 98 and from 84 to 89 for n nh4 and p po4 3 respectively keywords algal bacterial culture membrane bioreactor microalgae photo bioreactor wastewater treatment 1 introduction biological methods in wastewater treatment are preferred due to be more cost efficient and environmentally friendly 1 4 the use of microalgae bacterial systems for both domestic and industrial wastewater treatments has received a great deal of attention in recent years 5 they are more commonly used as an alternative bio system mostly in tropical and subtropical regions 1 6 7 conventional wastewater treatment systems based on as demand a high cost mechanical aeration therefore introducing a more cost effective method seems to be essential using algal bacterial systems helps to reach a cost efficient treatment method by eliminating mechanical aeration under illumination algae assimilate the nutrients nh4 no3 and po4 3 available in the wastewater and simultaneously produce oxygen by photosynthesis needed for heterotrophic bacteria to mineralize organic materials in return they utilize the carbon dioxide released from bacterial respiration to complete photosynthetic cycle thereby reducing the emission of greenhouse gases these systems establish a cheaper alternative to mechanical aeration 8 12 eisenberg et al 13 estimated energy savings of more than 50 for an algal bacterial system compared to a conventional wastewater treatment process chlorella and scenedesmus are unicellular green algae which are widely used in wastewater treatment 14 microalgae can grow under autotrophic with inorganic carbon source and continuous light heterotrophic inorganic carbon source and without light and mixotrophic both organic and inorganic sources and without continuous light growth conditions 13 15 municipal wastewater is a proper source of nitrogen phosphorous and other elements e g cu mn ca fe k s which makes it a great medium for microalgae s growth 11 16 in microalgae based wastewater treatment systems the functions of microalgae include absorption of hazardous heavy metals o2 supply and nutrient uptake 12 17 19 furthermore algae photosynthesis increases the ph and the amount of dissolved oxygen do which results in indirect disinfection without appropriate treatment extra amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus in discharged wastewater cause downstream eutrophication and damage the ecosystem 19 although there are chemical and physical treatment technologies they consume a large amount of energy during the removal process 20 chemical treatment methods are not only costly processes but can also lead to secondary contamination of sludge byproduct however compared with chemical and physical processes nutrients can be removed in a cheaper and safer way by using algae based systems 17 18 21 22 accumulation of nitrogen and phosphorus into algal and bacterial biomass increases in the case of using algal bacterial system only 26 n nh4 was assimilated into biomass during the use of bacterial system in order to treat 1 g acetonitrile however using algal bacterial culture led to assimilation of 54 n nh4 into biomass under the same condition 10 23 the initial inoculum ratios of algae and bacteria may affect the symbiosis of algae and bacteria and then result in different nutrient removal efficiencies 24 25 guieysse et al 12 showed that the initial inoculation ratio of chlorella sorokiniana and ralstonia basilensis has a significant impact on the salicylate degradation efficiency in closed systems as has higher organic nutrient removal ability than the normal bacteria included in municipal wastewater therefore as can be used as bacterial inoculum in algal bacterial based domestic wastewater treatment systems to promote the nutrient removal efficiencies 24 continuous microalgae cultivation in wastewater for nutrient removal and biomass production for biofuel has been carried out in both photobioreactors and open ponds 26 28 one of the biggest concerns of these systems is washout problems membrane bioreactors mbr can address this problem by membrane filtration 26 mbr have been widely used recently because of their advantage of high sludge concentration small footprint and high effluent quality 25 however high concentrations of mixed liquor suspended solids mlss would increase the non newtonian viscosities which can increase the aeration energy consumption therefore it is needed to develop an efficient technique to reduce membrane fouling and decrease aeration cost in the mbr system there are some studies on combining algae system with mbr to remove n and p in wastewater 29 30 however most of these studies used external co2 supply because of the absence of sludge bacteria and resulted in slow nutrient removal efficiency of only algae 25 31 furthermore algae cells when using membrane filtration cause dramatically fouling 32 previous researches have been shown that combining algae activated sludge and mbr decreases the aeration consumption and the membrane fouling 25 33 many studies have achieved an excellent performance for different algae sludge inoculation ratios in batch mode ruiz martin et al 34 showed that semi continuous algal systems achieved higher removal efficiencies than batch cultures however the nutrient removal performance of semi continuous algal bacterial systems as well as the effect of algae sludge inoculation ratio in these reactors is still unknown therefore the first objective of this work is to find the optimum ratio of algae and as in semi continuous system to obtain the highest nutrient removal efficiencies second the optimum ratio is used in an algal as mbr to enhance the removal efficiencies during this research the experiments were conducted in 2 groups the first group of experiments was operated in semi continuous algal bacterial photo bioreactors without mechanical aeration five different ratios of algae and as were used to find the optimum ratio that enhances the cooperation between microalgae and as for the removal of cod ammonium and phosphorous from municipal wastewater for the second group of the experiments the optimum ratio of algae and activated sludge obtained from the first group of experiments was used in a membrane bioreactor to enhance the removal efficiencies 2 material and methods 2 1 microorganisms the algae inoculum chlorella vulgaris was obtained through the research institute of applied science tehran iran microalgae were pre cultivated photo autotrophically in sterile n 8 medium at ambient temperature and were continuously illuminated by fluorescent lamps under light intensity of 2000 lx the aerobic as was obtained from an as reactor in the ekbatan municipal wastewater treatment plant in tehran iran for adaptation both microalgae and as were fed with synthetic municipal wastewater using synthetic medium not only simplifies the use for initial laboratory based experiments but also makes it easy to analyze major components without considering unknown variables such as biotic variables 35 2 2 experimental operation the first group of the experiments was carried out in semi continuous culture in stirred cylindrical glass reactors with working volume of 650 ml for 21 days for this study semi continuous experiments were conducted with a fixed hydraulic retention time hrt of 7 days in all runs which was maintained by feeding 93 ml of feedstock and removing 93 ml of effluent daily an hrt between 7 and 10 days and room temperature are found to be the optimum operating condition for microalgae bacterial systems 8 five different mass ratios of algae and as inoculum were considered the features of the reactors are shown in the table 1 the reactors were operated in the same condition and ambient temperature around 25 c and were illuminated by fluorescent lamps with a light density of 2000 lx under a photoperiod of 12 12 h light dark the initial biomass concentration was chosen as 0 3 g l 1 according to the algal biomass concentration in common microalgal wastewater treatment processes magnetic stirrers were used as mixers with a mixing velocity of 300 rpm to avoid light limitation the sedimentation of biomass and nutrient gradients therefore the photo bioreactors can be considered as completely mixed reactors the velocity of 300 rpm was chosen due to its higher nutrient removal efficiency as well as higher algae growth rate 9 the second part of the experiments was performed in a cylindrical submerged membrane bioreactor with a working volume of 2 5 l using the optimum ratio obtained from the first group of the experiments supplementary fig s1 27 a circle membrane module with a hydrophilic millipore mixed cellulose ester mce with a pore size of 0 2 μm was used the module

was fed continuously with the synthetic wastewater and the feed flow rate was controlled by a level controller the reactor was illuminated with three cool light fluorescent lamps with a total intensity of 6000 lx which was fixed around and outside the cylinder the reactor was operated under room temperature of 25 c synthetic municipal wastewater was used as feed for all the reactors

reactors by ph meter probe 240 istek korea do was measured using a do sensor wtw340i germany for further analysis such as cod phosphate ammonium and biomass concentration the samples of 20 ml were collected every 24 h 20 ml feed was added to each reactor to compensate for the removed sample for determining the biomass concentration the samples were filtered through 0 45 μm cellulose acetate filters dried in an oven at 105 c for 2 h until the weight of the filters remained stable then weighted to calculate the dry weight of the samples 15 37 after filtration the liquid samples were prepared for analysis after eliminating some of the remained cells the concentrations of cod n nh4 and p po4 3 mg l 1 of liquid samples were measured based on standard methods 38 dry weight and

order to determine which system had a significant difference with others holm sidak test was conducted for every binary combination of the systems 3 results and discussion 3 1 cod removal the cod removal efficiencies were calculated for all the reactors and the results are presented in fig 1 the final removal efficiencies of 96 95 and 97 were observed in the mixed reactors with algae as ratio of 5 1 1 1 and 1 5 respectively according to statistical analysis the removal efficiencies in these reactors were not significantly different p value 0 115 reflecting the fact that the initial algae and as inoculum ratios have no significant impact on cod removal efficiency only microalgae and only sludge reactors were not able to eliminate the cod more than 77 and 80 respectively the low amount of removal in these reactors showed the importance of cooperation between microalgae and sludge on cod elimination because of the lack of sludge as the main co2 producer in only algae reactor organic carbon decomposition did not take place successfully and resulted in low removal efficiency the results of this study were comparable with literature su et al 9 showed that cod removal efficiencies were more than 90 in the reactors with different ratios of algae and as in addition the reactors with only algae and only sludge reached the removal efficiencies less than 74 9 using chlorella sorokiniana cultured heterotrophically kim et al 36 could remove 40 and 80 of cod from wastewater with ammonia concentration of 10 and 20 mg l 1 respectively comparing the removal efficiencies for mixed algae as reactors investigated in this study with cod removal efficiencies in batch cultures reported by su et al 9 indicated that the batch and semi continuous mixed photo bioreactors could remove cod over 90 regardless of the initial inoculum ratio of algae and as however higher removal efficiencies were resulted from semi continuous reactors used in this study 3 2 ammonium removal n nh4 removal efficiencies were calculated and the results are presented in fig a the reactor with algae as ratio of 5 1 showed the highest final removal efficiency of 88 0 1 0 due to preference of microalgae to use ammonium as its main nitrogen source for autotrophic and heterotrophic growth this reactor reached the highest biomass production due to the proper cooperation between microalgae and as and subsequently enough available co2 for algae s autotrophic growth supplementary fig s2 n nh4 removal efficiencies of 70 0 2 0 29 5 1 6 79 3 1 5 and 64 3 1 2 were obtained for the reactors with only microalgae only sludge 1 1 and 1 5 algae as respectively one way anova indicated that n nh4 removal efficiencies were significantly different for different algae as ratio p value 0 05 despite the lack of as as the main co2 producer in the reactor with only microalgae this reactor could remove more than 75 n nh4 the main reason is that the organic carbon cod was used by microalgae as carbon source under darkness condition for mineralizing ammonium and heterotrophic growth 36 the reactor with only sludge could not remove more than 30 ammonium the main reason is that nitrification is a slow process 40 and the results of nitrogen removal indicate that this as did not contain a significant portion of effective nitrification bacteria also sludge does not have high ability in ammonium removal as microalgae 24 the mixed reactors with algae as ratio of 1 1 and 1 5 could not remove ammonium as high as the reactor with algae as ratio of 5 1 which indicated that initial inoculum ratio of microalgae and as affected the n nh4 removal therefore it is concluded that the higher the algae s initial inoculum ratio the higher the ammonium removal efficiency according to pourasgharian roudsari et al 37 the addition of as to microalgae in different mass ratios increased the n nh4 removal efficiencies in algae as based municipal wastewater treatment systems in batch mode in a previous study it has been shown that the reactor with algae as ratio of 5 1 in batch mode had the highest and fastest ammonium removal efficiency within 10 days 9 however compared with batch culture 23 the higher removal efficiency of the reactor with algae as ratio of 5 1 indicated that semi continuous mixed algae as photo bioreactors have higher ammonium removal abilities than batch cultures which is consistent with the literature where tested microalgae in semi continuous mode was more effective in removing n than batch cultures 39 according to statistical analysis p value 0 05 the significant nitrogen removal efficiency of the reactor 5 1 algae as in both batch and semi continuous cultures showed that this ratio could be the best to promote cooperation between algae and as for higher nutrient removal efficiency the higher removal efficiency of the reactor with algae as ratio of 1 5 than the reactor with only algae indicated that adding microalgae even in low ratio to as could increase the ammonium removal in wastewater treatment systems without mechanical aeration compared to the ratios of 5 1 and 1 1 algae as the ratio of 1 5 of algae as seemed to be unsuitable to improve cooperation between algae and as for nitrification the low initial inoculum ratio of microalgae in the reactor 1 5 could not provide enough oxygen for nitrification process 3 3 phosphorus removal the daily phosphorous removal efficiencies are shown in fig 2 b statistical analysis of phosphorous removal efficiencies using one way anova holm sidak test indicated a significant difference between different ratios of algae as p value 0 05 the highest final phosphorous removal efficiency was observed in the reactor with algae as ratio of 5 1 84 0 1 0 followed by the reactor with algae as ratio of 1 1 72 2 1 1 the other mixed reactor with algae as ratio of 1 5 reached a final removal efficiency of 60 1 1 3 the reactor with only microalgae could not remove more than 51 2 1 4 phosphorous despite the high capability of microalgae in mineralizing phosphorous two possible reasons may explain this 1 light inhibition due to high concentration of microalgae cells prevented the optimum autotrophic growth of microalgae 24 2 because of the lack of as as the main co2 supply in the reactor there was not enough co2 for microalgae photosynthesis despite the lack of as the microalgae were able to remove this amount of phosphorous this could be explained by considering the ability of chlorella to switch its metabolism between autotrophic and heterotrophic depending on carbon source and darkness or lightness condition 15 heterotrophic microalgae used cod as carbon source under darkness condition to mineralize phosphorous in addition by using cod heterotrophic microalgae produce co2 under darkness and this co2 could be used by autotrophic microalgae under light the reactor with only sludge had the lowest final removal efficiency of 30 due to the lack of microalgae and very poor phosphorous removal capability of as 24 in addition the reactor with only sludge had the lowest ph level therefore abiotic phosphorous precipitation did not take place 11 41 mixed algae as reactors showed better performance in removing phosphorous than only algae and only sludge bioreactors by increasing the amount of microalgae higher removal efficiency was observed the highest removal efficiency achieved by the reactor with algae as ratio of 5 1 indicated that in this ratio microalgae and as have the best cooperation for p po4 3 removal compared with batch cultures 23 semi continuous mixed algae as photo bioreactors had higher phosphorous removal abilities than batch cultures which is consistent with the literature where tested microalgae in semi continuous mode was more effective in removing p po4 3 than batch cultures 39 3 4 biomass concentration in the reactors the growth rates and doubling times for exponential growth phase were calculated by eq 1 and eq 2 respectively table 2 one way anova holm sidak test indicated that the mixed algae as reactors had significantly higher biomass concentration than only algae and only sludge reactors p value 0 05 due to cooperation between algae and as supplementary fig s2 microorganisms assimilate the nutrient for their growth then there is a direct relation between biomass production and nutrient removal in wastewater treatment reactors the mixed reactors achieved higher nutrient removal efficiencies than only algae and only sludge reactors the optimum reactor 5 1 which achieved the highest nutrient removal efficiency had the highest biomass productivity rate of 0 143d 1 lowest doubling time of 4 82 d and the highest biomass concentration the 1 1 and 1 5 algae as reactors respectively had the next highest removal efficiencies and growth rates these results showed that a higher growth rate leads to higher nutrient removal efficiency in addition in algae as system the initial concentration of activated sludge has an influence on the growth of c vulgaris 42 a higher initial inoculum ratio of microalgae in mixed algae as reactors sped up the microorganisms growth very high concentration of activated sludge was not suitable for algal growth 42 the reactors with algae as ratio of 5 1 and 1 1 reached slightly higher growth rates than the 1 5 culture 3 5 do variation under different ratios of microalgae and activated sludge the variations of do in the reactors with different algae as inoculum ratios are shown in fig 3 for the reactor with only sludge do was always at low level because of the lack of microalgae as the main oxygen producer in the reactor with only microalgae do had an increasing trend for 21 days a possible reason for this high do concentration is the lack of as as the main oxygen consumer in the reactor so the produced oxygen by microalgae through the photosynthesis process was accumulated and reached 13 mg l 1 on the last day of the experiments according to su et al 24 high oxygen level was observed in the reactor with only algae in batch culture the results of both batch and semi continuous cultures showed that the reactor with only microalgae can produce high amount of do without mechanical aeration chlorella can switch its metabolism between photoautotrophic and heterotrophic 43 using the photoperiod of 12 12 hr light dark enabled microalgae to use photoautotrophic metabolism under illumination for photosynthetic process 15 under darkness period microalgae changed its metabolism into heterotrophic and by using organic carbon as carbon source could produce co2 thorough photosynthesis 15 the produced co2 dissolved in water was used by autotrophic microalgae for photosynthesis this cycle helped microalgae to produce high amount of oxygen with no need for mechanical aeration in the reactor with microalgae as ratio of 1 5 discernable decrease of do in the beginning of the process was observed which indicated that the dominant population of as at the beginning of the experiment caused higher consumption of oxygen than what was produced the other possible reason for that is the high cod removal during the first days of the experiment fig 3 as has a considerable ability to mineralize organic carbon mineralizing organic carbon as consumed more oxygen and caused do concentration to decrease after three days the biomass concentration in the reactor started to increase supplementary fig s2 increasing the concentration of do showed that the amount of microalgae increased which indicated that symbiosis of microalgae and as promoted the microalgae s growth this increasing amount of do was continued until day 9 after that the do concentration reached an almost constant level which indicated that the amount of consumption and production of do reached an approximately fixed rate at 1 1 reactor in the beginning of the process do concentration was almost constant and after 13 days the oxygen rate was ascending which indicated that symbiosis of microalgae sludge facilitated the microalgae s growth and probably the microalgae population was dominant the difference between reactor 5 1 algae as and 1 1 is that because of the dominant population of microalgae in the reactor with algae as ratio of 5 1 the oxygen level was ascending at the beginning the amount of do in the reactor with algae as ratio of 5 1 was more than the reactor with only algae in the first days of the experiment one possible reason for this high level of do is the better condition of the microalgae in the 5 1 reactor due to the presence of as as the main co2 producer in a previous study by su et al 9 reactors with different ratios of algae and as had distinct level of oxygen during the experiment in batch culture all of the reactors experienced a duration time of low do and after that the oxygen level started to go up 9 the longest and lowest duration times 7 and 12 days of low do were observed in the reactors with algae as ratio of 5 1 and 1 5 in batch mode respectively 9 compared with batch culture semi continuous mixed algae as photo bioreactors never experienced the duration time of low do because all the reactors were fed with fresh synthetic wastewater every 24 h this feature of the semi continuous photo bioreactors showed that biological wastewater treatment process using algae as does not need the costly mechanical aeration 3 6 removal efficiencies in the membrane bioreactor the results obtained from the first group of the experiments showed that the ratio of 5 1 algae as is an optimum ratio for proper cooperation between algae and as for p po4 3 and n nh4 removal this ratio was used in the membrane bioreactor and the removal efficiencies were compared with the results obtained from semi continuous reactor and a similar study by sun et al 25 fig 4 shows the final p po4 3 and n nh4 removal efficiencies obtained from this study using membrane and semi continuous reactors and from literature using membrane bioreactor with algae as ratio of 5 1 it can be seen that using membrane bio reactor enhanced the removal efficiencies from 88 to 98 and from 84 to 89 for n nh4 and p po4 3 respectively this phenomenon is attributed to the high shear force aeration for preventing membrane fouling in mbr previous studies have shown that the amount of extracellular polymer substances epss production was promoted by higher shear force furthermore eps can stimulate the uptake of n by microalgae 25 26 therefore in this study the nitrogen removal efficiency increased in mbr comparing the results from this study with the removal efficiencies obtained by sun et al 25 using membrane reactor with a ratio of 1 1 showed that the membrane reactor containing 5 1 ratio of algae as used in this study had a better performance and reached higher removal efficiencies due to high ability of microalgae in nitrogen removal however in previous study by sun et al 25 the hrt was 12 h which was different than current study 3 days to have a better understanding about the effect of hrt and algae as ratio on removal efficiencies a future work should be conducted with an algae as ratio of 1 1 at an hrt of 12 h it can be concluded that using mbr containing algae as is suitable for the nutrient removal from the wastewater the main problem is membrane fouling that should be further studied to control the fouling in wastewater treatment systems although novel results were obtained from this research future works need to be done studying the effect of operating condition on nutrient removal performance temperature and hrt affect the growth rate and nutrient removal performance low to negative growth rates were observed in microalgal cultures operating at lower temperatures 7 8 using the optimum ratio obtained from this study the effect of temperature photo period and different hrt should be examined in future to find an optimum operating condition 4 conclusion semi continuous algal bacterial photo bioreactors were successfully used to treat domestic wastewater five different ratios of algae and as 5 1 1 1 1 5 only algae and only sludge were chosen chlorella vulgaris and aerobic as were used as microalgae and bacterial inoculums the results indicated that the different initial inoculum ratios of algae as had significant effects on ammonium and phosphorus removal the cod removal efficiencies were more than 90 regardless of microalgae and as inoculation ratios eliminating the need for mechanical aeration algae as wastewater treatment cultures reached the high nutrient removal the ratio of 5 1 algae as was found to be the best ratio for proper cooperation between algae and as for p po4 3 and n nh4 removal furthermore this study showed that semi continuous mixed algae as photo bioreactors had higher nutrient removal efficiencies than batch cultures finally the optimum ratio of 5 1 algae as were used in a membrane bioreactor and the results showed that this reactor enhanced the removal efficacies declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no competing interests funding this work was supported by iran national science foundation

13944,conventional wastewater treatment systems demand a high cost mechanical aeration using algal bacterial systems helps to reach a cost efficient treatment method by eliminating mechanical aeration since algae produce the oxygen needed for treatment process in this study two groups of experiments were performed for domestic wastewater treatment processes for the first group semi continuous microalgae bacterial photo bioreactors were cultivated chlorella vulgaris and activated sludge as were used as microalgae and bacterial inoculums respectively the effect of different algae and as ratios on the chemical oxygen demand cod n nh4 and p po4 3 removal was studied the removal efficiency of cod was above 93 for the three tested algae and as inoculum ratios 5 1 1 1 and 1 5 the reactor with algae as inoculum ratio of 5 1 achieved the highest final n nh4 and p po4 3 removal efficiencies 88 0 1 0 and 84 0 1 0 respectively furthermore the highest biomass concentration 1 96 g l 1 from initial amount of 0 3 g l 1 was observed in the reactor with algae as ratio of 5 1 the ratio of 5 1 algae as was found as the optimum ratio which promoted the cooperation between microalgae and as for nutrient removal for the second group of experiments the optimum ratio of 5 1 algae as was used in a membrane bioreactor and the results showed that this reactor enhanced the final removal efficacies from 88 to 98 and from 84 to 89 for n nh4 and p po4 3 respectively keywords algal bacterial culture membrane bioreactor microalgae photo bioreactor wastewater treatment 1 introduction biological methods in wastewater treatment are preferred due to be more cost efficient and environmentally friendly 1 4 the use of microalgae bacterial systems for both domestic and industrial wastewater treatments has received a great deal of attention in recent years 5 they are more commonly used as an alternative bio system mostly in tropical and subtropical regions 1 6 7 conventional wastewater treatment systems based on as demand a high cost mechanical aeration therefore introducing a more cost effective method seems to be essential using algal bacterial systems helps to reach a cost efficient treatment method by eliminating mechanical aeration under illumination algae assimilate the nutrients nh4 no3 and po4 3 available in the wastewater and simultaneously produce oxygen by photosynthesis needed for heterotrophic bacteria to mineralize organic materials in return they utilize the carbon dioxide released from bacterial respiration to complete photosynthetic cycle thereby reducing the emission of greenhouse gases these systems establish a cheaper alternative to mechanical aeration 8 12 eisenberg et al 13 estimated energy savings of more than 50 for an algal bacterial system compared to a conventional wastewater treatment process chlorella and scenedesmus are unicellular green algae which are widely used in wastewater treatment 14 microalgae can grow under autotrophic with inorganic carbon source and continuous light heterotrophic inorganic carbon source and without light and mixotrophic both organic and inorganic sources and without continuous light growth conditions 13 15 municipal wastewater is a proper source of nitrogen phosphorous and other elements e g cu mn ca fe k s which makes it a great medium for microalgae s growth 11 16 in microalgae based wastewater treatment systems the functions of microalgae include absorption of hazardous heavy metals o2 supply and nutrient uptake 12 17 19 furthermore algae photosynthesis increases the ph and the amount of dissolved oxygen do which results in indirect disinfection without appropriate treatment extra amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus in discharged wastewater cause downstream eutrophication and damage the ecosystem 19 although there are chemical and physical treatment technologies they consume a large amount of energy during the removal process 20 chemical treatment methods are not only costly processes but can also lead to secondary contamination of sludge byproduct however compared with chemical and physical processes nutrients can be removed in a cheaper and safer way by using algae based systems 17 18 21 22 accumulation of nitrogen and phosphorus into algal and bacterial biomass increases in the case of using algal bacterial system only 26 n nh4 was assimilated into biomass during the use of bacterial system in order to treat 1 g acetonitrile however using algal bacterial culture led to assimilation of 54 n nh4 into biomass under the same condition 10 23 the initial inoculum ratios of algae and bacteria may affect the symbiosis of algae and bacteria and then result in different nutrient removal efficiencies 24 25 guieysse et al 12 showed that the initial inoculation ratio of chlorella sorokiniana and ralstonia basilensis has a significant impact on the salicylate degradation efficiency in closed systems as has higher organic nutrient removal ability than the normal bacteria included in municipal wastewater therefore as can be used as bacterial inoculum in algal bacterial based domestic wastewater treatment systems to promote the nutrient removal efficiencies 24 continuous microalgae cultivation in wastewater for nutrient removal and biomass production for biofuel has been carried out in both photobioreactors and open ponds 26 28 one of the biggest concerns of these systems is washout problems membrane bioreactors mbr can address this problem by membrane filtration 26 mbr have been widely used recently because of their advantage of high sludge concentration small footprint and high effluent quality 25 however high concentrations of mixed liquor suspended solids mlss would increase the non newtonian viscosities which can increase the aeration energy consumption therefore it is needed to develop an efficient technique to reduce membrane fouling and decrease aeration cost in the mbr system there are some studies on combining algae system with mbr to remove n and p in wastewater 29 30 however most of these studies used external co2 supply because of the absence of sludge bacteria and resulted in slow nutrient removal efficiency of only algae 25 31 furthermore algae cells when using membrane filtration cause dramatically fouling 32 previous researches have been shown that combining algae activated sludge and mbr decreases the aeration consumption and the membrane fouling 25 33 many studies have achieved an excellent performance for different algae sludge inoculation ratios in batch mode ruiz martin et al 34 showed that semi continuous algal systems achieved higher removal efficiencies than batch cultures however the nutrient removal performance of semi continuous algal bacterial systems as well as the effect of algae sludge inoculation ratio in these reactors is still unknown therefore the first objective of this work is to find the optimum ratio of algae and as in semi continuous system to obtain the highest nutrient removal efficiencies second the optimum ratio is used in an algal as mbr to enhance the removal efficiencies during this research the experiments were conducted in 2 groups the first group of experiments was operated in semi continuous algal bacterial photo bioreactors without mechanical aeration five different ratios of algae and as were used to find the optimum ratio that enhances the cooperation between microalgae and as for the removal of cod ammonium and phosphorous from municipal wastewater for the second group of the experiments the optimum ratio of algae and activated sludge obtained from the first group of experiments was used in a membrane bioreactor to enhance the removal efficiencies 2 material and methods 2 1 microorganisms the algae inoculum chlorella vulgaris was obtained through the research institute of applied science tehran iran microalgae were pre cultivated photo autotrophically in sterile n 8 medium at ambient temperature and were continuously illuminated by fluorescent lamps under light intensity of 2000 lx the aerobic as was obtained from an as reactor in the ekbatan municipal wastewater treatment plant in tehran iran for adaptation both microalgae and as were fed with synthetic municipal wastewater using synthetic medium not only simplifies the use for initial laboratory based experiments but also makes it easy to analyze major components without considering unknown variables such as biotic variables 35 2 2 experimental operation the first group of the experiments was carried out in semi continuous culture in stirred cylindrical glass reactors with working volume of 650 ml for 21 days for this study semi continuous experiments were conducted with a fixed hydraulic retention time hrt of 7 days in all runs which was maintained by feeding 93 ml of feedstock and removing 93 ml of effluent daily an hrt between 7 and 10 days and room temperature are found to be the optimum operating condition for microalgae bacterial systems 8 five different mass ratios of algae and as inoculum were considered the features of the reactors are shown in the table 1 the reactors were operated in the same condition and ambient temperature around 25 c and were illuminated by fluorescent lamps with a light density of 2000 lx under a photoperiod of 12 12 h light dark the initial biomass concentration was chosen as 0 3 g l 1 according to the algal biomass concentration in common microalgal wastewater treatment processes magnetic stirrers were used as mixers with a mixing velocity of 300 rpm to avoid light limitation the sedimentation of biomass and nutrient gradients therefore the photo bioreactors can be considered as completely mixed reactors the velocity of 300 rpm was chosen due to its higher nutrient removal efficiency as well as higher algae growth rate 9 the second part of the experiments was performed in a cylindrical submerged membrane bioreactor with a working volume of 2 5 l using the optimum ratio obtained from the first group of the experiments supplementary fig s1 27 a circle membrane module with a hydrophilic millipore mixed cellulose ester mce with a pore size of 0 2 μm was used the module was vertically submerged in the center of the bioreactor the reactors operated at constant permeate flux 17 3 lmh to provide a hrt of 3 days which was controlled with a peristaltic pump the reactor was fed continuously with the synthetic wastewater and the feed flow rate was controlled by a level controller the reactor was illuminated with three cool light fluorescent lamps with a total intensity of 6000 lx which was fixed around and outside the cylinder the reactor was operated under room temperature of 25 c synthetic municipal wastewater was used as feed for all the reactors supplementary table s1 glucose nh4cl kno3 and kh2po4 were used as organic carbon ammonium nitrate and phosphate sources respectively the value and content of other required elements for microorganisms

despite the high capability of microalgae in mineralizing phosphorous two possible reasons may explain this 1 light inhibition due to high concentration of microalgae cells prevented the optimum autotrophic growth of microalgae 24 2 because of the lack of as as the main co2 supply in the reactor there was not enough co2 for microalgae photosynthesis despite the lack of as the microalgae were able to remove this amount of phosphorous this could be explained by considering the ability of chlorella to switch its metabolism between autotrophic and heterotrophic depending on carbon source and darkness or lightness condition 15 heterotrophic microalgae used cod as carbon source under darkness condition to mineralize phosphorous in addition by using cod heterotrophic microalgae produce co2 under darkness and this co2 could be used by autotrophic microalgae under light the reactor with only sludge had the lowest final removal efficiency of 30 due to the lack of microalgae and very poor phosphorous removal capability of as 24 in addition the reactor with only sludge had the lowest ph level therefore abiotic phosphorous precipitation did not take place 11 41 mixed algae as reactors showed better performance in removing phosphorous than only algae and only sludge bioreactors by increasing the amount of microalgae higher removal efficiency was observed the highest removal efficiency achieved by the reactor with algae as ratio of 5 1 indicated that in this ratio microalgae and as have the best cooperation for p po4 3 removal compared with batch cultures 23 semi continuous mixed algae as photo bioreactors had higher phosphorous removal abilities than batch cultures which is consistent with the literature where tested microalgae in semi continuous mode was more effective in removing p po4 3 than batch cultures 39 3 4 biomass concentration in the reactors the growth rates and doubling times for exponential growth phase were calculated by eq 1 and eq 2 respectively table 2 one way anova holm sidak test indicated that the mixed algae as reactors had significantly higher biomass concentration than only algae and only sludge reactors p value 0 05 due to cooperation between algae and as supplementary fig s2 microorganisms assimilate the nutrient for their growth then there is a direct relation between biomass production and nutrient removal in wastewater treatment reactors the mixed reactors achieved higher nutrient removal efficiencies than only algae and only sludge reactors the optimum reactor 5 1 which achieved the highest nutrient removal efficiency had the highest biomass productivity rate of 0 143d 1 lowest doubling time of 4 82 d and the highest biomass concentration the 1 1 and 1 5 algae as reactors respectively had the next highest removal efficiencies and growth rates these results showed that a higher growth rate leads to higher nutrient removal efficiency in addition in algae as system the initial concentration of activated sludge has an influence on the growth of c vulgaris 42 a higher initial inoculum ratio of microalgae in mixed algae as reactors sped up the microorganisms growth very high concentration of activated sludge was not suitable for algal growth 42 the reactors with algae as ratio of 5 1 and 1 1 reached slightly higher growth rates than the 1 5 culture 3 5 do variation under different ratios of microalgae and activated sludge the variations of do in the reactors with different algae as inoculum ratios are shown in fig 3 for the reactor with only sludge do was always at low level because of the lack of microalgae as the main oxygen producer in the reactor with only microalgae do had an increasing trend for 21 days a possible reason for this high do concentration is the lack of as as the main oxygen consumer in the reactor so the produced oxygen by microalgae through the photosynthesis process was accumulated and reached 13 mg l 1 on the last day of the experiments according to su et al 24 high oxygen level was observed in the reactor with only algae in batch culture the results of both batch and semi continuous cultures showed that the reactor with only microalgae can produce high amount of do without mechanical aeration chlorella can switch its metabolism between photoautotrophic and heterotrophic 43 using the photoperiod of 12 12 hr light dark enabled microalgae to use photoautotrophic metabolism under illumination for photosynthetic process 15 under darkness period microalgae changed its metabolism into heterotrophic and by using organic carbon as carbon source could produce co2 thorough photosynthesis 15 the produced co2 dissolved in water was used by autotrophic microalgae for photosynthesis this cycle helped microalgae to produce high amount of oxygen with no need for mechanical aeration in the reactor with microalgae as ratio of 1 5 discernable decrease of do in the beginning of the process was observed which indicated that the dominant population of as at the beginning of the experiment caused higher consumption of oxygen than what was produced the other possible reason for that is the high cod removal during the first days of the experiment fig 3 as has a considerable ability to mineralize organic carbon mineralizing organic carbon as consumed more oxygen and caused do concentration to decrease after three days the biomass concentration in the reactor started to increase supplementary fig s2 increasing the concentration of do showed that the amount of microalgae increased which indicated that symbiosis of microalgae and as promoted the microalgae s growth this increasing amount of do was continued until day 9 after that the do concentration reached an almost constant level which indicated that the amount of consumption and production of do reached an approximately fixed rate at 1 1 reactor in the beginning of the process do concentration was almost constant and after 13 days the oxygen rate was ascending which indicated that symbiosis of microalgae sludge facilitated the microalgae s growth and probably the microalgae population was dominant the difference between reactor 5 1 algae as and 1 1 is that because of the dominant population of microalgae in the reactor with algae as ratio of 5 1 the oxygen level was ascending at the beginning the amount of do in the reactor with algae as ratio of 5 1 was more than the reactor with only algae in the first days of the experiment one possible reason for this high level of do is the better condition of the microalgae in the 5 1 reactor due to the presence of as as the main co2 producer in a previous study by su et al 9 reactors with different ratios of algae and as had distinct level of oxygen during the experiment in batch culture all of the reactors experienced a duration time of low do and after that the oxygen level started to go up 9 the longest and lowest duration times 7 and 12 days of low do were observed in the reactors with algae as ratio of 5 1 and 1 5 in batch mode respectively 9 compared with batch culture semi continuous mixed algae as photo bioreactors never experienced the duration time of low do because all the reactors were fed with fresh synthetic wastewater every 24 h this feature of the semi continuous photo bioreactors showed that biological wastewater treatment process using algae as does not need the costly mechanical aeration 3 6 removal efficiencies in the membrane bioreactor the results obtained from the first group of the experiments showed that the ratio of 5 1 algae as is an optimum ratio for proper cooperation between algae and as for p po4 3 and n nh4 removal this ratio was used in the membrane bioreactor and the removal efficiencies were compared with the results obtained from semi continuous reactor and a similar study by sun et al 25 fig 4 shows the final p po4 3 and n nh4 removal efficiencies obtained from this study using membrane and semi continuous reactors and from literature using membrane bioreactor with algae as ratio of 5 1 it can be seen that using membrane bio reactor enhanced the removal efficiencies from 88 to 98 and from 84 to 89 for n nh4 and p po4 3 respectively this phenomenon is attributed to the high shear force aeration for preventing membrane fouling in mbr previous studies have shown that the amount of extracellular polymer substances epss production was promoted by higher shear force furthermore eps can stimulate the uptake of n by microalgae 25 26 therefore in this study the nitrogen removal efficiency increased in mbr comparing the results from this study with the removal efficiencies obtained by sun et al 25 using membrane reactor with a ratio of 1 1 showed that the membrane reactor containing 5 1 ratio of algae as used in this study had a better performance and reached higher removal efficiencies due to high ability of microalgae in nitrogen removal however in previous study by sun et al 25 the hrt was 12 h which was different than current study 3 days to have a better understanding about the effect of hrt and algae as ratio on removal efficiencies a future work should be conducted with an algae as ratio of 1 1 at an hrt of 12 h it can be concluded that using mbr containing algae as is suitable for the nutrient removal from the wastewater the main problem is membrane fouling that should be further studied to control the fouling in wastewater treatment systems although novel results were obtained from this research future works need to be done studying the effect of operating condition on nutrient removal performance temperature and hrt affect the growth rate and nutrient removal performance low to negative growth rates were observed in microalgal cultures operating at lower temperatures 7 8 using the optimum ratio obtained from this study the effect of temperature photo period and different hrt should be examined in future to find an optimum operating condition 4 conclusion semi continuous algal bacterial photo bioreactors were successfully used to treat domestic wastewater five different ratios of algae and as 5 1 1 1 1 5 only algae and only sludge were chosen chlorella vulgaris and aerobic as were used as microalgae and bacterial inoculums the results indicated that the different initial inoculum ratios of algae as had significant effects on ammonium and phosphorus removal the cod removal efficiencies were more than 90 regardless of microalgae and as inoculation ratios eliminating the need for mechanical aeration algae as wastewater treatment cultures reached the high nutrient removal the ratio of 5 1 algae as was found to be the best ratio for proper cooperation between algae and as for p po4 3 and n nh4 removal furthermore this study showed that semi continuous mixed algae as photo bioreactors had higher nutrient removal efficiencies than batch cultures finally the optimum ratio of 5 1 algae as were used in a membrane bioreactor and the results showed that this reactor enhanced the removal efficacies declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no competing interests funding this work was supported by iran national science foundation
