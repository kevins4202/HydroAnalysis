13725,the present study investigated the applicability of direct contact membrane distillation dcmd in the treatment of a reverse osmosis concentrate roc from petrochemical wastewater three commercial flat sheet membranes made of polyethylene or polytetrafluoroethylene having different contact angles pore sizes porosities and thicknesses were supplied by aquastill with the following membrane designation standard oleophobic and teflon firstly the different dcmd membranes were characterised in experiments with deionised water then tests with roc with a temperature setting to 60 c in the feed and 20 c on the distillate side were performed in full recirculation mode along 250 h operating time and in concentration mode along 72 h operating time achieving volumetric concentration factors around 10 the dcmd performance in terms of flux and quality of the distillate was evaluated during all experiments under different operating conditions after obtaining the results all membranes satisfactorily achieved a final water recovery ratio close to 90 as well as high rejection factors above 99 5 for all parameters analysed they also produced high quality water with low electrical conductivity around 2 7 Î¼s cm 1 all conditions met the requirements for water reuse in the petrochemical sector in this case to treat wastewater with the tested characteristics the oleophobic membrane from aquastill presented better efficiency with a minimum water vapour flux reduction and a water recovery ratio of 90 keywords petrochemical wastewater reverse osmosis reverse osmosis concentrate direct contact membrane distillation 1 introduction it is known that membrane separation processes typically used for wastewater treatment include microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf nanofiltration nf reverse osmosis ro or electrodialysis ed and most of these are pressure driven technologies using the pressure difference as driving force but the hydraulic pressure difference as the mass transfer driving force has its own disadvantages one of them is the osmotic pressure limitation 1 especially when treating hypersaline wastewater through ro processes a difficulty that does not occur with membrane distillation md whose prevalent tolerance to high salinity renders it a suitable technology to treat wastewater such as concentrated ro brines 2 the huge amount of concentrate that results from the ro process when this technology is used to produce drinking water and also for wastewater treatment 3 4 is still a matter to the development of processes aiming at water reuse the reverse osmosis concentrate roc may contain persistent pollutants both organic and inorganic as well as noxious factors therefore proper roc management has been a significant concern in the practice of water recovery that is why the inefficient disposal of that derivative is extremely noxious to the environment causing an expressive loss of water resources must of all 5 6 a situation that claims for a totally integrated effluent treatment including the roc to the water cycle and henceforth preventing any risk of contamination 3 among different technologies being studied to mitigate the environmental impact caused by the discharge of roc md is one of the best ways to treat high salinity solutions such as roc reaching elevated levels of water recuperation 7 8 among different md processes direct contact membrane distillation dcmd has been largely studied as described in previous studies from swaminathan et al 9 10 dcmd is a very efficient configuration of md in which a microporous and hydrophobic membrane is in direct contact with both a hot feed and a cooler distillate basically water evaporates on the feed side of the md membrane s pores and condenses on the distillate side the vapour pressure difference across the membrane is the driving force which results from the temperature gradient in the boundary layers contiguous to the membrane surface 11 15 of all the particular md arrangements in this work dcmd was selected to perform the experiments in this system the membrane is in contact with liquid on both sides and the flux of water from the feed bulk toward the membrane drags with it dissolved solutes suspended solids and microbes which can accumulate near the membrane surface forming a fouling layer and degrading membrane performance these phenomena are strongly associated with the incoming md feed water quality and can lead to membrane wetting reducing the distillate quality 16 19 often in the high salinity wastewater recuperation fouling and wetting of membranes are expressive concerns that can obstruct a more disseminated application of md technology indeed caused by inconvenient materials that accumulate on the membrane surface and pores fouling induces a decrease in water vapour flux while the membrane wetting the direct permeation of the feed solution through the membrane pores results in reduced contaminant rejection and overall process failure 20 basically the membrane properties such as pore size porosity thickness liquid entry pressure lep and type of material influence all the process and its efficiency 21 22 on the whole the thermal and solution concentration as well as the module characteristics constitute the main processes and operating variables none the less by creating fouling situations it is known that constituents of feed solutions certain ions organics etc and its ph can also affect the process stability 23 anyway md is considered a unique process by which the desalination of hypersaline streams for example can be achieved but several transport phenomena may restrain the water vapour flux through the membranes under use including the decrease in partial vapour pressure and specifically across the layers the heat and mass transfer resistance in the same way as concentration and temperature polarisations or loss in heat transfer 24 25 in different circumstances md has been also presented for recovery of valuable salts from effluents nowadays studies regarding md treating roc mainly address seawater roc having high salinity and low organic matter content 26 29 besides seawater roc studies md has also been used to treat wastewater having other physicochemical characteristics yu et al 30 employed dcmd to treat cooling tower blowdown water which was mainly composed of inorganic material presenting total dissolved solids tds of 4 75 g l 1 naidu et al 31 evaluated dcmd treating roc from biologically treated sewage combined with storm water from sydney olympic park this roc was characterised by low contents of tds 1 49 g l 1 and turbidity 0 11 ntu but approximately 60 mg l 1 of dissolved organic carbon doc as well as micropollutants before md tests the roc was pre treated with granular activated carbon gac to reduce doc and micropollutants contents and thus minimise organic and inorganic fouling incidence despite these wastewater treatment studies there is still a gap on research addressing md treating petrochemical roc which in turn has a different composition from other md feed water in a previous work 32 tertiary petrochemical wastewater was treated by ro resulting in a roc with 1 1 g l 1 of tds and 23 mg l 1 of chemical oxygen demand cod as well as organic compounds from the petrochemical process further treatment of this roc by md may allow water recovery in fact studies concerning petrochemical wastewater treatment aiming water recovery by md were conducted by santos et al 33 in their study the petrochemical wastewater was treated by an electrodialysis reversal edr pilot plant and the authors have analysed the possible dcmd application with ptfe pp membranes employing a pretreatment filtration method the drop in water vapour flow rate was minimised by 30 and the rate of water recovery increased from 56 to 75 in comparison with the test carried out without pretreatment thanks to the high rejection of pollutants the researchers concluded that the physical chemical condition of water recovered by edr dcmd enables it to be reused mostly in these specific industrial processes other authors 34 have conducted a study with a solution prepared in the laboratory to mimic an oily wastewater at this work the application of an integrated fo md system for sustainable water reuse from oily wastewater with relatively high salinity is proposed and investigated the hybrid fo md system has demonstrated a water recovery of 90 in the present study the tertiary petrochemical wastewater firstly concentrated by ro 32 was further treated by dcmd aiming at higher water recovery the md performance in terms of water vapour flux and distillate quality was investigated with three different commercial membranes and related to their characteristics i e thickness pore size porosity and contact angle and with the operating parameters including feed velocity temperature and concentration the main objective is to enhance the practical use of dcmd determining the best conditions for water recovery from a real petrochemical roc on account of this in addition to the study of their propensity for fouling incidence from supersaturated roc solution an additional benefit to this approach it was studied the direct contact membrane distillation dcmd in treating a real petrochemical roc without any pretreatment 2 materials and methods the present study was performed for the treatment of a roc by a md process as represented in the experimental setup of fig 1 2 1 roc characterisation for the proposed study the roc was obtained after the treatment of petrochemical wastewater in a ro pilot system in the petrochemical industry the conventional wastewater treatment plant has primary secondary and tertiary treatments as described elsewhere 32 35 after the tertiary treatment the wastewater was collected and sent to the ro pilot system which was operated under the optimal conditions and using the same membrane employed in a previous study 32 after treatment with ro samples of the permeate and concentrate were collected for physicochemical characterisation and the roc was directly used as feed water on the dcmd 2 2 dcmd 2 2 1 membranes in this work three commercial microporous hydrophobic flat sheet membranes supplied by aquastill were used a polytetrafluoroethylene based ptfe and two polyethylene pe based pe s pe o both pe membranes present similar caracteristics however the second one pe o has relatively low porosity and higher contact angle compared to the first one pe s the details of both pe membrane production were provided by aquastill both membranes are produced based on uhmwpe ultra high molecular weigth polyethylene that is hydrophobic by nature however for some applications it is needed that the membrane is oleophobic via an external company the base membrane is treated using vacuum plasma deposition with a eptfe like material not disclosed by the company and in this way the morphology of the base membrane is more or less preserved while a thin layer of eptfe like material is deposited on all external surfaces inside the membrane in this way the base membranes can be functionalized regarding the contact angle for the oleophobic material the contact angle is higher than 118 additionally the surface tension is smaller than 18 dynes cm 1 iso 8296 2003 and n heptane will not penetrate the oleophobic membrane aatcc tm 118 summarised in table 1 the three membranes main characteristics were supplied by aquastill 2 2 2 operating procedure in fig 1 is illustrated the bench scale dcmd equipment used in the present study basically the system has an acrylic cell with a depth width and length of 1 0 9 5 and 13 8 cm respectively the feeding tank was supplied with 5 l of solution deionised water synthetic solution or roc in the distillate 1 l of deionised water with an electrical conductivity of 2 Î¼s cm 1 was circulated on the cold stream which was adjusted to a temperature of 20 c with an accuracy of 0 5 c besides that two temperature sensors were instaled on both tanks distillate and feed and two other sensors were instaled near both sides of the membrane surfaces further in counter current mode accomplished by circulating pumps the feed and distillate flows were channelled into the acrylic cell at a tangential velocity of 0 02 m s 1 the distillate reservoir allowed the excess distillate to overflow into a collection vessel which was weighed continuously on an analytical balance being the distillate mass recorded on a computer as represented in fig 1 thus the water vapour mass flux j in kg h Â¹ m 2 was calculated using eq 1 1 j Î´ m a x Î´ t where Î´m is the mass of water vapour or distillate kg a is the effective membrane area m2 and Î´t h is the permeation time in order to check the decline of the water vapour flux over the operation time the normalised flux i e the ratio between the water vapour flux at time t j and the initial time j 0 was evaluated to characterise the membranes dcmd experiments were carried out first using deionised water at different feed temperatures t f 50 60 and 70 c maintaining a constant distillate temperature t d at 20 c after that the roc was treated by dcmd at a moderate feed temperature of 60 c with the permeate kept at 20 c the rejection efficiency r was determined as 2 r 1 c d c f 100 where c f mg l 1 is the concentration in the feed and c d mg l 1 is the concentration on the distillate tests were performed in full recirculation mode where concentrate and distillate after weighed streams are recirculated to the feed tank to study the variation in the water vapour fluxes and in the solute rejections as a function of the operating conditions in these tests small samples representing less than 5 of the feed solution were collected at the beginning and end of each assay for physicochemical characterisation ph conductivity total organic carbon toc and ion chromatography analysis these experiments were carried out to assess the performance of the membranes in long term tests of about 250 h in addition tests in concentration mode where the distillate is collected separately as the concentrate stream recirculates to the feed tank were conducted to evaluate the water vapour flux solute rejection and temperature polarisation coefficient tpc as a function of the water recovery ratio wrr using eqs 3 and 4 3 t p c t f m t d m t f t d and 4 w r r v d v f x 100 where t f m and t d m are the temperatures at membrane surfaces for the feed and distillate while t f and t d are the bulk temperatures on the feed and distillate sides respectively v f and v d are the feed and distillate volumes respectively here at different wrr distillate and concentrate samples were collected for physicochemical characterisation ph conductivity toc and ion chromatography analysis after collection the samples were stored under refrigeration at 4 c and re established at room temperature 20 25 c before being analysed in general these contents were examined within 4 days of collection but when their storage exceeded this time they were preventively frozen at 20 c until they could be evaluated after finishing each test the membranes were cleaned by circulating deionised water at 60 c and at the tangential velocity of 0 02 m s 1 deionised water was flowed until a stable flux was reached with no subsequent increment which was considered the restored water vapour flux value in all experiments it took about 12 h to water vapour flux stabilisation besides the roc treatment binary synthetic solutions were also evaluated the main inorganic salts identified in the real effluent from the petrochemical industry are the elements na ca mg so4 and cl among other salts that have also been identified but in lesser concentration in this sense four types of synthetic binary solutions 2 g l 1 of nacl mgcl2 cacl2 or na2so4 were prepared and treated by dcmd in order to favour the understanding of the fouling behaviour in the membranes 2 3 analytical methods the ph and conductivity of the samples were measured using azph and phtek portable meters respectively analyses of ions and toc were performed in the distillate and concentrate samples by ionic chromatography and catalytic combustion respectively as described elsewhere 36 qualitative analysis for organic compounds present in roc and distillate samples obtained in concentration mode with the three membranes was performed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms with a qp2010 from shimadzu in the scanning range of 35 400 u through comparison with data from the nist ms 2008 library the membranes hydrophobicity was monitored by measuring the water contact angle samples of each membrane virgin after roc treatment and after cleaning with deionised water 2 4 cm in size were taken and stored in a becker with deionised water they were then stirred at 120 rpm for 5 h and air dried prior to analysis the contact angle was measured by the sessile drop method employing a goniometer phoenix mini where 1 8 2 0 Î¼l of milli q water was carefully dropped onto the membrane surface this procedure was performed in five different positions for each membrane sample taking the average value as the contact angle scanning electron microscopy sem analyses with an image acquisition system jsm model 6510 l v were also carried out to evaluate the morphology of the membrane surfaces x ray energy dispersion spectroscopy eds thermo scientific model 6742a 1ues sn analyses were also performed for information on the chemical composition of the fouling layer 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristic of the roc to feed the ro wastewater treated by the petrochemical industry was used in its most essential characteristic the petrochemical wastewater is a complex composition containing oil emulsifiers fatty acids bactericides corrosion inhibitors and many other chemicals among them detergents and surfactants possibly also present could reduce the value of surface tension diminishing the quality of the product 37 besides that as md employs hydrophobic membranes to treat and recover fresh water it is plausible the occurrence of fouling due to high hydrophobic contaminants maybe present in feed water like oil or hydrophobic organic material precisely because of the strong hydrophobic hydrophobic interaction 20 therefore accordingly to han et al 8 the presence of oil intensify the fouling activity through hydrophobic hydrophobic interaction with membrane surface and pores however the presence of only oil in feed water sometimes led to higher fouling and pronounced flux decline insofar as the affinity between the hydrophobic species that is to say the oil itself to the hydrophobic md membrane is higher the characteristics of the petrochemical wastewater ro permeate and roc are presented in table 2 where it is possible to observe that the ro rejection efficiency was higher than 90 for all evaluated parameters these results also show that the permeate characteristics are within the criteria established by the petrochemical industry for water reuse in cooling towers 38 the roc was used as md feed water although presenting low organic content in terms of cod and toc which can also be attributed to the presence of humic substances generated in the biological treatment 39 a qualitative characterisation of the roc showed that this organic matter is associated with 16 organic compounds typical of the petrochemical process 3 eicosene 1 2 benzenedicarboxylic acid bis 2 methylpropyl ester 2 heptadecanone 1 heptadecene n hexadecanoic acid heptasiloxane 1 1 3 3 5 5 7 7 9 9 11 11 13 13 tetradecamethyl octadecanoic acid 1 nonadecene hexanedioic acid bis 2 ethylhexyl ester heneicosane di n octyl phthalate 9 octadecenamide z decanedioic acid bis 2 ethylhexyl ester eicosane 1 iodo squalene and nonacosane these compounds are characterised by presenting low surface tension from 27 to 36 dyn cm 1 what could induce membrane pore wetting and high log kow from 4 to 14 what can cause adsorption to the hydrophobic md membrane see supplementary material table s1 according to tonini et al 40 the detected hydrocarbons are typical of wastewater from petrochemical industries the petrochemical industry in question produces first generation products using petrochemical naphtha as the main raw material 41 the light fraction of naphtha is rich in paraffinic or alkane compounds being used for the production of olefins alkenes alkadienes or dienes 41 43 the compounds identified in the present work have already been classified by jorfi et al 44 as predominant by products of the degradation of petroleum products commonly found in this type of environment according to klauck 45 1 nonadecene is used in lubricants and fuel additives among the identified peaks the one that stood out the most by intensity was the di n octyl phthalate compound zhu et al 46 reported that phthalate esters are among persistent organic pollutants most frequently detected in the environment and according to gao and wen 47 are used in the manufacturing and processing of plastic products 3 2 characterisation of md membranes effect of feed temperature and flow velocity on water vapour distillate flux to optimise the dcmd performance the effect of both feed temperature and flow velocity were investigated as shown in fig 2 fig 2a shows the water vapour flux variation with feed temperature 50 60 and 70 c when pure water was used as feed for the three tested membranes which have different pore sizes materials thicknesses and porosity the distillate temperature was kept constant at 20 c the md water vapour fluxes for all membranes followed the increase of the feed temperature the water vapour flux doubled by increasing the feed temperature from 50 to 70 c which is related to the increase in the water vapour pressure following an arrhenius type dependence with temperature 21 48 from the antoine equation the vapour pressure at the liquid vapour interface will exponentially increase with temperature enhancing the driving force 49 the three tested membranes showed reasonable dcmd water vapour fluxes the ptfe t membrane which had the greatest hydrophobicity and smallest thickness showed the highest water vapour flux other authors have also reported that the water vapour flux is inversely proportional to membrane thickness 1 50 then pe s and pe o membranes which are made of pe presented the same behaviour when the influence of feed temperature on the water vapour fluxes was evaluated in addition a higher feed temperature is beneficial reducing the feed solution viscosity and therefore decreasing the mass and heat transfer boundary layer thickness on the other hand some studies have shown that inorganic and organic fouling may increase with feed temperature 1 31 water evaporation and temperature increase create supersaturation on the feed side that leads to nucleation and crystallisation in the feed and on the membrane surface resulting in inorganic fouling mainly considering that the solubility of individual salts may be positively or negatively correlated with temperature 20 23 about organic fouling at higher temperatures water vapor flux increases on md and this may lead to higher concentration of organic compounds at the membrane interface due to the concentration polarisation effect 23 therefore in the present study the feed temperature was set at 60 c an intermediate temperature in order to minimise the incidence of fouling fig 2b shows that the water vapour flux increased with feed velocity for all membranes the water vapour flux is closely related to fluid dynamics so it can be improved by increasing the feed velocity 51 as the flow velocity increased to about 0 01 m s 1 the water vapour flux showed a plateau despite this in the following tests with roc the highest feed velocity 0 02 m s 1 which corresponds to the maximum capacity of the pumps 1 4 l min 1 was selected to minimise the possible concentration polarisation effects this would reduce the boundary layer thickness and increase the mass and heat transfer coefficients and consequently would decrease temperature and concentration polarisation 52 chen et al 53 also reported the boundary layer resistance minimisation at an increased flow rate leads towards enhanced mass transfer by increasing the heat transfer coefficient the enhancement in flow rate results in high water vapour flux due to the reduced thermal boundary layer thickness and reduces temperature polarisation effects both asymptotic 51 54 and linear 55 56 relationships between water vapour flux and feed velocity were reported by balancing the pump energy and water vapour flux a feed flow velocity of 0 02 m s 1 was selected for further investigation 3 3 dcmd treating the petrochemical roc 3 3 1 experiments in full recirculation mode the treatment of the roc by dcmd with all membranes pe s pe o and ptfe t was accomplished in full recirculation mode at feeding temperature adjusted to 60 c and distillate tank temperature of 20 c as defined in section 3 2 fig 3 shows the normalised flux in relation to operating time using roc as the feed in full circulation mode in this mode the feed concentration was maintained a similar initial water vapour flux to the pure water feed fig 2 was observed for all membranes the pe o membrane presented the most stable performance as the flux behaviour remained stable for up to 210 h followed by a decline till the end of the test the end water vapour flux was 5 0 kg h 1 m 2 the pe o membrane was followed by the other pe membrane pe s a linear but slow decline in the water vapour flux was observed until a final water vapour flux of 2 1 kg h 1 m 2 after 250 h the ptfe t membrane showed a higher drop in water vapour flux at the beginning and further reduction until about 30 of the initial flux the results indicated that membranes made from more hydrophobic polymers that is presenting a higher contact angle table 1 tend to be fouled at a faster rate being these results in line with the ones found in the literature 57 although most of researches in this area have indicated ptfe membrane as the best choice for md intents it is still discussed whether just this membrane material is enough for a successful dcmd application 1 in this sense chen et al 58 investigated the functioning of ptfe flat sheet membrane during the dcmd process of modelled high salinity brines their results demonstrated that single layered ptfe flat membrane did show high water vapour flux but the respective performance was not steady a condition that could be explained by the salt deposition on the surface and in the pores jointly or separately which decreases the overall water vapour flux in brief these authors prepared and put together two pieces of ptfe double layered membrane where the extra layer would serve as a barrier for the membrane potential defects then a much longer stable md performance was observed whilst hydrophobic character of membrane allows an easy adsorption of organic materials onto its surface afterwards in a similar study when using md process to treat an effluent from mesophilic anaerobic moving bed biofilm reactor three different types of membranes were compared to each other made respectively of pp pvdf and ptfe 57 on this opportunity during experiments that lasted 45 h the ptfe membrane with higher hydrophobicity showed a higher permeability and fouling rate in comparison to the rest of the set in fact feed water foulants can be deposited on the hydrophobic membrane surface blocking its pores and decreasing the water vapour flux 59 and as was already showed on section 3 1 the organic compounds present on the roc are characterised by a high log kow from 4 to 14 what can cause adsorption to the hydrophobic md membrane see supplementary material table s1 along with that there is temperature which is one of the most dominant factors of organic and inorganic fouling in the matter of md membranes in such a way that it leads at higher degrees to a more intense concentration of both inorganic and organic compounds a condition that increases the temperature even more as well as the concentration polarisation by creating a slow moving layer of water at the surface of the membrane being able to make it hydrodynamically stagnant regarding this srisurichan et al 60 observed that the water vapour flux decline at higher temperatures was greater for solutions with organic compounds in the wastewater remarking there was a severe fouling at temperatures between 20 38 c moreover during md process a very common damage is the formation of a scale layer composed of insoluble salts e g caso4 mgco3 and caco3 on the membrane s top surface in contact with the feed 61 this kind of damage also implies either higher or lower flux than that of an intact membrane the lower one can be attributed to scale deposits on the surface blocking its pores 62 and the higher one is essentially due to pore wetting almost always followed by a lower salt rejection 61 pe s and ptfe t membranes were more affected by fouling and scaling using roc feed to exclude the influence of organic contaminants in the feed separate dcmd experiments were carried out in which binary synthetic solutions were used as feed including only inorganic salts e g sodium chloride calcium chloride sodium sulphate and magnesium sulphate see suplementary material fig s1 a similar decline in the water vapour flux was found in all the experiments regarding the distillate quality the average electrical conductivity of the produced water had a very low value around 2 Î¼s cm Â¹ in all experiments consequently the chemical analysis of distillate data not shown revealed the absence of ions as well as of organic matter toc meaning that dcmd could be successfully applied to treat the petrochemical roc in fact high rejection factors above 99 5 were achieved for all parameters which comply with most water reuse and recycling purposes 3 3 2 experiments in concentration mode fig 4 displays the normalised flux as a function of the wrr corresponding to 72 h of operating time all membranes evaluated in the treatment of roc by dcmd had satisfactory wrr reaching values above 75 and produced high quality distillates with electrical conductivity lower than 2 Î¼s cm 1 however the best results were found with the pe o membrane reaching 90 wrr dow et al 63 for example using a highly hydrophobic ptfe active membrane layer with nominal 0 5 Î¼m pore size bonded to a pp support supplied by ningbo chanqi china processed an effluent from a textile industry and obtained a water recovery of 91 6 at the end of their tests supporting the viability of a near zero liquid discharge as shown in fig 4 the pe o membrane performed the best showing extended stable water vapour flux for 52 h until a wrr of 75 decreasing by about 20 at a wrr of 80 and then presenting a sharp 50 decrease at the end of the test when a wrr of 90 was reached the pe s membrane showed a short period of stable water vapour flux for 10 h and the water vapour flux declined gradually until a wrr of 55 followed by a quick decline the ptfe t membrane indicated linear flux decline against the wrr the slight water vapour flux decreases presented by pe s and pe o membranes up to a wrr of 20 and 75 respectively may be addressed to concentration polarisation while the sharp decline observed from these points is probably related to the occurrence of fouling and or scaling on the other hand the ptfe t membrane exhibited a marked water vapour flux decay at the beginning of the tests from a wrr of 5 indicating its greater propensity to fouling and or scaling in fact the verified water vapour flux reduction is directly associated with the increase in wrr because there is a growth in solute concentration in the feed solution as the wrr increases including a more intense concentration polarisation effect on the membrane surface 48 it is well known that concentration polarisation is inherent to membrane processes being a precursor of membrane fouling 17 65 as a result fouling may cause membrane pore blockage reducing the water vapour flux intensifying the temperature polarisation and decreasing the membrane hydrophobicity 66 as the md feed water becomes more concentrated there is an increase in both the solution viscosity and thickness of the boundary layer adjacent to the membrane this condition will increase the mass and heat transfer resistances intensifying the temperature polarisation and also reducing the driving force across the membrane as well as the water vapour flux 27 67 in the present study for all membranes tested fig 5 the tpc increases with the volumetric concentration factor vcf which is the ratio between feed and concentrate volumes however the ptfe membrane showed higher tpc growth rates than pe membranes especially for a vcf greater than 3 representing a wrr greater than 60 this justifies why the ptfe showed a more pronounced drop in the water vapour fluxes on the other side pe o presented the lowest tpc growth rate as reported above water vapour flux is dependent on md feed concentration thus fig 6 displays the concentration values in the dcmd concentrate stream and the theoretical values that consider the mass balance based on the measured concentrations in the distillate and concentrate stream for most ions at different wrrs at a wrr of 60 vcf 3 the concentration of most ions chloride nitrate sulphate and sodium in the dcmd concentrate stream is similar to the theoretical values fig 6a except for calcium which presented a concentration 40 lower than the expected values indeed this gap between the quantity of ions in the dcmd concentrate stream and the theoretical values tends to increase with wrr at a wrr of 80 vcf 5 fig 6c one can observe that not only calcium and magnesium but also sulphate was found in lower values than the theoretical ones mainly for the ptfe t membrane therefore only a small concentration of ions was detected in the water vapour stream for any membrane see table 3 considering that the dcmd concentrate exhibited lower values than the theoretical ones these results may indicate the deposition of these ions on the membrane 60 explaining the water vapour flux decay similar to what was verified for the inorganic ions the toc in the dcmd concentrate increased with wrr but the values were always lower than the theoretical ones this relation analysed value theoretical value indicates that around 65 of the organic matter quantified as toc was possibly deposited as organic foulant onto the membranes 68 justifying the water vapour flux decline in addition no organic compounds detected in the qualitative analysis of the roc by gc ms presented previously in section 3 1 and in the supplementary material table s1 were found in the distillates of the three membranes studied thus they may have stayed in the dcmd concentrate or adhered to the fouling layer on the membranes on the other hand fouling organic or inorganic detected in dcmd experiments treating the roc was always reversible since a washing with deionised water was sufficient to restore the original water vapour flux the membrane cleaning procedure consists in circulating deionised water at 60 c for about 12 h in fig 7 is represented the evolution of water vapour flux during the cleaning it is important to highlight that in all tests no membrane presented evidence of wetting resulting in high quality distillates producing water with an average electrical conductivity as low as 2 Î¼s cm 1 consequently the chemical analysis of the distillate table 3 revealed a very low concentration of ions as well as organic matter toc meaning that dcmd could be successfully applied to treat the petrochemical roc under the conditions evaluated in the present work organic compounds hydrocarbons were not detected in the distillates but deeper investigation is still necessary which will be carried out in future works in fact high rejection factors above 99 5 were achieved for all parameters which comply with most water reuse and recycling purposes in the petrochemical industry 38 64 3 4 contact angle measurements contact angle measurements of the pe s pe o and ptfe t membranes were evaluated to identify the loss of its hydrophobicity fig 8 shows a the virgin membrane b the membrane after roc treatment in concentration mode and c the membrane after cleaning with deionised water through these images a hydrophobicity reduction for all membranes is clearly noted after treatment of the roc it is also possible to observe that the hydrophobicity was at least partially restored after cleaning as shown in fig 8 the ptfe t membrane presented the highest hydrophobicity but also a higher reduction after roc treatment regarding the pe s and pe o membranes a hydrophobicity reduction after roc treatment was also observed the hydrophobicity loss of these membranes can be interpreted as an effect of combined adhesion of organic and inorganic compounds which forms a layer of foulants according to many researchers 8 63 69 for real effluents which contain a combination of different dissolved contaminants like salts surfactants biomass etc the interaction between the membrane and such varied constituents inevitably leads to fouling scaling and loss of hydrophobicity in the present study it was found that the membrane made of ptfe was more susceptible to fouling and scaling than the ones made of pe pe s and pe o in almost all previously studied cases presented in the literature md systems were considered unsuitable for direct wastewater treatment mainly because of the early occurrences of scaling and loss of hydrophobicity at the start of the process otherwise in research by hull and zodrow 70 the high organic concentration of ro concentrate caused a significant reduction in membrane hydrophobicity which was attributed to the adhesion of low molar mass organic compounds in order to solve it a pre treatment with gac adsorption helped reduce the organic content of the ro concentrate by 46 50 ensuring high quality water production in md naidu et al 31 also advised that the ptfe membrane has a significantly faster loss of hydrophobicity especially when real ro concentrates are used as feed water in a concise explanation this is due to the combined adhesion of hydrophilic organic compounds and inorganics such as caco3 on the membrane in spite of cleaning with water and acid recovering the flow closest to its initial value the membrane flux still decreases faster after wetting dow et al 63 using raw textile effluent as feed water in a bench scale dcmd system with ptfe membranes also described a 60 drop in water vapour flux after around 2 5 h of tests in addition to an immediate wetting occurrence cheng et al 71 also found that the membrane in a flat sheet module made of ptfe was significantly prone to the mgcl2 and mgso4 incrustation in this study after washing with deionised water the membranes revealed hydrophobicity recovery regarding this goh et al 72 reiterate that cleaning the membranes with deionised water to remove scale deposits show some improvements in reducing wetting in md nevertheless suffering much fouling over time the membrane gradually loses its resistance to wetting considering that cleaning with deionised water does not fully restore its performance meanwhile dow et al 63 suggest that deionised water cleaning is more suitable for the removal of inorganic incrustations 3 5 sem and eds analysis to further verify the fouling pattern caused by roc constituents as well as the membrane morphology sem and eds analyses were carried out fig 9 shows sem images of the membrane surface evaluating the virgin membranes membranes after treatment of the roc with dcmd in concentration mode and membranes after cleaning with deionised water as can be seen in fig 9a virgin membranes the pe s and pe o membranes present similar morphology while the ptfe t is different which is associated with their production methods after the treatment of roc with dcmd in concentration mode a fouling layer on the surface of all three membranes was observed fig 9b with no evidence of the presence of salt crystals owing to secondary nucleation shin and sohn 73 stated that bulk crystallisation develops with flow rate but the surface crystallisation in its turn decreases with it which is associated with concentration polarisation in consequence implying a high fouling rate the flux decline at low flow rates is influenced by surface crystallisation as well as bulk crystallisation recent research showed that organic matter such as humic acid acts as a binding agent for inorganic material such as calcium thereby inhibiting the growth of crystals 31 in this sense the md feed water had 31 mg l 1 of toc which may have inhibited crystal growth on the other hand after cleaning with deionised water fig 9c the membranes were restored to their initial conditions without any fouling the eds analyses displayed in fig 10 further confirm the results from the sem analyses fig 9 where all membranes showed similar behaviour although the formation of crystals has not been observed in sem analyses eds showed the presence of a large number of elements deposited on the surface of all membranes after roc treatment with si al mg zn and p being the elements that showed the highest intensity peaks fig 10a as reported by zhang et al 74 under certain conditions si can be a problem working in conditions favouring the incidence of temperature and concentration polarisation results in lower temperature and a higher concentration of dissolved silica close to the membrane surface potentially promoting silica supersaturation causing colloidal amorphous silica precipitation this is enhanced in the presence of multivalent cations such as ca2 and mg2 which favour the polymerisation of silica increasing fouling incidence yin et al 2 investigated the effects of membrane surface wettability on silica scaling in md comparing the performance of three pvdf membranes with varied surface wettability which revealed the underlying scaling mechanism with an initially under saturated feed solution saturation index 0 82 the water vapour fluxes of all the tested membranes remained relatively stable during the experiments despite the formation of silica scale likely due to heterogeneous nucleation with a supersaturated feed solution saturation index 0 55 all the membranes experienced a dramatic reduction of water vapour flux which started at almost the same time regardless of membrane materials microscopic observation of the scale layer morphology along with the comparison between silica scaling and colloidal silica fouling provided explicit evidence that homogenous nucleation was not the exclusive scaling mechanism and indicated that the interaction of silica particles deposited on the membrane with soluble silica species in the feedwater facilitated the water vapour flux decline accordingly a four step mechanism was proposed for silica scaling in md involving both homogenous and heterogeneous nucleation as a result hydrophilic coating or a superhydrophobic surface with a slippery characteristic in this study was unable to markedly mitigate silica scaling in md further the scale layer formed under high silica concentration exhibited a compact and gel like morphology which completely covered the membrane surface and was likely responsible for the dramatic water vapour flux decline during the dcmd experiments under both silica concentrations the electrical conductivity of the distillate stream remained unchanged throughout the dcmd experiments indicating that membrane wetting did not occur regardless of silica concentrations present in the feed water or the water vapour flux behaviours of the tested membranes in other experiments christie et al 75 comparing gypsum and silica scaling in md determined different scaling kinetics as a result of slower rate of silicic acid polymerisation than that of gypsum crystallisation besides the authors also observed that after gypsum scaling the surface of the pvdf membrane was covered by gypsum crystals while after silica scaling the membrane surface showed an amorphous feature their experimental results also suggest that pore wetting resulted from gypsum scaling but not from silica scaling as a result these facts suggest that silica of the most probable causes of fouling in the present study the eds results fig 10 also show the presence of mg and ca on the membrane after treatment of the roc this is in line with the data reported in fig 11 where it is shown that with the used feed composition in terms of calcium magnesium and sulphate magnesium and calcium sulphates will occur in the dcmd concentrate on the other hand after cleaning with deionised water the water vapour fluxes were always restored close to their initial values for all membranes which is supported by eds analyses from membranes after cleaning fig 10b where a minor quantity and intensity of peaks were observed demonstrating the effectiveness of cleaning with deionised water 4 conclusions all the membranes evaluated in dcmd treatment demonstrated satisfactory wrrs achieving values close to 90 and high rejection factors above 99 5 for all parameters the membranes made of pe presented higher water vapour fluxes than the one made of ptfe the oleophobic membrane from aquastil pe o presented the best performance with a low water vapour flux decline even with a wrr of 90 taking these results into account by integrating ro with dcmd using the membrane with the best performance i e pe o the global wrr was as high as 95 confirming that md is doubtlessly an appropriate process that can be integrated with ro to enhance global water recovery and to reduce the volume of concentrate discharged approaching the concept of zero liquid discharge nevertheless membrane characteristics are very important for minimising the occurrence of fouling and scaling maintaining a high flux for longer periods and thus enabling the application of the dcmd process in the

13725,the present study investigated the applicability of direct contact membrane distillation dcmd in the treatment of a reverse osmosis concentrate roc from petrochemical wastewater three commercial flat sheet membranes made of polyethylene or polytetrafluoroethylene having different contact angles pore sizes porosities and thicknesses were supplied by aquastill with the following membrane designation standard oleophobic and teflon firstly the different dcmd membranes were characterised in experiments with deionised water then tests with roc with a temperature setting to 60 c in the feed and 20 c on the distillate side were performed in full recirculation mode along 250 h operating time and in concentration mode along 72 h operating time achieving volumetric concentration factors around 10 the dcmd performance in terms of flux and quality of the distillate was evaluated during all experiments under different operating conditions after obtaining the results all membranes satisfactorily achieved a final water recovery ratio close to 90 as well as high rejection factors above 99 5 for all parameters analysed they also produced high quality water with low electrical conductivity around 2 7 Î¼s cm 1 all conditions met the requirements for water reuse in the petrochemical sector in this case to treat wastewater with the tested characteristics the oleophobic membrane from aquastill presented better efficiency with a minimum water vapour flux reduction and a water recovery ratio of 90 keywords petrochemical wastewater reverse osmosis reverse osmosis concentrate direct contact membrane distillation 1 introduction it is known that membrane separation processes typically used for wastewater treatment include microfiltration mf ultrafiltration uf nanofiltration nf reverse osmosis ro or electrodialysis ed and most of these are pressure driven technologies using the pressure difference as driving force but the hydraulic pressure difference as the mass transfer driving force has its own disadvantages one of them is the osmotic pressure limitation 1 especially when treating hypersaline wastewater through ro processes a difficulty that does not occur with membrane distillation md whose prevalent tolerance to high salinity renders it a suitable technology to treat wastewater such as concentrated ro brines 2 the huge amount of concentrate that results from the ro process when this technology is used to produce drinking water and also for wastewater treatment 3 4 is still a matter to the development of processes aiming at water reuse the reverse osmosis concentrate roc may contain persistent pollutants both organic and inorganic as well as noxious factors therefore proper roc management has been a significant concern in the practice of water recovery that is why the inefficient disposal of that derivative is extremely noxious to the environment causing an expressive loss of water resources must of all 5 6 a situation that claims for a totally integrated effluent treatment including the roc to the water cycle and henceforth preventing any risk of contamination 3 among different technologies being studied to mitigate the environmental impact caused by the discharge of roc md is one of the best ways to treat high salinity solutions such as roc reaching elevated levels of water recuperation 7 8 among different md processes direct contact membrane distillation dcmd has been largely studied as described in previous studies from swaminathan et al 9 10 dcmd is a very efficient configuration of md in which a microporous and hydrophobic membrane is in direct contact with both a hot feed and a cooler distillate basically water evaporates on the feed side of the md membrane s pores and condenses on the distillate side the vapour pressure difference across the membrane is the driving force which results from the temperature gradient in the boundary layers contiguous to the membrane surface 11 15 of all the particular md arrangements in this work dcmd was selected to perform the experiments in this system the membrane is in contact with liquid on both sides and the flux of water from the feed bulk toward the membrane drags with it dissolved solutes suspended solids and microbes which can accumulate near the membrane surface forming a fouling layer and degrading membrane performance these phenomena are strongly associated with the incoming md feed water quality and can lead to membrane wetting reducing the distillate quality 16 19 often in the high salinity wastewater recuperation fouling and wetting of membranes are expressive concerns that can obstruct a more disseminated application of md technology indeed caused by inconvenient materials that accumulate on the membrane surface and pores fouling induces a decrease in water vapour flux while the membrane wetting the direct permeation of the feed solution through the membrane pores results in reduced contaminant rejection and overall process failure 20 basically the membrane properties such as pore size porosity thickness liquid entry pressure lep and type of material influence all the process and its efficiency 21 22 on the whole the thermal and solution concentration as well as the module characteristics constitute the main processes and operating variables none the less by creating fouling situations it is known that constituents of feed solutions certain ions organics etc and its ph can also affect the process stability 23 anyway md is considered a unique process by which the desalination of hypersaline streams for example can be achieved but several transport phenomena may restrain the water vapour flux through the membranes under use including the decrease in partial vapour pressure and specifically across the layers the heat and mass transfer resistance in the same way as concentration and temperature polarisations or loss in heat transfer 24 25 in different circumstances md has been also presented for recovery of valuable salts from effluents nowadays studies regarding md treating roc mainly address seawater roc having high salinity and low organic matter content 26 29 besides seawater roc studies md has also been used to treat wastewater having other physicochemical characteristics yu et al 30 employed dcmd to treat cooling tower blowdown water which was mainly composed of inorganic material presenting total dissolved solids tds of 4 75 g l 1 naidu et al 31 evaluated dcmd treating roc from biologically treated sewage combined with storm water from sydney olympic park this roc was characterised by low contents of tds 1 49 g l 1 and turbidity 0 11 ntu but approximately 60 mg l 1 of dissolved organic carbon doc as well as micropollutants before md tests the roc was pre treated with granular activated carbon gac to reduce doc and micropollutants contents and thus minimise organic and inorganic fouling incidence despite these wastewater treatment studies there is still a gap on research addressing md treating petrochemical roc which in turn has a different composition from other md feed water in a previous work 32 tertiary petrochemical wastewater was treated by ro resulting in a roc with 1 1 g l 1 of tds and 23 mg l 1 of chemical oxygen demand cod as well as organic compounds from the petrochemical process further treatment of this roc by md may allow water recovery in fact studies concerning petrochemical wastewater treatment aiming water recovery by md were conducted by santos et al 33 in their study the petrochemical wastewater was treated by an electrodialysis reversal edr pilot plant and the authors have analysed the possible dcmd application with ptfe pp membranes employing a pretreatment filtration method the drop in water vapour flow rate was minimised by 30 and the rate of water recovery increased from 56 to 75 in comparison with the test carried out without pretreatment thanks to the high rejection of pollutants the researchers concluded that the physical chemical condition of water recovered by edr dcmd enables it to be reused mostly in these specific industrial processes other authors 34 have conducted a study with a solution prepared in the laboratory to mimic an oily wastewater at this work the application of an integrated fo md system for sustainable water reuse from oily wastewater with relatively high salinity is proposed and investigated the hybrid fo md system has demonstrated a water recovery of 90 in the present study the tertiary petrochemical wastewater firstly concentrated by ro 32 was further treated by dcmd aiming at higher water recovery the md performance in terms of water vapour flux and distillate quality was investigated with three different commercial membranes and related to their characteristics i e thickness pore size porosity and contact angle and with the operating parameters including feed velocity temperature and concentration the main objective is to enhance the practical use of dcmd determining the best conditions for water recovery from a real petrochemical roc on account of this in addition to the study of their propensity for fouling incidence from supersaturated roc solution an additional benefit to this approach it was studied the direct contact membrane distillation dcmd in treating a real petrochemical roc without any pretreatment 2 materials and methods the present study was performed for the treatment of a roc by a md process as represented in the experimental setup of fig 1 2 1 roc characterisation for the proposed study the roc was obtained after the treatment of petrochemical wastewater in a ro pilot system in the petrochemical industry the conventional wastewater treatment plant has primary secondary and tertiary treatments as described elsewhere 32 35 after the tertiary treatment the wastewater was collected and sent to the ro pilot system which was operated under the optimal conditions and using the same membrane employed in a previous study 32 after treatment with ro samples of the permeate and concentrate were collected for physicochemical characterisation and the roc was directly used as feed water on the dcmd 2 2 dcmd 2 2 1 membranes in this work three commercial microporous hydrophobic flat sheet membranes supplied by aquastill were used a polytetrafluoroethylene based ptfe and two polyethylene pe based pe s pe o both pe membranes present similar caracteristics however the second one pe o has relatively low porosity and higher contact angle compared to the first one pe s the details of both pe membrane production were provided by aquastill both membranes are produced based on uhmwpe ultra high molecular weigth polyethylene that is hydrophobic by nature however for some applications it is needed that the membrane is oleophobic via an external company the base membrane is treated using vacuum plasma deposition with a eptfe like material not disclosed by the company and in this way the morphology of the base membrane is more or less preserved while a thin layer of eptfe like material is deposited on all external surfaces inside the membrane in this way the base membranes can be functionalized regarding the contact angle for the oleophobic material the contact angle is higher than 118 additionally the surface tension is smaller than 18 dynes cm 1 iso 8296 2003 and n heptane will not penetrate the oleophobic membrane aatcc tm 118 summarised in table 1 the three membranes main characteristics were supplied by aquastill 2 2 2 operating procedure in fig 1 is illustrated the bench scale dcmd equipment used in the present study basically the system has an acrylic cell with a depth width and length of 1 0 9 5 and 13 8 cm respectively the feeding tank was supplied with 5 l of solution deionised water synthetic solution or roc in the distillate 1 l of deionised water with an electrical conductivity of 2 Î¼s cm 1 was circulated on the cold stream which was adjusted to a temperature of 20 c with an accuracy of 0 5 c besides that two temperature sensors were instaled on both tanks distillate and feed and two other sensors were instaled near both sides of the membrane surfaces further in counter current mode accomplished by circulating pumps the feed and distillate flows were channelled into the acrylic cell at a tangential velocity of 0 02 m s 1 the distillate reservoir allowed the excess distillate to overflow into a collection vessel which was weighed continuously on an analytical balance being the distillate mass recorded on a computer as represented in fig 1 thus the water vapour mass flux j in kg h Â¹ m 2 was calculated using eq 1 1 j Î´ m a x Î´ t where Î´m is the mass of water vapour or distillate kg a is the effective membrane area m2 and Î´t h is the permeation time in order to check the decline of the water vapour flux over the operation time the normalised flux i e the ratio between the water vapour flux at time t j and the initial time j 0 was evaluated to characterise the membranes dcmd experiments were carried out first using deionised water at different feed temperatures t f 50 60 and 70 c maintaining a constant distillate temperature t d at 20 c after that the roc was treated by dcmd at a moderate feed temperature of 60 c with the permeate kept at 20 c the rejection efficiency r was determined as 2 r 1 c d c f 100 where c f mg l 1 is the concentration in the feed and c d mg l 1 is the concentration on the distillate tests were performed in full recirculation mode where concentrate and distillate after weighed streams are recirculated to the feed tank to study the variation in the water vapour fluxes and in the solute rejections as a function of the operating conditions in these tests small samples representing less than 5 of the feed solution were collected at the beginning and end of each assay for physicochemical characterisation ph conductivity total organic carbon toc and ion chromatography analysis these experiments were carried out to assess the performance of the membranes in long term tests of about 250 h in addition tests in concentration mode where the distillate is collected separately as the concentrate stream recirculates to the feed tank were conducted to evaluate the water vapour flux solute rejection and temperature polarisation coefficient tpc as a function of the water recovery ratio wrr using eqs 3 and 4 3 t p c t f m t d m t f t d and 4 w r r v d v f x 100 where t f m and t d m are the temperatures at membrane surfaces for the feed and distillate while t f and t d are the bulk temperatures on the feed and distillate sides respectively v f and v d are the feed and distillate volumes respectively here at different wrr distillate and concentrate samples were collected for physicochemical characterisation ph conductivity toc and ion chromatography analysis after collection the samples were stored under refrigeration at 4 c and re established at room temperature 20 25 c before being analysed in general these contents were examined within 4 days of collection but when their storage exceeded this time they were preventively frozen at 20 c until they could be evaluated after finishing each test the membranes were cleaned by circulating deionised water at 60 c and at the tangential velocity of 0 02 m s 1 deionised water was flowed until a stable flux was reached with no subsequent increment which was considered the restored water vapour flux value in all experiments it took about 12 h to water vapour flux stabilisation besides the roc treatment binary synthetic solutions were also evaluated the main inorganic salts identified in the real effluent from the petrochemical industry are the elements na ca mg so4 and cl among other salts that have also been identified but in lesser concentration in this sense four types of synthetic binary solutions 2 g l 1 of nacl mgcl2 cacl2 or na2so4 were prepared and treated by dcmd in order to favour the understanding of the fouling behaviour in the membranes 2 3 analytical methods the ph and conductivity of the samples were measured using azph and phtek portable meters respectively analyses of ions and toc were performed in the distillate and concentrate samples by ionic chromatography and catalytic combustion respectively as described elsewhere 36 qualitative analysis for organic compounds present in roc and distillate samples obtained in concentration mode with the three membranes was performed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms with a qp2010 from shimadzu in the scanning range of 35 400 u through comparison with data from the nist ms 2008 library the membranes hydrophobicity was monitored by measuring the water contact angle samples of each membrane virgin after roc treatment and after cleaning with deionised water 2 4 cm in size were taken and stored in a becker with deionised water they were then stirred at 120 rpm for 5 h and air dried prior to analysis the contact angle was measured by the sessile drop method employing a goniometer phoenix mini where 1 8 2 0 Î¼l of milli q water was carefully dropped onto the membrane surface this procedure was performed in five different positions for each membrane sample taking the average value as the contact angle scanning electron microscopy sem analyses with an image acquisition system jsm model 6510 l v were also carried out to evaluate the morphology of the membrane surfaces x ray energy dispersion spectroscopy eds thermo scientific model 6742a 1ues sn analyses were also performed for information on the chemical composition of the fouling layer 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristic of the roc to feed the ro wastewater treated by the petrochemical industry was used in its most essential characteristic the petrochemical wastewater is a complex composition containing oil emulsifiers fatty acids bactericides corrosion inhibitors and many other chemicals among them detergents and surfactants possibly also present could reduce the value of surface tension diminishing the quality of the product 37 besides that as md employs hydrophobic membranes to treat and recover fresh water it is plausible the occurrence of fouling due to high hydrophobic contaminants maybe present in feed water like oil or hydrophobic organic material precisely because of the strong hydrophobic hydrophobic interaction 20 therefore accordingly to han et al 8 the presence of oil intensify the fouling activity through hydrophobic hydrophobic interaction with membrane surface and pores however the presence of only oil in feed water sometimes led to higher fouling and pronounced flux decline insofar as the affinity between the hydrophobic species that is to say the oil itself to the hydrophobic md membrane is higher the characteristics of the petrochemical wastewater ro permeate and roc are presented in table 2 where it is possible to observe that the ro rejection efficiency was higher than 90 for all evaluated parameters these results also show that the permeate characteristics are within the criteria established by the petrochemical industry for water reuse in cooling towers 38 the roc was used as md feed water although presenting low organic content in terms of cod and toc which can also be attributed to the presence of humic substances generated in the biological treatment 39 a qualitative characterisation of the roc showed that this organic matter is associated with 16 organic compounds typical of the petrochemical process 3 eicosene 1 2 benzenedicarboxylic acid bis 2 methylpropyl ester 2 heptadecanone 1 heptadecene n hexadecanoic acid heptasiloxane 1 1 3 3 5 5 7 7 9 9 11 11 13 13 tetradecamethyl octadecanoic acid 1 nonadecene hexanedioic acid bis 2 ethylhexyl ester heneicosane di n octyl phthalate 9 octadecenamide z decanedioic acid bis 2 ethylhexyl ester eicosane 1 iodo squalene and nonacosane these compounds are characterised by presenting low surface tension from 27 to 36 dyn cm 1 what could induce membrane pore wetting and high log kow from 4 to 14 what can cause adsorption to the hydrophobic md membrane see supplementary material table s1 according to tonini et al 40 the detected hydrocarbons are typical of wastewater from petrochemical industries the petrochemical industry in question produces first generation products using petrochemical naphtha as the main raw material 41 the light fraction of naphtha is rich in paraffinic or alkane compounds being used for the production of olefins alkenes alkadienes or dienes 41 43 the compounds identified in the present work have already been classified by jorfi et al 44 as predominant by products of the degradation of petroleum products commonly found in this type of environment according to klauck 45 1 nonadecene is used in lubricants and fuel additives among the identified peaks the one that stood out the most by intensity was the di n octyl phthalate compound zhu et al 46 reported that phthalate esters are among persistent organic pollutants most frequently detected in the environment and according to gao and wen 47 are used in the manufacturing and processing of plastic products 3 2 characterisation of md membranes effect of feed temperature and flow velocity on water vapour distillate flux to optimise the dcmd performance the effect of both feed temperature and flow velocity were investigated as shown in fig 2 fig 2a shows the water vapour flux variation with feed temperature 50 60 and 70 c when pure water was used as feed for the three tested membranes which have different pore sizes materials thicknesses and porosity the distillate temperature was kept constant at 20 c the md water vapour fluxes for all membranes followed the increase of the feed temperature the water vapour flux doubled by increasing the feed temperature from 50 to 70 c which is related to the increase in the water vapour pressure following an arrhenius type dependence with temperature 21 48 from the antoine equation the vapour pressure at the liquid vapour interface will exponentially increase with temperature enhancing the driving force 49 the three tested membranes showed reasonable dcmd water vapour fluxes the ptfe t membrane which had the greatest hydrophobicity and smallest thickness showed the highest water vapour flux other authors have also reported that the water vapour flux is inversely proportional to membrane thickness 1 50 then pe s and pe o membranes which are made of pe presented the same behaviour when the influence of feed temperature on the water vapour fluxes was evaluated in addition a higher feed temperature is beneficial reducing the feed solution viscosity and therefore decreasing the mass and heat transfer boundary layer thickness on the other hand some studies have shown that inorganic and organic fouling may increase with feed temperature 1 31 water evaporation and temperature increase create supersaturation on the feed side that leads to nucleation and crystallisation in the feed and on the membrane surface resulting in inorganic fouling mainly considering that the solubility of individual salts may be positively or negatively correlated with temperature 20 23 about organic fouling at higher temperatures water vapor flux increases on md and this may lead to higher concentration of organic compounds at the membrane interface due to the concentration polarisation effect 23 therefore in the present study the feed temperature was set at 60 c an intermediate temperature in order to minimise the incidence of fouling fig 2b shows that the water vapour flux increased with feed velocity for all membranes the water vapour flux is closely related to fluid dynamics so it can be improved by increasing the feed velocity 51 as the flow velocity increased to about 0 01 m s 1 the water vapour flux showed a plateau despite this in the following tests with roc the highest feed velocity 0 02 m s 1 which corresponds to the maximum capacity of the pumps 1 4 l min 1 was selected to minimise the possible concentration polarisation effects this would reduce the boundary layer thickness and increase the mass and heat transfer coefficients and consequently would decrease temperature and concentration polarisation 52 chen et al 53 also reported the boundary layer resistance minimisation at an increased flow rate leads towards enhanced mass transfer by increasing the heat transfer coefficient the enhancement in flow rate results in high water vapour flux due to the reduced thermal boundary layer thickness and reduces temperature polarisation effects both asymptotic 51 54 and linear 55 56 relationships between water vapour flux and feed velocity were reported by balancing the pump energy and water vapour flux a feed flow velocity of 0 02 m s 1 was selected for further investigation 3 3 dcmd treating the petrochemical roc 3 3 1 experiments in full recirculation mode the treatment of the roc by dcmd with all membranes pe s pe o and ptfe t was accomplished in full recirculation mode at feeding temperature adjusted to 60 c and distillate tank temperature of 20 c as defined in section 3 2 fig 3 shows the normalised flux in relation to operating time using roc as the feed in full circulation mode in this mode the feed concentration was maintained a similar initial water vapour flux to the pure water feed fig 2 was observed for all membranes the pe o membrane presented the most stable performance as the flux behaviour remained stable for up to 210 h followed by a decline till the end of the test the end water vapour flux was 5 0 kg h 1 m 2 the pe o membrane was followed by the other pe membrane pe s a linear but slow decline in the water vapour flux was observed until a final water vapour flux of 2 1 kg h 1 m 2 after 250 h the ptfe t membrane showed a higher drop in water vapour flux at the beginning and further reduction until about 30 of the initial flux the results indicated that membranes made from more hydrophobic polymers that is presenting a higher contact angle table 1 tend to be fouled at a faster rate being these results in line with the ones found in the literature 57 although most of researches in this area have indicated ptfe membrane as the best choice for md intents it is still discussed whether just this membrane material is enough for a successful dcmd application 1 in this sense chen et al 58 investigated the functioning of ptfe flat sheet membrane during the dcmd process of modelled high salinity brines their results demonstrated that single layered ptfe flat membrane did show high water vapour flux but the respective performance was not steady a condition that could be explained by the salt deposition on the surface and in the pores jointly or separately which decreases the overall water vapour flux in brief these authors prepared and put together two pieces of ptfe double layered membrane where the extra layer would serve as a barrier for the membrane potential defects then a much longer stable md performance was observed whilst hydrophobic character of membrane allows an easy adsorption of organic materials onto its surface afterwards in a similar study when using md process to treat an effluent from mesophilic anaerobic moving bed biofilm reactor three different types of membranes were compared to each other made respectively of pp pvdf and ptfe 57 on this opportunity during experiments that lasted 45 h the ptfe membrane with higher hydrophobicity showed a higher permeability and fouling rate in comparison to the rest of the set in fact feed water foulants can be deposited on the hydrophobic membrane surface blocking its pores and decreasing the water vapour flux 59 and as was already showed on section 3 1 the organic compounds present on the roc are characterised by a high log kow from 4 to 14 what can cause adsorption to the hydrophobic md membrane see supplementary material table s1 along with that there is temperature which is one of the most dominant factors of organic and inorganic fouling in the matter of md membranes in such a way that it leads at higher degrees to a more intense concentration of both inorganic and organic compounds a condition that increases the temperature even more as well as the concentration polarisation by creating a slow moving layer of water at the surface of the membrane being able to make it hydrodynamically stagnant regarding this srisurichan et al 60 observed that the water vapour flux decline at higher temperatures was greater for solutions with organic compounds in the wastewater remarking there was a severe fouling at temperatures between 20 38 c moreover during md process a very common damage is the formation of a scale layer composed of insoluble salts e g caso4 mgco3 and caco3 on the membrane s top surface in contact with the feed 61 this kind of damage also implies either higher or lower flux than that of an intact membrane the lower one can be attributed to scale deposits on the surface blocking its pores 62 and the higher one is essentially due to pore wetting almost always followed by a lower salt rejection 61 pe s and ptfe t membranes were more affected by fouling and scaling using roc feed to exclude the influence of organic contaminants in the feed separate dcmd experiments were carried out in which binary synthetic solutions were used as feed including only inorganic salts e g sodium chloride calcium chloride sodium sulphate and magnesium sulphate see suplementary material fig s1 a similar decline in the water vapour flux was found in all the experiments regarding the distillate quality the average electrical conductivity of the produced water had a very low value around 2 Î¼s cm Â¹ in all experiments consequently the chemical analysis of distillate data not shown revealed the absence of ions as well as of organic matter toc meaning that dcmd could be successfully applied to treat the petrochemical roc in fact high rejection factors above 99 5 were achieved for all parameters which comply with most water reuse and recycling purposes 3 3 2 experiments in concentration mode fig 4 displays the normalised flux as a function of the wrr corresponding to 72 h of operating time all membranes evaluated in the treatment of roc by dcmd had satisfactory wrr reaching values above 75 and produced high quality distillates with electrical conductivity lower than 2 Î¼s cm 1 however the best results were found with the pe o membrane reaching 90 wrr dow et al 63 for example using a highly hydrophobic ptfe active membrane layer with nominal 0 5 Î¼m pore size bonded to a pp support supplied by ningbo chanqi china processed an effluent from a textile industry and obtained a water recovery of 91 6 at the end of their tests supporting the viability of a near zero liquid discharge as shown in fig 4 the pe o membrane performed the best showing extended stable water vapour flux for 52 h until a wrr of 75 decreasing by about 20 at a wrr of 80 and then presenting a sharp 50 decrease at the end of the test when a wrr of 90 was reached the pe s membrane showed a short period of stable water vapour flux for 10 h and the water vapour flux declined gradually until a wrr of 55 followed by a quick decline the ptfe t membrane indicated linear flux decline against the wrr the slight water vapour flux decreases presented by pe s and pe o membranes up to a wrr of 20 and 75 respectively may be addressed to concentration polarisation while the sharp decline observed from these points is probably related to the occurrence of fouling and or scaling on the other hand the ptfe t membrane exhibited a marked water vapour flux decay at the beginning of the tests from a wrr of 5 indicating its greater propensity to fouling and or scaling in fact the verified water vapour flux reduction is directly associated with the increase in wrr because there is a growth in solute concentration in the feed solution as the wrr increases including a more intense concentration polarisation effect on the membrane surface 48 it is well known that concentration polarisation is inherent to membrane processes being a precursor of membrane fouling 17 65 as a result fouling may cause membrane pore blockage reducing the water vapour flux intensifying the temperature polarisation and decreasing the membrane hydrophobicity 66 as the md feed water becomes more concentrated there is an increase in both the solution viscosity and thickness of the boundary layer adjacent to the membrane this condition will increase the mass and heat transfer resistances intensifying the temperature polarisation and also reducing the driving force across the membrane as well as the water vapour flux 27 67 in the present study for all membranes tested fig 5 the tpc increases with the volumetric concentration factor vcf which is the ratio between feed and concentrate volumes however the ptfe membrane showed higher tpc growth rates than pe membranes especially for a vcf greater than 3 representing a wrr greater than 60 this justifies why the ptfe showed a more pronounced drop in the water vapour fluxes on the other side pe o presented the lowest tpc growth rate as reported above water vapour flux is dependent on md feed concentration thus fig 6 displays the concentration values in the dcmd concentrate stream and the theoretical values that consider the mass balance based on the measured concentrations in the distillate and concentrate stream for most ions at different wrrs at a wrr of 60 vcf 3 the concentration of most ions chloride nitrate sulphate and sodium in the dcmd concentrate stream is similar to the theoretical values fig 6a except for calcium which presented a concentration 40 lower than the expected values indeed this gap between the quantity of ions in the dcmd concentrate stream and the theoretical values tends to increase with wrr at a wrr of 80 vcf 5 fig 6c one can observe that not only calcium and magnesium but also sulphate was found in lower values than the theoretical ones mainly for the ptfe t membrane therefore only a small concentration of ions was detected in the water vapour stream for any membrane see table 3 considering that the dcmd concentrate exhibited lower values than the theoretical ones these results may indicate the deposition of these ions on the membrane 60 explaining the water vapour flux decay similar to what was verified for the inorganic ions the toc in the dcmd concentrate increased with wrr but the values were always lower than the theoretical ones this relation analysed value theoretical value indicates that around 65 of the organic matter quantified as toc was possibly deposited as organic foulant onto the membranes 68 justifying the water vapour flux decline in addition no organic compounds detected in the qualitative analysis of the roc by gc ms presented previously in section 3 1 and in the supplementary material table s1 were found in the distillates of the three membranes studied thus they may have stayed in the dcmd concentrate or adhered to the fouling layer on the membranes on the other hand fouling organic or inorganic detected in dcmd experiments treating the roc was always reversible since a washing with deionised water was sufficient to restore the original water vapour flux the membrane cleaning procedure consists in circulating deionised water at 60 c for about 12 h in fig 7 is represented the evolution of water vapour flux during the cleaning it is important to highlight that in all tests no membrane presented evidence of wetting resulting in high quality distillates producing water with an average electrical conductivity as low as 2 Î¼s cm 1 consequently the chemical analysis of the distillate table 3 revealed a very low concentration of ions as well as organic matter toc meaning that dcmd could be successfully applied to treat the petrochemical roc under the conditions evaluated in the present work organic compounds hydrocarbons were not detected in the distillates but deeper investigation is still necessary which will be carried out in future works in fact high rejection factors above 99 5 were achieved for all parameters which comply with most water reuse and recycling purposes in the petrochemical industry 38 64 3 4 contact angle measurements contact angle measurements of the pe s pe o and ptfe t membranes were evaluated to identify the loss of its hydrophobicity fig 8 shows a the virgin membrane b the membrane after roc treatment in concentration mode and c the membrane after cleaning with deionised water through these images a hydrophobicity reduction for all membranes is clearly noted after treatment of the roc it is also possible to observe that the hydrophobicity was at least partially restored after cleaning as shown in fig 8 the ptfe t membrane presented the highest hydrophobicity but also a higher reduction after roc treatment regarding the pe s and pe o membranes a hydrophobicity reduction after roc treatment was also observed the hydrophobicity loss of these membranes can be interpreted as an effect of combined adhesion of organic and inorganic compounds which forms a layer of foulants according to many researchers 8 63 69 for real effluents which contain a combination of different dissolved contaminants like salts surfactants biomass etc the interaction between the membrane and such varied constituents inevitably leads to fouling scaling and loss of hydrophobicity in the present study it was found that the membrane made of ptfe was more susceptible to fouling and scaling than the ones made of pe pe s and pe o in almost all previously studied cases presented in the literature md systems were considered unsuitable for direct wastewater treatment mainly because of the early occurrences of scaling and loss of hydrophobicity at the start of the process otherwise in research by hull and zodrow 70 the high organic concentration of ro concentrate caused a significant reduction in membrane hydrophobicity which was attributed to the adhesion of low molar mass organic compounds in order to solve it a pre treatment with gac adsorption helped reduce the organic content of the ro concentrate by 46 50 ensuring high quality water production in md naidu et al 31 also advised that the ptfe membrane has a significantly faster loss of hydrophobicity especially when real ro concentrates are used as feed water in a concise explanation this is due to the combined adhesion of hydrophilic organic compounds and inorganics such as caco3 on the membrane in spite of cleaning with water and acid recovering the flow closest to its initial value the membrane flux still decreases faster after wetting dow et al 63 using raw textile effluent as feed water in a bench scale dcmd system with ptfe membranes also described a 60 drop in water vapour flux after around 2 5 h of tests in addition to an immediate wetting occurrence cheng et al 71 also found that the membrane in a flat sheet module made of ptfe was significantly prone to the mgcl2 and mgso4 incrustation in this study after washing with deionised water the membranes revealed hydrophobicity recovery regarding this goh et al 72 reiterate that cleaning the membranes with deionised water to remove scale deposits show some improvements in reducing wetting in md nevertheless suffering much fouling over time the membrane gradually loses its resistance to wetting considering that cleaning with deionised water does not fully restore its performance meanwhile dow et al 63 suggest that deionised water cleaning is more suitable for the removal of inorganic incrustations 3 5 sem and eds analysis to further verify the fouling pattern caused by roc constituents as well as the membrane morphology sem and eds analyses were carried out fig 9 shows sem images of the membrane surface evaluating the virgin membranes membranes after treatment of the roc with dcmd in concentration mode and membranes after cleaning with deionised water as can be seen in fig 9a virgin membranes the pe s and pe o membranes present similar morphology while the ptfe t is different which is associated with their production methods after the treatment of roc with dcmd in concentration mode a fouling layer on the surface of all three membranes was observed fig 9b with no evidence of the presence of salt crystals owing to secondary nucleation shin and sohn 73 stated that bulk crystallisation develops with flow rate but the surface crystallisation in its turn decreases with it which is associated with concentration polarisation in consequence implying a high fouling rate the flux decline at low flow rates is influenced by surface crystallisation as well as bulk crystallisation recent research showed that organic matter such as humic acid acts as a binding agent for inorganic material such as calcium thereby inhibiting the growth of crystals 31 in this sense the md feed water had 31 mg l 1 of toc which may have inhibited crystal growth on the other hand after cleaning with deionised water fig 9c the membranes were restored to their initial conditions without any fouling the eds analyses displayed in fig 10 further confirm the results from the sem analyses fig 9 where all membranes showed similar behaviour although the formation of crystals has not been observed in sem analyses eds showed the presence of a large number of elements deposited on the surface of all membranes after roc treatment with si al mg zn and p being the elements that showed the highest intensity peaks fig 10a as reported by zhang et al 74 under certain conditions si can be a problem working in conditions favouring the incidence of temperature and concentration polarisation results in lower temperature and a higher concentration of dissolved silica close to the membrane surface potentially promoting silica supersaturation causing colloidal amorphous silica precipitation this is enhanced in the presence of multivalent cations such as ca2 and mg2 which favour the polymerisation of silica increasing fouling incidence yin et al 2 investigated the effects of membrane surface wettability on silica scaling in md comparing the performance of three pvdf membranes with varied surface wettability which revealed the underlying scaling mechanism with an initially under saturated feed solution saturation index 0 82 the water vapour fluxes of all the tested membranes remained relatively stable during the experiments despite the formation of silica scale likely due to heterogeneous nucleation with a supersaturated feed solution saturation index 0 55 all the membranes experienced a dramatic reduction of water vapour flux which started at almost the same time regardless of membrane materials microscopic observation of the scale layer morphology along with the comparison between silica scaling and colloidal silica fouling provided explicit evidence that homogenous nucleation was not the exclusive scaling mechanism and indicated that the interaction of silica particles deposited on the membrane with soluble silica species in the feedwater facilitated the water vapour flux decline accordingly a four step mechanism was proposed for silica scaling in md involving both homogenous and heterogeneous nucleation as a result hydrophilic coating or a superhydrophobic surface with a slippery characteristic in this study was unable to markedly mitigate silica scaling in md further the scale layer formed under high silica concentration exhibited a compact and gel like morphology which completely covered the membrane surface and was likely responsible for the dramatic water vapour flux decline during the dcmd experiments under both silica concentrations the electrical conductivity of the distillate stream remained unchanged throughout the dcmd experiments indicating that membrane wetting did not occur regardless of silica concentrations present in the feed water or the water vapour flux behaviours of the tested membranes in other experiments christie et al 75 comparing gypsum and silica scaling in md determined different scaling kinetics as a result of slower rate of silicic acid polymerisation than that of gypsum crystallisation besides the authors also observed that after gypsum scaling the surface of the pvdf membrane was covered by gypsum crystals while after silica scaling the membrane surface showed an amorphous feature their experimental results also suggest that pore wetting resulted from gypsum scaling but not from silica scaling as a result these facts suggest that silica of the most probable causes of fouling in the present study the eds results fig 10 also show the presence of mg and ca on the membrane after treatment of the roc this is in line with the data reported in fig 11 where it is shown that with the used feed composition in terms of calcium magnesium and sulphate magnesium and calcium sulphates will occur in the dcmd concentrate on the other hand after cleaning with deionised water the water vapour fluxes were always restored close to their initial values for all membranes which is supported by eds analyses from membranes after cleaning fig 10b where a minor quantity and intensity of peaks were observed demonstrating the effectiveness of cleaning with deionised water 4 conclusions all the membranes evaluated in dcmd treatment demonstrated satisfactory wrrs achieving values close to 90 and high rejection factors above 99 5 for all parameters the membranes made of pe presented higher water vapour fluxes than the one made of ptfe the oleophobic membrane from aquastil pe o presented the best performance with a low water vapour flux decline even with a wrr of 90 taking these results into account by integrating ro with dcmd using the membrane with the best performance i e pe o the global wrr was as high as 95 confirming that md is doubtlessly an appropriate process that can be integrated with ro to enhance global water recovery and to reduce the volume of concentrate discharged approaching the concept of zero liquid discharge nevertheless membrane characteristics are very important for minimising the occurrence of fouling and scaling maintaining a high flux for longer periods and thus enabling the application of the dcmd process in the

13726,vinasse is characterized by a high chemical oxygen demand cod and dark brown colour which requires abatement before disposal to prevent the pollution of receiving streams anaerobic digestion ad usually applied for vinasse treatment can only reduce the cod with the colour remaining unabated this study investigated the feasibility of combining ad and ozonation for vinasse treatment the ad process alone achieved high cod removal of 95 at a best organic loading rate of 15 kgcod m3 d however the anaerobic effluent still had an intense dark brown colour caused by a considerable amount of residual biorecalcitrant cod of 4 5 g l the ozonation post treatment of the anaerobic effluent removed 80 of the colour with up to 92 ozone transfer at optimal parameters of ph 4 substrate dilution factor of 2 and 90 mg l min ozone dosage kinetic analysis showed that for a constant feed flow combined system the ratio of the anaerobic reactor unit to the ozonation reactor unit is recommended to be 20 1 also from energy analysis application of the bioenergy produced from ad to supplement the total energy requirement of the combined system could lead to 50 savings on energy and a carbon dioxide emission reduction of 122 kg co2 m3 of vinasse treated the combined system is thus a promising technology for vinasse treatment and can contribute to combating greenhouse gas emissions keywords anaerobic digestion cost reduction energy recovery organic load ozone 1 introduction vinasse the wastewater from alcohol distilleries is characterized by a very high organic load chemical oxygen demand cod 92 100 g l five day biochemical oxygen demand bod5 52 58 g l and a dark colour 1 the colour is caused by heterogeneous nitrogen containing brown pigments formed during the non enzymatic reaction maillard involving amino acids and carbohydrates 2 the pigments also known as melanoidins due to their polymeric nature high molecular weight hmw 5 0 kda and anti oxidative nature are recalcitrant to biodegradation 3 the biorecalcitrant nature of the melanoidin pigment is shown by the fact that it escapes from the conventional anaerobic wastewater treatment and finally ends up in the environment in the form of the coloured effluent consequently whereas the anaerobic process can effectively reduce the high organic load cod and bod5 the recalcitrant dark brown colour remains unabated 4 if the anaerobic effluent is discharged into aquatic systems such as rivers lakes or dams without further treatment the colour can block light and prevent photosynthesis by aquatic plants leading to eutrophication the melanoidins have also been reported to indirectly directly cause severe health problems such as having cytotoxic mutagenic and carcinogenic effects on human cells 5 for effective removal of the colour and the organic load combining the anaerobic process with a post treatment technique is necessary the advanced oxidation processes aops are some of the highly competitive treatment techniques that can be easily applied to remove the biorecalcitrant compounds 6 7 of the aops ozonation has several advantages including the ability to remove turbidity easily installed and operated minimal effect to downstream processes and improved degradation efficiency at standard conditions 8 10 ozone can directly or indirectly attack the melanoidins and break them down through chain reactions into colourless aliphatic compounds and simple products such as co2 and h2o 11 13 the aops are usually high cost but their application alongside the anaerobic digestion can significantly reduce the overall cost of operation 14 15 finding the optimal conditions for the combined system is necessary to aid in process design analysis of the kinetics of the individual processes can inform reactor sizing and provide the necessary information in determining the best flow control mechanism factors such as the organic loading rate olr of the initial step may have an impact on the efficiency of the ensuing process 16 for this reason it is important to determine whether dilution may be needed as the effluent flows from the first unit to the other or if a holding tank may be necessary for flow stabilization in the combined system the costs should be reduced by minimizing aop treatment and maximizing the ad stage 4 14 the bioenergy produced from the anaerobic process can be used to provide or supplement the energy requirement of the combined system and offset the energy demand from the national grid this study investigated the application of a combined anaerobic ozonation system for the treatment of vinasse the combined system was evaluated based on parameters such as reaction kinetics organic loading rate ozone transfer ph hydraulic retention time and pollutant removal the energy and cost analysis of the combined process was carried out to determine if the bioenergy produced could be used to supplement the energy requirement of the treatment system and offset the grid energy cost by using the bioenergy produced the reduction in carbon dioxide emission was determined 2 material and methods 2 1 materials potassium dichromate k2cr2o7 99 9 sodium hydroxide naoh 99 9 sodium thiosulphate na2s2o3 potassium iodide ki concentrated sulphuric acid h2so4 hydrochloric acid hcl 32 and silver sulfate ag2so4 99 9 were sourced from merck limited south africa all the reagents which were of analytical grade were used as received the working solutions including standards and substrate dilutions were prepared using deionized water real vinasse was sourced from a local alcohol distillation plant using cane molasses in durban south africa the vinasse was diluted then subjected to anaerobic digestion followed by ozonation the physical and chemical characteristics of the vinasse are given in table 1 2 2 anaerobic digester start up and operation anaerobic digestion was carried out in an up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb digester fig 1 a the 3 5 l digester made of an acrylic glass column had a working volume of 3 l which consisted of 1 l sludge bed anaerobic granules and 2 l substrate solution vinasse the digester was inoculated with 1 l of the anaerobic sludge granules sourced from a local full scale uasb digester treating vinasse then 2 l of distilled water added for stabilization for 24 h at the beginning of the batch start up after stabilization an aliquot of the supernatant was withdrawn and a similar volume of vinasse dosed the daily olr was increased gradually while monitoring the ph biogas production and volatile fatty acids vfa alkalinity alk ratio after 33 days the reactor was stable at the optimum organic loading rate of 15 kgcodm 3d 1 as was determined by a stable ph of about 7 5 and desired vfa alk ratio of 0 4 the digester was thereafter operated semi continuously at the olr of 15 kgcodm 3d 1 the digested effluent was subjected to ozonation 2 3 ozonation experiments ozonation of the anaerobically digested vinasse was carried out in a 4 l capacity ozone reactor made of glass ozone gas was obtained from the air supplied by an air compressor using an ozone generator then bubbled through the reactor via a gas distributor located at the bottom fig 1b different ozone flowrates were obtained by controlling the airflow rate to the generator using a rotameter and a valve the unreacted ozone gas was destroyed by bubbling through a solution of potassium iodide ozone trap during the treatment processes samples were withdrawn and analyzed 2 4 chemical and physical analysis the cod and bod were determined following the standard methods of analyses 17 colour was analysed using a uv vis spectrophotometer pg instruments limited t80 uv vis spectrometer at a maximum absorption wavelength Î» max of 475 nm a toc analyzer teledyne tekmar was used for analyzing the total organic carbon toc the concentration of the unreacted ozone that was captured in the ki solution

where p is the ozone generator power kw t is the ozonation duration minutes v is the amount of substrate l c f and c i respectively are the final and initial substrate concentrations 19 dilution of the substrate anaerobic effluent is sometimes necessary before ozonation post treatment also since the ozone reactor was coupled to an external air compressor the electrical energy requirement of the compressor had to be taken into consideration thus the electrical energy consumption of the ozone reactor taking into consideration dilution and the air compressor was determined using a modified electrical energy per order eoz as 3 e o z p o z o n e p c o m p r e s s o r t 1000 v l o g c i c f d f where p o z o n e and p c o m p r e s s o r are the ozone reactor power kw and air compressor

0 957 kg co2e kwh and elbio is the electricity generated from biomethane kwh m3 and presumably applied to power the ozone generator 3 results and discussion 3 1 anaerobic digestion the cod colour and bod reductions were monitored at the best olr of 15 kgcodm 3d 1 from day 33 after obtaining the optimum olr from fig 2a the cod removal increased from 32 on day 34 to 57 on day 35 and 63 on day 37 the low reduction of cod at the beginning of the semi continuous operation was partly due to residual organics accumulated during the start up that still existed in the reactor and acclimatization of the microorganisms with the new feeding method transiting from batch to a semi continuous feeding the highest cod removal of 71 on day 41 was attained after all the residuals had been removed the anaerobic process was also monitored by changes in bod5 and bod5 cod ratio as shown in fig 2b an average final bod5 of 550 mg l representing a reduction of up to 92 was achieved the bod5 cod ratio of the ad treated effluent averaged at around 0 09 from an initial value of 0 48 before ad signifying the near complete removal of the biodegradable constituents of the vinasse given that up to 92 of the bod was removed the remaining organic matter contributing to the average residual cod of 4 5 g l was therefore attributed to the biorecalcitrant colour causing pigments such as melanoidins as evidenced by a poor colour reduction in the ad step fig 2c the negative colour reduction observed implied an increase in colour intensity during ad the melanoidin compounds repolymerizes into high molecular weight long chain organic compounds with increased colour intensity 3 to remove the biorecalcitrant colour the ad effluent was subjected to ozonation post treatment 3 2 effect of operational parameters on ozonation post treatment the effect of ozone dosage initial concentration and initial ph on decolourisation toc reduction and ozone transfer were investigated during the ozonation post treatment fig 3 to investigate the effect of initial concentration the ad effluent was subjected to varying dilutions 2 4 6 8 the highest colour removal 90 was achieved at the lowest initial concentration also the highest dilution factor df fig 3a increased initial concentration resulted in decreased colour removal the highest initial concentration 1 df undiluted ad effluent had the least colour removal 29 signifying the importance of diluting the colour intense vinasse before ozonation to minimize the cost of treatment by avoiding excessive dilution the 2 dilution factor with 78 colour removed and 90 ozone transfer was selected as optimum the process was optimized further by varying the ozone dosage while maintaining the 2 dilution ozone dosage of 90 mg l min resulted in the highest colour reduction 80 while the least dosage of 45 mg l min removed 71 of the colour fig 3b the higher dosages of 135 and 180 mg l min respectively had colour removals of 70 and 66 increased ozone dosage increased the number of o3 molecules attacking the aromatic compounds thus the improved colour removal however at the higher dosages the gas forms big bubbles thus reducing the contact between the supplied o3 molecules and the target compounds thereby significantly reducing the ozone mass transfer 23 as a result at the higher dosages the colour removal and ozone transfer decreased significantly the effect of ph which also plays an important role in the ozonation process was investigated at a constant dosage 90 mg l min and dilution 2 fig 3c the ph of 4 had the highest colour removal 90 in comparison to the 81 and 77 removals at the phs of 7 and 10 respectively contrastingly for the toc reduction which indicated mineralization the alkaline ph of 10 had the highest reduction of 16 fig 4 d under acidic ph ozone only attacks the colour causing parts such as the double bonds cc functional groups oh and och3 aromatic rings and negatively charged atoms 24 the attack caused the colour to disappear rapidly but with the formation of stable intermediate compounds and products the intermediates which include carboxylic acids are not susceptible to further ozone attack and are detected as organic compounds hence the low reduction in toc 25 under basic conditions ozone decomposition leads to the formation of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals oh which unselectively attacks all the organic compounds leading to decolourisation and mineralization 11 3 3 kinetics of anaerobic digestion and ozonation of vinasse in a combined system where ozonation is applied as post treatment after the anaerobic digestion of vinasse the kinetics study of the two processes is necessary for reactor design purposes the anaerobic process is aimed at the reduction of high organic load cod followed by decolourisation of the effluent through ozonation the kinetics of the anaerobic process was determined from the first order substrate removal model at steady state d s d t as 26 27 9 s o s t k 1 s where t s o s and k 1 are the retention time hrs initial substrate concentration substrate concentration at time t and reaction rate constant respectively the substrate removal rate was determined by a plot of s o s against t fig 4a as 0 83 g cod h based on the rate it was further determined that a hrt of 15 h would be required to reduce the cod of the vinasse by 75 in the anaerobic unit before subjecting it to ozonation a pseudo first order reaction model eqn 10 was used to determine the rate of ozonation decolorization of the anaerobically digested vinasse 10 d a d t k 1 a where t is the duration of ozonation mins and k 1 is the reaction rate constant min 1 integrating eq 10 yields 11 l n a a o k 1 t the colour reduction had a rate constant of 0 0326 min 1 at ph 4 as shown in fig 4b from the rate constant a colour removal of 75 would require ozonation for 15 min the rates of both the preceding anaerobic step and that of the ensuing ozonation post treatment show that the time required for anaerobic treatment of vinasse is 20 times that required for ozonation decolorization post treatment when an optimum olr of 15 kgcod m3 d is applied therefore for effective integration of the two processes the ozone reactor should be 20 times smaller than that of the anaerobic for a complete continuous process alternatively a reservoir can be installed to contain the anaerobically digested effluent before ozonation for easy flow regulation this may be very necessary for it can allow for batch operation of the ozonation process to reduce energy requirements 3 4 economic analyses of the combined process the energy analysis for ad was done based on potential electrical energy generated from the biogas produced by the anaerobic process at the olr of 15 kg cod m3 d total biogas production of 10 l d at steady state for every cod reduction of 75 the biogas had an average methane composition of 70 the total bioenergy produced from the anaerobic process ebio was equivalent to 78 33 kw h m3 if a biogas conversion to heat and electricity using a generator with 78 efficiency is assumed then the total electricity from biogas e l b i o will be 25 85 kw h m3 and thermal energy e h b i o of 34 47 kw h m3 fig 5 a for the ozonation post treatment the energy required for decolourising the anaerobic effluent by up to 75 was determined to be 32 kw h m3 fig 5b the total electricity from biogas e l b i o of 25 85 kw h m3 can be used to meet up to 75 of the energy requirement of ozonation while the thermal energy e h b i o of 34 47 kw h m3 can meet up to 90 of the heat energy required for the ad reactor the use of the electricity and heat energy produced from biogas to supplement the total energy requirements of the integrated system could achieve up to 50 energy savings using the electricity from biogas of 25 85 kw h m3 to supplement the energy requirement of the ozonation process could lead to a cer of 24 73 kg co2e m3 fig 5b the thermal energy from biogas of 34 47 kw h m3 if used for heating the bioreactor could lead to a cer of 32 98 kg co2e m3 application of the total ebio of 78 33 kw h m3 could achieve a maximum cer of 74 65 kg co2e m3 the cost analysis was based on the cost reduction resulting from the possible application of the electricity generated from biomethane to run the anaerobic and ozonation processes by applying the cost of electricity unit of 0 08 usd kwh 28 the total electricity requirement of the integrated system including ozone generator anaerobic unit and other major electrical components was determined to be 159 96 kwhr m3 costing approximately 12 8 usd m3 table 2 and fig 5c using the total bioenergy produced of 78 33 kw h m3 to supplement the energy requirement of the integrated system could result in up to 50 savings on the total energy cost 3 5 comparison of integrated ad ozonation with other treatment options in our previous study focusing on an integrated ad photodegradation treatment process the electricity from biogas could only meet 25 of the energy required for the photodegradation post treatment process with a cer of 68 8 kg co2e m3 when heat produced was presumably used to heat the ad unit 29 in a study where the electricity from biogas obtained from an industrial scale plant was used to power homes a cer of 55 kg co2e m3 was reported 30 based on the comparisons the combined ad ozonation system is the most promising given the highest cer of 122 kg co2e m3 and lower energy demand for ozonation post treatment than photodegradation for large scale industrial applications the capital cost which depends on the reactor size should be considered moreover it may be necessary to install a desulphurisation unit for biogas cleaning before conversion into electricity and heat 4 conclusions anaerobic digestion applied as an initial step for vinasse treatment achieved bod and cod reduction of 70 and 92 respectively at an optimum olr of 15 kgcod m3 d however despite the high bod and cod removal a considerable amount of biorecalcitrant compounds still existed contributing to a residual cod of 4 5 g l and biorecalcitrant colour this necessitated the introduction of a post treatment ozonation process for colour removal the ozonation post treatment was affected by several parameters including substrate dilution ozone dosage and initial ph with optimal values of 2 dilution factor 90 mg l min dosage and ph 11 respectively determined at the optimal ozonation conditions adequate ozone transfer 95 and colour removal 80 were achieved from the energy analysis the electricity from biogas could subsidize up to 75 of the energy requirement of the ozonation process while the thermal energy of 34 kw h m3 could meet 90 of the heat energy requirement of the ad unit using the total bioenergy produced to supplement the total energy requirement of the integrated system ad and ozonation can lead to 50 savings on energy from the grid and a carbon dioxide emission reduction cer of 122 kg co2e m3 thus based on the pollution removal efficiency energy cost and environmental analysis the industrial application of the integrated ad ozonation system for dww treatment

factor of 2 and 90 mg l min ozone dosage kinetic analysis showed that for a constant feed flow combined system the ratio of the anaerobic reactor unit to the ozonation reactor unit is recommended to be 20 1 also from energy analysis application of the bioenergy produced from ad to supplement the total energy requirement of the combined system could lead to 50 savings on energy and a carbon dioxide emission reduction of 122 kg co2 m3 of vinasse treated the combined system is thus a promising technology for vinasse treatment and can contribute to combating greenhouse gas emissions

oxygen demand cod 92 100 g l five day biochemical oxygen demand bod5 52 58 g l and a dark colour 1 the colour is caused by heterogeneous nitrogen containing brown pigments formed during the non enzymatic reaction maillard involving amino acids and carbohydrates 2 the pigments also known as melanoidins due to their polymeric nature high molecular weight hmw 5 0 kda and anti oxidative nature are recalcitrant to biodegradation 3 the biorecalcitrant nature of the melanoidin pigment is shown by the fact that it escapes from the conventional anaerobic wastewater treatment and finally ends up in the environment in the form of the coloured effluent consequently whereas the anaerobic process can effectively reduce the high organic load cod and bod5 the recalcitrant dark brown colour remains unabated 4 if the anaerobic effluent is discharged into aquatic systems such as rivers lakes or dams without further treatment the colour can block light and prevent photosynthesis by aquatic plants leading to eutrophication the melanoidins have also been reported to indirectly directly cause severe health problems such as having cytotoxic mutagenic and carcinogenic effects on human cells 5 for effective removal of the colour and the organic load combining the anaerobic process with a post treatment technique is necessary the advanced oxidation processes aops are some of the highly competitive treatment techniques that can be easily applied to remove the biorecalcitrant compounds 6 7 of the aops ozonation has several advantages including the ability to remove turbidity easily installed and operated minimal effect to downstream processes and improved degradation efficiency at standard conditions 8 10 ozone can directly or indirectly attack the melanoidins and break them down through chain reactions into colourless aliphatic compounds and simple products such as co2 and h2o 11 13 the aops are usually high cost but their application alongside the anaerobic digestion can significantly reduce the overall cost of operation 14 15 finding the optimal conditions for the combined system is necessary to aid in process design analysis of the kinetics of the individual processes can inform reactor sizing and provide the necessary information in determining the best flow control mechanism factors such as the organic loading rate olr of the initial step may have an impact on the efficiency of the ensuing process 16 for this reason it is important to determine whether dilution may be needed as the effluent flows from the first unit to the other or if a holding tank may be necessary for flow stabilization in the combined system the costs should be reduced by minimizing aop treatment and maximizing the ad stage 4 14 the bioenergy produced from the anaerobic process can be used to provide or supplement the energy requirement of the combined system and offset the energy demand from the national grid this study investigated the application of a combined anaerobic ozonation system for the treatment of vinasse the combined system was evaluated based on parameters such as reaction kinetics organic loading rate ozone transfer ph hydraulic retention time and pollutant removal the energy and cost analysis of the combined process was carried out to determine if the bioenergy produced could be used to supplement the energy requirement of the treatment system and offset the grid energy cost by using the bioenergy produced the reduction in carbon dioxide emission was determined 2 material and methods 2 1 materials potassium dichromate k2cr2o7 99 9 sodium hydroxide naoh 99 9 sodium thiosulphate na2s2o3 potassium iodide ki concentrated sulphuric acid h2so4 hydrochloric acid hcl 32 and silver sulfate ag2so4 99 9 were sourced from merck limited south africa all the reagents which were of analytical grade were used as received the working solutions including standards and substrate dilutions were prepared using deionized water real vinasse was sourced from a local alcohol distillation plant using cane molasses in durban south africa the vinasse was diluted then subjected to anaerobic digestion followed by ozonation the physical and chemical characteristics of the vinasse are given in table 1 2 2 anaerobic digester start up and operation anaerobic digestion was carried out in an up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb digester fig 1 a the 3 5 l digester made of an acrylic glass column had a working volume of 3 l which consisted of 1 l sludge bed anaerobic granules and 2 l substrate solution vinasse the digester was inoculated with 1 l of the anaerobic sludge granules sourced from a local full scale uasb digester treating vinasse then 2 l of distilled water added for stabilization for 24 h at the beginning of the batch start up after stabilization an aliquot of the supernatant was withdrawn and a similar volume of vinasse dosed the daily olr was increased gradually while monitoring the ph biogas production and volatile fatty acids vfa alkalinity alk ratio after 33 days the reactor was stable at the optimum organic loading rate of 15 kgcodm 3d 1 as was determined by a stable ph of about 7 5 and desired vfa alk ratio of 0 4 the digester was thereafter operated semi continuously at the olr of 15 kgcodm 3d 1 the digested effluent was subjected to ozonation 2 3 ozonation experiments ozonation of the anaerobically digested vinasse was carried out in a 4 l capacity ozone reactor made of glass ozone gas was obtained from the air supplied by an air compressor using an ozone generator then bubbled through the reactor via a gas distributor located at the bottom fig 1b different ozone flowrates were obtained by controlling the airflow rate to the generator using a rotameter and a valve the unreacted ozone gas was destroyed by bubbling through a solution of potassium iodide ozone trap during the treatment processes samples were withdrawn and analyzed 2 4 chemical and physical analysis the cod and bod were determined following the standard methods of analyses 17 colour was analysed using a uv vis spectrophotometer pg instruments limited t80 uv vis spectrometer at a maximum absorption wavelength Î» max of 475 nm a toc analyzer teledyne tekmar was used for analyzing the total organic carbon toc the concentration of the unreacted ozone that was captured in the ki solution was determined using a titrimetric method 13 2 5 ozone transfer the percentage of used up ozone ozone transfer was determined by 1 o 3 u o 3 c o 3 s x 100 where o3u o 3 s and o 3 c are the ozone

where p is the ozone generator power kw t is the ozonation duration minutes v is the amount of substrate l c f and c i respectively are the final and initial substrate concentrations 19 dilution of the substrate anaerobic effluent is sometimes necessary before ozonation post treatment also since the ozone reactor was coupled to an external air compressor the electrical energy requirement of the compressor had to be taken into consideration thus the electrical energy consumption of the ozone reactor taking into consideration dilution and the air compressor was determined using a modified electrical energy per order eoz as 3 e o z p o z o n e p c o m p r e s s o r t 1000 v l o g c i c f d f where p o z o n e and p c o m p r e s s o r are the ozone reactor power kw and air compressor

bod reductions were monitored at the best olr of 15 kgcodm 3d 1 from day 33 after obtaining the optimum olr from fig 2a the cod removal increased from 32 on day 34 to 57 on day 35 and 63 on day 37 the low reduction of cod at the beginning of the semi continuous operation was partly due to residual organics accumulated during the start up that still existed in the reactor and acclimatization of the microorganisms with the new feeding method transiting from batch to a semi continuous feeding the highest cod removal of 71 on day 41 was attained after all the residuals had been removed the anaerobic process was also monitored by changes in bod5 and bod5 cod ratio as shown in fig 2b an average final bod5 of 550 mg l representing a reduction of up to 92 was achieved the bod5 cod ratio of the ad treated effluent averaged at around 0 09 from an initial value of 0 48 before ad signifying the near complete removal of the biodegradable constituents of the vinasse given that up to 92 of the bod was removed the remaining organic matter contributing to the average residual cod of 4 5 g l was therefore attributed to the biorecalcitrant colour causing pigments such as melanoidins as evidenced by a poor colour reduction in the ad step fig 2c the negative colour reduction observed implied an increase in colour intensity during ad the melanoidin compounds repolymerizes into high molecular weight long chain organic compounds with increased colour intensity 3 to remove the biorecalcitrant colour the ad effluent was subjected to ozonation post treatment 3 2 effect of operational parameters on ozonation post treatment the effect of ozone dosage initial concentration and initial ph on decolourisation toc reduction and ozone transfer were investigated during the ozonation post treatment fig 3 to investigate the effect of initial concentration the ad effluent was subjected to varying dilutions 2 4 6 8 the highest colour removal 90 was achieved at the lowest initial concentration also the highest dilution factor df fig 3a increased initial concentration resulted in decreased colour removal the highest initial concentration 1 df undiluted ad effluent had the least colour removal 29 signifying the importance of diluting the colour intense vinasse before ozonation to minimize the cost of treatment by avoiding excessive dilution the 2 dilution factor with 78 colour removed and 90 ozone transfer was selected as optimum the process was optimized further by varying the ozone dosage while maintaining the 2 dilution ozone dosage of 90 mg l min resulted in the highest colour reduction 80 while the least dosage of 45 mg l min removed 71 of the colour fig 3b the higher dosages of 135 and 180 mg l min respectively had colour removals of 70 and 66 increased ozone dosage increased the number of o3 molecules attacking the aromatic compounds thus the improved colour removal however at the higher dosages the gas forms big bubbles thus reducing the contact between the supplied o3 molecules and the target compounds thereby significantly reducing the ozone mass transfer 23 as a result at the higher dosages the colour removal and ozone transfer decreased significantly the effect of ph which also plays an important role in the ozonation process was investigated at a constant dosage 90 mg l min and dilution 2 fig 3c the ph of 4 had the highest colour removal 90 in comparison to the 81 and 77 removals at the phs of 7 and 10 respectively contrastingly for the toc reduction which indicated mineralization the alkaline ph of 10 had the highest reduction of 16 fig 4 d under acidic ph ozone only attacks the colour causing parts such as the double bonds cc functional groups oh and och3 aromatic rings and negatively charged atoms 24 the attack caused the colour to disappear rapidly but with the formation of stable intermediate compounds and products the intermediates which include carboxylic acids are not susceptible to further ozone attack and are detected as organic compounds hence the low reduction in toc 25 under basic conditions ozone decomposition leads to the formation of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals oh which unselectively attacks all the organic compounds leading to decolourisation and mineralization 11 3 3 kinetics of anaerobic digestion and ozonation of vinasse in a combined system where ozonation is applied as post treatment after the anaerobic digestion of vinasse the kinetics study of the two processes is necessary for reactor design purposes the anaerobic process is aimed at the reduction of high organic load cod followed by decolourisation of the effluent through ozonation the kinetics of the anaerobic process was determined from the first order substrate removal model at steady state d s d t as 26 27 9 s o s t k 1 s where t s o s and k 1 are the retention time hrs initial substrate concentration substrate concentration at time t and reaction rate constant respectively the substrate removal rate was determined by a plot of s o s against t fig 4a as 0 83 g cod h based on the rate it was further determined that a hrt of 15 h would be required to reduce the cod of the vinasse by 75 in the anaerobic unit before subjecting it to ozonation a pseudo first order reaction model eqn 10 was used to determine the rate of ozonation decolorization of the anaerobically digested vinasse 10 d a d t k 1 a where t is the duration of ozonation mins and k 1 is the reaction rate constant min 1 integrating eq 10 yields 11 l n a a o k 1 t the colour reduction had a rate constant of 0 0326 min 1 at ph 4 as shown in fig 4b from the rate constant a colour removal of 75 would require ozonation for 15 min the rates of both the preceding anaerobic step and that of the ensuing ozonation post treatment show that the time required for anaerobic treatment of vinasse is 20 times that required for ozonation decolorization post treatment when an optimum olr of 15 kgcod m3 d is applied therefore for effective integration of the two processes the ozone reactor should be 20 times smaller than that of the anaerobic for a complete continuous process alternatively a reservoir can be installed to contain the anaerobically digested effluent before ozonation for easy flow regulation this may be very necessary for it can allow for batch operation of the ozonation process to reduce energy requirements 3 4 economic analyses of the combined process the energy analysis for ad was done based on potential electrical energy generated from the biogas produced by the anaerobic process at the olr of 15 kg cod m3 d total biogas production of 10 l d at steady state for every cod reduction of 75 the biogas had an average methane composition of 70 the total bioenergy produced from the anaerobic process ebio was equivalent to 78 33 kw h m3 if a biogas conversion to heat and electricity using a generator with 78 efficiency is assumed then the total electricity from biogas e l b i o will be 25 85 kw h m3 and thermal energy e h b i o of 34 47 kw h m3 fig 5 a for the ozonation post treatment the energy required for decolourising the anaerobic effluent by up to 75 was determined to be 32 kw h m3 fig 5b the total electricity from biogas e l b i o of 25 85 kw h m3 can be used to meet up to 75 of the energy requirement of ozonation while the thermal energy e h b i o of 34 47 kw h m3 can meet up to 90 of the heat energy required for the ad reactor the use of the electricity and heat energy produced from biogas to supplement the total energy requirements of the integrated system could achieve up to 50 energy savings using the electricity from biogas of 25 85 kw h m3 to supplement the energy requirement of the ozonation process could lead to a cer of 24 73 kg co2e m3 fig 5b the thermal energy from biogas of 34 47 kw h m3 if used for heating the bioreactor could lead to a cer of 32 98 kg co2e m3 application of the total ebio of 78 33 kw h m3 could achieve a maximum cer of 74 65 kg co2e m3 the cost analysis was based on the cost reduction resulting from the possible application of the electricity generated from biomethane to run the anaerobic and ozonation processes by applying the cost of electricity unit of 0 08 usd kwh 28 the total electricity requirement of the integrated system including ozone generator anaerobic unit and other major electrical components was determined to be 159 96 kwhr m3 costing approximately 12 8 usd m3 table 2 and fig 5c using the total bioenergy produced of 78 33 kw h m3 to supplement the energy requirement of the integrated system could result in up to 50 savings on the total energy cost 3 5 comparison of integrated ad ozonation with other treatment options in our previous study focusing on an integrated ad photodegradation treatment process the electricity from biogas could only meet 25 of the energy required for the photodegradation post treatment process with a cer of 68 8 kg co2e m3 when heat produced was presumably used to heat the ad unit 29 in a study where the electricity from biogas obtained from an industrial scale plant was used to power homes a cer of 55 kg co2e m3 was reported 30 based on the comparisons the combined ad ozonation system is the most promising given the highest cer of 122 kg co2e m3 and lower energy demand for ozonation post treatment than photodegradation for large scale industrial applications the capital cost which depends on the reactor size should be considered moreover it may be necessary to install a desulphurisation unit for biogas cleaning before conversion into electricity and heat 4 conclusions anaerobic digestion applied as an initial step for vinasse treatment achieved bod and cod reduction of 70 and 92 respectively at an optimum olr of 15 kgcod m3 d however despite the high bod and cod removal a considerable amount of biorecalcitrant compounds still existed contributing to a residual cod of 4 5 g l and biorecalcitrant colour this necessitated the introduction of a post treatment ozonation process for colour removal the ozonation post treatment was affected by several parameters including substrate dilution ozone dosage and initial ph with optimal values of 2 dilution factor 90 mg l min dosage and ph 11 respectively determined at the optimal ozonation conditions adequate ozone transfer 95 and colour removal 80 were achieved from the energy analysis the electricity from biogas could subsidize up to 75 of the energy requirement of the ozonation process while the thermal energy of 34 kw h m3 could meet 90 of the heat energy requirement of the ad unit using the total bioenergy produced to supplement the total energy requirement of the integrated system ad and ozonation can lead to 50 savings on energy from the grid and a carbon dioxide emission reduction cer of 122 kg co2e m3 thus based on the pollution removal efficiency energy cost and environmental analysis the industrial application of the integrated ad ozonation system for dww treatment

13727,the textile industry discharges large amounts of polluted wastewater containing synthetic dyes a down flow hanging sponge dhs reactor is a novel aerobic wastewater treatment process that utilizes a sponge as a biomass retaining carrier this sponge carrier has both aerobic and anaerobic zones owing to different dissolved oxygen concentrations in this study the process performance of a dhs reactor treating actual textile wastewater obtained from a factory in japan was evaluated the effects of hydraulic retention time hrt and effluent recirculation recirculation ratio 1 on the dhs process performance were investigated the dhs reactor showed good organic up to 93 13 of bod and nitrogen removal 56 14 of tn abilities during the entire experimental period the color removal efficiencies of the dhs reactor were 55 15 53 26 72 34 and 35 22 with hrts of 4 h 4 h effluent recirculation r 1 8 h effluent recirculation r 1 and 8 h respectively microbial community structure analysis of the dhs retained sludge showed that genus acinetobacter was detected predominantly and reported as an azo dye degrading bacterium effluent recirculation was also observed to increase the presence of aromatic degrading bacteria and protists in the dhs reactor these results suggest that the dhs reactor is suitable for textile wastewater treatment furthermore the effluent recirculation is effective for enhancing decolorization performance keywords textile wastewater trickling filter reactor biological wastewater treatment 1 introduction in recent years the rapid growth of the textile industry has been accompanied by constant concerns of the environmental problems relating to the wastewater accounting for nearly 1 of worldwide global gross domestic product gdp in 2018 however the textile industry is considered responsible for nearly 20 of the global industrial wastewater 1 in textile processing operation the wet processes of fabric namely desiring scouring bleaching mercerizing dyeing printing and other finishing stages are the main sources of liquid waste 2 therefore textile wastewater is made up of the contributions from various chemicals at each stage and typically characterized by high ph and turbidity poor biodegradability complex composition and especially high chrominance 3 highly colored effluent might be a result of the inefficient dyeing process where 20 50 of chromophore groups responsible for color in synthetic dye molecules escape from fabric attachment and release into environment 4 these hazardous substances may have severe effects on plant photosynthetic function if released into the soil environment and aquatic life due to low light penetration and oxygen consumption 2 thus dyeing wastewater needs to be treated before its discharge into the natural environment to date significant effort has been made by scientists to find a proper method for treating this wastewater however the fact that over 7 105 tons of dyes are synthesized worldwide every year 5 and continuous changes are made in their structure to meet the needs of improving color shades and colorfastness as a result the effective treatment of this recalcitrant wastewater remains a major knowledge gap that has attracted considerable scientific attention to treat this kind of wastewater physical oxidation and biological treatment technologies are currently used however physicaltreatment technology produces a large amount of excess sludge and records low decolorization efficiency while high operational cost and toxic byproduct generation have been known as concerns of the oxidation treatment method biological treatment technologies including anaerobic or aerobic treatment are one of the promising methods with cost effective and environmentally friendly advantages 2 modern dyes are designed to be recalcitrant for long term use and thus resistant to aerobic wastewater treatment 6 meanwhile the anaerobic method has been proven to be capable of treating dyeing wastewater under the supports of electron donating systems and different enzymes such as azo reductase laccase and peroxidase 7 thus so far several types of anaerobic reactors such as upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors 8 9 anaerobic baffled reactor 10 16 or strengthened circulation anaerobic reactor 3 have been applied to treat textile wastewater and achieved positive results nevertheless the most common disadvantage of anaerobic single phase treatment is the generation of aromatic amines toxic compounds but hard to be anaerobically degraded 11 a sequential anaerobic aerobic method therefore has been proposed to address these issues as a complete solution for textile dyeing wastewater treatment rabia shoukat et al 12 assessed the performance of combined anaerobic and aerobic sequence batch reactors sbr biosystem for real textile wastewater treatment and found that at 54 hours of hydraulic retention time hrt for the whole system 78 and 99 of color and total chemical oxygen demand cod were processed respectively in another study by m concetta tomei et al 13 the real textile wastewater was also treated in a sequential anaerobic sbr aerobic sbr system and achieved a color removal efficiency of 70 80 despite that these systems require a relatively long processing time which was approximately 24 72 h of hrt 14 16 and can be difficult to operate and control due to the connection of two separate reactors furthermore dye and its anaerobically decolorized products can inhibit the activity of obligate anaerobic microorganisms such as acetoclastic methanogens 17 a down flow hanging sponge dhs reactor seems to have the potential to solve those problems the dhs reactor is a biological trickling filter using sponges as a biomass retaining carrier and known as one of the most promising treatment systems for domestic sewage and industrial wastewaters 18 this is due to high retained sludge concentration excellent degradation efficiency high effluent quality and low operational costs 18 19 besides air naturally dissolves into the wastewater as it flows down in the sponge carrier thus the dhs reactor can perform high oxygen transfer without external aeration 20 the dhs reactor immobilizes active bacteria including not only aerobic but also anaerobic and anoxic bacteria inside a sponge that behaves as a biomass retaining carrier 18 21 22 this high microbial diversity in the dhs sponge carrier may be applicable as a combination of anaerobic and aerobic processes for textile wastewater treatment within a single reactor achieving an aerobic anoxic zone in a single dhs reactor has previously been reported in a single stage partial nitritation reactor 20 23 and in a dhs reactor for natural rubber processing wastewater treatment 24 this aerobic anoxic within a single reactor has also been achieved within a closed aquaculture system 25 the treatment of textile wastewater by using a dhs reactor with the addition of cationic polymers was demonstrated by tawfik et al 26 and achieved high organic loads no wash clogging problems high biomass retention time and high decolorization performance of the reactive dyes in this study a laboratory scale dhs reactor was continuously operated to develop an appropriate treatment system for treating low strength actual textile wastewater using the dhs reactor in japan without any additives the purpose of this study was to determine optimal operating conditions for the treatment of textile wastewater in particular the optimized hrt and effluent recirculation also 16s and 18s ribosomal ribonucleic acid rrna gene sequencing of dhs sponge retaining microorganisms were carried out to understand the microbial community structure 2 materials and

commencement of the experiment the mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss of the seed sludge was 8900 mg l 1 the wastewater was fed to the top of the reactor using a peristaltic pump following

startup run at run 1 the hrt of the reactor was adjusted to 4 h the dhs effluent surface water of settling tank was recirculated to the influent to enhance organic and color removal in runs 2 and 3 the hrt was extended to 8 h to improve color removal during run 3 in run 4 the dhs reactor was operated without effluent recirculation 2 2 analytical methods samples were collected from the influent

discussion 3 1 organic and nitrogen removal the dhs reactor commenced at an olr of 1 6 kg cod m 3 day 1 table 2 presents a summary of the influent and effluent wastewater characterization during this experiment the bod removal efficiency of the dhs reactor immediately increased and was greater than 90 with 6 d of operation fig 2 however unexpected sludge washout was observed e g tss of effluent 272 mg l 1 on day 47 and the effluent quality from the dhs reactor deteriorated to address this issue a settling tank was installed on day 49 as post treatment following the dhs reactor to remove suspended solids in run 1 the dhs reactor was operated with an hrt of 4 h the total bod to total cod ratio of 0 22 0 04 in the influent indicated that the textile wastewater used in this study contained large amounts of slowly biodegradable organic compounds the influent and effluent total cod were 420 73 mg cod l 1 and 99 25 mg cod l 1 respectively during run 1 on the other hand a bod effluent of 6 2 4 8 mg l 1 showed that the dhs reactor removed most of the biodegradable organic compounds the bod removal efficiency was higher than a previous study using a dhs reactor for treating reactive dye wastewater 26 the effluent nitrate concentration of 5 0 4 3 mg n l 1 indicated that the dhs reactor performed nitrification of wastewater the dhs reactor also achieved a tn removal efficiency of 37 15 fig 3 the reduction of tn suggested that denitrification could occur in the dhs reactor in the dhs reactor machdar et al 36 observed that do gradient from 7 5 mg l 1 in the external layers of the sponge to approximately 0 2 mg l 1 in the inner layers 1 cm inside the sponge thus tn removal would occur to some anaerobic or anoxic degree in the dhs sponge carrier the tss and vss in the final effluent were 5 4 and 4 3 mg l 1 respectively during the operational period these results indicate that the dhs reactor has the potential to directly treat textile wastewater during run 2 the effluent of the dhs reactor was recirculated to the influent to enhance the removal of organics and nitrogen due to effluent recirculation the do of effluent increased 5 1 1 1 from 6 1 0 8 mg l 1 indicating that the oxygen transfer in the dhs reactor was enhanced by effluent circulation and sufficient do was supplied to the dhs reactor in the absence of external aeration in addition the cod and bod removal efficiencies of the reactor increased from 76 6 and 69 7 in run 1 to 81 6 and 76 8 in run 2 this enhancement of organic removal was potentially from 1 sufficient do being provided 2 effluent diluted the influent concentration and 3 some unbiodegradable compounds being degraded through the dhs reactor several times 24 37 the tn removal efficiency increased from 37 15 in run 1 to 49 11 in run 2 as oxidized nitrate was recirculated to the influent and converted to nitrogen gas hence effluent circulation was effective in removing organic and nitrogen in the dhs reactor in run 3 the dhs reactor was operated with an hrt of 8 h and effluent recirculation extending the hrt of the dhs reactor from 4 h to 8 h may lead to an increase in cod and bod removal efficiencies in run 3 the dhs reactor performed total cod and bod removal efficiencies of 83 8 and 93 12 respectively during this run the ammonia concentration of dhs influent and effluent were 5 7 3 4 mg n l 1 and 0 2 0 1 mg n l 1 correspondingly during this operational run likewise the tn removal efficiency increased to 56 14 tawfik et al 26 also reported improvement in organic and color removal with an extension of the hrt in a dhs reactor treating reactive dye wastewater based on these results it is clear that the simultaneous increase of the hrt from 4 h to 8 h and a decrease in the olr to 1 46 0 21 kg cod m 3 day 1 brings a significantly better performance of the reactor in terms of both organics and nitrogen removal in run 4 the dhs reactor was operated without effluent recirculation at an hrt of 8 h the cod and tn removal efficiencies deteriorated to 77 7 and 35 16 respectively this deterioration can be from residues of some non biodegradable organic compounds and generated nitrate in the effluent due to discontinuation of effluent recirculation in contrast the total bod removal efficiency reached its highest value of 98 1 with a Æ°i total bod in the effluent was 1 8 1 3 mg l because of the extension of sponge contacting time moreover most high nitrification rate was observed during this operational run therefore effluent recirculation may be an effective method for enhancing the removal of organics and nitrogen in the dhs reactor treating low strength textile wastewater overall in this study the optimal operating conditions for the dhs reactor were hrt of 8 h with effluent recirculation the dhs with an hrt of 4 h can achieve the discharge standards of japan i e total bod 120 mg l 1 tn 60 mg n l 1 as japan has not yet set color in the discharge standards 38 therefore the dhs reactor presents itself as an appropriate treatment system for textile wastewater 3 2 color removal as this study used actual textile wastewater it contains a wide variation in color based on the operational conditions of a textile factory thus the color removal efficiency of the dhs reactor was summarized by visual inspection of the influent color during each operating run table 3 blue wastewater was observed to be the most effectively removed in the dhs reactor with a removal efficiency of 62 84 the effective biodegradation of textile dye reactive blue has been reported in several previous studies 39 40 blue dyes used in the factory are more likely to be indigo dyes a common dye that produces the denim cloth for blue jeans and degraded by aerobic processes in a study by khelifi et al 41 a continuously combined aerobic bioprocess was applied to treat textile wastewater containing indigo dye and 97 of color removal efficiency was recorded besides the efficient aerobic treatment of blue dye was also reflected in run 2 and run 3 where the enhancement of oxygen concentration through effluent recirculation and an improvement in color removal efficiency took place simultaneously in contrast the removal of black and purple dyes in the wastewater were more effective in run 1 than in run 2 and run 4 outperformed run 3 in terms of color removal of purple textile wastewater these results suggest that effluent recirculation may adversely affect the decolorization of black and purple dyes by reducing the anaerobic anoxic area in the sponge carrier it is most likely that black and purple dyes were mostly eliminated anaerobically the black and purple dyes used may belong to the reactive dyes the most important dye class in the textile industry 43 and this dye group is reported to be degradable only in anaerobic digestion through azo bond cleaving process 44 3 3 do profiles in the dhs sponge carrier fig 4 shows the do concentration at different heights in the dhs reactor for different runs the do values in the sponge carriers largely differed from the hrt and effluent recirculation overall the do at 1 mm depth in the sponge was under 1 0 mg l 1 where conditions may be anaerobic or anoxic this low do concentration inside the sponge carriers is consistent with previous studies 20 21 at runs 1 and 4 the do inside the sponge ranged from 0 0 to 2 5 mg l 1 and 0 1 to 0 8 mg l 1 respectively following effluent recirculation the do increased to 5 0 mg l 1 at the bottom of the dhs reactor run 2 in contrast at reactor heights of 0 3 to 0 6 m the do concentration had significantly reduced and do may unitize the oxidation of organic and ammonia reactive dyes can be removed under anaerobic conditions 46 47 therefore this do variation in the sponge carriers is promising for textile dyeing wastewater on an industrial scale as it is a combination of anaerobic anoxic aerobic conditions within a reactor only 3 4 microbial community structure of dhs retained sludge fig 5 shows the dominant prokaryotic genera and eukaryotic groups in the influent seed sludge and sludge of the dhs reactor on days 62 run 1 159 run 2 and 282 run 4 this study obtained 847743 and 98614 sequences of the 16s and 18s rrna genes respectively were obtained dominant species of prokaryotic and eukaryotic communities clearly differed between the influent and the sludge in the dhs reactor suggesting that the effect of microorganism migration via the influent was insignificant in the prokaryotic community the alphaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria classes were dominant in all samples of the dhs reactor during the entire experimental period in this study various azo dye degrading bacteria genera such as acinetobacter phylum gammaproteobacteria leucobacter phylum actinobacteria and rhodobacter phylum alphaproteobacteria were detected in the dhs reactor 48 49 and their relative abundance changed depending on the operating conditions although acinetobacter was the most dominant prokaryotic genus in the dhs reactor on day 62 but its relative abundance decreased from run 2 whilst rhodobacter was the second most dominant on days 62 and 159 its detected rate decreased on day 282 in contrast leucobacter was predominantly detected in the dhs reactor on days 159 and 282 the difference in the azo dye degrading bacteria in each period may be due to large variation in color of the actual textile wastewater indeed the appearance of bacteria during processing depends on the type of dye used 50 the relative abundance of prokaryotic genera xanthobacter phylum alphaproteobacteria and mycobacterium phylum actinobacteria was greater in the dhs reactor on day 159 these bacteria can degrade aromatics and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs 51 increased levels of these bacteria may have resulted from the supply of substrate such as aromatic amines which are the primary metabolites of azo dye decolorization in the effluent of the dhs reactor in nitrogen cycle bacteria ammonia oxidizing bacteria nitrosomonas and nitrobacter was observed in all compartment of dhs reactor however the relative abundance of nitrosomonas and nitrobacter was comparably lower than our previous study 24 this low ammonia oxidizing bacteria abundance might be related to oxygen competition between other organic and or azo degrading bacteria 21 22 in nitrite oxidizing bacteria nitrospira was also observed after effluent recirculation was terminated although xanthobacter and mycobacterium decreased reyranella which can degrade pahs 52 increased in the middle bottom part of the dhs reactor on day 282 decreases in xanthobacter and mycobacterium may have resulted from changes in dye type in wastewater and the cessation of effluent recirculation however reyranella is capable of growing in the middle bottom part by utilizing pahs produced by azo dye decolorization by leucobacter which presented in top part of the dhs reactor during run 4 in this study the prokaryotic communities in the dhs reactor were observed to change as an adaptation to operating conditions i e effluent recirculation and the type of dye in the real textile wastewater protists and metazoa which are predators of bacteria were dominant in the dhs reactor the relative abundances of metazoa such as enchytraeus phylum annelida oscheius phylum nematoda and adineta phylum rotifera and uncultured fungi lkm11 phylum cryptomycota were highly detected in the dhs reactor on day 62 only the lkm11 group of fungi was also abundant in the seed sludge suggesting that they may influence the eukaryotic community in the dhs reactor during the first period protist groups such as stylonychia colpodida phylum ciliophora rhogostoma phylum cercozoa and uncultured lkm51 phylum ichthyosporea were more abundant on days 159 and 282 ciliophora and cercozoa were predominantly detected in the middle bottom part and the uncultured lkm51 group was predominated in all part of the dhs reactor although most metazoa groups decreased from day 62 the genus cuticularia was more abundant in the top part of the dhs reactor on days 159 and 282 therefore it is possible that the protist and metazoa communities in the dhs reactor may be influenced by effluent recirculation and longer hrt conditions moreover protists and metazoa were dominant in this dhs reactor suggesting that most of the eukaryotes could contribute to low excess sludge production however the function of uncultured lkm51 phylum ichthyosporea predominantly detected in dhs reactor is largely unknown the lkm51 eukaryotes were speculated to be saprotrophic and free living organisms 53 although further studies are needed to understand the role of lkm51 eukaryotes in textile wastewater treatment in a dhs reactor they play an important role in the anaerobic region of the sponge in the dhs reactor 4 conclusion the dhs reactor demonstrated a high treatment efficiency of low strength textile wastewater effluent recirculation was an effective method to enhance the removal of organics and nitrogen due to an increase in the oxygen transfer the dilution of influent concentration and repeated treatment in addition the presence of aromatic degrading bacteria and protists in the dhs reactor increased with effluent recirculation different dyes often require varying biological treatments so the combination of anaerobic anoxic aerobic within a dhs reactor can be a promising treatment method for textile wastewater at the industrial scale declaration of competing interest the authors report no

13727,the textile industry discharges large amounts of polluted wastewater containing synthetic dyes a down flow hanging sponge dhs reactor is a novel aerobic wastewater treatment process that utilizes a sponge as a biomass retaining carrier this sponge carrier has both aerobic and anaerobic zones owing to different dissolved oxygen concentrations in this study the process performance of a dhs reactor treating actual textile wastewater obtained from a factory in japan was evaluated the effects of hydraulic retention time hrt and effluent recirculation recirculation ratio 1 on the dhs process performance were investigated the dhs reactor showed good organic up to 93 13 of bod and nitrogen removal 56 14 of tn abilities during the entire experimental period the color removal efficiencies of the dhs reactor were 55 15 53 26 72 34 and 35 22 with hrts of 4 h 4 h effluent recirculation r 1 8 h effluent recirculation r 1 and 8 h respectively microbial community structure analysis of the dhs retained sludge showed that genus acinetobacter was detected predominantly and reported as an azo dye degrading bacterium effluent recirculation was also observed to increase the presence of aromatic degrading bacteria and protists in the dhs reactor these results suggest that the dhs reactor is suitable for textile wastewater treatment furthermore the effluent recirculation is effective for enhancing decolorization performance keywords textile wastewater trickling filter reactor biological wastewater treatment 1 introduction in recent years the rapid growth of the textile industry has been accompanied by constant concerns of the environmental problems relating to the wastewater accounting for nearly 1 of worldwide global gross domestic product gdp in 2018 however the textile industry is considered responsible for nearly 20 of the global industrial wastewater 1 in textile processing operation the wet processes of fabric namely desiring scouring bleaching mercerizing dyeing printing and other finishing stages are the main sources of liquid waste 2 therefore textile wastewater is made up of the contributions from various chemicals at each stage and typically characterized by high ph and turbidity poor biodegradability complex composition and especially high chrominance 3 highly colored effluent might be a result of the inefficient dyeing process where 20 50 of chromophore groups responsible for color in synthetic dye molecules escape from fabric attachment and release into environment 4 these hazardous substances may have severe effects on plant photosynthetic function if released into the soil environment and aquatic life due to low light penetration and oxygen consumption 2 thus dyeing wastewater needs to be treated before its discharge into the natural environment to date significant effort has been made by scientists to find a proper method for treating this wastewater however the fact that over 7 105 tons of dyes are synthesized worldwide every year 5 and continuous changes are made in their structure to meet the needs of improving color shades and colorfastness as a result the effective treatment of this recalcitrant wastewater remains a major knowledge gap that has attracted considerable scientific attention to treat this kind of wastewater physical oxidation and biological treatment technologies are currently used however physicaltreatment technology produces a large amount of excess sludge and records low decolorization efficiency while high operational cost and toxic byproduct generation have been known as concerns of the oxidation treatment method biological treatment technologies including anaerobic or aerobic treatment are one of the promising methods with cost effective and environmentally friendly advantages 2 modern dyes are designed to be recalcitrant for long term use and thus resistant to aerobic wastewater treatment 6 meanwhile the anaerobic method has been proven to be capable of treating dyeing wastewater under the supports of electron donating systems and different enzymes such as azo reductase laccase and peroxidase 7 thus so far several types of anaerobic reactors such as upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors 8 9 anaerobic baffled reactor 10 16 or strengthened circulation anaerobic reactor 3 have been applied to treat textile wastewater and achieved positive results nevertheless the most common disadvantage of anaerobic single phase treatment is the generation of aromatic amines toxic compounds but hard to be anaerobically degraded 11 a sequential anaerobic aerobic method therefore has been proposed to address these issues as a complete solution for textile dyeing wastewater treatment rabia shoukat et al 12 assessed the performance of combined anaerobic and aerobic sequence batch reactors sbr biosystem for real textile wastewater treatment and found that at 54 hours of hydraulic retention time hrt for the whole system 78 and 99 of color and total chemical oxygen demand cod were processed respectively in another study by m concetta tomei et al 13 the real textile wastewater was also treated in a sequential anaerobic sbr aerobic sbr system and achieved a color removal efficiency of 70 80 despite that these systems require a relatively long processing time which was approximately 24 72 h of hrt 14 16 and can be difficult to operate and control due to the connection of two separate reactors furthermore dye and its anaerobically decolorized products can inhibit the activity of obligate anaerobic microorganisms such as acetoclastic methanogens 17 a down flow hanging sponge dhs reactor seems to have the potential to solve those problems the dhs reactor is a biological trickling filter using sponges as a biomass retaining carrier and known as one of the most promising treatment systems for domestic sewage and industrial wastewaters 18 this is due to high retained sludge concentration excellent degradation efficiency high effluent quality and low operational costs 18 19 besides air naturally dissolves into the wastewater as it flows down in the sponge carrier thus the dhs reactor can perform high oxygen transfer without external aeration 20 the dhs reactor immobilizes active bacteria including not only aerobic but also anaerobic and anoxic bacteria inside a sponge that behaves as a biomass retaining carrier 18 21 22 this high microbial diversity in the dhs sponge carrier may be applicable as a combination of anaerobic and aerobic processes for textile wastewater treatment within a single reactor achieving an aerobic anoxic zone in a single dhs reactor has previously been reported in a single stage partial nitritation reactor 20 23 and in a dhs reactor for natural rubber processing wastewater treatment 24 this aerobic anoxic within a single reactor has also been achieved within a closed aquaculture system 25 the treatment of textile wastewater by using a dhs reactor with the addition of cationic polymers was demonstrated by tawfik et al 26 and achieved high organic loads no wash clogging problems high biomass retention time and high decolorization performance of the reactive dyes in this study a laboratory scale dhs reactor was continuously operated to develop an appropriate treatment system for treating low strength actual textile wastewater using the dhs reactor in japan without any additives the purpose of this study was to determine optimal operating conditions for the treatment of textile wastewater in particular the optimized hrt and effluent recirculation also 16s and 18s ribosomal ribonucleic acid rrna gene sequencing of dhs sponge retaining microorganisms were carried out to understand the microbial community structure 2 materials and methods 2 1 textile wastewater and system descriptions raw textile wastewater was collected from an equalization tank in a textile factory in niigata prefecture japan every two weeks the real textile

27 two 2 rows of sponges with 70 sponges each were symmetrically attached to each other and up to the 120 cm height of the dhs reactor the sponge volume of the dhs reactor was 2 0 l the hrt of the dhs reactor was calculated based on sponge volume anaerobic sludge obtained from a rotating biological conductor treating textile wastewater was inoculated into the dhs sponge carrier before the commencement of the experiment the mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss of the seed sludge was 8900 mg l 1 the wastewater was fed to the top of the reactor using a peristaltic pump following 50 days of operation a settling tank effective volume 1 l was installed to remove residual organic compounds the retention time of the settling tank was 2 0 to 4 0 hours the initial operational conditions of the dhs reactor are shown in table 1 the hrt and organic loading rate olr of the dhs reactor were calculated based on sponge volume from day 1 to day 49 the system was operated as a startup run at run 1 the hrt of the reactor was adjusted to 4 h the dhs effluent surface water of settling tank was recirculated to the influent to enhance organic and color removal in runs 2 and 3 the hrt was extended to 8 h to improve color removal during run 3 in run 4 the dhs reactor was operated without effluent recirculation 2 2 analytical methods samples were collected from the influent

discussion 3 1 organic and nitrogen removal the dhs reactor commenced at an olr of 1 6 kg cod m 3 day 1 table 2 presents a summary of the influent and effluent wastewater characterization during this experiment the bod removal efficiency of the dhs reactor immediately increased and was greater than 90 with 6 d of operation fig 2 however unexpected sludge washout was observed e g tss of effluent 272 mg l 1 on day 47 and the effluent quality from the dhs reactor deteriorated to address this issue a settling tank was installed on day 49 as post treatment following the dhs reactor to remove suspended solids in run 1 the dhs reactor was operated with an hrt of 4 h the total bod to total cod ratio of 0 22 0 04 in the influent indicated that the textile wastewater used in this study contained large amounts of slowly biodegradable organic compounds the influent and effluent total cod were 420 73 mg cod l 1 and 99 25 mg cod l 1 respectively during run 1 on the other hand a bod effluent of 6 2 4 8 mg l 1 showed that the dhs reactor removed most of the biodegradable organic compounds the bod removal efficiency was higher than a previous study using a dhs reactor for treating reactive dye wastewater 26 the effluent nitrate concentration of 5 0 4 3 mg n l 1 indicated that the dhs reactor performed nitrification of wastewater the dhs reactor also achieved a tn removal efficiency of 37 15 fig 3 the reduction of tn suggested that denitrification could occur in the dhs reactor in the dhs reactor machdar et al 36 observed that do gradient from 7 5 mg l 1 in the external layers of the sponge to approximately 0 2 mg l 1 in the inner layers 1 cm inside the sponge thus tn removal would occur to some anaerobic or anoxic degree in the dhs sponge carrier the tss and vss in the final effluent were 5 4 and 4 3 mg l 1 respectively during the operational period these results indicate that the dhs reactor has the potential to directly treat textile wastewater during run 2 the effluent of the dhs reactor was recirculated to the influent to enhance the removal of organics and nitrogen due to effluent recirculation the do of effluent increased 5 1 1 1 from 6 1 0 8 mg l 1 indicating that the oxygen transfer in the dhs reactor was enhanced by effluent circulation and sufficient do was supplied to the dhs reactor in the absence of external aeration in addition the cod and bod removal efficiencies of the reactor increased from 76 6 and 69 7 in run 1 to 81 6 and 76 8 in run 2 this enhancement of organic removal was potentially from 1 sufficient do being provided 2 effluent diluted the influent concentration and 3 some unbiodegradable compounds being degraded through the dhs reactor several times 24 37 the tn removal efficiency increased from 37 15 in run 1 to 49 11 in run 2 as oxidized nitrate was recirculated to the influent and converted to nitrogen gas hence effluent circulation was effective in removing organic and nitrogen in the dhs reactor in run 3 the dhs reactor was operated with an hrt of 8 h and effluent recirculation extending the hrt of the dhs reactor from 4 h to 8 h may lead to an increase in cod and bod removal efficiencies in run 3 the dhs reactor performed total cod and bod removal efficiencies of 83 8 and 93 12 respectively during this run the ammonia concentration of dhs influent and effluent were 5 7 3 4 mg n l 1 and 0 2 0 1 mg n l 1 correspondingly during this operational run likewise the tn removal efficiency increased to 56 14 tawfik et al 26 also reported improvement in organic and color removal with an extension of the hrt in a dhs reactor treating reactive dye wastewater based on these results it is clear that the simultaneous increase of the hrt from 4 h to 8 h and a decrease in the olr to 1 46 0 21 kg cod m 3 day 1 brings a significantly better performance of the reactor in terms of both organics and nitrogen removal in run 4 the dhs reactor was operated without effluent recirculation at an hrt of 8 h the cod and tn removal efficiencies deteriorated to 77 7 and 35 16 respectively this deterioration can be from residues of some non biodegradable organic compounds and generated nitrate in the effluent due to discontinuation of effluent recirculation in contrast the total bod removal efficiency reached its highest value of 98 1 with a Æ°i total bod in the effluent was 1 8 1 3 mg l because of the extension of sponge contacting time moreover most high nitrification rate was observed during this operational run therefore effluent recirculation may be an effective method for enhancing the removal of organics and nitrogen in the dhs reactor treating low strength textile wastewater overall in this study the optimal operating conditions for the dhs reactor were hrt of 8 h with effluent recirculation the dhs with an hrt of 4 h can achieve the discharge standards of japan i e total bod 120 mg l 1 tn 60 mg n l 1 as japan has not yet set color in the discharge standards 38 therefore the dhs reactor presents itself as an appropriate treatment system for textile wastewater 3 2 color removal as this study used actual textile wastewater it contains a wide variation in color based on the operational conditions of a textile factory thus the color removal efficiency of the dhs reactor was summarized by visual inspection of the influent color during each operating run table 3 blue wastewater was observed to be the most effectively removed in the dhs reactor with a removal efficiency of 62 84 the effective biodegradation of textile dye reactive blue has been reported in several previous studies 39 40 blue dyes used in the factory are more likely to be indigo dyes a common dye that produces the denim cloth for blue jeans and degraded by aerobic processes in a study by khelifi et al 41 a continuously combined aerobic bioprocess was applied to treat textile wastewater containing indigo dye and 97 of color removal efficiency was recorded besides the efficient aerobic treatment of blue dye was also reflected in run 2 and run 3 where the enhancement of oxygen concentration through effluent recirculation and an improvement in color removal efficiency took place simultaneously in contrast the removal of black and purple dyes in the wastewater were more effective in run 1 than in run 2 and run 4 outperformed run 3 in terms of color removal of purple textile wastewater these results suggest that effluent recirculation may adversely affect the decolorization of black and purple dyes by reducing the anaerobic anoxic area in the sponge carrier it is most likely that black and purple dyes were mostly eliminated anaerobically the black and purple dyes used may belong to the reactive dyes the most important dye class in the textile industry 43 and this dye group is reported to be degradable only in anaerobic digestion through azo bond cleaving process 44 3 3 do profiles in the dhs sponge carrier fig 4 shows the do concentration at different heights in the dhs reactor for different runs the do values in the sponge carriers largely differed from the hrt and effluent recirculation overall the do at 1 mm depth in the sponge was under 1 0 mg l 1 where conditions may be anaerobic or anoxic this low do concentration inside the sponge carriers is consistent with previous studies 20 21 at runs 1 and 4 the do inside the sponge ranged from 0 0 to 2 5 mg l 1 and 0 1 to 0 8 mg l 1 respectively following effluent recirculation the do increased to 5 0 mg l 1 at the bottom of the dhs reactor run 2 in contrast at reactor heights of 0 3 to 0 6 m the do concentration had significantly reduced and do may unitize the oxidation of organic and ammonia reactive dyes can be removed under anaerobic conditions 46 47 therefore this do variation in the sponge carriers is promising for textile dyeing wastewater on an industrial scale as it is a combination of anaerobic anoxic aerobic conditions within a reactor only 3 4 microbial community structure of dhs retained sludge fig 5 shows the dominant prokaryotic genera and eukaryotic groups in the influent seed sludge and sludge of the dhs reactor on days 62 run 1 159 run 2 and 282 run 4 this study obtained 847743 and 98614 sequences of the 16s and 18s rrna genes respectively were obtained dominant species of prokaryotic and eukaryotic communities clearly differed between the influent and the sludge in the dhs reactor suggesting that the effect of microorganism migration via the influent was insignificant in the prokaryotic community the alphaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria classes were dominant in all samples of the dhs reactor during the entire experimental period in this study various azo dye degrading bacteria genera such as acinetobacter phylum gammaproteobacteria leucobacter phylum actinobacteria and rhodobacter phylum alphaproteobacteria were detected in the dhs reactor 48 49 and their relative abundance changed depending on the operating conditions although acinetobacter was the most dominant prokaryotic genus in the dhs reactor on day 62 but its relative abundance decreased from run 2 whilst rhodobacter was the second most dominant on days 62 and 159 its detected rate decreased on day 282 in contrast leucobacter was predominantly detected in the dhs reactor on days 159 and 282 the difference in the azo dye degrading bacteria in each period may be due to large variation in color of the actual textile wastewater indeed the appearance of bacteria during processing depends on the type of dye used 50 the relative abundance of prokaryotic genera xanthobacter phylum alphaproteobacteria and mycobacterium phylum actinobacteria was greater in the dhs reactor on day 159 these bacteria can degrade aromatics and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs 51 increased levels of these bacteria may have resulted from the supply of substrate such as aromatic amines which are the primary metabolites of azo dye decolorization in the effluent of the dhs reactor in nitrogen cycle bacteria ammonia oxidizing bacteria nitrosomonas and nitrobacter was observed in all compartment of dhs reactor however the relative abundance of nitrosomonas and nitrobacter was comparably lower than our previous study 24 this low ammonia oxidizing bacteria abundance might be related to oxygen competition between other organic and or azo degrading bacteria 21 22 in nitrite oxidizing bacteria nitrospira was also observed after effluent recirculation was terminated although xanthobacter and mycobacterium decreased reyranella which can degrade pahs 52 increased in the middle bottom part of the dhs reactor on day 282 decreases in xanthobacter and mycobacterium may have resulted from changes in dye type in wastewater and the cessation of effluent recirculation however reyranella is capable of growing in the middle bottom part by utilizing pahs produced by azo dye decolorization by leucobacter which presented in top part of the dhs reactor during run 4 in this study the prokaryotic communities in the dhs reactor were observed to change as an adaptation to operating conditions i e effluent recirculation and the type of dye in the real textile wastewater protists and metazoa which are predators of bacteria were dominant in the dhs reactor the relative abundances of metazoa such as enchytraeus phylum annelida oscheius phylum nematoda and adineta phylum rotifera and uncultured fungi lkm11 phylum cryptomycota were highly detected in the dhs reactor on day 62 only the lkm11 group of fungi was also abundant in the seed sludge suggesting that they may influence the eukaryotic community in the dhs reactor during the first period protist groups such as stylonychia colpodida phylum ciliophora rhogostoma phylum cercozoa and uncultured lkm51 phylum ichthyosporea were more abundant on days 159 and 282 ciliophora and cercozoa were predominantly detected in the middle bottom part and the uncultured lkm51 group was predominated in all part of the dhs reactor although most metazoa groups decreased from day 62 the genus cuticularia was more abundant in the top part of the dhs reactor on days 159 and 282 therefore it is possible that the protist and metazoa communities in the dhs reactor may be influenced by effluent recirculation and longer hrt conditions moreover protists and metazoa were dominant in this dhs reactor suggesting that most of the eukaryotes could contribute to low excess sludge production however the function of uncultured lkm51 phylum ichthyosporea predominantly detected in dhs reactor is largely unknown the lkm51 eukaryotes were speculated to be saprotrophic and free living organisms 53 although further studies are needed to understand the role of lkm51 eukaryotes in textile wastewater treatment in a dhs reactor they play an important role in the anaerobic region of the sponge in the dhs reactor 4 conclusion the dhs reactor demonstrated a high treatment efficiency of low strength textile wastewater effluent recirculation was an effective method to enhance the removal of organics and nitrogen due to an increase in the oxygen transfer the dilution of influent concentration and repeated treatment in addition the presence of aromatic degrading bacteria and protists in the dhs reactor increased with effluent recirculation different dyes often require varying biological treatments so the combination of anaerobic anoxic aerobic within a dhs reactor can be a promising treatment method for textile wastewater at the industrial scale declaration of competing interest the authors report no

13728,this study focuses on the modelling and optimization of process variables for the immobilization of activated sludge in polyvinyl alcohol pva alginate cryogel beads using response surface methodology rsm the results from analysis of variance showed that the models were reliable and significant in predicting the biodegradation rate and beads breakage the interaction effects of the five independent variables namely number of freezing thawing cycle bead size as well as pva alginate and cacl2 concentrations were statistically analyzed using central composite design ccd alginate concentration was classified by models for contributing the most significant effect on both responses the interactions between alginate concentration with cacl2 concentration alginate concentration with number of freezing thawing cycle and alginate concentration with bead size significantly affected the performances of cryogel beads on p nitrophenol pnp biodegradation rate and beads breakage the predicted results were in conformity with the experimental runs in which the maximum pnp biodegradation rate of 7 4 mg l h and minimum breakage of 0 could be achieved using 8 0 wt of pva 1 411 wt of sodium alginate 3 012 wt of cacl2 3 659 mm of bead and 3 cycles for freezing thawing process at low initial pnp concentration of 100 mg l the pva alginate as cryogel beads were reusable with no significant loss in pnp biodegradation efficiency for 20 consecutive biodegradation cycles keywords immobilization pva alginate cryogel optimization interaction effect p nitrophenol activated sludge 1 introduction p nitrophenol pnp is categorized by united states environmental agency us epa as a priority pollutant that contaminates the water source in view of its properties of high toxicity and bioaccumulation rate owing to its widespread usage the deployment of efficient treatment technologies assumes significance in reducing the concentrations below the threshold limits and thus alleviating the detriment to human and environment upon the disposals studies have shown that a variety of microorganism employed in biological treatment approaches exhibited high potential in utilizing pnp as carbon source under aerobic and anaerobic conditions 1 4 the conventional biological method i e activated sludge process offers possibilities for complete mineralization of organic pollutants however it often experiences numerous limitations such as large reactor volume requirement excess sludge production and inhibited microbial activities at high contaminant concentration 5 6 consequently immobilization technologies such as encapsulation entrapment adsorption and surface binding are receiving research interests to minimizing those limitations and achieving more effective operating systems 7 8 these applications of biomass immobilization help in advancing the tolerance against harsh environments as well as improving the biocatalyst stability and bioprocess control 9 11 entrapment of microorganisms in polymeric matrix is a simple and common biomass immobilization technique it involves gelation of polyionic polymers by adding multi valent counter ions 12 various polymeric materials such as sodium alginate 12 chitosan 5 13 polyacrylamide 14 and polyvinyl alcohol pva 8 13 15 were widely employed as matrices for the preparation of polymeric hydrogels with porous network properties and flexibility however the application of hydrogel is restricted by inadequate mechanical strength poor toughness and limited reusability 17 recent development in cryogelation using freezing thawing method has demonstrated its efficiency for bioprocess application 18 the unique combination of properties of macroporosity physical and chemical stabilities biocompatibility and tissue like elasticity renders cryogels for various potential applications in wastewater treatment 19 20 in this study alginate and pva were selected as the precursor polymer materials to synthesize cryogel despite the numerous studies conducted on the immobilization for wastewater treatment limited information is available regarding the research on pnp degradation by immobilized biomass many studies on optimization for bacteria or enzyme immobilization condition using conventional sequential optimization approach have been reported won et al 12 investigated different immobilization conditions bead size ratio of enzyme weight to alginate alginate and cacl2 concentrations for lipase entrapment by ca alginate gel beads el naas et al 10 also optimized the conditions for immobilizing pseudomonas putida in pva gel using the conventional way the conventional sequential optimization of single parameter at once is less economical time consuming and oftentimes the interactive effects of various parameters are overlooked 21 22 however these limitations can be diminished by using statistical design of experiment such as response surface methodology rsm application of rsm for bioprocess optimization has been reported by several studies 21 23 26 in addition to statistical analysis rsm allows various parameters and their interaction effects within the design space of experimental study to be simultaneously studied and optimized it also offers reduced number of experiments and minimized errors in determining the effects of process variables central composite design ccd in rsm is preferred in terms of accuracy of experiment and information that can be obtained for instance combined effects of controllable parameters and uniformity of error distribution 27 28 this approach is useful and ideal for sequential experimentation considering the use of relatively few variables combinations for the determination of complex response function 24 26 to the best of our knowledge the information of multivariate statistical optimization in biomass immobilization of cryogel for pnp biodegradation is lacking therefore this study aims to i investigate the statistical relationships between five independent factors i e bead size number of freeze thawing cycles pva sodium alginate and cacl2 concentrations and the efficacy of cyrogel beads in biodegrading pnp ii determine the optimum operational conditions using rsm ccd and iii assess the reusability of optimized immobilized cryogel beads for pnp biodegradation 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals the solid pnp of synthesis grade 99 purity was purchased from merck chemicals germany sodium alginate and polyvinyl alcohol pva mw 89000 98000 g mol were purchased from r m chemicals and sigma aldrich germany respectively and used without further purification other chemicals used for preparation feed solution for activated sludge were purchased from bendosen and r m chemicals malaysia 2 2 culturing of the pnp acclimated activated sludge a 5 l sequencing batch reactor sbr with operation phases of 2 h fill 12 h aerobic react 1 5 h settle 1 h draw and 7 5 h idle was constructed the seed of the activated sludge obtained from a municipal wastewater treatment plant located at batu ferringhi penang malaysia was fed with the base mix containing in mg l sucrose 563 and bactopeptone 188 nahco3 500 nh4 2so4 212 k2hpo4 180 kh2po4 32 mgso4 49 fecl3 6h2o 18 8 and cacl2 40 during acclimation process the sucrose and bactopeptone were gradually substituted by pnp the final pnp acclimation concentration was 500 mg l after the attainment of steady state the pnp acclimated activated sludge was collected for the immobilization studies 2 3 activated sludge immobilization in pva alginate cryogels the procedure of activated sludge entrapment was carried out following the method described by others with modifications 6 16 29 the collected pnp acclimated activated sludge was centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 5 min the supernatant was discarded and the activated sludge was resuspended in distilled water the activated sludge was then blended with the pre dissolved pva and sodium alginate to constitute a biopolymeric matrix throughout the study the initial activated sludge concentration in the matrix was fixed at 2 0 g wet wt 100 ml gel subsequently the biopolymeric solution was added dropwise into calcium chloride solution through a needle terumo 18 g 21 g or 23 g or glass dropper to form spherical hydrogel beads of different diameters the diameters of twenty beads were measured using vernier calipers proskit and then expressed in terms of mean the beads were then mixed gently in calcium chloride solution for about 4 h for complete crosslinking next the beads were washed with distilled water with aeration for several times to remove excessive unpolymerized residue subsequently the hydrogel beads were subjected to freezing at 20 c for 18 h followed by thawing at 4 c for 6 h the freezing thawing process was done for few cycles after all cycles were completed the resulted pva alginate as cryogel beads were aerated in nutrient solution for 12 h and they were ready to use for pnp biodegradation the procedure was repeated without the addition of activated sludge to produce pva alginate cryogel beads as control based on the preliminary experiment data not shown the adsorption of pnp onto pva alginate cryogel beads was negligible within the biodegradation period 2 4 experimental design the experiment design in this study was conducted using ccd method the five variable parameters investigated were bead size mm sodium alginate concentration w v pva concentration w v calcium chloride concentration w v and number of freezing thawing cycle a total of 32 runs half function condition were performed and augmented with 6 replications at design center to assess the pure error table 1 the low center and high levels of each variable were designated as 1 0 1 respectively the experimental levels for each variable were determined based on preliminary tests in which no tear shaped bead was formed the pnp biodegradation rate mg l h and breakage were considered as dependent variables responses in this study design expert version 8 0 7 1 stat ease inc minneapolis mn 55413 was used to devise experiments as well as to analyze the regression and graphical experimental data obtained analysis of variance anova was applied for statistical analysis of experimental data to obtain interactions between the variables and the responses the quality of the fitted polynomial model was expressed by the coefficients of determination of r2 and radj 2 and its statistical significance was verified by the adequate precision f fisher variation ratio and probability prob f values 22 24 26 in consideration of multiple responses the desirability function approach was applied to identify the optimized condition that simultaneously produce the most desirable responses on the dependent variables 24 30 2 5 characterization of cryogel beads 2 5 1 morphological observation the pva alginate as cryogel beads were rinsed with distilled before viewing using optical microscope olympus sz 61 with camera dp 21 from olympus corporation japan both morphologies of pva alginate cryogel and pva alginate as cryogel beads were observed using field emission scanning electron microscope quanta 650 field emission gun sem holland the beads were rinsed with distilled water and cut into halves with a sterile scalpel to get cross sectional area of beads the beads were then exposed to 2 w v osmium tetroxide for 2 h and freeze dried under nitrogen atmosphere 210 c for 6 h the dried samples were sputter coated with gold prior for sem observation the procedure was repeated for pva alginate cryogel beads 2 5 2 analysis of relative mechanical resistance the mechanical stability study was modified based on wang s method 31 a hundred cryogel beads 50 granules of glass beads 5 mm in diameter and 5 ml of distilled water were added in a 50 ml laboratory bottle it was then stirred at 180 rpm for 8 h the number of remaining intact beads was recorded the determination of beads breakage percentage was conducted using eq 1 1 b e a d s b r e a k a g e n i n t n i 100 where ni is the initial number of beads and nt is the final number of intact beads left after stirring 2 6 biodegradation batch studies the pva alginate as cryogel beads prepared under different conditions table 1 were introduced into the solution containing nutrients and 100 mg l pnp with aeration the residual pnp concentration in the bulk solution was monitored by sampling at regular intervals until pnp was completely degraded the pnp concentration was determined spectrophotometrically at Î»max of 401 nm using a uv vis spectrophotometer shimadzu uv 2600 japan 32 the experiments were conducted in duplicates and the mean values were reported 2 7 reusability of pva alginate as cryogels the reusability of pva alginate as cryogel beads was studied by repeatedly using the same batch of cryogel beads for successive pnp biodegradations after each cycle of degradation the beads were washed using distilled water and then transferred into the solution containing nutrients and pnp 100 mg l for subsequent biodegradation cycle during the biodegradation process the time course of residual pnp concentration was recorded optical density at regular time interval was also determined at Î»max of 600 nm to monitor the leakage of activated sludge the reusability experiment was terminated once disintegration or leakage of activated sludge was observed to investigate the effects of initial pnp concentration on the mechanical strength of pva alginate as cryogel beads and biodegradation rate the reusability study was repeated using higher pnp concentration 500 mg l 3 results and discussion 3 1 morphology of pva alginate and pva alginate as cryogel beads fig 1 a and b show the appearance of pva alginate and pva alginate as cryogel beads respectively the brownish color of pva alginate as cryogel bead indicates that the activated sludge was successfully entrapped in pva alginate cryogel the pva alginate as cryogel bead remained intact after 20 cycles of pnp biodegradation fig 1 c from the sem image of cross sectional surface of a pva alginate cryogel bead fig 1 d irregular sized pores are found unevenly distributed the porous structure of pva alginate is crucial in promoting the diffusion or transportation of substrate molecules from external environment into the inner part of beads or vice versa 6 after immobilization of activated sludge the clumps of biomass can be observed distributed or attached on the filaments that comprised the network fig 1 e 3 2 statistical analysis using anova the ccd design stands on empirical design in relating the relationship and interrelationship between the factors with responses via quadratic equation which follows second order polynomial response surface equation table 1 presents the experimental matrices based on ccd design with actual values of the independent variables and the respective two responses biodegradation rate and breakage upon eliminating those insignificant model terms that did not affect the model hierarchical the final regression models in terms of coded process variables were obtained and shown as below 2

are highlighted in tables 2 and 3 the aptness of these models was confirmed by the f and p values the models f values of 135 06 and 38 30 indicate the significance of the models for biodegradation rate and breakage percentage respectively the results showed that only 0 01 chance that an f value this large could occur due to noise a p value of 0 05 underscores the model significance in contrast a p values of greater than 0 10 typically implies the statistical inadequacy the lack of fits f test denotes the variation of the data scattering the fitted model a p value of 0 10 for lack of fit is desired to support the model with a negligible pure error furthermore r2 and adjusted r2 values are required to be close to 1 0 as these values advocate a high correlation between the observed and predicted values in this study for both models the results implied the significant correlation between the process variables and responses 33 in addition the predicted r2 values were in reasonable agreement with the adjusted r2 for the developed models therefore the total dissimilarity was merely 2 the models adequate precisions of greater than 4 0 58 78 and 15 01 for eqs 2 and 3 respectively denoting an adequate signal and the models can thus be used to navigate the design space adequate approximation to the real system by the selected model is important the normal probability plots of the studentized residuals and diagnostics can help to judge and validate the model satisfactoriness from fig 2 a it can be noticed that the data for the responses of biodegradation rate and bead breakage follows normal distribution also for both cases the real and predicted values were in good similarity as indicated by the close distribution of actual experimental data to the straight line of predicted values fig 2 b 3 3 effects of interactive variables on the responses 3 3 1 pnp biodegradation rate based on the developed models the comparative effects of all independent variables on pnp biodegradation rate are presented in the perturbation plots fig 3 from the figure the sharp curvature of alginate concentration c indicates its most significant effect on pnp biodegradation rate relatively gentle slope can be observed for the variables of cacl2 concentration d and freezing thawing cycle e similar phenomenon was observed by won et al 2005 studying the effects of alginate and cacl2 concentrations on the loading efficiency and immobilization yield it was reported that the effect of alginate concentration was greater compared to that of cacl2 concentration nonetheless in this study the increase of cacl2 concentration resulted in an increment in pnp biodegradation rate besides a slight drop of nearly plateau curve of bead size a could be noticed beyond the 0 coded unit implying a decrease of biodegradation rate at larger bead size this can be explained by the increase in diffusion limitation at increasing bead size and thus lower substrate removal rate 5 6 34 a slight increment of the pva concentration b curvature towards 1 0 coded unit was noted this trend could be plausibly explained by the structural changes of pva alginate as cryogel beads in becoming less porous at higher pva concentration and thus resulted in unfavorable effects to the substrate transfer and the bacterial growth 15 the fitted 3d response surface and their respective 2d contour plots fig 4 were constructed to investigate the optimum level of each variable and their interactions on pnp biodegradation rate the surface plots were constructed for pair wise combination with other factors set at their middle levels 0 coded as shown in previous perturbation plot fig 3 the biodegradation slowed down at increasing alginate concentration from anova analysis the interactions between alginate concentration and cacl2 concentration freeze thawing cycle or the bead size fig 4 had significant impact on pnp biodegradation rate other interactions among the variables are placed at lower significance level fig s1 as accentuated by the peak in fig 4 a the optimum pnp biodegradation rate could be attained using smaller bead at lower alginate concentration similar result was reported by toh et al 6 in which smaller pva alginate hydrogel beads of 3 mm exhibited the fastest rate of o cresol biodegradation compared to the bigger bead sizes of 4 5 and 6 mm this phenomenon was associated to the increased path length for the substrate movement to biomass for biodegradation due to the impenetrable part of polymer thus increasing bead size led to the greater mass transfer limitation leading to low biodegradation rate from fig 4 b the maximum degradation rate took place at cacl2 concentration between 2 5 and 3 5 at lower limit of alginate concentration the lack of ca2 ion as the crosslinker caused insufficient gelation however excessive cacl2 gave rise to low microbial activity due to high osmotic pressure of salt that resulted in less efficient diffusion of substrate into the beads 15 for the interaction between alginate concentration and number of freezing thawing cycle fig 4 c significant effect was imposed on biodegradation rate at high alginate concentration conversely little influence on biodegradation rate was observed at low limit of alginate concentration sem images for cross sectional surface of pva alginate cyrogel beads prepared using 1 and 2 alginate with 3 and 5 freezing thawing cycles are shown in fig 5 at low alginate concentration fig 5 a and b the porosity was not affected significantly by the number of freezing thawing cycle in comparison at higher alginate concentration more polymer rich region with lesser porosity was observed fig 5 c and d this resulted in an increase in the time required for the movement of substrate and thus a lower biodegradation rate at higher alginate concentration of 2 an existence of void around the boundaries of cryogel bead was noticed for 3 cycles of freezing thawing see arrow fig 5 c however no void was observed for 5 cycles of freezing thawing fig 5 d the effect of number of freezing thawing cycle was further investigated by comparing the extent of diffusion limitation the extent of diffusion limitation can be assessed in term of effectiveness factor Î· 6 as shown in eq 6 Î· is defined as the ratio of the biodegradation rate of immobilized biomass with diffusion limitation Î½i and biodegradation rate of suspended biomass without diffusion limitation Î½s 6 Î· Î½ i Î½ s the smaller the Î· value the greater the diffusion limitation by comparing the effectiveness factor for 2 cryogel beads the beads with higher number of freezing thawing cycle exhibited smaller Î· value indicating the higher diffusion resistance the ratio of 0 92 and 0 67 for 3 and 5 freeze thaw cycles respectively were obtained by comparing each biodegradation rate with the biodegradation rate for 1 cycle of freeze thaw process Î· 3 o r 5 Î· 1 the results indicated that higher number of freeze thaw cycle would exert higher diffusion limitation the difficulty of penetration of substrate into the interior of beads increased with increasing freezing thawing was attributed to the denser polymer network formed this observation is consistent with the study conducted by stauffer and peppast 35 they observed a reduction of 62 in diffusion coefficient at fifth freezing thawing cycle when compared with that at second cycle indicating the increase in diffusion limitation 3 3 2 response of beads breakage for the response of bead breakage as denoted by the sharp curvatures in the perturbation plot fig 6 all variables except number of freezing thawing cycle e were found to be responsible for the enhancement of mechanical stability of pva alginate as cryogel beads the significant effect of bead size a was indicated by sharp curvature in which minimum breakage was achieved at 0 coded point before or beyond that point reduction of mechanical stability was demonstrated this trend is plausibly explained by the density of the polymer network the slope of pva concentration b increased sharply with increasing concentration indicating the enhancement of cryogel bead strength with higher pva concentration at high pva concentration the crosslinking of pva occurred easily and gave rise to an increase in the number of crosslink junction consequently the polymer mesh became denser and hence the gel strength increased 36 37 similar curvature was observed for the variables of alginate concentration c and cacl2 concentration d dong et al 15 reported that the bead mechanical stability was affected by alginate concentration in which the higher the alginate concentration the greater the gel strength however beyond the optimum alginate concentration the beads were too hard and hence hindered the cell growth similarly crosslinker cacl2 possessed optimum operative concentration to achieve complete crosslinking in gel formation the comparatively plateau curvature for number of freeze thawing cycle e shown in this study suggested its low sensitivity on breakage this is in contrast with the results reported by holloway et al 38 in which increased strength of pva cryogels with increasing number of freeze thawing cycles was detected due to the formation of denser polymer network mesh by studying the interaction effects of independent variables on breakage fig 7 it was affirmed that the factor of alginate concentration showed significant impact in making stable cryogel beads minimum breakage could be attained at the optimal alginate concentration between 1 2 1 6 cross linking between alginate c and ca2 ions d led to gelation thus sufficient amount of alginate and ca2 ions were required to produce mechanically stable beads with minimum breakage in this study calcium chloride ranging from 2 0 3 0 was deduced as the optimal concentration the freezing thawing process contributes to the formation of physically crosslinked matrix consisting crystalline and amorphous regions the increase in freezing thawing cycle increases the mechanical properties 36 however in this study the enhancement of beads stability by increasing the freezing thawing cycle was only attained at lower range of alginate concentration fig 7 b the increasing number of freezing thawing cycle induced the extent of polymer association and the polymer mesh became denser as shown in the sem images fig 5 a and b the results is corroborated with the findings reported by chhatri et al 39 in which the crosslinking density and thus the gel strength could be improved by increasing the number of freezing thawing cycle it had also been reported that the hydrogels with higher crosslink density exhibited higher mechanical strength 37 nonetheless a reversed pattern was observed at higher alginate concentration where the breakage increased with increasing freezing thawing cycles similar observation was reported by millon et al 40 in which the mechanical strength of pva cryogel leveled off when all available polymers were tied up in the mesh after seven cycles 38 40 it was also proposed that when the polymer association brought by the freezing thawing process exceeded a certain limit further freezing thawing would led to over association and thus the decrease of gel strength 41 interaction effects of alginate concentration and pva concentration with bead size on bead breakage are depicted in fig 7 c and d respectively as indicated by the uniform elongated pattern in the 2 d contour plot the interaction effect between these variables on bead breakage was significant and two trends could be observed the breakage percentage increased with increasing bead sizes at low polymer concentration and this is associated with the density of the polymer network at low polymer concentration bigger bead size resulted in less dense polymer network and thus the expanded conformation in comparison the smaller beads were found to be easily broken at high polymer concentration as discussed earlier alginate concentration was an important factor in deciding the mechanical stability dong et al reported good bead stability for immobilized cells at 1 1 of alginate however beyond this optimum concentration it became too hard 15 at high polymer concentration the polymer was packed densely in small bead with low flexibility and thus brittle easily when the bead size increased reduction in breakage percentage was observed in this study the least percentage of bead breakage approaching 0 could be achieved using low alginate concentration 1 4 and small bead size 3 0 mm fig 7 c based on the results in fig 7 d minimum bead breakage could be obtained at pva concentration between 5 6 and bead size less than 3 5 mm other interactions of different variable combination were of less significance on breakage and are shown as supplementary results fig s2 3 4 process variables optimization and validation the optimization process was conducted to determine the optimal level of each variable for maximizing the responses using desirability function method in the software the desired goal for each variable was set independently within the range the response of pnp biodegradation was placed at maximum to attain the fastest biodegradation rate whereas the breakage was set at the minimum to achieve the greatest mechanical stability the software combined individual desirability into a single number in searches to maximizing the function based on the response goal the optimum conditions and the respective responses were established and a preferred solution was chosen considering the relative ease in the preparation of pva alginate as cryogel beads a biodegradation rate of 7 4 mg l h and 0 of breakage were predicted according to the model under optimized conditions bead size 3 659 mm pva concentration 8 0 wt alginate concentration 1 411 wt cacl2 concentration 3 012 wt and number of freezing thawing cycle 3 the desirability function value was found to be 0 723 for these predicted optimum conditions an additional experiment run was then conducted in duplicate according to the optimum condition to verify the validity and accuracy of the model the results obtained pnp biodegradation rate of 8 0 mg l h and breakage percentage of 10 agreed well with the predicted response value 3 5 reusability of pva alginate as cryogels the pva alginate as cryogel beads produced under optimized conditions was repeatedly used for pnp biodegradation process when dealing with low initial pnp concentration of 100 mg l the pva alginate as cryogel beads preserved a high degrading ability after 20 cycles without any leakage of biomass or disintegration this phenomenon is corroborated with the results reported by dong et al 15 they showed that the denitrifying capacity and activity of immobilized ammonia oxidizing bacteria in pva alginate gel was retained after 5 cycles although the pva alginate as cryogel beads did not break the beads became larger in size fig 1 a and softer as compared to the original beads there are two possible reasons to explain the physical appearance change of reused beads biomass growth or swelling effect the biomass growth could lead to saturation within the bead resulting in the expansion of the bead wall meanwhile the latter was related to the osmotic equilibrium and restoration of elastic pressure the substrate solution diffused into the beads and attempted to achieving osmotic balance while the polymer network provided a restoring elastic pressure and maintained the structure integrity however the elasticity was weakened by the strong osmotic pressure over the recycling time when initial pnp concentration was increased to 500 mg l the disintegration of beads was noticed earlier at the end of the fourth cycle the disintegration may be caused by the excessive growth of biomass under high supply of substrate this phenomenon was in coherent with the results reported by other researchers 5 6 in this study the reaction period for biodegradation of 500 mg l pnp was four times longer than that of 100 mg l thus this led to the deterioration of mechanical strength of the beads due to swelling effect as described above the corresponding pnp biodegradation rates at different initial pnp concentrations 100 and 500 mg l for each cycle are shown in table 4 interestingly remarkable increase in the biodegradation rate with increasing cycle of use was observed this increasing trend could be plausibly explained by the biomass growth within the beads after each cycle of use however at initial pnp concentration of 100 mg l the biodegradation rate reached a constant value after 10 cycles this could be due to the diffusion limitations of substrate molecules from the bulk phase into the beads 4 conclusion the ccd was exploited in this study to optimize the interactive factors namely bead size number of freezing thawing cycle pva alginate and cacl2 concentrations on pnp biodegradation rate and beads breakage the results clearly demonstrated that both derived models were satisfying for prediction as indicated by the statistical significance among the five variables alginate concentration had the most prominent influence on both dependent variables in addition the interactions of alginate concentration with cacl2 concentration number of freezing thawing cycle and bead size exhibited significant impact on both responses the optimized conditions for the immobilization process were bead size 3 659 mm pva concentration 8 0 wt alginate concentration 1 411 wt cacl2 concentration 3 012 wt and number of freezing thawing cycle 3 fast pnp biodegradation rate 8 0 mg l h and minimum beads breakage 10 were obtained experimentally and the results agreed with predicted values by rsm ccd the reusability of pva alginate as cryogel beads was dependent on the initial pnp concentration declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements this research was supported by

introduction p nitrophenol pnp is categorized by united states environmental agency us epa as a priority pollutant that contaminates the water source in view of its properties of high toxicity and bioaccumulation rate owing to its widespread usage the deployment of efficient treatment technologies assumes significance in reducing the concentrations below the threshold limits and thus alleviating the detriment to human and environment upon the disposals studies have shown that a variety of microorganism employed in biological treatment approaches exhibited high potential in utilizing pnp as carbon source under aerobic and anaerobic conditions 1 4 the conventional biological method i e activated sludge process offers possibilities for complete mineralization of organic pollutants however it often experiences numerous limitations such as large reactor volume requirement excess sludge production and inhibited microbial activities at high contaminant concentration 5 6 consequently immobilization technologies such as encapsulation entrapment adsorption and surface binding are receiving research interests to minimizing those limitations and achieving more effective operating systems 7 8 these applications of biomass immobilization help in advancing the tolerance against harsh environments as well as improving the biocatalyst stability and bioprocess control 9 11 entrapment of microorganisms in polymeric matrix is a simple and common biomass immobilization technique it involves gelation of polyionic polymers by adding multi valent counter ions 12 various polymeric materials such as sodium alginate 12 chitosan 5 13 polyacrylamide 14 and polyvinyl alcohol pva 8 13 15 were widely employed as matrices for the preparation of polymeric hydrogels with porous network properties and flexibility however the application of hydrogel is restricted by inadequate mechanical strength poor toughness and limited reusability 17 recent development in cryogelation using freezing thawing method has demonstrated its efficiency for bioprocess application 18 the unique combination of properties of macroporosity physical and chemical stabilities biocompatibility and tissue like elasticity renders cryogels for various potential applications in wastewater treatment 19 20 in this study alginate and pva were selected as the precursor polymer materials to synthesize cryogel despite the numerous studies conducted on the immobilization for wastewater treatment limited information is available regarding the research on pnp degradation by immobilized biomass many studies on optimization for bacteria or enzyme immobilization condition using conventional sequential optimization approach have been reported won et al 12 investigated different immobilization conditions bead size ratio of enzyme weight to alginate alginate and cacl2 concentrations for lipase entrapment by ca alginate gel beads el naas et al 10 also optimized the conditions for immobilizing pseudomonas putida in pva gel using the conventional way the conventional sequential optimization of single parameter at once is less economical time consuming and oftentimes the interactive effects of various parameters are overlooked 21 22 however these limitations can be diminished by using statistical design of experiment such as response surface methodology rsm application of rsm for bioprocess optimization has been reported by several studies 21 23 26 in addition to statistical analysis rsm allows various parameters and their interaction effects within the design space of experimental study to be simultaneously studied and optimized it also offers reduced number of experiments and minimized errors in determining the effects of process variables central composite design ccd in rsm is preferred in terms of accuracy of experiment and information that can be obtained for instance combined effects of controllable parameters and uniformity of error distribution 27 28 this approach is useful and ideal for sequential experimentation considering the use of relatively few variables combinations for the determination of complex response function 24 26 to the best of our knowledge the information of multivariate statistical optimization in biomass immobilization of cryogel for pnp biodegradation is lacking therefore this study aims to i investigate the statistical relationships between five independent factors i e bead size number of freeze thawing cycles pva sodium alginate and cacl2 concentrations and the efficacy of cyrogel beads in biodegrading pnp ii determine the optimum operational conditions using rsm ccd and iii assess the reusability of optimized immobilized cryogel beads for pnp biodegradation 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals the solid pnp of synthesis grade 99 purity was purchased from merck chemicals germany sodium alginate and polyvinyl alcohol pva mw 89000 98000 g mol were purchased from r m chemicals and sigma aldrich germany respectively and used without further purification other chemicals used for preparation feed solution for activated sludge were purchased from bendosen and r m chemicals malaysia 2 2 culturing of the pnp acclimated activated sludge a 5 l sequencing batch reactor sbr with operation phases of 2 h fill 12 h aerobic react 1 5 h settle 1 h draw and 7 5 h idle was constructed the seed of the activated sludge obtained from a municipal wastewater treatment plant located at batu ferringhi penang malaysia was fed with the base mix containing in mg l sucrose 563 and bactopeptone 188 nahco3 500 nh4 2so4 212 k2hpo4 180 kh2po4 32 mgso4 49 fecl3 6h2o 18 8 and cacl2 40 during acclimation process the sucrose and bactopeptone were gradually substituted by pnp the final pnp acclimation concentration was 500 mg l after the attainment of steady state the pnp acclimated activated sludge was collected for the immobilization studies 2 3 activated sludge immobilization in pva alginate cryogels the procedure of activated sludge entrapment was carried out following the method described by others with modifications 6 16 29 the collected pnp acclimated activated sludge was centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 5 min the supernatant was discarded and the activated sludge was resuspended in distilled water the activated sludge was then blended with the pre dissolved pva and sodium alginate to constitute a biopolymeric matrix throughout the study the initial activated sludge concentration in the matrix was fixed at 2 0 g wet wt 100 ml gel subsequently the biopolymeric solution was added dropwise into calcium chloride solution through a needle terumo 18 g 21 g or 23 g or glass dropper to form spherical hydrogel beads of different diameters the diameters of twenty beads were measured using vernier calipers proskit and then expressed in terms of mean the beads were then mixed gently in calcium chloride solution for about 4 h for complete crosslinking next the beads were washed with distilled water with aeration for several times to remove excessive unpolymerized residue subsequently the hydrogel beads were subjected to freezing at 20 c for 18 h followed by thawing at 4 c for 6 h the freezing thawing process was done for few cycles after all cycles were completed the resulted pva alginate as cryogel beads were aerated in nutrient solution for 12 h and they were ready to use for pnp biodegradation the procedure was repeated without the addition of activated sludge to produce pva alginate cryogel beads as control based on the preliminary experiment data not shown the adsorption of pnp onto pva alginate cryogel beads was negligible within the biodegradation period 2 4 experimental design the experiment design in this study was conducted using ccd method the five variable parameters investigated were bead size mm sodium alginate concentration w v pva concentration w v calcium chloride concentration w v and number of freezing thawing cycle a total of 32 runs half function condition were performed and augmented with 6 replications at design center to assess the pure error table 1 the low center and high levels of each variable were designated as 1 0 1 respectively the experimental levels for each variable were determined based on preliminary tests in which no tear shaped bead was formed the pnp biodegradation rate mg l h and breakage were considered as dependent variables responses in this study design expert version 8 0 7 1 stat ease inc minneapolis mn 55413 was used to devise experiments as well as to analyze the regression and graphical experimental data obtained analysis of variance anova was applied for statistical analysis of experimental data to obtain interactions between the variables and the responses the quality of the fitted polynomial model was expressed by the coefficients of determination of r2 and radj 2 and its statistical significance was verified by the adequate precision f fisher variation ratio and probability prob f values 22 24 26 in consideration of multiple responses the desirability function approach was applied to identify the optimized condition that simultaneously produce the most desirable responses on the dependent variables 24 30 2 5 characterization of cryogel beads 2 5 1 morphological observation the pva alginate as cryogel beads were rinsed with distilled before viewing using optical microscope olympus sz 61 with camera dp 21 from olympus corporation japan both morphologies of pva alginate cryogel and pva alginate as cryogel beads were observed using field emission scanning electron microscope quanta 650 field emission gun sem holland the beads were rinsed with distilled water and cut into halves with a sterile scalpel to get cross sectional area of beads the beads were then exposed to 2 w v osmium tetroxide for 2 h and freeze dried under nitrogen atmosphere 210 c for 6 h the dried samples were sputter coated with gold prior for sem observation the procedure was repeated for pva alginate cryogel beads 2 5 2 analysis of relative mechanical resistance the mechanical stability study was modified based on wang s method 31 a hundred cryogel beads 50 granules of glass beads 5 mm in diameter and 5 ml of distilled water were added in a 50 ml laboratory bottle it was then stirred at 180 rpm for 8 h the number of remaining intact beads was recorded the determination of beads breakage percentage was conducted using eq 1 1 b e a d s b r e a k a g e n i n t n i 100 where ni is the initial number of beads and nt is the final number of intact beads left after stirring 2 6 biodegradation batch studies the pva alginate as cryogel beads prepared under different conditions table 1 were introduced into the solution containing nutrients and 100 mg l pnp with aeration the residual pnp concentration in the bulk solution was monitored by sampling at regular intervals until pnp was completely degraded the pnp concentration was determined spectrophotometrically at Î»max of 401 nm using a uv vis spectrophotometer shimadzu uv 2600 japan 32 the experiments were conducted in duplicates and the mean values were reported 2 7 reusability of pva alginate as cryogels the reusability of pva alginate as cryogel beads was studied by repeatedly using the same batch of cryogel beads for successive pnp biodegradations after each cycle of degradation the beads were washed using distilled water and then transferred into the solution containing nutrients and pnp 100 mg l for subsequent biodegradation cycle during the biodegradation process the time course of residual pnp concentration was recorded optical density at regular time interval was also determined at Î»max of 600 nm to monitor the leakage of activated sludge the reusability experiment was terminated once disintegration or leakage of activated sludge was observed to investigate the effects of initial pnp concentration on the mechanical strength of pva alginate as cryogel beads and biodegradation rate the reusability study was repeated using higher pnp concentration 500 mg l 3 results and discussion 3 1 morphology of pva alginate and pva alginate as cryogel beads fig 1 a and b show the appearance of pva alginate and pva alginate as cryogel beads respectively the brownish color of pva alginate as cryogel bead indicates that the activated sludge was successfully entrapped in pva alginate cryogel the pva alginate as cryogel bead remained intact after 20 cycles of pnp biodegradation fig 1 c from the sem image of cross sectional surface of a pva alginate cryogel bead fig 1 d irregular sized pores are found unevenly distributed the porous structure of pva alginate is crucial in promoting the diffusion or transportation of substrate molecules from external environment into the inner part of beads or vice versa 6 after immobilization of activated sludge the clumps of biomass can be observed distributed or attached on the filaments that comprised the network fig 1 e 3 2 statistical analysis using anova the ccd design stands on empirical design in relating the relationship and interrelationship between the factors with responses via quadratic equation which follows second order polynomial response surface equation table 1 presents the experimental matrices based on ccd design with actual values of the independent variables and the respective two responses biodegradation rate and breakage upon eliminating those insignificant model terms that did not affect the model hierarchical the final regression models in terms of coded process variables were obtained and shown as below 2

are highlighted in tables 2 and 3 the aptness of these models was confirmed by the f and p values the models f values of 135 06 and 38 30 indicate the significance of the models for biodegradation rate and breakage percentage respectively the results showed that only 0 01 chance that an f value this large could occur due to noise a p value of 0 05 underscores the model significance in contrast a p values of greater than 0 10 typically implies the statistical inadequacy the lack of fits f test denotes the variation of the data scattering the fitted model a p value of 0 10 for lack of fit is desired to support the model with a negligible pure error furthermore r2 and adjusted r2 values are required to be close to 1 0 as these values advocate a high correlation between the observed and predicted values in this study for both models the results implied the significant correlation between the process variables and responses 33 in addition the predicted r2 values were in reasonable agreement with the adjusted r2 for the developed models therefore the total dissimilarity was merely 2 the models adequate precisions of greater than 4 0 58 78 and 15 01 for eqs 2 and 3 respectively denoting an adequate signal and the models can thus be used to navigate the design space adequate approximation to the real system by the selected model is important the normal probability plots of the studentized residuals and diagnostics can help to judge and validate the model satisfactoriness from fig 2 a it can be noticed that the data for the responses of biodegradation rate and bead breakage follows normal distribution also for both cases the real and predicted values were in good similarity as indicated by the close distribution of actual experimental data to the straight line of predicted values fig 2 b 3 3 effects of interactive variables on the responses 3 3 1 pnp biodegradation rate based on the developed models the comparative effects of all independent variables on pnp biodegradation rate are presented in the perturbation plots fig 3 from the figure the sharp curvature of alginate concentration c indicates its most significant effect on pnp biodegradation rate relatively gentle slope can be observed for the variables of cacl2 concentration d and freezing thawing cycle e similar phenomenon was observed by won et al 2005 studying the effects of alginate and cacl2 concentrations on the loading efficiency and immobilization yield it was reported that the effect of alginate concentration was greater compared to that of cacl2 concentration nonetheless in this study the increase of cacl2 concentration resulted in an increment in pnp biodegradation rate besides a slight drop of nearly plateau curve of bead size a could be noticed beyond the 0 coded unit implying a decrease of biodegradation rate at larger bead size this can be explained by the increase in diffusion limitation at increasing bead size and thus lower substrate removal rate 5 6 34 a slight increment of the pva concentration b curvature towards 1 0 coded unit was noted this trend could be plausibly explained by the structural changes of pva alginate as cryogel beads in becoming less porous at higher pva concentration and thus resulted in unfavorable effects to the substrate transfer and the bacterial growth 15 the fitted 3d response surface and their respective 2d contour plots fig 4 were constructed to investigate the optimum level of each variable and their interactions on pnp biodegradation rate the surface plots were constructed for pair wise combination with other factors set at their middle levels 0 coded as shown in previous perturbation plot fig 3 the biodegradation slowed down at increasing alginate concentration from anova analysis the interactions between alginate concentration and cacl2 concentration freeze thawing cycle or the bead size fig 4 had significant impact on pnp biodegradation rate other interactions among the variables are placed at lower significance level fig s1 as accentuated by the peak in fig 4 a the optimum pnp biodegradation rate could be attained using smaller bead at lower alginate concentration similar result was reported by toh et al 6 in which smaller pva alginate hydrogel beads of 3 mm exhibited the fastest rate of o cresol biodegradation compared to the bigger bead sizes of 4 5 and 6 mm this phenomenon was associated to the increased path length for the substrate movement to biomass for biodegradation due to the impenetrable part of polymer thus increasing bead size led to the greater mass transfer limitation leading to low biodegradation rate from fig 4 b the maximum degradation rate took place at cacl2 concentration between 2 5 and 3 5 at lower limit of alginate concentration the lack of ca2 ion as the crosslinker caused insufficient gelation however excessive cacl2 gave rise to low microbial activity due to high osmotic pressure of salt that resulted in less efficient diffusion of substrate into the beads 15 for the interaction between alginate concentration and number of freezing thawing cycle fig 4 c significant effect was imposed on biodegradation rate at high alginate concentration conversely little influence on biodegradation rate was observed at low limit of alginate concentration sem images for cross sectional surface of pva alginate cyrogel beads prepared using 1 and 2 alginate with 3 and 5 freezing thawing cycles are shown in fig 5 at low alginate concentration fig 5 a and b the porosity was not affected significantly by the number of freezing thawing cycle in comparison at higher alginate concentration more polymer rich region with lesser porosity was observed fig 5 c and d this resulted in an increase in the time required for the movement of substrate and thus a lower biodegradation rate at higher alginate concentration of 2 an existence of void around the boundaries of cryogel bead was noticed for 3 cycles of freezing thawing see arrow fig 5 c however no void was observed for 5 cycles of freezing thawing fig 5 d the effect of number of freezing thawing cycle was further investigated by comparing the extent of diffusion limitation the extent of diffusion limitation can be assessed in term of effectiveness factor Î· 6 as shown in eq 6 Î· is defined as the ratio of the biodegradation rate of immobilized biomass with diffusion limitation Î½i and biodegradation rate of suspended biomass without diffusion limitation Î½s 6 Î· Î½ i Î½ s the smaller the Î· value the greater the diffusion limitation by comparing the effectiveness factor for 2 cryogel beads the beads with higher number of freezing thawing cycle exhibited smaller Î· value indicating the higher diffusion resistance the ratio of 0 92 and 0 67 for 3 and 5 freeze thaw cycles respectively were obtained by comparing each biodegradation rate with the biodegradation rate for 1 cycle of freeze thaw process Î· 3 o r 5 Î· 1 the results indicated that higher number of freeze thaw cycle would exert higher diffusion limitation the difficulty of penetration of substrate into the interior of beads increased with increasing freezing thawing was attributed to the denser polymer network formed this observation is consistent with the study conducted by stauffer and peppast 35 they observed a reduction of 62 in diffusion coefficient at fifth freezing thawing cycle when compared with that at second cycle indicating the increase in diffusion limitation 3 3 2 response of beads breakage for the response of bead breakage as denoted by the sharp curvatures in the perturbation plot fig 6 all variables except number of freezing thawing cycle e were found to be responsible for the enhancement of mechanical stability of pva alginate as cryogel beads the significant effect of bead size a was indicated by sharp curvature in which minimum breakage was achieved at 0 coded point before or beyond that point reduction of mechanical stability was demonstrated this trend is plausibly explained by the density of the polymer network the slope of pva concentration b increased sharply with increasing concentration indicating the enhancement of cryogel bead strength with higher pva concentration at high pva concentration the crosslinking of pva occurred easily and gave rise to an increase in the number of crosslink junction consequently the polymer mesh became denser and hence the gel strength increased 36 37 similar curvature was observed for the variables of alginate concentration c and cacl2 concentration d dong et al 15 reported that the bead mechanical stability was affected by alginate concentration in which the higher the alginate concentration the greater the gel strength however beyond the optimum alginate concentration the beads were too hard and hence hindered the cell growth similarly crosslinker cacl2 possessed optimum operative concentration to achieve complete crosslinking in gel formation the comparatively plateau curvature for number of freeze thawing cycle e shown in this study suggested its low sensitivity on breakage this is in contrast with the results reported by holloway et al 38 in which increased strength of pva cryogels with increasing number of freeze thawing cycles was detected due to the formation of denser polymer network mesh by studying the interaction effects of independent variables on breakage fig 7 it was affirmed that the factor of alginate concentration showed significant impact in making stable cryogel beads minimum breakage could be attained at the optimal alginate concentration between 1 2 1 6 cross linking between alginate c and ca2 ions d led to gelation thus sufficient amount of alginate and ca2 ions were required to produce mechanically stable beads with minimum breakage in this study calcium chloride ranging from 2 0 3 0 was deduced as the optimal concentration the freezing thawing process contributes to the formation of physically crosslinked matrix consisting crystalline and amorphous regions the increase in freezing thawing cycle increases the mechanical properties 36 however in this study the enhancement of beads stability by increasing the freezing thawing cycle was only attained at lower range of alginate concentration fig 7 b the increasing number of freezing thawing cycle induced the extent of polymer association and the polymer mesh became denser as shown in the sem images fig 5 a and b the results is corroborated with the findings reported by chhatri et al 39 in which the crosslinking density and thus the gel strength could be improved by increasing the number of freezing thawing cycle it had also been reported that the hydrogels with higher crosslink density exhibited higher mechanical strength 37 nonetheless a reversed pattern was observed at higher alginate concentration where the breakage increased with increasing freezing thawing cycles similar observation was reported by millon et al 40 in which the mechanical strength of pva cryogel leveled off when all available polymers were tied up in the mesh after seven cycles 38 40 it was also proposed that when the polymer association brought by the freezing thawing process exceeded a certain limit further freezing thawing would led to over association and thus the decrease of gel strength 41 interaction effects of alginate concentration and pva concentration with bead size on bead breakage are depicted in fig 7 c and d respectively as indicated by the uniform elongated pattern in the 2 d contour plot the interaction effect between these variables on bead breakage was significant and two trends could be observed the breakage percentage increased with increasing bead sizes at low polymer concentration and this is associated with the density of the polymer network at low polymer concentration bigger bead size resulted in less dense polymer network and thus the expanded conformation in comparison the smaller beads were found to be easily broken at high polymer concentration as discussed earlier alginate concentration was an important factor in deciding the mechanical stability dong et al reported good bead stability for immobilized cells at 1 1 of alginate however beyond this optimum concentration it became too hard 15 at high polymer concentration the polymer was packed densely in small bead with low flexibility and thus brittle easily when the bead size increased reduction in breakage percentage was observed in this study the least percentage of bead breakage approaching 0 could be achieved using low alginate concentration 1 4 and small bead size 3 0 mm fig 7 c based on the results in fig 7 d minimum bead breakage could be obtained at pva concentration between 5 6 and bead size less than 3 5 mm other interactions of different variable combination were of less significance on breakage and are shown as supplementary results fig s2 3 4 process variables optimization and validation the optimization process was conducted to determine the optimal level of each variable for maximizing the responses using desirability function method in the software the desired goal for each variable was set independently within the range the response of pnp biodegradation was placed at maximum to attain the fastest biodegradation rate whereas the breakage was set at the minimum to achieve the greatest mechanical stability the software combined individual desirability into a single number in searches to maximizing the function based on the response goal the optimum conditions and the respective responses were established and a preferred solution was chosen considering the relative ease in the preparation of pva alginate as cryogel beads a biodegradation rate of 7 4 mg l h and 0 of breakage were predicted according to the model under optimized conditions bead size 3 659 mm pva concentration 8 0 wt alginate concentration 1 411 wt cacl2 concentration 3 012 wt and number of freezing thawing cycle 3 the desirability function value was found to be 0 723 for these predicted optimum conditions an additional experiment run was then conducted in duplicate according to the optimum condition to verify the validity and accuracy of the model the results obtained pnp biodegradation rate of 8 0 mg l h and breakage percentage of 10 agreed well with the predicted response value 3 5 reusability of pva alginate as cryogels the pva alginate as cryogel beads produced under optimized conditions was repeatedly used for pnp biodegradation process when dealing with low initial pnp concentration of 100 mg l the pva alginate as cryogel beads preserved a high degrading ability after 20 cycles without any leakage of biomass or disintegration this phenomenon is corroborated with the results reported by dong et al 15 they showed that the denitrifying capacity and activity of immobilized ammonia oxidizing bacteria in pva alginate gel was retained after 5 cycles although the pva alginate as cryogel beads did not break the beads became larger in size fig 1 a and softer as compared to the original beads there are two possible reasons to explain the physical appearance change of reused beads biomass growth or swelling effect the biomass growth could lead to saturation within the bead resulting in the expansion of the bead wall meanwhile the latter was related to the osmotic equilibrium and restoration of elastic pressure the substrate solution diffused into the beads and attempted to achieving osmotic balance while the polymer network provided a restoring elastic pressure and maintained the structure integrity however the elasticity was weakened by the strong osmotic pressure over the recycling time when initial pnp concentration was increased to 500 mg l the disintegration of beads was noticed earlier at the end of the fourth cycle the disintegration may be caused by the excessive growth of biomass under high supply of substrate this phenomenon was in coherent with the results reported by other researchers 5 6 in this study the reaction period for biodegradation of 500 mg l pnp was four times longer than that of 100 mg l thus this led to the deterioration of mechanical strength of the beads due to swelling effect as described above the corresponding pnp biodegradation rates at different initial pnp concentrations 100 and 500 mg l for each cycle are shown in table 4 interestingly remarkable increase in the biodegradation rate with increasing cycle of use was observed this increasing trend could be plausibly explained by the biomass growth within the beads after each cycle of use however at initial pnp concentration of 100 mg l the biodegradation rate reached a constant value after 10 cycles this could be due to the diffusion limitations of substrate molecules from the bulk phase into the beads 4 conclusion the ccd was exploited in this study to optimize the interactive factors namely bead size number of freezing thawing cycle pva alginate and cacl2 concentrations on pnp biodegradation rate and beads breakage the results clearly demonstrated that both derived models were satisfying for prediction as indicated by the statistical significance among the five variables alginate concentration had the most prominent influence on both dependent variables in addition the interactions of alginate concentration with cacl2 concentration number of freezing thawing cycle and bead size exhibited significant impact on both responses the optimized conditions for the immobilization process were bead size 3 659 mm pva concentration 8 0 wt alginate concentration 1 411 wt cacl2 concentration 3 012 wt and number of freezing thawing cycle 3 fast pnp biodegradation rate 8 0 mg l h and minimum beads breakage 10 were obtained experimentally and the results agreed with predicted values by rsm ccd the reusability of pva alginate as cryogel beads was dependent on the initial pnp concentration declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements this research was supported by

13729,polytitanium coagulants have been recently developed and have received wide attention due to both strong coagulation capability and sludge recycling to produce valuable by products titanium dioxide tio2 this study reports the performance of coagulation with emerging polytitanium salts polytitanium chloride ptc and polytitanium sulfate pts for the treatment of two common cyanobacteria microcystis aeruginosa ma and microcystis wesenbergii mw laden surface water which has been barely reported of particular concern is the coagulant dosage and solution ph dependence of polytitanium coagulation which are the main parameters influencing coagulation efficiency the influence of basicity b of ptc and pts on coagulation performance was simultaneously included results show the optimized b value of 1 5 with coagulant dosage of 30 mg l and initial solution ph between 7 9 for both ptc and pts coagulation wherein obvious advantage of ptc was observed over pts regardless of ma or mw laden surface water treatment the ptc coagulation could achieve almost complete removal of algae about 99 0 with synergic removal of organic matter with high efficiency both ptc and pts were more capable at alkaline solution ph conditions for turbidity and algae removal through sweep flocculation while satisfied removal of the humic acid representative organic matters was observed at acidic to neutral ph conditions by charge neutralization satisfied flocculation zones were determined according to synergic removal of algae turbidity and organic matters with most of the satisfied points distributed at solution ph 7 9 conditions this study will provide theoretical basis and facilitate wide application of the polytitanium coagulation for algae loaded surface water treatment keywords coagulation polytitanium salts basicity algae laden surface water flocculation zone 1 introduction removal of algae from water bodies have attracted wide attention due to the world wide eutrophication and their damage to ecological structure and function 1 3 microcystis aeruginosa ma and microcystis wesenbergii mw are two common bloom forming cyanobacterial species in shallow eutrophic lakes in many countries 4 6 ma produces microcystin 7 while mw is recently proved as toxigenic strains 8 coagulation have been regarded as one of the most simplified and economical strategies for intact removal of algae cells from water 9 11 the alternative titanium based coagulants i e ticl4 and ti so4 2 have been proposed for water purification due to their i at least comparable coagulation performance with the conventional al and fe based coagulants 12 15 ii improved flocs characteristics in most cases in terms of larger floc size with faster growth rate and better settleability 16 18 and iii sludge recycling to produce valuable photocatalyst tio2 19 21 solving the problem of sludge treatment and disposal shon et al 20 reported the production of 446 5 kg photocatalyst day from a medium size ca 25 000 m3 d wastewater treatment plant effective alternative application of titanium based coagulants instead of al and fe coagulants could achieve both water purification and the coagulated sludge recycling although ticl4 and ti so4 2 have excellent coagulation capability the coagulated effluent is at a low ph level ph of 3 0 4 5 thus the titanium based coagulants develops toward the polymerized ones such as polymerized titanium tetrachloride ptc 16 22 23 and polymerized titanium sulfate pts 24 25 therein the pre hydrolysis of titanium is completed before their application to test water and therefore the release of h is reduced with improved ph of the coagulated effluent moreover stronger coagulation capability of ptc and pts was observed than the non polymerized ones since polymerized titanium based coagulants mainly ptc and pts are recently developed as novel salts for water purification limited studies have reported their performance of coagulation for algae laden water treatment as with other polymeric coagulants basicity of ptc and pts solution poses inevitable influence on performance of coagulation due to the varied degrees of pre hydrolysis which is a basic research required to expand application of the polytitanium coagulation for algae laden wastewater treatment besides basicity of coagulant solution coagulant dosage and

water treatment 2 experimental materials and methods 2 1 algae cultivation and test water two species of algae microcystis aeruginosa ma fachb 905 and microcystis wesenbergii mw fachb 1112 from the institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of sciences were cultured and used for the preparation of the test water in this study both algae species were cultured in bg11 media in light incubator with 12 h light and 12 h dark per cycle growth of the species was monitored every other day by counting the numbers of algae cells using microscope olympus bx41 during their whole life cycle the algae suspension was utilized for the preparation of the test water when they reached late exponential phase of growth ca 107 cells ml for ma species and 106 cells ml for mw species preparation of the test

suspension to the filtrate with the final algae concentration of 106 cells ml for ma and 105 cells ml for mw laden surface water detailed characteristics of the ma laden and mw laden surface water are presented in table 1 2 2 coagulants two polymerized titanium based coagulants polytitanium tetrachloride ptc and polytitanium sulfate pts were utilized in this study preparation of ptc and pts have been reported in our previous studies 23 24 before the preparation of ptc the concentrated ticl4 99 5 aladdin was firstly diluted to 20 in ice water bath in brief the determined amount of concentrated naoh 200 g l was dropped into ticl4 20 and ti so4 2 24 kanto chemical co inc tokyo japan by trace titration method to obtain ptc and pts respectively with varied basicity values of 0 5 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 the ptc with varied b values of 0 5 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 are denoted as ptc0 5 ptc1 0 ptc1 5 ptc2 0 respectively while ptc without pre hydrolysis b 0 was denoted as ptc0 ticl4 same way of definition was suitable for pts 2 3 jar test standard jar tests were conducted using coagulation test stirrer my3000 6 f meiyu instruments co ltd determined amount of coagulant dosage was added to the test water under rapid mixing of 200 rpm followed by subsequent 1 min at same rate the 15 min of slow mixing at 40 rpm was applied to promote the growth of flocs and finally 15 min of settling for flocs sedimentation performance of coagulation was characterized in terms of the removal of turbidity 2100q turbidity meter hach uv254 tu1810pc uv vis spectrophotometer and dissolved organic carbon doc toc vcph analyzer shimadzu japan mechanisms of coagulation was investigated in terms of the change of floc zeta potential nano zs90 malvern effluent ph was also measured phs 3c lei ci all the measurements were conducted in triplicate and the results shown in this study were the average values to evaluate the ph dependent flocculation zones ph of the test water was adjusted using naoh 0 1 m and hcl 0 1

application three regions were defined i satisfied flocculation zone residual turbidity 3 0 ntu algae removal 90 uv254 removal 50 ii unsatisfied flocculation zone 3 0 ntu residual turbidity 10 0 ntu

algae removal efficiency ha removal efficiency and combination of the three 3 results and discussion 3 1 dosage dependence of ptc and pts coagulation for ma and mw laden surface water this section analyzed and compared the variation of ptc and pts coagulation performance vs coagulant dose for both ma and mw laden surface water coagulation performance was investigated in terms of residual turbidity algae removal uv254 removal and doc removal zeta potential of the coagulated flocs was studied to explore the coagulation mechanisms influence of basicity b range of 0 2 0 of ptc and pts on coagulation efficiency and effluent ph was included moreover optimized coagulation performances at varied b values of pts and ptc are summarized 3 1 1 ptc coagulation for ma and mw laden surface water change of coagulation efficiency residual turbidity algae removal uv254 removal and doc removal with ptc dosage shows similar trend for both ma and mw laden surface water treatment fig 1 residual turbidity slightly decreased with increasing ptc dosage from 5 to 15 mg l with the lowest values being observed at around 15 35 mg l followed by the subsequent increase with further increase of ptc dosage improvement in b value facilitated the reduction of the residual turbidity especially at high ptc dosages 35 mg l fig 1 a and b a removal of the algae uv254 and doc vs ptc dosage showed the parabolic like trend regardless of ma or mw laden surface water treatment the pollutants in test water were negatively charged with zeta potential values of around 24 0 and 28 0 mv respectively for ma and mw laden surface water table 1 wen ptc coagulant was added into the test water it hydrolyzed to the positively charged species like ti x o y oh z cl n h2o m 4x 2 y z n 23 followde by quick reaction with the pollutants in test water hydrolyzation of ptc with low dosages produced less positive charged species and resulted in the coagulated flocs with high absolute value of zeta potential whilst under high ptc dosage conditions residual positive charges from the hydrolyzed species of ptc led to the coagulated flocs with positive charges thus change of the absolute values of zeta potential vs ptc dosage presented parabolic like trend as that of the removal of algae uv254 and doc specifically ptc was capable for removing ma species 80 within wide dosage range from approximately 20 50 mg l whilst mw species removal was more dependent on b value of ptc with the results showing the reduced algae removal at b 2 0 both uv254 and doc removal by up to 10 could be enhanced by increasing b value of ptc to 1 5 worth noting was the deterioration of organic matter removal with further increase of b value to 2 0 change of zeta potential of the particles before and after coagulation process is generally utilized to indicate the coagulation mechanisms zeta potential is defined as the potential difference between the dispersion medium and the stationary layer of fluid attached to the particle the ptc coagulant was supposed to hydrolyze to ti x o y oh z cl n h2o m 4x 2 y z n 23 right after its addition to test water reactions between the negatively charged pollutants and positively charged hydrolysates happened resulting in the coagulated flocs with varied zeta potentials with increasing ptc dosage the hydrolysates were speculated to have more positive charges with the positive flocs being produced charge neutralization was the main coagulation mechanism of ptc coagulation as proved by the increase of zeta potential of the coagulated flocs from negative values to positive ones fig 1 a and b e the ptc coagulants with varied b values were the pre polymerization of titanium tetrachloride ticl4 which prompted the hydrolysis of ticl4 before its application to the test water 23 the b value of ptc was a significant factor influencing zeta potential of the coagulated flocs with the results presenting the zeta potential values of flocs generally followed b 0 b 1 0 b 1 5 b 2 0 at same dosage the results indicated that charge neutralization capability of the hydrolyzed titanium species became weak with increasing b values of ptc simultaneously due to the pre hydrolyzation of the titanium species before its addition into test water the subsequent hydrolyzation of the titanium species in test water required less oh 1 and thus the effluent ph increased with increasing ph values fig 1 a and b f 3 1 2 pts coagulation for ma and mw laden surface water performances of pts coagulation for the treatment of ma and mw laden surface water are presented in fig 2 in general coagulation performance vs pts dosage presented similar trend with that in ptc case likewise b value of pts played important role in coagulation procedure with the results suggested that pts with appropriate basicity could improve both organic matter removal and effluent solution ph moreover coagulation capability of pts varied from ptc for ma and mw laden surface waste treatment due to the probable difference of coagulation mechanisms specifically in case of ma laden surface water treatment pts showed comparable coagulation ability as ptc for algae separation reach 99 0 from wastewater but its capability for doc removal was around 20 weaker than ptc fig 1a and fig 2 a ptc coagulation b 1 5 35 mg l could achieve 80 0 of doc removal while the highest removal of doc was only about 60 0 by pts different from ma laden surface water pts was more capable for mw laden water treatment especially for doc removal fig 2b in comparison the highest doc removal by pts coagulation of ma laden surface water was 60 around while that for mw laden surfacw water doc removal could reach 80 pts b 1 5 25 mg l zeta potential of the flocs formed by pts coagulation increased with increasing pts dosage with the final zero mv around regardless of ma or mw laden surface water treatment fig 2 a and b e the increase of the b value of pts promoted the pre hydrolysis of the titanium species before their addition to test water specifically zeta potentials of the coagulated flocs by pts1 0 pts1 5 and pts2 0 were still negative even under high pts dosage conditions in case of mw laden water treatment this indicated that the resultant pre hydrolzyed titanium species were more capable for sweep flocculation as evidenced by the lower zeta potentials of the flocs as compared with those formed by pts0 this isn t the case for ma laden water treatment it is certain that characteristics of the pollutants in test water influence the coagulation mechanisms the pts coagulant hydrolyzed to the tiaob oh c hso4 x so4 y h2o z 4a 2b c x 2y 24 followed by their reaction with the pollutants in test water the particulates in ma laden and mw laden surface water had different values of zeta potential of 23 7 1 1 and 27 9 2 0 mv respectively table 1 besides size of the mw cell is 9 10 Î¼m in diameter while that of ma cell is 3 4 Î¼m in the present study the varied sizes and values of zeta potential of ma and mw species were speculated to be the dominant reasons to affect the coagulation mechanisms in case of the ma laden surface water treatment besides b values of pts pts dosage influenced the coagualtion capability of the pre hydrolyzed titnaium species at pts 25 0 mg l pts2 0 showed stronger charge neutralization capability than pts0 as demonstrated by the higher zeta potential of the flocs whilst at pts 25 mg l the lowest values of zeta potential in pts2 0 case suggested its weakest ability of charge neutralization 3 1 3 optimized coagulation performances at varied b values of pts and ptc the ph of the raw ma and mw laden surface water in this study was around 8 5 table 1 which is the common value for most of the water bodies real water and wastewater treatment plants tend to keep the initial ph of test water before its treatment the same for algae laden surface water purification for this purpose the optimized coagulant dosages and coagulation performances in initial solution ph conditions of ptc and pts are summarized in table 2 both ptc and pts showed strong capability for the removal of both ma and mw species within wide range of b values from b of 0 2 0 with the algae removal rate of higher than 90 0 the results correspond well with previous report that titanium based coagulants had strong coagulation capability for algae removal 27 residual turbidity varied in the range of 1 5 2 0 ntu within all the b values investigated difference between ptc and pts coagulation mainly depended on the removal of organic matters in real water and wastewater treatment we prefer to select the optimum b value considering both economic and coagulation efficiencies accordingly the optimum b value was selected at 1 5 therein in case of ma laden surface water ptc could achieve ca 60 0 removal of uv254 with simultaneous doc removal of up to 76 0 while the respective removal of uv254 and doc by pts was about 6 0 and 18 0 lower than those by ptc ptc coagulation was also superior to pts for mw laden surface water purification with removal of uv254 and doc reached 70 0 and 86 0 respectively in contrast approximately 10 0 lower of organic matter removal was seen in pts case in summary under the initial solution ph condition ph of around 8 5 polymerized titanium coagulants presented better coagulation performance than the non polymerized ones the enhanced coagulation capability of polymerized coagulants was proved by previous reports 23 28 the b value of 1 5 was selected as the optimized one for both ptc and pts for ma and mw laden surface water treatment worth noting is that although ptc1 5 and pts1 5 were superior to the non polymerized ones in terms of coagulation performance the optimal dosage of ptc1 5 and pts1 5 is 5 mg l higher than that of ptc0 and pts0 table 2 shows that ptc had advantage around 10 higher removal of organic matter over pts for both ma and mw treatment coagulation capability of the hydrolysates of the coagulant was the key to influence the coagulation efficiency we have detected kinds of hydrolysates for effective coagulation 23 24 but the dominant ones were still unclear higher amounts of the dominant hydrolysates for coagulation were the probable reason for the superiority of ptc to pts moreover compared with the mw surface water ptc was more capable for the ma laden surface water treatment as evidenced by the enhanced uv254 and doc removal up to respect 70 0 and 86 0 around in comparison with the conventional polyaluminum chloride pac although it was widely used for algae laden surface water treatment 29 30 the pac was not as capable as ptc and pts for simultaneous removal of natural organic matter and algae polytitanium coagulants will be the promising environmental friendly reagents due to both high efficient water purification and the sludge recovery and reuse 3 2 solution ph dependence of ptc and pts coagulation for ma and mw laden surface water since solution ph is a key factor influencing hydrolysis of the coagulants adjustment of the ph of the test water is a common used strategy to enhance the coagulation performance coagulant dosage of 30 0 mg l and b value of 1 5 were chosen for both ptc and pts to investigate their dependence of coagulation on solution ph for ma and mw laden water treatment fig 3 the ph values of 5 7 9 and 11 were chosen for comparison at ph 5 regardless of ma or mw laden surface water increase of pts dosage led to sharp increase of residual turbidity which was accompanied by apparent deterioration of both algae and uv254 removal only pts dosage of 5 0 mg l was acceptable for practical engineering application with residual turbidity algae removal uv254 removal of around 3 0 ntu 50 0 90 0 respectively significant advantage of ptc over pts was observed in terms of the removal of turbidity algae and organic matter worth noting was the strong coagulation capability of ptc for ma species removal removal efficiency between 82 0 and 92 0 within wide range of ptc dosage from 5 to 60 mg l the removal of uv254 by ptc could reach about 60 0 at low dosage range of 5 0 15 0 mg l while further increase of the ptc dosage led to continuous drop of organic matter removal in contrast with ph of 5 at solution ph of 11 pts was highly efficient for the removal of turbidity and ma species in wide range of dosage range 5 60 mg l but the removal of uv254 was lower than 40 fig 3d therein residual turbidity varied at about 1 8 0 2 ntu and ma removal efficiency was approximately 94 0 4 0 results indicated that at ph 11 the hydrolyzed titanium species from pts were mainly responsible for algae removal not for organic matter removal similarly coagulation capability of pts was also much stronger at ph 11 than ph 5 in case of mw laden surface water treatment the 96 0 removal of mw species was accompanied by 60 0 removal of uv254 within pts dosage of 50 0 60 0 mg l at low pts dosage of 5 0 30 0 mg l the hydrolyzed titanium species were speculated to first react with mw species not the uv254 representative organics as evidenced by the high mw removal of 70 0 90 0 and the uv254 removal of lower than 28 0 same conclusions could be obtained in ptc case and ptc showed superior coagulation performance for ma laden surface water treatment than mw laden surface water when ptc and pts were added into test water they first underwent hydrolytic process to form ti x o y oh z cl n h2o m 4x 2 y z n 23 and ti a o b oh c hso4 x so4 y h2o z 4 a 2 b c x 2 y 24 respectively followed by their reaction with pollutants solution ph of the test water directly affected the charges of the hydrolyzed products which were the key to influence the coagulation capability of coagulants at ph 11 abundant hydroxyl facilitated the hydrolysis of ptc and pts resulting in the hydrolyzed specie with less positive charges sometimes ti oh 4 precipitates they were more likely to paly the role of adsorption and bridging during coagulation process for the removal of large algae species while the organic matter in the test water were tended to be flocculated by charge neutralization this might be used to explain the priority of ptc and pts for algae removal at solution ph 11 in contrast at solution ph of 7 and 9 ptc and pts were speculated to produce various poly nuclear hydroxyl polymers with more positive charges when they were added in test water the hydrolyzed products were supposed to be capable for the removal of pollutants through charge neutralization adsorption and bridging and sweep flocculation this might be the reason for simultaneous removal of both algae and organic matter at solution ph of 7 and 9 fig 3b and c besides solution ph coagulation performance of ptc and pts largely depended on dosage of the coagulants compared with the case of ph 11 synergic removal of algae species and organic matters could be achieved in lower dosage conditions at solution ph of 7 and 9 especially in case of pts wherein simultaneous removal of algae 95 0 and organic matter 60 0 could be achieved at 30 0 mg l around while in ph 11 50 0 mg l of pts was required worth noting was that at solution ph 7 ptc showed significant advantage over pts for ma laden surface water treatment with 95 0 99 0 of algae removal in wide range of dosage range from 25 0 to 60 0 mg l moreover the removal of organic matter by ptc could reach 80 0 about 20 0 higher than the cases of pts coagulation however at solution ph 9 comparable performance could be achieved by pts coagulation at lower dosage than ptc thus pts coagulant was the preferred one for both ma and mw laden surface water in real engineering applications 3 3 optimized coagulation conditions of ptc and pts solution ph influence on coagulation performance of ptc and pts at varied b values were studied in this study with the results being presented in supporting information s1 and s2 according to both coagulant dosage and solution ph dependence of coagulation with ptc and pts the optimized conditions and performances of coagulation for both ma and mw laden surface water purification are presented in table 3 the optimized b value of ptc and pts was 1 5 and the optimized dosage was 30 0 mg l the optimized solution ph varied from 7 9 under the optimized coagulation conditions obvious advantage of ptc was observed over pts in terms of turbidity algae and organic matter removal regardless of ma or mw laden surface water treatment in case of ptc coagulation residual turbidity was at around 1 0 ntu which was the widely accepted value for water purification standards almost complete removal of algae about 99 0 could be achieved by ptc coagulation with simultaneous removal of organic matter with high efficiency up to 60 0 of uv254 and 80 0 of doc removal in contrast residual turbidity after pts coagulation was around 2 0 ntu and what s worse was the 20 30 lower of doc removal than ptc case moreover ph of the effluent after pts coagulation was about 3 5 which was much lower than the value of 5 0 around in ptc case low effluent ph needed to be adjusted to near neutral before going to the next treatment unit or direct emission a big disadvantage of utilizing titanium based coagulants for water purification was the low effluent ph as previous studies reported 14 31 32 thus pre hydrolyzed titanium coagulants were preferred than the non prehydrolyzed ones 33 researchers also tried to use flocculant aid such as polyacrylamide pam 34 compound bioflocculant cbf 35 and polydimethyldiallyl ammonium chloride pdmdaac 36 etc to enhance the titanium coagulation at low dosages of titanium coagulants even though these strategies were proved effective to improve the effluent ph we suggest to employ the titanium coagulants those could produce the effluent with the effluent ph near to neutral analysis of the zeta potential of the coagulated flocs is a common used method to explore the coagulation mechanisms 37 charge neutralization and sweep flocculation are the widely used mechanisms of coagulation 38 zeta potential values of the ptc coagulated flocs were about 6 4 and 7 1 mv for ma and mw laden surface water respectively whilst in case of pts coagulation much higher values of zeta potential were observed about 0 4 and 1 9 mv respectively in cases of ma and mw laden surface water the foulants in raw ma and mw laden surface water had zeta potential values of 23 7 1 1 and 27 9 2 0 mv respectively change of zeta potential of the foulants was attributed to the reaction between coagulants and the foulants increase of the zeta potential values indicated that charge neutralization occurred during both ptc and pts coagulation procedure the higher values of zeta potential in pts case indicated that the hydrolyzed titanium species during pts coagulation had stronger capability of charge neutralization whilst in ptc case although ptc showed higher coagulation performance than pts the coagulated flocs had much lower values of zeta potential which indicated that besides charge neutralization sweep flocculation played key role during ptc coagulation process although the hydrolyzed species from pts had stronger charge neutralization capability when it was added into test water the coagulation efficiency was lower than ptc case this indicated that the purification of ma and mw laden surface water largely depended on sweep flocculation not only charge neutralization 3 4 2d flocculation zone of ptc and pts the optimized b value of 1 5 was selected for both ptc and pts to explore their 2d flocculation zone according to their combined dependence on coagulant dosage and solution ph fig 4 three kinds of symbols represents i the satisfied flocculation point residual turbidity 3 0 ntu algae removal 90 uv254 removal 50 ii unsatisfied flocculation point 3 0 ntu residual turbidity 10 0 ntu 80 algae removal 90 and 40 uv254 removal 50 and iii invisible flocculation point cloudy water respectively therein the satisfied points were circled as the satisfied flocculation zones the flocculation zones of ptc and pts coagulation were respectively defined according to residual turbidity algae removal efficiency ha removal efficiency and combination of the three fig 4d both ptc and pts showed broad zones of satisfied flocculation in terms of turbidity removal especially from neutral to alkaline ph fig 4a although the zones of satisfied flocculation narrowed down according to algae removal algae removal up to 90 0 could still be observed at ph 11 fig 4b different from fig 4a and b the satisfied uv254 removal 50 0 were mostly observed at acidic to neutral ph conditions fig 4c results indicated that at alkaline solution ph conditions especially ph 11 the hydrolyzed products from both ptc and pts were more capable for turbidity and algae removal rather than the removal of ha representative organic matters according to fig s1 s4 zeta potential of the coagulated flocs showed gradual decrease with increasing solution ph zeta potentials of the coagulated flocs at solution ph 11 varied from 15 0 to 25 0 mv this indicated that sweep flocculation was the primary coagulation mechanism which was responsible for the removal of turbidity and algae whilst at solution ph 5 9 zeta potentials of the coagulated flocs were much higher than those at solution ph 11 satisfied removal of uv254 50 0 at acidic to neutral ph conditions demonstrated that charge neutralization play important role for the removal of ha representative organic matters especially at solution ph 5 wherein zeta potential of the flocs were above 0 mv in all cases for both ma and mw laden surface water treatment synergic removal of algae turbidity and organic matters were expected thus the satisfied zones of flocculation with ptc and pts were selected according to simultaneous turbidity algae and ha removal fig 4d most of the satisfied points distributed at solution ph 7 9 conditions this corresponded well with the optimized solution ph observed in table 3 the recently developed titanium based coagulants receive wide attention mainly due to the recovery of the titanium coagulated sludge to produce functional nanoparticles tio2 39 40 worth noting is that the titanium tetrachloride was proved to show strong coagulation capability for simultaneous removal of natural organic matter and algae cells 27 and the algae rich titanium containing sludge could be recovered to produce functional tio2 which showed enhanced photocatalytic degradation of the phenolic like pollutants 39 the polytitanium coagulants both ptc and pts were superior to pac in terms of i high efficient and simultaneous removal of organic matter and algae from algae laden surface water and ii recovery of functional nanoparticles from titanium coagulated sludge determination of the satisfied 2d flocculation zones of titanium based coagulants will provide theoretical basis and facilitate their wide application for water treatment additionally in this study the concentration of algae cells in ma and mw laden surface water reached 106 cells ml and 105 cells ml respectively which was high enough to simulate the algae concentration during high algae laden period in real conditions thus both ptc and pts were speculated to be high efficient coagulants for simultaneous removal of natural organic matter and algae species in actual algae laden surface water treatment 4 conclusions this study utilized the recently developed polytitanium coagulants polytitanium chloride ptc and polytitanium sulfate pts for coagulation treatment of both microcystis aeruginosa ma and microcystis wesenbergii mw laden surface water both coagulation performance and coagulation mechanism of ptc and pts were highly dependent on coagulant dosage and solution ph basicity of the coagulants that was the varied degrees of pre hydrolysis was another key parameter under investigation pre hydrolysis of titanium coagulants could not only enhance the coagulation performance but also improve the effluent ph the basicity of 1 5 was optimized for both ptc and pts and the optimized dosage of 30 mg l and initial solution ph of 7 9 were determined according to synergic purification of turbidity algae and organic matters regardless of ma or mw laden surface water the ptc was found to be superior to pts in terms of high efficient removal of algae ca 99 9 and organic matters respective uv254 and doc removal of about 60 0 and 80 0 whilst 20 30 lower of doc removal was observed in pts case under the optimized conditions ptc coagulation was completed mainly by sweep flocculation while charge neutralization was the predominant mechanism for pts coagulation superior coagulation performance of ptc to pts indicated that the purification of ma and mw laden surface water largely depended on sweep flocculation not only charge neutralization satisfied removal of the ha like organics was observed at acidic to neutral ph conditions while the removal of turbidity and algae was more complete at alkaline solution ph conditions satisfied zones of coagulation for both ptc and pts were determined with their distribution at solution ph 7 9 conditions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

13729,polytitanium coagulants have been recently developed and have received wide attention due to both strong coagulation capability and sludge recycling to produce valuable by products titanium dioxide tio2 this study reports the performance of coagulation with emerging polytitanium salts polytitanium chloride ptc and polytitanium sulfate pts for the treatment of two common cyanobacteria microcystis aeruginosa ma and microcystis wesenbergii mw laden surface water which has been barely reported of particular concern is the coagulant dosage and solution ph dependence of polytitanium coagulation which are the main parameters influencing coagulation efficiency the influence of basicity b of ptc and pts on coagulation performance was simultaneously included results show the optimized b value of 1 5 with coagulant dosage of 30 mg l and initial solution ph between 7 9 for both ptc and pts coagulation wherein obvious advantage of ptc was observed over pts regardless of ma or mw laden surface water treatment the ptc coagulation could achieve almost complete removal of algae about 99 0 with synergic removal of organic matter with high efficiency both ptc and pts were more capable at alkaline solution ph conditions for turbidity and algae removal through sweep flocculation while satisfied removal of the humic acid representative organic matters was observed at acidic to neutral ph conditions by charge neutralization satisfied flocculation zones were determined according to synergic removal of algae turbidity and organic matters with most of the satisfied points distributed at solution ph 7 9 conditions this study will provide theoretical basis and facilitate wide application of the polytitanium coagulation for algae loaded surface water treatment keywords coagulation polytitanium salts basicity algae laden surface water flocculation zone 1 introduction removal of algae from water bodies have attracted wide attention due to the world wide eutrophication and their damage to ecological structure and function 1 3 microcystis aeruginosa ma and microcystis wesenbergii mw are two common bloom forming cyanobacterial species in shallow eutrophic lakes in many countries 4 6 ma produces microcystin 7 while mw is recently proved as toxigenic strains 8 coagulation have been regarded as one of the most simplified and economical strategies for intact removal of algae cells from water 9 11 the alternative titanium based coagulants i e ticl4 and ti so4 2 have been proposed for water purification due to their i at least comparable coagulation performance with the conventional al and fe based coagulants 12 15 ii improved flocs characteristics in most cases in terms of larger floc size with faster growth rate and better settleability 16 18 and iii sludge recycling to produce valuable photocatalyst tio2 19 21 solving the problem of sludge treatment and disposal shon et al 20 reported the production of 446 5 kg photocatalyst day from a medium size ca 25 000 m3 d wastewater treatment plant effective alternative application of titanium based coagulants instead of al and fe coagulants could achieve both water purification and the coagulated sludge recycling although ticl4 and ti so4 2 have excellent coagulation capability the coagulated effluent is at a low ph level ph of 3 0 4 5 thus the titanium based coagulants develops toward the polymerized ones such as polymerized titanium tetrachloride ptc 16 22 23 and polymerized titanium sulfate pts 24 25 therein the pre hydrolysis of titanium is completed before their application to test water and therefore the release of h is reduced with improved ph of the coagulated effluent moreover stronger coagulation capability of ptc and pts was observed than the non polymerized ones since polymerized titanium based coagulants mainly ptc and pts are recently developed as novel salts for water purification limited studies have reported their performance of coagulation for algae laden water treatment as with other polymeric coagulants basicity of ptc and pts solution poses inevitable influence on performance of coagulation due to the varied degrees of pre hydrolysis which is a basic research required to expand application of the polytitanium coagulation for algae laden wastewater treatment besides basicity of coagulant solution coagulant dosage and ph of the test water are main factors influencing coagulation behavior titanium coagulants are supposed to hydrolyze to varied species of hydroxyl ploymers i e tix oh y 4x y ti oh 4 tix oh y y 4x right after its addition to test water followed by their reaction with foulants 23 26 ph of test water directly influences the formation of hydrolyzates with varied charges of positive negative ph

microcystis wesenbergii mw laden surface water series of jar tests were conducted to investigate both the dosage and ph dependence of ptc and pts for algae laden water purification effective flocculation zones were determined in consideration of coinstantaneous removal of algae species turbidity and organic matters dependence of coagulation mechanisms on coagulation dosage and solution ph

presented in table 1 2 2 coagulants two polymerized titanium based coagulants polytitanium tetrachloride ptc and polytitanium sulfate pts were utilized in this study preparation of ptc and pts have been reported in our previous studies 23 24 before the preparation of ptc the concentrated ticl4 99 5 aladdin was firstly diluted to 20 in ice water bath in brief the determined amount of concentrated naoh 200 g l was dropped into ticl4 20 and ti so4 2 24 kanto chemical co inc tokyo japan by trace titration method to obtain ptc and pts respectively with varied basicity values of 0 5 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 the ptc with varied b values of 0 5 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 are denoted as ptc0 5 ptc1 0 ptc1 5 ptc2 0 respectively while ptc without pre hydrolysis b 0 was denoted as ptc0 ticl4 same way of definition was suitable for pts 2 3 jar test standard jar tests were conducted using coagulation test stirrer my3000 6 f meiyu instruments co ltd determined amount of coagulant dosage was added to the test water under rapid mixing of 200 rpm followed by subsequent 1 min at same rate the 15 min of slow mixing at 40 rpm was applied to promote the growth of flocs and finally 15 min of settling for flocs sedimentation performance of coagulation was characterized in terms of the removal of turbidity 2100q turbidity meter hach uv254 tu1810pc uv vis spectrophotometer and dissolved organic carbon doc toc vcph analyzer shimadzu japan mechanisms of coagulation was investigated in terms of the change of floc zeta potential nano zs90 malvern effluent ph was also measured phs 3c lei ci all the measurements were conducted in triplicate and the results shown in this study were the average values to evaluate the ph dependent flocculation zones ph of the test water was adjusted using naoh 0 1 m and hcl 0 1

algae removal efficiency ha removal efficiency and combination of the three 3 results and discussion 3 1 dosage dependence of ptc and pts coagulation for ma and mw laden surface water this section analyzed and compared the variation of ptc and pts coagulation performance vs coagulant dose for both ma and mw laden surface water coagulation performance was investigated in terms of residual turbidity algae removal uv254 removal and doc removal zeta potential of the coagulated flocs was studied to explore the coagulation mechanisms influence of basicity b range of 0 2 0 of ptc and pts on coagulation efficiency and effluent ph was included moreover optimized coagulation performances at varied b values of pts and ptc are summarized 3 1 1 ptc coagulation for ma and mw laden surface water change of coagulation efficiency residual turbidity algae removal uv254 removal and doc removal with ptc dosage shows similar trend for both ma and mw laden surface water treatment fig 1 residual turbidity slightly decreased with increasing ptc dosage from 5 to 15 mg l with the lowest values being observed at around 15 35 mg l followed by the subsequent increase with further increase of ptc dosage improvement in b value facilitated the reduction of the residual turbidity especially at high ptc dosages 35 mg l fig 1 a and b a removal of the algae uv254 and doc vs ptc dosage showed the parabolic like trend regardless of ma or mw laden surface water treatment the pollutants in test water were negatively charged with zeta potential values of around 24 0 and 28 0 mv respectively for ma and mw laden surface water table 1 wen ptc coagulant was added into the test water it hydrolyzed to the positively charged species like ti x o y oh z cl n h2o m 4x 2 y z n 23 followde by quick reaction with the pollutants in test water hydrolyzation of ptc with low dosages produced less positive charged species and resulted in the coagulated flocs with high absolute value of zeta potential whilst under high ptc dosage conditions residual positive charges from the hydrolyzed species of ptc led to the coagulated flocs with positive charges thus change of the absolute values of zeta potential vs ptc dosage presented parabolic like trend as that of the removal of algae uv254 and doc specifically ptc was capable for removing ma species 80 within wide dosage range from approximately 20 50 mg l whilst mw species removal was more dependent on b value of ptc with the results showing the reduced algae removal at b 2 0 both uv254 and doc removal by up to 10 could be enhanced by increasing b value of ptc to 1 5 worth noting was the deterioration of organic matter removal with further increase of b value to 2 0 change of zeta potential of the particles before and after coagulation process is generally utilized to indicate the coagulation mechanisms zeta potential is defined as the potential difference between the dispersion medium and the stationary layer of fluid attached to the particle the ptc coagulant was supposed to hydrolyze to ti x o y oh z cl n h2o m 4x 2 y z n 23 right after its addition to test water reactions between the negatively charged pollutants and positively charged hydrolysates happened resulting in the coagulated flocs with varied zeta potentials with increasing ptc dosage the hydrolysates were speculated to have more positive charges with the positive flocs being produced charge neutralization was the main coagulation mechanism of ptc coagulation as proved by the increase of zeta potential of the coagulated flocs from negative values to positive ones fig 1 a and b e the ptc coagulants with varied b values were the pre polymerization of titanium tetrachloride ticl4 which prompted the hydrolysis of ticl4 before its application to the test water 23 the b value of ptc was a significant factor influencing zeta potential of the coagulated flocs with the results presenting the zeta potential values of flocs generally followed b 0 b 1 0 b 1 5 b 2 0 at same dosage the results indicated that charge neutralization capability of the hydrolyzed titanium species became weak with increasing b values of ptc simultaneously due to the pre hydrolyzation of the titanium species before its addition into test water the subsequent hydrolyzation of the titanium species in test water required less oh 1 and thus the effluent ph increased with increasing ph values fig 1 a and b f 3 1 2 pts coagulation for ma and mw laden surface water performances of pts coagulation for the treatment of ma and mw laden surface water are presented in fig 2 in general coagulation performance vs pts dosage presented similar trend with that in ptc case likewise b value of pts played important role in coagulation procedure with the results suggested that pts with appropriate basicity could improve both organic matter removal and effluent solution ph moreover coagulation capability of pts varied from ptc for ma and mw laden surface waste treatment due to the probable difference of coagulation mechanisms specifically in case of ma laden surface water treatment pts showed comparable coagulation ability as ptc for algae separation reach 99 0 from wastewater but its capability for doc removal was around 20 weaker than ptc fig 1a and fig 2 a ptc coagulation b 1 5 35 mg l could achieve 80 0 of doc removal while the highest removal of doc was only about 60 0 by pts different from ma laden surface water pts was more capable for mw laden water treatment especially for doc removal fig 2b in comparison the highest doc removal by pts coagulation of ma laden surface water was 60 around while that for mw laden surfacw water doc removal could reach 80 pts b 1 5 25 mg l zeta potential of the flocs formed by pts coagulation increased with increasing pts dosage with the final zero mv around regardless of ma or mw laden surface water treatment fig 2 a and b e the increase of the b value of pts promoted the pre hydrolysis of the titanium species before their addition to test water specifically zeta potentials of the coagulated flocs by pts1 0 pts1 5 and pts2 0 were still negative even under high pts dosage conditions in case of mw laden water treatment this indicated that the resultant pre hydrolzyed titanium species were more capable for sweep flocculation as evidenced by the lower zeta potentials of the flocs as compared with those formed by pts0 this isn t the case for ma laden water treatment it is certain that characteristics of the pollutants in test water influence the coagulation mechanisms the pts coagulant hydrolyzed to the tiaob oh c hso4 x so4 y h2o z 4a 2b c x 2y 24 followed by their reaction with the pollutants in test water the particulates in ma laden and mw laden surface water had different values of zeta potential of 23 7 1 1 and 27 9 2 0 mv respectively table 1 besides size of the mw cell is 9 10 Î¼m in diameter while that of ma cell is 3 4 Î¼m in the present study the varied sizes and values of zeta potential of ma and mw species were speculated to be the dominant reasons to affect the coagulation mechanisms in case of the ma laden surface water treatment besides b values of pts pts dosage influenced the coagualtion capability of the pre hydrolyzed titnaium species at pts 25 0 mg l pts2 0 showed stronger charge neutralization capability than pts0 as demonstrated by the higher zeta potential of the flocs whilst at pts 25 mg l the lowest values of zeta potential in pts2 0 case suggested its weakest ability of charge neutralization 3 1 3 optimized coagulation performances at varied b values of pts and ptc the ph of the raw ma and mw laden surface water in this study was around 8 5 table 1 which is the common value for most of the water bodies real water and wastewater treatment plants tend to keep the initial ph of test water before its treatment the same for algae laden surface water purification for this purpose the optimized coagulant dosages and coagulation performances in initial solution ph conditions of ptc and pts are summarized in table 2 both ptc and pts showed strong capability for the removal of both ma and mw species within wide range of b values from b of 0 2 0 with the algae removal rate of higher than 90 0 the results correspond well with previous report that titanium based coagulants had strong coagulation capability for algae removal 27 residual turbidity varied in the range of 1 5 2 0 ntu within all the b values investigated difference between ptc and pts coagulation mainly depended on the removal of organic matters in real water and wastewater treatment we prefer to select the optimum b value considering both economic and coagulation efficiencies accordingly the optimum b value was selected at 1 5 therein in case of ma laden surface water ptc could achieve ca 60 0 removal of uv254 with simultaneous doc removal of up to 76 0 while the respective removal of uv254 and doc by pts was about 6 0 and 18 0 lower than those by ptc ptc coagulation was also superior to pts for mw laden surface water purification with removal of uv254 and doc reached 70 0 and 86 0 respectively in contrast approximately 10 0 lower of organic matter removal was seen in pts case in summary under the initial solution ph condition ph of around 8 5 polymerized titanium coagulants presented better coagulation performance than the non polymerized ones the enhanced coagulation capability of polymerized coagulants was proved by previous reports 23 28 the b value of 1 5 was selected as the optimized one for both ptc and pts for ma and mw laden surface water treatment worth noting is that although ptc1 5 and pts1 5 were superior to the non polymerized ones in terms of coagulation performance the optimal dosage of ptc1 5 and pts1 5 is 5 mg l higher than that of ptc0 and pts0 table 2 shows that ptc had advantage around 10 higher removal of organic matter over pts for both ma and mw treatment coagulation capability of the hydrolysates of the coagulant was the key to influence the coagulation efficiency we have detected kinds of hydrolysates for effective coagulation 23 24 but the dominant ones were still unclear higher amounts of the dominant hydrolysates for coagulation were the probable reason for the superiority of ptc to pts moreover compared with the mw surface water ptc was more capable for the ma laden surface water treatment as evidenced by the enhanced uv254 and doc removal up to respect 70 0 and 86 0 around in comparison with the conventional polyaluminum chloride pac although it was widely used for algae laden surface water treatment 29 30 the pac was not as capable as ptc and pts for simultaneous removal of natural organic matter and algae polytitanium coagulants will be the promising environmental friendly reagents due to both high efficient water purification and the sludge recovery and reuse 3 2 solution ph dependence of ptc and pts coagulation for ma and mw laden surface water since solution ph is a key factor influencing hydrolysis of the coagulants adjustment of the ph of the test water is a common used strategy to enhance the coagulation performance coagulant dosage of 30 0 mg l and b value of 1 5 were chosen for both ptc and pts to investigate their dependence of coagulation on solution ph for ma and mw laden water treatment fig 3 the ph values of 5 7 9 and 11 were chosen for comparison at ph 5 regardless of ma or mw laden surface water increase of pts dosage led to sharp increase of residual turbidity which was accompanied by apparent deterioration of both algae and uv254 removal only pts dosage of 5 0 mg l was acceptable for practical engineering application with residual turbidity algae removal uv254 removal of around 3 0 ntu 50 0 90 0 respectively significant advantage of ptc over pts was observed in terms of the removal of turbidity algae and organic matter worth noting was the strong coagulation capability of ptc for ma species removal removal efficiency between 82 0 and 92 0 within wide range of ptc dosage from 5 to 60 mg l the removal of uv254 by ptc could reach about 60 0 at low dosage range of 5 0 15 0 mg l while further increase of the ptc dosage led to continuous drop of organic matter removal in contrast with ph of 5 at solution ph of 11 pts was highly efficient for the removal of turbidity and ma species in wide range of dosage range 5 60 mg l but the removal of uv254 was lower than 40 fig 3d therein residual turbidity varied at about 1 8 0 2 ntu and ma removal efficiency was approximately 94 0 4 0 results indicated that at ph 11 the hydrolyzed titanium species from pts were mainly responsible for algae removal not for organic matter removal similarly coagulation capability of pts was also much stronger at ph 11 than ph 5 in case of mw laden surface water treatment the 96 0 removal of mw species was accompanied by 60 0 removal of uv254 within pts dosage of 50 0 60 0 mg l at low pts dosage of 5 0 30 0 mg l the hydrolyzed titanium species were speculated to first react with mw species not the uv254 representative organics as evidenced by the high mw removal of 70 0 90 0 and the uv254 removal of lower than 28 0 same conclusions could be obtained in ptc case and ptc showed superior coagulation performance for ma laden surface water treatment than mw laden surface water when ptc and pts were added into test water they first underwent hydrolytic process to form ti x o y oh z cl n h2o m 4x 2 y z n 23 and ti a o b oh c hso4 x so4 y h2o z 4 a 2 b c x 2 y 24 respectively followed by their reaction with pollutants solution ph of the test water directly affected the charges of the hydrolyzed products which were the key to influence the coagulation capability of coagulants at ph 11 abundant hydroxyl facilitated the hydrolysis of ptc and pts resulting in the hydrolyzed specie with less positive charges sometimes ti oh 4 precipitates they were more likely to paly the role of adsorption and bridging during coagulation process for the removal of large algae species while the organic matter in the test water were tended to be flocculated by charge neutralization this might be used to explain the priority of ptc and pts for algae removal at solution ph 11 in contrast at solution ph of 7 and 9 ptc and pts were speculated to produce various poly nuclear hydroxyl polymers with more positive charges when they were added in test water the hydrolyzed products were supposed to be capable for the removal of pollutants through charge neutralization adsorption and bridging and sweep flocculation this might be the reason for simultaneous removal of both algae and organic matter at solution ph of 7 and 9 fig 3b and c besides solution ph coagulation performance of ptc and pts largely depended on dosage of the coagulants compared with the case of ph 11 synergic removal of algae species and organic matters could be achieved in lower dosage conditions at solution ph of 7 and 9 especially in case of pts wherein simultaneous removal of algae 95 0 and organic matter 60 0 could be achieved at 30 0 mg l around while in ph 11 50 0 mg l of pts was required worth noting was that at solution ph 7 ptc showed significant advantage over pts for ma laden surface water treatment with 95 0 99 0 of algae removal in wide range of dosage range from 25 0 to 60 0 mg l moreover the removal of organic matter by ptc could reach 80 0 about 20 0 higher than the cases of pts coagulation however at solution ph 9 comparable performance could be achieved by pts coagulation at lower dosage than ptc thus pts coagulant was the preferred one for both ma and mw laden surface water in real engineering applications 3 3 optimized coagulation conditions of ptc and pts solution ph influence on coagulation performance of ptc and pts at varied b values were studied in this study with the results being presented in supporting information s1 and s2 according to both coagulant dosage and solution ph dependence of coagulation with ptc and pts the optimized conditions and performances of coagulation for both ma and mw laden surface water purification are presented in table 3 the optimized b value of ptc and pts was 1 5 and the optimized dosage was 30 0 mg l the optimized solution ph varied from 7 9 under the optimized coagulation conditions obvious advantage of ptc was observed over pts in terms of turbidity algae and organic matter removal regardless of ma or mw laden surface water treatment in case of ptc coagulation residual turbidity was at around 1 0 ntu which was the widely accepted value for water purification standards almost complete removal of algae about 99 0 could be achieved by ptc coagulation with simultaneous removal of organic matter with high efficiency up to 60 0 of uv254 and 80 0 of doc removal in contrast residual turbidity after pts coagulation was around 2 0 ntu and what s worse was the 20 30 lower of doc removal than ptc case moreover ph of the effluent after pts coagulation was about 3 5 which was much lower than the value of 5 0 around in ptc case low effluent ph needed to be adjusted to near neutral before going to the next treatment unit or direct emission a big disadvantage of utilizing titanium based coagulants for water purification was the low effluent ph as previous studies reported 14 31 32 thus pre hydrolyzed titanium coagulants were preferred than the non prehydrolyzed ones 33 researchers also tried to use flocculant aid such as polyacrylamide pam 34 compound bioflocculant cbf 35 and polydimethyldiallyl ammonium chloride pdmdaac 36 etc to enhance the titanium coagulation at low dosages of titanium coagulants even though these strategies were proved effective to improve the effluent ph we suggest to employ the titanium coagulants those could produce the effluent with the effluent ph near to neutral analysis of the zeta potential of the coagulated flocs is a common used method to explore the coagulation mechanisms 37 charge neutralization and sweep flocculation are the widely used mechanisms of coagulation 38 zeta potential values of the ptc coagulated flocs were about 6 4 and 7 1 mv for ma and mw laden surface water respectively whilst in case of pts coagulation much higher values of zeta potential were observed about 0 4 and 1 9 mv respectively in cases of ma and mw laden surface water the foulants in raw ma and mw laden surface water had zeta potential values of 23 7 1 1 and 27 9 2 0 mv respectively change of zeta potential of the foulants was attributed to the reaction between coagulants and the foulants increase of the zeta potential values indicated that charge neutralization occurred during both ptc and pts coagulation procedure the higher values of zeta potential in pts case indicated that the hydrolyzed titanium species during pts coagulation had stronger capability of charge neutralization whilst in ptc case although ptc showed higher coagulation performance than pts the coagulated flocs had much lower values of zeta potential which indicated that besides charge neutralization sweep flocculation played key role during ptc coagulation process although the hydrolyzed species from pts had stronger charge neutralization capability when it was added into test water the coagulation efficiency was lower than ptc case this indicated that the purification of ma and mw laden surface water largely depended on sweep flocculation not only charge neutralization 3 4 2d flocculation zone of ptc and pts the optimized b value of 1 5 was selected for both ptc and pts to explore their 2d flocculation zone according to their combined dependence on coagulant dosage and solution ph fig 4 three kinds of symbols represents i the satisfied flocculation point residual turbidity 3 0 ntu algae removal 90 uv254 removal 50 ii unsatisfied flocculation point 3 0 ntu residual turbidity 10 0 ntu 80 algae removal 90 and 40 uv254 removal 50 and iii invisible flocculation point cloudy water respectively therein the satisfied points were circled as the satisfied flocculation zones the flocculation zones of ptc and pts coagulation were respectively defined according to residual turbidity algae removal efficiency ha removal efficiency and combination of the three fig 4d both ptc and pts showed broad zones of satisfied flocculation in terms of turbidity removal especially from neutral to alkaline ph fig 4a although the zones of satisfied flocculation narrowed down according to algae removal algae removal up to 90 0 could still be observed at ph 11 fig 4b different from fig 4a and b the satisfied uv254 removal 50 0 were mostly observed at acidic to neutral ph conditions fig 4c results indicated that at alkaline solution ph conditions especially ph 11 the hydrolyzed products from both ptc and pts were more capable for turbidity and algae removal rather than the removal of ha representative organic matters according to fig s1 s4 zeta potential of the coagulated flocs showed gradual decrease with increasing solution ph zeta potentials of the coagulated flocs at solution ph 11 varied from 15 0 to 25 0 mv this indicated that sweep flocculation was the primary coagulation mechanism which was responsible for the removal of turbidity and algae whilst at solution ph 5 9 zeta potentials of the coagulated flocs were much higher than those at solution ph 11 satisfied removal of uv254 50 0 at acidic to neutral ph conditions demonstrated that charge neutralization play important role for the removal of ha representative organic matters especially at solution ph 5 wherein zeta potential of the flocs were above 0 mv in all cases for both ma and mw laden surface water treatment synergic removal of algae turbidity and organic matters were expected thus the satisfied zones of flocculation with ptc and pts were selected according to simultaneous turbidity algae and ha removal fig 4d most of the satisfied points distributed at solution ph 7 9 conditions this corresponded well with the optimized solution ph observed in table 3 the recently developed titanium based coagulants receive wide attention mainly due to the recovery of the titanium coagulated sludge to produce functional nanoparticles tio2 39 40 worth noting is that the titanium tetrachloride was proved to show strong coagulation capability for simultaneous removal of natural organic matter and algae cells 27 and the algae rich titanium containing sludge could be recovered to produce functional tio2 which showed enhanced photocatalytic degradation of the phenolic like pollutants 39 the polytitanium coagulants both ptc and pts were superior to pac in terms of i high efficient and simultaneous removal of organic matter and algae from algae laden surface water and ii recovery of functional nanoparticles from titanium coagulated sludge determination of the satisfied 2d flocculation zones of titanium based coagulants will provide theoretical basis and facilitate their wide application for water treatment additionally in this study the concentration of algae cells in ma and mw laden surface water reached 106 cells ml and 105 cells ml respectively which was high enough to simulate the algae concentration during high algae laden period in real conditions thus both ptc and pts were speculated to be high efficient coagulants for simultaneous removal of natural organic matter and algae species in actual algae laden surface water treatment 4 conclusions this study utilized the recently developed polytitanium coagulants polytitanium chloride ptc and polytitanium sulfate pts for coagulation treatment of both microcystis aeruginosa ma and microcystis wesenbergii mw laden surface water both coagulation performance and coagulation mechanism of ptc and pts were highly dependent on coagulant dosage and solution ph basicity of the coagulants that was the varied degrees of pre hydrolysis was another key parameter under investigation pre hydrolysis of titanium coagulants could not only enhance the coagulation performance but also improve the effluent ph the basicity of 1 5 was optimized for both ptc and pts and the optimized dosage of 30 mg l and initial solution ph of 7 9 were determined according to synergic purification of turbidity algae and organic matters regardless of ma or mw laden surface water the ptc was found to be superior to pts in terms of high efficient removal of algae ca 99 9 and organic matters respective uv254 and doc removal of about 60 0 and 80 0 whilst 20 30 lower of doc removal was observed in pts case under the optimized conditions ptc coagulation was completed mainly by sweep flocculation while charge neutralization was the predominant mechanism for pts coagulation superior coagulation performance of ptc to pts indicated that the purification of ma and mw laden surface water largely depended on sweep flocculation not only charge neutralization satisfied removal of the ha like organics was observed at acidic to neutral ph conditions while the removal of turbidity and algae was more complete at alkaline solution ph conditions satisfied zones of coagulation for both ptc and pts were determined with their distribution at solution ph 7 9 conditions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing
