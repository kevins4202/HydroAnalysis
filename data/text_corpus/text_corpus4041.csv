20205,ships require regular inspection and maintenance for corrosion defects that appear due to the failure of protective coatings in corrosive environments however maintenance planning is inhibited by the fact that coating failures i e arrival of corrosion defects are random and physical models for coating degradation and subsequent corrosion progression require data that is usually unavailable in this paper the maintenance history of frigates in the royal australian navy is used to estimate the parameters of a non homogeneous poisson process that describes the statistical properties of the coating failures in specific compartments of a vessel a grouping heuristic is developed for fleet wide data aggregation and parameter estimation finally the predictions from these models are used to optimise the inspection and maintenance plan to simultaneously minimise the defect backlog and the unavailability of the ship due to repairs since detailed cost data is unavailable a case study is presented using data from a real fleet of eight ships and results show that 1 the grouping can slightly improve the generalization of the compartment models and 2 the trade off between the defect backlog and the ship unavailability is clearly displayed as the set of pareto optimal solutions of the bi objective optimisation keywords inspection maintenance non homogenous poisson process ship coating corrosion 1 introduction corrosion is a critical problem that can cause severe impacts to ship operations and reduces the lifetime of vessels in order to mitigate corrosion risks critical surfaces are typically coated with a protective paints eccles et al 2010 however due to a number of different mechanisms this coating degrades over time tator and tator 2015 and its failure can result in initiation of corrosion defects which are the primary cause of structural risks for the ship abbas and shafiee 2020 garbatov 2020 since many corrosion defects are not observable while at sea an effective inspection and maintenance strategy is needed to promptly identify coating failures and repair them before they result in severe corrosion and structural risks iacs 2017 because these inspections are costly and time consuming it is tempting to save costs time by deferring inspections particularly for difficult to access compartments however this deferral runs the risk of ignoring compartments that have accumulated large numbers of critical defects and are therefore unplanned maintenance liabilities indeed corrosion maintenance actions are frequently deferred to future overhauls button et al 2015 martin et al 2017 which can lead to the accumulation of a large number of unanticipated defects this surprise backlog can result in costly delays and deferral of preventive activities that harm the availability of the fleet thus blind deferral of maintenance can lead to a spiral of increasing maintenance costs as defect backlogs accumulate and gradually result in sole reliance on reactive maintenance which leads to less predictable maintenance schedules for both contractors and fleet operators martin et al 2017 therefore there is a need to rigorously optimise inspection plans to properly balance the costs of inspection and maintenance with corrosion risks to this end many studies have sought to exploit the large body of work on deterministic phenomenological models melchers 2005 paik et al 2004 qin and cui 2003 to predict corrosion luque et al 2014 utilised these deterministic models and thickness measurements within a bayesian network to predict corrosion losses for a real ship gardiner and melchers 2001 developed a model for the prediction of corrosion and analysed the variability with respect to different operational conditions e g temperature salt deposition time of wetness yazdi et al utilised a continuous bayesian networks model pitting induced by microbiological corrosion yazdi et al 2021 while these models have given some significant insight into the corrosion process they require data on thicknesses and operating conditions which can be difficult to obtain particularly for the entire ship corrosion maintenance has received significant attention castro et al 2011 developed an age based preventive maintenance policy using a poisson process for crack initiation and a gamma process for crack growth the model was applied to a numerical case study in the case of a component that is protected by a barrier corrosion initiation is primarily influenced by the degradation of this barrier indeed the rate of defect appearance is non decreasing as a coating degrades nicolai et al 2007 tator and tator 2015 this has motivated the use of non homogeneous poisson processes nhpps to model defect arrivals kuniewski et al 2009 assumed defect arrivals followed a general non homogeneous poisson process nhpp and subsequently conducted a simulation study on inspection policies nicolai et al 2007 employed a power law non homogeneous poisson process pl nhpp for modelling of corrosion defect arrivals other studies have focused on scheduling inspections using the paradigm of condition based maintenance cbm which utilizes corrosion measurements e g size depth to assess the need for maintenance cbm methods for ships have been extensively studied by frangopol and a number of colleagues dong and frangopol 2015 frangopol and soliman 2016 kim et al 2013 kwon and frangopol 2012 who developed several methodologies to address structural maintenance for cracking and corrosion degradation garbatov guedes soares utilised thickness loss data to plan preventative maintenance times garbatov and guedes soares 2009 2018 some studies have demonstrated that corrosion degradation conditions can also be used to inform mission abort policies in addition to inspection optimisation qiu and cui 2018 2019 zhao et al 2021 while cbm is typically preferred over time based maintenance tbm for real world applications truong ba et al 2021 cbm methods often require expensive monitoring technologies or difficult to obtain data for corrosion quantitative condition based approaches require detailed measurements on thickness loss which can be challenging and costly to acquire for all critical areas for every ship in a fleet luque et al 2014 another challenge in applying condition based inspections is the prediction of the initiation of thickness loss due to the breakdown of the protective coating indeed the coating life is quite uncertain and can comprise a majority of the life of a structural component on a navy vessel due to low corrosion margins necessary for such extreme performance demands eccles et al 2010 guedes soares et al analysed historical records for a fleet of tankers and found a coating life of 11 years for deck plates guedes soares et al 2009 while wang et al estimated a coating life of 6 5 3 years for a range of tanker structural members wang et al 2008 electrochemical techniques for the prediction of remaining coating life have been pursued bierwagen et al 2009 and recent attention has been paid to in situ measurements that can support a more robust condition based framework farinholt et al 2018 latif et al have proposed a cbm approach to optimally plan recoating of metallic structures but noted that significant effort is required to collect the required historical data latif et al 2019 however predicting the time of coating failure requires reliable condition data that is not yet available in contrast to hull thickness and operational parameters visual inspection reports are usually much easier to obtain more readily available in historical data sets and likely to be collected in even greater volume as remote inspection techniques become more prevalent liu et al 2018 moreover visual inspection protocols that take specific note of coating failure have been standard practice for some time eccles et al 2010 iacs 2017 essentially these reports produce an interval censored observation of the time of coating breakdown but do not have the thickness measurements necessary to pursue one of the aforementioned cbm approaches it is therefore desirable to use visual inspection data to plan ship inspections since 1 it is relatively easy and inexpensive to collect for the entire ship over the entire fleet compared to thickness and coating data 2 visual inspections methods could serve as an important supplement for planning inspections of less critical compartments sections of the ship even when cbm is employed for critical sections however methods for inspection maintenance planning based on visual inspections are lacking in literature in summary according to literature quantitative cbm with corrosion level measurements is indeed an excellent approach for managing the corrosion of ships however this approach requires the availability of detailed measurement e g thicknesses operational parameters for the entire ship which are usually impractical to obtain and in some scenarios only the time of corrosion initiation and coating failure is reliable moreover physical models for the breakdown of the protective coating are lacking and most literature use failure time distributions which inhibits the application of condition based techniques for coatings hence this study aims to develop an inspection maintenance strategy for a multi compartment ship that exploits available visual inspection data when superior cbm approach are infeasible the contributions of this study are two fold firstly the random time of coating breakdown and corrosion initiation are modelled using real historical inspection records and used to predict the distribution of the number of defects i e corrosion initiation in different sections of the ship secondly these predictions are used to formulate a multi objective optimisation problem to find and inspection and maintenance schedule that achieves the best trade off between the corrosion defect backlog and the total repair time i e the time in harbour dock the remainder of this paper is as follows section 2 discusses fitting of stochastic point processes models to real data model selection criteria are used to discriminate between a homogenous poisson process hpp and non homogenous poisson processes nhpp then a novel algorithm for grouping ship compartments with similar defect arrival rates using nhpp parameters is presented section 3 describes an inspection and maintenance optimisation methodology which uses defect arrival predictions from these models a case study is presented in section 4 using real ship data firstly fitted grouped hpp nhpp models are presented for a sample compartment along with a summary of fleetwide model performance secondly inspection and maintenance optimisation is performed using grouped hpp nhpp models so that defect backlog and service cost are minimised over the remaining life of a ship 2 defect arrivals parameter estimation in contrast to thickness data visual inspections provide only the time a defect was observed in a particular section i e compartment of the ship 1 1 while the inspection data often contains a subjective severity rating they are often unreliable furthermore a corrosion defect usually progresses quickly compared to the time before its appearance coating breakdown wang et al 2008 thus the defect severity is ignored and it is assumed that once a defect is noted in the inspection logs it must be repaired in a certain amount of time while defect appearances occur randomly an older coating tends to provide less protection and breaks down more frequently nicolai et al 2007 thus it is expected that as a coating ages the time between defect initiations may decrease in this section the model for the corrosion initiation i e defect arrivals is developed and techniques are developed to estimate the model parameters with limited data 2 1 a model for corrosion defect initiation based on maintenance data in this work the time of defect arrival is modelled as a stochastic point processes ross 2014 due to physical considerations it is possible that arrival rates could be non homogenous nicolai et al 2007 and in particular increasing with time in both maintenance and corrosion literature one well accepted method for modelling increasing intensities is the power law non homogeneous poisson process pl nhpp which has the arrival intensity babishin and taghipour 2016 nicolai et al 2007 yang et al 2017 1 λ t β α β t β 1 where α and β are the scale and shape parameters respectively with this model β 1 indicates an ageing coating while β 1 indicates that the coating is stable thus the defect arrivals for a degrading coating will follow a pl nhpp while the arrival of defects for a stable coating will follow a homogenous poisson process hpp to estimate the parameters of the model for eq 1 maximum likelihood estimation mle can be utilised on historical data and one can select between the pl nhpp and hpp using standard model selection techniques for inspection planning the visual inspection data is described as follows consider a certain compartment m on ship s which has h s m historical inspection times t s m 0 t s m 1 t s m h s m 1 at each inspection time a number of defects arrivals in the compartment n s m 0 n s m 1 n s m h s m 1 are observed the historical data can then be represented as the set 2 d s m t s m 0 t s m 1 n s m 0 t s m 1 t s m 2 n s m 1 t s m h s m 1 t s m h s m n s m h s m 1 according to the intensity in eq 1 the probability that n s m ℓ arrivals happen in the time period between inspection ℓ and ℓ 1 is 3 f n s m ℓ α β p n s m ℓ λ t s m ℓ t s m ℓ 1 n s m ℓ n s m ℓ e λ t s m ℓ t s m ℓ 1 where λ t s m ℓ t s m ℓ 1 is the cumulative intensity 4 λ t s m ℓ t s m ℓ 1 t s m ℓ t s m ℓ

is considered to be the more likely model 2 2 grouping statistically similar ship compartments in principle the model parameters for corrosion defect arrival should be identified for each compartment of each ship in the fleet via eq 5 however this approach has an important drawback it requires inspection data for every ship compartment combination in the fleet this may result in poor or no parameter estimates for many compartments and it does not acknowledge that the same compartment may exist on many ships in the fleet yet naïvely fitting a single set of parameters to all identical compartments is also suboptimal there is significant unit to unit variation of coating degradation due to different operating conditions e g temperature time of wetness mechanical load latif et al 2019 and quality of the applied coating tator and tator 2015 thus care must be taken to fit common parameters i e group only to compartments that have plausibly similar degradation patterns this section will discuss a methodology to identify ships that have statistically similar versions of the same compartment first consider a compartment m and let s 1 2 s denote the indices of all ships under consideration thus d s m s s is the inspection data available for fitting degradation model s for compartment m let the set of indices belonging to the i th group be denoted as g i s i 1 2 n g and let the collection of these sets be p g i i 1 2 n g this collection must form a partition of the ship compartment indices 8 i 1 n g g i s g i g j i j a common set of parameters can be identified for the i th group by maximising the group likelihood 9 α ˆ i β ˆ i arg max α β ℓ α β g i s g i ℓ α β d s m in order to identify statistically similar groups the following likelihood ratio may be used 10 r i j ℓ α ˆ i β ˆ i g j ℓ α ˆ j β ˆ j g j 0 where α ˆ i β ˆ i are the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters for group i the proximity of the ratio defined in eq 10 to zero indicates how well α ˆ i β ˆ i fit the data in a different group j thus providing a measure of similarity of two groups i and j thus a criterion for selecting similar groups might be to select the two data sets whose worst case likelihood ratio is closest to zero 11 i j argmax i j i j min log r i j log r j i a new group collection p g i i 1 2 n g can be then be generated by combining these two groups 12 p g m g m g m m j m i g m g i g j m i g m g m 1 j m n g where n g n g 1 is the number of groups in the new collection since the advantage of grouping is a reduction in the number of parameters its quality can be evaluated by aicc of the grouping 13 a i c p 2 n p 2 i 1 n g ℓ α ˆ i β ˆ i g i 2 n p 2 2 n p h i n p 1 where 14 n p i 1 n g n i and n i is the number of parameters for group i two for nhpp one for hpp and h i s g i h s m is the total number of data points over all groups if the aicc of the new grouping is lower than the current partition then the new grouping is adopted as the current and the algorithm can continue until the aicc of the n g is higher than the current n g this approach is summarised in algorithm 1 image 1 this greedy algorithm above can lead to the final grouping combination in a short time however it is possible that the greedy approach may lead to a poor local optimum in order to overcome this situation the greedy algorithm is augmented with a rollout heuristic and the overall approach is summarised in algorithm 2 image 2 3 inspection maintenance optimisation in order to mitigate the effects of corrosion ships sections compartments are typically inspected on a regular basis if corrosion defects are found they are added to the repair queue vessel overhauls will require all defects in a compartment to be repaired before work can continue thus the accumulation of many corrosion defects will interfere with vessel operations significantly and must be avoided once a defect in the protective coating is observed during the visual inspection of a compartment corrosion will progress at that location and reduce structural reliability of the vessel in this section an inspection maintenance optimisation methodology is developed to balance the time spent in dock harbour downtime and the length of the defect backlog using the compartment defect arrival models from section 2 while it is typically preferable to optimise the trade off between maintenance costs and failure risks this approach was not desirable for the case study presented in section 4 instead the repair time for a corrosion defect was used as a proxy for maintenance costs for two reasons 1 the unavailability of historical maintenance costs 2 maintainers emphasized the need to maintain operational readiness of the fleet rather than an emphasis on costs moreover the corrosion defect backlog was used as a proxy for ship condition because of the lack of historical severity data which would be required for a detailed failure risk assessment the multi objective approach adopted here is designed to assist these maintenance decision makers in understanding the relationship between the availability of the ship and the ship s condition quantified by the defect backlog without the need for elucidating difficult to estimate costs from experts consider a ship s with m 1 2 m compartments whose age is t the inspection and maintenance plan is to be optimised from the current time t n o w until the end of the ship s operational life t e o l i e t t n o w t e o l for the m t h compartment the expected number of defects that arrive over a time interval t t 1 t 2 t 1 t 2 can be computed from the model 15 e d s m t 1 t 2 1 α s m t 2 t 1 hpp 1 α s m β s m t 2 β s m t 1 β s m nhpp consider the optimal inspection times for the remaining life of the ship t s m τ s m ℓ ℓ 1 2 l s m t n o w τ s m ℓ t e o l where l s m is the number of inspection occasions since costs of failure are not available and difficult to obtain in general a multi objective approach will be pursued which will seek to simultaneously minimise both the defects present on the ship and the downtime i e time the ship is in dock for inspections repairs the first objective of the inspection plan is to minimise the time average of the expected defects present on the ship over its remaining lifetime to this end the expected number of defects to arrive in compartment m at the ℓ t h inspection d s m p ℓ may be computed as 16 d s m p ℓ t s m d s m e d s m τ s m ℓ 1 τ s m ℓ ℓ 1 e d s m τ s m ℓ 1 τ s m ℓ 1 ℓ l s m 1 where τ s m 0 and τ s m l s m 1 t k are defined as the last inspection time in the historical record and the operational life of the ship respectively and d s m is the known number of defects remaining from the last inspection in the historical record the time averaged the expected number of defects over a ship s remaining life is computed as 17 d t s 1 t s 2 t s m δ t t k t n o w m 1 m ℓ 1 l s m 1 d s m p ℓ where δ t is the epoch length the second objective is to minimise the time devoted to repairing defects over the remaining life of the ship which shall be computed using the assumption that all defects found during and inspection are repaired the expected number of defects that are repaired in a compartment during the remaining life of the ship can be computed as 18 d s m r t s m ℓ 1 l s m d s m p ℓ where d s m r 0 in the case where l s m 0 i e there are no inspections for compartment m let the time taken to repair a single corrosion defect n in compartment m be denoted as the random variable t s m n r these repair times are assumed to be identically distributed for all compartments with expected value t s m r the expected total time spent repairing defects in compartment m over the life of the ship can be computed as 19 t r s m t s m n 1 e n 1 n t s m n r p d s m r n t s m r n 1 n 1 n p d s m r n t s m r n 1 n p d s m r n t s m r e d s m r let the time cost of accessing a compartment and setting up any necessary equipment be denoted as c m under the proposed maintenance plan the expected total repair time for the entire ship over its remaining life can be computed as 20 r t s 1 t s 2 t s m h t s m 1 m c m l s m t r s m t s m t s ℓ m ℓ t s m i e the set of times where at least one compartment inspection occurs h is the cost of bringing the ship into harbour and denotes set cardinality for an inspection plan to be considered feasible it must ensure structural safety for the remaining life of the vessel which depends on the severity of corrosion defect since the inspection data does not have a reliable severity indicator the defect age is used as a proxy for the severity and a constraint is placed on the maximum allowable age let the maximum age of a defect in a compartment over an inspection interval τ s m ℓ 1 τ s m ℓ be a s m τ s m ℓ 1 τ s m ℓ which is obviously either the age of the first defect arriving in this inspection interval or the time since the arrival of the first defect in the historical backlog let x be the random arrival time of the first defect after τ s m ℓ 1 and σ s m be the arrival time of the oldest defect in the historical record the maximum age at inspection time τ s m ℓ is computed as 21 a s m τ s m ℓ 1 τ s m ℓ τ s m 1 σ s m ℓ 1 d s m 0 max 0 τ s m ℓ x 1 ℓ l s m 1 or ℓ 1 d s m 0 the term max 0 τ s m ℓ x is to address the special case that no defect arrives in the interval τ s m ℓ 1 τ s m ℓ i e the first defect arrives after τ s m ℓ according to the properties of an nhpp process ross 2014 the arrival time of first defect after time z has the following pdf 22 f 1 x z λ x e λ z x β α β x β 1 e z β x β α β where λ z x is cumulative intensity from eq 4 then the expected maximum age of defects present in compartment m can be computed as 23 a s m τ s m ℓ 1 τ s m

of a defect objectives d and r are given by equations 17 and 20 respectively the multi objective optimisation problem in 24 is solved in the following manner pareto optimal solutions for this problem are found in the following manner the objective is scalarized using the weighted sum method after normalisation using the maximum possible values for each objective which are obtainable by inspecting every possible time interval r m a x or never inspecting d m a x 25 j t s 1 t s 2 t s m w r t s 1 t s 2 t s m r m a x 1 w d t s 1 t s 2 t s m d m a x e a t s 1 t s 2 t s m where 0 w 1 and the penalty

and i a s m τ s m ℓ 1 τ s m ℓ a is an indicator function denoting the violation of a the scalarized problem is solved as follows firstly the possible inspection ages are specified as a discrete grid t k k 1 2 k where t k t e o l is the operational life of the ship t 1 t n o w t s m l m is the first possible future inspection time and the minimum time permitted between inspections is δ t t k 1 t k which is an arbitrary positive constant let the binary variable x s m k 0 1 be one if compartment m is inspected at time k and zero otherwise which has a one to one correspondence with the inspection schedules t s m the values of x s m k may then be optimised using typical 0 1 nonlinear programming methods in this study a 0 1 genetic algorithm ga is used to optimise x s m k which is then used to obtain t s m m 1 2 m 4 case study of real ship data the proposed approach was applied to data from a real ship using 8600 inspection reports that were recorded over a period of 20 years for a fleet of 8 ships with identical compartment configurations these reports detail among other things the inspection times the number of corrosion defects found during a particular inspection as well as whether or not they were repaired inspection records did not start from the date of a ship s launch so defect reports collected on the first inspection were not used for parameter estimation as a result the number of defects that arrived between inspections can be calculated to provide d s m eq 2 for each of the m 1 2 m compartments and all s 1 2 8 ships data for the first 18 years were used for parameter fitting while data from the last two years was reserved for testing validation only ship compartments with at least four inspections i e twice the maximum number of parameters were selected for analysis as a result more than 6300 corrosion defect reports were available for subsequent fitting of defect arrival models for the fleet covering anywhere between 20 and 103 compartments per ship depending on the particular ship overall 129 compartments had at least one ship with sufficient information for modelling 4 1 data grouping for ship compartment defect models defect arrival data for each compartment were grouped using the aforementioned likelihood heuristic section 2 2 the inspection records for the fleet started at approximately the same clock time for each ship but the launch dates for each ship varied significantly thus the age of the first recorded inspection occasion for this compartment varied by up to 5 years no inspection and repair information collected prior to this first inspection was available so any defects found upon this first occasion were discarded and arrival parameters were fit by age as described in section 2 1 fig 1 a shows the cumulative defect arrivals for an example compartment for each ship in the fleet a h the proposed fitting and grouping approach from algorithm 2 in section 2 2 identified three distinct groups which can be seen in fig 1 b importantly the cumulative arrivals appear to have shapes consistent with a power law intensity which is further supported by the overall quality of the fits in fig 1 b in this example the defect arrival rates vary significantly a very high defect arrival rate was observed when ship b was 5 years of age resulting in vastly different model parameters which the grouping heuristic identified and statistically distinct and not suitable for grouping with the others this initial rapid arrival of corrosion defects could be due to poor data recording adverse operational conditions e g outstanding exposure to heat miszczyk and darowicki 2001 or moisture morsch et al 2015 and or poor initial application of the coating itself tator and tator 2015 young ships with a paucity of corrosion defect reports benefit the most from the grouping heuristic fig 1 b shows that the defect arrival rate in the youngest ship ship h was placed into group 3 with 2 other ships in the fleet the statistical similarity of defect arrival rates in this group implies that each ship had similar coating performance in this compartment and they were treated as such by the model by grouping the model for a 14 year old ship ship h with other ships up to 21 years of age ship a pl nhpp parameters could be fit using defect reports for an older ship with similar coating performance thus model parameters for the arrival of corrosion defects in ship h could be informed by a larger number of reports from older ships allowing for more confident prediction of future defect arrivals the grouping heuristic was subsequently applied to all ship compartments that were suitable for modelling fig 2 illustrates the number of grouped compartments between pairs of ships i e the number of compartments with common model parameters as an example ships a and g have 33 39 compartments with statistically similar defect arrival models while ships g and f have quite different arrival characteristics this difference could be due to variations in the quality of the coating system or the operating conditions to which they were exposed dissimilar ship pairs warrant further investigation into the nature of these variations e g which ship tends to have higher arrival rates additional information pertaining to the operational conditions could further illuminate the origin of these dissimilarities in coating performance the quality of the predictions was assessed as follows the estimated parameters and the probability mass function eq 3 were used to compute the predicted 95 confidence interval for the test data i e last two years and the result is compared to the actual data this comparison is illustrated in fig 3 where the blue circles denote the test data points i e points not used for parameter estimation the solid red line is expected number of arrivals and the dashed black lines are the 95 confidence interval this procedure was performed for all ship compartment models in the fleet the training data is summarised in table 1 and the validation results are presented in table 2 all of the predicted confidence intervals contain more than 85 of the test data points over all of the compartments which is quite reasonable given that parameter uncertainty was neglected in this prediction the effects of grouping can be seen in table 2 both the individual and grouped fits provide a significant improvement over almost all of the single group i e one model fit to the entire fleet data models grouping results in an increased proportion of pl nhpp models compared with the individual fits but less than the single group fits since the arrival of corrosion defects is expected to increase as the protective coating degrades it is expected that pl nhpp is more appropriate and this is supported by the single group fit when the data is sufficient most compartments have pl nhpp models whereas the individual compartment models appear to have insufficient data to support the extra parameter in many cases however as noted above the individual models provide superior predictions compared to the single group fits left side of table 2 the grouped models are between these two extremes the grouping algorithm strategically aggregates the data to support the pl nhpp models expected from the physics of the process while also maintaining even slightly improving the prediction performance indeed the grouped fits performed slightly better than the individual fits across the fleet with the exception of ship g which yields a sizable improvement the validation results for ship g are a more extreme example of the advantage of considering fleetwide data when fitting defect arrival parameters individual fits give a high hpp selection rate and unusually poor performance in validation grouping statistically similar data from the rest of the fleet when modelling compartments in this ship resulted in improved validation performance and more frequent identification of an increasing defect arrival rate that would otherwise go undetected if only data from ship g is considered moreover using fleet data can enable modelling for compartments that would otherwise have insufficient historical records in such as case younger ships can inherit parameters that were estimated by fitting a single model to the entire fleet for the same compartment single group model for example the historical records for ship h contain 20 compartments for which sufficient data exists to conduct model parameter estimation since the last 2 years of this record were reserved for testing the training data was only adequate for modelling 13 of these 20 compartments predictions for the remaining 7 compartments were constructed using shared parameters for the other ships in the fleet i e a single group model is fit the resulting pl nhpp parameters were inherited by ship h and are shown in fig 4 the number of corrosion defects observed on a subsequent test inspection fell well within the prediction interval of the inherited model furthermore all test data in the 7 compartments fell within prediction interval of compartment models inherited by ship h single group partition parameter estimates can provide accurate predictions of corrosion defect arrivals for younger ships in a fleet while data is being collected to support more specific models 4 2 maintenance optimisation for a ship from fleet data in this section the inspection plan for a ship is optimised using methods described in section 3 the values for downtime costs associated with harbouring compartment access and various types of defect repairs are listed in table 3 which are based on conversations with hull maintainers and the organisation s internal documents the ship age was discretised into epochs of δ t 4 months and the parameters of the defect arrival model were estimated according to the methods discussed in section 3 and the inspection plan optimisation time horizon is set to t e o l t n o w 7 years the inspection plan was optimised over this time horizon using the methods in section 3 fig 5 shows pareto fronts for the simultaneous minimisation of the two objectives repair time and defects present for different values of the age constraint a the scheduling of additional inspection and maintenance actions where r 0 5 years exhibits a linear decrease in defects present when the total repair time exceeds 1 year additional actions produce diminishing reductions in the expected defects present indeed no amount of additional service time could reduce d below 68 due to the minimum time between inspections it can be seen that the defect age constraint only becomes active when w is sufficiently high emphasising minimisation of repair time and the inspection frequency needs to be increased to ensure satisfaction of the constraint the most extreme case of this effect can be seen in the magnified part of the pareto front in fig 5 which shows for the w 1 a 3 case the minimal r is achieved at a large increase in d the circled solution in the expansion of fig 5 is an example of an optimised plan for which the defect age constraint was active thus opportunities for further minimisation of d were not possible fig 6 presents historical and predicted defects appearing over the life of the ship with the application of some optimised plans for inspection and maintenance represented in fig 5 the time of the first possible inspection t n o w is marked with a vertical line inspection and repair events as blue points and 95 confidence intervals are presented as dotted lines defect arrivals between the most recent inspection in the historical record and the next possible inspection τ m 0 t n o w were computed using the estimated models therefore expected values for the defects present for the entire ship between 13 years of age and t n o w were composed from a combination of historical records and model predictions due to variation in τ m 0 in different compartments all optimised plans yielded immediate inspection at t n o w due to the large defect backlog for this particular ship it is also interesting to note that the optimal plans are sometimes periodic fig 6 a and 6 c and sometimes non periodic fig 6 b and 6 d interestingly for all optimised plans the longest inspection interval was reserved for the last interval resulting in the maximum number of defects occurring at t e o l this can be attributed to the retirement of the ship at the end of the horizon where defects no longer need to be repaired and thus incur no repair time costs this behaviour can be seen in fig 6 b where the non periodic inspection plan has a final inspection very soon after the second to last inspection in order to satisfy the age constraint while allowing the maximum number of defects to accumulate in the last interval 5 conclusion in this paper historical inspection data provided by the royal australian navy was used to fit arrival rates for corrosion defects onboard a fleet of frigates stochastic point process model fitting revealed that defect arrival rates increased as the vessels aged and this was attributed to the degradation of the protective coatings a novel grouping heuristic for model fitting and the identification of statistically similar ship compartments provided a balance between specificity and data availability when predicting the arrival of future defects the defect arrival rates predicted by these models performed well for all ships in the fleet models for younger ships inherited additional benefit from data collected on older ships enabling accurate short term prediction of arrival rates when such a prediction would otherwise be unfeasible a bi objective optimisation utilised the arrival models to plan future inspection and maintenance actions an appropriate compromise between a reduction in defects present and improved operational readiness was obtained without violating safety constraints the methodology presented here provides a practical and simple approach for maintainers to understand future degradation needs and plan inspection activities across the fleet this work presents three distinct opportunities for future investigation firstly the development of more flexible inspection policies where inspection and repair efforts are applied intelligently to compartments with more numerous defects secondly the defect arrival models can be combined with physical corrosion models to model the progression of defect severity which was neglected in the current work thirdly a better understanding of the coating degradation characteristics may motivate a more sophisticated approaches e g more general intensity functions besides the power law or condition

20205,ships require regular inspection and maintenance for corrosion defects that appear due to the failure of protective coatings in corrosive environments however maintenance planning is inhibited by the fact that coating failures i e arrival of corrosion defects are random and physical models for coating degradation and subsequent corrosion progression require data that is usually unavailable in this paper the maintenance history of frigates in the royal australian navy is used to estimate the parameters of a non homogeneous poisson process that describes the statistical properties of the coating failures in specific compartments of a vessel a grouping heuristic is developed for fleet wide data aggregation and parameter estimation finally the predictions from these models are used to optimise the inspection and maintenance plan to simultaneously minimise the defect backlog and the unavailability of the ship due to repairs since detailed cost data is unavailable a case study is presented using data from a real fleet of eight ships and results show that 1 the grouping can slightly improve the generalization of the compartment models and 2 the trade off between the defect backlog and the ship unavailability is clearly displayed as the set of pareto optimal solutions of the bi objective optimisation keywords inspection maintenance non homogenous poisson process ship coating corrosion 1 introduction corrosion is a critical problem that can cause severe impacts to ship operations and reduces the lifetime of vessels in order to mitigate corrosion risks critical surfaces are typically coated with a protective paints eccles et al 2010 however due to a number of different mechanisms this coating degrades over time tator and tator 2015 and its failure can result in initiation of corrosion defects which are the primary cause of structural risks for the ship abbas and shafiee 2020 garbatov 2020 since many corrosion defects are not observable while at sea an effective inspection and maintenance strategy is needed to promptly identify coating failures and repair them before they result in severe corrosion and structural risks iacs 2017 because these inspections are costly and time consuming it is tempting to save costs time by deferring inspections particularly for difficult to access compartments however this deferral runs the risk of ignoring compartments that have accumulated large numbers of critical defects and are therefore unplanned maintenance liabilities indeed corrosion maintenance actions are frequently deferred to future overhauls button et al 2015 martin et al 2017 which can lead to the accumulation of a large number of unanticipated defects this surprise backlog can result in costly delays and deferral of preventive activities that harm the availability of the fleet thus blind deferral of maintenance can lead to a spiral of increasing maintenance costs as defect backlogs accumulate and gradually result in sole reliance on reactive maintenance which leads to less predictable maintenance schedules for both contractors and fleet operators martin et al 2017 therefore there is a need to rigorously optimise inspection plans to properly balance the costs of inspection and maintenance with corrosion risks to this end many studies have sought to exploit the large body of work on deterministic phenomenological models melchers 2005 paik et al 2004 qin and cui 2003 to predict corrosion luque et al 2014 utilised these deterministic models and thickness measurements within a bayesian network to predict corrosion losses for a real ship gardiner and melchers 2001 developed a model for the prediction of corrosion and analysed the variability with respect to different operational conditions e g temperature salt deposition time of wetness yazdi et al utilised a continuous bayesian networks model pitting induced by microbiological corrosion yazdi et al 2021 while these models have given some significant insight into the corrosion process they require data on thicknesses and operating conditions which can be difficult to obtain particularly for the entire ship corrosion maintenance has received significant attention castro et al 2011 developed an age based preventive maintenance policy using a poisson process for crack initiation and a gamma process for crack growth the model was applied to a numerical case study in the case of a component that is protected by a barrier corrosion initiation is primarily influenced by the degradation of this barrier indeed the rate of defect appearance is non decreasing as a coating degrades nicolai et al 2007 tator and tator 2015 this has motivated the use of non homogeneous poisson processes nhpps to model defect arrivals kuniewski et al 2009 assumed defect arrivals followed a general non homogeneous poisson process nhpp and subsequently conducted a simulation study on inspection policies nicolai et al 2007 employed a power law non homogeneous poisson process pl nhpp for modelling of corrosion defect arrivals other studies have focused on scheduling inspections using the paradigm of condition based maintenance cbm which utilizes corrosion measurements e g size depth to assess the need for maintenance cbm methods for ships have been extensively studied by frangopol and a number of colleagues dong and frangopol 2015 frangopol and soliman 2016 kim et al 2013 kwon and frangopol 2012 who developed several methodologies to address structural maintenance for cracking and corrosion degradation garbatov guedes soares utilised thickness loss data to plan preventative maintenance times garbatov and guedes soares 2009 2018 some studies have demonstrated that corrosion degradation conditions can also be used to inform mission abort policies in addition to inspection optimisation qiu and cui 2018 2019 zhao et al 2021 while cbm is typically preferred over time based maintenance tbm for real world applications truong ba et al 2021 cbm methods often require expensive monitoring technologies or difficult to obtain data for corrosion quantitative condition based approaches require detailed measurements on thickness loss which can be challenging and costly to acquire for all critical areas for every ship in a fleet luque et al 2014 another challenge in applying condition based inspections is the prediction of the initiation of thickness loss due to the breakdown of the protective coating indeed the coating life is quite uncertain and can comprise a majority of the life of a structural component on a navy vessel due to low corrosion margins necessary for such extreme performance demands eccles et al 2010 guedes soares et al analysed historical records for a fleet of tankers and found a coating life of 11 years for deck plates guedes soares et al 2009 while wang et al estimated a coating life of 6 5 3 years for a range of tanker structural members wang et al 2008 electrochemical techniques for the prediction of remaining coating life have been pursued bierwagen et al 2009 and recent attention has been paid to in situ measurements that can support a more robust condition based framework farinholt et al 2018 latif et al have proposed a cbm approach to optimally plan recoating of metallic structures but noted that significant effort is required to collect the required historical data latif et al 2019 however predicting the time of coating failure requires reliable condition data that is not yet available in contrast to hull thickness and operational parameters visual inspection reports are usually much easier to obtain more readily available in historical data sets and likely to be collected in even greater volume as remote inspection techniques become more prevalent liu et al 2018 moreover visual inspection protocols that take specific note of coating failure have been standard practice for some time eccles et al 2010 iacs 2017 essentially these reports produce an interval censored observation of the time of coating breakdown but do not have the thickness measurements necessary to pursue one of the aforementioned cbm approaches it is therefore desirable to use visual inspection data to plan ship inspections since 1 it is relatively easy and inexpensive to collect for the entire ship over the entire fleet compared to thickness and coating data 2 visual inspections methods could serve as an important supplement for planning inspections of less critical compartments sections of the ship even when cbm is employed for critical sections however methods for inspection maintenance planning based on visual inspections are lacking in literature in summary according to literature quantitative cbm with corrosion level measurements is indeed an excellent approach for managing the corrosion of ships however this approach requires the availability of detailed measurement e g thicknesses operational parameters for the entire ship which are usually impractical to obtain and in some scenarios only the time of corrosion initiation and coating failure is reliable moreover physical models for the breakdown of the protective coating are lacking and most literature use failure time distributions which inhibits the application of condition based techniques for coatings hence this study aims to develop an inspection maintenance strategy for a multi compartment ship that exploits available visual inspection data when superior cbm approach are infeasible the contributions of this study are two fold firstly the random time of coating breakdown and corrosion initiation are modelled using real historical inspection records and used to predict the distribution of the number of defects i e corrosion initiation in different sections of the ship secondly these predictions are used to formulate a multi objective optimisation problem to find and inspection and maintenance schedule that achieves the best trade off between the corrosion defect backlog and the total repair time i e the time in harbour dock the remainder of this paper is as follows section 2 discusses fitting of stochastic point processes models to real data model selection criteria are used to discriminate between a homogenous poisson process hpp and non homogenous poisson processes nhpp then a novel algorithm for grouping ship compartments with similar defect arrival rates using nhpp parameters is presented section 3 describes an inspection and maintenance optimisation methodology which uses defect arrival predictions from these models a case study is presented in section 4 using real ship data firstly fitted grouped hpp nhpp models are presented for a sample compartment along with a summary of fleetwide model performance secondly inspection and maintenance optimisation is performed using grouped hpp nhpp models so that defect backlog and service cost are minimised over the remaining life of a ship 2 defect arrivals parameter estimation in contrast to thickness data visual inspections provide only the time a defect was observed in a particular section i e compartment of the ship 1 1 while the inspection data often contains a subjective severity rating they are often unreliable furthermore a corrosion defect usually progresses quickly compared to the time before its appearance coating breakdown wang et al 2008 thus the defect severity is ignored and it is assumed that once a defect is noted in the inspection logs it must be repaired in a certain amount of time while defect appearances occur randomly an older coating tends to provide less protection and breaks down more frequently nicolai et al 2007 thus it is expected that as a coating ages the time between defect initiations may decrease in this section the model for the corrosion initiation i e defect arrivals is developed and techniques are developed to estimate the model parameters with limited data 2 1 a model for corrosion defect initiation based on maintenance data in this work the time of defect arrival is modelled as a stochastic point processes ross 2014 due to physical considerations it is possible that arrival rates could be non homogenous nicolai et al 2007 and in particular increasing with time in both maintenance and corrosion literature one well accepted method for modelling increasing intensities is the power law non homogeneous poisson process pl nhpp which has the arrival intensity babishin and taghipour 2016 nicolai et al 2007 yang et al 2017 1 λ t β α β t β 1 where α and β are the scale and shape parameters respectively with this model β 1 indicates an ageing coating while β 1 indicates that the coating is stable thus the defect arrivals for a degrading coating will follow a pl nhpp while the arrival of defects for a stable coating will follow a homogenous poisson process hpp to estimate the parameters of the model for eq 1 maximum likelihood estimation mle can be utilised on historical data and one can select between the pl nhpp and hpp using standard model selection techniques for inspection planning the visual inspection data is described as follows consider a certain compartment m on ship s which has h s m historical inspection times t s m 0 t s m 1 t s m h s m 1 at each inspection time a number of defects arrivals in the compartment n s m 0 n s m 1 n s m h s m 1 are observed the historical data can then be represented as the set 2 d s m t s m 0 t s m 1 n s m 0 t s m 1 t s m 2 n s m 1 t s m h s m 1 t s m h s m n s m h s m 1 according to the intensity in eq 1 the probability that n s m ℓ arrivals happen in the time period between inspection ℓ and ℓ 1 is 3 f n s m ℓ α β p n s m ℓ λ t s m ℓ t s m ℓ 1 n s m ℓ n s m ℓ e λ t s m ℓ t s m ℓ 1 where λ t s m ℓ t s m ℓ 1 is the cumulative intensity 4 λ t s m ℓ t s m ℓ 1 t s m ℓ t s m ℓ

is considered to be the more likely model 2 2 grouping statistically similar ship compartments in principle the model parameters for corrosion defect arrival should be identified for each compartment of each ship in the fleet via eq 5 however this approach has an important drawback it requires inspection data for every ship compartment combination in the fleet this may result in poor or no parameter estimates for many compartments and it does not acknowledge that the same compartment may exist on many ships in the fleet yet naïvely fitting a single set of parameters to all identical compartments is also suboptimal there is significant unit to unit variation of coating degradation due to different operating conditions e g temperature time of wetness mechanical load latif et al 2019 and quality of the applied coating tator and tator 2015 thus care must be taken to fit common parameters i e group only to compartments that have plausibly similar degradation patterns this section will discuss a methodology to identify ships that have statistically similar versions of the same compartment first consider a compartment m and let s 1 2 s denote the indices of all ships under consideration thus d s m s s is the inspection data available for fitting degradation model s for compartment m let the set of indices belonging to the i th group be denoted as g i s i 1 2 n g and let the collection of these sets be p g i i 1 2 n g this collection must form a partition of the ship compartment indices 8 i 1 n g g i s g i g j i j a common set of parameters can be identified for the i th group by maximising the group likelihood 9 α ˆ i β ˆ i arg max α β ℓ α β g i s g i ℓ α β d s m in order to identify statistically similar groups the following likelihood ratio may be used 10 r i j ℓ α ˆ i β ˆ i g j ℓ α ˆ j β ˆ j g j 0 where α ˆ i β ˆ i are the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters for group i the proximity of the ratio defined in eq 10 to zero indicates how well α ˆ i β ˆ i fit the data in a different group j thus providing a measure of similarity of two groups i and j thus a criterion for selecting similar groups might be to select the two data sets whose worst case likelihood ratio is closest to zero 11 i j argmax i j i j min log r i j log r j i a new group collection p g i i 1 2 n g can be then be generated by combining these two groups 12 p g m g m g m m j m i g m g i g j m i g m g m 1 j m n g where n g n g 1 is the number of groups in the new collection since the advantage of grouping is a reduction in the number of parameters its quality can be evaluated by aicc of the grouping 13 a i c p 2 n p 2 i 1 n g ℓ α ˆ i β ˆ i g i 2 n p 2 2 n p h i n p 1 where 14 n p i 1 n g n i and n i is the number of parameters for group i two for nhpp one for hpp and h i s g i h s m is the total number of data points over all groups if the aicc of the new grouping is lower than the current partition then the new grouping is adopted as the current and the algorithm can continue until the aicc of the n g is higher than the current n g this approach is summarised in algorithm 1 image 1 this greedy algorithm above can lead to the final grouping combination in a short time however it is possible that the greedy approach may lead to a poor local optimum in order to overcome this situation the greedy algorithm is augmented with a rollout heuristic and the overall approach is summarised in algorithm 2 image 2 3 inspection maintenance optimisation in order to mitigate the effects of corrosion ships sections compartments are typically inspected on a regular basis if corrosion defects are found they are added to the repair queue vessel overhauls will require all defects in a compartment to be repaired before work can continue thus the accumulation of many corrosion defects will interfere with vessel operations significantly and must be avoided once a defect in the protective coating is observed during the visual inspection of a compartment corrosion will progress at that location and reduce structural reliability of the vessel in this section an inspection maintenance optimisation methodology is developed to balance the time spent in dock harbour downtime and the length of the defect backlog using the compartment defect arrival models from section 2 while it is typically preferable to optimise the trade off between maintenance costs and failure risks this approach was not desirable for the case study presented in section 4 instead the repair time for a corrosion defect was used as a proxy for maintenance costs for two reasons 1 the unavailability of historical maintenance costs 2 maintainers emphasized the need to maintain operational readiness of the fleet rather than an emphasis on costs moreover the corrosion defect backlog was used as a proxy for ship condition because of the lack of historical severity data which would be required for a detailed failure risk assessment the multi objective approach adopted here is designed to assist these maintenance decision makers in understanding the relationship between the availability of the ship and the ship s condition quantified by the defect backlog without the need for elucidating difficult to estimate costs from experts consider a ship s with m 1 2 m compartments whose age is t the inspection and maintenance plan is to be optimised from the current time t n o w until the end of the ship s operational life t e o l i e t t n o w t e o l for the m t h compartment the expected number of defects that arrive over a time interval t t 1 t 2 t 1 t 2 can be computed from the model 15 e d s m t 1 t 2 1 α s m t 2 t 1 hpp 1 α s m β s m t 2 β s m t 1 β s m nhpp consider the optimal inspection times for the remaining life of the ship t s m τ s m ℓ ℓ 1 2 l s m t n o w τ s m ℓ t e o l where l s m is the number of inspection occasions since costs of failure are not available and difficult to obtain in general a multi objective approach will be pursued which will seek to simultaneously minimise both the defects present on the ship and the downtime i e time the ship is in dock for inspections repairs the first objective of the inspection plan is to minimise the time average of the expected defects present on the ship over its remaining lifetime to this end the expected number of defects to arrive in compartment m at the ℓ t h inspection d s m p ℓ may be computed as 16 d s m p ℓ t s m d s m e d s m τ s m ℓ 1 τ s m ℓ ℓ 1 e d s m τ s m ℓ 1 τ s m ℓ 1 ℓ l s m 1 where τ s m 0 and τ s m l s m 1 t k are defined as the last inspection time in the historical record and the operational life of the ship respectively and d s m is the known number of defects remaining from the last inspection in the historical record the time averaged the expected number of defects over a ship s remaining life is computed as 17 d t s 1 t s 2 t s m δ t t k t n o w m 1 m ℓ 1 l s m 1 d s m p ℓ where δ t is the epoch length the second objective is to minimise the time devoted to repairing defects over the remaining life of the ship which shall be computed using the assumption that all defects found during and inspection are repaired the expected number of defects that are repaired in a compartment during the remaining life of the ship can be computed as 18 d s m r t s m ℓ 1 l s m d s m p ℓ where d s m r 0 in the case where l s m 0 i e there are no inspections for compartment m let the time taken to repair a single corrosion defect n in compartment m be denoted as the random variable t s m n r these repair times are assumed to be identically distributed for all compartments with expected value t s m r the expected total time spent repairing defects in compartment m over the life of the ship can be computed as 19 t r s m t s m n 1 e n 1 n t s m n r p d s m r n t s m r n 1 n 1 n p d s m r n t s m r n 1 n p d s m r n t s m r e d s m r let the time cost of accessing a compartment and setting up any necessary equipment be denoted as c m under the proposed maintenance plan the expected total repair time for the entire ship over its remaining life can be computed as 20 r t s 1 t s 2 t s m h t s m 1 m c m l s m t r s m t s m t s ℓ m ℓ t s m i e the set of times where at least one compartment inspection occurs h is the cost of bringing the ship into harbour and denotes set cardinality for an inspection plan to be considered feasible it must ensure structural safety for the remaining life of the vessel which depends on the severity of corrosion defect since the inspection data does not have a reliable severity indicator the defect age is used as a proxy for the severity and a constraint is placed on the maximum allowable age let the maximum age of a defect in a compartment over an inspection interval τ s m ℓ 1 τ s m ℓ be a s m τ s m ℓ 1 τ s m ℓ which is obviously either the age of the first defect arriving in this inspection interval or the time since the arrival of the first defect in the historical backlog let x be the random arrival time of the first defect after τ s m ℓ 1 and σ s m be the arrival time of the oldest defect in the historical record the maximum age at inspection time τ s m ℓ is computed as 21 a s m τ s m ℓ 1 τ s m ℓ τ s m 1 σ s m ℓ 1 d s m 0 max 0 τ s m ℓ x 1 ℓ l s m 1 or ℓ 1 d s m 0 the term max 0 τ s m ℓ x is to address the special case that no defect arrives in the interval τ s m ℓ 1 τ s m ℓ i e the first defect arrives after τ s m ℓ according to the properties of an nhpp process ross 2014 the arrival time of first defect after time z has the following pdf 22 f 1 x z λ x e λ z x β α β x β 1 e z β x β α β where λ z x is cumulative intensity from eq 4 then the expected maximum age of defects present in compartment m can be computed as 23 a s m τ s m ℓ 1 τ s m

of a defect objectives d and r are given by equations 17 and 20 respectively the multi objective optimisation problem in 24 is solved in the following manner pareto optimal solutions for this problem are found in the following manner the objective is scalarized using the weighted sum method after normalisation using the maximum possible values for each objective which are obtainable by inspecting every possible time interval r m a x or never inspecting d m a x 25 j t s 1 t s 2 t s m w r t s 1 t s 2 t s m r m a x 1 w d t s 1 t s 2 t s m d m a x e a t s 1 t s 2 t s m where 0 w 1 and the penalty

and i a s m τ s m ℓ 1 τ s m ℓ a is an indicator function denoting the violation of a the scalarized problem is solved as follows firstly the possible inspection ages are specified as a discrete grid t k k 1 2 k where t k t e o l is the operational life of the ship t 1 t n o w t s m l m is the first possible future inspection time and the minimum time permitted between inspections is δ t t k 1 t k which is an arbitrary positive constant let the binary variable x s m k 0 1 be one if compartment m is inspected at time k and zero otherwise which has a one to one correspondence with the inspection schedules t s m the values of x s m k may then be optimised using typical 0 1 nonlinear programming methods in this study a 0 1 genetic algorithm ga is used to optimise x s m k which is then used to obtain t s m m 1 2 m 4 case study of real ship data the proposed approach was applied to data from a real ship using 8600 inspection reports that were recorded over a period of 20 years for a fleet of 8 ships with identical compartment configurations these reports detail among other things the inspection times the number of corrosion defects found during a particular inspection as well as whether or not they were repaired inspection records did not start from the date of a ship s launch so defect reports collected on the first inspection were not used for parameter estimation as a result the number of defects that arrived between inspections can be calculated to provide d s m eq 2 for each of the m 1 2 m compartments and all s 1 2 8 ships data for the first 18 years were used for parameter fitting while data from the last two years was reserved for testing validation only ship compartments with at least four inspections i e twice the maximum number of parameters were selected for analysis as a result more than 6300 corrosion defect reports were available for subsequent fitting of defect arrival models for the fleet covering anywhere between 20 and 103 compartments per ship depending on the particular ship overall 129 compartments had at least one ship with sufficient information for modelling 4 1 data grouping for ship compartment defect models defect arrival data for each compartment were grouped using the aforementioned likelihood heuristic section 2 2 the inspection records for the fleet started at approximately the same clock time for each ship but the launch dates for each ship varied significantly thus the age of the first recorded inspection occasion for this compartment varied by up to 5 years no inspection and repair information collected prior to this first inspection was available so any defects found upon this first occasion were discarded and arrival parameters were fit by age as described in section 2 1 fig 1 a shows the cumulative defect arrivals for an example compartment for each ship in the fleet a h the proposed fitting and grouping approach from algorithm 2 in section 2 2 identified three distinct groups which can be seen in fig 1 b importantly the cumulative arrivals appear to have shapes consistent with a power law intensity which is further supported by the overall quality of the fits in fig 1 b in this example the defect arrival rates vary significantly a very high defect arrival rate was observed when ship b was 5 years of age resulting in vastly different model parameters which the grouping heuristic identified and statistically distinct and not suitable for grouping with the others this initial rapid arrival of corrosion defects could be due to poor data recording adverse operational conditions e g outstanding exposure to heat miszczyk and darowicki 2001 or moisture morsch et al 2015 and or poor initial application of the coating itself tator and tator 2015 young ships with a paucity of corrosion defect reports benefit the most from the grouping heuristic fig 1 b shows that the defect arrival rate in the youngest ship ship h was placed into group 3 with 2 other ships in the fleet the statistical similarity of defect arrival rates in this group implies that each ship had similar coating performance in this compartment and they were treated as such by the model by grouping the model for a 14 year old ship ship h with other ships up to 21 years of age ship a pl nhpp parameters could be fit using defect reports for an older ship with similar coating performance thus model parameters for the arrival of corrosion defects in ship h could be informed by a larger number of reports from older ships allowing for more confident prediction of future defect arrivals the grouping heuristic was subsequently applied to all ship compartments that were suitable for modelling fig 2 illustrates the number of grouped compartments between pairs of ships i e the number of compartments with common model parameters as an example ships a and g have 33 39 compartments with statistically similar defect arrival models while ships g and f have quite different arrival characteristics this difference could be due to variations in the quality of the coating system or the operating conditions to which they were exposed dissimilar ship pairs warrant further investigation into the nature of these variations e g which ship tends to have higher arrival rates additional information pertaining to the operational conditions could further illuminate the origin of these dissimilarities in coating performance the quality of the predictions was assessed as follows the estimated parameters and the probability mass function eq 3 were used to compute the predicted 95 confidence interval for the test data i e last two years and the result is compared to the actual data this comparison is illustrated in fig 3 where the blue circles denote the test data points i e points not used for parameter estimation the solid red line is expected number of arrivals and the dashed black lines are the 95 confidence interval this procedure was performed for all ship compartment models in the fleet the training data is summarised in table 1 and the validation results are presented in table 2 all of the predicted confidence intervals contain more than 85 of the test data points over all of the compartments which is quite reasonable given that parameter uncertainty was neglected in this prediction the effects of grouping can be seen in table 2 both the individual and grouped fits provide a significant improvement over almost all of the single group i e one model fit to the entire fleet data models grouping results in an increased proportion of pl nhpp models compared with the individual fits but less than the single group fits since the arrival of corrosion defects is expected to increase as the protective coating degrades it is expected that pl nhpp is more appropriate and this is supported by the single group fit when the data is sufficient most compartments have pl nhpp models whereas the individual compartment models appear to have insufficient data to support the extra parameter in many cases however as noted above the individual models provide superior predictions compared to the single group fits left side of table 2 the grouped models are between these two extremes the grouping algorithm strategically aggregates the data to support the pl nhpp models expected from the physics of the process while also maintaining even slightly improving the prediction performance indeed the grouped fits performed slightly better than the individual fits across the fleet with the exception of ship g which yields a sizable improvement the validation results for ship g are a more extreme example of the advantage of considering fleetwide data when fitting defect arrival parameters individual fits give a high hpp selection rate and unusually poor performance in validation grouping statistically similar data from the rest of the fleet when modelling compartments in this ship resulted in improved validation performance and more frequent identification of an increasing defect arrival rate that would otherwise go undetected if only data from ship g is considered moreover using fleet data can enable modelling for compartments that would otherwise have insufficient historical records in such as case younger ships can inherit parameters that were estimated by fitting a single model to the entire fleet for the same compartment single group model for example the historical records for ship h contain 20 compartments for which sufficient data exists to conduct model parameter estimation since the last 2 years of this record were reserved for testing the training data was only adequate for modelling 13 of these 20 compartments predictions for the remaining 7 compartments were constructed using shared parameters for the other ships in the fleet i e a single group model is fit the resulting pl nhpp parameters were inherited by ship h and are shown in fig 4 the number of corrosion defects observed on a subsequent test inspection fell well within the prediction interval of the inherited model furthermore all test data in the 7 compartments fell within prediction interval of compartment models inherited by ship h single group partition parameter estimates can provide accurate predictions of corrosion defect arrivals for younger ships in a fleet while data is being collected to support more specific models 4 2 maintenance optimisation for a ship from fleet data in this section the inspection plan for a ship is optimised using methods described in section 3 the values for downtime costs associated with harbouring compartment access and various types of defect repairs are listed in table 3 which are based on conversations with hull maintainers and the organisation s internal documents the ship age was discretised into epochs of δ t 4 months and the parameters of the defect arrival model were estimated according to the methods discussed in section 3 and the inspection plan optimisation time horizon is set to t e o l t n o w 7 years the inspection plan was optimised over this time horizon using the methods in section 3 fig 5 shows pareto fronts for the simultaneous minimisation of the two objectives repair time and defects present for different values of the age constraint a the scheduling of additional inspection and maintenance actions where r 0 5 years exhibits a linear decrease in defects present when the total repair time exceeds 1 year additional actions produce diminishing reductions in the expected defects present indeed no amount of additional service time could reduce d below 68 due to the minimum time between inspections it can be seen that the defect age constraint only becomes active when w is sufficiently high emphasising minimisation of repair time and the inspection frequency needs to be increased to ensure satisfaction of the constraint the most extreme case of this effect can be seen in the magnified part of the pareto front in fig 5 which shows for the w 1 a 3 case the minimal r is achieved at a large increase in d the circled solution in the expansion of fig 5 is an example of an optimised plan for which the defect age constraint was active thus opportunities for further minimisation of d were not possible fig 6 presents historical and predicted defects appearing over the life of the ship with the application of some optimised plans for inspection and maintenance represented in fig 5 the time of the first possible inspection t n o w is marked with a vertical line inspection and repair events as blue points and 95 confidence intervals are presented as dotted lines defect arrivals between the most recent inspection in the historical record and the next possible inspection τ m 0 t n o w were computed using the estimated models therefore expected values for the defects present for the entire ship between 13 years of age and t n o w were composed from a combination of historical records and model predictions due to variation in τ m 0 in different compartments all optimised plans yielded immediate inspection at t n o w due to the large defect backlog for this particular ship it is also interesting to note that the optimal plans are sometimes periodic fig 6 a and 6 c and sometimes non periodic fig 6 b and 6 d interestingly for all optimised plans the longest inspection interval was reserved for the last interval resulting in the maximum number of defects occurring at t e o l this can be attributed to the retirement of the ship at the end of the horizon where defects no longer need to be repaired and thus incur no repair time costs this behaviour can be seen in fig 6 b where the non periodic inspection plan has a final inspection very soon after the second to last inspection in order to satisfy the age constraint while allowing the maximum number of defects to accumulate in the last interval 5 conclusion in this paper historical inspection data provided by the royal australian navy was used to fit arrival rates for corrosion defects onboard a fleet of frigates stochastic point process model fitting revealed that defect arrival rates increased as the vessels aged and this was attributed to the degradation of the protective coatings a novel grouping heuristic for model fitting and the identification of statistically similar ship compartments provided a balance between specificity and data availability when predicting the arrival of future defects the defect arrival rates predicted by these models performed well for all ships in the fleet models for younger ships inherited additional benefit from data collected on older ships enabling accurate short term prediction of arrival rates when such a prediction would otherwise be unfeasible a bi objective optimisation utilised the arrival models to plan future inspection and maintenance actions an appropriate compromise between a reduction in defects present and improved operational readiness was obtained without violating safety constraints the methodology presented here provides a practical and simple approach for maintainers to understand future degradation needs and plan inspection activities across the fleet this work presents three distinct opportunities for future investigation firstly the development of more flexible inspection policies where inspection and repair efforts are applied intelligently to compartments with more numerous defects secondly the defect arrival models can be combined with physical corrosion models to model the progression of defect severity which was neglected in the current work thirdly a better understanding of the coating degradation characteristics may motivate a more sophisticated approaches e g more general intensity functions besides the power law or condition

20206,a numerical simulation is proposed for the vortex induced vibration of a riser with two degrees of freedom the fluid structure interaction is determined using fluent fluid simulation software with the user defined function embedded giving the dynamic response and vortex shedding the reduced velocity ranges between 1 and 13 an adaptive fuzzy sliding mode controller based on simulink co simulation was innovatively applied to the active control of vortex induced vibration of the riser the dynamic responses and wake patterns before and after the active control in the lock in region were compared and analyzed and showed that extremely severe vibration of the riser occurred when the reduced velocity was 5 6 when the vortex shedding frequency was close to the natural frequency and when reached the lock in region after applying the control the vibration amplitude of the riser was suppressed with 95 efficiency in the cross flow direction and about 89 in the in line direction the adaptive fuzzy sliding mode controller demonstrated excellent control effects in both directions and is adaptable to the active control of vortex induced vibration under different disturbance mass stiffness and velocity conditions keywords riser fluid structure interaction vortex induced vibration active control adaptive fuzzy sliding mode theory collaborative simulation 1 introduction the working conditions of marine risers have become increasingly complicated with the gradual increase in the depth of oil and gas exploitation inside the riser are oil or gas at high temperature and pressure and the structure of the riser which is supported only at each end is subject to marine environmental loads such as waves and ocean currents vortex induced vibration viv is the main cause of fatigue damage to the riser brought about by the combined action of the internal and external loads damage to the riser results in huge economic losses serious marine pollution and ecological disaster wang et al 2020 a therefore the viv must be effectively controlled viv control strategies are divided into two categories flow control to suppress viv by changing the vortex shedding and structural vibration control which directly controls the structure to suppress viv a great deal of research has focused on viv suppression and various methods of passive and active control of vibration suppression technologies have been proposed liu et al 2020a at present passive control is the most widely applied in offshore engineering in which vibration suppression devices are added to the structure to change its surface shape or adding other devices to destroy the formation of the vortex and thus weaken the fluid oscillation forces suppressing viv and extending the fatigue life of the riser related methods are relatively mature rashidi et al 2016 comprising three approaches to control separation line and separated shear layer helical strakes axial strips wings hemispherical surfaces etc trim et al 2005 lu et al 2020 quen et al 2014 to affect the entrainment layer pipe sleeves control rods wire mesh etc wu et al 2012 huera huarte 2017 wang et al 2020 b or to control the wake streamers fairings separating plates etc lou et al 2016 of these fairings and helical strakes are the most widely applied however in practice they occupy an inordinate amount of space on the deck of the rig and require long installation times other devices for disturbing the control surface to disturb the wake suffer similar problems silva ortega and assi 2017 these approaches impose additional drag force on the structure and affect the amplitude only in the in line direction they have a relatively poor vibration suppression effect on flexible risers quen et al 2014 and increase the fatigue damage to risers in deep water moreover vibration suppression devices currently in use have limitations in complex marine environmental conditions and suffer from the attachment of marine plankton jadidi et al 2018 although passive vibration suppression devices are widely used in engineering practice these shortcomings may affect their performance in the long term compared with the passive control technologies active control of viv is limited by the technical means currently available and research and application are still in their infancy essentially the system dynamic stiffness damping and others are changed by inputting external energy and the vortex shedding or the structure s parameters are controlled to reduce the vibration amplitude and increase its service life active control methods are mainly in two forms liu et al 2020b boundary layer control methods electrical magnetic field thermal effect and rotation methods and wake control methods such as feedback control and secondary flow generation as examples a rotational feedback oscillation method has been proposed for actively suppressing the viv of a cylinder fujisawa and nakabayashi 2002 and computational fluid dynamics was adopted in a study of the effect of a free to rotate triangular fairing on suppressing viv and the vibrational response of the system zhu et al 2017 the results show that viv is suppressed within a certain range of reynolds number similarly an active control method of rotating a single control rod clockwise and counterclockwise was compared with the passive control effect of a fixed control rod shaharuddin and mat darus 2018 with results indicating that the active control was the better of the two an active flow control strategy of momentum injection muddada and patnaik 2017 used two small control rods positioned behind the 120 riser as actuators to damp vibrations by producing the required momentum other active vibration suppression methods include a water jetting device in the wake of the riser liu et al 2020b and an air jetting device in the incoming flow direction li et al 2020 were shown to have maximum vibration suppression efficiencies of 92 and 67 6 respectively with the emergence of fast digital processing technology and advanced actuators increasing attention is paid to studies of active control of viv methods such as rotation and fluid disturbances are economically challenging for risers subjected to complex loads in deep water yu and chen 2019 investigations of ways in which the fluid structure system may be changed by direct input of energy by a controller driven actuator has rapidly developed as far back as 1967 a feedback control method was introduced to control wake shedding for a cylinder in which negative feedback control effectively suppressed small scale vibrations berger 1967 in 1989 it was shown that acoustic excitation effectively weakens the wake vortex ffowcs williams and zhao 1989 a suboptimal feedback control method of local sensing and driving was proposed in 1999 to control the vortex behind a bluff body min and choi 1999 and the lift and drag coefficients of the bluff body were significantly reduced vortex shedding by a cylinder was influenced by embedding piezoelectric ceramic actuators on its surface cheng et al 2003 an open loop control algorithm chen et al 2005 and a closed loop control algorithm chen and aubry 2005 were developed to generate a local electromagnetic lorentz force by means of electrodes and magnets mounted on the body surface to control vortex shedding and boundary layer separation boundary control has been used to study the active vibration control of flexible risers under time varying distributed loads yu and chen 2019 in which the responses of open loop and closed loop systems were obtained the results show that the boundary has a significant effect on displacement and rotation angle an experimental investigation of the control performance of surface embedded piezoelectric actuator of two side by side cylinders has been conducted li et al 2007 a high frequency multi disturbance controller with feedback closed loop system has been developed for a square cylinder with elastic support wu et al 2007 based on semi implicit method for pressure linked equations solver an algorithm has been developed to simulate predict and control the vortex shedding of a cylinder within the subcritical reynolds number range re 100 to 300 muddada and patnaik 2010 the optimization dissipated energy of controller a practical application of viv in renewable energy production has also been analyzed meliga et al 2011 a study of the active control of the velocity feedback controller mehmood et al 2012 showed that the controller effectively suppresses the vibration in a cylinder a control system employing a fuzzy proportional integral derivative pid controller explored the flow induced vibrations fiv of two cylinders rabiee and esmaeili 2020 to study the extent of fiv reduction effect on the response amplitude of the two cylinders on each other as well as the vibration suppression in both cylinders simultaneously use of adaptive sliding mode control technology with a cylinder having low non dimensional mass and zero structural damping coefficients for re 90 in the laminar flow region hasheminejad et al 2014 other studies have shown that the transient performance of the sliding mode control strategy was enhanced for sliding mode control it has been proposed that a dynamic pseudo sliding mode control with a disturbance compensation term improves the otherwise poor robustness of traditional sliding mode control simulation of a two wheel self balancing trolley system indicated that the controller had a good anti interference performance meng et al 2012 the results of an adaptive fuzzy sliding mode controller developed as the input variable of the fuzzy system su 2012 showed effective improvement in the stability of the system compared to pid control in summary active control of viv in risers is still in its early days with the focus being on proposals for some form of external interference to disturb the fluid flow few studies have been on directly changing the forces in the structure itself to control its vibration the method theory and its potential suppression effect are bottlenecks in its development studies have shown that traditional sliding mode control has problems of high frequency chattering and instability no work in the existing literature has considered the effectiveness of sliding mode control to the riser coupled with two degrees of freedom in the high re region based on improved sliding mode control technology the study presents a way of actively controlling the viv from the aspect of the structural force and explores the effectiveness and robustness of such suppression in the lock in region of viv the remainder of this paper is arranged as follows sections 2 and 3 introduce the basic theory of numerical simulation of viv and the principle of sliding mode control in detail section 4 describes the problem and the numerical simulation process section 5 contains an analysis of the results of the active control on viv based on the adaptive fuzzy sliding mode theory the dynamic responses of the viv in the riser before the active control are analyzed first and then the frequency displacement and vibration suppression efficiency are discussed before and after vibration suppression during the lock in region section 6 summarizes some important conclusions 2 numerical methods 2 1 flow model the governing equations for the flow are the unsteady incompressible navier stokes equations the navier stokes equations are expressed as 1 ρ u i x i 0 i 1 2 3 2 ρ u i t ρ u i u j x j ρ f j p x i x i μ u i x j i 1 2 3 where ρ is the fluid density u i is the component of fluid velocity along the i axis μ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid f i is the mass force of the unit mass fluid and p is the pressure on the fluid microelement the governing equations are discretized using the element based finite volume method the turbulence model s s t k ω is adopted and the flow equations are given as 3 t ρ k x i ρ k u i x i γ k k x j g k y k s k 4 t ρ ω x j ρ ω u i x i γ ω ω x j g ω y ϖ d ω s ω where k and ω are the turbulent kinetic energy and specific dissipation rate respectively г g y and s represent their effective diffusivity production term dissipation term and source term respectively d is the cross diffusion term 2 2 structural model the numerical simulation of the riser viv is based on the slice method several planes are cut along the axis of the riser the cross sectional vibration of the riser is equivalent to an elastically supported mass spring damping system as shown in fig 1 considering the condition of the two degree of freedom viv of the elastically supported riser the vibration control equations are second order ordinary differential equations which are expressed as follows 5 m x t c x t k x t f d t 6 m y t c y t k y t f l t where m is the unit length mass of the riser k is the stiffness coefficient of the system c is the damping coefficient the natural frequency of the system is expressed as ω 0 2πf n f d t and f l t are the lift and drag forces in the in line il and cross flow cf directions respectively and y t x t y t x t and y t x t are the displacement velocity and acceleration of the moving riser in the cf and il direction respectively 2 3 fluid structure interaction the basic idea of the coupled algorithm is to simultaneously solve the momentum continuity energy and component transport equations and treat them as a set of vector or governing equations then the additional scalar governing equations are solved in order where the additional scalar equations are separated from each other and the coupled equations are also separated the governing equation in vector form is as follows pontaza and chen 2006 7 t v w d v f g d a v h d v where vector w ρ ρ u ρ v ρ w ρ e f ρ v ρ v u p i ˆ ρ v v p j ˆ ρ v w p k ˆ ρ v e p v g 0 τ x i τ y i τ z i τ i j v i q vector h contains source terms such as volume force and energy v is the velocity of the fluid ρ is the fluid density p is the pressure of the fluid q is the heat flux τ is the viscosity stress tensor and e is the energy of unit mass equations 5 and 6 are discretized and solved by the four step runge kutta method and the corresponding velocity and displacement in each time step are calculated then mesh update and the riser motion is controlled equation 6 is fully implicit and the function f v y can obtained 8 f v y f l t m 2 ζ ω 0 y t ω 0 2 y t velocities v t n 1 and displacement y t n 1 are obtained by discretization 9 v t n 1 v t n t 6 k 1 2 k 2 2 k 3 k 4 10 y t n 1 y t n t v t n t 2 6 k 1 k 2 k 3 where k 1 k 2 k 3 and k 4 are 11 k 1 f y t m 2 ζ ω 0 v t n ω 0 2 y t n 12 k 2 f y t m 2 ζ ω 0 v t n t 2 k 1 ω 0 2 y t n t 2 v t n 13 k 3 f y t m 2 ζ ω 0 v t n t 2 k 2 ω 0 2 y t n t 2 v t n t 2 4 k 1 14 k 4 f y t m 2 ζ ω 0 v t n t k 3 ω 0 2 y t n t v t n t 2 2 k 2 the initial conditions for the velocity and displacement are v t 0 v 0 and y t 0 y 0 the calculation process in the il direction can be deduced by analogy the simulation within each time step is initiated by solving the navier stokes equations in order to obtain the forces on the riser then the forces are transferred to the structural dynamic model to obtain the displacements of the riser the new mesh configuration is based on the displacements of the riser and the navier stokes equations are solved for the new mesh configuration such a fluid structure interaction loop is repeated during each time step of the simulation 3 controller design methods the sliding mode control system chen et al 2012 makes corresponding control at any time according to the changes of the current state so that the system moves according to the sliding modal trajectory which is the variable structure control the sliding mode controller is suitable for uncertain and nonlinear systems without the need to consider the parameters of the controlled object and the external interference however the disadvantage is that it cannot move 100 along the balance point of the sliding surface when the controlled object reaches the designed sliding surface but constantly crosses up and down on either side of the sliding surface resulting in so called buffeting 3 1 mathematical model the vibration of the riser is controlled by applying a cf control force thereby affecting the fluid structure interaction when viv occurs its cf vibration nonlinear mathematical model can be expressed as 15 m y c y k y f l f a where m is the unit length mass of the riser k is the stiffness coefficient of the system c is the damping coefficient y t y t and y t are the displacement velocity and acceleration of the moving riser in the cf direction f l is the lift force and f a is the force applied by the controller in the cf direction a single input and single output siso control is adopted si the force applied by the controller f a so the displacement y t the siso format is usually expressed as 16 x n f x t g x t u t d t where x n is the state of the controlled object displacement velocity acceleration etc u t is the control input d t is the interference term f x t and g x t are the polynomials related to the state of the controlled object equation 15 is expressed in the form of siso expression 16 below x x 1 t x 2 t y y t is selected as the state variable y t is the system output x 1 t and x 2 t are the displacement item and velocity item respectively which can be obtained as follows 17 y t x 1 t x 1 t x 2 t x 2 t f x t g x t u t d t where f x t c m y k m y c m x 2 t k m x 1 t g x t 1 u t f a m is the control force in the cf direction d t f l m is the vibration interference of the riser itself 3 2 design of the sliding mode surface considering the general situation there is a hypersurface i e switching surface s x t s x 1 x 2 x n 0 in the system state space which divides the state space into two parts s x t 0 and s x t 0 the switching surface is shown in fig 2 there are three kinds of motion on the hypersurface as follows 1 universal point the system passes through the hypersurface s x t 0 i e point a 2 starting point the system moves away from the hypersurface s x t 0 to both sides i e point b 3 ending point the system approaches the hypersurface s x t 0 from both sides i e point c 18 x f x u t x r n the points on the sliding mode switching surface must be motion points therefore when the motion points reach the vicinity of the switching surface there are 19 lim s 0 s x t s x t 0 in the actual situation the point satisfying the above formula lim s 0 s x t s x t 0 is just on the switching surface and the basic conditions for the existence of sliding mode motion are as follows 20 lim s 0 s x t s x t 0 the tracking error is defined as 21 e t y d t y t e t y d t y t where e t and e t are displacement term error and velocity term error respectively and y d t represents the expected cf displacement which is set as y d t 0 in this paper in order to make the sliding mode motion stable and have great quality sliding surface function is selected as 22 s x t c e t e t c y d t y t y d t y t c x 1 t x 2 t set s x t 0 and bring it into equation 22 s x t c x 1 t x 2 t can be obtained and bring them into equation 17 to get the control input 23 u t g x t 1 x 2 t f x t d t g x t 1 c x 1 t f x t d t 3 3 the fuzzy controller assuming that f x t g x t and d t are known eq 23 gives the control term as 24 u t g x t 1 c x 1 t f x t d t u t is difficult to obtain when f x t g x t and d t are unknown but it can be approximated by a fuzzy system u f z which is a single input system s t with fewer fuzzy rules the fuzzy rules are as follows rule i if s is f s i then u is α i where i 1 2 m and α i and f s i are fuzzy sets the output of the controller is given by 25 u f z s i 1 m ω i α i i 1 m ω i where ω i is the weight of the i th rule taking α i as an adjustable parameter then eq 25 becomes 26 u f z s α α t ξ where α α 1 α 2 α m t ξ ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ m t and ξ i is the normalized weight according to the approximation characteristics of the fuzzy system there is an optimal fuzzy system u f z s α to approximate the control term u t then 27 u t u f z s α ε α t ξ ε where ε is the approximation error which satisfies ε e t and e t is the robust control gain adopt u f z to approach u t then 28 u f z s α ˆ α t ξ where α ˆ is the estimated value of α the robust control u r b is used to compensate for the error between u and u f z the overall control is given by 29 u t u f z u r b according to eq 27 and the error between the control estimated value u ˆ f z and the real value u is defined as u f z 30 u f z u ˆ f z u u ˆ f z u f z ε the error between the fuzzy control gain estimated value α ˆ and the true value α of the adjustable parameters of fuzzy control is defined as α then formula 30 is 31 u f z α t ξ ε obtained by the eq 22 32 s t c x 1 t x 2 t according to eq 24 the control term is 33 u t g 1 x t f x t d t c x 1 t g 1 x t f x t d t c x 1 t x 2 t x 2 t g 1 x t f x t d t x 2 t s t g 1 x t g x t u t s t from eqs 29 and 33 we obtain 34 s t g x t u t u t g x t u t u f z u r b secondly the stability will be proved and the lyapunov function is defined as follows 35 v x t 1 2 s 2 x t g x t 2 η 1 α t α t where η 1 is the adaptive rule which is a positive real number 36 v x t s x t s x t g x t η 1 α t α s x t g x t u t u f z u r b g x t η 1 α t α s x t g x t u f z u r b g x t η 1 α t α s x t g x t α t ξ ε u r b g x t η 1 α t α g x t α t 1 η 1 α s x t ξ s x t g x t ε u r b the following adaptive rule and robust control are adopted to satisfy that v x t 0 37 α α ˆ η 1 s x t ξ 38 u r b e t sgn s x t where e t is the robust control gain then eq 36 becomes 39 v x t e t s x t g x t ε s x t g x t e t ε s x t g x t 0 in practical applications since it is difficult to determine the robust control gain e t its value is usually determined based on experience which is expressed as an estimated value e ˆ t and eq 38 is modified to 40 u r b e ˆ t sgn s x t the error between the estimated value e ˆ t and the true value of the robust control gain e is defined as e t 41 e t e ˆ t e the lyapunov function is defined as 42 v 1 x t v x t g x t 2 η 2 e 2 1 2 s 2 x t g x t 2 η 1 α t α g x t 2 η 2 e 2 where η 1 and η 2 are adaptive rule which are all positive real numbers 43 v 1 x t v x t g x t η 2 e e g x t α t s x t ξ 1 η 1 α s x t g x t ε u r b g x t η 2 e e e ˆ t s x t g x t ε s x t g x t g x t η 2 e ˆ t e e ˆ t in order to make v 1 x t 0 the adaptive rule of robust control item is defined as 44 e ˆ t η 2 s x t 45 v 1 x t e ˆ t s x t g x t ε s x t g x t e ˆ t e s x t g x t ε s x t g x t e t s x t g x t ε s x t g x t e t s x t g x t e ε s x t g x t 0 therefore the selected control rule satisfies the lyapunov stability requirements the gaussian membership function is selected in the paper three fuzzy rules for status variables are designed respectively and fuzzy processing is carried out on the input of fuzzy system the input membership function is shown in fig 3 similarly the sliding surface function parameter c 3 is selected and the adaptive rule parameters η 1 and η 2 are 2 5 and 2 5 respectively the initial values of adjustable parameters α ˆ is 0 2 0 0 2 and the initial estimated value of the robust control gain e ˆ is 50 the adaptive fuzzy sliding mode controller for the riser s viv is composed of a sliding mode surface a fuzzy controller a switching controller and so on the principle of the adaptive fuzzy sliding mode control system is shown in fig 4 with the amplitude of the riser y d t as the controlled object the expected y d t 0 as the control target the difference between the controlled object and the control target and its derivative as the tracking error to design sliding mode surface function s the mathematical models of the fuzzy controller and the robust controller are derived from the sliding mode surface function s and they are applied to the controlled object to form a completely closed loop system note that the state information fed back to the controller is the difference between the riser s amplitude and the expected amplitude at any time 4 problem descriptions and numerical solution 4 1 simulation parameters the diameter of the riser d 0 02 m the velocity inlet is 10d from the center of the riser and the distance between the borders on both sides is also 10d a relevant study prasanth et al 2006 has shown that the distance from the outlet to the center of the riser should be at least 20d to ensure that the vortex shedding behind the riser is not affected therefore the outlet was positioned at 30d behind the center of the riser the velocity inlet condition is chosen to be at the left hand boundary and the pressure outlet condition at the right hand boundary symmetrical boundary conditions are adopted at the upper and lower boundaries and a non slip wall condition is adopted at the surface of the riser the velocity range of 0 04 0 52 m s has been selected to analyze the viv response characteristics of the two degree of freedom riser the reduced velocity range is 1 13 and the reynold number ranges from 800 to 10400 which belongs to the subcritical reynolds number turbulence is defined by turbulence intensity and hydraulic diameter where the turbulence intensity is 5 7 the second order upwind discrete format is adopted and the fully implicit integration and the coupled algorithm are used the main parameters of the riser model are shown in table 1 structured quadrilateral grids were used to locally encrypt the computational domain in the form of the overset grid to enable better observation of the vortex shedding phenomenon the y value of the first boundary layer grid is 0 5 based on this it was estimated that the height of the first boundary layer is 0 00003 and its width is 1d the overall grid model is shown in fig 5 according to the requirement that the relative motion of the grid cannot exceed the minimum size of the overset an iterative time step of 0 01 s was selected for calculation finally the force on the riser and the wake vortex shedding characteristics are obtained 4 2 fluent matlab coupling the viv model of the two degrees of freedom riser was established using fluent and the adaptive fuzzy sliding mode controller model was constructed in matlab simulink the framework of the co simulation is shown in fig 6 5 results and discussions 5 1 model verification and dynamic response before vibration suppression the author verified the two dimensional urans modeling of the fixed riser at re 3900 as shown in table 2 the comparative analysis shows that the drag coefficient and strouhal number obtained by the simulation in this paper are in good agreement with the results in the references cui 2014 franke and frank 2002 yang and yuan 2015 norberg 1987 ong and wallace 1996 therefore the calculation results of the flow around the fixed riser and the two dimensional urans modeling are reliable which lays the foundation for the study of the two degree of freedom viv of the riser 5 1 1 frequency before vibration suppression fig 7 shows the power spectral density of variation displacement and vibration frequency versus reduced velocity before the control in order to intuitively reflect the relationship between frequency and reduced velocity the relationship of frequency ratio f s f n and reduced velocity vr curve is shown in fig 8 in which f s f n is the ratio between the vortex shedding frequency and the natural frequency of the riser the frequency ratio increases as vr increases at 1 vr 5 the frequency ratio remains stable the vortex shedding frequency of the riser is close to its natural frequency and the lock in region is reached at vr 5 6 then the frequency ratio continues to increase as the reduced velocity increases the slope of the line by linear fitting of the frequency ratio by the least squares method approximates to the strouhal number st of the riser within the velocity range its value is 0 205 which is similar to previous studies huera huarte and bearman 2009 gao et al 2015 the data contained in dongyang et al 2018 is shown in fig 8 and the findings are consistent with those from the reference this further verifies the reliability of the numerical model in the present work 5 1 2 displacement before vibration suppression fig 9 shows the displacements in the cf and il directions versus reduced velocity before applying the control the vibration amplitudes in both directions are small and weak when vr 5 the vibration is extremely severe and the amplitude in the cf direction suddenly increases to 0 59d at vr 5 6 at the same time the lock in region is reached which is consistent with the conclusion indicated by the frequency response as the flow velocity continues to increase the cf amplitude decreases to about 0 01d and the riser gradually departs from the lock in region when vr 7 the il amplitude of the riser increases with reduced velocity because the greater incoming flow velocity continues to shift the center point of the riser il vibration further from the origin in dongyang et al 2018 the viv of the riser was simulated at vr 3 7 comparison of those results in the cf direction with the present simulation results for viv in a two degree of freedom riser shows only small differences fig 9 which further verifies the correctness of the numerical simulation in the present study the motion of two degree of freedom is released and the vibration trajectory of the riser subjected to the coupling effect of fluid force presents a symmetrical 8 shape when the trajectories of the mass center of the riser are extracted as shown in fig 10 when vr 5 the amplitude in the cf direction is very small 0 02d when the riser is located in the lock in region at vr 5 6 the 8 deflection is changed and the vibration phases deviate in the cf and il directions that is the phase switching phenomenon occurs however when vr 6 the 8 shape gradually becomes smaller and a strong multi frequency vibration beat phenomenon occurs resulting in a chaotic trajectory it can be seen from the vibration trajectory that the il vibration amplitude is small at any reduced velocity therefore viv control measures in the cf direction as discussed below 5 1 3 vortex shedding before vibration suppression the pattern of vortex shedding is changed by the vibration of the riser the near wake vorticity in one cycle of the two degree of freedom riser t 40 40 5 s at vr 5 was selected for analysis and the wake vorticity of the riser is presented in fig 11 it should be noted that the color of red and blue in fig 11 represent the positive and negative vorticity in fluid field respectively it was found that within one cycle the wake area releases a pair of single vortices in opposite directions and the vortices merge in the far downstream which is the c 2s mode mella et al 2020 as the velocity increases the wake area formed by the vortex on the right hand side of the riser becomes longer and when the fluid leaves the boundary layer to form a vortex the velocity of the surrounding fluid increases driving it to move farther to the right 5 2 adaptive fuzzy sliding mode control for viv in the lock in region the amplitude of viv in the riser reaches about 0 59d in the lock in region and it vibrates intensely while the vibration distant from the lock in region is relatively weak therefore the case of vr 5 in the lock in region was selected to analyze the response characteristics before and after the control 5 2 1 analysis of frequency fig 12 shows the frequency responses of the two degree of freedom riser after applying control in the cf direction and comparison with the response before the control and for a fixed riser the fixed riser can be regarded as a stationary riser with zero displacements the closer the frequency after control is to the fixed riser the better the control effect fig 12 shows that the vortex shedding frequency of the fixed riser was 1 966 hz after the riser was controlled the frequency dropped from 2 053 to 2 002 hz and the strouhal number dropped from 0 205 to 0 200 5 2 2 analysis of the displacement and trajectory fig 13 shows the time histories of the amplitudes for the riser in the cf and il directions in addition to the associated control effort in fig 13 a the vibration response curve is approximately sinusoidal the riser vibrated with an amplitude of about 0 59d before the control was applied when its vibration frequency was close to the vortex shedding frequency the viv of the riser caused by ocean current attenuated sharply by about 95 from 0 59d to 0 03d after the control was applied to the cf force it is clear that the il vibration was also effectively controlled with an average amplitude decrease from 0 015d to 0 0095d and pulsation amplitude falling from 0 0018d to 0 0002d representing a suppression efficiency of about 89 fig 13 b shows that the maximum vibration displacement occurred when the controller was initially applied at which point the largest control force about 13 95 n was also exerted by the riser as the vibration gradually weakened the control force gradually fell until it was stable the control process of the adaptive fuzzy sliding mode controller was relatively smooth and the steady state accuracy was high the pre and post control trajectories of the center of mass of the riser are shown in fig 14 before control is applied the coupling vibration of the riser is normally a periodic 8 trajectory although the 8 shape is retained after the control is applied the cf and il amplitudes of the riser are smaller than before the vibration trajectory moves to the left due to the smaller average amplitude in the il direction controlling in the cf vibration also affects the il vibration the vibrations in both directions influence each other and the viv of the riser is a coupling vibration 5 2 3 analysis of the lift and drag coefficients the time history curves of the lift and drag coefficients for the riser before and after the control is applied are shown in fig 15 and for the fixed riser in fig 16 fig 15 shows that after the control is applied the drag coefficient gradually decreases and stabilizes at about 1 04 the lift coefficient increases until it becomes stable at an amplitude of 0 73 due to the inverse phase between the lift coefficient and the displacement amplitude within the reduced velocity range comparing these with the lift and drag coefficients for the fixed riser in fig 16 it is found that the lift and drag coefficients of the two degree of freedom riser tend to be in the state as the fixed riser but there is a little difference the main reason is that the viv of the riser is coupled vibration and its il vibration changes the flow field and affects its cf vibration so that the cf vibration of the fixed riser cannot be completely controlled fig 17 shows the phase trajectories of the lift and drag coefficients relative to the cf and il dimensionless amplitude responses before and after the cf control quantitatively revealing the dynamic characteristics of fluid structure interaction in fig 17 a the phase of lift coefficient and cf vibration displacement is located in the second and fourth quadrants and before the control is applied the lift coefficient is least when displacement is greatest this indicates that the cf vibration displacement of the riser is in inverse phase with the lift force as had previously been noted in the paper raza et al 2020 when the control is applied the interaction between the fluid and the structure changes greatly and the phase trajectory rotates counterclockwise and changes approximately on the y axis the displacement of the riser during cf vibration differs at 90 from the lift coefficient mainly because the application of the control alters the nature of the riser fluid interaction and results in the jump in phase difference the cf vibration displacement is effectively controlled and the amplitude drops from 0 59d to 0 03d in fig 17 b it can be seen that the vibration displacement of the riser in the il direction is in an inverse phase with the drag coefficient initially and remains out of phase after the control is applied this is because the mass ratio selected for the riser was relatively high and its vibration in the il direction was therefore not excessively violent moreover there is no il phase difference before and after application of the control since the il vibration is not controlled directly 5 2 4 analysis of vortex shedding fig 18 a g show the wake vorticity of the riser after the control is applied and fig 18 h n and fig 18 o u show the vibration amplitudes in the cf and il directions at different times the vibration of the riser is effectively controlled and the wake vortex shedding mode is changed from the c 2s mode to the 2s mode and similar phenomena was found by hasheminejad et al 2014 too at the early stage of the control process t 4 94 46 56s the near wake structure exhibits alternate shedding of vortices which appear in the form of coalescence in the far wake area which is defined as a c mode vortex coalescence which is a characteristic of the c 2s mode of high intensity vortex shedding williamson and roshko 1988 comparing the wake vorticity with the displacement amplitude it is found that the shape of the vortex shedding in the wake of the riser lags behind the displacement at t 46 56 s the displacements are greatly reduced fig 18 m 18 t and very stable in the cf direction but at this moment the wake vortex shows little change from the state before the control was applied and the wake vortex is still in the c 2s mode fig 18 f after the control force is applied to make the displacement amplitudes in the two directions reach stable states until t 55 s the wake vortex becomes the classic 2s kármán vortex street fig 18 g at this time the vortex shedding frequency and vortex shape of the riser are very similar to the flow around the fixed riser the hysteresis of riser vortex shedding and displacement change is mainly restricted by the delay of the stable displacement amplitude in the il direction 5 3 verification on robustness of the controller in order to verify the accuracy of the physical model of fluid structure interaction in this study and especially to demonstrate the excellent robustness of the adaptive fuzzy sliding mode controller and its effect on viv the disturbance the qualities stiffnesses and incoming flow velocities were modified and the control effect of the controller under different working conditions was analyzed firstly the designed adaptive fuzzy sliding mode controller is used to simulate when the initial value of the riser amplitude is 0 011m with the large disturbance f l 3 sin 12 9 t and small disturbance f l 0 5 c l ρ u 2 d sin ω t 0 205 sin 12 9 t and compared the control effect with the conventional quasi sliding mode control as shown in fig 19 and 20 the results show that the adaptive fuzzy sliding mode controller designed in this paper has better robustness compared with the quasi sliding mode control with saturated function when the external disturbance is large the steady state error caused by the adaptive fuzzy sliding mode controller is smaller when the control input is similar similarly when the external interference is less the desired trajectory can be reached faster and the performance of the controller is obviously better than the conventional quasi sliding mode control the riser mass and stiffness were modified by 20 above and below the original values fig 21 a b c and d respectively show the time history curves of the dimensionless displacement before and after applying control to risers of different mass and stiffness the natural frequency of the riser remains at 2 0 hz and the riser is still in the lock in region due to the synchronous change of the quality and stiffness of the riser it is clear in fig 21 that small changes of model parameter values cause large changes in the amplitude response of the riser when the mass stiffness of the riser increases by 20 the cf vibration takes longer to stabilize than the other two risers under the action of the current conversely when the mass and stiffness are reduced synchronously the system reaches stability more rapidly but the maximum amplitude is the same in the three cases when the mass stiffness of the riser is increased by 20 its average il displacement is about 0 012d which is less than for a mass stiffness reduction of 20 0 019d and the mass stiffness of the riser is unchanged 0 015d this is mainly due to the larger mass ratio and the weaker impact of the current on the riser making it nearer its original position furthermore the robustness of the active controller was verified when the effect of changing the velocities was investigated an of initial current velocity vr 5 5 was selected to ensure that the riser would be in the lock in region and the amplitude response of the riser was analyzed after a velocity change of 10 the time history curves of the dimensionless displacement before and after controlling the riser at different current velocities are shown in fig 22 before applying the control the time for its amplitude to stabilize increased with rising inlet velocity in the cf direction for example when the flow velocity increased by 10 the cf and il amplitudes of the riser were not stable but were still increasing after 45 s similarly the increase of flow velocity raised average amplitude of the riser in the il direction and the vibration balance position of the riser increased above the initial position after the control is applied the amplitudes in the cf and il directions of the riser were effectively controlled under different working conditions the controller has outstanding robustness for example when the current velocity was reduced by 10 the maximum amplitude of the riser decreased from about 0 530d to 0 025d and the vibration suppression efficiency was about 95 3 6 conclusions the viv of the two degrees of freedom riser was attained using fluent software combined with the user defined function the adaptive fuzzy sliding mode controller model for the viv of the riser was established in the study a collaborative simulation platform was built to simulate and analyze active control technology for viv in the lock in region of the riser the conclusions are as follows 1 the vibration of the two degree of freedom riser in the cf direction was more severe than that in the il direction it is in the lock in region at vr 5 6 the average amplitude in the il direction increased with the reduced velocity and the vibration in the cf direction of the riser was relatively weak outside that region with an amplitude less than 0 02d and the wake vortex was of the c 2s pattern 2 the proposed adaptive fuzzy sliding mode controller produced an outstanding control effect in the lock in region after the control was applied the cf and il amplitudes were attenuated greatly and the viv of the riser was effectively controlled the vibration suppression efficiencies were about 95 in the cf direction and about 89 in the il direction 3 the viv of the riser is an example of coupled vibration and affects the vibration in the il direction while controlling the cf vibration compared with the displacement variation vortex shedding was delayed in the wake of the riser after a period of control the wake behind the riser gradually approached the flow around the fixed riser and was of the 2s pattern 4 control effect and robustness of the adaptive fuzzy sliding mode controller is obviously better than that of the conventional quasi sliding mode control when the mass and stiffness were increased simultaneously or the velocity increased while the riser was in the lock in region the maximum amplitude of the riser barely changed but stabilization time was prolonged the proposed adaptive fuzzy sliding mode controller suppressed the viv of the riser well under different working conditions and is very adaptable and

20206,a numerical simulation is proposed for the vortex induced vibration of a riser with two degrees of freedom the fluid structure interaction is determined using fluent fluid simulation software with the user defined function embedded giving the dynamic response and vortex shedding the reduced velocity ranges between 1 and 13 an adaptive fuzzy sliding mode controller based on simulink co simulation was innovatively applied to the active control of vortex induced vibration of the riser the dynamic responses and wake patterns before and after the active control in the lock in region were compared and analyzed and showed that extremely severe vibration of the riser occurred when the reduced velocity was 5 6 when the vortex shedding frequency was close to the natural frequency and when reached the lock in region after applying the control the vibration amplitude of the riser was suppressed with 95 efficiency in the cross flow direction and about 89 in the in line direction the adaptive fuzzy sliding mode controller demonstrated excellent control effects in both directions and is adaptable to the active control of vortex induced vibration under different disturbance mass stiffness and velocity conditions keywords riser fluid structure interaction vortex induced vibration active control adaptive fuzzy sliding mode theory collaborative simulation 1 introduction the working conditions of marine risers have become increasingly complicated with the gradual increase in the depth of oil and gas exploitation inside the riser are oil or gas at high temperature and pressure and the structure of the riser which is supported only at each end is subject to marine environmental loads such as waves and ocean currents vortex induced vibration viv is the main cause of fatigue damage to the riser brought about by the combined action of the internal and external loads damage to the riser results in huge economic losses serious marine pollution and ecological disaster wang et al 2020 a therefore the viv must be effectively controlled viv control strategies are divided into two categories flow control to suppress viv by changing the vortex shedding and structural vibration control which directly controls the structure to suppress viv a great deal of research has focused on viv suppression and various methods of passive and active control of vibration suppression technologies have been proposed liu et al 2020a at present passive control is the most widely applied in offshore engineering in which vibration suppression devices are added to the structure to change its surface shape or adding other devices to destroy the formation of the vortex and thus weaken the fluid oscillation forces suppressing viv and extending the fatigue life of the riser related methods are relatively mature rashidi et al 2016 comprising three approaches to control separation line and separated shear layer helical strakes axial strips wings hemispherical surfaces etc trim et al 2005 lu et al 2020 quen et al 2014 to affect the entrainment layer pipe sleeves control rods wire mesh etc wu et al 2012 huera huarte 2017 wang et al 2020 b or to control the wake streamers fairings separating plates etc lou et al 2016 of these fairings and helical strakes are the most widely applied however in practice they occupy an inordinate amount of space on the deck of the rig and require long installation times other devices for disturbing the control surface to disturb the wake suffer similar problems silva ortega and assi 2017 these approaches impose additional drag force on the structure and affect the amplitude only in the in line direction they have a relatively poor vibration suppression effect on flexible risers quen et al 2014 and increase the fatigue damage to risers in deep water moreover vibration suppression devices currently in use have limitations in complex marine environmental conditions and suffer from the attachment of marine plankton jadidi et al 2018 although passive vibration suppression devices are widely used in engineering practice these shortcomings may affect their performance in the long term compared with the passive control technologies active control of viv is limited by the technical means currently available and research and application are still in their infancy essentially the system dynamic stiffness damping and others are changed by inputting external energy and the vortex shedding or the structure s parameters are controlled to reduce the vibration amplitude and increase its service life active control methods are mainly in two forms liu et al 2020b boundary layer control methods electrical magnetic field thermal effect and rotation methods and wake control methods such as feedback control and secondary flow generation as examples a rotational feedback oscillation method has been proposed for actively suppressing the viv of a cylinder fujisawa and nakabayashi 2002 and computational fluid dynamics was adopted in a study of the effect of a free to rotate triangular fairing on suppressing viv and the vibrational response of the system zhu et al 2017 the results show that viv is suppressed within a certain range of reynolds number similarly an active control method of rotating a single control rod clockwise and counterclockwise was compared with the passive control effect of a fixed control rod shaharuddin and mat darus 2018 with results indicating that the active control was the better of the two an active flow control strategy of momentum injection muddada and patnaik 2017 used two small control rods positioned behind the 120 riser as actuators to damp vibrations by producing the required momentum other active vibration suppression methods include a water jetting device in the wake of the riser liu et al 2020b and an air jetting device in the incoming flow direction li et al 2020 were shown to have maximum vibration suppression efficiencies of 92 and 67 6 respectively with the emergence of fast digital processing technology and advanced actuators increasing attention is paid to studies of active control of viv methods such as rotation and fluid disturbances are economically challenging for risers subjected to complex loads in deep water yu and chen 2019 investigations of ways in which the fluid structure system may be changed by direct input of energy by a controller driven actuator has rapidly developed as far back as 1967 a feedback control method was introduced to control wake shedding for a cylinder in which negative feedback control effectively suppressed small scale vibrations berger 1967 in 1989 it was shown that acoustic excitation effectively weakens the wake vortex ffowcs williams and zhao 1989 a suboptimal feedback control method of local sensing and driving was proposed in 1999 to control the vortex behind a bluff body min and choi 1999 and the lift and drag coefficients of the bluff body were significantly reduced vortex shedding by a cylinder was influenced by embedding piezoelectric ceramic actuators on its surface cheng et al 2003 an open loop control algorithm chen et al 2005 and a closed loop control algorithm chen and aubry 2005 were developed to generate a local electromagnetic lorentz force by means of electrodes and magnets mounted on the body surface to control vortex shedding and boundary layer separation boundary control has been used to study the active vibration control of flexible risers under time varying distributed loads yu and chen 2019 in which the responses of open loop and closed loop systems were obtained the results show that the boundary has a significant effect on displacement and rotation angle an experimental investigation of the control performance of surface embedded piezoelectric actuator of two side by side cylinders has been conducted li et al 2007 a high frequency multi disturbance controller with feedback closed loop system has been developed for a square cylinder with elastic support wu et al 2007 based on semi implicit method for pressure linked equations solver an algorithm has been developed to simulate predict and control the vortex shedding of a cylinder within the subcritical reynolds number range re 100 to 300 muddada and patnaik 2010 the optimization dissipated energy of controller a practical application of viv in renewable energy production has also been analyzed meliga et al 2011 a study of the active control of the velocity feedback controller mehmood et al 2012 showed that the controller effectively suppresses the vibration in a cylinder a control system employing a fuzzy proportional integral derivative pid controller explored the flow induced vibrations fiv of two cylinders rabiee and esmaeili 2020 to study the extent of fiv reduction effect on the response amplitude of the two cylinders on each other as well as the vibration suppression in both cylinders simultaneously use of adaptive sliding mode control technology with a cylinder having low non dimensional mass and zero structural damping coefficients for re 90 in the laminar flow region hasheminejad et al 2014 other studies have shown that the transient performance of the sliding mode control strategy was enhanced for sliding mode control it has been proposed that a dynamic pseudo sliding mode control with a disturbance compensation term improves the otherwise poor robustness of traditional sliding mode control simulation of a two wheel self balancing trolley system indicated that the controller had a good anti interference performance meng et al 2012 the results of an adaptive fuzzy sliding mode controller developed as the input variable of the fuzzy system su 2012 showed effective improvement in the stability of the system compared to pid control in summary active control of viv in risers is still in its early days with the focus being on proposals for some form of external interference to disturb the fluid flow few studies have been on directly changing the forces in the structure itself to control its vibration the method theory and its potential suppression effect are bottlenecks in its development studies have shown that traditional sliding mode control has problems of high frequency chattering and instability no work in the existing literature has considered the effectiveness of sliding mode control to the riser coupled with two degrees of freedom in the high re region based on improved sliding mode control technology the study presents a way of actively controlling the viv from the aspect of the structural force and explores the effectiveness and robustness of such suppression in the lock in region of viv the remainder of this paper is arranged as follows sections 2 and 3 introduce the basic theory of numerical simulation of viv and the principle of sliding mode control in detail section 4 describes the problem and the numerical simulation process section 5 contains an analysis of the results of the active control on viv based on the adaptive fuzzy sliding mode theory the dynamic responses of the viv in the riser before the active control are analyzed first and then the frequency displacement and vibration suppression efficiency are discussed before and after vibration suppression during the lock in region section 6 summarizes some important conclusions 2 numerical methods 2 1 flow model the governing equations for the flow are the unsteady incompressible navier stokes equations the navier stokes equations are expressed as 1 ρ u i x i 0 i 1 2 3 2 ρ u i t ρ u i u j x j ρ f j p x i x i μ u i x j i 1 2 3 where ρ is the fluid density u i is the component of fluid velocity along the i axis μ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid f i is the mass force of the unit mass fluid and p is the pressure on the fluid microelement the governing equations are discretized using the element based finite volume method the turbulence model s s t k ω is adopted and the flow equations are given as 3 t ρ k x i ρ k u i x i γ k k x j g k y k s k 4 t ρ ω x j ρ ω u i x i γ ω ω x j g ω y ϖ d ω s ω where k and ω are the turbulent kinetic energy and specific dissipation rate respectively г g y and s represent their effective diffusivity production term dissipation term and source term respectively d is the cross diffusion term 2 2 structural model the numerical simulation of the riser viv is based on the slice method several planes are cut along the axis of the riser the cross sectional vibration of the riser is equivalent to an elastically supported mass spring damping system as shown in fig 1 considering the condition of the two degree of freedom viv of the elastically supported riser the vibration control equations are second order ordinary differential equations which are expressed as follows 5 m x t c x t k x t f d t 6 m y t c y t k y t f l t where m is the unit length mass of the riser k is the stiffness coefficient of the system c is the damping coefficient the natural frequency of the system is expressed as ω 0 2πf n f d t and f l t are the lift and drag forces in the in line il and cross flow cf directions respectively and y t x t y t x t and y t x t are the displacement velocity and acceleration of the moving riser in the cf and il direction respectively 2 3 fluid structure interaction the basic idea of the coupled algorithm is to simultaneously solve the momentum continuity energy and component transport equations and treat them as a set of vector or governing equations then the additional scalar governing equations are solved in order where the additional scalar equations are separated from each other and the coupled equations are also separated the governing equation in vector form is as follows pontaza and chen 2006 7 t v w d v f g d a v h d v where vector w ρ ρ u ρ v ρ w ρ e f ρ v ρ v u p i ˆ ρ v v p j ˆ ρ v w p k ˆ ρ v e p v g 0 τ x i τ y i τ z i τ i j v i q vector h contains source terms such as volume force and energy v is the velocity of the fluid ρ is the fluid density p is the pressure of the fluid q is the heat flux τ is the viscosity stress tensor and e is the energy of unit mass equations 5 and 6 are discretized and solved by the four step runge kutta method and the corresponding velocity and displacement in each time step are calculated then mesh update and the riser motion is controlled equation 6 is fully implicit and the function f v y can obtained 8 f v y f l t m 2 ζ ω 0 y t ω 0 2 y t velocities v t n 1 and displacement y t n 1 are obtained by discretization 9 v t n 1 v t n t 6 k 1 2 k 2 2 k 3 k 4 10 y t n 1 y t n t v t n t 2 6 k 1 k 2 k 3 where k 1 k 2 k 3 and k 4 are 11 k 1 f y t m 2 ζ ω 0 v t n ω 0 2 y t n 12 k 2 f y t m 2 ζ ω 0 v t n t

velocity and displacement are v t 0 v 0 and y t 0 y 0 the calculation process in the il direction can be deduced by analogy the simulation within each time step is initiated by solving the navier stokes equations in order to obtain the forces on the riser then the forces are transferred to the structural dynamic model to obtain the displacements of the riser the new mesh configuration is based on the displacements of the riser and the navier stokes equations are solved for the new mesh configuration such a fluid structure interaction loop is repeated during each time step of the simulation 3 controller design methods the sliding mode control system chen et al 2012 makes corresponding control at any time according to the changes of the current state so that the system moves according to the sliding modal trajectory which is the variable structure control the sliding mode controller is suitable for uncertain and nonlinear systems without the need to consider the parameters of the controlled object and the external interference however the disadvantage is that it cannot move 100 along the balance point of the sliding surface when the controlled object reaches the designed sliding surface but constantly crosses up and down on either side of the sliding surface resulting in so called buffeting 3 1 mathematical model the vibration of the riser is controlled by applying a cf control force thereby affecting the fluid structure interaction when viv occurs its cf vibration nonlinear mathematical model can be expressed as 15 m y c y k y f l f a where m is the unit length mass of the riser k is the stiffness coefficient of the system c is the damping coefficient y t y t and y t are the displacement velocity and acceleration of the moving riser in the cf direction f l is the lift force and f a is the force applied by the controller in the cf direction a single input and single output siso control is adopted si the force applied by the controller f a so the displacement y t the siso format is usually expressed as 16 x n f x t g x t u t d t where x n is the state of the controlled object displacement velocity acceleration etc u t is the control input d t is the interference term f x t and g x t are the polynomials related to the state of the controlled object equation 15 is expressed in the form of siso expression 16 below x x 1 t x 2 t y y t is selected as the state variable y t is the system output x 1 t and x 2 t are the displacement item and velocity item respectively which can be obtained as follows 17 y t x 1 t x 1 t x 2 t x 2 t f x t g x t u t d t where f x t c m y k m y c m x 2 t k m x 1 t g x t 1 u t f a m is the control force in the cf direction d t f l m is the vibration interference of the riser itself 3 2 design of the sliding mode surface considering the general situation there is a hypersurface i e switching surface s x t s x 1 x 2 x n 0 in the system state space which divides the state space into two parts s x t 0 and s x t 0 the switching surface is shown in fig 2 there are three kinds of motion on the hypersurface as follows 1 universal point the system passes through the hypersurface s x t 0 i e point a 2 starting point the system moves away from the hypersurface s x t 0 to both sides i e point b 3 ending point the system approaches the hypersurface s x t 0 from both sides i e point c 18 x f x u t x r n the points on the sliding mode switching surface must be motion points therefore when the motion points reach the vicinity of the switching surface there are 19 lim s 0 s x t s x t 0 in the actual situation the point satisfying the above formula lim s 0 s x t s x t 0 is just on the switching surface and the basic conditions for the existence of sliding mode motion are as follows 20 lim s 0 s x t s x t 0 the tracking error is defined as 21 e t y d t y t e t y d t y t where e t and e t are displacement term error and velocity term error respectively and y d t represents the expected cf displacement which is set as y d t 0 in this paper in order to make the sliding mode motion stable and have great quality sliding surface function is selected as 22 s x t c e t e t c y d t y t y d t y

unknown but it can be approximated by a fuzzy system u f z which is a single input system s t with fewer fuzzy rules the fuzzy rules are as follows rule i if s is f s i then u is α i where i 1 2 m and α i and f s i are fuzzy sets the output of the controller is given by 25 u f z s i 1 m ω i α i i 1 m ω i where ω i is the weight of the i th rule taking α i as an adjustable parameter then eq 25 becomes 26 u f z s α α t ξ where α α 1 α 2 α m t ξ ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ m t and ξ i is the normalized weight according to the approximation characteristics of the fuzzy system there is an optimal fuzzy system u

28 u f z s α ˆ α t ξ where α ˆ is the estimated value of α the robust control u r b is used to compensate for the error between u and u f z the overall control is given by 29 u t u f z u r b according

secondly the stability will be proved and the lyapunov function is defined as follows 35 v x t 1 2 s 2 x t g x t 2 η 1 α t α t where η 1 is the adaptive rule which is a positive real number 36 v x t s

the following adaptive rule and robust control are adopted to satisfy that v x t 0 37 α α ˆ η 1 s x t ξ 38 u r b e t sgn s x t where e t is the robust control gain then eq 36 becomes 39 v x t e t s x

expressed as an estimated value e ˆ t and eq 38 is modified to 40 u r b e ˆ t sgn s x t the error between the estimated value e ˆ t and the true value of the robust control gain e is defined as e t 41 e t e ˆ t e the lyapunov function is defined as 42 v 1 x t v x t g x t 2 η 2 e 2 1 2 s 2 x t g x t 2 η 1 α t α g x t 2 η 2 e 2 where η 1 and η 2 are adaptive rule which are all positive real numbers

therefore the selected control rule satisfies the lyapunov stability requirements the gaussian membership function is selected in the paper three fuzzy rules for status variables are designed respectively and fuzzy processing is carried out on the input of fuzzy system the input membership function is shown in fig 3 similarly the sliding surface function parameter c 3 is selected and the adaptive rule parameters η 1 and η 2 are 2 5 and 2 5 respectively the initial values of adjustable parameters α ˆ is 0 2 0 0 2 and the initial estimated value of the robust control gain e ˆ is 50 the adaptive fuzzy sliding mode controller for the riser s viv is composed of a sliding mode surface a fuzzy controller a switching controller and so on the principle of the adaptive fuzzy sliding mode control system is shown in fig 4 with the amplitude of the riser y d t as the controlled object the expected y d t 0 as the control target the difference between the controlled object and the control target and its derivative as the tracking error to design sliding mode surface function s the mathematical models of the fuzzy controller and the robust controller are derived from the sliding mode surface function s and they are applied to the controlled object to form a completely closed loop system note that the state information fed back to the controller is the difference between the riser s amplitude and the expected amplitude at any time 4 problem descriptions and numerical solution 4 1 simulation parameters the diameter of the riser d 0 02 m the velocity inlet is 10d from the center of the riser and the distance between the borders on both sides is also 10d a relevant study prasanth et al 2006 has shown that the distance from the outlet to the center of the riser should be at least 20d to ensure that the vortex shedding behind the riser is not affected therefore the outlet was positioned at 30d behind the center of the riser the velocity inlet condition is chosen to be at the left hand boundary and the pressure outlet condition at the right hand boundary symmetrical boundary conditions are adopted at the upper and lower boundaries and a non slip wall condition is adopted at the surface of the riser the velocity range of 0 04 0 52 m s has been selected to analyze the viv response characteristics of the two degree of freedom riser the reduced velocity range is 1 13 and the reynold number ranges from 800 to 10400 which belongs to the subcritical reynolds number turbulence is defined by turbulence intensity and hydraulic diameter where the turbulence intensity is 5 7 the second order upwind discrete format is adopted and the fully implicit integration and the coupled algorithm are used the main parameters of the riser model are shown in table 1 structured quadrilateral grids were used to locally encrypt the computational domain in the form of the overset grid to enable better observation of the vortex shedding phenomenon the y value of the first boundary layer grid is 0 5 based on this it was estimated that the height of the first boundary layer is 0 00003 and its width is 1d the overall grid model is shown in fig 5 according to the requirement that the relative motion of the grid cannot exceed the minimum size of the overset an iterative time step of 0 01 s was selected for calculation finally the force on the riser and the wake vortex shedding characteristics are obtained 4 2 fluent matlab coupling the viv model of the two degrees of freedom riser was established using fluent and the adaptive fuzzy sliding mode controller model was constructed in matlab simulink the framework of the co simulation is shown in fig 6 5 results and discussions 5 1 model verification and dynamic response before vibration suppression the author verified the two dimensional urans modeling of the fixed riser at re 3900 as shown in table 2 the comparative analysis shows that the drag coefficient and strouhal number obtained by the simulation in this paper are in good agreement with the results in the references cui 2014 franke and frank 2002 yang and yuan 2015 norberg 1987 ong and wallace 1996 therefore the calculation results of the flow around the fixed riser and the two dimensional urans modeling are reliable which lays the foundation for the study of the two degree of freedom viv of the riser 5 1 1 frequency before vibration suppression fig 7 shows the power spectral density of variation displacement and vibration frequency versus reduced velocity before the control in order to intuitively reflect the relationship between frequency and reduced velocity the relationship of frequency ratio f s f n and reduced velocity vr curve is shown in fig 8 in which f s f n is the ratio between the vortex shedding frequency and the natural frequency of the riser the frequency ratio increases as vr increases at 1 vr 5 the frequency ratio remains stable the vortex shedding frequency of the riser is close to its natural frequency and the lock in region is reached at vr 5 6 then the frequency ratio continues to increase as the reduced velocity increases the slope of the line by linear fitting of the frequency ratio by the least squares method approximates to the strouhal number st of the riser within the velocity range its value is 0 205 which is similar to previous studies huera huarte and bearman 2009 gao et al 2015 the data contained in dongyang et al 2018 is shown in fig 8 and the findings are consistent with those from the reference this further verifies the reliability of the numerical model in the present work 5 1 2 displacement before vibration suppression fig 9 shows the displacements in the cf and il directions versus reduced velocity before applying the control the vibration amplitudes in both directions are small and weak when vr 5 the vibration is extremely severe and the amplitude in the cf direction suddenly increases to 0 59d at vr 5 6 at the same time the lock in region is reached which is consistent with the conclusion indicated by the frequency response as the flow velocity continues to increase the cf amplitude decreases to about 0 01d and the riser gradually departs from the lock in region when vr 7 the il amplitude of the riser increases with reduced velocity because the greater incoming flow velocity continues to shift the center point of the riser il vibration further from the origin in dongyang et al 2018 the viv of the riser was simulated at vr 3 7 comparison of those results in the cf direction with the present simulation results for viv in a two degree of freedom riser shows only small differences fig 9 which further verifies the correctness of the numerical simulation in the present study the motion of two degree of freedom is released and the vibration trajectory of the riser subjected to the coupling effect of fluid force presents a symmetrical 8 shape when the trajectories of the mass center of the riser are extracted as shown in fig 10 when vr 5 the amplitude in the cf direction is very small 0 02d when the riser is located in the lock in region at vr 5 6 the 8 deflection is changed and the vibration phases deviate in the cf and il directions that is the phase switching phenomenon occurs however when vr 6 the 8 shape gradually becomes smaller and a strong multi frequency vibration beat phenomenon occurs resulting in a chaotic trajectory it can be seen from the vibration trajectory that the il vibration amplitude is small at any reduced velocity therefore viv control measures in the cf direction as discussed below 5 1 3 vortex shedding before vibration suppression the pattern of vortex shedding is changed by the vibration of the riser the near wake vorticity in one cycle of the two degree of freedom riser t 40 40 5 s at vr 5 was selected for analysis and the wake vorticity of the riser is presented in fig 11 it should be noted that the color of red and blue in fig 11 represent the positive and negative vorticity in fluid field respectively it was found that within one cycle the wake area releases a pair of single vortices in opposite directions and the vortices merge in the far downstream which is the c 2s mode mella et al 2020 as the velocity increases the wake area formed by the vortex on the right hand side of the riser becomes longer and when the fluid leaves the boundary layer to form a vortex the velocity of the surrounding fluid increases driving it to move farther to the right 5 2 adaptive fuzzy sliding mode control for viv in the lock in region the amplitude of viv in the riser reaches about 0 59d in the lock in region and it vibrates intensely while the vibration distant from the lock in region is relatively weak therefore the case of vr 5 in the lock in region was selected to analyze the response characteristics before and after the control 5 2 1 analysis of frequency fig 12 shows the frequency responses of the two degree of freedom riser after applying control in the cf direction and comparison with the response before the control and for a fixed riser the fixed riser can be regarded as a stationary riser with zero displacements the closer the frequency after control is to the fixed riser the better the control effect fig 12 shows that the vortex shedding frequency of the fixed riser was 1 966 hz after the riser was controlled the frequency dropped from 2 053 to 2 002 hz and the strouhal number dropped from 0 205 to 0 200 5 2 2 analysis of the displacement and trajectory fig 13 shows the time histories of the amplitudes for the riser in the cf and il directions in addition to the associated control effort in fig 13 a the vibration response curve is approximately sinusoidal the riser vibrated with an amplitude of about 0 59d before the control was applied when its vibration frequency was close to the vortex shedding frequency the viv of the riser caused by ocean current attenuated sharply by about 95 from 0 59d to 0 03d after the control was applied to the cf force it is clear that the il vibration was also effectively controlled with an average amplitude decrease from 0 015d to 0 0095d and pulsation amplitude falling from 0 0018d to 0 0002d representing a suppression efficiency of about 89 fig 13 b shows that the maximum vibration displacement occurred when the controller was initially applied at which point the largest control force about 13 95 n was also exerted by the riser as the vibration gradually weakened the control force gradually fell until it was stable the control process of the adaptive fuzzy sliding mode controller was relatively smooth and the steady state accuracy was high the pre and post control trajectories of the center of mass of the riser are shown in fig 14 before control is applied the coupling vibration of the riser is normally a periodic 8 trajectory although the 8 shape is retained after the control is applied the cf and il amplitudes of the riser are smaller than before the vibration trajectory moves to the left due to the smaller average amplitude in the il direction controlling in the cf vibration also affects the il vibration the vibrations in both directions influence each other and the viv of the riser is a coupling vibration 5 2 3 analysis of the lift and drag coefficients the time history curves of the lift and drag coefficients for the riser before and after the control is applied are shown in fig 15 and for the fixed riser in fig 16 fig 15 shows that after the control is applied the drag coefficient gradually decreases and stabilizes at about 1 04 the lift coefficient increases until it becomes stable at an amplitude of 0 73 due to the inverse phase between the lift coefficient and the displacement amplitude within the reduced velocity range comparing these with the lift and drag coefficients for the fixed riser in fig 16 it is found that the lift and drag coefficients of the two degree of freedom riser tend to be in the state as the fixed riser but there is a little difference the main reason is that the viv of the riser is coupled vibration and its il vibration changes the flow field and affects its cf vibration so that the cf vibration of the fixed riser cannot be completely controlled fig 17 shows the phase trajectories of the lift and drag coefficients relative to the cf and il dimensionless amplitude responses before and after the cf control quantitatively revealing the dynamic characteristics of fluid structure interaction in fig 17 a the phase of lift coefficient and cf vibration displacement is located in the second and fourth quadrants and before the control is applied the lift coefficient is least when displacement is greatest this indicates that the cf vibration displacement of the riser is in inverse phase with the lift force as had previously been noted in the paper raza et al 2020 when the control is applied the interaction between the fluid and the structure changes greatly and the phase trajectory rotates counterclockwise and changes approximately on the y axis the displacement of the riser during cf vibration differs at 90 from the lift coefficient mainly because the application of the control alters the nature of the riser fluid interaction and results in the jump in phase difference the cf vibration displacement is effectively controlled and the amplitude drops from 0 59d to 0 03d in fig 17 b it can be seen that the vibration displacement of the riser in the il direction is in an inverse phase with the drag coefficient initially and remains out of phase after the control is applied this is because the mass ratio selected for the riser was relatively high and its vibration in the il direction was therefore not excessively violent moreover there is no il phase difference before and after application of the control since the il vibration is not controlled directly 5 2 4 analysis of vortex shedding fig 18 a g show the wake vorticity of the riser after the control is applied and fig 18 h n and fig 18 o u show the vibration amplitudes in the cf and il directions at different times the vibration of the riser is effectively controlled and the wake vortex shedding mode is changed from the c 2s mode to the 2s mode and similar phenomena was found by hasheminejad et al 2014 too at the early stage of the control process t 4 94 46 56s the near wake structure exhibits alternate shedding of vortices which appear in the form of coalescence in the far wake area which is defined as a c mode vortex coalescence which is a characteristic of the c 2s mode of high intensity vortex shedding williamson and roshko 1988 comparing the wake vorticity with the displacement amplitude it is found that the shape of the vortex shedding in the wake of the riser lags behind the displacement at t 46 56 s the displacements are greatly reduced fig 18 m 18 t and very stable in the cf direction but at this moment the wake vortex shows little change from the state before the control was applied and the wake vortex is still in the c 2s mode fig 18 f after the control force is applied to make the displacement amplitudes in the two directions reach stable states until t 55 s the wake vortex becomes the classic 2s kármán vortex street fig 18 g at this time the vortex shedding frequency and vortex shape of the riser are very similar to the flow around the fixed riser the hysteresis of riser vortex shedding and displacement change is mainly restricted by the delay of the stable displacement amplitude in the il direction 5 3 verification on robustness of the controller in order to verify the accuracy of the physical model of fluid structure interaction in this study and especially to demonstrate the excellent robustness of the adaptive fuzzy sliding mode controller and its effect on viv the disturbance the qualities stiffnesses and incoming flow velocities were modified and the control effect of the controller under different working conditions was analyzed firstly the designed adaptive fuzzy sliding mode controller is used to simulate when the initial value of the riser amplitude is 0 011m with the large disturbance f l 3 sin 12 9 t and small disturbance f l 0 5 c l ρ u 2 d sin ω t 0 205 sin 12 9 t and compared the control effect with the conventional quasi sliding mode control as shown in fig 19 and 20 the results show that the adaptive fuzzy sliding mode controller designed in this paper has better robustness compared with the quasi sliding mode control with saturated function when the external disturbance is large the steady state error caused by the adaptive fuzzy sliding mode controller is smaller when the control input is similar similarly when the external interference is less the desired trajectory can be reached faster and the performance of the controller is obviously better than the conventional quasi sliding mode control the riser mass and stiffness were modified by 20 above and below the original values fig 21 a b c and d respectively show the time history curves of the dimensionless displacement before and after applying control to risers of different mass and stiffness the natural frequency of the riser remains at 2 0 hz and the riser is still in the lock in region due to the synchronous change of the quality and stiffness of the riser it is clear in fig 21 that small changes of model parameter values cause large changes in the amplitude response of the riser when the mass stiffness of the riser increases by 20 the cf vibration takes longer to stabilize than the other two risers under the action of the current conversely when the mass and stiffness are reduced synchronously the system reaches stability more rapidly but the maximum amplitude is the same in the three cases when the mass stiffness of the riser is increased by 20 its average il displacement is about 0 012d which is less than for a mass stiffness reduction of 20 0 019d and the mass stiffness of the riser is unchanged 0 015d this is mainly due to the larger mass ratio and the weaker impact of the current on the riser making it nearer its original position furthermore the robustness of the active controller was verified when the effect of changing the velocities was investigated an of initial current velocity vr 5 5 was selected to ensure that the riser would be in the lock in region and the amplitude response of the riser was analyzed after a velocity change of 10 the time history curves of the dimensionless displacement before and after controlling the riser at different current velocities are shown in fig 22 before applying the control the time for its amplitude to stabilize increased with rising inlet velocity in the cf direction for example when the flow velocity increased by 10 the cf and il amplitudes of the riser were not stable but were still increasing after 45 s similarly the increase of flow velocity raised average amplitude of the riser in the il direction and the vibration balance position of the riser increased above the initial position after the control is applied the amplitudes in the cf and il directions of the riser were effectively controlled under different working conditions the controller has outstanding robustness for example when the current velocity was reduced by 10 the maximum amplitude of the riser decreased from about 0 530d to 0 025d and the vibration suppression efficiency was about 95 3 6 conclusions the viv of the two degrees of freedom riser was attained using fluent software combined with the user defined function the adaptive fuzzy sliding mode controller model for the viv of the riser was established in the study a collaborative simulation platform was built to simulate and analyze active control technology for viv in the lock in region of the riser the conclusions are as follows 1 the vibration of the two degree of freedom riser in the cf direction was more severe than that in the il direction it is in the lock in region at vr 5 6 the average amplitude in the il direction increased with the reduced velocity and the vibration in the cf direction of the riser was relatively weak outside that region with an amplitude less than 0 02d and the wake vortex was of the c 2s pattern 2 the proposed adaptive fuzzy sliding mode controller produced an outstanding control effect in the lock in region after the control was applied the cf and il amplitudes were attenuated greatly and the viv of the riser was effectively controlled the vibration suppression efficiencies were about 95 in the cf direction and about 89 in the il direction 3 the viv of the riser is an example of coupled vibration and affects the vibration in the il direction while controlling the cf vibration compared with the displacement variation vortex shedding was delayed in the wake of the riser after a period of control the wake behind the riser gradually approached the flow around the fixed riser and was of the 2s pattern 4 control effect and robustness of the adaptive fuzzy sliding mode controller is obviously better than that of the conventional quasi sliding mode control when the mass and stiffness were increased simultaneously or the velocity increased while the riser was in the lock in region the maximum amplitude of the riser barely changed but stabilization time was prolonged the proposed adaptive fuzzy sliding mode controller suppressed the viv of the riser well under different working conditions and is very adaptable and

20207,the passive buoyancy compensation liquid pbcl has been widely used in underwater vehicles operating in deep sea environments to reduce buoyancy loss caused by hull deformation and seawater density variation the heat transfer process of pbcl is an important factor that affects the net buoyancy and motion performance of the deep sea glider dg which was commonly neglected a comprehensive dynamic thermal model for petrel 4000 deep sea glider pdg with pbcl is established in this paper a model which considers the heat transfer process is proposed to estimate the volume change of pbcl these models are verified by comparing the numerical results with experimental data the effect of the heat transfer process on the motion performance of pdg is fully analyzed by comparisons with those not considering heat transfer process then the effect of pbcl distribution is discussed which shows that the reasonable pbcl distribution can facilitate a more stable gliding attitude of pdg energy consumption analysis is carried out and the results indicate that the application of pbcl is beneficial for energy saving especially under the lower power of the control system and measurement system

frame 1 introduction underwater gliders can repeatedly achieve profile measurements with the advantages of long range low cost low noise etc they are playing an increasingly important role in the field of oceanic environmental survey the oceangliders program started in 2016 to support active coordination and enhancement of global glider activity underwater gliders contribute to the international efforts of the global ocean observation system goos for climate ocean health and operational services testor et al 2019 with the progress of science and technology underwater exploration has become a research hotspot in recent years under this background underwater glider technology gets rapid development in 1989 henry stommel proposed the concept of underwater glider first stommel 1989 in the following decades many groups proposed their early underwater gliders such as slocum webb et al 2001 seaglider eriksen et al 2001 spray sherman et al 2001 and petrel wang et al 2011 the maximum working depth of the gliders listed above is 1500 m however the average depth of the global ocean is 3850 m therefore it is necessary to extend the observation depth of underwater gliders to a greater depth nowadays several deep sea gliders dgs have been developed such as the ultradeep explorer glider bridges 2016 the deepglider osse and eriksen 2007 the sea wing7000 glider yu et al 2017 and the petrel x glider wang et al 2019 their maximum working depths are 5000 m 6000 m 7000 m and 10 000 m respectively however environmental variations with seawater pressure temperature and density present great challenges for the operation of underwater gliders in the deep sea the hull deformation caused by seawater pressure and the variation in seawater density has a non negligible effect on the net buoyancy of underwater vehicles the net buoyancy variation degrades motion performance and makes it difficult for underwater gliders to dive deeper yang et al 2017 gao et al 2017 zhou et al 2020 specifically when underwater gliders need to submerge deeper their buoyancy control systems have to adjust a large amount of hydraulic oil which brings huge energy consumption and limits the duration and range of sailing therefore it is of practical significance to find an advanced approach that can compensate for the net buoyancy loss and reduce the energy consumption of the buoyancy control system to drive dg more efficiently various passive compensation approaches to minimize or adapt to the buoyancy variation with depth have been investigated or developed in the engineered and natural worlds tang et al 2018 designed a 1200 m depth neutrally buoyant pressure hull using bi directional evolutionary topology method to reduce the buoyancy loss yang et al 2020 designed a multiple intersecting spheres mis pressure hull to provide neutral buoyancy for a 1000 m depth underwater glider eriksen et al 2001 presented an isopycnal pressure hull designed for a 1000 m depth seaglider to match the compressibility of the vehicle to the seawater density variation observed over the operating depth of the vehicle however these materials and structures cannot effectively apply to the deep sea pressure jiang et al 2019 in the natural world many species of marine animals have their solutions to maintain neutral buoyancy benthic sharks use the large volumes of hydrocarbon squalene in their livers to regulate buoyancy corner et al 1969 some species of squid use ammonia rich solution to regulate buoyancy clarke et al 1979 the use of fluid buoyancy enables the compression of the system to match the increase of seawater density and achieve neutral buoyancy during descending and ascending however the thermal effect of the fluid is also a non negligible factor to buoyancy change the response of the liquid to pressure change is essentially instantaneous but its temperature change depends on the heat transfer rate between the exterior and interior of the marine animals upon surfacing their body would gradually warm up and its buoyancy would increase to the value at thermal equilibrium priede et al 2020 taking inspiration from nature phillips et al 2012 developed an isopycnal soft bodied autonomous underwater vehicle auv to tackle buoyancy variations the light mineral oil 69 05 of total volume filled inside its soft shell is more compressible than seawater and the batteries and internal structures are less compressible than seawater this passively maintains neutral buoyancy over 0 6000 m depth range furlong et al 2012 utilized high low pressure air compensators and silicon oil to reduce the buoyancy variation of the autosub lr auv within 6000 m depth wang et al 2019 proposed a novel full ocean depth glider carrying silicon oil for hadal observations which effectively enables dg to dive to 10 000 m due to the application of a large amount of liquid for buoyancy compensation underwater vehicles similar to those marine animals will also be exposed to temperature effects especially for those that need to achieve profile measurements repeatedly such as underwater gliders however few of the current studies focus on the application of pbcl to dg and it lacks a specific analysis of the impact of the heat transfer process on motion performance the first generation 4000 m dg designed and developed by tianjin university china was tested in the mariana trench in april 2018 the sea trial situation is shown in fig 1 the shell of the glider is made of titanium alloys which increases the ratio of weight to buoyancy therefore it is necessary to design a bigger size to increase buoyancy which leads to the mass 240 kg and volume of the glider far beyond the project design index and requires more pbcl 28 l in total to compensate for the net buoyancy loss in addition because of the large amount of pbcl it takes more heat transfer time to ensure sufficient thermal expansion for increasing the net buoyancy so when the glider approaches the sea surface a in fig 1 b it almost stops moving up therefore the heat transfer process of pbcl on motion performance is non negligible in the ocean environment dynamic modeling and motion behavior prediction of underwater gliders which are essential to maneuverability design motion performance and energy consumption optimization have been widely investigated the most famous and commonly used dynamic models of underwater gliders were derived by leonard and graver 2001 wang and wang 2009 woolsey 2011 thomasson and woolsey 2013 zhang et al 2013 wang et al 2014 fan and woolsey 2014 etc the environmentally induced parameter changes have also been introduced to these dynamic models a dynamic model for hybrid driven underwater glider considering the seawater density variation and hull deformation was established by yang et al 2017 which is more suitable for dg and helps effectively analyze the impact of buoyancy on motion performance with environmental parameter variation gao et al 2017 explained the gradual decrease of the dg pitch angle during the descent process by a nonlinear dynamic model based on kirchhoff s equations considering the hull deformation seawater temperature and density variations wang et al 2019 described the dynamic modeling and motion analysis for a dual buoyancy driven full ocean depth glider carrying pbcl by considering the environmental parameters and corresponding displaced volume change of the entire glider in the previous study carried out by wang et al 2019 the effect of pbcl on the reduction of dg buoyancy loss is studied and the buoyancy loss is reduced by 70 8 from 0 m to 10 000 m depth however the temperature of pbcl was treated consistent with the seawater temperature so the influence of the heat transfer process on motion performance and buoyancy change is yet to be clarified elevating energy efficiency is the key to increasing the underwater glider s endurance and expanding its sailing range zhou et al 2020 furthermore in the analysis of energy consumption of dg the effects of environmental parameter variation and the heat transfer process of pbcl on energy consumption cannot be ignored consequently the energy consumption model cannot be established based on steady motion models song et al 2020 yang et al 2019 additionally the underwater glider is the ideal platform to carry out observation missions in the ocean environment a comprehensive and precise understanding of their velocity trajectory and buoyancy is of vital importance for design and operation of underwater gliders underwater gliders can be equipped with various oceanographic optical and acoustic payloads which may have specific requirements for motion performance of the gliders peterson and fer 2014 palmer et al 2015 todd et al 2017 stinco et al 2020 some important parameters of the marine environment can also be derived with the dynamic model of the glider such as internal wave and vertical water velocities rudnick et al 2013 merckelbach et al 2010 2019 frajka williams et al 2011 the heat transfer process of pbcl affects net buoyancy of the dg in dynamics and then affects dynamic behaviors of the dg in addition the heat transfer process is further related to the gliding velocity and trajectory of the dg therefore it is essential to establish a more accurate dynamic model for the dg carrying pbcl considering the heat transfer process in the real ocean environment the present work focuses on the improved 4000 m petrel 4000 dg developed by tianjin university firstly a comprehensive dynamic thermal model considering the heat transfer process of pbcl is built in the real ocean environment to estimate the motion performance and buoyancy change of the vehicle then the accuracy of the model is verified by comparing the simulation data with the experimental data additionally the effect of the heat transfer process of pbcl on dynamic behaviors of the glider is discussed in detail by comparisons with those not considering heat transfer process and then the effect of pbcl distribution is discussed finally energy consumption analysis is carried out by disassembling a profile 2 mathematical models 2 1 configuration of petrel 4000 deep sea glider this article takes the petrel 4000 deep sea glider carrying pbcl designed independently by tianjin university as the object of study detailed design specifications of the pdg are given in table 1 and its geometry is shown in fig 2 the pdg has a torpedo shape similar to the legacy gliders the buoyancy can be easily affected by the seawater density variation and the density of seawater varies with temperature salinity and pressure which vary in different seas yang et al 2017 considering this the pdg is designed to be propelled by the electro hydraulic buoyancy control system with pbcl the pbcl is filled in the hollow cylindrical and flexible containers which are located in the fore and aft fairings respectively the schematic diagram of the pbcl is shown in fig 3 the motion process of a gliding profile of the glider is similar to that of the petrel l glider described by a previous research yang et al 2019 when the pdg moves up or down in the water column the mass of pbcl remains constant in the short term irrespective of the negligible leakage but the density volume changes from the initial value in response to pressure and temperature variation when the pdg moves up to the shallow warm water layer the temperature of seawater is higher than that of pbcl the pbcl absorbs heat from the ocean and the environmental pressure is reduced thus the volume of pbcl expands after its net buoyancy changes from positive to negative on the sea surface the pdg begins to dive when the pdg moves down to the deep cold water layer the pbcl releases heat to the ocean and the environmental pressure is increased which causes cooling and contracting of the pbcl the volume change rate of the pbcl during ascent and descent processes decides the net buoyancy of the pdg accordingly the heat transfer process of pbcl will affect the motion performance of the pdg 2 2 environment model the pdg descends and ascends between sea surface and 4000 m depth temperature pressure and density of the seawater change with depth as observed by pdg in the south china sea density is derived with basic temperature salinity and pressure parameters fig 4 according to the equation of state of seawater here this paper employs the high pressure equation of the 1980 international equation of state of seawater eos 80 fofonoff and millard 1983 millero et al 1980 the temperature t sea and density ρ sea of seawater from the sea surface down to 4000 m can be described by the following quartic polynomial formulas yang et al 2017 2019 1 t sea a 1 h 6 a

related to the density of seawater and the depth as follows 3 p ρ sea h g p 0 where h is the depth p 0 is the standard atmospheric pressure p 0 1 01325 105 pa and g is the acceleration of gravity which varies little with the latitude and depth and thus is considered as 9 8 kg m3 jiang et al 2019 2 3 kinematic and dynamic models of pdg in this paper the equations to describe the motion of the pdg are established in a body fixed frame o xyz while the trajectory is expressed in the earth fixed frame e xyz the body fixed frame o xyz is established at the center of buoyancy of the glider the x axis coincides with the longitudinal axis of the glider the z axis lies in the wing plane pointing to right when viewed along the direction of x the y axis is selected by x z the coordinate systems are shown in fig 2 the forces acting on the pdg include hydrodynamic forces and moments gravity and buoyancy moreover the center of gravity cg does not coincide with the center of buoyancy cb so a moment of the gravity is generated on the center of buoyancy in addition to the net buoyancy and hydrodynamic forces to obtain a dynamic model for the pdg the momentum theorem and the moment of momentum theorem are applied in the body fixed frame lyu et al 2019 4 d p d t ω p f d l d t ω l v p m where p and l represent the momentum and moment of momentum respectively f and m are forces and

when there is roll motion it is also assumed that j xy j yz j xz 0 as they are too small to affect the results compared with j x j y and j z thus their corresponding terms are eliminated and the

moment from the flow frame to the body fixed frame as 11 f h r o v f h m h r o v m h unlike conventional underwater gliders the pdg uses both buoyancy control system and pbcl to change its wet mass and cg in the process the moment of inertia is also changed consequently when expanding d a m d t in eq 7 it gets 12 d a m d t m 0 0 0 0 m y g 0 m 0 0 0 m x g m x g 0 0 m m y g m x g m x g 0 0 0 m y g

mathematical model is then established to research changes of the variables during gliding motion during the regulatory process and gliding motion the moment of inertia the center of gravity and mass are affected by the inner devices then x g m x g j y and j z in eqs 13 18 can be calculated 13 x g m i x i m i m oil x oil m w x w m b x b m cl x cl m 0 x 0 m oil m w m b m cl m 0 where the footnotes

are calculated by combining eqs 14 17 and expressed by predefined parameters or variables the buoyancy of the pdg b is mainly provided by the pressure hull oil bladder and pbcl as 19 b b h b e b cl where b h b e and b cl represent the buoyancy of the pressure hull oil bladder and pbcl respectively since both seawater density and pressure change with depth the buoyancy of the hull can be calculated by considering hull deformation and seawater density variation as 20 b h ρ sea v h 0 1 κ t sea t sea 0 ε p p 0 g where v h0 represents the volume of the pressure hull on the sea surface t

motion of the pdg in the longitudinal plane table 3 lists the main geometrics parameters related to pbcl hydrodynamics coefficients the added mass and inertia matrix of the pdg 2 4 thermal model the pbcl is filled in two hollow cylindrical and flexible containers inside the fairings of pdg as shown in fig 3 the glider will confront a variable thermal environment from the sea surface to the target depth the external heat flux involves the convective heat transfer between the outer hull and seawater inside the liquid heat fluxes include the natural convection and heat conduction in order to establish the thermal model of pbcl the following conditions are assumed a the pbcl is homogeneous and isotropic and thermal conductivity along the axis direction of the hollow cylindrical vessel can be ignored b the specific capacity and thermal conductivity of the pbcl are constant and independent of temperature and pressure c the effect of natural convection during the heat transfer process is considered by introducing the effective conductivity the heat transfer process is mainly controlled by heat conduction d the contact resistance of different interfaces in the heat transfer process is neglected this section mainly deals with the law of volume change during the heat transfer process and the velocity profile of pbcl is not a focus here which however does influence the heat transfer process therefore the effective thermal conductivity k eff is induced to express the influence of natural convection of the pbcl during the heat transfer process ismail and abugderah 2000 hirata and nishida 1989 thus the energy conservation equation can be written as 24 t t k eff ρ cl c p cl 2 t r 2 1 r t r where c p cl is the specific capacity of pbcl r is the radius ρ cl is the density of pbcl t is the temperature and k eff is the effective thermal conductivity as 25 k eff t 0 228 r a l t 1 4 1 d t d 1 4 k cl where ra l is rayleigh number d is the inner diameter of the cylinder d is the outer diameter of the cylinder and k cl is the thermal conductivity of pbcl energy equations for the wall of the fairings and containers are 26 t t k f ρ f c p f 2 t r 2 1 r t r t t k c ρ c c p c 2 t r 2 1 r t r where k f and k c are the thermal conductivity ρ f and ρ c are the density c p f and c p c are the specific capacity of the fairings and containers respectively when operating in the real ocean environment dgs will experience buoyancy variation with depth due to pressure hull deformation and seawater density variation yang et al 2017 gao et al 2017 similarly the pdg moves up and down in the ocean at a variable speed the external convective heat transfer between the outer surface of the fairing and seawater can be forced convection the heat transfers from the seawater to the hull and fairing by convection the boundary condition is as follows 27 k f t r 0 t r h c t r 0 t t sea t where r 0 is the outer radius of the fairing and h c is the convection coefficient 28 h c k s n u l

number and pr is prandtl number of seawater the fairing and pbcl are in direct touch with the container thus continuous boundary conditions are also defined herein supposing that the pbcl flow is nearly negligible at the same time finally the equations set on the continuous boundary conditions are expressed below 30 t f r r 1 t c r r 1 k f t r r r 1 k c t r r r 1 t c r r 2 t cl r r 2 k c t r r r 2 k cl t r r r 2 where footnotes f c and cl represent the heat transfer mediums of the fairing container and pbcl respectively r 1 is the inner radius of the fairing and r 2 is the outer radius of pbcl in the beginning the glider is assumed at a stable thermal equilibrium state on the sea surface the initial temperatures of fairing container and pbcl are equal to the seawater temperature t sea0 then the initial condition is 31 t r 0 t t sea0 the main thermal parameters related to pbcl are listed in table 3 2 5 numerical model of pbcl volume change during the heat transfer process when the pdg moves up or down in the water column irrespective of the negligible pbcl leakage in the short term the mass of pbcl remains constant but the density changes from the initial value in response to pressure and temperature variation a simple experiment is put forward to test the pressure temperature and density ptd of pbcl during the heat transfer process the ptd relationship is measured using a hydraulic cylinder enclosed within a temperature controlled water tank a high pressure hydraulic pump applies the pressure a schematic diagram of the experimental apparatus is shown in fig 5 the experimental system can be divided into a pressure control unit and a temperature control and density measurement unit the pressure control unit consists of a high pressure hydraulic pump 3 to provide constant pressure load a low pressure hydraulic pump 1 to ensure the inlet pressure of the high pressure hydraulic pump overflow valves 4 and 5 to maintain the constant pressure a filter 2 a pressure sensor 6 a one way valve 7 a hand valve 8 and an oil tank 9 the temperature control and density measurement unit includes a hydraulic cylinder 11 to measure the volume variation of the pbcl a displacement sensor 12 a water tank 14 to provide a suitable environment temperature for the hydraulic cylinder a water temperature controller 13 to control the environment temperature around the hydraulic cylinder and a pressure sensor 10 to measure the pressure of the pbcl since the pbcl is stored in the rod chamber of the hydraulic cylinder its volume variation can be recorded indirectly by recording the piston rod displacement of the hydraulic cylinder when reaching thermal equilibrium ascending pressure increments are applied allowing sufficient time to stabilize at each new pressure when the piston rod of the hydraulic cylinder does not move the sampling process can be considered as completed liquid density as a function of pressure and temperature can be fitted with a linear polynomial equation zhang et al 2020 wang et al 2020 the density of pbcl is defined as 32 ρ cl 9 023 10 7 p 1 038 t 1085 0 to analyze the volume change of pbcl a number of nodes with an equal interval are designed in the radial direction of the pbcl region and the positions of nodes are shown in fig 6 the change rate of volume i relative to the volume of original pbcl at time step j is 33 φ i j δ v cl i j v cl0 1 ρ cl i j 1 ρ cl i j 1 ρ cl 0 m i m cl where δv cl i j is the volume change of i at time step j m i is the mass of volume i m cl is the total mass of pbcl ρ cl0 and v cl0 represent the density and volume of pbcl on the sea surface respectively and ρ cl i j is the average density of volume i at time step j 34 m i m cl ρ cl i j 1 r i j 1 2 r i 1 j 1 2 ρ cl0 r 2 2 r 3 2 where r i j is the interface diameter of the adjacent nodes i and i 1 at time step j and r 3 is the inner radius of pbcl equation 33 can be simplified as 35 φ i j ρ cl i j 1 ρ cl i j 1 r i j 1 2 r i 1 j 1 2 r 2 2 r

6 simulation method the dynamic eq 7 is a typical ordinary differential equation the standard fourth order runge kutta method can be applied to discretize the dynamic equation liu 2014 wu et al 2020 equations 24 26 and 27 are partial differential equations and the finite difference method is used in this paper kong et al 2010 xia et al 2018 based on the discrete equations expressed above a program is developed with matlab to simulate the gliding motion performance of the pdg and the volume change of the pbcl as illustrated in fig 7 the framework of the process is divided into two modules the trajectory calculation module takes hydrodynamic performance parameters of buoyancy control and pitch control system and volume of the pbcl as input by solving the kinematic and dynamic equations the motion parameters are obtained as output the thermal calculation module begins with the environment model and thermal parameters and ends with the output of pbcl volume by solving the thermal equations for better understanding of the performance simulation program for the glider the pseudo code of the program is elaborated in algorithm 1 since this paper focuses on the transient behavior of heat transport of the pbcl during the ascent and descent processes for the sake of simplicity and clarity the processes of buoyancy control and pitch control are not considered and thus the constant buoyancy and distance travelled by the battery package are predefined as in the following numerical simulation algorithm 1 pseudo code for the performance simulation of the glider image 1 3 sea trial experimental validation in order to evaluate the accuracy of the models dynamic behaviors of the pdg predicted by the simulation results are compared with those in the sea trials the sea trials were conducted around 18 11 n and 116 10 e in the south china sea a series of gliding experiments have been performed fig 8 shows the experimental prototype and the motion path of pdg a ctd sensor idronaut r s l os304plus was mounted to measure the operating depth conductivity and temperature the measured depth rate was used to estimate the vertical velocity of pdg the attitude angles of the glider roll yaw and pitch were measured by a tcm3 digital compass pni sensor corporation two profiles a and b are selected for comparison the target depths of the two profiles are both 3200 m correspondingly the distances l b travelled by the movable battery package are set 16 mm and 19 mm for profile a and 15 mm and 19 mm for profile b during descending and ascending respectively the volume fractions of the hydraulic oil in the oil tank are set 94 and 3 during descending and ascending respectively after completing each profile the pdg waited on the sea surface for approximately an hour to allow the pbcl to get the same temperature with the seawater the area between the two blue dotted lines in fig 9 the simulation results and the experimental results are shown in fig 9 the gliding depths of the glider from the simulation results and the sea trials are shown in fig 9 a the maximum error of depth between simulation and the sea trials is 46 m for profile a and 24 m for profile b respectively within the same simulation time the comparison of the pitch angles obtained from the simulation results and sea trials is shown in fig 9 b the previous experimental results obtained in the real ocean environment show that the pitch angle decreases with depth in both ascending and descending processes yang et al 2017 gao et al 2017 different from this the pitch angle from sea trials data firstly increases and then decreases with depth in the descending process and decreases with depth in the ascending process for profile a the pitch angle increases from 20 to 22 and back to 18 in gliding descent and decreases from 22 to 15 in gliding ascent the variation trend of pitch angle from the simulation results is consistent with that in the sea trials the pitch angle increases from 19 8 to 22 5 and back to 18 9 in gliding descent and decreases from 22 7 to 14 5 in gliding ascent for profile b the pitch angle obtained from sea trials increases from 17 to 20 and back to 16 in gliding descent and decreases from 22 to 15 in gliding ascent the variation trend of pitch angle from the simulation results is consistent with that in the sea trials the pitch angle increases from 17 6 to 20 5 and back to 16 8 in gliding descent and decreases from 22 7 to 14 5 in gliding ascent the maximum errors of pitch angle between the simulation results and the sea trials are both less than 2 in the near steady gliding stage the simulation results can reflect the variation trend of the pitch angle from sea trials in addition in the communication and waiting phase the area between the two blue dotted lines in fig 9 the trailing antenna emerges from the sea surface and the magnitude of pitch angle shall be larger than 45 to facilitate the communication yang et al 2019 in the practical operation the glider is affected by the waves on the sea surface so the pitch angle experiences large fluctuations these situations are not considered in the simulation c in fig 9 b fig 9 c compares vertical gliding velocities obtained from the simulation results and sea trials in sea trials the vertical velocity shows a similar variation trend with the pitch angle in gliding descent the vertical velocity from sea trials changes from 0 25 to 0 15 m s for profile a and changes from 0 23 to 0 13 m s for profile b in gliding ascent the vertical velocity from sea trials changes from 0 25 to 0 12 m s for both profiles a and b the maximum deviations of vertical velocity between the simulation results and sea trials in the two profiles are both less than 0 05 m s in near steady gliding stage the variation trends of vertical velocity for the two profiles achieved in the simulation are the same as those achieved in sea trials several factors may have contributed to the discrepancies between experimental results and simulation results firstly it may be attributed to the several assumptions and simplifications of the thermal model in the heat transfer process as mentioned above secondly there may be a certain amount of gas dissolved in the pbcl which can be easily compressed according to bayes theory when the pressure is ten times the initial pressure the gas volume becomes one tenth of the original therefore when the glider actually dives to merely 100 m the net buoyancy changes dramatically during this process as a result there are large discrepancies in motion performance near the sea surface thirdly the control parameter errors include the error of net buoyancy adjustment amount and that of movable battery package displacement amount which can also cause great motion deviations wu et al 2020 finally the diving preparation phase and the climbing preparation phase are relatively short in the whole profile since this paper mainly focuses on the pitch angle and velocity of the whole gliding process these complex and short phases are neglected during the simulation to simplify the dynamic model from the above analysis the dynamic and thermal models established in the present work are proven to be effective and credible and can precisely predict dynamic behaviors of the glider 4 results and discussions 4 1 effect of the heat transfer process of pbcl in order to further verify the effect of the heat transfer process of pbcl this study compares dynamic behaviors of the pdg predicted by the dynamic thermal model hereinafter referred to as the dt model and those predicted by a conventional dynamic model hereinafter referred to as the d model without considering the heat transfer process of pbcl this section mainly analyzes the gliding motion process a single profile the distance l b travelled by the movable battery package is set 16 mm and 19 mm in the gliding descent and ascent respectively the volume fraction of the hydraulic oil in the oil tank is 94 and 3 in gliding descent and ascent respectively the simulation time for the descent process is set 15 800 s the simulation results are shown in fig 10 fig 10 a c illustrate the gliding trajectories depths and voyages predicted by dt model and d model it can be seen that the gliding trajectory predicted by dt model is not parallel with that by d model both in the gliding descent from 0 m to 2000 m and gliding ascent from 1000 m to 0 m especially in the former the maximum depth and voyage predicted by d model are 3461 m and 16 298 m respectively which are 296 m and 652 m larger than those by dt model fig 10 d illustrates the pitch angles predicted by dt model and d model which show different variation trends in the gliding descent from 50 m to 2000 m the pitch angle of the glider with dt model is always less than the one with d model and the difference between them firstly increases to a maximum value of 5 4 and then decreases in the gliding descent from 2000 m to the deepest depth and the gliding ascent from the deepest depth to 1000 m the pitch angles of the glider with dt model and d model are almost equal in the gliding ascent from 1000 m to 50 m the pitch angles have the same variation trend with the gliding descent from 50 m to 2000m with a maximum difference of 6 1 fig 10 e and f show the vertical and horizontal velocities in the earth fixed frame predicted by dt model and d model which show a similar variation trend with the pitch angles in the gliding descent and ascent the maximum difference of the vertical velocities is 0 10 m s and 0 07 m s respectively it can be seen from fig 4 that density variation and temperature variation of seawater are greater at a depth of less than 300 m to emphasize the influence of the heat transfer process velocity fluctuations from 300 m to 3000 m are discussed in the gliding descent the variation range of vertical velocity with dt model is from 0 17 to 0 23 m s and the one with d model is from 0 17 to 0 29 m s in the gliding ascent the variation range of vertical velocity with dt model is from 0 13 to 0 25 m s and the one with d model is from 0 12 to 0 25 m s it is clear from fig 10 f that the trends of horizontal velocities are same with those of vertical velocities in dt model and d model moreover the maximum difference of the horizontal velocities is 0 12 m s and 0 15 m s in the gliding descent and ascent respectively in summary it can be seen that the variation magnitudes of the pitch angle the vertical velocity and the horizontal velocity with d model are larger than their counterparts with dt model in the gliding descent and smaller in the gliding ascent the phenomenon that the gliding trajectories pitch angles and velocities from dt model are different from those from d model can be attributed to the variation of net buoyancy caused by the heat transfer process of pbcl the temperature is generally higher on the sea surface which decreases rapidly in the range of 40 m 400 m depth commonly called thermocline and then falls slowly below the thermocline fig 4 a when the water depth is greater than 1500 m the temperature is almost constant thereafter the volume change of the pbcl is only affected by the pressure the temperature and volume of pbcl in dt model and d model are shown in fig 11 the temperature of the pbcl is consistent with that of the seawater in the d model however influenced by the heat transfer process of pbcl the temperature change of pbcl lags behind that of seawater as shown in fig 11 a which will also lead to different volumes of pbcl during the descent and ascent in the two models as shown in fig 11 b thus in the dt model that considers the time required by the heat transfer process of pbcl buoyancy changes are delayed for a certain amount of time which will result in a difference in buoyancy with d model fig 12 it can be seen from fig 12 that during the descent the glider has sufficient time to synchronize the temperatures of the pbcl and the seawater however during the ascent when the temperature of the pbcl is lower than that of the seawater especially when the glider traverses the thermocline it leaves less time for the glider to complete the synchronization of temperature upon surfacing the glider would gradually warm up and its buoyancy would increase to the value at thermal equilibrium that s why the glider in fig 1 b almost stopped moving up as it approached the sea surface the pitch angle and velocity of the glider mainly depend on the net buoyancy and the distance l b travelled by the movable battery package liu 2014 yang et al 2017 with the same l b the pitch angle and velocity change with the net buoyancy therefore the pitch angle and velocity of the glider with both dt model and d model change continuously fig 10 d f following the variation trend of net buoyancy of the pdg fig 12 in brief the heat transfer process of pbcl has a significant effect on the net buoyancy variation and motion performance of pdg especially when it passes through a water column with a large temperature difference 4 2 effect of the pbcl distribution the three elements of force are magnitude direction and point of action and the change in the magnitude of the net buoyancy caused by pbcl is accompanied by a change in the point of action caused by pbcl distribution from fig 9 b when other parameters of the two profiles are identical the magnitude of the pitch angle of profile a is 2 larger than that of profile b in gliding descent which is because the distance l b travelled by the movable battery package of profile a is greater than that of profile b namely that the center of gravity of profile a is farther to the original point in the body fixed frame than that of profile b thus the change in the center of gravity caused by pbcl also influences motion performance according to eqs 13 14 and 17 the change in center of gravity caused by pbcl is calculated under the same set of control parameter values of profile a in section 3 fig 13 shows the position change of the center of gravity caused by pbcl with dt model in the body fixed frame at a depth of 3200 m pbcl distribution brings about 1 27 mm forward movement of the center of gravity which is equivalent to the effect of 9 mm forward movement of the battery package the forward movement and backward movement of the center of gravity in the gliding descent and ascent will increase pitch angle which will counteract the decrease of the pitch angle caused by the decrease of the net buoyancy however due to the influence of time delay caused by the heat transfer process of pbcl the relative change of the center of gravity in the descending process is greater than the one in the ascending process for conventional underwater gliders without pbcl feedback control of the glider is intermittently performed to keep the target pitch angle the pitch angle variation can be minimized by employing a closed loop pitch angle control or setting a lower limit touching which the pitch angle is adjusted by moving the battery package yang et al 2017 gao et al 2017 wu et al 2020 therefore during the adjustment the pitch angle will change dramatically however the utilization of pbcl effectively mitigates this phenomenon with which a continuous change of pitch angle can be achieved to study the influence of pbcl distribution on the pitch angle the distances l f and l a of pbcl are both set to range from 0 85 m to 1 05 m in 0 05 m increments in the rest of this section the distance l b travelled by the movable battery package is set 16 mm and 19 mm in gliding descent and ascent respectively the volume fraction of the oil in the oil tank is set 94 and 3 in gliding descent and ascent respectively the target depth is 4000 m the magnitude of pitch angle variation obtained from the simulation results is shown in fig 14 the pbcl distribution shows an obvious impact on the change of the pitch angle the magnitudes of pitch angle variation are 1 6 and 4 8 in the descent and ascent stages when the fore and aft distances of the pbcl are set 1 05 m and 0 85 m respectively under the same condition the magnitude of pitch angle variation in the ascent process is larger than that in the descent process and the trends of the variation are same in both processes in summary the pbcl distribution has a significant influence on the change of pitch angle which can facilitate a more stable gliding attitude of pdg and be adjustable according to the requirements of the task for example some sensors require specific pitch angles of the glider to ensure the measurement accuracy such as microrider peterson and fer 2014 palmer et al 2015 4 3 energy saving with pbcl at present the underwater glider is mainly supplied by the battery to carry out its mission furthermore in the analysis of energy consumption of underwater glider the effect of net buoyancy variation on energy consumption cannot be ignored in addition this paper does not consider the specific control process it only focuses on adjustment of the distance l b travelled by the movable battery package and volume fraction of the hydraulic oil in the oil tank to the target values in theory the whole motion process of the glider is periodic zigzag motion the energy consumption of whole motion process can be calculated by that of a single profile song et al 2020 wu et al 2021 yang et al 2019 the energy is consumed by control system measurement system buoyancy control system attitude control system and communication system in the gliding motion process in a single profile the control system and measurement system are constantly working therefore their energy consumption is closely related to the motion time t m which can be obtained by dynamic simulation the energy consumption of the attitude control system e p and that of the communication system e c in the communication phase for a single profile are referred to as constants the buoyancy control system is activated twice in a gliding cycle once in the diving preparation phase and once in the climbing preparation phase in the diving preparation phase the hydraulic oil is pressed by atmospheric pressure to flow from the external oil bladder into the internal oil tank when the solenoid valve works the power and flow rate of the solenoid valve are denoted as p v and q v respectively in the climbing preparation phase the hydraulic oil is pumped into the external oil bladder the power and flow rate of the hydraulic pump are denoted as p p and q p respectively in the diving and climbing phases the energy is consumed by the control system and measurement system consequently the total energy consumption e a in a single profile can be calculated as 38 e a p m t m 1000 v 1 p v 1000 q v v 2 p p 1000 q p e p e c where v 1 is the volume of hydraulic oil pressed back into the internal oil tank v 2 is the volume of hydraulic oil pumped into the external oil bladder and p m is the average power of the control system and measurement system which ranges from 0 5 w to 5 w then the average energy utilization rate ξ of the glider is defined as wu et al 2021 39 ξ x a e a where x a is the displacement of pdg in horizontal direction in a single profile obtained by dynamic simulation and ξ is the voyage powered by 1 kj energy a larger ξ represents a higher energy utilization rate of the glider this paper takes the maximum design depth 4000 m as a case to study the energy saving effect of the glider with pbcl the key parameters of the energy consumption model are shown in table 4 measured by experiments in order to discuss the motion performance and energy consumption of pbcl equipped glider in a real ocean environment simulations are established under two conditions condition a the glider operating with the pbcl and condition b the glider operating without the pbcl the same operation objectives need to be specified to make a fair comparison of energy consumption two volumes of hydraulic oil for diving are set to ensure that the glider can reach same net buoyancy at a maximum depth 4000 m under conditions a and b condition a adopts the same set of control parameters of profile a in section 3 in contrast the hydraulic oil volume v 2 of condition b is 1 5 l larger than that of condition a fig 15 shows the comparison results of the motion process under conditions a and b as shown in fig 15 a compared with condition b the glider with the pbcl under condition a takes almost twice the time for total motion process this is because when carrying the pbcl the glider has a lower average net buoyancy during the motion process fig 15 b shows the displacement of pdg in the horizontal direction the displacement under condition a is larger than that under condition b since the average pitch angle is smaller when pbcl is carried fig 15 c shows the pitch angle variation when the displacement of the movable battery package is set to remain stationary the change in net buoyancy under condition a will affect the stabilization of pitch angle the introduction of the pbcl effectively reduces the variation range of pitch angle which can help maintain the stability of the glider s attitude fig 15 d shows that the vertical velocity change is consistent with the pitch angle variation it is clear that the pbcl has an important contribution to reducing the change of pitch angle and vertical velocity according to eqs 38 and 49 2 of the energy consumption of the buoyancy control system can be saved by employing pbcl although the motion time of condition a has been extended 44 7 the gliding range with the p m of 2 w still increases by 44 3 compared with that under condition b fig 16 shows the increasing rate of the gliding range after adopting pbcl when the average power of the control system and measurement system p m ranges from 0 5 w to 5 w the increasing rate of the gliding range decreases as the average power p m increases which is because the total energy saving of the glider is also related to the total motion time although the energy consumption caused by the heavy load at high pressure is contracted by the adoption of pbcl other glider units still consume too much energy leading to an increase in overall energy consumption of the glider in a longer total motion time therefore in order to reduce the energy consumption of the glider it is necessary to appropriately decrease the average power of the control system and measurement system 5 conclusions in this work a comprehensive dynamic thermal model considering the heat transfer process of pbcl is proposed for the pdg kinematic and dynamic simulations are carried out with the proposed model the simulation results show good consistency with sea trial data which validates the proposed model then the effects of the heat transfer process and distribution of pbcl on the pdg in the real ocean environment as well as the energy saving effect are simulated and analyzed the following conclusions can be drawn from this work 1 the effect of the heat transfer process of pbcl is non negligible buoyancy changes caused by pbcl are delayed for a certain amount of time greatly influencing the descending depth pitch angle and vertical velocity of the pdg especially as the pdg passes through the water column with a large temperature difference in the descent process besides for the deep sea gliders with pbcl the buoyancy variation would make it difficult for them to ascend when approaching the sea surface 2 the pbcl can compensate for the net buoyancy loss and obtain a more stable gliding attitude of the pdg the distribution of the pbcl shows a significant impact on the pitch angle variation and increasing the ratio of fore distance to aft distance can reduce the magnitude of pitch angle variation the minimum magnitude is 1 6 and 4 8 in the descent and ascent process respectively 3 49 2 of the energy consumption of the buoyancy control can be saved when the pdg is equipped with pbcl which is effective to increase the gliding range the enhancing effect is more obvious with the decrease in the average power of the control system and measurement system though proposed for petrel 4000 deep sea glider the comprehensive dynamic thermal model applies to simulation and design analysis of other deep sea gliders further research will be carried out to enhance the performance of deep sea gliders with pbcl the next step is to explore the control strategy that simultaneously ensures the

20207,the passive buoyancy compensation liquid pbcl has been widely used in underwater vehicles operating in deep sea environments to reduce buoyancy loss caused by hull deformation and seawater density variation the heat transfer process of pbcl is an important factor that affects the net buoyancy and motion performance of the deep sea glider dg which was commonly neglected a comprehensive dynamic thermal model for petrel 4000 deep sea glider pdg with pbcl is established in this paper a model which considers the heat transfer process is proposed to estimate the volume change of pbcl these models are verified by comparing the numerical results with experimental data the effect of the heat transfer process on the motion performance of pdg is fully analyzed by comparisons with those not considering heat transfer process then the effect of pbcl distribution is discussed which shows that the reasonable pbcl distribution can facilitate a more stable gliding attitude of pdg energy

field of oceanic environmental survey the oceangliders program started in 2016 to support active coordination and enhancement of global glider activity underwater gliders contribute to the international efforts of the global ocean observation system goos for climate ocean health and operational services testor et al 2019 with the progress of science and technology underwater exploration has become a research hotspot in recent years under this background underwater glider technology gets rapid development in 1989 henry stommel proposed the concept of underwater glider first stommel 1989 in the following decades many groups proposed their early underwater gliders such as slocum webb et al 2001 seaglider eriksen et al 2001 spray sherman et al 2001 and petrel wang et al 2011 the maximum working depth of the gliders listed above is 1500 m however the average depth of the global ocean is 3850 m therefore it is necessary to extend the observation depth of underwater gliders to a greater depth nowadays several deep sea gliders dgs have been developed such as the ultradeep explorer glider bridges 2016 the deepglider osse and eriksen 2007 the sea wing7000 glider yu et al 2017 and the petrel x glider wang et al 2019 their maximum working depths are 5000 m 6000 m 7000 m and 10 000 m respectively however environmental variations with seawater pressure temperature and density present great challenges for the operation of underwater gliders in the deep sea the hull deformation caused by seawater pressure and the variation in seawater density has a non negligible effect on the net buoyancy of underwater vehicles the net buoyancy variation degrades motion performance and makes it difficult for underwater gliders to dive deeper yang et al 2017 gao et al 2017 zhou et al 2020 specifically when underwater gliders need to submerge deeper their buoyancy control systems have to adjust a large amount of hydraulic oil which brings huge energy consumption and limits the duration and range of sailing therefore it is of practical significance to find an advanced approach that can compensate for the net buoyancy loss and reduce the energy consumption of the buoyancy control system to drive dg more efficiently various passive compensation approaches to minimize or adapt to the buoyancy variation with depth have been investigated or developed in the engineered and natural worlds tang et al 2018 designed a 1200 m depth neutrally buoyant pressure hull using bi directional evolutionary topology method to reduce the buoyancy loss yang et al 2020 designed a multiple intersecting spheres mis pressure hull to provide neutral buoyancy for a 1000 m depth underwater glider eriksen et al 2001 presented an isopycnal pressure hull designed for a 1000 m depth seaglider to match the compressibility of the vehicle to the seawater density variation observed over the operating depth of the vehicle however these materials and structures cannot effectively apply to the deep sea pressure jiang et al 2019 in the natural world many species of marine animals have their solutions to maintain neutral buoyancy benthic sharks use the large volumes of hydrocarbon squalene in their livers to regulate buoyancy corner et al 1969 some species of squid use ammonia rich solution to regulate buoyancy clarke et al 1979 the use of fluid buoyancy enables the compression of the system to match the increase of seawater density and achieve neutral buoyancy during descending and ascending however the thermal effect of the fluid is also a non negligible factor to buoyancy change the response of the liquid to pressure change is essentially instantaneous but its temperature change depends on the heat transfer rate between the exterior and interior of the marine animals upon surfacing their body would gradually warm up and its buoyancy would increase to the value at thermal equilibrium priede et al 2020 taking inspiration from nature phillips et al 2012 developed an isopycnal soft bodied autonomous underwater vehicle auv to tackle buoyancy variations the light mineral oil 69 05 of total volume filled inside its soft shell is more compressible than seawater and the batteries and internal structures are less compressible than seawater this passively maintains neutral buoyancy over 0 6000 m depth range furlong et al 2012 utilized high low pressure air compensators and silicon oil to reduce the buoyancy variation of the autosub lr auv within 6000 m depth wang et al 2019 proposed a novel full ocean depth glider carrying silicon oil for hadal observations which effectively enables dg to dive to 10 000 m due to the application of a large amount of liquid for buoyancy compensation underwater vehicles similar to those marine animals will also be exposed to temperature effects especially for those that need to achieve profile measurements repeatedly such as underwater gliders however few of the current studies focus on the application of pbcl to dg and it lacks a specific analysis of the impact of the heat transfer process on motion performance the first generation 4000 m dg designed and developed by tianjin university china was tested in the mariana trench in april 2018 the sea trial situation is shown in fig 1 the shell of the glider is made of titanium alloys which increases the ratio of weight to buoyancy therefore it is necessary to design a bigger size to increase buoyancy which leads to the mass 240 kg and volume of the glider far beyond the project design index and requires more pbcl 28 l in total to compensate for the net buoyancy loss in addition because of the large amount of pbcl it takes more heat transfer time to ensure sufficient thermal expansion for increasing the net buoyancy so when the glider approaches the sea surface a in fig 1 b it almost stops moving up therefore the heat transfer process of pbcl on motion performance is non negligible in the ocean environment dynamic modeling and motion behavior prediction of underwater gliders which are essential to maneuverability design motion performance and energy consumption optimization have been widely investigated the most famous and commonly used dynamic models of underwater gliders were derived by leonard and graver 2001 wang and wang 2009 woolsey 2011 thomasson and woolsey 2013 zhang et al 2013 wang et al 2014 fan and woolsey 2014 etc the environmentally induced parameter changes have also been introduced to these dynamic models a dynamic model for hybrid driven underwater glider considering the seawater density variation and hull deformation was established by yang et al 2017 which is more suitable for dg and helps effectively analyze the impact of buoyancy on motion performance with environmental parameter variation gao et al 2017 explained the gradual decrease of the dg pitch angle during the descent process by a nonlinear dynamic model based on kirchhoff s equations considering the hull deformation seawater temperature and density variations wang et al 2019 described the dynamic modeling and motion analysis for a dual buoyancy driven full ocean depth glider carrying pbcl by considering the environmental parameters and corresponding displaced volume change of the entire glider in the previous study carried out by wang et al 2019 the effect of pbcl on the reduction of dg buoyancy loss is studied and the buoyancy loss is reduced by 70 8 from 0 m to 10 000 m depth however the temperature of pbcl was treated consistent with the seawater temperature so the influence of the heat transfer process on motion performance and buoyancy change is yet to be clarified elevating energy efficiency is the key to increasing the underwater glider s endurance and expanding its sailing range zhou et al 2020 furthermore in the analysis of energy consumption of dg the effects of environmental parameter variation and the heat transfer process of pbcl on energy consumption cannot be ignored consequently the energy consumption model cannot be established based on steady motion models song et al 2020 yang et al 2019 additionally the underwater glider is the ideal platform to carry out observation missions in the ocean environment a comprehensive and precise understanding of their velocity trajectory and buoyancy is of vital importance for design and operation of underwater gliders underwater gliders can be equipped with various oceanographic optical and acoustic payloads which may have specific requirements for motion performance of the gliders peterson and fer 2014 palmer et al 2015 todd et al 2017 stinco et al 2020 some important parameters of the marine environment can also be derived with the dynamic model of the glider such as internal wave and vertical water velocities rudnick et al 2013 merckelbach et al 2010 2019 frajka williams et al 2011 the heat transfer process of pbcl affects net buoyancy of the dg in dynamics and then affects dynamic behaviors of the dg in addition the heat transfer process is further related to the gliding velocity and trajectory of the dg therefore it is essential to establish a more accurate dynamic model for the dg carrying pbcl considering the heat transfer process in the real ocean environment the present work focuses on the improved 4000 m petrel 4000 dg developed by tianjin university firstly a comprehensive dynamic thermal model considering the heat transfer process of pbcl is built in the real ocean environment to estimate the motion performance and buoyancy change of the vehicle then the accuracy of the model is verified by comparing the simulation data with the experimental data additionally the effect of the heat transfer process of pbcl on dynamic behaviors of the glider is discussed in detail by comparisons with those not considering heat transfer process and then the effect of pbcl distribution is discussed finally energy consumption analysis is carried out by disassembling a profile 2 mathematical models 2 1 configuration of petrel 4000 deep sea glider this article takes the petrel 4000 deep sea glider carrying pbcl designed independently by tianjin university as the object of study detailed design specifications of the pdg are given in table 1 and its geometry is shown in fig 2 the pdg has a torpedo shape similar to the legacy gliders the buoyancy can be easily affected by the seawater density variation and the density of seawater varies with temperature salinity and pressure which vary in different seas yang et al 2017 considering this the pdg is designed to be propelled by the electro hydraulic buoyancy control system with pbcl the pbcl is filled in the hollow cylindrical and flexible containers which are located in the fore and aft fairings respectively the schematic diagram of the pbcl is shown in fig 3 the motion process of a gliding profile of the glider is similar to that of the petrel l glider described by a previous research yang et al 2019 when the pdg moves up or down in the water column the mass of pbcl remains constant in the short term irrespective of the negligible leakage but the density volume changes from the initial value in response to pressure and temperature variation when the pdg moves up to the shallow warm water layer the temperature of seawater is higher than that of pbcl the pbcl absorbs heat from the ocean and the environmental pressure is reduced thus the volume of pbcl expands after its net buoyancy changes from positive to negative on the sea surface the pdg begins to dive when the pdg moves down to the deep cold water layer the pbcl releases heat to the ocean and the environmental pressure is increased which causes cooling and contracting of the pbcl the volume change rate of the pbcl during ascent and descent processes decides the net buoyancy of the pdg accordingly the heat transfer process of pbcl will affect the motion performance of the pdg 2 2 environment model the pdg descends and ascends between sea surface and 4000 m depth temperature pressure and density of the seawater change with depth as observed by pdg in the south china sea density is derived with basic temperature salinity and pressure parameters fig 4 according to the equation of state of seawater here this paper employs the high pressure equation of the 1980 international equation of state of seawater eos 80 fofonoff and millard 1983 millero et al 1980 the temperature t sea and density ρ sea of seawater from the sea surface down to 4000 m can be described by the following quartic polynomial formulas yang et al 2017 2019 1 t sea a 1 h 6 a 2 h 5 a 3 h 4 a 4 h 3 a 5 h 2 a 6 h a 7 2 ρ sea b 1 h 6 b 2 h 5 b 3 h 4 b 4 h 3 b 5 h 2 b 6 h b 7 the values of fitting coefficients a i i 1 7 and b i i 1 7 are listed in table 2 the pressure is related to the density of seawater and the depth as follows 3 p ρ sea h g p 0 where h is the depth p 0 is the standard atmospheric pressure p 0 1 01325 105 pa and g is the acceleration of gravity which varies little with the latitude and depth and thus is considered as 9 8 kg m3 jiang et al 2019 2 3 kinematic and dynamic models of pdg in this paper the equations to describe the motion of the pdg are established in a body fixed frame o xyz while the trajectory is expressed in the earth fixed frame e xyz the body fixed frame o xyz is established at the center of buoyancy of the glider the x axis coincides with the longitudinal axis of the glider the z axis lies in the wing plane pointing to right when viewed along the direction of x the y axis is selected by x z the coordinate systems are shown in fig 2 the forces acting on the pdg include hydrodynamic forces and moments gravity and buoyancy moreover the center of gravity cg does not coincide with the center of buoyancy cb so a moment of the gravity is generated on the center of buoyancy in addition to the net buoyancy and hydrodynamic forces to obtain a dynamic model for the pdg the momentum theorem and the moment of momentum theorem are applied in the body fixed frame lyu et al 2019 4 d p d t ω p f d l d t ω l v p m where p and l represent the momentum and moment of momentum respectively f and m are forces and

when there is roll motion it is also assumed that j xy j yz j xz 0 as they are too small to affect the results compared with j x j y and j z thus their corresponding terms are eliminated and the

are calculated by combining eqs 14 17 and expressed by predefined parameters or variables the buoyancy of the pdg b is mainly provided by the pressure hull oil bladder and pbcl as 19 b b h b e b cl where b h b e and b cl represent the buoyancy of the pressure hull oil bladder and pbcl respectively since both seawater density and pressure change with depth the buoyancy of the hull can be

motion of the pdg in the longitudinal plane table 3 lists the main geometrics parameters related to pbcl hydrodynamics coefficients the added mass and inertia matrix of the pdg 2 4 thermal model the pbcl is filled in two hollow cylindrical and flexible containers inside the fairings of pdg as shown in fig 3 the glider will confront a variable thermal environment from the sea surface to the target depth the external heat flux involves the convective heat transfer between the outer hull and seawater inside the liquid heat fluxes include the natural convection and heat conduction in order to establish the thermal model of pbcl the following conditions are assumed a the pbcl is homogeneous and isotropic and thermal conductivity along the axis direction of the hollow cylindrical vessel can be ignored b the specific capacity and thermal conductivity of the pbcl are constant and independent of temperature and pressure c the effect of natural convection during the heat transfer process is considered by introducing the effective conductivity the heat transfer process is mainly controlled by heat conduction d the contact resistance of different interfaces in the heat transfer process is neglected this section mainly deals with the law of volume change during the heat transfer process and the velocity profile of pbcl is not a focus here which however does influence the heat transfer process therefore the effective thermal conductivity k eff is induced to express the influence of natural convection of the pbcl during the heat transfer process ismail and abugderah 2000 hirata and nishida 1989 thus the energy conservation equation can be written as 24 t t k eff ρ cl c p cl 2 t r 2 1 r t r where c p cl is the specific capacity of pbcl r is the radius ρ cl is the density of pbcl t is the temperature and k eff is the effective thermal conductivity as 25 k eff t 0 228 r a l t 1 4 1 d t d 1 4 k cl where ra l is rayleigh number d is the inner diameter of the cylinder d is the outer diameter of the cylinder and k cl is the thermal conductivity of pbcl energy equations for the wall of the fairings and containers are 26 t t k f ρ f c p f 2 t r 2 1 r t r t t k c ρ c c p c 2 t r 2 1 r t r where k f and k c are the thermal conductivity ρ f and ρ c are the density c p f and c p c are the specific capacity of the fairings and containers respectively when operating in the real ocean environment dgs will experience buoyancy variation with depth due to pressure hull deformation and seawater density variation yang et al 2017 gao et al 2017 similarly the pdg moves up and down in the ocean at a variable speed the external convective heat transfer between the outer surface of the fairing and seawater can be forced convection the heat transfers from the seawater to the hull and fairing by convection the boundary condition is as follows 27 k f t r 0 t r h c t r 0 t t sea t where r 0 is the outer radius of the fairing and h c is the convection coefficient 28 h c k s n u l

number and pr is prandtl number of seawater the fairing and pbcl are in direct touch with the container thus continuous boundary conditions are also defined herein supposing that the pbcl flow is nearly negligible at the same time finally the equations set on the continuous boundary conditions are expressed below 30 t f r r 1 t c r r 1 k f t r r r 1 k c t r r r 1 t c r r 2 t cl r r 2 k c t r r

pbcl in the beginning the glider is assumed at a stable thermal equilibrium state on the sea surface the initial temperatures of fairing container and pbcl are equal to the seawater temperature t sea0 then the initial condition is 31 t r 0 t t sea0 the main thermal parameters related to pbcl are listed in table 3 2 5 numerical model of pbcl volume change during the heat transfer process when the pdg moves up or down in the water column irrespective of the negligible pbcl leakage in the short term the mass of pbcl remains constant but the density changes from the initial value in response to pressure and temperature variation a simple experiment is put forward to test the pressure temperature and density ptd of pbcl during the heat transfer process the ptd relationship is measured using a hydraulic cylinder enclosed within a temperature controlled water tank a high pressure hydraulic pump applies the pressure a schematic diagram of the experimental apparatus is shown in fig 5 the experimental system can be divided into a pressure control unit and a temperature control and density measurement unit the pressure control unit consists of a high pressure hydraulic pump 3 to provide constant pressure load a low pressure hydraulic pump 1 to ensure the inlet pressure of the high pressure hydraulic pump overflow valves 4 and 5 to maintain the constant pressure a filter 2 a pressure sensor 6 a one way valve 7 a hand valve 8 and an oil tank 9 the temperature control and density measurement unit includes a hydraulic cylinder 11 to measure the volume variation of the pbcl a displacement sensor 12 a water tank 14 to provide a suitable environment temperature for the hydraulic cylinder a water temperature controller 13 to control the environment temperature around the hydraulic cylinder and a pressure sensor 10 to measure the pressure of the pbcl since the pbcl is stored in the rod chamber of the hydraulic cylinder its volume variation can be recorded indirectly by recording the piston rod displacement of the hydraulic cylinder when reaching thermal equilibrium ascending pressure increments are applied allowing sufficient time to stabilize at each new pressure when the piston rod of the hydraulic cylinder does not move the sampling process can be considered as completed liquid density as a function of pressure and temperature can be fitted with a linear polynomial equation zhang et al 2020 wang et al 2020 the density of pbcl is defined as 32 ρ cl 9 023 10 7 p 1 038 t 1085 0 to analyze the volume change of pbcl a number of nodes with an equal interval are designed in the radial direction of the pbcl region and the positions of nodes are shown in fig 6 the change rate of volume i relative to the volume of original pbcl at time step j is 33 φ i j δ v cl i j v cl0 1 ρ cl i j 1 ρ cl i j 1 ρ cl 0 m i m cl where δv cl i j is the volume change of i at time step j m i is the mass of volume i m cl is the total mass of pbcl ρ cl0 and v cl0 represent the density and volume of pbcl on the sea surface respectively and ρ cl i j is the average density of volume i at time step j 34 m i m cl ρ cl i j 1 r i j 1 2 r i 1 j 1 2 ρ cl0 r 2 2 r 3 2 where r i j is the interface diameter of the adjacent nodes i and i 1 at time step j and r 3 is the inner radius of pbcl equation 33 can be simplified as 35 φ i j ρ cl i j 1 ρ cl i j 1 r i j 1 2 r i 1 j 1 2 r 2 2 r

6 simulation method the dynamic eq 7 is a typical ordinary differential equation the standard fourth order runge kutta method can be applied to discretize the dynamic equation liu 2014 wu et al 2020 equations 24 26 and 27 are partial differential equations and the finite difference method is used in this paper kong et al 2010 xia et al 2018 based on the discrete equations expressed above a program is developed with matlab to simulate the gliding motion performance of the pdg and the volume change of the pbcl as illustrated in fig 7 the framework of the process is divided into two modules the trajectory calculation module takes hydrodynamic performance parameters of buoyancy control and pitch control system and volume of the pbcl as input by solving the kinematic and dynamic equations the motion parameters are obtained as output the thermal calculation module begins with the environment model and thermal parameters and ends with the output of pbcl volume by solving the thermal equations for better understanding of the performance simulation program for the glider the pseudo code of the program is elaborated in algorithm 1 since this paper focuses on the transient behavior of heat transport of the pbcl during the ascent and descent processes for the sake of simplicity and clarity the processes of buoyancy control and pitch control are not considered and thus the constant buoyancy and distance travelled by the battery package are predefined as in the following numerical simulation algorithm 1 pseudo code for the performance simulation of the glider image 1 3 sea trial experimental validation in order to evaluate the accuracy of the models dynamic behaviors of the pdg predicted by the simulation results are compared with those in the sea trials the sea trials were conducted around 18 11 n and 116 10 e in the south china sea a series of gliding experiments have been performed fig 8 shows the experimental prototype and the motion path of pdg a ctd sensor idronaut r s l os304plus was mounted to measure the operating depth conductivity and temperature the measured depth rate was used to estimate the vertical velocity of pdg the attitude angles of the glider roll yaw and pitch were measured by a tcm3 digital compass pni sensor corporation two profiles a and b are selected for comparison the target depths of the two profiles are both 3200 m correspondingly the distances l b travelled by the movable battery package are set 16 mm and 19 mm for profile a and 15 mm and 19 mm for profile b during descending and ascending respectively the volume fractions of the hydraulic oil in the oil tank are set 94 and 3 during descending and ascending respectively after completing each profile the pdg waited on the sea surface for approximately an hour to allow the pbcl to get the same temperature with the seawater the area between the two blue dotted lines in fig 9 the simulation results and the experimental results are shown in fig 9 the gliding depths of the glider from the simulation results and the sea trials are shown in fig 9 a the maximum error of depth between simulation and the sea trials is 46 m for profile a and 24 m for profile b respectively within the same simulation time the comparison of the pitch angles obtained from the simulation results and sea trials is shown in fig 9 b the previous experimental results obtained in the real ocean environment show that the pitch angle decreases with depth in both ascending and descending processes yang et al 2017 gao et al 2017 different from this the pitch angle from sea trials data firstly increases and then decreases with depth in the descending process and decreases with depth in the ascending process for profile a the pitch angle increases from 20 to 22 and back to 18 in gliding descent and decreases from 22 to 15 in gliding ascent the variation trend of pitch angle from the simulation results is consistent with that in the sea trials the pitch angle increases from 19 8 to 22 5 and back to 18 9 in gliding descent and decreases from 22 7 to 14 5 in gliding ascent for profile b the pitch angle obtained from sea trials increases from 17 to 20 and back to 16 in gliding descent and decreases from 22 to 15 in gliding ascent the variation trend of pitch angle from the simulation results is consistent with that in the sea trials the pitch angle increases from 17 6 to 20 5 and back to 16 8 in gliding descent and decreases from 22 7 to 14 5 in gliding ascent the maximum errors of pitch angle between the simulation results and the sea trials are both less than 2 in the near steady gliding stage the simulation results can reflect the variation trend of the pitch angle from sea trials in addition in the communication and waiting phase the area between the two blue dotted lines in fig 9 the trailing antenna emerges from the sea surface and the magnitude of pitch angle shall be larger than 45 to facilitate the communication yang et al 2019 in the practical operation the glider is affected by the waves on the sea surface so the pitch angle experiences large fluctuations these situations are not considered in the simulation c in fig 9 b fig 9 c compares vertical gliding velocities obtained from the simulation results and sea trials in sea trials the vertical velocity shows a similar variation trend with the pitch angle in gliding descent the vertical velocity from sea trials changes from 0 25 to 0 15 m s for profile a and changes from 0 23 to 0 13 m s for profile b in gliding ascent the vertical velocity from sea trials changes from 0 25 to 0 12 m s for both profiles a and b the maximum deviations of vertical velocity between the simulation results and sea trials in the two profiles are both less than 0 05 m s in near steady gliding stage the variation trends of vertical velocity for the two profiles achieved in the simulation are the same as those achieved in sea trials several factors may have contributed to the discrepancies between experimental results and simulation results firstly it may be attributed to the several assumptions and simplifications of the thermal model in the heat transfer process as mentioned above secondly there may be a certain amount of gas dissolved in the pbcl which can be easily compressed according to bayes theory when the pressure is ten times the initial pressure the gas volume becomes one tenth of the original therefore when the glider actually dives to merely 100 m the net buoyancy changes dramatically during this process as a result there are large discrepancies in motion performance near the sea surface thirdly the control parameter errors include the error of net buoyancy adjustment amount and that of movable battery package displacement amount which can also cause great motion deviations wu et al 2020 finally the diving preparation phase and the climbing preparation phase are relatively short in the whole profile since this paper mainly focuses on the pitch angle and velocity of the whole gliding process these complex and short phases are neglected during the simulation to simplify the dynamic model from the above analysis the dynamic and thermal models established in the present work are proven to be effective and credible and can precisely predict dynamic behaviors of the glider 4 results and discussions 4 1 effect of the heat transfer process of pbcl in order to further verify the effect of the heat transfer process of pbcl this study compares dynamic behaviors of the pdg predicted by the dynamic thermal model hereinafter referred to as the dt model and those predicted by a conventional dynamic model hereinafter referred to as the d model without considering the heat transfer process of pbcl this section mainly analyzes the gliding motion process a single profile the distance l b travelled by the movable battery package is set 16 mm and 19 mm in the gliding descent and ascent respectively the volume fraction of the hydraulic oil in the oil tank is 94 and 3 in gliding descent and ascent respectively the simulation time for the descent process is set 15 800 s the simulation results are shown in fig 10 fig 10 a c illustrate the gliding trajectories depths and voyages predicted by dt model and d model it can be seen that the gliding trajectory predicted by dt model is not parallel with that by d model both in the gliding descent from 0 m to 2000 m and gliding ascent from 1000 m to 0 m especially in the former the maximum depth and voyage predicted by d model are 3461 m and 16 298 m respectively which are 296 m and 652 m larger than those by dt model fig 10 d illustrates the pitch angles predicted by dt model and d model which show different variation trends in the gliding descent from 50 m to 2000 m the pitch angle of the glider with dt model is always less than the one with d model and the difference between them firstly increases to a maximum value of 5 4 and then decreases in the gliding descent from 2000 m to the deepest depth and the gliding ascent from the deepest depth to 1000 m the pitch angles of the glider with dt model and d model are almost equal in the gliding ascent from 1000 m to 50 m the pitch angles have the same variation trend with the gliding descent from 50 m to 2000m with a maximum difference of 6 1 fig 10 e and f show the vertical and horizontal velocities in the earth fixed frame predicted by dt model and d model which show a similar variation trend with the pitch angles in the gliding descent and ascent the maximum difference of the vertical velocities is 0 10 m s and 0 07 m s respectively it can be seen from fig 4 that density variation and temperature variation of seawater are greater at a depth of less than 300 m to emphasize the influence of the heat transfer process velocity fluctuations from 300 m to 3000 m are discussed in the gliding descent the variation range of vertical velocity with dt model is from 0 17 to 0 23 m s and the one with d model is from 0 17 to 0 29 m s in the gliding ascent the variation range of vertical velocity with dt model is from 0 13 to 0 25 m s and the one with d model is from 0 12 to 0 25 m s it is clear from fig 10 f that the trends of horizontal velocities are same with those of vertical velocities in dt model and d model moreover the maximum difference of the horizontal velocities is 0 12 m s and 0 15 m s in the gliding descent and ascent respectively in summary it can be seen that the variation magnitudes of the pitch angle the vertical velocity and the horizontal velocity with d model are larger than their counterparts with dt model in the gliding descent and smaller in the gliding ascent the phenomenon that the gliding trajectories pitch angles and velocities from dt model are different from those from d model can be attributed to the variation of net buoyancy caused by the heat transfer process of pbcl the temperature is generally higher on the sea surface which decreases rapidly in the range of 40 m 400 m depth commonly called thermocline and then falls slowly below the thermocline fig 4 a when the water depth is greater than 1500 m the temperature is almost constant thereafter the volume change of the pbcl is only affected by the pressure the temperature and volume of pbcl in dt model and d model are shown in fig 11 the temperature of the pbcl is consistent with that of the seawater in the d model however influenced by the heat transfer process of pbcl the temperature change of pbcl lags behind that of seawater as shown in fig 11 a which will also lead to different volumes of pbcl during the descent and ascent in the two models as shown in fig 11 b thus in the dt model that considers the time required by the heat transfer process of pbcl buoyancy changes are delayed for a certain amount of time which will result in a difference in buoyancy with d model fig 12 it can be seen from fig 12 that during the descent the glider has sufficient time to synchronize the temperatures of the pbcl and the seawater however during the ascent when the temperature of the pbcl is lower than that of the seawater especially when the glider traverses the thermocline it leaves less time for the glider to complete the synchronization of temperature upon surfacing the glider would gradually warm up and its buoyancy would increase to the value at thermal equilibrium that s why the glider in fig 1 b almost stopped moving up as it approached the sea surface the pitch angle and velocity of the glider mainly depend on the net buoyancy and the distance l b travelled by the movable battery package liu 2014 yang et al 2017 with the same l b the pitch angle and velocity change with the net buoyancy therefore the pitch angle and velocity of the glider with both dt model and d model change continuously fig 10 d f following the variation trend of net buoyancy of the pdg fig 12 in brief the heat transfer process of pbcl has a significant effect on the net buoyancy variation and motion performance of pdg especially when it passes through a water column with a large temperature difference 4 2 effect of the pbcl distribution the three elements of force are magnitude direction and point of action and the change in the magnitude of the net buoyancy caused by pbcl is accompanied by a change in the point of action caused by pbcl distribution from fig 9 b when other parameters of the two profiles are identical the magnitude of the pitch angle of profile a is 2 larger than that of profile b in gliding descent which is because the distance l b travelled by the movable battery package of profile a is greater than that of profile b namely that the center of gravity of profile a is farther to the original point in the body fixed frame than that of profile b thus the change in the center of gravity caused by pbcl also influences motion performance according to eqs 13 14 and 17 the change in center of gravity caused by pbcl is calculated under the same set of control parameter values of profile a in section 3 fig 13 shows the position change of the center of gravity caused by pbcl with dt model in the body fixed frame at a depth of 3200 m pbcl distribution brings about 1 27 mm forward movement of the center of gravity which is equivalent to the effect of 9 mm forward movement of the battery package the forward movement and backward movement of the center of gravity in the gliding descent and ascent will increase pitch angle which will counteract the decrease of the pitch angle caused by the decrease of the net buoyancy however due to the influence of time delay caused by the heat transfer process of pbcl the relative change of the center of gravity in the descending process is greater than the one in the ascending process for conventional underwater gliders without pbcl feedback control of the glider is intermittently performed to keep the target pitch angle the pitch angle variation can be minimized by employing a closed loop pitch angle control or setting a lower limit touching which the pitch angle is adjusted by moving the battery package yang et al 2017 gao et al 2017 wu et al 2020 therefore during the adjustment the pitch angle will change dramatically however the utilization of pbcl effectively mitigates this phenomenon with which a continuous change of pitch angle can be achieved to study the influence of pbcl distribution on the pitch angle the distances l f and l a of pbcl are both set to range from 0 85 m to 1 05 m in 0 05 m increments in the rest of this section the distance l b travelled by the movable battery package is set 16 mm and 19 mm in gliding descent and ascent respectively the volume fraction of the oil in the oil tank is set 94 and 3 in gliding descent and ascent respectively the target depth is 4000 m the magnitude of pitch angle variation obtained from the simulation results is shown in fig 14 the pbcl distribution shows an obvious impact on the change of the pitch angle the magnitudes of pitch angle variation are 1 6 and 4 8 in the descent and ascent stages when the fore and aft distances of the pbcl are set 1 05 m and 0 85 m respectively under the same condition the magnitude of pitch angle variation in the ascent process is larger than that in the descent process and the trends of the variation are same in both processes in summary the pbcl distribution has a significant influence on the change of pitch angle which can facilitate a more stable gliding attitude of pdg and be adjustable according to the requirements of the task for example some sensors require specific pitch angles of the glider to ensure the measurement accuracy such as microrider peterson and fer 2014 palmer et al 2015 4 3 energy saving with pbcl at present the underwater glider is mainly supplied by the battery to carry out its mission furthermore in the analysis of energy consumption of underwater glider the effect of net buoyancy variation on energy consumption cannot be ignored in addition this paper does not consider the specific control process it only focuses on adjustment of the distance l b travelled by the movable battery package and volume fraction of the hydraulic oil in the oil tank to the target values in theory the whole motion process of the glider is periodic zigzag motion the energy consumption of whole motion process can be calculated by that of a single profile song et al 2020 wu et al 2021 yang et al 2019 the energy is consumed by control system measurement system buoyancy control system attitude control system and communication system in the gliding motion process in a single profile the control system and measurement system are constantly working therefore their energy consumption is closely related to the motion time t m which can be obtained by dynamic simulation the energy consumption of the attitude control system e p and that of the communication system e c in the communication phase for a single profile are referred to as constants the buoyancy control system is activated twice in a gliding cycle once in the diving preparation phase and once in the climbing preparation phase in the diving preparation phase the hydraulic oil is pressed by atmospheric pressure to flow from the external oil bladder into the internal oil tank when the solenoid valve works the power and flow rate of the solenoid valve are denoted as p v and q v respectively in the climbing preparation phase the hydraulic oil is pumped into the external oil bladder the power and flow rate of the hydraulic pump are denoted as p p and q p respectively in the diving and climbing phases the energy is consumed by the control system and measurement system consequently the total energy consumption e a in a single profile can be calculated as 38 e a p m t m 1000 v 1 p v 1000 q v v 2 p p 1000 q p e p e c where v 1 is the volume of hydraulic oil pressed back into the internal oil tank v 2 is the volume of hydraulic oil pumped into the external oil bladder and p m is the average power of the control system and measurement system which ranges from 0 5 w to 5 w then the average energy utilization rate ξ of the glider is defined as wu et al 2021 39 ξ x a e a where x a is the displacement of pdg in horizontal direction in a single profile obtained by dynamic simulation and ξ is the voyage powered by 1 kj energy a larger ξ represents a higher energy utilization rate of the glider this paper takes the maximum design depth 4000 m as a case to study the energy saving effect of the glider with pbcl the key parameters of the energy consumption model are shown in table 4 measured by experiments in order to discuss the motion performance and energy consumption of pbcl equipped glider in a real ocean environment simulations are established under two conditions condition a the glider operating with the pbcl and condition b the glider operating without the pbcl the same operation objectives need to be specified to make a fair comparison of energy consumption two volumes of hydraulic oil for diving are set to ensure that the glider can reach same net buoyancy at a maximum depth 4000 m under conditions a and b condition a adopts the same set of control parameters of profile a in section 3 in contrast the hydraulic oil volume v 2 of condition b is 1 5 l larger than that of condition a fig 15 shows the comparison results of the motion process under conditions a and b as shown in fig 15 a compared with condition b the glider with the pbcl under condition a takes almost twice the time for total motion process this is because when carrying the pbcl the glider has a lower average net buoyancy during the motion process fig 15 b shows the displacement of pdg in the horizontal direction the displacement under condition a is larger than that under condition b since the average pitch angle is smaller when pbcl is carried fig 15 c shows the pitch angle variation when the displacement of the movable battery package is set to remain stationary the change in net buoyancy under condition a will affect the stabilization of pitch angle the introduction of the pbcl effectively reduces the variation range of pitch angle which can help maintain the stability of the glider s attitude fig 15 d shows that the vertical velocity change is consistent with the pitch angle variation it is clear that the pbcl has an important contribution to reducing the change of pitch angle and vertical velocity according to eqs 38 and 49 2 of the energy consumption of the buoyancy control system can be saved by employing pbcl although the motion time of condition a has been extended 44 7 the gliding range with the p m of 2 w still increases by 44 3 compared with that under condition b fig 16 shows the increasing rate of the gliding range after adopting pbcl when the average power of the control system and measurement system p m ranges from 0 5 w to 5 w the increasing rate of the gliding range decreases as the average power p m increases which is because the total energy saving of the glider is also related to the total motion time although the energy consumption caused by the heavy load at high pressure is contracted by the adoption of pbcl other glider units still consume too much energy leading to an increase in overall energy consumption of the glider in a longer total motion time therefore in order to reduce the energy consumption of the glider it is necessary to appropriately decrease the average power of the control system and measurement system 5 conclusions in this work a comprehensive dynamic thermal model considering the heat transfer process of pbcl is proposed for the pdg kinematic and dynamic simulations are carried out with the proposed model the simulation results show good consistency with sea trial data which validates the proposed model then the effects of the heat transfer process and distribution of pbcl on the pdg in the real ocean environment as well as the energy saving effect are simulated and analyzed the following conclusions can be drawn from this work 1 the effect of the heat transfer process of pbcl is non negligible buoyancy changes caused by pbcl are delayed for a certain amount of time greatly influencing the descending depth pitch angle and vertical velocity of the pdg especially as the pdg passes through the water column with a large temperature difference in the descent process besides for the deep sea gliders with pbcl the buoyancy variation would make it difficult for them to ascend when approaching the sea surface 2 the pbcl can compensate for the net buoyancy loss and obtain a more stable gliding attitude of the pdg the distribution of the pbcl shows a significant impact on the pitch angle variation and increasing the ratio of fore distance to aft distance can reduce the magnitude of pitch angle variation the minimum magnitude is 1 6 and 4 8 in the descent and ascent process respectively 3 49 2 of the energy consumption of the buoyancy control can be saved when the pdg is equipped with pbcl which is effective to increase the gliding range the enhancing effect is more obvious with the decrease in the average power of the control system and measurement system though proposed for petrel 4000 deep sea glider the comprehensive dynamic thermal model applies to simulation and design analysis of other deep sea gliders further research will be carried out to enhance the performance of deep sea gliders with pbcl the next step is to explore the control strategy that simultaneously ensures the

20208,the use of vertical axis turbines in marine current applications for electric energy generation is still in early developments and one of the key factors for assessing the applicability of such technology is the power coefficient to contribute towards the highly competitive market of renewable energy conversions the turbine system requires good outcomes in terms of energy yield in this scenario one of the main challenges regarding the design process to improve the blade performance is to find the best trade off between the maximization of the power output and the minimization of the structural loadings in the current work the influence of blade pitch angles on the hydrodynamics of a vertical axis five blade water turbine has been studied the pitch angles from 5 to 5 were investigated using computational fluid dynamics cfd the simulations were validated against experimental data for the power coefficient collected in a river overall a good agreement was found in terms of computed power between simulations and experiments for a wide range of tip speed ratios the cfd model was proven to be suitable for exploratory analyses and an optimized design was found providing a 2 3 higher power coefficient by adopting a pitch angle of 2 compared to the zero referenced pitch angle besides validating with the experiment the cfd simulations were compared with the results of a vortex model the effect of different pitch angles on the performance prediction and on the blade and turbine loadings was also discussed it is becoming vital to develop an understanding of the complex interaction of vertical axis turbines especially in tidal current areas where there is a lack of detailed experimental data keywords vertical axis marine current turbine pitch angle optimization power coefficient normal force tangential force hydrodynamics cfd 1 introduction 1 1 background the global community and more locally europe aim to be climate neutral by 2050 council 2050 to this end marine current energy extraction has gained a greater interest as a possible alternative energy resource various types of marine current energy converters have been developed to extract electrical energy from the tidal energy resource in general three technologies are utilized to convert tidal currents into mechanical energy to produce electricity horizontal axis turbines vertical axis turbines and oscillating hydrofoils energy 2019 maldar et al 2020 yuce and muratoglu 2015 among these technologies the horizontal axis marine current turbines hamts are more developed and can be utilized to obtain a large quantity of energy from marine currents this technology accounts for 76 of r d efforts in the development of tidal devices worldwide government 2015 by contrast the vertical axis turbines in marine current applications are in primary developments fig 1 shows the number of publications involving vertical axis tidal turbines and compares it to the corresponding wind projects the results were achieved by searching elsevier s abstract database in scopus and show that the published papers currently on the vertical axis marine current turbines vamts are approximately 7 compared to the vertical axis wind turbines vawts although vertical axis tidal machines and wind machines have a similar working principle in generating electricity a specific challenge in setting up experimental facilities to assess the turbine performance when using man made environments i e tanks tunnels is related to the interaction between flow and boundaries in constrained conditions the boundaries can alter the characteristics of the flow field therefore the result of experimental water tanks data may lead to errors that cannot be neglected a few studies have indicated that tank tests lead to solid blockage effects as well as scale problem due to a spatially restricted domain garrett and cummins 2007 whelan and grahamjp 2020 bahaj et al 2007 kolekar and banerjee 2015 to address these limitations experimental performance should be characterized at real sites without blockage effects for one type of vertical axis turbines a real scale field test was conducted by sandia national laboratories in 1981 that investigated the effects of blade pitch for wind turbines klimas and worstell 1981 for tidal applications an open site test was carried out by nihon university in 1996 and it still represents a useful benchmark for validating numerical works kiho et al 1996 therefore there is a lack of validation data to support numerical simulations of straight bladed darrieus tidal turbines the challenges in the marine current application mentioned above have become one of the motivations for the marine current research group at uppsala university to create a project to perform experiments in a river yuen et al 2007 lundin et al 2015 grabbe et al 2013a in 2013 a prototype of the vertical axis water turbine was deployed in the open research site of the river dalälven the flow range of the river was suitable for research purposes and allowed to characterize the turbine for a wide range of tip speed ratios the full scale test has been performed for the turbine with the zero reference pitch in 2016 lundin et al 2016 the possibility of enhancing the turbine performance will be investigated in the current study with the main focus of finding the optimal balance between power output and blade loadings due to hydrodynamic forces acting on the rotor 1 2 previous studies on pitch optimization vertical axis turbines have been facing major challenges in establishing themselves in the renewable energy scenario if compared to horizontal axis turbines the main reason is related to the relatively lower efficiency due to the intrinsic functioning principle as they can reach power coefficients up to 30 50 moreover the turbine is not always capable of self starting and often relies on a starting mechanism according to the current standard regarding the performance optimization of darrieus rotors the main geometrical design parameters typically involved are the airfoil de tavernier et al 2019 the blade pitch angle bianchini et al 2015 the number of blades solidity rezaeiha et al 2018 the turbine aspect ratio as well as the use of external components such as deflectors and ducts alidadi 2004 among these options the pitch angle optimization seems the simplest in terms of constructions within the present study a detailed review on blade pitch optimization for vertical axis turbines was carried out by the authors upon examination of the several works 22 publications identified in the technical literature some general considerations can be outlined as follows pitch optimization is usually carried out by focusing the analysis on the maximization of the turbine efficiency while the modification in terms of aerodynamic hydrodynamic loadings is mostly neglected this can be tolerable for vawt since when dealing with a low density fluid at high rotational speeds the centrifugal force is dominant for the structural resistance of the machine conversely when dealing with water the situation becomes more critical since the hydrodynamic loads become more relevant and particular attention must be paid to the analysis of the forces acting on both the blades and the central shaft an active control of the pitch angle throughout the revolution is theoretically the most effective solution paraschivoiu et al 2009 kirke and lazauskas 2011 however it implies a significant increase of the turbine complexity particularly the authors believe that fixed pitch for underwater applications is most realistic since a pitching mechanism is complicated combined with problems such as biofouling and subject to much larger stresses than in case of air operation and maintenance of the pitch mechanism would also be more complicated for an underwater application the optimal fixed pitch angle will depend on multiple design parameters such as blade profile reynolds number turbine solidity number of blades etc still making it an open question and the outcome may be different for different turbines the difficulty of performing underwater tests has led to a lack of experimental data as well as optimization of water turbines which limit further development and application of such devices a more extensive overview of the selected studies is given in table 1 where the works are classified in terms of main geometrical features of the turbine optimal pitch and type of application upon examination of table 1 it is apparent that most of the works have been carried out for turbines having 2 or 3 blades and operating at low reynolds below 106 since the working fluid is usually air and the radius of the rotor is usually less than 1 m the validation studies for vertical axis turbines especially in marine current application are mostly from man made environments such as tanks the common range of investigated pitch angles is up to 8 values and the optimum is case dependent it can be finally concluded that there is room for further investigation on the impact of the blade pitch for different geometrical and operating conditions as well as to further increase the knowledge concerning the fluctuating loadings which are essential to assess the life expectancy of the turbine 1 3 validation data and motivation for the current study the present activity aims at analyzing the case of a five blade marine turbine operating at high reynolds above 106 thus representing a not commonly studied solution according to the formerly published works a full scale reference rotor was investigated in a river by the marine current research group of uppsala university all the details can be found in refs yuen et al 2007 lundin et al 2015 grabbe et al 2013b in which an extensive collection of experimental data is also provided the main features of the project however are summarized as follows a prototype of the vertical axis water turbine with a rated power of 7 5 kw was deployed in 2013 at the open research site of the river dalälven which has a 7 m depth and is located at a distance of 70 km north of uppsala university fig 2 the five blade turbine was placed 800 m downstream of a conventional hydropower plant that could keep the water velocity constant during the test the turbine was equipped with a 112 pole direct drive permanent magnet synchronous generator that has an 87 efficiency at nominal condition grabbe et al 2013a the generator was mounted on a tripod foundation of the turbine in water while the control system consisted of starting circuits and resistive loads was placed in an inland cabin the river water velocity was suitable for research purposes which allowed to investigate the turbine operation for a wide range of tip speed ratios the water speed was measured at 2 3 turbine diameters upstream and downstream of the turbine by acoustic doppler current profiles adcp the collected values during one year which mostly varied between 0 7 and 1 5 m s are shown in fig 3 a the velocity profile in the vertical direction against the river depth is presented in fig 3b it should be noted that the adcp only is reliable up to 1 m from the surface hence the shape seen close to the surface can be attributed to measurement errors the largest portion of the blade span operates at nominal speed while only in proximity of blade tips the velocity reduction is larger than 10 such reduction is supposed not to have a big impact on the performance due to the intrinsic tip loss experienced lateral variation of flow velocity was considered negligible since the velocity component along the main channel direction was dominant with respect to the transversal one the field experimental data was collected from 30 min runs and time averaged values of rotational speed water speed and output power were calculated the turbine power was evaluated in lundin et al 2016 performance results were presented for cases of inflow speed range from 1 2 m s to 1 4 m s and tip speed ratio values in the range between 3 0 and 4 0 the turbine was able to self start if the average water speed was greater than 1 m s otherwise the generator had to run as a motor the best data was obtained at higher flow speeds as too much energy was lost due to different losses in the system for low flow speeds in the present study experimental data on the performance of a vertical axis turbine system tested in the dalälven river were used as a benchmark to validate a two dimensional cfd approach by ansys fluent and to compare it to a three dimensional low order approach by a vortex model the cfd model can be used as a virtual test bench for optimizing the turbine efficiency by easily modifying the geometrical parameters such as the number of blades the airfoil shape the turbine solidity and the blade pitch angle in particular several attempts to assess the effects of blade pitch angles have been done in the past but mainly for wind applications as previously pointed out for marine current applications the majority of the studies are focused on the optimization of the performance of horizontal axis turbines ren et al 2017 wang et al 2019 zhu et al 2020 the goal of the work presented here is to identify the optimized pitch angle for a five blade vertical axis turbine by means of numerical simulation tools improvements in the performance predictions over low order modelling typically used in the design phase of the turbines will be shown with respect to the present technical literature the novelty of the current study can be summarized with the following highlights most of the existing works have pertained to the tidal turbine performance under laboratory conditions and very little experimental information is available for marine current turbine systems that were carried out in real operating conditions especially for vertical axis turbines as the results current achievements from measurements apply to validate numerical works in fact it should be noted that a correct prediction of the turbine efficiency and operations can have a strong industrial relevance being the most relevant component to account for in the structural design processes a wide range of pitch angles from β 5 to 5 with increments of 1 see fig 4 for the definition of the pitch angle is investigated and includes the optimized pitch angle this provides a more detailed insight into the effect of blade pitch on the performance of the turbine and the acting hydrodynamic forces on the rotor blades and shaft the minimization of fluctuating loadings is indeed crucial to maximize turbine longevity the current study presents a comparison of two dimensional simulations by ansys fluent and three dimensional ones by vortex model the provided information can evaluate the accuracy among different numerical approaches and significantly support on deciding which numerical approach should work better in similar conditions in this work the numerical analysis will focus on the primary source of instantaneous forces and turbine power as a function of the azimuthal angle fig 4 the normal fni and tangential force fti acting on a single blade are calculated by eq 1 1 f i f ni f ti h f xi f yi sinθ cosθ cosθ sinθ where i index of blade numbers h blade height the thrust and lateral force acting on the whole turbine are calculated as 2 f x h i 1 n f xi 3 f y h i 1 n f yi the total torque acting on the whole turbine is 4 t θ r 1 n f t i rh 1 n f xi cosθ f yi sinθ the average outputs of torque and power are calculated as 5 t av 1 2 π 0 2 π t θ dθ 6 p hydro 1 2 π 0 2 π ω t θ dθ finally the power coefficient of the turbine is calculated by eq 7 7 c p turbine power total power of flow p hydro p loss 1 2 ρ v 3 hd 2 cfd numerical model 2 1 test case and operational characteristics the selected vamt was designed with five blades to obtain a higher uniformity in instantaneous outputs i e forces torques compared to a lower number of blades such as a three bladed one table 2 describes the five straight bladed turbine with geometrical and operational characteristics the turbine has a 2 94 m radius 3 5 m height and the blade profile is a symmetric naca0021 airfoil with a 0 18 m uniform chord the two dimensional computational domain employed in the simulation is a rectangle of 325 m 529 m where the turbine centre is set at a distance of 30r from the inlet boundary and 60r from the outlet having a large width helps to reduce the effect of blockage in the lateral direction the 2d assumption can be considered suitable for the present case study since roughly 80 of the blade span was operating in a region of the flow profile with a 3 variation of incoming velocity 2 2 modelling approach to predict the fluid flow around the turbine numerical simulations have been carried out using the commercial cfd software package ansys fluent 19 0 with the finite volume method guide 2018 the authors have already assessed the main numerical settings during previous activities carried out both for the specific case of vertical axis water turbines bianchini et al 2017 as well as for vertical axis wind turbines balduzzi et al 2016 nguyen et al 2020 the incompressible unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans set of equations was solved using the coupled pressure velocity coupling scheme a second order scheme was adopted for the finite differencing of momentum energy and turbulence equations as well as the bounded second order implicit for the transient formulation turbulence was modelled using the k omega sst turbulence model the boundary conditions at the inlet and outlet are uniform velocity and gauge pressure respectively the inlet velocity was kept constant at 1 4 m s for all numerical simulations while the outlet was defined with pressure equal to 0 pa the top and bottom boundary were free slip walls that had shear stress equal to zero on the blade surfaces the flow moves with zero relative speed therefore the surfaces had no slip walls 2 3 mesh properties the computational domain is divided into two distinct zones a rotating zone and a stationary zone fig 5 a sliding interface connects the rotating zone having a radius of 1 5 times the turbine radius with the surrounding stationary area to create a finer mesh for particular regions of the computational domain different influence bodies were defined in the model geometry to generate designated size meshes such influence bodies have no physical effect during the simulations five circular influence bodies applied for every single blade and one enclosing the rotating area are employed in the numerical simulations the circular bodies are located with the origin at their airfoil centres 0 5c and have a radius equal to the chord length the influence body over the rotating zone is stretched towards the downstream region of the domain to better catch the velocity gradients in the turbine s wake the computational grid is created with quadrilateral cells for the boundary layer grid close to the walls fig 6 the first layer is defined to guarantee that the maximum y in the simulations is less than 5 in order to resolve the viscous sublayer three grid resolutions are tested where the grid is non uniform and refined refinement with a factor of 2 is employed leading to a fine grid with 1 1 106 cells a medium grid with 5 0 105 cells and a coarse grid with 2 5 105 cells table 3 the mesh independency with respect to the refinement levels was evaluated in terms of instantaneous torques of a blade against azimuth during the last turbine revolution as reported in fig 7 for the tsr of 3 1 the difference between medium and fine grids in terms of average power coefficient is 0 35 which satisfies the grid convergence requirement therefore all the cfd results shown in the present work employed the medium mesh 2 4 convergence criterion to evaluate the convergence of the simulations the revolution histories of the average power for different tsrs are shown in fig 8 data are reported as the relative change against the value achieved at the last revolution a smaller variation is observed when approaching the 20th revolution since the difference between the average power coefficient at the 19th revolution and the final revolution 20th revolution is roughly 0 1 based on this sensitivity analysis 20 revolutions were considered suitable for reaching a periodic condition and it was adopted for the rest of the simulations 2 5 azimuthal step size the instantaneous torque profiles with three different steps of δθ1 0 2 δθ2 0 15 δθ3 0 1 were examined to evaluate the impact of the azimuthal discretization on numerical predictions according to the results shown in fig 9 a significant part of the torque extraction is independent on the choice of the timestep in some parts of the graph θ 90 135 and θ 230 270 the instantaneous torques show slight differences which can be explained by two reasons the first one is related to the high value of the angle of attack aoa reached during the upstream half of the rotation θ 90 135 causing the flow around the blade to become unstable the second one is related to the interaction between the blade and the wake of the central shaft occurring around θ 270 and leading to an earlier downstream stall as also confirmed in section 6 3 therefore in these two aforementioned conditions the hydrodynamics of the airfoil is more complex than the rest of the rotating cycle due to the complexity of the hydrodynamics involved the difference in the instantaneous torques predicted using δθ1 0 2 and δθ3 0 1 is big in order to capture the flow characteristics with high accuracy the azimuthal step δθ 0 1 is selected for all of the following simulations 3 validation of cfd model to ensure the accuracy of the cfd results obtained in the present work validation studies were performed since the output of a cfd simulation only accounts for the hydrodynamic forces the power losses due to iron losses and mechanical losses in the generator are not computed therefore cfd results must be corrected to be consistent with power measurements the experimental resistant torque was estimated in forslund et al 2018 by means of the following equation t res 350 1000 ω 2 such empirical correlation which was accounting also for the hydrodynamic drag due to the turbine struts was applied to the hydrodynamic cfd torque output to compute the predicted efficiency the numerical results of the two dimensional 2d simulations carried out with fluent for tsrs from 2 0 to 4 0 are compared with experimental measurements in fig 10 in addition the 2d cfd results are compared also to the predictions of a low order numerical model based on a three dimensional 3d vortex method simulation which is described in mendoza and goude 2020 and only a brief description is provided here the vortex method in general is a modelling technique where the vorticity is used as a discretization variable instead of the velocity the presented method is a free vortex method where the flow velocity is reconstructed from the vorticity using biot savart s law with this approach the simulation domain will be infinite while only the regions with vorticity i e the turbine wake will be discretized the current work uses a 3d vortex filament method where the vortices are discretized by a vortex lattice here one creates a grid of nodes and adds vortex filaments between neighbour nodes i e each node connects to 4 filaments in the general case for each time step the grid points are moved with the same speed as the flow velocity the vortex method is based on the use of an external force model to obtain lift and drag forces the vortex method splits the blades into segments and uses a flat panel method with the kutta condition to calculate the circulation around each segment which then can be converted into the corresponding angle of attack for the attached flow case this is the angle of attack that will be used to calculate blade forces according to the method described in dyachuk and goude 2015 which is a combination of a table of lift and drag coefficients with a leishman beddoes dynamic stall model the vortex method then calculates the new circulation according to kutta joukowski s lift formula to get the bound circulation the released circulation is then obtained as the change in bound circulation combined by the condition that the vorticity field needs to be divergence free for the vortex propagation step it is assumed that the blade can be approximated by a single lifting line this approximation is verified in dyachuk et al 2015 the inclusion of the potential flow solution for the angle of attack calculation allows the model to account for both the flow curvature effects and the tip effects without any additional correction models the turbine was discretized into 26 blade segments for each blade and 15 segments for each strut at the connection point it was ensured that the tip of the strut connected to the edge between two blade segments all simulations were performed for 25 revolutions to ensure convergence for all cases actual convergence occurred much earlier and each revolution consisted of 90 time steps all these parameters have been tested earlier to ensure that they are sufficient for converged results there is a suitable agreement between the numerical predictions and the experimental data in which the 2d cfd results exhibit the much better agreement with experimental values than the 3d vortex model outcomes it is apparent that the trend of cp as a function of the tsr is captured reasonably well particularly at moderate tsrs tsr 3 0 3 5 the difference between 2d results and measurements is small and at high tsrs tsr 3 5 4 0 the cfd slightly underpredicts the measured turbine power output second the turbine reaches its maximum power coefficient at a design tsr of 3 0 according to fluent estimations while the vortex method predicts the maximum efficiency for tsr 2 8 to quantify the relative error between measurements and numerical results the difference between the experimental torque and the 2d cfd simulations that occurs at tsr 3 1 and at tsr 3 5 is 1 7 and 8 7 respectively such discrepancies can be related to different aspects such as the instantaneous variability of the water speed the actual turbulence conditions of the real flow or the geometrical simplification in the 2d model based on the aforementioned considerations the numerical approach was properly replicating both the trend and maximum values of cp thus being able to provide a satisfactory insight of experimental data therefore cfd simulations were assumed to be predictive of the phenomenology related to a pitch angle variation the focus of the study presented in the following sections is on the analysis of the turbine power and loadings under the influence of the blade pitch angles as the cfd model is two dimensional and the vortex method cannot handle velocity shear both cases will assume that the incoming velocity is uniform while this is true in the horizontal direction was confirmed through measurements with a horizontally mounted adcp in front of the turbine there will be a slight error as to the vertical shear shown in fig 3 is not taken into account this limitation is present due to limitations in computational resources 4 impact of blade pitch angle on power coefficient to evaluate the pitch effect on the vamt performance the variation of the power coefficient for pitch angle values ranging from 5 to 5 at a tsr 3 1 is depicted in fig 11 this tsr was selected because it corresponds to the maximum power coefficient for the tidal turbine at the zero referenced pitch according to the experimental data in the detailed analysis of cp as a function of β obtained in fig 11 two numerical approaches were investigated the solid line corresponds to the 2d fluent simulations the dashed line is from 3d vortex simulations fig 11 reports that the average cp increases as the pitch angle is progressively increased from 5 reaching the maximum value for β 2 in case of cfd predictions while for β 1 in case of vortex model predictions by further increasing the pitch angle the cp gradually decreases in general at positive pitch angles the turbine has a higher efficiency than at the negative angles moreover the decreasing trend is steeper for negative pitch angles than for positive angles indeed the blade loading is increased for negative β values thus increasing the risk of reaching stalled conditions this can be seen in fig 12 where the instantaneous torque trends as a function of the azimuthal position are shown for all the cfd cases the more negative β the more the upstream torque peak is anticipated as a result the onset of the dynamic stall phenomenon can be observed as the blade experiences large torque fluctuations between θ 50 180 resulting in a greater power loss of the turbine the azimuthal position for which the blade generates the maximum torque is θ 78 74 68 63 and 59 for β 1 2 3 4 and 5 respectively while for almost all positive pitch angles it occurs constantly around θ 90 the effect of the central shaft can be seen when the torque suffers from a sudden drop between θ 255 and θ 290 the amplitude of the drop is deeper for lower pitch angles being the greater power loss obtained for β 5 it can be concluded that when adopting negative pitch angles a higher torque extraction is obtained only in a small part of the upstream region 15 θ 75 while the positive β can enhance the torque output over a large portion of the revolution i e 75 θ 140 and 270 θ 360 for the present test case the designed pitch angle of 2 is established as the optimal angle to be adopted for the vertical axis turbine in the tidal application which ensures a balanced and high torque extraction during both the upstream and the downstream halves of the rotation 5 optimized pitch analysis 5 1 power coefficient once the optimized pitch has been defined the turbine power as a function of the tip speed ratio was also evaluated for the β 2 case from a perusal of fig 13 it can easily be seen that the large variation of the angle of attack occurring at a low tip speed ratio leads to the onset of the dynamic stall the turbine hydrodynamics is unstable and some ﬂuctuations appear in the simulation results tsr 2 0 and 2 5 the explanation of the magniﬁed ripples in the cfd prediction can be related to two reasons on one hand cfd is thought to have low accuracy in capturing the evolution of deep stall separation and vortex shedding with a two dimensional approach which usually leads to vortical structures being more coherent and less prone to breakdown on the other hand due to vertical velocity shear and turbulence one can also expect that the oscillations predicted by cfd can likely disappear due to an intrinsic averaging along the height of the blade as the oscillations will not be synchronized at different blade heights at high tip speed ratios the torques stretch down deeply in drop areas θ 273 300 particularly at tsr 4 0 the torque has significant change at the drop peak overall however the high average of the torques was noticed at moderate tip speed ratios and the optimum tip speed ratio is a tsr 3 0 fig 14 shows the power coefficient of the turbine with blade pitch β 5 2 0 2 5 and the optimal pitch turbine has the maximum efficiency of 27 that is 2 3 higher than the turbine having blade pitch β 0 upon examinations of the results some observations can be made for fig 14 the variation of the cp max is very coherent for all pitch angle the cp max is more sensitive to the negative pitches than to the positive ones for too negative pitch values the power output is strongly reduced at all tsrs in these conditions the efficiency drops down to almost zero due to the massive presence of stall conditions the optimal tsr is slightly different among the various blade pitches tsropt 2 9 at β 5 2 tsropt 3 0 at β 0 1 2 tsropt 3 1 at β 5 the characteristics of power generation according to tsr are important factors in constructing an optimal turbine system for connecting with a proper electric generator the power output increases as the rotating speed becomes faster however it decreases after the peak point because at high tsr the variation of the angle of attack is reduced and the effect of drag becomes more prominent it can be the crucial input for electricity controlling systems and helpful for designers 5 2 blade and turbine loadings to assess the sensitivity of the results in terms of fluctuating forces acting on a single blade and on the whole turbine the average and instantaneous forces are analyzed in figs 15 and 16 the trend of tangential force ft on the blade in fig 14a is consistent with the trend of power against pitch angles of fig 11 reaching the optimized value at β 2 the optimal average ft is 2 8 higher than the tangential force at β 0 similarly to the trend of the power coefficient in the radial direction the instantaneous normal force fn which is representative of the main structural loads on the blades is shown in fig 14b in case of negative pitch fluctuations of fn appear in the upstream region θ 65 160 while it only happens at β 5 in the downstream region for positive pitch the central shaft has an impact on the normal force at all pitch angles and it is marked by the drop happening analogously to the torque trend at around θ 270 it is apparent that the optimal pitch angle allows for reducing the maximum normal load on the blade with respect to the baseline zero pitch since the maximum negative fn peak is delayed by roughly 6 with the amplitude being 11 lower it can be generally stated that the upstream peak of fn as well as the total amplitude of oscillation is progressively reduced as the blade pitch is increased thus resulting in a reduced and more balanced fatigue loading fig 16 presents the sum of the instantaneous force trends acting on all the blades along the x and y directions being representative of the global loadings acting on the whole turbine for fx it is always positive for all different pitch angles since the turbine is pushed backwards fx is the main force on the shaft and on the foundation and it is pivotal for dimensioning the entire machine because it has to resist to the thrust in order not to bend from a perusal of fig 16a it can be noticed that the optimal pitch allows reducing the maximum value of the instantaneous fx by roughly 3 which implies a reduction of the maximum stress acting on the foundation fy force is responsible for the lateral oscillation of the shaft but since the contribution of each individual blade constantly changes in sign during the rotation the effect of different blades can compensate each other increasing the number of blades could help in reducing fy oscillation and in the present case with the five blades the total instantaneous fy is almost constant fig 16c and negligible with respect to the x component especially for the reference and optimized values of β finally table 3 reports the averaged values for the global torque and force components in order to quantify the benefits already pointed out from a qualitative point of view in figs 14 16 in particular it is worth pointing out that the average thrust for the optimal pitch case is 1 9 lower than the reference zero pitch case 5 3 flow field visualization to further clarify the effect of pitch angle on the hydrodynamics of the vamt some useful insights regarding the flow field around the turbine are visualized in this section the vorticity field at tsr 3 0 has been analyzed for three different pitch angles β 2 0 2 fig 17 fluctuations in case of β 2 are less retained than those of pitch angles of 0 and 2 the leeward part is clearly affected by the wakes shed during the upstream part in the streamward zone the blades move towards the water at higher relative velocities and generate much narrower wakes on the other hand on the leeward side of the rotor vortices are shed from the blades and roll up before being convected this results in more intricate flow patterns where the new vortices shed from the incoming blades are convected across traces of vortices shed by the previous blades the flow becomes blurry nevertheless it is still possible to associate each wake to its corresponding blade this can be an explanation for the oscillatory behaviour of the torques and forces at the negative pitches on the blade in figs 12 and 15 these results add more evidence to the confirmation about the optimal operation of the turbine and identify the pitch angles leading to poor turbine performance which need to be avoided 6 conclusions in this paper the influence of the blade pitch angle on the power output structural loadings and hydrodynamics of an h darrieus vertical axis turbine for marine current applications was investigated through numerical calculations using a 2d urans approach the power coefficient trend resulting from the 2d cfd simulations was compared to the outcomes of a lower fidelity 3d vortex model showing a better agreement with experimental data collected in the open field site for the reference turbine the reliability of the optimization analysis through cfd simulations was assessed and validated by the field test considering the reference case of a zero pitch angle therefore a wide range of blade pitch angles was tested on the vamt and the results were analyzed in terms of instantaneous forces fn ft fx fy during its revolution and average loadings on the single blade and the whole turbine a sudden drop area in the downstream region was observed in both the radial and tangent direction of the forces caused by the presence of the wake of the turbine shaft these effects were critical factors during the design process for such the blade pitch and rotor shaft particularly in case of highly pitched blades or large shaft radius in comparison to the turbine radius i e the radius ratio of 5 in this study the main finding of the study was the assessment of the optimal pitch β 2 ensuring a 2 3 higher cp and a 1 9 lower average thrust if compared to the zero referenced pitch also in terms of instantaneous fluctuating loadings the optimal pitch allowed reducing both the maximum peak of the normal force acting on a single blade by 11 and the maximum peak thrust force by 3 this finding can represent a practical solution being at the same time simple and inexpensive in considering an optimal fixed pitch for maximizing the performance while at the same time reducing the hydrodynamic loads on the structure moreover transient cfd analysis showed that the pitch angle has an impact on the strength of the shed vorticity by vamt blades suggesting that a moderate positive pitch i e β 0 2 guarantees a smoother and more stable operation credit authorship contribution statement minh thao nguyen conceptualization

20208,the use of vertical axis turbines in marine current applications for electric energy generation is still in early developments and one of the key factors for assessing the applicability of such technology is the power coefficient to contribute towards the highly competitive market of renewable energy conversions the turbine system requires good outcomes in terms of energy yield in this scenario one of the main challenges regarding the design process to improve the blade performance is to find the best trade off between the maximization of the power output and the minimization of the structural loadings in the current work the influence of blade pitch angles on the hydrodynamics of a vertical axis five blade water turbine has been studied the pitch angles from 5 to 5 were investigated using computational fluid dynamics cfd the simulations were validated against experimental data for the power coefficient collected in a river overall a good agreement was found in terms of computed power between simulations and experiments for a wide range of tip speed ratios the cfd model was proven to be suitable for exploratory analyses and an optimized design was found providing a 2 3 higher power coefficient by adopting a pitch angle of 2 compared to the zero referenced pitch angle besides validating with the experiment the cfd simulations were compared with the results of a vortex model the effect of different pitch angles on the performance prediction and on the blade and turbine loadings was also discussed it is becoming vital to develop an understanding of the complex interaction of vertical axis turbines especially in tidal current areas where there is a lack of detailed experimental data keywords vertical axis marine current turbine pitch angle optimization power coefficient normal force tangential force hydrodynamics cfd 1 introduction 1 1 background the global community and more locally europe aim to be climate neutral by 2050 council 2050 to this end marine current energy extraction has gained a greater interest as a possible alternative energy resource various types of marine current energy converters have been developed to extract electrical energy from the tidal energy resource in general three technologies are utilized to convert tidal currents into mechanical energy to produce electricity horizontal axis turbines vertical axis turbines and oscillating hydrofoils energy 2019 maldar et al 2020 yuce and muratoglu 2015 among these technologies the horizontal axis marine current turbines hamts are more developed and can be utilized to obtain a large quantity of energy from marine currents this technology accounts for 76 of r d efforts in the development of tidal devices worldwide government 2015 by contrast the vertical axis turbines in marine current applications are in primary developments fig 1 shows the number of publications involving vertical axis tidal turbines and compares it to the corresponding wind projects the results were achieved by searching elsevier s abstract database in scopus and show that the published papers currently on the vertical axis marine current turbines vamts are approximately 7 compared to the vertical axis wind turbines vawts although vertical axis tidal machines and wind machines have a similar working principle in generating electricity a specific challenge in setting up experimental facilities to assess the turbine performance when using man made environments i e tanks tunnels is related to the interaction between flow and boundaries in constrained conditions the boundaries can alter the characteristics of the flow field therefore the result of experimental water tanks data may lead to errors that cannot be neglected a few studies have indicated that tank tests lead to solid blockage effects as well as scale problem due to a spatially restricted domain garrett and cummins 2007 whelan and grahamjp 2020 bahaj et al 2007 kolekar and banerjee 2015 to address these limitations experimental performance should be characterized at real sites without blockage effects for one type of vertical axis turbines a real scale field test was conducted by sandia national laboratories in 1981 that investigated the effects of blade pitch for wind turbines klimas and worstell 1981 for tidal applications an open site test was carried out by nihon university in 1996 and it still represents a useful benchmark for validating numerical works kiho et al 1996 therefore there is a lack of validation data to support numerical simulations of straight bladed darrieus tidal turbines the challenges in the marine current application mentioned above have become one of the motivations for the marine current research group at uppsala university to create a project to perform experiments in a river yuen et al 2007 lundin et al 2015 grabbe et al 2013a in 2013 a prototype of the vertical axis water turbine was deployed in the open research site of the river dalälven the flow range of the river was suitable for research purposes and allowed to characterize the turbine for a wide range of tip speed ratios the full scale test has been performed for the turbine with the zero reference pitch in 2016 lundin et al 2016 the possibility of enhancing the turbine performance will be investigated in the current study with the main focus of finding the optimal balance between power output and blade loadings due to hydrodynamic forces acting on the rotor 1 2 previous studies on pitch optimization vertical axis turbines have been facing major challenges in establishing themselves in the renewable energy scenario if compared to horizontal axis turbines the main reason is related to the relatively lower efficiency due to the intrinsic functioning principle as they can reach power coefficients up to 30 50 moreover the turbine is not always capable of self starting and often relies on a starting mechanism according to the current standard regarding the performance optimization of darrieus rotors the main geometrical design parameters typically involved are the airfoil de tavernier et al 2019 the blade pitch angle bianchini et al 2015 the number of blades solidity rezaeiha et al 2018 the turbine aspect ratio as well as the use of external components such as deflectors and ducts alidadi 2004 among these options the pitch angle optimization seems the simplest in terms of constructions within the present study a detailed review on blade pitch optimization for vertical axis turbines was carried out by the authors upon examination of the several works 22 publications identified in the technical literature some general considerations can be outlined as follows pitch optimization is usually carried out by focusing the analysis on the maximization of the turbine efficiency while the modification in terms of aerodynamic hydrodynamic loadings is mostly neglected this can be tolerable for vawt since when dealing with a low density fluid at high rotational speeds the centrifugal force is dominant for the structural resistance of the machine conversely when dealing with water the situation becomes more critical since the hydrodynamic loads become more relevant and particular attention must be paid to the analysis of the forces acting on both the blades and the central shaft an active control of the pitch angle throughout the revolution is theoretically the most effective solution paraschivoiu et al 2009 kirke and lazauskas 2011 however it implies a significant increase of the turbine complexity particularly the authors believe that fixed pitch for underwater applications is most realistic since a pitching mechanism is complicated combined with problems such as biofouling and subject to much larger stresses than in case of air operation and maintenance of the pitch mechanism would also be more complicated for an underwater application the optimal fixed pitch angle will depend on multiple design parameters such as blade profile reynolds number turbine solidity number of blades etc still making it an open question and the outcome may be different for different turbines the difficulty of performing underwater tests has led to a lack of experimental data as well as optimization of water turbines which limit further development and application of such devices a more extensive overview of the selected studies is given in table 1 where the works are classified in terms of main geometrical features of the turbine optimal pitch and type of application upon examination of table 1 it is apparent that most of the works have been carried out for turbines having 2 or 3 blades and operating at low reynolds below 106 since the working fluid is usually air and the radius of the rotor is usually less than 1 m the validation studies for vertical axis turbines especially in marine current application are mostly from man made environments such as tanks the common range of investigated pitch angles is up to 8 values and the optimum is case dependent it can be finally concluded that there is room for further investigation on the impact of the blade pitch for different geometrical and operating conditions as well as to further increase the knowledge concerning the fluctuating loadings which are essential to assess the life expectancy of the turbine 1 3 validation data and motivation for the current study the present activity aims at analyzing the case of a five blade marine turbine operating at high reynolds above 106 thus representing a not commonly studied solution according to the formerly published works a full scale reference rotor was investigated in a river by the marine current research group of uppsala university all the details can be found in refs yuen et al 2007 lundin et al 2015 grabbe et al 2013b in which an extensive collection of experimental data is also provided the main features of the project however are summarized as follows a prototype of the vertical axis water turbine with a rated power of 7 5 kw was deployed in 2013 at the open research site of the river dalälven which has a 7 m depth and is located at a distance of 70 km north of uppsala university fig 2 the five blade turbine was placed 800 m downstream of a conventional hydropower plant that could keep the water velocity constant during the test the turbine was equipped with a 112 pole direct drive permanent magnet synchronous generator that has an 87 efficiency at nominal condition grabbe et al 2013a the generator was mounted on a tripod foundation of the turbine in water while the control system consisted of starting circuits and resistive loads was placed in an inland cabin the river water velocity was suitable for research purposes which allowed to investigate the turbine operation for a wide range of tip speed ratios the water speed was measured at 2 3 turbine diameters upstream and downstream of the turbine by acoustic doppler current profiles adcp the collected values during one year which mostly varied between 0 7 and 1 5 m s are shown in fig 3 a the velocity profile in the vertical direction against the river depth is presented in fig 3b it should be noted that the adcp only is reliable up to 1 m from the surface hence the shape seen close to the surface can be attributed to measurement errors the largest portion of the blade span operates at nominal speed while only in proximity of blade tips the velocity reduction is larger than 10 such reduction is supposed not to have a big impact on the performance due to the intrinsic tip loss experienced lateral variation of flow velocity was considered negligible since the velocity component along the main channel direction was dominant with respect to the transversal one the field experimental data was collected from 30 min runs and time averaged values of rotational speed water speed and output power were calculated the turbine power was evaluated in lundin et al 2016 performance results were presented for cases of inflow speed range from 1 2 m s to 1 4 m s and tip speed ratio values in the range between 3 0 and 4 0 the turbine was able to self start if the average water speed was greater than 1 m s otherwise the generator had to run as a motor the best data was obtained at higher flow speeds as too much energy was lost due to different losses in the system for low flow speeds in the present study experimental data on the performance of a vertical axis turbine system tested in the dalälven river were used as a benchmark to validate a two dimensional cfd approach by ansys fluent and to compare it to a three dimensional low order approach by a vortex model the cfd model can be used as a virtual test bench for optimizing the turbine efficiency by easily modifying the geometrical parameters such as the number of blades the airfoil shape the turbine solidity and the blade pitch angle in particular several attempts to assess the effects of blade pitch angles have been done in the past but mainly for wind applications as previously pointed out for marine current applications the majority of the studies are focused on the optimization of the performance of horizontal axis turbines ren et al 2017 wang et al 2019 zhu et al 2020 the goal of the work presented here is to identify the optimized pitch angle for a five blade vertical axis turbine by means of numerical simulation tools improvements in the performance predictions over low order modelling typically used in the design phase of the turbines will be shown with respect to the present technical literature the novelty of the current study can be summarized with the following highlights most of the existing works have pertained to the tidal turbine performance under laboratory conditions and very little experimental information is available for marine current turbine systems that were carried out in real operating conditions especially for vertical axis turbines as the results current achievements from measurements apply to validate numerical works in fact it should be noted that a correct prediction of the turbine efficiency and operations can have a strong industrial relevance being the most relevant component to account for in the structural design processes a wide range of pitch angles from β 5 to 5 with increments of 1 see fig 4 for the definition of the pitch angle is investigated and includes the optimized pitch angle this provides a more detailed insight into the effect of blade pitch on the performance of the turbine and the acting hydrodynamic forces on the rotor blades and shaft the minimization of fluctuating loadings is indeed crucial to maximize turbine longevity the current study presents a comparison of two dimensional simulations by ansys fluent and three dimensional ones by vortex model the provided information can evaluate the accuracy among different numerical approaches and significantly support on deciding which numerical approach should work better in similar conditions in this work the numerical analysis will focus on the primary source of instantaneous forces and turbine power as a function of the azimuthal angle fig 4 the normal fni and tangential force fti acting on a single blade are calculated by eq 1 1 f i f ni f ti h f xi f yi sinθ cosθ cosθ sinθ where i index of blade numbers h blade height the thrust and lateral force acting on the whole turbine are calculated as 2 f x h i 1 n f xi 3 f y h i 1 n f yi the total torque acting on the whole turbine is 4 t θ r 1 n f t i rh 1 n f xi cosθ f yi sinθ the average outputs of torque and power are calculated as 5 t av 1 2 π 0 2 π t θ dθ 6 p hydro 1 2 π 0 2 π ω t θ dθ finally the power coefficient of the turbine is calculated by eq 7 7 c p turbine power total power of flow p hydro p loss 1 2 ρ v 3 hd 2 cfd numerical model 2 1 test case and operational characteristics the selected vamt was designed with five blades to obtain a higher uniformity in instantaneous outputs i e forces torques compared to a lower number of blades such as a three bladed one table 2 describes the five straight bladed turbine with geometrical and operational characteristics the turbine has a 2 94 m radius 3 5 m height and the blade profile is a symmetric naca0021 airfoil with a 0 18 m uniform chord the two dimensional computational domain employed in the simulation is a rectangle of 325 m 529 m where the turbine centre is set at a distance of 30r from the inlet boundary and 60r from the outlet having a large width helps to reduce the effect of blockage in the lateral direction the 2d assumption can be considered suitable for the present case study since roughly 80 of the blade span was operating in a region of the flow profile with a 3 variation of incoming velocity 2 2 modelling approach to predict the fluid flow around the turbine numerical simulations have been carried out using the commercial cfd software package ansys fluent 19 0 with the finite volume method guide 2018 the authors have already assessed the main numerical settings during previous activities carried out both for the specific case of vertical axis water turbines bianchini et al 2017 as well as for vertical axis wind turbines balduzzi et al 2016 nguyen et al 2020 the incompressible unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans set of equations was solved using the coupled pressure velocity coupling scheme a second order scheme was adopted for the finite differencing of momentum energy and turbulence equations as well as the bounded second order implicit for the transient formulation turbulence was modelled using the k omega sst turbulence model the boundary conditions at the inlet and outlet are uniform velocity and gauge pressure respectively the inlet velocity was kept constant at 1 4 m s for all numerical simulations while the outlet was defined with pressure equal to 0 pa the top and bottom boundary were free slip walls that had shear stress equal to zero on the blade surfaces the flow moves with zero relative speed therefore the surfaces had no slip walls 2 3 mesh properties the computational domain is divided into two distinct zones a rotating zone and a stationary zone fig 5 a sliding interface connects the rotating zone having a radius of 1 5 times the turbine radius with the surrounding stationary area to create a finer mesh for particular regions of the computational domain different influence bodies were defined in the model geometry to generate designated size meshes such influence bodies have no physical effect during the simulations five circular influence bodies applied for every single blade and one enclosing the rotating area are employed in the numerical simulations the circular bodies are located with the origin at their airfoil centres 0 5c and have a radius equal to the chord length the influence body over the rotating zone is stretched towards the downstream region of the domain to better catch the velocity gradients in the turbine s wake the computational grid is created with quadrilateral cells for the boundary layer grid close to the walls fig 6 the first layer is defined to guarantee that the maximum y in the simulations is less than 5 in order to resolve the viscous sublayer three grid resolutions are tested where the grid is non uniform and refined refinement with a factor of 2 is employed leading to a fine grid with 1 1 106 cells a medium grid with 5 0 105 cells and a coarse grid with 2 5 105 cells table 3 the mesh independency with respect to the refinement levels was evaluated in terms of instantaneous torques of a blade against azimuth during the last turbine revolution as reported in fig 7 for the tsr of 3 1 the difference between medium and fine grids in terms of average power coefficient is 0 35 which satisfies the grid convergence requirement therefore all the cfd results shown in the present work employed the medium mesh 2 4 convergence criterion to evaluate the convergence of the simulations the revolution histories of the average power for different tsrs are shown in fig 8 data are reported as the relative change against the value achieved at the last revolution a smaller variation is observed when approaching the 20th revolution since the difference between the average power coefficient at the 19th revolution and the final revolution 20th revolution is roughly 0 1 based on this sensitivity analysis 20 revolutions were considered suitable for reaching a periodic condition and it was adopted for the rest of the simulations 2 5 azimuthal step size the instantaneous torque profiles with three different steps of δθ1 0 2 δθ2 0 15 δθ3 0 1 were examined to evaluate the impact of the azimuthal discretization on numerical predictions according to the results shown in fig 9 a significant part of the torque extraction is independent on the choice of the timestep in some parts of the graph θ 90 135 and θ 230 270 the instantaneous torques show slight differences which can be explained by two reasons the first one is related to the high value of the angle of attack aoa reached during the upstream half of the rotation θ 90 135 causing the flow around the blade to become unstable the second one is related to the interaction between the blade and the wake of the central shaft occurring around θ 270 and leading to an earlier downstream stall as also confirmed in section 6 3 therefore in these two aforementioned conditions the hydrodynamics of the airfoil is more complex than the rest of the rotating cycle due to the complexity of the hydrodynamics involved the difference in the instantaneous torques predicted using δθ1 0 2 and δθ3 0 1 is big in order to capture the flow characteristics with high accuracy the azimuthal step δθ 0 1 is selected for all of the following simulations 3 validation of cfd model to ensure the accuracy of the cfd results obtained in the present work validation studies were performed since the output of a cfd simulation only accounts for the hydrodynamic forces the power losses due to iron losses and mechanical losses in the generator are not computed therefore cfd results must be corrected to be consistent with power measurements the experimental resistant torque was estimated in forslund et al 2018 by means of the following equation t res 350 1000 ω 2 such empirical correlation which was accounting also for the hydrodynamic drag due to the turbine struts was applied to the hydrodynamic cfd torque output to compute the predicted efficiency the numerical results of the two dimensional 2d simulations carried out with fluent for tsrs from 2 0 to 4 0 are compared with experimental measurements in fig 10 in addition the 2d cfd results are compared also to the predictions of a low order numerical model based on a three dimensional 3d vortex method simulation which is described in mendoza and goude 2020 and only a brief description is provided here the vortex method in general is a modelling technique where the vorticity is used as a discretization variable instead of the velocity the presented method is a free vortex method where the flow velocity is reconstructed from the vorticity using biot savart s law with this approach the simulation domain will be infinite while only the regions with vorticity i e the turbine wake will be discretized the current work uses a 3d vortex filament method where the vortices are discretized by a vortex lattice here one creates a grid of nodes and adds vortex filaments between neighbour nodes i e each node connects to 4 filaments in the general case for each time step the grid points are moved with the same speed as the flow velocity the vortex method is based on the use of an external force model to obtain lift and drag forces the vortex method splits the blades into segments and uses a flat panel method with the kutta condition to calculate the circulation around each segment which then can be converted into the corresponding angle of attack for the attached flow case this is the angle of attack that will be used to calculate blade forces according to the method described in dyachuk and goude 2015 which is a combination of a table of lift and drag coefficients with a leishman beddoes dynamic stall model the vortex method then calculates the new circulation according to kutta joukowski s lift formula to get the bound circulation the released circulation is then obtained as the change in bound circulation combined by the condition that the vorticity field needs to be divergence free for the vortex propagation step it is assumed that the blade can be approximated by a single lifting line this approximation is verified in dyachuk et al 2015 the inclusion of the potential flow solution for the angle of attack calculation allows the model to account for both the flow curvature effects and the tip effects without any additional correction models the turbine was discretized into 26 blade segments for each blade and 15 segments for each strut at the connection point it was ensured that the tip of the strut connected to the edge between two blade segments all simulations were performed for 25 revolutions to ensure convergence for all cases actual convergence occurred much earlier and each revolution consisted of 90 time steps all these parameters have been tested earlier to ensure that they are sufficient for converged results there is a suitable agreement between the numerical predictions and the experimental data in which the 2d cfd results exhibit the much better agreement with experimental values than the 3d vortex model outcomes it is apparent that the trend of cp as a function of the tsr is captured reasonably well particularly at moderate tsrs tsr 3 0 3 5 the difference between 2d results and measurements is small and at high tsrs tsr 3 5 4 0 the cfd slightly underpredicts the measured turbine power output second the turbine reaches its maximum power coefficient at a design tsr of 3 0 according to fluent estimations while the vortex method predicts the maximum efficiency for tsr 2 8 to quantify the relative error between measurements and numerical results the difference between the experimental torque and the 2d cfd simulations that occurs at tsr 3 1 and at tsr 3 5 is 1 7 and 8 7 respectively such discrepancies can be related to different aspects such as the instantaneous variability of the water speed the actual turbulence conditions of the real flow or the geometrical simplification in the 2d model based on the aforementioned considerations the numerical approach was properly replicating both the trend and maximum values of cp thus being able to provide a satisfactory insight of experimental data therefore cfd simulations were assumed to be predictive of the phenomenology related to a pitch angle variation the focus of the study presented in the following sections is on the analysis of the turbine power and loadings under the influence of the blade pitch angles as the cfd model is two dimensional and the vortex method cannot handle velocity shear both cases will assume that the incoming velocity is uniform while this is true in the horizontal direction was confirmed through measurements with a horizontally mounted adcp in front of the turbine there will be a slight error as to the vertical shear shown in fig 3 is not taken into account this limitation is present due to limitations in computational resources 4 impact of blade pitch angle on power coefficient to evaluate the pitch effect on the vamt performance the variation of the power coefficient for pitch angle values ranging from 5 to 5 at a tsr 3 1 is depicted in fig 11 this tsr was selected because it corresponds to the maximum power coefficient for the tidal turbine at the zero referenced pitch according to the experimental data in the detailed analysis of cp as a function of β obtained in fig 11 two numerical approaches were investigated the solid line corresponds to the 2d fluent simulations the dashed line is from 3d vortex simulations fig 11 reports that the average cp increases as the pitch angle is progressively increased from 5 reaching the maximum value for β 2 in case of cfd predictions while for β 1 in case of vortex model predictions by further increasing the pitch angle the cp gradually decreases in general at positive pitch angles the turbine has a higher efficiency than at the negative angles moreover the decreasing trend is steeper for negative pitch angles than for positive angles indeed the blade loading is increased for negative β values thus increasing the risk of reaching stalled conditions this can be seen in fig 12 where the instantaneous torque trends as a function of the azimuthal position are shown for all the cfd cases the more negative β the more the upstream torque peak is anticipated as a result the onset of the dynamic stall phenomenon can be observed as the blade experiences large torque fluctuations between θ 50 180 resulting in a greater power loss of the turbine the azimuthal position for which the blade generates the maximum torque is θ 78 74 68 63 and 59 for β 1 2 3 4 and 5 respectively while for almost all positive pitch angles it occurs constantly around θ 90 the effect of the central shaft can be seen when the torque suffers from a sudden drop between θ 255 and θ 290 the amplitude of the drop is deeper for lower pitch angles being the greater power loss obtained for β 5 it can be concluded that when adopting negative pitch angles a higher torque extraction is obtained only in a small part of the upstream region 15 θ 75 while the positive β can enhance the torque output over a large portion of the revolution i e 75 θ 140 and 270 θ 360 for the present test case the designed pitch angle of 2 is established as the optimal angle to be adopted for the vertical axis turbine in the tidal application which ensures a balanced and high torque extraction during both the upstream and the downstream halves of the rotation 5 optimized pitch analysis 5 1 power coefficient once the optimized pitch has been defined the turbine power as a function of the tip speed ratio was also evaluated for the β 2 case from a perusal of fig 13 it can easily be seen that the large variation of the angle of attack occurring at a low tip speed ratio leads to the onset of the dynamic stall the turbine hydrodynamics is unstable and some ﬂuctuations appear in the simulation results tsr 2 0 and 2 5 the explanation of the magniﬁed ripples in the cfd prediction can be related to two reasons on one hand cfd is thought to have low accuracy in capturing the evolution of deep stall separation and vortex shedding with a two dimensional approach which usually leads to vortical structures being more coherent and less prone to breakdown on the other hand due to vertical velocity shear and turbulence one can also expect that the oscillations predicted by cfd can likely disappear due to an intrinsic averaging along the height of the blade as the oscillations will not be synchronized at different blade heights at high tip speed ratios the torques stretch down deeply in drop areas θ 273 300 particularly at tsr 4 0 the torque has significant change at the drop peak overall however the high average of the torques was noticed at moderate tip speed ratios and the optimum tip speed ratio is a tsr 3 0 fig 14 shows the power coefficient of the turbine with blade pitch β 5 2 0 2 5 and the optimal pitch turbine has the maximum efficiency of 27 that is 2 3 higher than the turbine having blade pitch β 0 upon examinations of the results some observations can be made for fig 14 the variation of the cp max is very coherent for all pitch angle the cp max is more sensitive to the negative pitches than to the positive ones for too negative pitch values the power output is strongly reduced at all tsrs in these conditions the efficiency drops down to almost zero due to the massive presence of stall conditions the optimal tsr is slightly different among the various blade pitches tsropt 2 9 at β 5 2 tsropt 3 0 at β 0 1 2 tsropt 3 1 at β 5 the characteristics of power generation according to tsr are important factors in constructing an optimal turbine system for connecting with a proper electric generator the power output increases as the rotating speed becomes faster however it decreases after the peak point because at high tsr the variation of the angle of attack is reduced and the effect of drag becomes more prominent it can be the crucial input for electricity controlling systems and helpful for designers 5 2 blade and turbine loadings to assess the sensitivity of the results in terms of fluctuating forces acting on a single blade and on the whole turbine the average and instantaneous forces are analyzed in figs 15 and 16 the trend of tangential force ft on the blade in fig 14a is consistent with the trend of power against pitch angles of fig 11 reaching the optimized value at β 2 the optimal average ft is 2 8 higher than the tangential force at β 0 similarly to the trend of the power coefficient in the radial direction the instantaneous normal force fn which is representative of the main structural loads on the blades is shown in fig 14b in case of negative pitch fluctuations of fn appear in the upstream region θ 65 160 while it only happens at β 5 in the downstream region for positive pitch the central shaft has an impact on the normal force at all pitch angles and it is marked by the drop happening analogously to the torque trend at around θ 270 it is apparent that the optimal pitch angle allows for reducing the maximum normal load on the blade with respect to the baseline zero pitch since the maximum negative fn peak is delayed by roughly 6 with the amplitude being 11 lower it can be generally stated that the upstream peak of fn as well as the total amplitude of oscillation is progressively reduced as the blade pitch is increased thus resulting in a reduced and more balanced fatigue loading fig 16 presents the sum of the instantaneous force trends acting on all the blades along the x and y directions being representative of the global loadings acting on the whole turbine for fx it is always positive for all different pitch angles since the turbine is pushed backwards fx is the main force on the shaft and on the foundation and it is pivotal for dimensioning the entire machine because it has to resist to the thrust in order not to bend from a perusal of fig 16a it can be noticed that the optimal pitch allows reducing the maximum value of the instantaneous fx by roughly 3 which implies a reduction of the maximum stress acting on the foundation fy force is responsible for the lateral oscillation of the shaft but since the contribution of each individual blade constantly changes in sign during the rotation the effect of different blades can compensate each other increasing the number of blades could help in reducing fy oscillation and in the present case with the five blades the total instantaneous fy is almost constant fig 16c and negligible with respect to the x component especially for the reference and optimized values of β finally table 3 reports the averaged values for the global torque and force components in order to quantify the benefits already pointed out from a qualitative point of view in figs 14 16 in particular it is worth pointing out that the average thrust for the optimal pitch case is 1 9 lower than the reference zero pitch case 5 3 flow field visualization to further clarify the effect of pitch angle on the hydrodynamics of the vamt some useful insights regarding the flow field around the turbine are visualized in this section the vorticity field at tsr 3 0 has been analyzed for three different pitch angles β 2 0 2 fig 17 fluctuations in case of β 2 are less retained than those of pitch angles of 0 and 2 the leeward part is clearly affected by the wakes shed during the upstream part in the streamward zone the blades move towards the water at higher relative velocities and generate much narrower wakes on the other hand on the leeward side of the rotor vortices are shed from the blades and roll up before being convected this results in more intricate flow patterns where the new vortices shed from the incoming blades are convected across traces of vortices shed by the previous blades the flow becomes blurry nevertheless it is still possible to associate each wake to its corresponding blade this can be an explanation for the oscillatory behaviour of the torques and forces at the negative pitches on the blade in figs 12 and 15 these results add more evidence to the confirmation about the optimal operation of the turbine and identify the pitch angles leading to poor turbine performance which need to be avoided 6 conclusions in this paper the influence of the blade pitch angle on the power output structural loadings and hydrodynamics of an h darrieus vertical axis turbine for marine current applications was investigated through numerical calculations using a 2d urans approach the power coefficient trend resulting from the 2d cfd simulations was compared to the outcomes of a lower fidelity 3d vortex model showing a better agreement with experimental data collected in the open field site for the reference turbine the reliability of the optimization analysis through cfd simulations was assessed and validated by the field test considering the reference case of a zero pitch angle therefore a wide range of blade pitch angles was tested on the vamt and the results were analyzed in terms of instantaneous forces fn ft fx fy during its revolution and average loadings on the single blade and the whole turbine a sudden drop area in the downstream region was observed in both the radial and tangent direction of the forces caused by the presence of the wake of the turbine shaft these effects were critical factors during the design process for such the blade pitch and rotor shaft particularly in case of highly pitched blades or large shaft radius in comparison to the turbine radius i e the radius ratio of 5 in this study the main finding of the study was the assessment of the optimal pitch β 2 ensuring a 2 3 higher cp and a 1 9 lower average thrust if compared to the zero referenced pitch also in terms of instantaneous fluctuating loadings the optimal pitch allowed reducing both the maximum peak of the normal force acting on a single blade by 11 and the maximum peak thrust force by 3 this finding can represent a practical solution being at the same time simple and inexpensive in considering an optimal fixed pitch for maximizing the performance while at the same time reducing the hydrodynamic loads on the structure moreover transient cfd analysis showed that the pitch angle has an impact on the strength of the shed vorticity by vamt blades suggesting that a moderate positive pitch i e β 0 2 guarantees a smoother and more stable operation credit authorship contribution statement minh thao nguyen conceptualization

20209,inspired by the curtain wall type breakwater this paper introduced a reversed l type breakwater wec structure which is a rectangular floating breakwater with a vertical curtain wall restrained in piles to present the performance of the new system a numerical model based on n s equations is introduced and validated a numerical study is carried out to illustrate the factors on the hydrodynamic properties and structure loads of the breakwater wec including the pto damping force the wave frequency draft and height of the curtain wall it is found that its performance gets enhanced with a higher curtain wall with the expense of greater structure loads the sensitivity analysis found that the hydrodynamic performance is sensitive to the draft and pto damping force while the height of the curtain wall has the most influence on the restraining moment the smaller draft gives larger capture ratio width cwr but slight larger transmission coefficient c t as well as smaller wave forces and larger wave moment the cwr increases firstly and decreases as a function of pto damping force while c t shows a reverse trend therefore with proper configuration the breakwater wec system can achieve a satisfied level with the cwr 40 and c t 0 35 keywords floating breakwater wave energy converter curtain wall energy capture ratio transmission coefficient wave force 1 introduction as the rising growth of the depletion of fossil fuels and the consequent aggravated environmental pollution sea wave energy is being increasingly regarded as an alternative and promising resource of low emissions in many countries significant efforts have taken place in extracting energy from ocean waves more than one thousand inventions of wave energy device prototypes have been reported and investigated theoretically numerically and experimentally since 1980 among them the point absorber type which oscillates in the vertical direction comprises the majority over 81 of wecs however only few hundreds of these have reached the stage of model testing hayward et al 2012 at present the high construction cost is still a big challenge astariz and iglesias 2015 and the wave energy devices are still far from reaching the stage of real engineering application the cost sharing strategy of combining wecs with marine structures into one installation may be one of the solutions to reduce the construction cost falcão 2010 the integrated marine structures can be breakwater offshore wind turbine or platform the wec device integrated with bottom mounted breakwaters has been studied by many researchers during the last several decades and a comprehensive review is given in mustapa et al 2017 yet bottom mounted breakwaters are not environmental friendly and uneconomical in relatively deep water while floating breakwaters are widely utilized as wave attenuation structures in coastal engineering due to the merits of conventional use good economic efficiency and low environmental impact it is found that floating breakwaters have similar hydrodynamic properties with oscillating buoy wecs besides the motion of the floating breakwater can provide oscillating function to the wecs whilst the wave energy conversion process of the wecs can serve as wave attenuation function of the breakwater thus integrating wec into floating breakwaters has been proposed as a promising way to realize the construction cost reduction and practical engineering applications the idea of integrating wec into floating breakwaters has been exploited by some pioneering researchers numerically and experimentally which is reviewed in zhao et al 2019b he et al 2012 experimentally studied the hydrodynamic performance of a floating breakwater with and without pneumatic chambers and concluded that the pneumatic chambers helped the breakwater more effective for wave protection and hold the potential for wave energy conversion howe et al 2020 experimentally investigated the similar π type floating breakwater oscillating water column wecs in irregular wave spectra and they illustrated that owc device integration provides distinct benefits to the performance of the floating breakwater ning et al 2016 experimentally studied a system integrating pile restrained rectangular box type floating breakwater with an oscillating buoy wec they showed that the capture width ratio cwr the ratio of captured energy and incident wave energy of the system can achieve approximately 24 with the transmission coefficient being lower than 0 50 these studies have proved that the functions of wave energy extraction and wave attenuation can be realized simultaneously in such integrated systems for the floating breakwater wec system both the energy capture efficiency and the transmission coefficient are of interest to the practical application yet it is pointed out that the upper limit of the capture width ratio for one symmetric heaving wec structure is 50 thus the shape of the floating breakwater could be one of the predominant factors to the success of such integrated system recently several studies have been conducted with the emphasis on the geometry optimization of the breakwater wec integration system he et al 2013 experimentally studied the hydrodynamic performance of a floating breakwater with asymmetric chambers and proved that it widened the frequency range for energy extraction chen et al 2020 did a further optimization study of the integrated system of ning et al 2016 on modifying the shape of the floating breakwater numerically for more energy absorption and less wave transmission they found that changing the seaward side straight corner of the rectangular pontoon to a small curve corner can reduce the eddy making damping and enhance significantly wave energy extraction efficiency madhi et al 2014 designed an asymmetric heaving wec called the berkley wedge tbw with one side specially curved to minimize the influence by the viscosity which can serve as a perfect breakwater their experimental results show that this device yields an energy capture efficiency of 82 and a transmission coefficient of 12 5 zhang et al 2019 used a star ccm software to investigate the hydrodynamic performance of the floating box and tbw wec showing that tbw wec always has higher energy capture efficiency and better wave dissipation at long period than the floating box zhang et al 2020 compared the performance of four shapes of floaters including square bottomed triangular bottomed with and without a baffle plate and the berkley wedge and found that the triangular baffle bottom floater could be an ideal coastal structure with the maximum cwr up to 93 the above studies focusing on modifying the shape of the single floating breakwater to improve the performance ning et al 2017 and zhao and ning 2018 compared the hydrodynamic performance of one pontoon and two pontoon breakwater type wec and found that the cwr of a two breakwater system is greater than that of one breakwater system they zhao et al 2019a performed an experiment study on an integrated breakwater wec system which is composed of a heaving oscillating buoy wec attached at the weather side of a fixed breakwater their study proved that the existence of the breakwater significantly improved the performance of the wec and concluded that the draft of the wec and breakwater wec spacing closely affect the heave motion of the wec zhang et al 2020b studied the costal reflection on the performance of a floating breakwater wec system and confirmed that the coastal wall led to significant increment of the efficiency of the system and the cwr could approach 100 in some special cases reabroy et al 2019 investigated an asymmetric floating wec device called by dolphin integrated with a fixed circular breakwater by comparing with different other shapes the authors found that the rao value of the dolphin wec was the best then they analyzed the influence of wave periods on wec motion and power efficiency and concluded that the highest rao value occurred at the natural wave frequency and the cwr could reach to 0 603 zhang et al 2020a concluded that a dual floating breakwater wec hybrid system has better wave attenuation and wave energy extraction capabilities at low wave frequencies and the wec can reduce the wave force on the breakwater researchers zhao et al 2021 tay 2020 also studies the performance of a wec attached to a floating breakwater whose power take off system was installed at the hinge connector that joins the wecs and the fb they found that this system which utilizes the motion energy of the floating breakwater exhibited a qualified wave power extraction performance and wave attenuation performance and had the advantages of less expensive installation and smoother power generation therefore an asymmetric geometry shape of the device or an extra breakwater at the rear side to increase wave reflection or floater motion is necessary to obtain a good hydrodynamic performance although the above studies showed that the slenderness and smoothness of a floating wec are good for the hydrodynamic performance for example the tbw but its height is too large and the curved geometry of the bottom is too complex and therefore it may be difficult and complicated to manufacture and install these structures with a specific asymmetric geometry in practical engineering the dual floating breakwater wec hybrid system may satisfy the industrial construction process and maintain the perfect hydrodynamic performance such as the dolphin model proposed by reabroy et al 2019 yet it needs to combine with an extra breakwater to realize the double functions and thus the double mooring systems may increase the construction cost this pattern is more suitable to construct in front of an existing breakwater in terms of the cost sharing view in coastal protection engineering a curtain wall type breakwater which is composed of a partially immersed vertical plate extending from above the seawater to a depth below the water surface is found to be capable of reflecting the short period waves effectively when its immersion depth is of the order of one half of the water depth to further reduce the height of transmitted wave double and multiple curtain walls breakwater has been proposed and studied liu and li 2011 ji and suh 2010 as for a floating curtain wall the hydrodynamic properties of a floating breakwater with a vertical wave wall attached to its front face restrained by vertical piles williams and mcdougal 2002 are investigated theoretically indicating that acceptable wave reflection may be obtained by varying the parameters of the breakwater wave wall system neelamani and ljubic 2018 experimentally studied the hydrodynamic performance of a floating breakwater with skirt walls showing that adding skirt walls could reduce wave transmission which consequently increased the mooring forces by 10 30 deng et al 2019 used a semi analytical method to investigate the effects of the height and position of the vertical plate on the reflection and transmission coefficient and found that it could enhance the added mass for both surge and pitch modes and it achieved the maximum when installed at the ends of the upper box the goal of this breakwater wave wall system is to reflect and dissipate waves thus to achieve wave height reduction in the lee side of the breakwater when the breakwater combined with a wave energy conversion function the wave energy needs to be captured as more as possible rather than reflecting or dissipating to get a high cwr thus the above proposed breakwaters with curtain walls or skirt walls are not suitable for the integrated breakwater wec system to consider the construction convenience and energy capture efficiency inspired by the curtain wall type breakwater we proposed a reversed l type breakwater wec structure which is a floating rectangular breakwater with a curtain wall attached to its rear face the structure is restrained by vertical piles and can respond only in heave direction we remove the curtain wall on the front face and attach it at the rear side to reduce the outward wave reflection thus the incident wave can propagate under the rectangular pontoon the wave propagates under the rectangular pontoon is partially reflected by the rear curtain wall and transports back the superposition of reflected wave with the incident wave under the rectangular pontoon yields larger waves and increases the heave motion of the floater the kinetic energy of heave motion is converted into electrical energy by a power take off pto system by increasing the kinetic energy of heave motion of the system the energy capture ratio is enhanced consequently compared with the above smoothness of a floating breakwater wec system this combined system may be less efficient in the wave energy capture because the straight corners of the rectangular pontoon and vertical plate may lead to strong eddy making wave energy dissipated and reducing heave motion on the other hand this geometry type consists of a box and a vertical plate and the two parts can be prefabricated and installed separately and therefore it will simplify the manufacture construction process and thus save installation cost the objectives of this study are to investigate the hydrodynamic and power capture performances of this modified breakwater wec integrated structure based on cfd model the equation of motion and energy conversion theory the hydrodynamic properties are presented in this paper the numerical calculations are conducted to illustrate the effects of the various structure parameters such as wave frequency pto damping force height of the curtain wall and draft of the breakwater on the efficiency of the integrated system as a breakwater and wec the efficiency of the integrated system is expressed in terms of the wave attenuation and energy capture efficiency moreover the hydrodynamic loads are of engineering concern for safe and reliable structures thus the surge restraining force and pitch restraining torque on the mounting structures are evaluated in the meantime to provide the foundation for optimal control problem this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the methodologies of the fluid flow equations heave motion equation of the floating body numerical solutions and energy conversion theories section 3 carries out the model validation tests and presents geometric parameters and the cfd calculation conditions based on the numerical calculations the hydrodynamic performance and structural loads influenced by the pto damping force wave frequency the height of the vertical curtain wall and the draft of the rectangular pontoon are analyzed in section 4 conclusions are given in section 5 2 numerical model description 2 1 fluid flow equations a two dimensional incompressible viscous flow is considered to simulate the fluid motion which is governed by the following continuity equation and n s equations 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i 2 μ ρ s i j x j f i where cartesian tensor notation is used x i i 1 2 is the coordinate of a cartesian coordinate system s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i u i i 1 2 means the component of velocity on the axis x i p is pressure ρ and μ are density and viscosity and f i means the body force such as gravity the water air flow involving wave structure interaction is treated as a multi phase flow problem that includes water air and solid body a volume function ϕ m m 1 2 3 denote water air and solid respectively is used to represent and capture the interface satisfying the conditions of 0 ϕ m 1 and ϕ 1 ϕ 2 ϕ 3 1 0 the function is determined by the solution of the following equation of ϕ m 3 φ m t u φ m 0 to ensure the stability at the interface the physical property of the solid is set as the same as the fluid thus the total volume function for the water and solid or air and solid is solved by the following equation 4 φ i 3 t u φ i 3 0 i 1 2 the solid phase ϕ 3 is determined by a lagrangian method in which a fixed rigid body is assumed after each phase is solved the physical property λ such as the density or the viscosity can be averaged for each cell as following hu and kashiwagi 2009 5 λ m 1 3 λ m ϕ m 2 2 floating body motion equation in this study the floating body is treated as a rigid body and restricted in the vertical direction therefore the motion is defined by a translational motion to its mass center its equation in the time domain can be established based on newton s second law of motion as follows 6 m 2 ζ y 2 f y m g f p t o where m is mass of the floater model ζ is the heaving motion in the vertical direction of the floating body f y is the vertical hydrodynamic force acting on the body and f pto is the pto damping force the equation is solved by the fourth order runge kutta method the hydrodynamic force and moment are calculated by integrating the pressure on the body surface as follows 7 f x a p δ i k n k d a f y a p δ i k n k d a m z a p δ i k n k r k d a 2 3 numerical solutions the governing equations are solved on a staggered cartesian grid system the momentum equation eq 2 is separated into three steps by applying a fractional step method including one advection step and two non advection steps the advection step is to calculate the advection term of the right side in eq 2 as following 8 u i t u j u i x j 0 a constrained interpolation profile cip method is employed to solve eq 8 which is a compact high order scheme with less numerical diffusion using two grid points information to construct a third order interpolation of the profile in a cell more details about this method can be found in yabe et al 2001 and hu and kashiwagi 2004 the free surface is captured by the tangent of hyperbola for interface capturing with slope weighting thinc sw scheme proposed by xiao et al 2011 as a kind of volume of fluid vof type method it can keep the sharpness of the interface and significantly improve the geometrical accuracy by reducing the ruffles at the interface the solid boundary is treated as an immersed boundary the wave body interaction is coupled by the fractional area volume obstacle representation favor method proposed by hirt 1993 the effect of a body motion on the flow is considered by imposing the velocity field of the solid body into the flow at the solid boundary hu and kashiwagi 2004 the following equation is introduced to update the local velocity of the fluid domain involving the solid body 9 u u b φ 3 u 1 φ 3 where u is the coupled velocity of the fluid involving the solid body u b is the local velocity of the body and u is the velocity obtained by eq 2 φ 3 is the volume of the solid phase in this model an internal wave maker is utilized to generate waves two sponge layers are arranged at the two ends of the flume to absorb the passing waves therefore the reflected waves from the structure can pass through the wave maker region without disturbing the wave generation and are finally absorbed by the sponge layers the momentum source function is derived by choi and yoon 2009 and li et al 2018 10 s g 2 β x exp β x 2 d ω sin ω t where ω is the wave angular frequency β is the parameter associated with the width of source function d is the source function amplitude which is determined from the target wave characteristics 2 4 energy conversion and wave dissipation there are four types of pto damping linear velocity square snap through and constant pto damping huang et al 2019 studied the optimal average output power of the four pto systems in three degrees of freedom their results showed that the order of the pto systems from the best to worst is snap through pto constant pto linear pto and velocity square pto also in the experiment of ning et al 2016 a coulomb damping model is used in the case of a hydraulic pto they used a current magnetic powder brake system to simulate the coulomb damping force and the results of the damping force exhibits a constant pto force approximately based on the above studied conclusions and considering the convenient parameter definition that there is only one parameter in the constant pto damping force model we chose the constant pto damping force model to simulate the pto system for wave energy extraction in the numerical model the pto damping force f pto directly applied on the floater is in a standard coulomb form where the magnitude of f pto is a constant and the direction is opposite to the floater motion the mechanical power from the wec device in the heaving direction is related to the pto damping force f pto and the velocity in heaving motion u y and is calculated as follows 11 p c 1 t 0 t f p t o u y d t where p c is the captured wave power u y is the velocity of the floater in y direction and u y ζ y and t is the wave period the capture width ratio of the integrated system is defined as the following 12 η e p c p i where p i is the incident wave power expressed as follows theoretically 13 p i 1 16 ρ g h 2 l t 1 4 π h l sinh 4 π h l where ρ is the water density g is the gravitational acceleration h is the wave height l the wave length t is the wave period h is the water depth 2 5 wave reflection and transmission coefficients the reflection coefficient c r and transmission coefficient c t are defined as the ratio of the reflected wave height and incident wave height and the ratio of the transmitted wave height and incident wave height respectively a wave separation method of the two point method of goda is used to separate the incident and reflected waves using the wave elevations of wave gauges g2 g3 the dissipation coefficient c d is defined as the percentage of the energy converted by the wec system and dissipated by the motion of the floater the relationship between these coefficients can be expressed as the following 14 c r 2 c t 2 c d 1 where c r is defined as h r h i c t is defined as h t h i and h r and h t is the reflected wave height and transmitted wave height respectively in addition the heave response amplitude operator hrao the ratio of the heave motion response and the incident wave height marked as hrao ζ h i indicates the integrated floating system response to the incident waves and influence the energy conversion the difference value δ c d η of the dissipation coefficient and capture width ratio representing the energy that transfer to the floater but not be captured by the wec is also analyzed to reveal more regularities in wave energy conversion 3 model validation and applications in this section the ability of the numerical model to simulate regular wave interaction with floating structures is validated then a series of numerical calculations are carried out to investigate the factors that influence the wave dissipation performance and wave energy conversion efficiency of the presented system of floating breakwater integrating wec in this paper aiming to provide guidance for designation of an optimal integrated system with high capture width ratio but low wave transmission at the same time furthermore the restraining forces and moments on the structure are analyzed to estimate the support system of bottom mounting by piles which usually increases with the energy conversion efficiency and thus increases the structural mass and overall cost of the system 3 1 model validation the numerical model we employed is the same with the model used in zhao and hu 2012 where the efficiency and accuracy of the model were validated in a case of regular wave interacting with a 2 d floating body in terms of wave profile floating body motion in heave and pitch therefore we concentrate on the capability of the numerical model to predict the wave force on structures the experiment carried out by rodríguez and spinneken 2016 was used in which a 2 d rectangular pontoon with a width of b 0 4h and draft of d 0 2h suspended from the top of the wave flume is fixed in the middle of wave flume with a constant water depth h 1 25m regular incident waves were generated and interacted with the box and the vertical wave excitation forces were recorded by the load cells connected to the box time histories of the vertical wave excitation force due to regular waves with different wave steepness of ak 0 10 with kd 0 4 0 7 and 1 0 are demonstrated in the reference where k is the wave number and a is the regular wave amplitude more information in detail should be referred to rodríguez and spinneken 2016 fig 1 gives the comparison of the normalized vertical wave excitation force f t ρgad between the numerical model calculation and the experimental results also results of chen et al 2020b is depicted in the figures for better comparison it is evident that there exist pronounced nonlinearities in the wave force traces for kd 1 0 overall the agreement between the numerical model calculations and the experimental results is good in particular our numerical result is slightly lower than the experimental data in the trough which is also seen in the results of chen et al 2020b with a better fitness on the other hand our result fits well with the experimental data in the peak moreover both numerical models predict the nonlinear forcing terms in a satisfied level of accuracy in this way the numerical can be used to calculate the wave forces on the structures rodríguez and spinneken 2016 also carried out experiments allowing the box to heave freely with all other degrees of freedom constrained the heave motions was recorded for the complete set of regular wave cases 0 2 kb 1 2 this hrao is shown in fig 2 where the numerical calculation results red stars line are compared against experimental data black stars line a linear potential flow prediction by wamit green solid line and a time domain td simulation incorporating an additional damping term blue solid line in considering the hrao in fig 2 the agreement between the numerical calculation results experimental data and the linear potential flow prediction is good for cases that are not in proximity of the box resonance frequency kb 0 5 and kb 0 8 however for cases in proximity of the resonance 0 5 kb 0 7 substantial motion discrepancies are observed between linear potential flow predictions and experimental data while only slight reductions are noted for the numerical calculation results the observed motion reductions imply that an additional source of damping is present in the experiments and the linear potential flow fails to predict well instead the good match of the numerical calculation results and the experimental data in proximity of the resonance in fig 2 indicates that this numerical model is indeed adequate to predict the heave motion of a wec integrated floater even in the resonance region since the reflection and transmission coefficients will also be analyzed in the following section we need to validate the capability of the model in computing the profile of the free water surface in the weather side and lee side of the floating body the experiment carried out by peng et al 2013 is used to validate this model in which a 2 d rectangular pontoon with a width of 0 40 m a height of 0 25 m and a length of 0 68 m the total mass and moment of inertia at the center of gravity are 28 6 kg and 0 435 kg m2 respectively the box is moored to the bottom with a 60 inclination by four stainless chains with a submergence depth of 10 2 cm the incident wave is regular with the period t i of 1 0 s and wave height of 4 6 cm the wave gages is located at x 195 cm 120 cm 120 cm 165 cm with the origin at the center of the box fig 3 gives the comparisons of time history of the free surface profiles between our numerical results and experimental data in peng et al 2013 as we can see that our model can calculate the free surface profiles in a satisfactory accuracy in the weather side and lee side of a moored floating body excited by regular waves the nonlinearity of the wave profiles in the lee side is simulated in agreement with the experimental data therefore our model can be used to calculate the reflection and transmission coefficients induced by a moored floater 3 2 numerical model setting and calculation conditions the basic configurations and dimensions of the integrated structure are based on the wec type floating breakwater model investigated by ning et al 2016 with a vertical protruding plate attached in the leeward side of the rectangular pontoon the structure model utilizes froude scaling criterion with the scaling factor of 1 10 compared with the full scale breakwater for better comparison we design a basic model that has the same volume of displacement with the floating breakwater of ning et al 2016 thus the width is b 0 8 m the length is b z 0 78 m the height is d 0 6 m the draft d 0 2425 m the width and height of the vertical curtain wall is b 0 05 m and d p 0 1 m the floating structure is pile restrained at the first third part of the numerical wave flume with a water depth of h 1 0 m shown in fig 4 the dimensions of the flume are 35 m in length with two wave absorbing regions located at each end of the flume to reduce the wave reflection four wave probes positioned in front and back of the floater as shown schematically in fig 4 were used to measure the surface elevation two were placed in front of the floater for separation of the incident wave height h i and reflection wave height h r and the other two in the leeward side of the floater for separation of transmission wave height h t from the waves reflected off the wave absorbing beach the distances between wave gauges are shown in fig 4 the numerical calculations are divided into three categories to investigate the factors influencing the performance of the integrated breakwater wec the wave period and pto damping force the height of the curtain wall and the draft of the floating box during the whole process the still water depth h is fixed at 1 0 m the draft d 0 2425 m except for the cases for the influence of draft targeted incident wave height h i 0 20 m the wave conditions in the numerical calculations are listed in table 1 the corresponding test cases are summarized in table 2 table 4 cases 1 10 in table 2 consider the influence of wave period and pto damping force on the performance of the integrated breakwater wec by setting t at 1 37 s 1 58 s 1 79 s and 2 0 s and f pto at 40 240 n at 20 30 n interval respectively under the three heights of vertical curtain wall d p 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 cases 11 12 in table 3 focus on the influence of the height of the vertical curtain wall on the performance of the integrated breakwater wec cases 13 22 in table 4 study the influence of the draft of the floating box on the performance of the integrated system including five drafts in the configurations of two sets of the curtain wall height and wave period respectively and six sets of pto damping force 3 3 grid convergence test grid convergence were investigated to simulate the periodic wave interacting with the heave motion model in seven grids test1 test7 as shown in table 5 the grids are ununiform in the computational domain and were fined around the structure and the free surface which is listed in table 5 as min δx and min δy the simulation conditions are chosen as case 5 and the damping force is set as f pto 150 n as shown in table 2 the comparison results of heave motion response amplitude operator vertical wave force and the surface elevation at gauges g4 are shown in fig 5 we found that coarse meshes agree with well with fine meshes with respect to heave motions and wave forces except a little difference in the peaks and toughs in wave elevations therefore the grid convergence of the model is satisfied for the sake of computational efficiency and better capture of the wave structure interaction process the finer meshes resolution of 0 4 cm in x direction and 0 1 cm in y direction are adopted in the following computations 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrodynamic performance of the integrated system in this section the results of numerical calculations are analyzed to explore the factors that influence the hydrodynamic performance of the presented floating breakwater integrating wec aiming to provide guidance for designation of an optimal integrated system with high capture width ratio but low wave transmission at the same time the main indices that are used to evaluate the performance are the reflection transmission and dissipation coefficient of the breakwater the heave response of the floater and the energy capture width ratio of the wec devices 4 1 1 influence of wave frequency and pto damping force the pto system is an essential part of a wec in which the pto damping force affects energy captured ratio and the motion of the floater which consequently influence the reflection and transmission of the incident wave studies showed that the wave attenuation performance and wave energy conversion efficiency can be achieved in a certain frequency range with the converter in resonance with waves ning et al 2016 since the resonant frequency of the wec can be adjusted to the incident wave frequency by choosing specific parameters of the pto huang et al 2019 we perform calculations to reveal the influence of the wave frequency and the pto damping force on the hydrodynamic performance of the integrated breakwater wec the influence of the pto damping force is investigated by considering f pto 40 n 80 n 100 n 120 n 150 n 180 n 200 n 220 n 240 n four sets of wave period t 1 37 s 1 58 s 1 79 s and 2 0 s are chosen to reveal the influence of the wave frequency where the correspondence of wave conditions is listed in table 1 the wave height is 0 2 m the draft of the floating box is 0 2425 m and the height of the vertical curtain wall is discussed with three sets of 0 1 m 0 2 m and 0 3 m to ensure the conclusion of generality the curves of the reflection coefficient c r transmission coefficient c t dissipation coefficient c d capture width ratio η e difference value δ c d η e and the heave response amplitude operator hrao as the function of time averaged pto damping force f pto for the configurations shown in table 2 under each tested wave condition in table 1 are illustrated in figs 6 8 it can be seen that c r shows an increasing tendency in almost all waves while it decreases first and then increases with the increase of f pto in the case of kh 1 72 however c t exhibits an opposite trend compared to c r the condition of c t 0 5 can be satisfied for shorter waves of kh 1 42 and for longer waves of kh 1 42 with a larger f pto setting the variation of the cwr η e shows a parabolic trend and the maximum of the η e can be found clearly throughout the range of pto damping force as the wave frequency kh decreases the pto damping force f pto at the peak value of η e increases generally for all the three configurations of the height of the vertical curtain wall d p except for the case of kh 1 72 which may be because this wave frequency is close to the natural frequency of the structure in all the three configurations of d p for the cases of kh 2 20 and 1 72 the transmission coefficient is lower than 0 4 and the peak value of η e 30 can be achieved at the meantime which is similar to the conclusion of ning et al 2016 but has relatively better hydrodynamic performance what is noteworthy is that for the cases of kh 2 20 and 1 72 the transmission coefficient c t is rather stable in the range of 0 2 or 0 35 with varying f pto while the corresponding η e varied significantly with a peak value with an appropriate f pto setting on the other hand for the cases of kh 1 42 and 1 21 the condition of c t 0 5 and η e 30 can be satisfied with the proper pto setting this indicates that this breakwater wec system is more effective for the shorter waves moreover from the variations of η e with wave frequency kh we can see that the peak values of η e were achieved with larger f pto setting as kh decreases this is due to the fact that the wave with lower wave frequency kh carries more wave energy and induces more intense heave motion which can be found in the tendency of hrao thus the optimal f pto needs to be larger to capture as more wave energy as possible for lower frequency waves the dissipation coefficient c d shows an opposite tendency of c r a general decreasing trend with the f pto increasing it is worth noting that for all the three d p configurations the c d in the case of kh 1 72 is larger than that of the other wave frequency cases with the same d p setting which is similar with the trend of η e this may be induced by the resonance of waves and the integrated system although the system in the case of kh 1 72 achieves the maximum η e of all the wave frequency cases the heave motion response hrao in this case nonetheless does not reach the largest motion which is different from our general knowledge of the resonance since c d is defined as the percentage of the energy converted by the wec system and dissipated by the motion of the floater and the converted energy also comes from the potential kinetic energy of heave motion of the floater therefore from the tendency of η e we can conclude that the resonance energy has been transferred by the wec system leading to the fact that the hrao increases regularly with the wave frequency decreasing hence we can conclude that the energy converted by the wec system plays a more important role in the energy dissipation of the breakwater wec the coefficient δ c d η e represents the energy dissipated by the motion of the floater which includes the kinetic energy of the floater represented by hrao and the external damping energy caused by viscous damping and friction loss the variation of δ shows a fast decreasing tendency with the increase of f pto firstly and a small rising trend at the high f pto setting lastly opposite to the trend of η e with a larger transition point of f pto as the hrao shows a constant decreasing trend it can be concluded that the external damping increases with the increasing f pto at the high f pto range moreover the trend of the variations of δ with the wave frequency are similar to that of the c d different from that of hrao implying that the external damping is also significant at the resonance specially from the comparisons of the trend of variations of η e and c t with the f pto we can find that the f pto setting reaching the minimum of c t is larger than that achieving the maximum of η e although the two f pto settings are large for example for the case of kh 1 72 and d p 0 1 m the f pto with minimum of c t is 220n while the f pto with maximum of η e is 150n the variations of c t in the range of f pto 150 220n is small from 0 36 to 0 31 on the contrary the η e varies significantly from 40 to 24 this means that the two functions of wave energy utilization and wave energy attenuation cannot achieve their optimal performance simultaneously but as a compromise there may exist a configuration for which the cwr and transmission coefficient of the integration breakwater wec meet a satisfied level by comparing the three heights d p of the curtain wall it is seen straightforwardly that a better performance of η e and c t are obtained for a higher curtain wall which will be discussed more in the following section the pto damping force f pto achieving the maximum of η e increases with the increase of d p and the influence is more intense for smaller wave frequency kh specifically the maximum of η e for the case of kh 2 20 does not have an obvious increase with the increase of d p from d p 0 1 to d p 0 2 while the maximum of η e for the case of kh 1 72 increases from η e max 0 40 to η e max 0 48 with the increase of d p from d p 0 1 to d p 0 2 and that for the case of kh 1 42 increases from η e max 0 42 to η e max 0 49 with the increase of d p from d p 0 2 to d p 0 3 moreover the hydrodynamic performance is more stable with variations of f pto for the configuration of higher value of d p and it maintains a high level of η e 35 and c t 0 5 over a range of f pto particularly for a higher curtain wall d p 0 3 the η e of three wave frequency cases achieves almost the same level indicating that the wave frequency has little influence on the energy capture ratio width η e therefore from this point of the view the configurations of higher curtain wall d p 0 3 are more flexible and adaptive to the complex ocean environment since the actual waves are random and the wave frequency varies in a range 4 1 2 influence of the height of the vertical curtain wall to further illustrate the relationship of the hydrodynamic performance of the integrated breakwater wec system and the height of the curtain wall we performed the calculations of cases 11 and 12 in table 3 to consider the height of the curtain wall d p 0 0 0 6 m d p d 0 2 5 with the results shown in fig 9 it can be seen that as intuitively expected the curtain wall has a considerable influence on wave transmission and energy capture as the height of the curtain wall is increased the transmission coefficient c t drops dramatically and the wave energy cwr η e goes up significantly for example in the case of f pto 150 n increasing the curtain wall from d p d 0 4 to d p d 2 0 decreases the transmission coefficient c t from 0 36 to 0 08 and increases the cwr η e by twice and more specifically the runup trend of the cwr η e keeps up till some height of the curtain wall and then turns into a slow growth for the case of f pto 150 n the transition height is d p d 1 24 and for the case of f pto 200 n the transition height is d p d 2 0 this indicates that the enhancement effect on the hydrodynamic performance brought by the height of the curtain wall has a limit and the enhancement is more significant for a larger pto damping force it is understood that the waves are surface waves whose energy is concentrated in a limited depth under the water surface and the influence diameter of the wave motion decreases in a deeper water region comparing the cases of f pto 150 n and f pto 200 n we can find that the hydrodynamic performance for case f pto 150 n in terms of c r c t c d and η e is better than that of case f pto 200 n in the low height curtain wall range d p d 1 6 while in the high height curtain wall range d p d 1 6 an inverse trend is observed that the coefficients of c t and η e for case f pto 200 n are larger this indicates that although a higher curtain wall may enhance the performance of wave energy capture it needs a larger pto damping force to match up which may increase the force acting on the support structure and thus add construction cost 4 1 3 influence of the draft of the floating breakwater to illustrate the influence of the draft of the floating box on the hydrodynamic performance of the integrated breakwater wec four drafts are investigated for two sets of wave frequency and curtain wall height see cases 13 22 in table 4 the values of the draft of the floating box with a vertical curtain wall in this study are determined to have the same displacement with the floating breakwater wec d h 0 20 0 25 0 27 and 0 30 studied by ning et al 2016 it should be noted that as the draft of the floating box changes the mass of the floater increases to make sure that it is a free floating breakwater in still water the rest of the parameters maintains the same with the initial tests the variations of reflection coefficients c r transmission coefficient c t dissipation coefficient c d capture width ratio η e difference value δ c d η e and the heave response amplitude operator hrao as the function of time averaged pto damping force f pto are shown in fig 10 fig 12 it can be seen that the variations of c r c t η e and hrao with the draft d are all similar for different cases which means that changing the draft in a small range does not significantly modify the variation trend of these parameters as the function of f pto specifically the larger draft d leads to a larger reflection coefficient and smaller transmission coefficient because the blockage effect of the front wall of the floating breakwater is more evident as the draft increases as has also been observed by ning et al 2016 this can also be explained by the trend of hrao that the heave response hrao decreases with the increasing of the draft d as it becomes heavier and hence less energy pass through the floating breakwater and more energy are reflected back the hrao of the wec devices are also discussed by zhao et al 2019a that it increases with the increasing draft in which the cylindrical wec devices are equally spaced on the weather side of the breakwater the two distinctly different trends may result from the different geometries and layouts revealing that it needs to be investigated for each specific geometry although the difference value δ shows no same trend with the draft for different cases the capture width ratio η e decreases as the draft increases for all three cases because the converted energy mainly comes from the kinetic energy of the floater this trend means that although the floater gets heavier as the draft increases the heave response hrao decreases greatly and offset the bonus of the increased mass of the floater on the kinetic energy indicating that the hrao of the floater plays a significant role in the wave energy capture process rather than the draft as for the trend of the variations of these coefficients with f pto for different drafts for two sets of curtain wall height with the same wave frequency kh 2 2 see figs 10 and 11 we can conclude that the variations of these coefficients of c r c t c d η e δ and hrao with f pto for d p 0 1 m is similar to that of the case of d p 0 2 m for two sets of wave frequency with the same curtain wall height see figs 11 and 12 we can observe that the trends of the c d coefficient for the case of kh 1 72 differ from that of the case of kh 2 2 characterized as increasing firstly and then decreasing which causes the small difference of η e with the drafts at small pto damping force range yet these differences are not such great that the capture width ratio η e exhibits similar tendency for the three sets where an optimal f pto can be identified moreover the optimal f pto of different drafts behaves differently with the variation of wave frequency at the wave frequency kh 2 2 a larger draft needs a smaller optimal f pto to achieve a maximum η e whereas the optimal f pto dose not alter with the drafts at the wave frequency kh 1 72 4 1 4 sensitivity analysis of the hydrodynamic performance in order to compare the influence effect of the pto damping force f pto draft d and curtain wall height d p on the hydrodynamic performance of the integrated device the sensitivity analysis of the hydrodynamic performance of c t and η e with respect to the f pto d and d p has been carried out for fair comparison the cases in section 4 1 3 are considered in this section the sensitivity coefficient is defined as 15 k c t δ c t c t i δ x i x i 16 k η e δ η e η e i δ x i x i where the δc t and δη e is calculated as the difference between the best performance and worst performance of the cases in one set therefore the sensitivity coefficients of d and f pto are analyzed under different configurations of pto damping force and draft separately for example the sensitivity coefficients of d are analyzed under different conditions f pto 80 100 120 150 180 n in the three configurations which are drawn as the columns filled in with pure colors in fig 13 and similarly the sensitivity coefficients of f pto are analyzed under different conditions d 0 20 0 25 0 27 0 30 m the draft of the box that has the same displacement with the floater attached the curtain wall in the three configurations which are drawn as the columns filled in with pure colors and oblique lines in fig 13 the sensitivity coefficients of d p are analyzed under different configurations of drafts d at a fixed pto damping force f pto 150 n which appropriately have a relatively good performance in c t and η e from fig 13 we can see that the sensitivity coefficients of d are the largest among the three factors meaning that the draft d has the most significant influence on the hydrodynamic performance of c t and η e specifically the dramatic difference is more noticeable in the performance of c t and it does not alter a lot as the change of curtain wall height d p which coincides with our cognition that the draft of the floating breakwater has a great influence on the wave dissipation while for the performance of η e the dramatic difference alters with the wave frequency kh and curtain wall height d p particularly the difference between d and f pto is almost negligible in the configuration of kh 1 72 d p 0 2 m it implies that the influence of draft on the performance of η e is less significant for a longer wave and the optimal energy capture width ratio can be tuned by the other factors the sensitivity coefficients of f pto show an opposite trend to that of d that the influence of f pto on the performance of η e is more significant than that of c t this may be relative to the fact that the damping force is directly related to the energy capture efficiency in detail the sensitivity coefficients of f pto on η e decrease with the increase of d p and decrease of kh while they increase with the increase of d p on c t and have no much variations with the change of kh this is beneficial for tuning the optimal performance of the integrated device because the f pto does not alter the transmission coefficient a lot and thus the influence factors may be decoupled to some extent the sensitivity coefficients of d p on the performance of η e and c t are much smaller than that of d barely accounting for a half of the level of d this is because that the two drafts of d p and d have different widths leading to different displacements which affects the device motion in different degrees and thus affects the performance of η e and c t differently consequently although the sensitivity coefficients of d p is not as large as that of d from the view of engineering economy the curtain wall height d p may still have its competitive edge in the ways of the effect on the performance of η e and c t it behaves in a similar way to that of d p the way that the c t is more sensitive than η e to the factors of the two drafts of d p and d 4 2 restraining forces and moments on the mounting structure for this kind of pile restrained floating structures a mounting structure should be designed to support the floater as shown in fig 4 because the floater is restricted to motion in heave direction the mounting structure must handle the reaction force and moment in surge and pitch direction induced by hydrodynamic and hydrostatic forces to achieve zero surge and pitch at all time thus a force and moment analysis are conducted to obtain an estimation of the force and moment acting on the floater in surge and pitch direction they can be represented by an equivalent force and moment at the centroid of the floating breakwater which are normalized by the formula of f x f x ρ g h b b z f y f y ρ g h b b z and m z m z ρ g h b 2 b z ρ is the water density h is the wave height and b and b z is the width of the floater in x and z direction respectively here f x f y and m z denotes the significant value f 1 3 of the calculated maximums of wave force or moment acting on the floater for a wave condition occurred in the time histories where the gravity of the floater is subtracted from f y the value f 1 3 can be given as f 1 3 1 n 3 i 1 n 3 f i where n is the total number of the wave actions f i is the sorted largest amplitude of wave force or moment moreover to provide more information for the design and fatigue evaluation of the structural strength the wave pressure at different positions of the floating breakwater is calculated and analyzed six pressure points are chosen to measure the wave pressure p on the surface of the floating body the detailed locations of the pressure points are shown in fig 14 the pressure is also normalized by the similar method of f x f y and m z with the formula of p p ρ g h fig 15 show the time series of the non dimensional wave pressure p at positions 1 6 located on the seaward surface bottom and curtain wall of the floater for the case of kh 1 72 d p 0 2m d 0 235m with f pto 60n and 150n we chose this case because that η e gets the smallest and largest value at the pto damping force for this case as shown in fig 12 and it is meaningful to understand the variation of the pressure on the floater with the variation of f pto we can see that pto damping force has a moderate effect on the pressure of positions 1 3 and has little effect on the pressure of positions 4 6 in detail the pressure decreases with the increase of pto damping force on the seaward surface of the floater and increases with the increase of pto damping force on the backward bottom of the floater represented by 5 this is probably related with the standing wave in front of the floater which may increase with the increase of the reflection coefficient as the pto damping force increases this tendency varies with kh and is discussed more detailly in zhao et al 2017 the slight increase of the pressure on position 5 with the increase of pto damping force may be due to the decrease of the transmission coefficient and the superposition of incident and reflected waves by the curtain wall we will discuss if this trend fits all the cases on some positions in the following sections another fact that should be noted is that the pressure time series at all six points are periodic but they are not simple harmonic periodic the shapes of pressure at positions 1 3 have a flat wave trough and steep wave crest as a stokes wave which is related with the superposition of incident and reflected waves in front of the floater while the shapes of pressure at positions 4 6 have a second order harmonic wave this may be attributed to the vortices around the corner induced by the vertical curtain wall which may dominate the flow field 4 2 1 influence of wave frequency and pto damping force the results of the wave exciting heave force the restraining surge force and pitching moment and the pressure on the floater as a function of time averaged pto damping force f pto for the wave conditions shown in table 2 are illustrated in figs 16 18 we note that the exciting heave force f y and restraining pitching moment m z are affected significantly by the pto damping force f pto while the restraining surge force f x does not change with the f pto in most wave frequencies f y shows a tendency of decreasing firstly and then increasing for most cases implying that a large motion with small restriction in heave causes a larger wave force in heave than that with a properly restricted motion which is interestingly the reverse tendency of η e in figs 6 8 this coincidence indicates that the η e may have a close connection with the wave exciting heave force f y on the floater and gets the maximum when f y reaches the bottom this gives us a good expectation that the minimum wave exciting heave force and maximum wave energy capture ratio can be achieved simultaneously which is beneficial to the structure safety and facility function realization if the f pto is adjusted properly m z shows a decreasing tendency as the f pto increases which is the joint effect of the f x and f y in all the three configurations of d p the restraining wave forces of the cases of kh 1 42 and 1 72 are larger than the other cases especially for the case of kh 1 72 d p 0 3 m in this case the f x increases dramatically with the increase of f pto among all the wave frequencies the case of kh 1 72 has the maximum f y and f x but a relatively small m z this may be related with the resonance of the floater with the incident wave as we concluded from the figures in figs 6 8 that the case of kh 1 72 gets the maximum η e this means that we need to pay an extra greater structural load for maximizing power absorption as discussed in detail by tom et al 2019 we give the nondimensional wave pressure amplitude at the points 4 6 on the bottom of the floating box and the seaward surface of the curtain wall as can be seen from figs 16 18 the pto damping force affects the wave pressure in different ways in particular at the position 4 close to the front the variation of the wave pressure at point 4 as a function of f pto shows a trend of a decrease first and a following increase for the most wave conditions except for the case of kh 1 72 d p 0 1 m and kh 1 42 d p 0 2 m this point 4 has an approximate position with point 3 in zhao et al 2017 where the pressure shows a slight increasing tendency with the f pto increasing this difference mainly derives from the added curtain wall in the leeward side of the floating box which causes a reflection wave in front of the curtain wall and may form a standing wave with the superposition of an incident wave at point 6 the same trend occurs but a smaller value this may possibly be attributed to the vortices stronger near the position around the corner which may have significant contribution to the flow field at point 5 on the latter section of the bottom the wave pressure increases slightly with the increase of f pto implying that the more restriction the pto imposes on the floater the higher pressure point 5 bears among the three pressure points wave pressure on point 4 is twice as the other points indicating that we should pay special attention to this section and check its safety in design 4 2 2 influence of the height of the vertical curtain wall fig 19 depicts the influence of the height of the curtain wall d p on wave forces wave moment and wave pressure of the floater as we can see that the wave force and moment f y f x m z show an increasing tendency as the dimensionless height of the vertical curtain wall d p d increases for both selected f pto however the pressures p on the floating breakwater do not show an identity of tendencies since the pressure at point 4 is relatively unaffected by d p d while the pressure at point 6 has a more evident increasing trend with the increase of d p d checking their positions we can figure out that the point 4 is in the front zone of the floater bottom which is farther away from the curtain wall while the point 6 is on the curtain wall a place where the pressure is directly influenced by the interference effect on wave transmission of the curtain wall this gives us a conclude that a high curtain wall would deduce a high pressure on the curtain wall and that will increase the fracture risk of the curtain wall particularly we find that the f y f x m z and p for f pto 150 n has a transition that the increasing trend becomes decreasing as the d p d increases at the value of d p d 2 0 which coincides with the tendency of η e in section 4 1 2 this confirms our conjecture in section 4 1 2 that the increase of the height of the curtain wall has a limit influence on the hydrodynamic performance in terms of energy capture ration and wave force by comparing the results of f pto 150 n and f pto 200 n we can find that the influence of pto is not so significant as we expected in section 4 1 2 for the wave forces of f y the result of larger pto damping force of f pto 200 n is greater firstly and then smaller than that of the smaller pto damping force of f pto 150 n and a reverse trend exists in the f x whereas for the wave moment of m z the result of f pto 200 n is a little smaller than that of f pto 150 n except for d p d 2 5 nevertheless as our attention is on the restraining force on the mounting structure the f x m z are the most concern the wave fore f x for the large pto of f pto 200 n is slightly larger than that of f pto 150 n in the higher height curtain wall range d p d 0 8 coinciding with the conjecture in section 4 1 2 that a lager pto damping force may increase the force acting on the mounting structure as regards the wave moment in pitch m z that does not conform to the trend we consider that might be because that the point of the wave moment m z in our calculation is located at the centroid of the floating box which keeps moving with the motion of the floating box and so that it may not reflect the wave moment acting on the mounting structure completely 4 2 3 influence of the draft of the floating breakwater figs 20 22 show the influence of the draft of the floater on wave forces wave moment and wave pressure of the integrated breakwater wec as we can see in the three configurations the draft of the floater has significant effect on the wave force in x direction while not much influences are found in the wave force in y direction and wave moment more specifically the wave force f x with the larger draft have a larger value indicating that wave force in x direction increases with the increase of the draft on the other hand the wave moment m z with the smaller height of curtain wall does not clearly get affected by the draft yet as the height of the vertical curtain wall d p increases d p 0 2 the influence becomes evident that the largest draft has the smallest wave moment which is opposite to the trend of the wave force in x direction the wave force in y direction with the largest draft is the largest of all drafts at kh 1 72 d p 0 2 m which may be caused by the resonance corresponding to the behavior of wave forces the pressures at positions 2 are affected much significantly by the draft in a similar way to the wave force f x while the pressures at position 5 and 6 are less influenced by the draft as similar to that of the wave force f y however the pressures with larger draft are not always the largest as shown in figs 20 and 21 the trend is converse that the pressures increase with the increase of the draft in fig 22 which is a low wave frequency with a higher curtain wall as for the role of wave frequency and height of the vertical curtain wall the height of the vertical curtain wall has little influence on the pressure at positions 2 and 5 moderate influence on the pressure at position 6 as shown in figs 20 and 21 whereas the wave frequency kh plays an important role in pressures especially at point 2 as shown in figs 21 and 22 interestingly the variation of pressure at position 6 as a function of pto damping force has changed into a decreasing trend from an increasing trend as the wave frequency kh decreases from 2 2 to 1 72 this may be contributed by the resonant phenomenon of the incident wave and the floater 4 2 4 sensitivity analysis of the restraining force and moment as illustrated in section 4 1 4 the influence sensitivity analyses of the pto damping force f pto draft d and curtain wall height d p on the restraining force f x and moment m z of the integrated device are carried out in a similar way to section 4 1 4 and the results are shown in fig 23 as seen in fig 23 in the aspect of restraining force f x the sensitivity coefficients of d are the largest of the three factors meaning that the draft d has the most significant influence on f x which is like the trend of the hydrodynamic performance on the contrary in the aspect of restraining moment m z the sensitivity coefficients of d p are the largest of the three factors different from the trend of the hydrodynamic performance this is because that the curtain wall enhances the arm of force and thus increases the wave moment on the device as expected the sensitivity coefficients of pto damping force on restraining force f x are the smallest since the pto damping force is acted in the y direction also that of the height of the curtain wall are small because the wave energy is mainly concentrated on the surface and the water particle velocities are small in the zone of the curtain wall on the other hand the sensitivity coefficients of the draft d on restraining force f x increase with the decrease of the wave frequency because a longer wave has more wave energy and thus larger wave force on the device implying that the wave frequency has evident influence on the restraining force f x and that on restraining moment m z decreases with the increase of the height of curtain wall this means that although the restraining moment m z is sensitive to the height of curtain wall in a large extent the effect is reduced as the increase of the height of curtain wall this is conducive to the design of a higher curtain wall since it can enhance the hydrodynamic performance of the device 4 3 fluid domain and vortex in order to investigate the wave dissipation and wave reflection characteristics during the incident wave interaction with the floating breakwater wec structure the fluid field domain and vortex evolution is discussed in this section according to the above discussion it is found that the floating breakwater wec system gets relatively good performance in the configuration of kh 1 72 d p 0 3 m f pto 150 n in case 8 so that we choose this case to illustrate the flow characteristics besides to elaborate the benefit of this modified geometry comparing with the original geometries we calculated the cases of the rectangular pontoon geometry and the traditional curtain wall breakwater with a front curtain wall attached to the rectangular pontoon for a thorough understanding the calculated hydrodynamic performance coefficients for these three geometries are listed in table 6 we can see that the front curtain wall geometry has the largest reflection coefficient and smallest transmission coefficient of the three implying that this traditional curtain wall breakwater has best performance as a breakwater however as we predicted in the introduction its wave energy capture ratio is so small that the wave energy conversion function could almost be neglectable therefore this geometry is not suitable for the integration of the breakwater and energy capture the modified geometry rear curtain wall shifting curtain wall at the rear side of the box exhibits an optimal hydrodynamic performance with a largest energy capture ratio and smallest transmission coefficient compared to the rectangular geometry the rear curtain wall geometry enhances the energy capture ratio by 65 and reduces the transmission coefficient by 36 implying that the modified geometry could enhance the hydrodynamic performance and is a preferable choice for the breakwater integrated with wave energy capture function based on the velocity fields of the above cfd simulations the vorticity is obtained by calculating the curl of the velocity field as the following 17 ω u j x i u i x j according to the definition the negative vorticity has the clockwise circulation and the positive has the anticlockwise circulation the vorticity velocity and pressure field at four different moments of an entire period is shown in fig 24 and fig 25 it is observed that the vortices generate and move away at the corners of the structure when the floater is moving upward from a normal position a strong anticlockwise vortex is generated at the left corner of the rectangular pontoon and a small clockwise vortex is generated at the right corner of the vertical curtain wall see fig 24 a the vortices are the origins of the drag force of the motion and dissipate the wave energy at the same time a low pressure area is observed at the core of the two vortices see fig 25 a which is the source of the downstream convection of the eddy as the floater moves upward the larger anticlockwise eddy is convected downstream under the bottom of the rectangular pontoon and the smaller clockwise eddy gets rising at the rear side of the vertical curtain wall see fig 24 b from fig 25 b it is seen that the fluid under the bottom of the rectangular pontoon is separated into two parts one part is reflected backward as like a reflected wave the other part moves downward and passes across the edge of the curtain wall as like a transmitted wave this process explains why the transmission coefficient of this geometry is smaller than that of the rectangular floating breakwater similarly when the floater is moving downward from a normal position a strong clockwise vortex is generated at the left corner of the rectangular pontoon and a small anticlockwise vortex is generated at the right corner of the vertical curtain wall due to the flow separation see fig 24 c at the same time a negative pressure area is observed at the core of the two vortices see fig 25 c which leads the eddy to convect upward along the front of the floating box see figs 24 d and fig 25 d at this stage the backward flow of the fluid under the bottom of the floating box is more significant see fig 25 c which is the result of the reflection of the vertical curtain wall and the wave downward motion this process is so strong that it causes a plunging backward wave breaking process in front of the floater which dissipates the wave energy see fig 24 d fig 26 and fig 27 show the vorticity velocity and pressure fields around the front curtain wall geometry in the same configuration of f pto 150 n d p 0 3 m in case 8 under the wave frequency of kh 1 72 it can be seen that two vortices occur around the curtain wall one large clockwise vortex in front of the curtain wall and one small anticlockwise at the tip of the thin curtain wall as shown in fig 26 b and c also a low pressure zone appears at the tip of the thin curtain wall as shown in fig 27 b and c driven by the pressure difference as the floater moves downward the anticlockwise vortex is extruded out and merges with the clockwise vortex in front of the curtain wall fig 26 d rolling up to the water surface fig 26 a comparing figs 24 25 and figs 26 27 we can see that most flow separations happen in front of the curtain wall where the velocities of u and v are much larger than that of other zones thus there are no vortices at the bottom of the rectangular pontoon and only a negligible vortex at the rear corner of the rectangular pontoon in addition the water elevation in front of the floater in fig 26 a is much higher than that in fig 24 a implying that the reflection of the front curtain wall geometry is larger than that of the rear curtain wall geometry this explains why the transmission coefficient of this geometry is little at the meantime the v velocity at the bottom of the rectangular pontoon is nearly zero different from that in figs 24 and 25 that the velocity at the bottom of the rectangular pontoon is relative larger and even comparable to the velocity in front of the floater consequently the motion of device the is weak leading to a small wave energy capture ratio fig 28 and fig 29 show the vorticity velocity and pressure fields around the rectangular pontoon without a curtain wall in the same configuration of f pto 150 n in case 8 under the wave frequency of kh 1 72 as we can see the heave motion of this rectangular geometry is smaller than that of the rear curtain wall geometry but larger than that of the of the front curtain wall geometry fig 28 b and d this may be explained by the flow velocity fields under the bottom of the rectangular pontoon as expected the u velocity of the rectangular geometry is much larger than that of the rear curtain wall geometry and no reflection exists while the opposite trend is observed in the v velocity consequently less wave energy is converted into the heave motion of the floater and more wave energy is transmitted behind the floater hence the transmission coefficient is larger than that of the rear curtain wall geometry additionally the vortices and pressure of this rectangular geometry have almost the same pattern with that of the rear curtain wall geometry with a slightly stronger vortex at the rear side corner of the floaters consequently more energy is dissipated and less energy is captured by the pto system leading to a less energy capture width ratio compared to the rear curtain wall geometry 5 conclusions and remarks the hydrodynamic properties of an integrated system combining an asymmetric floating breakwater and a wave energy converter have been investigated numerically the asymmetric floating breakwater is a floating pontoon with a vertical curtain wall attached in the leeward side of the floating pontoon the structure is partially restrained by vertical piles and can respond only in heave a numerical model based on n s equations was employed and developed to simulate the hydrodynamic performance of the wec type floating breakwater in regular waves the pto damping force characteristics were specially investigated in this paper fluid domain and vortices are analyzed and compared among three geometries of the floaters to give a thorough understanding the sensitivity analysis of the influence factors has been done results have been presented that illustrate the effect of the incident wave frequency draft of the pontoon height of the vertical curtain wall and the pto damping force on the performance of the wec type floating breakwater the following conclusions can be drawn from this study 1 the pto damping force have a significant effect on the reflection transmission and dissipation coefficients and the cwr of the integrated system the lowest transmission coefficient and largest cwr cannot be achieved simultaneously at the same pto damping force thus there may exist a value of the pto damping force to get the system an optimum performance the wave exciting heave force reaches its trough at the optimal pto damping force with a maximum cwr the wave forces get the maximum at the resonance frequency of the floater with the incident wave pressure on the front of the bottom of the floater is larger than that on the back and the curtain wall wave pressure at the front of the bottom and on the curtain wall as a function of f pto shows a trend of a decrease first and a following increase for most cases 2 a higher curtain wall keeps the hydrodynamic performance more stable with the variations of pto damping force and wave frequency the performance of the system gets enhanced with a higher curtain wall but the increase rate decreases as the increase of the height of the curtain wall and a higher curtain wall needs a larger pto damping force to match up meanwhile the wave forces and wave moment acting on the floater maintain a constant increase rate and have a transition at a relatively large height of the curtain wall this implies that the performance enhancement will cause greater structure loads but the influence has a limit the pto damping force has little influence on wave forces and moment 3 the larger draft d leads to a larger reflection coefficient smaller transmission coefficient and heave motion but a smaller cwr in other words increasing the draft is not definitely a better choice for the comprehensive performance of the system the optimal pto damping force dose not alter much with the variation of the draft wave forces in x direction increase with the increase of the draft while not much influences are found in the wave force in y direction the wave moment is not influenced by the draft at a small height of curtain wall yet the largest draft gets the smallest wave moment at a higher curtain wall the wave pressure on the tip of the curtain wall experiences a transition from an increasing into a decreasing trend with the variation of pto damping force pto damping force as the wave frequency kh decreases from 2 2 to 1 72 4 in the aspect of the performance of transmission coefficient and cwr the sensitivity of the draft is the largest of the three factors whose influence on transmission coefficient does not alter much with the variations of the wave frequency and height of curtain wall but decreases with the increase of the height of curtain wall and decrease of the wave frequency on the influence of cwr the pto damping force has a relatively large influence on cwr but a small influence on transmission coefficient in the aspect of the performance of restraining force and moment the draft has the most influence on the restraining force in x direction while the height of curtain wall has the most influence on the restraining moment the sensitivity coefficients of the draft on restraining force increase with the decrease of the wave frequency and that on restraining moment decreases with the increase of the height of curtain wall the potential for cooperation between wave energy utilization and coastal protection has been demonstrated the findings of this study can provide guidance for practical engineering design of the modified geometric shape of combining wave energy conversion and floating breakwater the cost sharing and manufacture convenience achieved through the integrated system may help make wave

20209,inspired by the curtain wall type breakwater this paper introduced a reversed l type breakwater wec structure which is a rectangular floating breakwater with a vertical curtain wall restrained in piles to present the performance of the new system a numerical model based on n s equations is introduced and validated a numerical study is carried out to illustrate the factors on the hydrodynamic properties and structure loads of the breakwater wec including the pto damping force the wave frequency draft and height of the curtain wall it is found that its performance gets enhanced with a higher curtain wall with the expense of greater structure loads the sensitivity analysis found that the hydrodynamic performance is sensitive to the draft and pto damping force while the height of the curtain wall has the most influence on the restraining moment the smaller draft gives larger capture ratio width cwr but slight larger transmission coefficient c t as well as smaller wave forces and larger wave moment the cwr increases firstly and decreases as a function of pto damping force while c t shows a reverse trend therefore with proper configuration the breakwater wec system can achieve a satisfied level with the cwr 40 and c t 0 35 keywords floating breakwater wave energy converter curtain wall energy capture ratio transmission coefficient wave force 1 introduction as the rising growth of the depletion of fossil fuels and the consequent aggravated environmental pollution sea wave energy is being increasingly regarded as an alternative and promising resource of low emissions in many countries significant efforts have taken place in extracting energy from ocean waves more than one thousand inventions of wave energy device prototypes have been reported and investigated theoretically numerically and experimentally since 1980 among them the point absorber type which oscillates in the vertical direction comprises the majority over 81 of wecs however only few hundreds of these have reached the stage of model testing hayward et al 2012 at present the high construction cost is still a big challenge astariz and iglesias 2015 and the wave energy devices are still far from reaching the stage of real engineering application the cost sharing strategy of combining wecs with marine structures into one installation may be one of the solutions to reduce the construction cost falcão 2010 the integrated marine structures can be breakwater offshore wind turbine or platform the wec device integrated with bottom mounted breakwaters has been studied by many researchers during the last several decades and a comprehensive review is given in mustapa et al 2017 yet bottom mounted breakwaters are not environmental friendly and uneconomical in relatively deep water while floating breakwaters are widely utilized as wave attenuation structures in coastal engineering due to the merits of conventional use good economic efficiency and low environmental impact it is found that floating breakwaters have similar hydrodynamic properties with oscillating buoy wecs besides the motion of the floating breakwater can provide oscillating function to the wecs whilst the wave energy conversion process of the wecs can serve as wave attenuation function of the breakwater thus integrating wec into floating breakwaters has been proposed as a promising way to realize the construction cost reduction and practical engineering applications the idea of integrating wec into floating breakwaters has been exploited by some pioneering researchers numerically and experimentally which is reviewed in zhao et al 2019b he et al 2012 experimentally studied the hydrodynamic performance of a floating breakwater with and without pneumatic chambers and concluded that the pneumatic chambers helped the breakwater more effective for wave protection and hold the potential for wave energy conversion howe et al 2020 experimentally investigated the similar π type floating breakwater oscillating water column wecs in irregular wave spectra and they illustrated that owc device integration provides distinct benefits to the performance of the floating breakwater ning et al 2016 experimentally studied a system integrating pile restrained rectangular box type floating breakwater with an oscillating buoy wec they showed that the capture width ratio cwr the ratio of captured energy and incident wave energy of the system can achieve approximately 24 with the transmission coefficient being lower than 0 50 these studies have proved that the functions of wave energy extraction and wave attenuation can be realized simultaneously in such integrated systems for the floating breakwater wec system both the energy capture efficiency and the transmission coefficient are of interest to the practical application yet it is pointed out that the upper limit of the capture width ratio for one symmetric heaving wec structure is 50 thus the shape of the floating breakwater could be one of the predominant factors to the success of such integrated system recently several studies have been conducted with the emphasis on the geometry optimization of the breakwater wec integration system he et al 2013 experimentally studied the hydrodynamic performance of a floating breakwater with asymmetric chambers and proved that it widened the frequency range for energy extraction chen et al 2020 did a further optimization study of the integrated system of ning et al 2016 on modifying the shape of the floating breakwater numerically for more energy absorption and less wave transmission they found that changing the seaward side straight corner of the rectangular pontoon to a small curve corner can reduce the eddy making damping and enhance significantly wave energy extraction efficiency madhi et al 2014 designed an asymmetric heaving wec called the berkley wedge tbw with one side specially curved to minimize the influence by the viscosity which can serve as a perfect breakwater their experimental results show that this device yields an energy capture efficiency of 82 and a transmission coefficient of 12 5 zhang et al 2019 used a star ccm software to investigate the hydrodynamic performance of the floating box and tbw wec showing that tbw wec always has higher energy capture efficiency and better wave dissipation at long period than the floating box zhang et al 2020 compared the performance of four shapes of floaters including square bottomed triangular bottomed with and without a baffle plate and the berkley wedge and found that the triangular baffle bottom floater could be an ideal coastal structure with the maximum cwr up to 93 the above studies focusing on modifying the shape of the single floating breakwater to improve the performance ning et al 2017 and zhao and ning 2018 compared the hydrodynamic performance of one pontoon and two pontoon breakwater type wec and found that the cwr of a two breakwater system is greater than that of one breakwater system they zhao et al 2019a performed an experiment study on an integrated breakwater wec system which is composed of a heaving oscillating buoy wec attached at the weather side of a fixed breakwater their study proved that the existence of the breakwater significantly improved the performance of the wec and concluded that the draft of the wec and breakwater wec spacing closely affect the heave motion of the wec zhang et al 2020b studied the costal reflection on the performance of a floating breakwater wec system and confirmed that the coastal wall led to significant increment of the efficiency of the system and the cwr could approach 100 in some special cases reabroy et al 2019 investigated an asymmetric floating wec device called by dolphin integrated with a fixed circular breakwater by comparing with different other shapes the authors found that the rao value of the dolphin wec was the best then they analyzed the influence of wave periods on wec motion and power efficiency and concluded that the highest rao value occurred at the natural wave frequency and the cwr could reach to 0 603 zhang et al 2020a concluded that a dual floating breakwater wec hybrid system has better wave attenuation and wave energy extraction capabilities at low wave frequencies and the wec can reduce the wave force on the breakwater researchers zhao et al 2021 tay 2020 also studies the performance of a wec attached to a floating breakwater whose power take off system was installed at the hinge connector that joins the wecs and the fb they found that this system which utilizes the motion energy of the floating breakwater exhibited a qualified wave power extraction performance and wave attenuation performance and had the advantages of less expensive installation and smoother power generation therefore an asymmetric geometry shape of the device or an extra breakwater at the rear side to increase wave reflection or floater motion is necessary to obtain a good hydrodynamic performance although the above studies showed that the slenderness and smoothness of a floating wec are good for the hydrodynamic performance for example the tbw but its height is too large and the curved geometry of the bottom is too complex and therefore it may be difficult and complicated to manufacture and install these structures with a specific asymmetric geometry in practical engineering the dual floating breakwater wec hybrid system may satisfy the industrial construction process and maintain the perfect hydrodynamic performance such as the dolphin model proposed by reabroy et al 2019 yet it needs to combine with an extra breakwater to realize the double functions and thus the double mooring systems may increase the construction cost this pattern is more suitable to construct in front of an existing breakwater in terms of the cost sharing view in coastal protection engineering a curtain wall type breakwater which is composed of a partially immersed vertical plate extending from above the seawater to a depth below the water surface is found to be capable of reflecting the short period waves effectively when its immersion depth is of the order of one half of the water depth to further reduce the height of transmitted wave double and multiple curtain walls breakwater has been proposed and studied liu and li 2011 ji and suh 2010 as for a floating curtain wall the hydrodynamic properties of a floating breakwater with a vertical wave wall attached to its front face restrained by vertical piles williams and mcdougal 2002 are investigated theoretically indicating that acceptable wave reflection may be obtained by varying the parameters of the breakwater wave wall system neelamani and ljubic 2018 experimentally studied the hydrodynamic performance of a floating breakwater with skirt walls showing that adding skirt walls could reduce wave transmission which consequently increased the mooring forces by 10 30 deng et al 2019 used a semi analytical method to investigate the effects of the height and position of the vertical plate on the reflection and transmission coefficient and found that it could enhance the added mass for both surge and pitch modes and it achieved the maximum when installed at the ends of the upper box the goal of this breakwater wave wall system is to reflect and dissipate waves thus to achieve wave height reduction in the lee side of the breakwater when the breakwater combined with a wave energy conversion function the wave energy needs to be captured as more as possible rather than reflecting or dissipating to get a high cwr thus the above proposed breakwaters with curtain walls or skirt walls are not suitable for the integrated breakwater wec system to consider the construction convenience and energy capture efficiency inspired by the curtain wall type breakwater we proposed a reversed l type breakwater wec structure which is a floating rectangular breakwater with a curtain wall attached to its rear face the structure is restrained by vertical piles and can respond only in heave direction we remove the curtain wall on the front face and attach it at the rear side to reduce the outward wave reflection thus the incident wave can propagate under the rectangular pontoon the wave propagates under the rectangular pontoon is partially reflected by the rear curtain wall and transports back the superposition of reflected wave with the incident wave under the rectangular pontoon yields larger waves and increases the heave motion of the floater the kinetic energy of heave motion is converted into electrical energy by a power take off pto system by increasing the kinetic energy of heave motion of the system the energy capture ratio is enhanced consequently compared with the above smoothness of a floating breakwater wec system this combined system may be less efficient in the wave energy capture because the straight corners of the rectangular pontoon and vertical plate may lead to strong eddy making wave energy dissipated and reducing heave motion on the other hand this geometry type consists of a box and a vertical plate and the two parts can be prefabricated and installed separately and therefore it will simplify the manufacture construction process and thus save installation cost the objectives of this study are to investigate the hydrodynamic and power capture performances of this modified breakwater wec integrated structure based on cfd model the equation of motion and energy conversion theory the hydrodynamic properties are presented in this paper the numerical calculations are conducted to illustrate the effects of the various structure parameters such as wave frequency pto damping force height of the curtain wall and draft of the breakwater on the efficiency of the integrated system as a breakwater and wec the efficiency of the integrated system is expressed in terms of the wave attenuation and energy capture efficiency moreover the hydrodynamic loads are of engineering concern for safe and reliable structures thus the surge restraining force and pitch restraining torque on the mounting structures are evaluated in the meantime to provide the foundation for optimal control problem this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the methodologies of the fluid flow equations heave motion equation of the floating body numerical solutions and energy conversion theories section 3 carries out the model validation tests and presents geometric parameters and the cfd calculation conditions based on the numerical calculations the hydrodynamic performance and structural loads influenced by the pto damping force wave frequency the height of the vertical curtain wall and the draft of the rectangular pontoon are analyzed in section 4 conclusions are given in section 5 2 numerical model description 2 1 fluid flow equations a two dimensional incompressible viscous flow is considered to simulate the fluid motion which is governed by the following continuity equation and n s equations 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i 2 μ ρ s i j x j f i where cartesian tensor notation is used x i i 1 2 is the coordinate of a cartesian coordinate system s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i u i i 1 2 means the component of velocity on the axis x i p is pressure ρ and μ are density and viscosity and f i means the body force such as gravity the water air flow involving wave structure interaction is treated as a multi phase flow problem that includes water air and solid body a volume function ϕ m m 1 2 3 denote water air and solid respectively is used to represent and capture the interface satisfying the conditions of 0 ϕ m 1 and ϕ 1 ϕ 2 ϕ 3 1 0 the function is determined by the solution of the following equation of ϕ m 3 φ m t u φ m 0 to ensure the stability at the interface the physical property of the solid is set as the same as the fluid thus the total volume function for the water and solid or air and solid is solved by the following equation 4 φ i 3 t u φ i 3 0 i 1 2 the solid phase ϕ 3 is determined by a lagrangian method in which a fixed rigid body is assumed after each phase is solved the physical property λ such as the density or the viscosity can be averaged for each cell as following hu and kashiwagi 2009 5 λ m 1 3 λ m ϕ m 2 2 floating body motion equation in this study the floating body is treated as a rigid body and restricted in the vertical direction therefore the motion is defined by a translational motion to its mass center its equation in the time domain can be established based on newton s second law of motion as follows 6 m 2 ζ y 2 f y m g f p t o where m is mass of the floater model ζ is the heaving motion in the vertical direction of the floating body f y is the vertical hydrodynamic force acting on the body and f pto is the pto damping force the equation is solved by the fourth order runge kutta method the hydrodynamic force and moment are calculated by integrating the pressure on the body surface as follows 7 f x a p δ i k n k d a f y a p δ i k n k d a m z a p δ i k n k r k d a 2 3 numerical solutions the governing equations are solved on a staggered cartesian grid system the momentum equation eq 2 is separated into three steps by applying a fractional step method including one advection step and two non advection steps the advection step is to calculate the advection term of the right side in eq 2 as following 8 u i t u j u i x j 0 a constrained interpolation profile cip method is employed to solve eq 8 which is a compact high order scheme with less numerical diffusion using two grid points information to construct a third order interpolation of the profile in a cell more details about this method can be found in yabe et al 2001 and hu and kashiwagi 2004 the free surface is captured by the tangent of hyperbola for interface capturing with slope weighting thinc sw scheme proposed by xiao et al 2011 as a kind of volume of fluid vof type method it can keep the sharpness of the interface and significantly improve the geometrical accuracy by reducing the ruffles at the interface the solid boundary is treated as an immersed boundary the wave body interaction is coupled by the fractional area volume obstacle representation favor method proposed by hirt 1993 the effect of a body motion on the flow is considered by imposing the velocity field of the solid body into the flow at the solid boundary hu and kashiwagi 2004 the following equation is introduced to update the local velocity of the fluid domain involving the solid body 9 u u b φ 3 u 1 φ 3 where u is the coupled velocity of the fluid involving the solid body u b is the local velocity of the body and u is the velocity obtained by eq 2 φ 3 is the volume of the solid phase in this model an internal wave maker is utilized to generate waves two sponge layers are arranged at the two ends of the flume to absorb the passing waves therefore the reflected waves from the structure can pass through the wave maker region without disturbing the wave generation and are finally absorbed by the sponge layers the momentum source function is derived by choi and yoon 2009 and li et al 2018 10 s g 2 β x exp β x 2 d ω sin ω t where ω is the wave angular frequency β is the parameter associated with the width of source function d is the source function amplitude which is determined from the target wave characteristics 2 4 energy conversion and wave dissipation there are four types of pto damping linear velocity square snap through and constant pto damping huang et al 2019 studied the optimal average output power of the four pto systems in three degrees of freedom their results showed that the order of the pto systems from the best to worst is snap through pto constant pto linear pto and velocity square pto also in the experiment of ning et al 2016 a coulomb damping model is used in the case of a hydraulic pto they used a current magnetic powder brake system to simulate the coulomb damping force and the results of the damping force exhibits a constant pto force approximately based on the above studied conclusions and considering the convenient parameter definition that there is only one parameter in the constant pto damping force model we chose the constant pto damping force model to simulate the pto system for wave energy extraction in the numerical model the pto damping force f pto directly applied on the floater is in a standard coulomb form where the magnitude of f pto is a constant and the direction is opposite to the floater motion the mechanical power from the wec device in the heaving direction is related to the pto damping force f pto and the velocity in heaving motion u y and is calculated as follows 11 p c 1 t 0 t f p t o u y d t where p c is the captured wave power u y is the velocity of the floater in y direction and u y ζ y and t is the wave period the capture width ratio of the integrated system is defined as the following 12 η e p c p i where p i is the incident wave power expressed as follows theoretically 13 p i 1 16 ρ g h 2 l t 1 4 π h l sinh 4 π h l where ρ is the water density g is the gravitational acceleration h is the wave height l the wave length t is the wave period h is the water depth 2 5 wave reflection and transmission coefficients the reflection coefficient c r and transmission coefficient c t are defined as the ratio of the reflected wave height and incident wave height and the ratio of the transmitted wave height and incident wave height respectively a wave separation method of the two point method of goda is used to separate the incident and reflected waves using the wave elevations of wave gauges g2 g3 the dissipation coefficient c d is defined as the percentage of the energy converted by the wec system and dissipated by the motion of the floater the relationship between these coefficients can be expressed as the following 14 c r 2 c t 2 c d 1 where c r is defined as h r h i c t is defined as h t h i and h r and h t is the reflected wave height and transmitted wave height respectively in addition the heave response amplitude operator hrao the ratio of the heave motion response and the incident wave height marked as hrao ζ h i indicates the integrated floating system response to the incident waves and influence the energy conversion the difference value δ c d η of the dissipation coefficient and capture width ratio representing the energy that transfer to the floater but not be captured by the wec is also analyzed to reveal more regularities in wave energy conversion 3 model validation and applications in this section the ability of the numerical model to simulate regular wave interaction with floating structures is validated then a series of numerical calculations are carried out to investigate the factors that influence the wave dissipation performance and wave energy conversion efficiency of the presented system of floating breakwater integrating wec in this paper aiming to provide guidance for designation of an optimal integrated system with high capture width ratio but low wave transmission at the same time furthermore the restraining forces and moments on the structure are analyzed to estimate the support system of bottom mounting by piles which usually increases with the energy conversion efficiency and thus increases the structural mass and overall cost of the system 3 1 model validation the numerical model we employed is the same with the model used in zhao and hu 2012 where the efficiency and accuracy of the model were validated in a case of regular wave interacting with a 2 d floating body in terms of wave profile floating body motion in heave and pitch therefore we concentrate on the capability of the numerical model to predict the wave force on structures the experiment carried out by rodríguez and spinneken 2016 was used in which a 2 d rectangular pontoon with a width of b 0 4h and draft of d 0 2h suspended from the top of the wave flume is fixed in the middle of wave flume with a constant water depth h 1 25m regular incident waves were generated and interacted with the box and the vertical wave excitation forces were recorded by the load cells connected to the box time histories of the vertical wave excitation force due to regular waves with different wave steepness of ak 0 10 with kd 0 4 0 7 and 1 0 are demonstrated in the reference where k is the wave number and a is the regular wave amplitude more information in detail should be referred to rodríguez and spinneken 2016 fig 1 gives the comparison of the normalized vertical wave excitation force f t ρgad between the numerical model calculation and the experimental results also results of chen et al 2020b is depicted in the figures for better comparison it is evident that there exist pronounced nonlinearities in the wave force traces for kd 1 0 overall the agreement between the numerical model calculations and the experimental results is good in particular our numerical result is slightly lower than the experimental data in the trough which is also seen in the results of chen et al 2020b with a better fitness on the other hand our result fits well with the experimental data in the peak moreover both numerical models predict the nonlinear forcing terms in a satisfied level of accuracy in this way the numerical can be used to calculate the wave forces on the structures rodríguez and spinneken 2016 also carried out experiments allowing the box to heave freely with all other degrees of freedom constrained the heave motions was recorded for the complete set of regular wave cases 0 2 kb 1 2 this hrao is shown in fig 2 where the numerical calculation results red stars line are compared against experimental data black stars line a linear potential flow prediction by wamit green solid line and a time domain td simulation incorporating an additional damping term blue solid line in considering the hrao in fig 2 the agreement between the numerical calculation results experimental data and the linear potential flow prediction is good for cases that are not in proximity of the box resonance frequency kb 0 5 and kb 0 8 however for cases in proximity of the resonance 0 5 kb 0 7 substantial motion discrepancies are observed between linear potential flow predictions and experimental data while only slight reductions are noted for the numerical calculation results the observed motion reductions imply that an additional source of damping is present in the experiments and the linear potential flow fails to predict well instead the good match of the numerical calculation results and the experimental data in proximity of the resonance in fig 2 indicates that this numerical model is indeed adequate to predict the heave motion of a wec integrated floater even in the resonance region since the reflection and transmission coefficients will also be analyzed in the following section we need to validate the capability of the model in computing the profile of the free water surface in the weather side and lee side of the floating body the experiment carried out by peng et al 2013 is used to validate this model in which a 2 d rectangular pontoon with a width of 0 40 m a height of 0 25 m and a length of 0 68 m the total mass and moment of inertia at the center of gravity are 28 6 kg and 0 435 kg m2 respectively the box is moored to the bottom with a 60 inclination by four stainless chains with a submergence depth of 10 2 cm the incident wave is regular with the period t i of 1 0 s and wave height of 4 6 cm the wave gages is located at x 195 cm 120 cm 120 cm 165 cm with the origin at the center of the box fig 3 gives the comparisons of time history of the free surface profiles between our numerical results and experimental data in peng et al 2013 as we can see that our model can calculate the free surface profiles in a satisfactory accuracy in the weather side and lee side of a moored floating body excited by regular waves the nonlinearity of the wave profiles in the lee side is simulated in agreement with the experimental data therefore our model can be used to calculate the reflection and transmission coefficients induced by a moored floater 3 2 numerical model setting and calculation conditions the basic configurations and dimensions of the integrated structure are based on the wec type floating breakwater model investigated by ning et al 2016 with a vertical protruding plate attached in the leeward side of the rectangular pontoon the structure model utilizes froude scaling criterion with the scaling factor of 1 10 compared with the full scale breakwater for better comparison we design a basic model that has the same volume of displacement with the floating breakwater of ning et al 2016 thus the width is b 0 8 m the length is b z 0 78 m the height is d 0 6 m the draft d 0 2425 m the width and height of the vertical curtain wall is b 0 05 m and d p 0 1 m the floating structure is pile restrained at the first third part of the numerical wave flume with a water depth of h 1 0 m shown in fig 4 the dimensions of the flume are 35 m in length with two wave absorbing regions located at each end of the flume to reduce the wave reflection four wave probes positioned in front and back of the floater as shown schematically in fig 4 were used to measure the surface elevation two were placed in front of the floater for separation of the incident wave height h i and reflection wave height h r and the other two in the leeward side of the floater for separation of transmission wave height h t from the waves reflected off the wave absorbing beach the distances between wave gauges are shown in fig 4 the numerical calculations are divided into three categories to investigate the factors influencing the performance of the integrated breakwater wec the wave period and pto damping force the height of the curtain wall and the draft of the floating box during the whole process the still water depth h is fixed at 1 0 m the draft d 0 2425 m except for the cases for the influence of draft targeted incident wave height h i 0 20 m the wave conditions in the numerical calculations are listed in table 1 the corresponding test cases are summarized in table 2 table 4 cases 1 10 in table 2 consider the influence of wave period and pto damping force on the performance of the integrated breakwater wec by setting t at 1 37 s 1 58 s 1 79 s and 2 0 s and f pto at 40 240 n at 20 30 n interval respectively under the three heights of vertical curtain wall d p 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 cases 11 12 in table 3 focus on the influence of the height of the vertical curtain wall on the performance of the integrated breakwater wec cases 13 22 in table 4 study the influence of the draft of the floating box on the performance of the integrated system including five drafts in the configurations of two sets of the curtain wall height and wave period respectively and six sets of pto damping force 3 3 grid convergence test grid convergence were investigated to simulate the periodic wave interacting with the heave motion model in seven grids test1 test7 as shown in table 5 the grids are ununiform in the computational domain and were fined around the structure and the free surface which is listed in table 5 as min δx and min δy the simulation conditions are chosen as case 5 and the damping force is set as f pto 150 n as shown in table 2 the comparison results of heave motion response amplitude operator vertical wave force and the surface elevation at gauges g4 are shown in fig 5 we found that coarse meshes agree with well with fine meshes with respect to heave motions and wave forces except a little difference in the peaks and toughs in wave elevations therefore the grid convergence of the model is satisfied for the sake of computational efficiency and better capture of the wave structure interaction process the finer meshes resolution of 0 4 cm in x direction and 0 1 cm in y direction are adopted in the following computations 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrodynamic performance of the integrated system in this section the results of numerical calculations are analyzed to explore the factors that influence the hydrodynamic performance of the presented floating breakwater integrating wec aiming to provide guidance for designation of an optimal integrated system with high capture width ratio but low wave transmission at the same time the main indices that are used to evaluate the performance are the reflection transmission and dissipation coefficient of the breakwater the heave response of the floater and the energy capture width ratio of the wec devices 4 1 1 influence of wave frequency and pto damping force the pto system is an essential part of a wec in which the pto damping force affects energy captured ratio and the motion of the floater which consequently influence the reflection and transmission of the incident wave studies showed that the wave attenuation performance and wave energy conversion efficiency can be achieved in a certain frequency range with the converter in resonance with waves ning et al 2016 since the resonant frequency of the wec can be adjusted to the incident wave frequency by choosing specific parameters of the pto huang et al 2019 we perform calculations to reveal the influence of the wave frequency and the pto damping force on the hydrodynamic performance of the integrated breakwater wec the influence of the pto damping force is investigated by considering f pto 40 n 80 n 100 n 120 n 150 n 180 n 200 n 220 n 240 n four sets of wave period t 1 37 s 1 58 s 1 79 s and 2 0 s are chosen to reveal the influence of the wave frequency where the correspondence of wave conditions is listed in table 1 the wave height is 0 2 m the draft of the floating box is 0 2425 m and the height of the vertical curtain wall is discussed with three sets of 0 1 m 0 2 m and 0 3 m to ensure the conclusion of generality the curves of the reflection coefficient c r transmission coefficient c t dissipation coefficient c d capture width ratio η e difference value δ c d η e and the heave response amplitude operator hrao as the function of time averaged pto damping force f pto for the configurations shown in table 2 under each tested wave condition in table 1 are illustrated in figs 6 8 it can be seen that c r shows an increasing tendency in almost all waves while it decreases first and then increases with the increase of f pto in the case of kh 1 72 however c t exhibits an opposite trend compared to c r the condition of c t 0 5 can be satisfied for shorter waves of kh 1 42 and for longer waves of kh 1 42 with a larger f pto setting the variation of the cwr η e shows a parabolic trend and the maximum of the η e can be found clearly throughout the range of pto damping force as the wave frequency kh decreases the pto damping force f pto at the peak value of η e increases generally for all the three configurations of the height of the vertical curtain wall d p except for the case of kh 1 72 which may be because this wave frequency is close to the natural frequency of the structure in all the three configurations of d p for the cases of kh 2 20 and 1 72 the transmission coefficient is lower than 0 4 and the peak value of η e 30 can be achieved at the meantime which is similar to the conclusion of ning et al 2016 but has relatively better hydrodynamic performance what is noteworthy is that for the cases of kh 2 20 and 1 72 the transmission coefficient c t is rather stable in the range of 0 2 or 0 35 with varying f pto while the corresponding η e varied significantly with a peak value with an appropriate f pto setting on the other hand for the cases of kh 1 42 and 1 21 the condition of c t 0 5 and η e 30 can be satisfied with the proper pto setting this indicates that this breakwater wec system is more effective for the shorter waves moreover from the variations of η e with wave frequency kh we can see that the peak values of η e were achieved with larger f pto setting as kh decreases this is due to the fact that the wave with lower wave frequency kh carries more wave energy and induces more intense heave motion which can be found in the tendency of hrao thus the optimal f pto needs to be larger to capture as more wave energy as possible for lower frequency waves the dissipation coefficient c d shows an opposite tendency of c r a general decreasing trend with the f pto increasing it is worth noting that for all the three d p configurations the c d in the case of kh 1 72 is larger than that of the other wave frequency cases with the same d p setting which is similar with the trend of η e this may be induced by the resonance of waves and the integrated system although the system in the case of kh 1 72 achieves the maximum η e of all the wave frequency cases the heave motion response hrao in this case nonetheless does not reach the largest motion which is different from our general knowledge of the resonance since c d is defined as the percentage of the energy converted by the wec system and dissipated by the motion of the floater and the converted energy also comes from the potential kinetic energy of heave motion of the floater therefore from the tendency of η e we can conclude that the resonance energy has been transferred by the wec system leading to the fact that the hrao increases regularly with the wave frequency decreasing hence we can conclude that the energy converted by the wec system plays a more important role in the energy dissipation of the breakwater wec the coefficient δ c d η e represents the energy dissipated by the motion of the floater which includes the kinetic energy of the floater represented by hrao and the external damping energy caused by viscous damping and friction loss the variation of δ shows a fast decreasing tendency with the increase of f pto firstly and a small rising trend at the high f pto setting lastly opposite to the trend of η e with a larger transition point of f pto as the hrao shows a constant decreasing trend it can be concluded that the external damping increases with the increasing f pto at the high f pto range moreover the trend of the variations of δ with the wave frequency are similar to that of the c d different from that of hrao implying that the external damping is also significant at the resonance specially from the comparisons of the trend of variations of η e and c t with the f pto we can find that the f pto setting reaching the minimum of c t is larger than that achieving the maximum of η e although the two f pto settings are large for example for the case of kh 1 72 and d p 0 1 m the f pto with minimum of c t is 220n while the f pto with maximum of η e is 150n the variations of c t in the range of f pto 150 220n is small from 0 36 to 0 31 on the contrary the η e varies significantly from 40 to 24 this means that the two functions of wave energy utilization and wave energy attenuation cannot achieve their optimal performance simultaneously but as a compromise there may exist a configuration for which the cwr and transmission coefficient of the integration breakwater wec meet a satisfied level by comparing the three heights d p of the curtain wall it is seen straightforwardly that a better performance of η e and c t are obtained for a higher curtain wall which will be discussed more in the following section the pto damping force f pto achieving the maximum of η e increases with the increase of d p and the influence is more intense for smaller wave frequency kh specifically the maximum of η e for the case of kh 2 20 does not have an obvious increase with the increase of d p from d p 0 1 to d p 0 2 while the maximum of η e for the case of kh 1 72 increases from η e max 0 40 to η e max 0 48 with the increase of d p from d p 0 1 to d p 0 2 and that for the case of kh 1 42 increases from η e max 0 42 to η e max 0 49 with the increase of d p from d p 0 2 to d p 0 3 moreover the hydrodynamic performance is more stable with variations of f pto for the configuration of higher value of d p and it maintains a high level of η e 35 and c t 0 5 over a range of f pto particularly for a higher curtain wall d p 0 3 the η e of three wave frequency cases achieves almost the same level indicating that the wave frequency has little influence on the energy capture ratio width η e therefore from this point of the view the configurations of higher curtain wall d p 0 3 are more flexible and adaptive to the complex ocean environment since the actual waves are random and the wave frequency varies in a range 4 1 2 influence of the height of the vertical curtain wall to further illustrate the relationship of the hydrodynamic performance of the integrated breakwater wec system and the height of the curtain wall we performed the calculations of cases 11 and 12 in table 3 to consider the height of the curtain wall d p 0 0 0 6 m d p d 0 2 5 with the results shown in fig 9 it can be seen that as intuitively expected the curtain wall has a considerable influence on wave transmission and energy capture as the height of the curtain wall is increased the transmission coefficient c t drops dramatically and the wave energy cwr η e goes up significantly for example in the case of f pto 150 n increasing the curtain wall from d p d 0 4 to d p d 2 0 decreases the transmission coefficient c t from 0 36 to 0 08 and increases the cwr η e by twice and more specifically the runup trend of the cwr η e keeps up till some height of the curtain wall and then turns into a slow growth for the case of f pto 150 n the transition height is d p d 1 24 and for the case of f pto 200 n the transition height is d p d 2 0 this indicates that the enhancement effect on the hydrodynamic performance brought by the height of the curtain wall has a limit and the enhancement is more significant for a larger pto damping force it is understood that the waves are surface waves whose energy is concentrated in a limited depth under the water surface and the influence diameter of the wave motion decreases in a deeper water region comparing the cases of f pto 150 n and f pto 200 n we can find that the hydrodynamic performance for case f pto 150 n in terms of c r c t c d and η e is better than that of case f pto 200 n in the low height curtain wall range d p d 1 6 while in the high height curtain wall range d p d 1 6 an inverse trend is observed that the coefficients of c t and η e for case f pto 200 n are larger this indicates that although a higher curtain wall may enhance the performance of wave energy capture it needs a larger pto damping force to match up which may increase the force acting on the support structure and thus add construction cost 4 1 3 influence of the draft of the floating breakwater to illustrate the influence of the draft of the floating box on the hydrodynamic performance of the integrated breakwater wec four drafts are investigated for two sets of wave frequency and curtain wall height see cases 13 22 in table 4 the values of the draft of the floating box with a vertical curtain wall in this study are determined to have the same displacement with the floating breakwater wec d h 0 20 0 25 0 27 and 0 30 studied by ning et al 2016 it should be noted that as the draft of the floating box changes the mass of the floater increases to make sure that it is a free floating breakwater in still water the rest of the parameters maintains the same with the initial tests the variations of reflection coefficients c r transmission coefficient c t dissipation coefficient c d capture width ratio η e difference value δ c d η e and the heave response amplitude operator hrao as the function of time averaged pto damping force f pto are shown in fig 10 fig 12 it can be seen that the variations of c r c t η e and hrao with the draft d are all similar for different cases which means that changing the draft in a small range does not significantly modify the variation trend of these parameters as the function of f pto specifically the larger draft d leads to a larger reflection coefficient and smaller transmission coefficient because the blockage effect of the front wall of the floating breakwater is more evident as the draft increases as has also been observed by ning et al 2016 this can also be explained by the trend of hrao that the heave response hrao decreases with the increasing of the draft d as it becomes heavier and hence less energy pass through the floating breakwater and more energy are reflected back the hrao of the wec devices are also discussed by zhao et al 2019a that it increases with the increasing draft in which the cylindrical wec devices are equally spaced on the weather side of the breakwater the two distinctly different trends may result from the different geometries and layouts revealing that it needs to be investigated for each specific geometry although the difference value δ shows no same trend with the draft for different cases the capture width ratio η e decreases as the draft increases for all three cases because the converted energy mainly comes from the kinetic energy of the floater this trend means that although the floater gets heavier as the draft increases the heave response hrao decreases greatly and offset the bonus of the increased mass of the floater on the kinetic energy indicating that the hrao of the floater plays a significant role in the wave energy capture process rather than the draft as for the trend of the variations of these coefficients with f pto for different drafts for two sets of curtain wall height with the same wave frequency kh 2 2 see figs 10 and 11 we can conclude that the variations of these coefficients of c r c t c d η e δ and hrao with f pto for d p 0 1 m is similar to that of the case of d p 0 2 m for two sets of wave frequency with the same curtain wall height see figs 11 and 12 we can observe that the trends of the c d coefficient for the case of kh 1 72 differ from that of the case of kh 2 2 characterized as increasing firstly and then decreasing which causes the small difference of η e with the drafts at small pto damping force range yet these differences are not such great that the capture width ratio η e exhibits similar tendency for the three sets where an optimal f pto can be identified moreover the optimal f pto of different drafts behaves differently with the variation of wave frequency at the wave frequency kh 2 2 a larger draft needs a smaller optimal f pto to achieve a maximum η e whereas the optimal f pto dose not alter with the drafts at the wave frequency kh 1 72 4 1 4 sensitivity analysis of the hydrodynamic performance in order to compare the influence effect of the pto damping force f pto draft d and curtain wall height d p on the hydrodynamic performance of the integrated device the sensitivity analysis of the hydrodynamic performance of c t and η e with respect to the f pto d and d p has been carried out for fair comparison the cases in section 4 1 3 are considered in this section the sensitivity coefficient is defined as 15 k c t δ c t c t i δ x i x i 16 k η e δ η e η e i δ x i x i where the δc t and δη e is calculated as the difference between the best performance and worst performance of the cases in one set therefore the sensitivity coefficients of d and f pto are analyzed under different configurations of pto damping force and draft separately for example the sensitivity coefficients of d are analyzed under different conditions f pto 80 100 120 150 180 n in the three configurations which are drawn as the columns filled in with pure colors in fig 13 and similarly the sensitivity coefficients of f pto are analyzed under different conditions d 0 20 0 25 0 27 0 30 m the draft of the box that has the same displacement with the floater attached the curtain wall in the three configurations which are drawn as the columns filled in with pure colors and oblique lines in fig 13 the sensitivity coefficients of d p are analyzed under different configurations of drafts d at a fixed pto damping force f pto 150 n which appropriately have a relatively good performance in c t and η e from fig 13 we can see that the sensitivity coefficients of d are the largest among the three factors meaning that the draft d has the most significant influence on the hydrodynamic performance of c t and η e specifically the dramatic difference is more noticeable in the performance of c t and it does not alter a lot as the change of curtain wall height d p which coincides with our cognition that the draft of the floating breakwater has a great influence on the wave dissipation while for the performance of η e the dramatic difference alters with the wave frequency kh and curtain wall height d p particularly the difference between d and f pto is almost negligible in the configuration of kh 1 72 d p 0 2 m it implies that the influence of draft on the performance of η e is less significant for a longer wave and the optimal energy capture width ratio can be tuned by the other factors the sensitivity coefficients of f pto show an opposite trend to that of d that the influence of f pto on the performance of η e is more significant than that of c t this may be relative to the fact that the damping force is directly related to the energy capture efficiency in detail the sensitivity coefficients of f pto on η e decrease with the increase of d p and decrease of kh while they increase with the increase of d p on c t and have no much variations with the change of kh this is beneficial for tuning the optimal performance of the integrated device because the f pto does not alter the transmission coefficient a lot and thus the influence factors may be decoupled to some extent the sensitivity coefficients of d p on the performance of η e and c t are much smaller than that of d barely accounting for a half of the level of d this is because that the two drafts of d p and d have different widths leading to different displacements which affects the device motion in different degrees and thus affects the performance of η e and c t differently consequently although the sensitivity coefficients of d p is not as large as that of d from the view of engineering economy the curtain wall height d p may still have its competitive edge in the ways of the effect on the performance of η e and c t it behaves in a similar way to that of d p the way that the c t is more sensitive than η e to the factors of the two drafts of d p and d 4 2 restraining forces and moments on the mounting structure for this kind of pile restrained floating structures a mounting structure should be designed to support the floater as shown in fig 4 because the floater is restricted to motion in heave direction the mounting structure must handle the reaction force and moment in surge and pitch direction induced by hydrodynamic and hydrostatic forces to achieve zero surge and pitch at all time thus a force and moment analysis are conducted to obtain an estimation of the force and moment acting on the floater in surge and pitch direction they can be represented by an equivalent force and moment at the centroid of the floating breakwater which are normalized by the formula of f x f x ρ g h b b z f y f y ρ g h b b z and m z m z ρ g h b 2 b z ρ is the water density h is the wave height and b and b z is the width of the floater in x and z direction respectively here f x f y and m z denotes the significant value f 1 3 of the calculated maximums of wave force or moment acting on the floater for a wave condition occurred in the time histories where the gravity of the floater is subtracted from f y the value f 1 3 can be given as f 1 3 1 n 3 i 1 n 3 f i where n is the total number of the wave actions f i is the sorted largest amplitude of wave force or moment moreover to provide more information for the design and fatigue evaluation of the structural strength the wave pressure at different positions of the floating breakwater is calculated and analyzed six pressure points are chosen to measure the wave pressure p on the surface of the floating body the detailed locations of the pressure points are shown in fig 14 the pressure is also normalized by the similar method of f x f y and m z with the formula of p p ρ g h fig 15 show the time series of the non dimensional wave pressure p at positions 1 6 located on the seaward surface bottom and curtain wall of the floater for the case of kh 1 72 d p 0 2m d 0 235m with f pto 60n and 150n we chose this case because that η e gets the smallest and largest value at the pto damping force for this case as shown in fig 12 and it is meaningful to understand the variation of the pressure on the floater with the variation of f pto we can see that pto damping force has a moderate effect on the pressure of positions 1 3 and has little effect on the pressure of positions 4 6 in detail the pressure decreases with the increase of pto damping force on the seaward surface of the floater and increases with the increase of pto damping force on the backward bottom of the floater represented by 5 this is probably related with the standing wave in front of the floater which may increase with the increase of the reflection coefficient as the pto damping force increases this tendency varies with kh and is discussed more detailly in zhao et al 2017 the slight increase of the pressure on position 5 with the increase of pto damping force may be due to the decrease of the transmission coefficient and the superposition of incident and reflected waves by the curtain wall we will discuss if this trend fits all the cases on some positions in the following sections another fact that should be noted is that the pressure time series at all six points are periodic but they are not simple harmonic periodic the shapes of pressure at positions 1 3 have a flat wave trough and steep wave crest as a stokes wave which is related with the superposition of incident and reflected waves in front of the floater while the shapes of pressure at positions 4 6 have a second order harmonic wave this may be attributed to the vortices around the corner induced by the vertical curtain wall which may dominate the flow field 4 2 1 influence of wave frequency and pto damping force the results of the wave exciting heave force the restraining surge force and pitching moment and the pressure on the floater as a function of time averaged pto damping force f pto for the wave conditions shown in table 2 are illustrated in figs 16 18 we note that the exciting heave force f y and restraining pitching moment m z are affected significantly by the pto damping force f pto while the restraining surge force f x does not change with the f pto in most wave frequencies f y shows a tendency of decreasing firstly and then increasing for most cases implying that a large motion with small restriction in heave causes a larger wave force in heave than that with a properly restricted motion which is interestingly the reverse tendency of η e in figs 6 8 this coincidence indicates that the η e may have a close connection with the wave exciting heave force f y on the floater and gets the maximum when f y reaches the bottom this gives us a good expectation that the minimum wave exciting heave force and maximum wave energy capture ratio can be achieved simultaneously which is beneficial to the structure safety and facility function realization if the f pto is adjusted properly m z shows a decreasing tendency as the f pto increases which is the joint effect of the f x and f y in all the three configurations of d p the restraining wave forces of the cases of kh 1 42 and 1 72 are larger than the other cases especially for the case of kh 1 72 d p 0 3 m in this case the f x increases dramatically with the increase of f pto among all the wave frequencies the case of kh 1 72 has the maximum f y and f x but a relatively small m z this may be related with the resonance of the floater with the incident wave as we concluded from the figures in figs 6 8 that the case of kh 1 72 gets the maximum η e this means that we need to pay an extra greater structural load for maximizing power absorption as discussed in detail by tom et al 2019 we give the nondimensional wave pressure amplitude at the points 4 6 on the bottom of the floating box and the seaward surface of the curtain wall as can be seen from figs 16 18 the pto damping force affects the wave pressure in different ways in particular at the position 4 close to the front the variation of the wave pressure at point 4 as a function of f pto shows a trend of a decrease first and a following increase for the most wave conditions except for the case of kh 1 72 d p 0 1 m and kh 1 42 d p 0 2 m this point 4 has an approximate position with point 3 in zhao et al 2017 where the pressure shows a slight increasing tendency with the f pto increasing this difference mainly derives from the added curtain wall in the leeward side of the floating box which causes a reflection wave in front of the curtain wall and may form a standing wave with the superposition of an incident wave at point 6 the same trend occurs but a smaller value this may possibly be attributed to the vortices stronger near the position around the corner which may have significant contribution to the flow field at point 5 on the latter section of the bottom the wave pressure increases slightly with the increase of f pto implying that the more restriction the pto imposes on the floater the higher pressure point 5 bears among the three pressure points wave pressure on point 4 is twice as the other points indicating that we should pay special attention to this section and check its safety in design 4 2 2 influence of the height of the vertical curtain wall fig 19 depicts the influence of the height of the curtain wall d p on wave forces wave moment and wave pressure of the floater as we can see that the wave force and moment f y f x m z show an increasing tendency as the dimensionless height of the vertical curtain wall d p d increases for both selected f pto however the pressures p on the floating breakwater do not show an identity of tendencies since the pressure at point 4 is relatively unaffected by d p d while the pressure at point 6 has a more evident increasing trend with the increase of d p d checking their positions we can figure out that the point 4 is in the front zone of the floater bottom which is farther away from the curtain wall while the point 6 is on the curtain wall a place where the pressure is directly influenced by the interference effect on wave transmission of the curtain wall this gives us a conclude that a high curtain wall would deduce a high pressure on the curtain wall and that will increase the fracture risk of the curtain wall particularly we find that the f y f x m z and p for f pto 150 n has a transition that the increasing trend becomes decreasing as the d p d increases at the value of d p d 2 0 which coincides with the tendency of η e in section 4 1 2 this confirms our conjecture in section 4 1 2 that the increase of the height of the curtain wall has a limit influence on the hydrodynamic performance in terms of energy capture ration and wave force by comparing the results of f pto 150 n and f pto 200 n we can find that the influence of pto is not so significant as we expected in section 4 1 2 for the wave forces of f y the result of larger pto damping force of f pto 200 n is greater firstly and then smaller than that of the smaller pto damping force of f pto 150 n and a reverse trend exists in the f x whereas for the wave moment of m z the result of f pto 200 n is a little smaller than that of f pto 150 n except for d p d 2 5 nevertheless as our attention is on the restraining force on the mounting structure the f x m z are the most concern the wave fore f x for the large pto of f pto 200 n is slightly larger than that of f pto 150 n in the higher height curtain wall range d p d 0 8 coinciding with the conjecture in section 4 1 2 that a lager pto damping force may increase the force acting on the mounting structure as regards the wave moment in pitch m z that does not conform to the trend we consider that might be because that the point of the wave moment m z in our calculation is located at the centroid of the floating box which keeps moving with the motion of the floating box and so that it may not reflect the wave moment acting on the mounting structure completely 4 2 3 influence of the draft of the floating breakwater figs 20 22 show the influence of the draft of the floater on wave forces wave moment and wave pressure of the integrated breakwater wec as we can see in the three configurations the draft of the floater has significant effect on the wave force in x direction while not much influences are found in the wave force in y direction and wave moment more specifically the wave force f x with the larger draft have a larger value indicating that wave force in x direction increases with the increase of the draft on the other hand the wave moment m z with the smaller height of curtain wall does not clearly get affected by the draft yet as the height of the vertical curtain wall d p increases d p 0 2 the influence becomes evident that the largest draft has the smallest wave moment which is opposite to the trend of the wave force in x direction the wave force in y direction with the largest draft is the largest of all drafts at kh 1 72 d p 0 2 m which may be caused by the resonance corresponding to the behavior of wave forces the pressures at positions 2 are affected much significantly by the draft in a similar way to the wave force f x while the pressures at position 5 and 6 are less influenced by the draft as similar to that of the wave force f y however the pressures with larger draft are not always the largest as shown in figs 20 and 21 the trend is converse that the pressures increase with the increase of the draft in fig 22 which is a low wave frequency with a higher curtain wall as for the role of wave frequency and height of the vertical curtain wall the height of the vertical curtain wall has little influence on the pressure at positions 2 and 5 moderate influence on the pressure at position 6 as shown in figs 20 and 21 whereas the wave frequency kh plays an important role in pressures especially at point 2 as shown in figs 21 and 22 interestingly the variation of pressure at position 6 as a function of pto damping force has changed into a decreasing trend from an increasing trend as the wave frequency kh decreases from 2 2 to 1 72 this may be contributed by the resonant phenomenon of the incident wave and the floater 4 2 4 sensitivity analysis of the restraining force and moment as illustrated in section 4 1 4 the influence sensitivity analyses of the pto damping force f pto draft d and curtain wall height d p on the restraining force f x and moment m z of the integrated device are carried out in a similar way to section 4 1 4 and the results are shown in fig 23 as seen in fig 23 in the aspect of restraining force f x the sensitivity coefficients of d are the largest of the three factors meaning that the draft d has the most significant influence on f x which is like the trend of the hydrodynamic performance on the contrary in the aspect of restraining moment m z the sensitivity coefficients of d p are the largest of the three factors different from the trend of the hydrodynamic performance this is because that the curtain wall enhances the arm of force and thus increases the wave moment on the device as expected the sensitivity coefficients of pto damping force on restraining force f x are the smallest since the pto damping force is acted in the y direction also that of the height of the curtain wall are small because the wave energy is mainly concentrated on the surface and the water particle velocities are small in the zone of the curtain wall on the other hand the sensitivity coefficients of the draft d on restraining force f x increase with the decrease of the wave frequency because a longer wave has more wave energy and thus larger wave force on the device implying that the wave frequency has evident influence on the restraining force f x and that on restraining moment m z decreases with the increase of the height of curtain wall this means that although the restraining moment m z is sensitive to the height of curtain wall in a large extent the effect is reduced as the increase of the height of curtain wall this is conducive to the design of a higher curtain wall since it can enhance the hydrodynamic performance of the device 4 3 fluid domain and vortex in order to investigate the wave dissipation and wave reflection characteristics during the incident wave interaction with the floating breakwater wec structure the fluid field domain and vortex evolution is discussed in this section according to the above discussion it is found that the floating breakwater wec system gets relatively good performance in the configuration of kh 1 72 d p 0 3 m f pto 150 n in case 8 so that we choose this case to illustrate the flow characteristics besides to elaborate the benefit of this modified geometry comparing with the original geometries we calculated the cases of the rectangular pontoon geometry and the traditional curtain wall breakwater with a front curtain wall attached to the rectangular pontoon for a thorough understanding the calculated hydrodynamic performance coefficients for these three geometries are listed in table 6 we can see that the front curtain wall geometry has the largest reflection coefficient and smallest transmission coefficient of the three implying that this traditional curtain wall breakwater has best performance as a breakwater however as we predicted in the introduction its wave energy capture ratio is so small that the wave energy conversion function could almost be neglectable therefore this geometry is not suitable for the integration of the breakwater and energy capture the modified geometry rear curtain wall shifting curtain wall at the rear side of the box exhibits an optimal hydrodynamic performance with a largest energy capture ratio and smallest transmission coefficient compared to the rectangular geometry the rear curtain wall geometry enhances the energy capture ratio by 65 and reduces the transmission coefficient by 36 implying that the modified geometry could enhance the hydrodynamic performance and is a preferable choice for the breakwater integrated with wave energy capture function based on the velocity fields of the above cfd simulations the vorticity is obtained by calculating the curl of the velocity field as the following 17 ω u j x i u i x j according to the definition the negative vorticity has the clockwise circulation and the positive has the anticlockwise circulation the vorticity velocity and pressure field at four different moments of an entire period is shown in fig 24 and fig 25 it is observed that the vortices generate and move away at the corners of the structure when the floater is moving upward from a normal position a strong anticlockwise vortex is generated at the left corner of the rectangular pontoon and a small clockwise vortex is generated at the right corner of the vertical curtain wall see fig 24 a the vortices are the origins of the drag force of the motion and dissipate the wave energy at the same time a low pressure area is observed at the core of the two vortices see fig 25 a which is the source of the downstream convection of the eddy as the floater moves upward the larger anticlockwise eddy is convected downstream under the bottom of the rectangular pontoon and the smaller clockwise eddy gets rising at the rear side of the vertical curtain wall see fig 24 b from fig 25 b it is seen that the fluid under the bottom of the rectangular pontoon is separated into two parts one part is reflected backward as like a reflected wave the other part moves downward and passes across the edge of the curtain wall as like a transmitted wave this process explains why the transmission coefficient of this geometry is smaller than that of the rectangular floating breakwater similarly when the floater is moving downward from a normal position a strong clockwise vortex is generated at the left corner of the rectangular pontoon and a small anticlockwise vortex is generated at the right corner of the vertical curtain wall due to the flow separation see fig 24 c at the same time a negative pressure area is observed at the core of the two vortices see fig 25 c which leads the eddy to convect upward along the front of the floating box see figs 24 d and fig 25 d at this stage the backward flow of the fluid under the bottom of the floating box is more significant see fig 25 c which is the result of the reflection of the vertical curtain wall and the wave downward motion this process is so strong that it causes a plunging backward wave breaking process in front of the floater which dissipates the wave energy see fig 24 d fig 26 and fig 27 show the vorticity velocity and pressure fields around the front curtain wall geometry in the same configuration of f pto 150 n d p 0 3 m in case 8 under the wave frequency of kh 1 72 it can be seen that two vortices occur around the curtain wall one large clockwise vortex in front of the curtain wall and one small anticlockwise at the tip of the thin curtain wall as shown in fig 26 b and c also a low pressure zone appears at the tip of the thin curtain wall as shown in fig 27 b and c driven by the pressure difference as the floater moves downward the anticlockwise vortex is extruded out and merges with the clockwise vortex in front of the curtain wall fig 26 d rolling up to the water surface fig 26 a comparing figs 24 25 and figs 26 27 we can see that most flow separations happen in front of the curtain wall where the velocities of u and v are much larger than that of other zones thus there are no vortices at the bottom of the rectangular pontoon and only a negligible vortex at the rear corner of the rectangular pontoon in addition the water elevation in front of the floater in fig 26 a is much higher than that in fig 24 a implying that the reflection of the front curtain wall geometry is larger than that of the rear curtain wall geometry this explains why the transmission coefficient of this geometry is little at the meantime the v velocity at the bottom of the rectangular pontoon is nearly zero different from that in figs 24 and 25 that the velocity at the bottom of the rectangular pontoon is relative larger and even comparable to the velocity in front of the floater consequently the motion of device the is weak leading to a small wave energy capture ratio fig 28 and fig 29 show the vorticity velocity and pressure fields around the rectangular pontoon without a curtain wall in the same configuration of f pto 150 n in case 8 under the wave frequency of kh 1 72 as we can see the heave motion of this rectangular geometry is smaller than that of the rear curtain wall geometry but larger than that of the of the front curtain wall geometry fig 28 b and d this may be explained by the flow velocity fields under the bottom of the rectangular pontoon as expected the u velocity of the rectangular geometry is much larger than that of the rear curtain wall geometry and no reflection exists while the opposite trend is observed in the v velocity consequently less wave energy is converted into the heave motion of the floater and more wave energy is transmitted behind the floater hence the transmission coefficient is larger than that of the rear curtain wall geometry additionally the vortices and pressure of this rectangular geometry have almost the same pattern with that of the rear curtain wall geometry with a slightly stronger vortex at the rear side corner of the floaters consequently more energy is dissipated and less energy is captured by the pto system leading to a less energy capture width ratio compared to the rear curtain wall geometry 5 conclusions and remarks the hydrodynamic properties of an integrated system combining an asymmetric floating breakwater and a wave energy converter have been investigated numerically the asymmetric floating breakwater is a floating pontoon with a vertical curtain wall attached in the leeward side of the floating pontoon the structure is partially restrained by vertical piles and can respond only in heave a numerical model based on n s equations was employed and developed to simulate the hydrodynamic performance of the wec type floating breakwater in regular waves the pto damping force characteristics were specially investigated in this paper fluid domain and vortices are analyzed and compared among three geometries of the floaters to give a thorough understanding the sensitivity analysis of the influence factors has been done results have been presented that illustrate the effect of the incident wave frequency draft of the pontoon height of the vertical curtain wall and the pto damping force on the performance of the wec type floating breakwater the following conclusions can be drawn from this study 1 the pto damping force have a significant effect on the reflection transmission and dissipation coefficients and the cwr of the integrated system the lowest transmission coefficient and largest cwr cannot be achieved simultaneously at the same pto damping force thus there may exist a value of the pto damping force to get the system an optimum performance the wave exciting heave force reaches its trough at the optimal pto damping force with a maximum cwr the wave forces get the maximum at the resonance frequency of the floater with the incident wave pressure on the front of the bottom of the floater is larger than that on the back and the curtain wall wave pressure at the front of the bottom and on the curtain wall as a function of f pto shows a trend of a decrease first and a following increase for most cases 2 a higher curtain wall keeps the hydrodynamic performance more stable with the variations of pto damping force and wave frequency the performance of the system gets enhanced with a higher curtain wall but the increase rate decreases as the increase of the height of the curtain wall and a higher curtain wall needs a larger pto damping force to match up meanwhile the wave forces and wave moment acting on the floater maintain a constant increase rate and have a transition at a relatively large height of the curtain wall this implies that the performance enhancement will cause greater structure loads but the influence has a limit the pto damping force has little influence on wave forces and moment 3 the larger draft d leads to a larger reflection coefficient smaller transmission coefficient and heave motion but a smaller cwr in other words increasing the draft is not definitely a better choice for the comprehensive performance of the system the optimal pto damping force dose not alter much with the variation of the draft wave forces in x direction increase with the increase of the draft while not much influences are found in the wave force in y direction the wave moment is not influenced by the draft at a small height of curtain wall yet the largest draft gets the smallest wave moment at a higher curtain wall the wave pressure on the tip of the curtain wall experiences a transition from an increasing into a decreasing trend with the variation of pto damping force pto damping force as the wave frequency kh decreases from 2 2 to 1 72 4 in the aspect of the performance of transmission coefficient and cwr the sensitivity of the draft is the largest of the three factors whose influence on transmission coefficient does not alter much with the variations of the wave frequency and height of curtain wall but decreases with the increase of the height of curtain wall and decrease of the wave frequency on the influence of cwr the pto damping force has a relatively large influence on cwr but a small influence on transmission coefficient in the aspect of the performance of restraining force and moment the draft has the most influence on the restraining force in x direction while the height of curtain wall has the most influence on the restraining moment the sensitivity coefficients of the draft on restraining force increase with the decrease of the wave frequency and that on restraining moment decreases with the increase of the height of curtain wall the potential for cooperation between wave energy utilization and coastal protection has been demonstrated the findings of this study can provide guidance for practical engineering design of the modified geometric shape of combining wave energy conversion and floating breakwater the cost sharing and manufacture convenience achieved through the integrated system may help make wave energy economically competitive and applicable to engineering practice credit authorship contribution statement qiaoling ji conceptualization methodology software investigation writing original draft
