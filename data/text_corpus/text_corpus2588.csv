12940,a cost effective fluoride removal process from groundwater using locally sourced waste materials was postulated for use in remote areas such as northern sri lanka the process is relatively simple to operate reduces fluoride levels to meet who guidelines and uses locally available waste from lime extraction the natural red earth nre waste was a mixture of clays 12 43 wt and iron oxides 8 13 wt deposited on quartz 64 04 wt the smallest mesh size 63 μm of nre was preferred to remove fluoride due to enrichment with aluminium and iron materials fluoride exchange kinetics were relatively fast ca 5 min for nre which was ascribed to sorption sites present in an active coating equilibrium studies revealed a low fluoride loading 0 009 meq g thermal modification of the nre at 350 c increased the maximum fluoride uptake to 0 014 meq g exposure of nre to 1 m hydrochloric acid solution was preferred as the fluoride sorption capacity was promoted to 0 02 meq g protonated surface sites on nre were considered responsible for the enhanced fluoride sorption capacity acid activated nre successfully batch treated simulated groundwater contaminated with fluoride ions to meet who guidelines practically nre may be used in addition to a sand filter and charcoal bed if required to remove organic matter the economics for constructing and using a new nre based treatment system is suitable for rural farming communities in sri lanka keywords fluoride kidney disease sorbent waste groundwater 1 introduction fluoride in low concentrations 1 mg l is beneficial for human health such as providing protection against dental caries 1 exposure to high concentrations of fluoride can result in dental fluorosis and severe cases develop skeletal fluorosis 2 high fluoride concentrations can also damage the nervous system 3 endocrine gland 4 liver and kidneys 5 long term consumption of fluoride rich groundwater has also been discussed as a risk factor for endemic chronic kidney disease of unknown aetiology ckdu with ckdu in rural agricultural villages in dry zone of sri lanka for example particularly prevalent 6 8 many parts of the world especially in asia africa and latin america 9 11 groundwater exceed the world health organization who guideline for fluoride 1 5 mg l drinking groundwater and beverages rich in fluoride contributes to the fluoride intake in sri lanka dietary fluoride intake through fluid is approximately 4 96 mg 12 while the country specific potable water guideline values for fluoride is 1 0 mg l 13 in view of the detrimental health effects resultant from drinking fluoride rich groundwater there is an urgent need to develop a cost effective simple and robust technology for fluoride removal commonly used fluoride removal technologies include ion exchange lime softening membrane filtration and adsorption 14 strong basic ion exchange resins can remove up to 90 to 95 of fluoride ions from the solution nevertheless the high cost of resins selectivity issues requirement of water pre treatment to maintain the ph and high chloride concentrations in the treated water are drawbacks of ion exchange resins 14 15 lime treatment in conjunction with alum treatment has also been successfully used for the defluorination of contaminated water supplies 16 17 however high maintenance costs low fluoride removal 18 33 high solubility of caf2 and residual aluminium species are not advantageous for water treatment 14 15 reverse osmosis ro and nanofiltration nf are also popular techniques used for defluorination high fluoride removal performance combined with the reduction of a wide range of dissolved ions makes this method attractive 18 as such in the ckdu endemic north central province ncp of sri lanka over 2000 ro water treatment stations with a capacity of 7 5 15 m3 per day are in use 19 the negative impacts of ro use include cost concerns by consumers and poor operational maintenance practices which have resulted in low water recovery rates and large brine volumes 19 20 alternatively adsorption ion exchange is a fast widely applicable and inexpensive method used to selectively remove soluble and insoluble contaminants indeed removal efficiencies of up to 90 99 ali and gupta 2006 have been reported which means this process may be a viable option for fluoride removal in poor rural settings 21 a wide range of fluoride sorbents have been produced using low cost materials such as carbon sources clays and wastes which comprise either calcium aluminium or iron 22 26 carbon based sorbents such as biochar 27 28 graphite 29 30 food waste 31 and activated carbon 32 have been used for fluoride removal from aqueous solution however these materials are negatively impacted by not only the low affinity for fluoride ions but also the need to chemically modify the material to improve fluoride sorption capacity 21 clay based materials tested for fluoride removal include natural and modified forms of montmorillonite 33 kaolinite 34 35 smectite 36 37 bentonite 38 39 activated clay 40 and nano clay 41 although the higher surface area of clay minerals is advantageous its fluoride affinity is low due to the negative surface charge zeolite is another mineral widely tested for its fluoride sorption capacity 42 but again the fluoride sorption capacity is not high in contrast iron fe and aluminium al based materials such as iron oxides 43 44 iron nanocomposites 45 46 activated alumina 24 and aluminium hydroxide 47 48 can exhibit excellent fluoride sorption capacities though the cost of these materials is higher than using natural resources and not particularly appropriate for rural areas an important driver for suitable sorbent materials is that they should be locally available not only can the cost of materials be reduced but benefits to the environment occur and jobs may be created in the waste sector in the context of sri lanka natural red earth nre is a rounded quartz sand in a red clay matrix extending 40 km2 in puttalam sri lanka 8 14 50 n and 79 45 45 e on average a 20 m thick nre deposit is removed and disposed as solid waste during limestone mining 49 over 50 of the nre comprises crystalline silica sio2 grains coated by amorphous al2o3 21 and fe2o3 12 50 nre has been studied as a low cost sorbent for the removal of several contaminants especially nephrotoxins vithanage et al 50 attributed the efficient uptake of arsenic as iii and as iv to surface complexation with aloh and feoh sites on the nre nre was identified as effective sorbent of cadmium cd 51 and chromium cr iii 52 nickel ni 53 and antimony sb iii and sb v 54 were also shown to have a high affinity for nre since hydrous oxides of fe and al are known species with demonstrated effectiveness for fluoride sorption 22 23 it was postulated that nre may exhibit suitable fluoride removal properties notably to the best of our knowledge nre has not been evaluated for fluoride uptake from aqueous solutions therefore this study aimed to determine the feasibility of nre for fluoride removal and to develop a simple means of optimising the fluoride sorption performance to enhance the effectiveness the hypothesis served to test if nre is activated correctly to increase the fluoride sorption to be more effective then it may be suitable as a low cost sorbent for fluoride removal in a process that requires minimal technical intervention and or maintenance the following research questions were addressed 1 how do the structural and compositional properties of nre as received and treated vary 2 are the sorption kinetics of fluoride exchange with nre fast or slow 3 what is the equilibrium fluoride sorption capacity of nre as received and treated 4 can nre effectively remove fluoride ions in groundwater 5 is the process simple to use and cost effective in order to address these research questions nre was treated under various temperatures and acid concentrations and characterised to determine any chemical and structural changes the sorbents were then equilibrated with a range of fluoride containing aqueous solutions at bench scale subsequently these sorbents were tested for fluoride removal in simulated groundwater 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials natural red earth was obtained from a limestone mining site in puttalam sri lanka first sand and gravel were removed and then 2 mm fraction was obtained by sieving nre the 2 mm fraction of nre was mechanically sieved to obtain a size fraction 63 μm 2 2 modification of natural red earth 2 2 1 thermal treatment nre samples 12 g 63 μm fraction placed in porcelain dishes were subjected to thermal treatment the treatment temperatures 100 350 and 800 c were established based on the thermogravimetric tga profile after cooling to ambient temperature mass losses were determined the heat treated nre was then ground in a mortar filtered through a 63 μm sieve and finally stored in a desiccator 2 2 2 acid treatment the 63 μm fraction of nre 30 g was placed in four 250 ml nalgene bottles to each bottle 250 ml of either 0 01 0 1 and 1 m hcl or deionized water ph 5 5 was added bottles were then placed on a ratek rotary stirrer for 4 h at 200 rpm allowing acid to react with nre the kaolin modification methodology used by panda et al 55 was slightly modified to be able to use in resource poor settings once stirring was completed samples were vacuum filtered the filtrate was stored for future determination of leached ions the residue was washed with an excessive amount of deionized water to remove residual acid and any soluble compounds the acid treated re was then oven dried at 110 c for 24 h 56 crushed with a mortar and pestle and stored in a desiccator 2 3 material characterization 2 3 1 x ray fluorescence xrf nre samples as received and treated were characterised by x ray fluorescence xrf spectrometry using a panalytical axios 1 kw wavelength dispersive xrf spectrometer micronised samples were combusted at 1050 c for 2 h to remove volatile compounds and to determine gravimetric loss on ignition loi an aliquot of approximately 1 15 g of dried nre samples prepared using conventional li borate fused glass disc approach was used for the analysis 2 3 2 quantitative x ray diffraction xrd x ray diffraction xrd patterns were obtained using a panalytical x pert pro co mpd powder diffractometer the patterns were collected using co kα radiation λ 1 789 a in the range 5 90 2θ corundum al2o3 was added to the sample at 10 wt prior to micronising as the internal standard i e 0 3 g of corundum was micronised with 2 7 g of the sample 57 the rietveld method was used to refine xrd patterns using total pattern analysis solutions topas v5 bruker version 5 software to obtain the mineral phases in nre 2 3 3 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir the samples were analysed on a thermo nicolet is50 abx ftir spectrometer equipped with a kbr beam splitter a single bounce diamond atr and a dlatgs detector with kbr window a minimum of 64 scans was co added with a gain of 4 and optical velocity of 0 6 2 3 4 thermogravimetric analysis tga thermogravimetric analysis of both natural and treated re was performed using a netzsch sta 449f3 simultaneous tg dta dsc approximately 1 g of sample was placed in an aluminium pan and heated from room temperature to 800 c at a rate of 10 c min under a nitrogen environment 2 3 5 surface area and porosity samples were degassed at 105 c under vacuum for 24 h using a vacprep061 sample degas system subsequently the surface area and porosity were measured using a micromeritics tristar ii 3020 system the bet equation and barrett joyner halenda bjh method were used to calculate specific surface area and average pore diameter of both natural and treated re 2 4 solution analysis 2 4 1 ion chromatography ic fluoride solutions were analysed using an ion chromatography ic dionex ics 2100 instrument multielement standard with concentrations ranging between 0 1 ppm 100 ppm prepared using ic grade single element stock solution was used to calibrate the instrument two samples with known element concentrations were alternatively used as quality control in 10 15 sample intervals the samples were filtered with 45 μm syringe filters prior to analysis and dilutions were prepared when required 2 4 2 inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms cation analysis of solutions was performed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms a vista mx ccd simultaneous icp ms instrument was used and the calibrations were performed using multielement standards prepared in house using a single element standard solution 2 5 fluoride sorption properties of nre the constant concentration bottle point method was employed wherein the solute mass was varied while the fluoride concentration in the initial solution was kept constant 58 all experiments were conducted in duplicate to ensure validity of the results all kinetic and equilibrium experiments were conducted at room temperature 25 c using fluoride solutions with ph 6 5 2 5 1 effect of solution ph preliminary sorption investigations were carried out to determine the effect of solution ph on fluoride sorption a series of 10 mg l fluoride solutions 40 ml with ph range between 3 5 and 8 were spiked with as received nre 2 mm fraction and allowed to equilibrate for 24 h under constant agitation final ph of the solutions was then measured and 10 ml samples were taken syringe filtered and analysed for residual fluoride 2 5 2 fluoride sorption kinetic the kinetics of fluoride loading were studied using both as received and 1 m acid treated nre at room temperature and with a 10 mg l initial fluoride concentration kinetic experiments were performed in batches wherein 33 g l of sorbent was measured into a series of 12 plastic vessels along with 30 ml of solution solutions were then allowed to equilibrate under vigorous agitation to ensure adequate mixing for between 10 s to 24 h at set time intervals vessels were removed from the rotating reactor and immediately syringe filtered using 45 μm filters to stop the sorption process the resultant solutions were then analysed for residual fluoride the experimental data were then used to determine kinetic rate constants using non linear forms of pseudo first and second order equations eqs 1 and 2 1 q t q e 1 e k 1 t 2 q t k 2 q e 2 t 1 k 2 q e t where qt f loading at time t qe f loading at equilibrium t time k1 pseudo first order rate constant and k2 pseudo second order rate constant notably errors associated with the use of linearised forms of pseudo first and second order rate equations were minimised using non linear least squares nlls fitting using the solver function in microsoft excel 59 the hybrid error function foo et al 60 was used for the nlls model fitting it is noted that interpretation of sorption kinetic data is often incorrect 61 in practice sorption kinetics data should be placed in the context of an engineering model which does not try and relate pseudo kinetics data to the nature of sorption sites 62 66 2 5 3 fluoride sorption equilibrium isotherms fluoride sorption equilibrium studies were conducted using both 63 μm fraction of as received and treated nre under identical conditions a test solution of 10 mg l f was prepared from the dissolution of naf in 0 01 m nacl which acted as a background electrolyte batch sorption experiments were performed using 30 ml of the 10 mg l fluoride solution with varied masses of sorbent material 5 200 mg l and allowed to equilibrate for 24 h once the equilibration was complete samples were taken and immediately filtered using a syringe filter these filtered samples were analysed for residual fluoride and the equilibrium fluoride loading was calculated using eq 3 3 q e v m c 0 c e where qe equilibrium loading of fluoride meq g v volume of test solution l m mass of the sorbent co initial concentration of fluoride meq l and ce equilibrium concentration of fluoride meq l sorption data was modelled and isotherms were constructed using langmuir vageler eq 4 langmuir eq 5 freundlich eq 6 and aranovich donohue ad eq 7 models non linear least square fitting procedures were again used to minimise the inherently problematic linearised sorption models 60 67 langmuir vageler model in the langmuir vageler model eq 4 sorbate loading was plotted against the driving force of the sorption process the model can be used to determine if an isotherm has reached an appropriate endpoint 58 4 q e c f q max c f k lv where qe sorbate loading at equilibrium meq g klv langmuir vageler constant qmax maximum sorbate loading meq g and cf driving

assumed monolayer sorption of the sorbate on homogeneous sorption sites with constant free energy however in reality fitting equilibrium data to a langmuir model can also mean that the surface is heterogenous 58 66 freundlich model the freundlich model considers surface heterogeneity and an exponential decrease in the heat of sorption with increasing coverage the model also assumes that sorption sites have variable binding energies where low energy sites are occupied after strong sites are filled 67 the model can be used to describe non ideal systems and multilayer formation on heterogeneous systems 60 in essence the freundlich model accounts for different areas on the sorbent wherein langmuir sorption occurs 15 the freundlich equation is given by eq 7 7 q e k f c e 1 n where kf freundlich coefficient l g and n sorption intensity aranovich donohue model the aranovich donohue ad isotherm eq 8 is useful to describe two step sorption mechanisms 67 the model allows

singularity 2 6 fluoride removal in simulated groundwater simulated groundwater was prepared using deionized water and analytical grade chemicals the average groundwater chemistry of medawachchiya sri lanka 69 was considered as the baseline for simulated water compositions the prepared simulated groundwater was allowed to settle for 72 h and any precipitate formed was then filtered batch experiments of fluoride sorption on both acid and heat treated nre samples were performed the sorbent concentrations were 33 g l and the equilibrium time was 4 h the chemistry of the simulated groundwater before and after sorption experiments was recorded all experiments were duplicated to ensure the integrity of results 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of nre initially the impact of particle size upon the composition of nre was investigated table 1 the hypothesis was that preferential breakage of materials in a heterogeneous nre sample may either promote or hinder fluoride sorption overall the major elements present were silicon aluminium iron and titania previous studies of nre also indicated that oxides of silicon aluminium titanium and iron were dominant 50 and described the material as an iron coated sand the presence of iron oxides in the nre sample probably corresponded to the distinctive red colour dahanayake et al 70 recognised the increasing amounts of iron in nre changing the colour from brown to reddish brown and finally to red however relative amounts of silica aluminium and iron present were found to depend on the mesh fraction studied for example the 63 μm sample was significantly enriched with aluminium and iron and diminished in silica vithanage et al 50 also used xrf to analyse a 63 μm sample of nre and reported that sio2 54 15 wt al2o3 20 73 wt fe2o3 12 39 wt and tio2 5 54 wt although broadly similar in composition heterogeneity of the nre sample was clearly observed the composition of nre fraction 63 μm was of particular interest due to its higher aluminium and iron oxide composition compared to coarser fractions the high affinity of iron and aluminium hydroxides towards fluoride 22 43 48 71 72 inferred the finer fraction of nre may have a higher affinity towards fluoride and was therefore selected for fluoride sorption experiments although loi of the finer fraction was relatively high compared to that of coarser fractions 11 and 3 wt respectively it did not necessarily indicate the presence of a large amount of volatile organic matter the finer fraction of soil is generally rich in clay minerals and water adsorbed on those minerals may be attributed to the relatively high loi to gain a comprehensive understanding of the mesh size impact upon nre composition quantitative xrd was performed table 2 quantitative xrd revealed important information concerning the mineralogical composition of the nre quartz was dominant in the largest nre size fraction but reduced significantly in the smaller fraction resistance to chemical weathering may explain the difference in mineral composition between size fractions high chemical weathering resistant quartz was enriched in the coarser fraction 2 mm 250 μm whereas lower chemical weathering resistant kaolinite and iron oxides accumulated in the finer fraction 73 the xrd profile of nre fig a 1 exhibited two distinct peaks at 2θ of 10 and 14 which may have resulted from interlayer basal plane reflections of halloysite anhydrous 10 å and hydrous 7 å 73 alternatively kaolinite with a disordered crystal structure resembles halloysite resulting in peaks at 2θ of 10 å and 7 å 74 the well known formamide test was performed to distinguish between halloysite and disordered kaolinite 75 results confirmed the absence of halloysite in nre fig a 2 suggesting aluminium oxide in nre may be in the form of disordered kaolinite rather than in the form of amorphous al2o3 as previously described by vithanage et al 50 compared to the xrf data iron oxide in the 63 μm fraction of nre appeared to be underestimated in the xrd profile inability to determine the composition of the amorphous phase may explain this discrepancy however the presence of iron oxides together with kaolinite can potentially be advantageous in regard to fluoride sorption iron oxide can improve fluoride uptake of the kaolinite by increasing surface area and surface positive charge 76 77 several studies have shown an increase in fluoride sorption capacity of the kaolinite after treatment with iron oxide 77 80 consequently it was inferred that the kaolinite rich finer fraction of nre is again most suited for modification and fluoride sorption the ftir spectrum of nre fig 1 provided further insight into the structure of nre three distinct bands in the oh stretching region 3500 3700 cm 1 may be assigned to the presence of kaolinite in nre generally kaolinite has distinct peaks at 3646 3670 and 3696 cm 1 resulting from inner surface hydroxyl groups present between sheets and a band at 3622 cm 1 resulting from inner hydroxyl groups of octahedral al oh 81 82 absence of the fourth band at 3670 cm 1 indicated that the kaolinite structure might be disordered inner surface oh groups that bond gibbsite layers of kaolinite with adjoining silica layers are susceptible to disturbance by structural disorder such as displacement of layers or isomorphous substitution 81 the bet specific surface area of as received nre was 46 6 m2 g table 3 notably this value was greater than the surface area of soils rich in clay which generally ranged between 5 and 25 m2 g 55 78 80 83 the higher surface area of nre may be attributed to minor quantities of hematite present 77 where an increase in surface area was observed when kaolinite was mixed with hematite 3 2 characterization of modified nre soil based sorbents generally have a low maximum fluoride loading capacity qmax because clay minerals are negatively charged and have a low affinity towards inorganic anions 35 38 39 84 therefore modification of nre was conducted to potentially improve sorption properties the constraint was that nre when treating groundwater in ckdu affected rural regions of sri lanka will be used by communities of poor farmers with low literacy levels 85 making sophisticated technologies not applicable 20 modification techniques that required minimum technical knowledge and capital were preferred such as thermal treatment or washing of nre in acid solutions a number of studies have successfully used acid treatment to improve the fluoride sorption capacity of soil materials which means a similar approach with nre may be beneficial 55 86 87 3 2 1 heat treated nre the thermal stability of nre was determined initially by thermogravimetric analysis fig a 3 heating nre 63 μm resulted in the appearance of two distinct weight losses with a total weight loss of 12 fig a 3 the first weight loss of 2 6 occurred below 100 c and may be attributed to the removal of water physisorbed to nre the second weight loss of 9 4 occurred between 400 and 550 c was also accompanied by an endothermic peak as identified by differential scanning calorimetry dsc this mass loss may result from the dehydroxylation of kaolinite the major mineral constituent 65 6 in nre eq 9 dehydroxylation of kaolinite forms amorphous metakaolinite by the collapse of interlayer spacing 9 al 2 si 2 o 5 oh 4 al 2 o 3 2 si o 2 2 h 2 o g in agreement with the data in fig a 3 significant changes were not observed in xrd profiles of nre treated at 100 and 350 c fig 2 however upon heating the nre sample to 800 c reflections at 14 23 and 27 degrees 2θ indicative of clay disappeared this behaviour was consistent with the transformation of clay to metakaolin upon heating above temperatures of 500 c 81 the ftir spectra fig 1 likewise indicated that a dehydroxylation process occurred at 800 c characteristic kaolinite bands in the oh stretching region 3646 3696 and 3622 cm 1 si o stretching vibration bands at 1117 685 468 and 421 cm 1 and al o si deformation band at 750 cm 1 all reduced in intensity bands that were recorded to grow at 531 and 429 cm 1 may indicate the formation of new si o phases induced by the thermal treatment these observed changes to the ftir profile upon heating were in accord with previous studies which reported the formation of amorphous metakaolinite from kaolinite at high temperatures 55 78 table 3 also revealed that a loss in bet surface area of approximately 10 accompanied the formation of metakaolinite which again agreed with the literature of 79 80 aggregation of aluminium and iron oxide and hydration and hydroxylation of clay at higher temperatures may be attributed to the reduced surface area 79 3 2 2 acid treated nre acid treatment was evaluated to determine if this approach may improve the fluoride sorption properties of nre this idea was in harmony with results that indicated increasing protonated sites in soils consisting of aluminium and iron oxyhydroxides by acid treatment and increased anion sorption 84 88 xrd revealed that the intensity of characteristic peaks for kaolinite 2θ of 14 23 and 27 were not significantly influenced by the acid treatment fig 3 a similarly significant changes were not observed in the ftir spectra of the acid treated nre fig 3 b 3 3 fluoride sorption onto nre 3 3 1 effect of solution ph on fluoride sorption the effect of solution ph on fluoride sorption onto nre as received 2 mm fraction is given in fig 4 the highest fluoride sorption occurred under acidic conditions and gradually decreased with the increase in solution ph the reduced fluoride sorption capacity with increasing ph may be attributed to the competition between oh and f for the sorption sites similar fluoride sorption trends were observed onto kaolinite and goethite containing soil by osei et al 84 and on kaolinite by meenakshi et al 89 3 3 2 fluoride sorption kinetics of nre it was initially important to determine the time required for the equilibrium uptake of fluoride ions on nre therefore fig 5 shows kinetic data for fluoride sorption onto nre as received nre after heating at 350 c and nre exposed to 1 m hydrochloric acid the pseudo second order kinetic model is illustrated as it was found to exhibit the smallest sum of errors when conducting non linear least squares fitting of the data fluoride uptake on both heat and acid treated nres followed a two step process with a rapid initial loading of fluoride ions followed by a slower second phase most of the fluoride uptake was achieved within 5 min during which 26 and 78 of fluoride species were removed from the aqueous solution by 350 c treated nre and 1 m acid treated nre respectively extending the exchange period to 24 h slightly promoted fluoride removal to 30 and 87 of fluoride for 350 c treated nre and 1 m acid treated nre respectively in contrast as received nre was characterised by less than 20 fluoride removal one explanation for the relatively fast fluoride uptake may be the availability of many sorption sites compared to the amount of sorbate 40 however as a substantial quantity of nre relative to the volume of water treated was required in this study this proposition appears unlikely alternatively if most fluoride loading occurs on a surface coating then the inhibition of fluoride uptake in small pores may be negated notably with microporous materials such as zeolites the time to achieve equilibrium uptake of exchangeable species in solution can take several days and not minutes 90 3 3 3 fluoride sorption equilibrium on nre fluoride sorption equilibrium data was modelled using various isotherm equations fig 6 as a general observation heating nre at 100 and 350 c had a positive impact on fluoride loading capacity while heating at 800 c reduced fluoride loading table 4 and fig 6 the variation in fluoride loading capacity may attribute to the changes in surface area with the heat treatment this is in accordance with osei et al 84 which reported optimum fluoride sorption onto kaolinite and goethite containing soil when heat treated at 400 c the langmuir vageler isotherm profiles for the heated nre samples confirmed that the test conditions were suitable to ensure a complete equilibrium profile 58 91 92 use of an appropriate driving force is crucial in determining qmax and avoiding data fitting errors 67 92 the shape of the isotherm profile was distinctly different for the as received nre sample the equilibrium data indicated that during the initial stage of fluoride loading the curve was favourable i e convex 93 at higher fluoride loadings a concave curve was recorded which was either typical of an unfavourable sorption process 93 or a sign of multilayer sorption of fluoride ions 58 in each case the aranovich donohue model was preferred to fit the experimental data as this equation can simulate more complex equilibrium curves the observed sum of errors was notably lower when using the aranovich donohue model for as received nre 0 003 compared to 0 008 to 0 013 for alternate equilibrium isotherm equations heating of the nre to 100 and 350 c not only changed the shape of the equilibrium profile to a convex favourable isotherm but also significantly increased the fluoride loading fig 6 in terms of fitting the equilibrium data the langmuir model was deemed to be challenging as a plateau was not found in the equilibrium profile potentially causing over estimation of maximum fluoride uptake 67 the freundlich model was inherently better at fitting equilibrium profiles which do not show a plateau in the data 93 the magnitude of freundlich exponents of heat treated nre ranged between 1 01 and 2 42 which indicated the favourability of heat treated nre towards fluoride 94 previous studies also show the sorption of as v 95 ni 53 and sb iii 54 onto nre was best fitted with the freundlich model due to surface heterogeneity the impact of activation of nre with acid upon subsequent equilibrium profiles for fluoride uptake are shown in fig 7 langmuir vageler plots suggest that isotherm profiles may plateau when the ratio of fluoride ions to acid treated nre in initial solutions exceeded 0 1 meq g the q max values for fluoride equilibrium loading on hcl treated nre increased to 0 02 meq g when using 1 m acid langmuir model the freundlich isotherm was generally a slightly improved fit for fluoride uptake on acid modified nre as was the aranovich donohue model regardless of the model applied to the sorption data it was apparent that acid pre treatment of nre improved the fluoride equilibrium performance in order to reduce initial fluoride concentration of 10 mg l below who safe drinking water guideline values approximately 63 50 and 40 mg l of 0 01 m 0 1 m and 1 m acid treated nre respectively were required compared to nre as received 1 m acid treatment reduced the amount of nre required to obtain 90 fluoride loading from 10 mg l solution by two thirds 3 3 4 fluoride sorption mechanism on nre it was pertinent to examine whether an ion exchange or adsorption process was the mechanism for removal of fluoride ions from solution using nre consequently the quantity of anion species cl and so4 released into solution in comparison with the amount of fluoride ions loaded onto the nre sample was calculated fig 8 the amount of anions desorbed when fluoride was loaded on 350 c heat treated nre was similar to the amount of ions desorbed fig 8 a in contrast the amount of fluoride equivalents sorbed onto 1 m acid treated nre was considerablly higher than the amount of anions released fig 8 b this evidence indicates an ion exchange process probably occured when using heated nre samples to remove fluoride from solution whereas an adsorption process was the favoured means of removing fluoride from solution when using acid treated nre one fluoride sorption mechanism may be the exchange of surface oh groups aloh and feoh represented as soh with fluoride eq 11 88 96 10 soh f sf o h the major fluoride loading mechanism onto 1 m acid treated nre may be hydrogen bond formation between the protonated surface aloh and feoh sites represented as soh surface hydroxyl sites of the nre can undergo protonation during acid treatment eq 11 protonated hydroxyl sites form strong hydrogen bonds with fluoride ions in the solution reducing fluoride concentration eqs 12 13 11 soh h so h 2 12 so h 2 f so h 2 f 13 so h 2 f sf h 2 o the formation of hydrogen bonds between protonated sorbent surface and fluoride in the solution has also been reported by errais et al 97 who indicated that hydrogen bond formation with protonated kaolinite surface sites was the major fluoride sorption mechanism under acidic conditions therefore protonation of surface sites is probably responsible for the superior optimum fluoride loading capacity of acid treated nre compared to heat treated nre the degree of protonation depends on the strength of the acid used for the activation treatment of nre table 4 however high acid concentrations greater than 3 m can also reduce fluoride sorption capacity by dehydroxylation of the kaolinite 55 3 4 fluoride removal from simulated groundwater to determine the influence of competing anions such as chloride bicarbonate and sulphate on fluoride sorption simulated groundwater was prepared table 5 shows water quality data before and after treating simulated groundwater with 1 m acid treated nre the nre sorbent successfully removed fluoride below the who safe drinking water guidelines within 2 min of contact time however the loading of fluoride ions observed when treating simulated groundwater compared with sodium fluoride sodium chloride solutions was reduced from 0 02 mmol f per g nre to 0 09 mmol f per g nre one reason for this behaviour may be the higher ph of simulated groundwater which may favour sorption of hydroxyl ions instead of fluoride ions 34 35 a second reason for the reduced fluoride sorption may be the negative influence of bicarbonate ions due to their affinity towards clay minerals 25 34 98 albeit this situation may be an added advantage in terms of improving the palatability of hard water in the ckdu endemic regions of sri lanka 99 concentrations of nitrate and sulphate remained constant after the treatment as did the solution ph the constant ph may be at least partly attributed to the presence of a carbonate bicarbonate buffer in simulated groundwater 3 5 practical applications fluoride removal from groundwater in terms of practical use of the acid modified nre due to fine size of 63 μm grains a simple batch sorption process is preferred to a treatment column in a column system the presence of small particles will result in excessive backpressure due to the blockages within the column additionally a column promotes system complexity and is therefore undesirable for use by poor farmers in rural areas instead a basic water filter made of two water baskets can be used to treat fluoride rich groundwater fig 9 the water can be added to the uppermost bucket spiked with an adequate amount of modified nre and mixed well for 5 min before settling once the sorbent is settled water can be transferred to a second bucket in the bottom which contains a sand filter this type of user friendly filter should last for at least five years and cost approximately lkr 3100 table a 1 the approximate cost of 1 l of water treated with this filter below who guideline value is predicted to be lkr 0 50 compared to lkr 1 00 3 50 for ro treated water table a 2 treating 1 l of groundwater according to the sl guideline value costs additional lkr 0 34 this basic filter satisfies key criteria such as being low cost technically simple low maintenance minimal waste ca 6 kg of sludge per month per family and makes use of local waste materials the production of fluoride sorbent and two bucket filter will produce valuable job opportunities for individuals in the region where for example a medium scale factory can employ four trained workers to produce acid treated nre 4 conclusions this study confirmed the hypothesis that a novel low cost method for fluoride removal from groundwater in ckdu endemic regions in sri lanka can be obtained using locally sourced mining waste natural red earth a waste product is naturally heterogeneous in character with the main components identified as quartz clays and iron oxides smaller grain sizes contained relatively more clay than quartz because of weathering processes heat activation converted the kaolin component to metakaolin whereas acid treatment did not notably impact the bulk structure of nre activation of the nre was preferably achieved by pre treatment with 1 m hydrochloric acid solutions a strategy that protonated sites on the nre surface which promoted adsorption of fluoride ions the exchange kinetics of fluoride ions with nre were relatively fast 5 min and this behaviour was ascribed to the fact this material comprises a coating wherein the active sorption sites were located equilibrium studies demonstrated that both thermal activation and acid activation increased the equilibrium loading of fluoride ions although the loadings were not high in comparison to commercial materials such as activated alumina nre was available locally in sri lanka cheaper and simple to use mechanistically heat treated nre appeared to remove fluoride ions using ion exchange in contrast acid activated nre operated by means of adsorption on protonated surface sites activated nre was ideal for use in a simple batch water treatment process a basic filter was created using two buckets coupled to a sand filter the sand filter may include other media such as charcoal to remove any organic matter in the water if required estimated capital costs appeared to be acceptable for deployment in rural farming communities in sri lanka although the volume of used nre was relatively small there remains potential to determine if this waste can be reused declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

12940,a cost effective fluoride removal process from groundwater using locally sourced waste materials was postulated for use in remote areas such as northern sri lanka the process is relatively simple to operate reduces fluoride levels to meet who guidelines and uses locally available waste from lime extraction the natural red earth nre waste was a mixture of clays 12 43 wt and iron oxides 8 13 wt deposited on quartz 64 04 wt the smallest mesh size 63 μm of nre was preferred to remove fluoride due to enrichment with aluminium and iron materials fluoride exchange kinetics were relatively fast ca 5 min for nre which was ascribed to sorption sites present in an active coating equilibrium studies revealed a low fluoride loading 0 009 meq g thermal modification of the nre at 350 c increased the maximum fluoride uptake to 0 014 meq g exposure of nre to 1 m hydrochloric acid solution was preferred as the fluoride sorption capacity was promoted to 0 02 meq g protonated surface sites on nre were considered responsible for the enhanced fluoride sorption capacity acid activated nre successfully batch treated simulated groundwater contaminated with fluoride ions to meet who guidelines practically nre may be used in addition to a sand filter and charcoal bed if required to remove organic matter the economics for constructing and using a new nre based treatment system is suitable for rural farming communities in sri lanka keywords fluoride kidney disease sorbent waste groundwater 1 introduction fluoride in low concentrations 1 mg l is beneficial for human health such as providing protection against dental caries 1 exposure to high concentrations of fluoride can result in dental fluorosis and severe cases develop skeletal fluorosis 2 high fluoride concentrations can also damage the nervous system 3 endocrine gland 4 liver and kidneys 5 long term consumption of fluoride rich groundwater has also been discussed as a risk factor for endemic chronic kidney disease of unknown aetiology ckdu with ckdu in rural agricultural villages in dry zone of sri lanka for example particularly prevalent 6 8 many parts of the world especially in asia africa and latin america 9 11 groundwater exceed the world health organization who guideline for fluoride 1 5 mg l drinking groundwater and beverages rich in fluoride contributes to the fluoride intake in sri lanka dietary fluoride intake through fluid is approximately 4 96 mg 12 while the country specific potable water guideline values for fluoride is 1 0 mg l 13 in view of the detrimental health effects resultant from drinking fluoride rich groundwater there is an urgent need to develop a cost effective simple and robust technology for fluoride removal commonly used fluoride removal technologies include ion exchange lime softening membrane filtration and adsorption 14 strong basic ion exchange resins can remove up to 90 to 95 of fluoride ions from the solution nevertheless the high cost of resins selectivity issues requirement of water pre treatment to maintain the ph and high chloride concentrations in the treated water are drawbacks of ion exchange resins 14 15 lime treatment in conjunction with alum treatment has also been successfully used for the defluorination of contaminated water supplies 16 17 however high maintenance costs low fluoride removal 18 33 high solubility of caf2 and residual aluminium species are not advantageous for water treatment 14 15 reverse osmosis ro and nanofiltration nf are also popular techniques used for defluorination high fluoride removal performance combined with the reduction of a wide range of dissolved ions makes this method attractive 18 as such in the ckdu endemic north central province ncp of sri lanka over 2000 ro water treatment stations with a capacity of 7 5 15 m3 per day are in use 19 the negative impacts of ro use include cost concerns by consumers and poor operational maintenance practices which have resulted in low water recovery rates and large brine volumes 19 20 alternatively adsorption ion exchange is a fast widely applicable and inexpensive method used to selectively remove soluble and insoluble contaminants indeed removal efficiencies of up to 90 99 ali and gupta 2006 have been reported which means this process may be a viable option for fluoride removal in poor rural settings 21 a wide range of fluoride sorbents have been produced using low cost materials such as carbon sources clays and wastes which comprise either calcium aluminium or iron 22 26 carbon based sorbents such as biochar 27 28 graphite 29 30 food waste 31 and activated carbon 32 have been used for fluoride removal from aqueous solution however these materials are negatively impacted by not only the low affinity for fluoride ions but also the need to chemically modify the material to improve fluoride sorption capacity 21 clay based materials tested for fluoride removal include natural and modified forms of montmorillonite 33 kaolinite 34 35 smectite 36 37 bentonite 38 39 activated clay 40 and nano clay 41 although the higher surface area of clay minerals is advantageous its fluoride affinity is low due to the negative surface charge zeolite is another mineral widely tested for its fluoride sorption capacity 42 but again the fluoride sorption capacity is not high in contrast iron fe and aluminium al based materials such as iron oxides 43 44 iron nanocomposites 45 46 activated alumina 24 and aluminium hydroxide 47 48 can exhibit excellent fluoride sorption capacities though the cost of these materials is higher than using natural resources and not particularly appropriate for rural areas an important driver for suitable sorbent materials is that they should be locally available not only can the cost of materials be reduced but benefits to the environment occur and jobs may be created in the waste sector in the context of sri lanka natural red earth nre is a rounded quartz sand in a red clay matrix extending 40 km2 in puttalam sri lanka 8 14 50 n and 79 45 45 e on average a 20 m thick nre deposit is removed and disposed as solid waste during limestone mining 49 over 50 of the nre comprises crystalline silica sio2 grains coated by amorphous al2o3 21 and fe2o3 12 50 nre has been studied as a low cost sorbent for the removal of several contaminants especially nephrotoxins vithanage et al 50 attributed the efficient uptake of arsenic as iii and as iv to surface complexation with aloh and feoh sites on the nre nre was identified as effective sorbent of cadmium cd 51 and chromium cr iii 52 nickel ni 53 and antimony sb iii and sb v 54 were also shown to have a high affinity for nre since hydrous oxides of fe and al are known species with demonstrated effectiveness for fluoride sorption 22 23 it was postulated that nre may exhibit suitable fluoride removal properties notably to the best of our knowledge nre has not been evaluated for fluoride uptake from aqueous solutions therefore this study aimed to determine the feasibility of nre for fluoride removal and to develop a simple means of optimising the fluoride sorption performance to enhance the effectiveness the hypothesis served to test if nre is activated correctly to increase the fluoride sorption to be more effective then it may be suitable as a low cost sorbent for fluoride removal in a process that requires minimal technical intervention and or maintenance the following research questions were addressed 1 how do the structural and compositional properties of nre as received and treated vary 2 are the sorption kinetics of fluoride exchange with nre fast or slow 3 what is the equilibrium fluoride sorption capacity of nre as received and treated 4 can nre effectively remove fluoride ions in groundwater 5 is the process simple to use and cost effective in order to address these research questions nre was treated under various temperatures and acid concentrations and characterised to determine any chemical and structural changes the sorbents were then equilibrated with a range of fluoride containing aqueous solutions at bench scale subsequently these sorbents were tested for fluoride removal in simulated groundwater 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials natural red earth was obtained from a limestone mining site in puttalam sri lanka first sand and gravel were removed and then 2 mm fraction was obtained by sieving nre the 2 mm fraction of nre was mechanically sieved to obtain a size fraction 63 μm 2 2 modification of natural red earth 2 2 1 thermal treatment nre samples 12 g 63 μm fraction placed in porcelain dishes were subjected to thermal treatment the treatment temperatures 100 350 and 800 c were established based on the thermogravimetric tga profile after cooling to ambient temperature mass losses were determined the heat treated nre was then ground in a mortar filtered through a 63 μm sieve and finally stored in a desiccator 2 2 2 acid treatment the 63 μm fraction of nre 30 g was placed in four 250 ml nalgene bottles to each bottle 250 ml of either 0 01 0 1 and 1 m hcl or deionized water ph 5 5 was added bottles were then placed on a ratek rotary stirrer for 4 h at 200 rpm allowing acid to react with nre the kaolin modification methodology used by panda et al 55 was slightly modified to be able to use in resource poor settings once stirring was completed samples were vacuum filtered the filtrate was stored for future determination of leached ions the residue was washed with an excessive amount of deionized water to remove residual acid and any soluble compounds the acid treated re was then oven dried at 110 c for 24 h 56 crushed with a mortar and pestle and stored in a desiccator 2 3 material characterization 2 3 1 x ray fluorescence xrf nre samples as received and treated were characterised by x ray fluorescence xrf spectrometry using a panalytical axios 1 kw wavelength dispersive xrf spectrometer micronised samples were combusted at 1050 c for 2 h to remove volatile compounds and to determine gravimetric loss on ignition loi an aliquot of approximately 1 15 g of dried nre samples prepared using conventional li borate fused glass disc approach was used for the analysis 2 3 2 quantitative x ray diffraction xrd x ray diffraction xrd patterns were obtained using a panalytical x pert pro co mpd powder diffractometer the patterns were collected using co kα radiation λ 1 789 a in the range 5 90 2θ corundum al2o3 was added to the sample at 10 wt prior to micronising as the internal standard i e 0 3 g of corundum was micronised with 2 7 g of the sample 57 the rietveld method was used to refine xrd patterns using total pattern analysis solutions topas v5 bruker version 5 software to obtain the mineral phases in nre 2 3 3 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir the samples were analysed on a thermo nicolet is50 abx ftir spectrometer equipped with a kbr beam splitter a single bounce diamond atr and a dlatgs detector with kbr window a minimum of 64 scans was co added with a gain of 4 and optical velocity of 0 6 2 3 4 thermogravimetric analysis tga thermogravimetric analysis of both natural and treated re was performed using a netzsch sta 449f3 simultaneous tg dta dsc approximately 1 g of sample was placed in an aluminium pan and heated from room temperature to 800 c at a rate of 10 c min under a nitrogen environment 2 3 5 surface area and porosity samples were degassed at 105 c under vacuum for 24 h using a vacprep061 sample degas system subsequently the surface area and porosity were measured using a micromeritics tristar ii 3020 system the bet equation and barrett joyner halenda bjh method were used to calculate specific surface area and average pore diameter of both natural and treated re 2 4 solution analysis 2 4 1 ion chromatography ic fluoride solutions were analysed using an ion chromatography ic dionex ics 2100 instrument multielement standard with concentrations ranging between 0 1 ppm 100 ppm prepared using ic grade single element stock solution was used to calibrate the instrument two samples with known element concentrations were alternatively used as quality control in 10 15 sample intervals the samples were filtered with 45 μm syringe filters prior to analysis and dilutions were prepared when required 2 4 2 inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms cation analysis of solutions was performed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms a vista mx ccd simultaneous icp ms instrument was used and the calibrations were performed using multielement standards prepared in house using a single element standard solution 2 5 fluoride sorption properties of nre the constant concentration bottle point method was employed wherein the solute mass was varied while the fluoride concentration in the initial solution was kept constant 58 all experiments were conducted in duplicate to ensure validity of the results all kinetic and equilibrium experiments were conducted at room temperature 25 c using fluoride solutions with ph 6 5 2 5 1 effect of solution ph preliminary sorption investigations were carried out to determine the effect of solution ph on fluoride sorption a series of 10 mg l fluoride solutions 40 ml with ph range between 3 5 and 8 were spiked with as received nre 2 mm fraction and allowed to equilibrate for 24 h under constant agitation final ph of the solutions was then measured and 10 ml samples were taken syringe filtered and analysed for residual fluoride 2 5 2 fluoride sorption kinetic the kinetics of fluoride loading were studied using both as received and 1 m acid treated nre at room temperature and with a 10 mg l initial fluoride concentration kinetic experiments were performed in batches wherein 33 g l of sorbent was measured into a series of 12 plastic vessels along with 30 ml of solution solutions were then allowed to equilibrate under vigorous agitation to ensure adequate mixing for between 10 s to 24 h at set time intervals vessels were removed from the rotating reactor and immediately syringe filtered using 45 μm filters to stop the sorption process the resultant solutions were then analysed for residual fluoride the experimental data were then used to determine kinetic rate constants using non linear forms of pseudo first and second order equations eqs 1 and 2 1 q t q e 1 e k 1 t 2 q t k 2 q e 2 t 1 k 2 q e t where qt f loading at time t qe f loading at equilibrium t time k1 pseudo first order rate constant and k2 pseudo second order rate constant notably errors associated with the use of linearised forms of pseudo first and second order rate equations were minimised using non linear least squares nlls fitting using the solver function in microsoft excel 59 the hybrid error function foo et al 60 was used for the nlls model fitting it is noted that interpretation of sorption kinetic data is often incorrect 61 in practice sorption kinetics data should be placed in the context of an engineering model which does not try and relate pseudo kinetics data to the nature of sorption sites 62 66 2 5 3 fluoride sorption equilibrium isotherms fluoride sorption equilibrium studies were conducted using both 63 μm fraction of as received and treated nre under identical conditions a test solution of 10 mg l f was prepared from the dissolution of naf in 0 01 m nacl which acted as a background electrolyte batch sorption experiments were performed using 30 ml of the 10 mg l fluoride solution with varied masses of sorbent material 5 200 mg l and allowed to equilibrate for 24 h once the equilibration was complete samples were taken and immediately filtered using a syringe filter these filtered samples were analysed for residual fluoride and the equilibrium fluoride loading was calculated using eq 3 3 q e v m c 0 c e where qe equilibrium loading of fluoride meq g v volume of test solution l m mass of the sorbent co initial concentration of fluoride meq l and ce equilibrium concentration of fluoride meq l sorption data was modelled and isotherms were constructed using langmuir vageler eq 4 langmuir eq 5 freundlich eq 6 and aranovich donohue ad eq 7 models non linear least square fitting procedures were again used to minimise the inherently problematic linearised sorption models 60 67 langmuir vageler model in the langmuir vageler model eq 4 sorbate loading was plotted against the driving force of the sorption process the model can be used to determine if an isotherm has reached an appropriate endpoint 58 4 q e c f q max c f k lv where qe sorbate loading at equilibrium meq g klv langmuir vageler constant qmax maximum sorbate loading meq g and cf driving

assumed monolayer sorption of the sorbate on homogeneous sorption sites with constant free energy however in reality fitting equilibrium data to a langmuir model can also mean that the surface is heterogenous 58 66 freundlich model the freundlich model considers surface heterogeneity and an exponential decrease in the heat of sorption with increasing coverage the model also assumes that sorption sites have variable binding energies where low energy sites are occupied after strong sites are filled 67 the model can be used to describe non ideal systems and multilayer formation on heterogeneous systems 60 in essence the freundlich model accounts for different areas on the sorbent wherein langmuir sorption occurs 15 the freundlich equation is given by eq 7 7 q e k f c e 1 n

singularity 2 6 fluoride removal in simulated groundwater simulated groundwater was prepared using deionized water and analytical grade chemicals the average groundwater chemistry of medawachchiya sri lanka 69 was considered as the baseline for simulated water compositions the prepared simulated groundwater was allowed to settle for 72 h and any precipitate formed was then filtered batch experiments of fluoride sorption on both acid and heat treated nre samples were performed the sorbent concentrations were 33 g l and the equilibrium time was 4 h the chemistry of the simulated groundwater before and after sorption experiments was recorded all experiments were duplicated to ensure the integrity of results 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of nre initially the impact of particle size upon the composition of nre was investigated table 1 the hypothesis was that preferential breakage of materials in a heterogeneous nre sample may either promote or hinder fluoride sorption overall the major elements present were silicon aluminium iron and titania previous studies of nre also indicated that oxides of silicon aluminium titanium and iron were dominant 50 and described the material as an iron coated sand the presence of iron oxides in the nre sample probably corresponded to the distinctive red colour dahanayake et al 70 recognised the increasing amounts of iron in nre changing the colour from brown to reddish brown and finally to red however relative amounts of silica aluminium and iron present were found to depend on the mesh fraction studied for example the 63 μm sample was significantly enriched with aluminium and iron and diminished in silica vithanage et al 50 also used xrf to analyse a 63 μm sample of nre and reported that sio2 54 15 wt al2o3 20 73 wt fe2o3 12 39 wt and tio2 5 54 wt although broadly similar in composition heterogeneity of the nre sample was clearly observed the composition of nre fraction 63 μm was of particular interest due to its higher aluminium and iron oxide composition compared to coarser fractions the high affinity of iron and aluminium hydroxides towards fluoride 22 43 48 71 72 inferred the finer fraction of nre may have a higher affinity towards fluoride and was therefore selected for fluoride sorption experiments although loi of the finer fraction was relatively high compared to that of coarser fractions 11 and 3 wt respectively it did not necessarily indicate the presence of a large amount of volatile organic matter the finer fraction of soil is generally rich in clay minerals and water adsorbed on those minerals may be attributed to the relatively high loi to gain a comprehensive understanding of the mesh size impact upon nre composition quantitative xrd was performed table 2 quantitative xrd revealed important information concerning the mineralogical composition of the nre quartz was dominant in the largest nre size fraction but reduced significantly in the smaller fraction resistance to chemical weathering may explain the difference in mineral composition between size fractions high chemical weathering resistant quartz was enriched in the coarser fraction 2 mm 250 μm whereas lower chemical weathering resistant kaolinite and iron oxides accumulated in the finer fraction 73 the xrd profile of nre fig a 1 exhibited two distinct peaks at 2θ of 10 and 14 which may have resulted from interlayer basal plane reflections of halloysite anhydrous 10 å and hydrous 7 å 73 alternatively kaolinite with a disordered crystal structure resembles halloysite resulting in peaks at 2θ of 10 å and 7 å 74 the well known formamide test was performed to distinguish between halloysite and disordered kaolinite 75 results confirmed the absence of halloysite in nre fig a 2 suggesting aluminium oxide in nre may be in the form of disordered kaolinite rather than in the form of amorphous al2o3 as previously described by vithanage et al 50 compared to the xrf data iron oxide in the 63 μm fraction of nre appeared to be underestimated in the xrd profile inability to determine the composition of the amorphous phase may explain this discrepancy however the presence of iron oxides together with kaolinite can potentially be advantageous in regard to fluoride sorption iron oxide can improve fluoride uptake of the kaolinite by increasing surface area and surface positive charge 76 77 several studies have shown an increase in fluoride sorption capacity of the kaolinite after treatment with iron oxide 77 80 consequently it was inferred that the kaolinite rich finer fraction of nre is again most suited for modification and fluoride sorption the ftir spectrum of nre fig 1 provided further insight into the structure of nre three distinct bands in the oh stretching region 3500 3700 cm 1 may be assigned to the presence of kaolinite in nre generally kaolinite has distinct peaks at 3646 3670 and 3696 cm 1 resulting from inner surface hydroxyl groups present between sheets and a band at 3622 cm 1 resulting from inner hydroxyl groups of octahedral al oh 81 82 absence of the fourth band at 3670 cm 1 indicated that the kaolinite structure might be disordered inner surface oh groups that bond gibbsite layers of kaolinite with adjoining silica layers are susceptible to disturbance by structural disorder such as displacement of layers or isomorphous substitution 81 the bet specific surface area of as received nre was 46 6 m2 g table 3 notably this value was greater than the surface area of soils rich in clay which generally ranged between 5 and 25 m2 g 55 78 80 83 the higher surface area of nre may be attributed to minor quantities of hematite present 77 where an increase in surface area was observed when kaolinite was mixed with hematite 3 2 characterization of modified nre soil based sorbents generally have a low maximum fluoride loading capacity qmax because clay minerals are negatively charged and have a low affinity towards inorganic anions 35 38 39 84 therefore modification of nre was conducted to potentially improve sorption properties the constraint was that nre when treating groundwater in ckdu affected rural regions of sri lanka will be used by communities of poor farmers with low literacy levels 85 making sophisticated technologies not applicable 20 modification techniques that required minimum technical knowledge and capital were preferred such as thermal treatment or washing of nre in acid solutions a number of studies have successfully used acid treatment to improve the fluoride sorption capacity of soil materials which means a similar approach with nre may be beneficial 55 86 87 3 2 1 heat treated nre the thermal stability of nre was determined initially by thermogravimetric analysis fig a 3 heating nre 63 μm resulted in the appearance of two distinct weight losses with a total weight loss of 12 fig a 3 the first weight loss of 2 6 occurred below 100 c and may be attributed to the removal of water physisorbed to nre the second weight loss of 9 4 occurred between 400 and 550 c was also accompanied by an endothermic peak as identified by differential scanning calorimetry dsc this mass loss may result from the dehydroxylation of kaolinite the major mineral constituent 65 6 in nre eq 9 dehydroxylation of kaolinite forms amorphous metakaolinite by the collapse of interlayer spacing 9 al 2 si 2 o 5 oh 4 al 2 o 3 2 si o 2 2 h 2 o g in agreement with the data in fig a 3 significant changes were not observed in xrd profiles of nre treated at 100 and 350 c fig 2 however upon heating the nre sample to 800 c reflections at 14 23 and 27 degrees 2θ indicative of clay disappeared this behaviour was consistent with the transformation of clay to metakaolin upon heating above temperatures of 500 c 81 the ftir spectra fig 1 likewise indicated that a dehydroxylation process occurred at 800 c characteristic kaolinite bands in the oh stretching region 3646 3696 and 3622 cm 1 si o stretching vibration bands at 1117 685 468 and 421 cm 1 and al o si deformation band at 750 cm 1 all reduced in intensity bands that were recorded to grow at 531 and 429 cm 1 may indicate the formation of new si o phases induced by the thermal treatment these observed changes to the ftir profile upon heating were in accord with previous studies which reported the formation of amorphous metakaolinite from kaolinite at high temperatures 55 78 table 3 also revealed that a loss in bet surface area of approximately 10 accompanied the formation of metakaolinite which again agreed with the literature of 79 80 aggregation of aluminium and iron oxide and hydration and hydroxylation of clay at higher temperatures may be attributed to the reduced surface area 79 3 2 2 acid treated nre acid treatment was evaluated to determine if this approach may improve the fluoride sorption properties of nre this idea was in harmony with results that indicated increasing protonated sites in soils consisting of aluminium and iron oxyhydroxides by acid treatment and increased anion sorption 84 88 xrd revealed that the intensity of characteristic peaks for kaolinite 2θ of 14 23 and 27 were not significantly influenced by the acid treatment fig 3 a similarly significant changes were not observed in the ftir spectra of the acid treated nre fig 3 b 3 3 fluoride sorption onto nre 3 3 1 effect of solution ph on fluoride sorption the effect of solution ph on fluoride sorption onto nre as received 2 mm fraction is given in fig 4 the highest fluoride sorption occurred under acidic conditions and gradually decreased with the increase in solution ph the reduced fluoride sorption capacity with increasing ph may be attributed to the competition between oh and f for the sorption sites similar fluoride sorption trends were observed onto kaolinite and goethite containing soil by osei et al 84 and on kaolinite by meenakshi et al 89 3 3 2 fluoride sorption kinetics of nre it was initially important to determine the time required for the equilibrium uptake of fluoride ions on nre therefore fig 5 shows kinetic data for fluoride sorption onto nre as received nre after heating at 350 c and nre exposed to 1 m hydrochloric acid the pseudo second order kinetic model is illustrated as it was found to exhibit the smallest sum of errors when conducting non linear least squares fitting of the data fluoride uptake on both heat and acid treated nres followed a two step process with a rapid initial loading of fluoride ions followed by a slower second phase most of the fluoride uptake was achieved within 5 min during which 26 and 78 of fluoride species were removed from the aqueous solution by 350 c treated nre and 1 m acid treated nre respectively extending the exchange period to 24 h slightly promoted fluoride removal to 30 and 87 of fluoride for 350 c treated nre and 1 m acid treated nre respectively in contrast as received nre was characterised by less than 20 fluoride removal one explanation for the relatively fast fluoride uptake may be the availability of many sorption sites compared to the amount of sorbate 40 however as a substantial quantity of nre relative to the volume of water treated was required in this study this proposition appears unlikely alternatively if most fluoride loading occurs on a surface coating then the inhibition of fluoride uptake in small pores may be negated notably with microporous materials such as zeolites the time to achieve equilibrium uptake of exchangeable species in solution can take several days and not minutes 90 3 3 3 fluoride sorption equilibrium on nre fluoride sorption equilibrium data was modelled using various isotherm equations fig 6 as a general observation heating nre at 100 and 350 c had a positive impact on fluoride loading capacity while heating at 800 c reduced fluoride loading table 4 and fig 6 the variation in fluoride loading capacity may attribute to the changes in surface area with the heat treatment this is in accordance with osei et al 84 which reported optimum fluoride sorption onto kaolinite and goethite containing soil when heat treated at 400 c the langmuir vageler isotherm profiles for the heated nre samples confirmed that the test conditions were suitable to ensure a complete equilibrium profile 58 91 92 use of an appropriate driving force is crucial in determining qmax and avoiding data fitting errors 67 92 the shape of the isotherm profile was distinctly different for the as received nre sample the equilibrium data indicated that during the initial stage of fluoride loading the curve was favourable i e convex 93 at higher fluoride loadings a concave curve was recorded which was either typical of an unfavourable sorption process 93 or a sign of multilayer sorption of fluoride ions 58 in each case the aranovich donohue model was preferred to fit the experimental data as this equation can simulate more complex equilibrium curves the observed sum of errors was notably lower when using the aranovich donohue model for as received nre 0 003 compared to 0 008 to 0 013 for alternate equilibrium isotherm equations heating of the nre to 100 and 350 c not only changed the shape of the equilibrium profile to a convex favourable isotherm but also significantly increased the fluoride loading fig 6 in terms of fitting the equilibrium data the langmuir model was deemed to be challenging as a plateau was not found in the equilibrium profile potentially causing over estimation of maximum fluoride uptake 67 the freundlich model was inherently better at fitting equilibrium profiles which do not show a plateau in the data 93 the magnitude of freundlich exponents of heat treated nre ranged between 1 01 and 2 42 which indicated the favourability of heat treated nre towards fluoride 94 previous studies also show the sorption of as v 95 ni 53 and sb iii 54 onto nre was best fitted with the freundlich model due to surface heterogeneity the impact of activation of nre with acid upon subsequent equilibrium profiles for fluoride uptake are shown in fig 7 langmuir vageler plots suggest that isotherm profiles may plateau when the ratio of fluoride ions to acid treated nre in initial solutions exceeded 0 1 meq g the q max values for fluoride equilibrium loading on hcl treated nre increased to 0 02 meq g when using 1 m acid langmuir model the freundlich isotherm was generally a slightly improved fit for fluoride uptake on acid modified nre as was the aranovich donohue model regardless of the model applied to the sorption data it was apparent that acid pre treatment of nre improved the fluoride equilibrium performance in order to reduce initial fluoride concentration of 10 mg l below who safe drinking water guideline values approximately 63 50 and 40 mg l of 0 01 m 0 1 m and 1 m acid treated nre respectively were required compared to nre as received 1 m acid treatment reduced the amount of nre required to obtain 90 fluoride loading from 10 mg l solution by two thirds 3 3 4 fluoride sorption mechanism on nre it was pertinent to examine whether an ion exchange or adsorption process was the mechanism for removal of fluoride ions from solution using nre consequently the quantity of anion species cl and so4 released into solution in comparison with the amount of fluoride ions loaded onto the nre sample was calculated fig 8 the amount of anions desorbed when fluoride was loaded on 350 c heat treated nre was similar to the amount of ions desorbed fig 8 a in contrast the amount of fluoride equivalents sorbed onto 1 m acid treated nre was considerablly higher than the amount of anions released fig 8 b this evidence indicates an ion exchange process probably occured when using heated nre samples to remove fluoride from solution whereas an adsorption process was the favoured means of removing fluoride from solution when using acid treated nre one fluoride sorption mechanism may be the exchange of surface oh groups aloh and feoh represented as soh with fluoride eq 11 88 96 10 soh f sf o h the major fluoride loading mechanism onto 1 m acid treated nre may be hydrogen bond formation between the protonated surface aloh and feoh sites represented as soh surface hydroxyl sites of the nre can undergo protonation during acid treatment eq 11 protonated hydroxyl sites form strong hydrogen bonds with fluoride ions in the solution reducing fluoride concentration eqs 12 13 11 soh h so h 2 12 so h 2 f so h 2 f 13 so h 2 f sf h 2 o the formation of hydrogen bonds between protonated sorbent surface and fluoride in the solution has also been reported by errais et al 97 who indicated that hydrogen bond formation with protonated kaolinite surface sites was the major fluoride sorption mechanism under acidic conditions therefore protonation of surface sites is probably responsible for the superior optimum fluoride loading capacity of acid treated nre compared to heat treated nre the degree of protonation depends on the strength of the acid used for the activation treatment of nre table 4 however high acid concentrations greater than 3 m can also reduce fluoride sorption capacity by dehydroxylation of the kaolinite 55 3 4 fluoride removal from simulated groundwater to determine the influence of competing anions such as chloride bicarbonate and sulphate on fluoride sorption simulated groundwater was prepared table 5 shows water quality data before and after treating simulated groundwater with 1 m acid treated nre the nre sorbent successfully removed fluoride below the who safe drinking water guidelines within 2 min of contact time however the loading of fluoride ions observed when treating simulated groundwater compared with sodium fluoride sodium chloride solutions was reduced from 0 02 mmol f per g nre to 0 09 mmol f per g nre one reason for this behaviour may be the higher ph of simulated groundwater which may favour sorption of hydroxyl ions instead of fluoride ions 34 35 a second reason for the reduced fluoride sorption may be the negative influence of bicarbonate ions due to their affinity towards clay minerals 25 34 98 albeit this situation may be an added advantage in terms of improving the palatability of hard water in the ckdu endemic regions of sri lanka 99 concentrations of nitrate and sulphate remained constant after the treatment as did the solution ph the constant ph may be at least partly attributed to the presence of a carbonate bicarbonate buffer in simulated groundwater 3 5 practical applications fluoride removal from groundwater in terms of practical use of the acid modified nre due to fine size of 63 μm grains a simple batch sorption process is preferred to a treatment column in a column system the presence of small particles will result in excessive backpressure due to the blockages within the column additionally a column promotes system complexity and is therefore undesirable for use by poor farmers in rural areas instead a basic water filter made of two water baskets can be used to treat fluoride rich groundwater fig 9 the water can be added to the uppermost bucket spiked with an adequate amount of modified nre and mixed well for 5 min before settling once the sorbent is settled water can be transferred to a second bucket in the bottom which contains a sand filter this type of user friendly filter should last for at least five years and cost approximately lkr 3100 table a 1 the approximate cost of 1 l of water treated with this filter below who guideline value is predicted to be lkr 0 50 compared to lkr 1 00 3 50 for ro treated water table a 2 treating 1 l of groundwater according to the sl guideline value costs additional lkr 0 34 this basic filter satisfies key criteria such as being low cost technically simple low maintenance minimal waste ca 6 kg of sludge per month per family and makes use of local waste materials the production of fluoride sorbent and two bucket filter will produce valuable job opportunities for individuals in the region where for example a medium scale factory can employ four trained workers to produce acid treated nre 4 conclusions this study confirmed the hypothesis that a novel low cost method for fluoride removal from groundwater in ckdu endemic regions in sri lanka can be obtained using locally sourced mining waste natural red earth a waste product is naturally heterogeneous in character with the main components identified as quartz clays and iron oxides smaller grain sizes contained relatively more clay than quartz because of weathering processes heat activation converted the kaolin component to metakaolin whereas acid treatment did not notably impact the bulk structure of nre activation of the nre was preferably achieved by pre treatment with 1 m hydrochloric acid solutions a strategy that protonated sites on the nre surface which promoted adsorption of fluoride ions the exchange kinetics of fluoride ions with nre were relatively fast 5 min and this behaviour was ascribed to the fact this material comprises a coating wherein the active sorption sites were located equilibrium studies demonstrated that both thermal activation and acid activation increased the equilibrium loading of fluoride ions although the loadings were not high in comparison to commercial materials such as activated alumina nre was available locally in sri lanka cheaper and simple to use mechanistically heat treated nre appeared to remove fluoride ions using ion exchange in contrast acid activated nre operated by means of adsorption on protonated surface sites activated nre was ideal for use in a simple batch water treatment process a basic filter was created using two buckets coupled to a sand filter the sand filter may include other media such as charcoal to remove any organic matter in the water if required estimated capital costs appeared to be acceptable for deployment in rural farming communities in sri lanka although the volume of used nre was relatively small there remains potential to determine if this waste can be reused declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

mpda can effectively improve the specific surface area and active site defects of the dense pda coating combining magnetic nanoparticles with mpda can enhance the interaction between the adsorbent and the target while achieving rapid separation under external magnetic field conditions this point deserves our attention sio2 nanoparticles sio2 nps have received extensive attention due to their good thermal stability chemical stability sustainability and cost effectiveness 27 in the adsorption process surface modification is usually carried out such as amino functionalization carboxyl functionalization and thiol functionalization a large number of literature reports can prove that amino acids are the most widely used and most effective modification group and can have good adsorption effects on a variety of heavy metal ions 28 29 josé julio gutiérrez moreno et al 30 added an aptes modifier to sio2 to provide additional binding sites for the adsorption of heavy metal ion

particles am sio2 nps and prepared mpda functionalized magnetic microcapsule adsorbents fmnas fe3o4 is embedded in the mpda layer to impart magnetic properties to the material which is conducive to rapid magnetic separation of the adsorbent and the solution at the same time fe iii ions are successfully chelated with the hydroxyl groups on the surface of the mpda matrix through coordination which improves the chemical stability and mechanical strength of the composite material moreover fe iii mpda and am sio2 nps synergistically provide effective adsorption sites for special effects on pollutants the superparamagnetism mesoporous structure relatively large surface area and large number of active adsorption sites of fmnas increase the adsorption capacity 2 experiment 2 1 experimental

ltd all reagents were used without further purification 2 2 preparation of fmnas 2 2 1 preparation of magnetic fe3o4 nanoparticles a coprecipitation ultrasound assisted method was used to prepare magnetic fe3o4 nanoparticles first under the protection of ar fecl3 6h2o and feso4 7h2o were dissolved at a ratio of 2 1 in aqueous solution with the temperature set to 30 c subsequently nh3 h2o 25

water under the strong adsorption of an external magnetic field until the ph was neutral finally the sample was placed in a vacuum drying oven dried under vacuum and sealed for later use 2 2 2 preparation of mpda magnetic fe3o4 microcapsules mpda ms first a mixture of 150 ml of h2o and etoh volume ratio 1 1 was prepared then 1 g f127 and 1 8 ml tmb were added into the etoh h2o mixed system almost at the same time and the solution was ultrasonically assisted until it was completely dissolved then 1 m tris hcl buffer nh3 h2o to adjust the ph to 8 5 was added to the above mixed system 0 6 g of da and h2o was weighed to dissolve the mixture and the mixture was mechanically stirred until the reaction was complete after dispersing 1 5 g of magnetic fe3o4 nanoparticles in the above mixed solution it was stirred at room temperature for 24 h while attention was paid to the sealing of the mouth of the flask to prevent the evaporation of ethanol and a change in the polarity of the system the abovementioned reaction stock solution and acetone were mixed according to a volume ratio 5 2 and after ultrasonication for 15 min all the mixed solution was centrifuged after centrifugation the particles were dispersed in etoh solution for extraction treatment followed by three extractions ultrasonication for 30 min each time and centrifugation the magnetic adsorbent was quickly separated from the solution under the action of an external magnet finally it was dispersed in ethanol and dried for later use 2 2 3 preparation of layer by layer self assembled fmna microcapsules a total of 2 5 g of mpda ms was dispersed in the etoh aqueous solution with mechanical stirring and an ammonia aqueous solution was added to fully fuse after the system was stable for a short period of time 7 ml of teos solution was dissolved in the etoh solution and added dropwise to the above mixed solution the dropping rate was controlled by a separatory funnel and the reaction temperature was set to 45 c after continuing the reaction for 12 h 1 5 ml of aptes was added dropwise and condensed and refluxed for 6 h under stirring finally the nanoparticles and the solvent were separated by a centrifuge etoh and deionized water were repeatedly washed three times and dried in a vacuum drying oven at 120 c for 24 h to remove residual moisture and fmna microcapsules were obtained 2 3 micro characterization scanning electron microscopy sem fei was used to fix the sample on the conductive adhesive and the surface morphology was observed after vacuum spraying with gold a fourier transform infrared spectrometer ft ir nicolet 380 thermal fisher scientific was used to detect the samples in the kbr particles to determine their synthetic functional groups 32 the crystal structure of the sample was analyzed by x ray diffraction xrd rigaku miniflex 600 and the structure of the material was analyzed by the change in the diffraction crystal peak 33 the scanning step was 0 02 and the scanning angle range was 10 80 the samples were placed in a dsc analyzer mettler toledo switzerland to study their thermal stability during the thermogravimetric analysis the temperature was gradually increased to 600 c at a heating rate of 10 c min 2 4 measurement of hysteresis loop and nitrogen isothermal absorption and desorption curve the magnetic properties m h curve of the sample were measured by a vibrating sample magnetometer ez11 vsm microsense at room temperature and the magnetic field measurement intensity was set to 25 000 oe 25 000 oe to intuitively understand the specific surface area and pore volume characteristics of mesoporous materials the pore size distribution pore volume and specific surface area were determined by the n2 adsorption desorption curve on a volume adsorption analyzer belsorp max ii 34 2 5 organic dyes and cd ii ions adsorption experiments to verify the adsorption performance of fmna microcapsules on organic dyes and heavy metal ions two organic dyes with different ph levels af mb and cd no3 2 were selected for determination the absorbance of dyes and heavy metal ions before and after adsorption was measured by uv vis shimadzu uv 2450 spectrophotometer so as to measure its adsorption capacity the maximum wavelengths of af mb and cd ii are 540 664 and 230 nm respectively during the determination af mb and cd ii at a concentration of 50 mg l were prepared as standard solutions the standard solutions of different qualities were diluted a fold and then the standard working curve was determined to study the effect of different ph values on anionic and cationic dyes and heavy metals 50 ml aqueous pollutant solution with an initial concentration of 50 mg l at different ph values was prepared and naoh and hno3 solutions 0 1 1 mol

adsorbent material was centrifuged and magnetically separated and the supernatant was filtered and measured the adsorption effect of anionic and cationic dyes and heavy metals at different times is as described above the ph of af and cd ii is 6 the ph of mb is 8 and the concentration of the supernatant is measured at 0 240 min to reduce the experimental error three sets of parallel experiments are carried out each time the adsorption amount qe and the removal rate r were calculated as shown in eqs 1 and 2 29 35 1 q e c 0 c e v m 2 r c 0 c e c 0 100 where c0 and ce are the initial concentration

experiment after the adsorption test was completed the material was filtered out by magnetic separation placed in 30 ml hcl solution at a concentration of 0 1 mol l eluted by ultrasonic vibration for 30 min soaked for 4 h rinsed with distilled water three times and magnetically separated and the adsorption experiment was repeated 5 times 3 results and analysis 3 1 synthesis mechanism of fmnas in the etoh h2o system tmb was selected as the mediator and the triblock polymer pluronic f127 template was added to form a stable emulsion droplet with tmb in the system on this basis tris buffer was introduced again fe3o4 was used as the substrate da was used as the reactant and polymerization and assembly started in the system da molecules were oxidized in buffer to form dopamine quinone undergo intramolecular cyclization and undergo intermolecular and intramolecular rearrangement to form pda fe iii was chelated with the hydroxyl groups on the surface of the pda substrate through coordination and the pda layer was deposited on the surface of the magnetic fe3o4 to form nanospheres in this process tmb could adjust the interface interaction between f127 and da to control the unique pluronic f127 tmb da nanoemulsion this promotes the highly uniform polymerization of nanospheres at the same time the π π stacking interaction between tmb and pda molecules led to the formation of mesopores finally acetone and etoh were used to remove the template to form mpda magnetic fe3o4 microcapsules there were a large number of highly active hydroxyl groups in the mpda structure which could be used as a secondary reaction platform to hydrogen bond with the hydrolysate of teos free silanol and aptes copolycondensation were continuously deposited and adsorbed on the surface of mesoporous microcapsules to form an amino modified nano sio2 layer and fmna microcapsules were finally obtained the specific synthesis process is shown in fig 1 3 2 microscopic morphology of fmnas the surface microstructure and morphology of fmnas were observed by sem and the results are shown in fig 2 fmnas present a uniform spherical structure with a relatively uniform dispersion with an average particle size of 5 2 μm the outer shell is composed of am sio2 nps and the inner core is composed of mpda coated magnetic fe3o4 nanoparticles by magnifying fig 2b and e it can be clearly seen that the surface of the microcapsules is rough and uneven showing intertwined pore like structures the loose and porous structure on the surface of the microcapsule is because the pda particles formed by the self polymerization of da will gradually enter the interior of the tmb and there is a π π stacking interaction between pda and tmb thereby forming the mpda structure it is better proven by sem that the porous structure of fmans can provide a relatively large surface area for a large number of active groups such as oh and nh2 and increase the number of active adsorption sites for adsorption thereby increasing the adsorption capacity 36 3 3 ft ir and xrd analysis of fmnas the functional group structure and crystallinity of fmnas were further analyzed by ft ir and xrd respectively as shown in fig 3 a and b the characteristic absorption peak of fe3o4 can be clearly observed in the curves of fmnas mpda ms and fe3o4 in fig 3 a among them the stretching vibration of the feo bond at 582 cm 1 has a strong absorption peak and the stretching vibration of the coo bond at 1622 cm 1 it may be that the co2 in the air mixed with h2o to produce a small amount of carbonate the absorption peak in the range of 3100 3600 cm 1 is not only free oh but also nh in the structures of mpda and am sio2 nps 37 with the synthesis of fmnas the absorption peak in this range becomes broad the absorption peaks at 1273 cm 1 and 1479 cm 1 correspond to co and cc bonds respectively which indicates that the mpda coating is formed on the surface of fe3o4 the obvious antisymmetric stretching vibration peak of siosi can also be observed at 1118 cm 1 which further illustrates the successful introduction of sio2 11 in fig 3 b the 2θ 30 1 35 5 43 2 53 5 57 2 62 7 of fe3o4 corresponds to the crystal planes 220 311 400 422 511 and 440 this corresponds to the trans spinel structure of fe3o4 with sharp diffraction peaks and no other miscellaneous peaks indicating that fe3o4 has high purity good crystallinity and a narrow particle size distribution because pda is an amorphous polymer it also exhibits the same trend of diffraction peaks as fe3o4 indicating that the synthesis of mpda did not change the crystal structure of the sample there are several small diffraction peaks in the range of 2θ 21 this is because the diffraction peaks of sio2 after amino modification are weakened and the arch shape becomes no longer obvious 31 3 4 thermal stability analysis of fmnas fig 4 reflects the thermal stability of fmans mpda ms and fe3o4 the reason for the mass loss of the three substances in the first stage approximately 50 c is the evaporation of residual organic groups and water in the sample in fig 4 b it can be observed that the decomposition peak of the second stage 205 c 400 c appears and the mass loss has increased by approximately 7 75 this is because the mpda shell decomposes and disappears during the heating process 25 in fig 4 c the peak of the second stage shifts to the right and the decomposition peak of the third stage appears at the same time this is due to the addition of the am sio2 np shell layer during the heating process as the temperature rises first the shell is thermally decomposed and cracked followed by decomposition of the mpda shell layer and finally decomposition of the fe3o4 core its mass loss has increased by approximately 12 87 but it still has a certain degree of thermal stability in the entire temperature program process the three substances belong to endothermic reactions 3 5 vsm analysis the magnetic saturation of the material is the key parameter for the realization of magnetic separation fig 5 shows that the magnetic fe3o4 nanoparticles and fmans have magnetic responsiveness under an external magnetic field and the magnetic saturation intensities are 70 44 emu g and 42 87 emu g respectively it can be seen from the data curve that the saturation magnetization of fmans is lower than that of magnetic fe3o4 nanoparticles which may be attributed to the embedding of mpda and am sio2 nps but the overall magnetic responsiveness of fmans is not affected it can be seen from the enlarged fig 5 b that when the magnetic moment of the external magnetic field is zero there is no hysteresis phenomenon which indicates that both the magnetic fe3o4 nanoparticles and fmans have superparamagnetism and have certain advantages in magnetic response 38 therefore it can be separated from the solution by means of an external magnetic field it can effectively increase the recovery rate of materials and reduce the cost of use 3 6 analysis of the nitrogen isothermal absorption and desorption curve fig 6 a shows the nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherm of fmans which belongs to the type ii isotherm 39 according to the curve trend in fig 6 a the curve can be divided into three areas low pressure p1 p p0 0 2 medium pressure p2 0 2 p p0 0 85 and high pressure p3 0 85 p p0 1 0 in the p1 area the adsorption and desorption curves are highly consistent and there is a single layer adsorption phenomenon in the p2 area the adsorption and desorption curves begin to separate but the gap is not obvious and there is a phenomenon of multilayer adsorption in the p3 region there are obvious hysteresis loops in the adsorption and desorption curves which indicates that the fman porous adsorbent has a capillary agglomeration system which is a typical adsorption behavior of mesoporous materials the pore size distribution psd of samples based on the barrett joyner and halenda bjh method is shown in fig 6 b calculated by the bjh method the specific surface area of fmans is 55 844 m2 g the total pore volume is 0 438 cm3 g and its pore size distribution tends to be approximately 17 22 å and 347 75 å the prepared fmans have a larger specific surface area and pore volume which provides more adsorption sites for pollutants 3 7 analysis of the adsorption performance of organic dyes and heavy metal ions 3 7 1 adsorption performance under different initial ph conditions fig 7 shows the adsorption performance of microcapsules for organic dyes and heavy metal ions under different initial ph conditions fig 7 a pollutants are af and mb fig 7 b pollutants are cd ii in an overly acidic environment due to the presence of a large amount of h the nh2 and catechol groups in mpda and am sio2 nps are protonated to nh3 and oh which inhibits the adsorption capacity of the microcapsules this leads to a low removal rate at low ph with the weakening of acidity the deprotonation gradually increases and the removal rate begins to rise in an acidic environment h competes with the cation mb at the adsorption site while in an alkaline environment oh and mb coadsorb and the amount of mb adsorption increases therefore neutral and partial alkali conditions are conducive to the adsorption of mb in a strong acid environment the nh2 group of the anion af is also prone to protonation which inhibits the dissociation of so3h in an alkaline environment oh and anionic af not only have a competitive adsorption effect on the adsorption site but also reduce the protonated amino group of am sio2 nps weakening the electrostatic attraction with so3h and reducing the adsorption rate therefore strong acid and alkaline conditions are not conducive to the adsorption of af in an acidic environment the presence of h causes protonation the electrostatic repulsion between the positively charged functional group and cd ii prevents cd ii from contacting and coordinating with the adsorbent resulting in low adsorption capacity as the ph value increases the removal rate of cd ii gradually increases this is due to the corresponding decrease in the h concentration and the decrease in the protonation of the functional group which in turn leads to an increase in the available binding sites in the functional group and therefore an increase in the adsorption capacity however when the ph exceeds 7 cd ii is gradually hydrolyzed and precipitates into cd oh 2 and a small amount of cdoh complex is formed which affects the adsorption and removal of cd ii therefore in the ph range of 6 the removal rate of cd ii was the highest similar results have been reported in other studies 3 7 2 adsorption kinetics fig 8 shows the adsorption kinetics of mb af and cd ii in the adsorption process of fmans it can be seen that with the extension of time the adsorption rate increases from rapid to equilibrium this is due to the rapid diffusion of fman mesoporous channels and high adsorption activity which can quickly remove contaminants mpda forms a synergistic interaction with af mb and cd ii through a large number of amino groups and catechol groups in its structure combined with target pollutants through multiple modes of action such as chelation hydrogen bonding electrostatic interaction and π π stacking 40 the electrostatic interaction between the amino group of am sio2 nps and the sulfate anion in acid fuchsin removes acid fuchsin from water cd ii is adsorbed on the inner and outer surfaces of fman materials to form stable metal o chelate bonds with oh and feo the n and nch3 on the mb hybrid form intermolecular hydrogen bonds with silanol and catechol groups to further explain the adsorption mechanism adsorption kinetics and isotherm fitting were carried out 3 7 3 adsorption fitting according to the relevant parameters of the model fitting in fig 9 and table 1 the r2 value of the pseudo second order kinetic model is higher this indicates that chemical adsorption is the main control in the adsorption process of fmans mb af and cd ii collide with the active sites of the functional groups of fmans chelating coordination and other reactions occur and the results are captured and adsorbed the theoretical adsorption capacities of mb af and cd ii after fitting are 49 86 44 45 41 99 mg g which are relatively close to the experimental test results comparing the two isotherm models the r2 value of the freundlich model and langmuir model exceeds 0 995 therefore the adsorption process conforms to both langmuir model and freundlich model in freundlich model the value of n in the model equation represents the difficulty of the adsorption process and the value range of n is 0 n 10 when n 1 it is conducive to adsorption n 1 it is conducive to linear adsorption and n 1 it is not conducive to adsorption it can be seen from table 1 that n 1 indicating that the adsorption process easily proceeds kf indicates the strength of the adsorption capacity and the larger kf is the stronger the adsorption capacity at the same time langmuir isotherm fitting proves that the adsorption process is controlled by chemical adsorption which is consistent with the conclusion of kinetic model fitting 9 therefore the fmans adsorption process is simultaneously influenced by two adsorption processes namely chemical adsorption and physical adsorption 3 8 recycling of fmnas recycling is one of the important criteria to measure the advantages of adsorbent materials fig 10 shows the removal efficiency of mb af and cd ii in 5 cycles the results show that with the increase in the number of cycles the removal efficiency of fmnas on mb and af is still above 95 and 80 and there is almost no excessive degradation of the adsorption performance the removal efficiency of cd ii by fmnas has a certain downward trend but the overall decrease is within 15 the decrease in chelating ability may be due to the loss of irreversibly bound metal or chelating agent overall it shows that fmnas have good reusability at the same time the comparison with other adsorbents is shown in table 2 which is only for reference due to different use conditions 4 conclusion in this study magnetic fe3o4 nanoparticles were used as the core to prepare mpda ms microcapsules by the template removal method which gave the microcapsules superparamagnetism and mesoporous structure finally sio2 nps were self installed on the surface of mpda ms fmna microcapsules were obtained to improve the adsorption performance efficiency and selectivity of new materials analyzing the fmna microcapsules the following important results were obtained 1 microscopic mechanism analysis fe iii chelates with the hydroxyl groups on the surface of the pda matrix through coordination the π π stacking

surface of mesoporous microcapsules to form an amino modified nano sio2 layer 2 the functional group structure was further analyzed by ft ir and xrd which confirmed the successful synthesis of fmnas tg dtg dsc analysis showed that the decomposition of fmans is an endothermic reaction and has certain thermal stability 3 vsm analysis proves that fmans have superparamagnetism which can effectively improve the recovery rate of materials and still has a high removal efficiency under 5 cycles the analysis of the nitrogen isothermal adsorption and desorption curve shows that fmans belong to type iv isotherms the specific surface area of fmans is 55 844 m2 g and the total pore volume is 0 438 cm3 g calculated by the bjh method the largest pore size distribution tends to be concentrated at 17 22 å and approximately 347 75 å 4 the adsorption performance of fmans on mb af and cd ii under the optimal initial ph conditions was obtained adsorption kinetics and isotherm fitting are obtained the

12941,to scientifically and effectively solve the environmental and human hazards of polluted water bodies this study uses the superparamagnetism of fe3o4 the biocompatibility of mussel biomimetic polydopamine and the large specific surface area and pore volume of mesoporous materials layer by layer self assembled amino functionalized modified nano sio2 particles were used to prepare mesoporous

area 55 844m2 g and pore volume 0 438 cm3 g in the mesoporous structure of fmnas provide a large number of active adsorption sites and exhibit high adsorption capacity for mb af and cd ii which are 42 35 46 20 and 40 70 mg g respectively the adsorption process of fmans is mainly controlled by chemical adsorption which conforms to langmuir and freundlich isothermal model superparamagnetism gives fmnas good repeatability graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords magnetic fe3o4 polydopamine nano sio2 adsorption multifunctional material 1 introduction with the rapid development of industrialization and urbanization heavy metals pesticides dyes antibiotics and other toxic and harmful substances in wastewater discharge have entered the ecosystem in large quantities their toxicity and nondegradability characteristics have caused continuous pollution to the environment it also endangers human health 1 2 therefore scientific and effective solutions to the environmental and human hazards of polluted water bodies cannot be ignored the use of water treatment technology to remove various pollutants in wastewater has important practical significance 3 4 traditional water treatment methods mainly include the redox method chemical precipitation method ion exchange method membrane separation method etc in the actual application process there are cumbersome operations time consuming high cost poor selectivity and easy to produce secondary pollution and other issues 5 6 the adsorption method has received recognition and attention from scientific researchers due to its simplicity high efficiency low cost and environmental friendliness 7 9 however the current research and development of adsorbent materials still have disadvantages such as low adsorption capacity and difficulty in regeneration which limit their application in polluted wastewater treatment to achieve sustainable development research on high efficiency recyclable and green new adsorption materials has become the focus of this research magnetic nanoadsorbent materials have good application effects in the water treatment process and have attracted the attention of scientific researchers fe3o4 has become the most common material of choice for magnetic nanoparticles due to its high magnetic saturation easy surface modification simple synthesis method high chemical stability good safety and superparamagnetism 10 11 e i nosike et al 12 used the carboxyl functional group on the surface of polyacrylic acid to modify fe3o4 and embed it in zif 90 then through the schiff base reaction the core

zif 8 the material has high active sites specific surface area and ordered microporous structure and has high adsorption capacity for heavy metal element uranium and rapid adsorption equilibrium time in short the modified magnetic fe3o4 has abundant adsorption active sites and a high specific surface area 14 it can achieve efficient adsorption through various interaction such as coordination electrostatic interaction hydrogen bonding and π π conjugation effectively improving the defects of insufficient surface functional groups at the same time it has a good recycling capacity and great application prospects in the treatment of polluted wastewater the core shell structure of microcapsules can coat magnetic nanomaterials with other organic or inorganic materials it is a new type of nanocomposite material with excellent comprehensive performance 15 17 magnetic nanocapsules can exert the unique volume effect surface effect and quantum tunneling effects of nanoparticles and can also exert the performance of magnetic particles inside the core to achieve rapid separation 18 20 at the same time choosing suitable organic inorganic materials for coating can enrich the surface groups and effectively expand the active adsorption sites polydopamine pda has the advantages of simple synthesis rich functional groups and high biocompatibility it can self polymerize on the surface of organic and inorganic materials to form a highly adhesive coating layer 21 22 when acting as an adsorbent it can be combined with target pollutants through multiple modes of action such as chelation hydrogen bonding electrostatic interaction and π π accumulation 23 25 chen et al 23 prepared an environmentally friendly polydopamine composite adsorbent cd ca pda based on a cyclodextrin polymer for the removal of cationic dyes and metals which combines the advantages of cyclodextrin and polydopamine it can be recycled and reused 5 times and has great potential in the field of wastewater treatment beyhan erdem et al 26 prepared a multifunctional magnetic mesoporous nanocomposite fe3o4 pda sba 15 vtes for the adsorption of dyes and oils the adsorbent has a high adsorption capacity which can reach 8 83 times its own weight in addition it can be recycled through a simple washing and drying process the high specific surface area and porosity of mesoporous polydopamine mpda can effectively improve the specific surface area and active site defects of the dense pda coating combining magnetic nanoparticles with mpda can enhance the interaction between the adsorbent and the target while achieving rapid separation under external magnetic field conditions this point deserves our attention sio2 nanoparticles sio2 nps have received extensive attention due to their good thermal stability chemical stability sustainability and cost effectiveness 27 in the adsorption process surface modification is usually carried out such as amino functionalization carboxyl functionalization and thiol functionalization a large number of literature reports can prove that amino acids are the most widely used and most effective modification group and can have good adsorption effects on a variety of heavy metal ions 28 29 josé julio gutiérrez moreno et al 30 added an aptes modifier to sio2 to provide additional binding sites for the adsorption of heavy metal ion pollutants which can increase the adsorption strength of heavy metal protons saleem raza et al 31 grafted biobased hydrolyzed hollow particles bhhps with amino modified sio2 nps to obtain sio2 bhhps at ph 2 the maximum adsorption capacity for methyl orange dye and bisphenol a reached 701 and 411 mg g respectively therefore this study can choose to combine magnetic fe3o4 and mpda on the basis of 3 aminopropyltriethoxysilane aptes modified sio2 nps to improve the adsorption performance efficiency and selectivity of new materials in summary this study uses the superparamagnetism of fe3o4 the biocompatibility of mussel biomimetic pda the large specific surface area and pore volume of the mesoporous material as the core layers of self assembled amino functionalized modified nano sio2 particles am sio2 nps and prepared mpda functionalized magnetic microcapsule adsorbents fmnas fe3o4 is embedded in the mpda layer to impart magnetic properties to the material which is conducive to rapid magnetic separation of the adsorbent and the solution at the same time fe iii ions are successfully chelated with the hydroxyl groups on the surface of the mpda matrix through coordination which improves the chemical stability and mechanical strength of the composite material moreover fe iii mpda and am sio2 nps synergistically provide effective adsorption sites for special effects on pollutants the superparamagnetism mesoporous structure relatively large surface area and large number of active adsorption sites of fmnas increase the adsorption capacity 2 experiment 2 1 experimental

preparation of mpda magnetic fe3o4 microcapsules mpda ms first a mixture of 150 ml of h2o and etoh volume ratio 1 1 was prepared then 1 g f127 and 1 8 ml tmb were added into the etoh h2o mixed system almost at the same time and the solution was ultrasonically assisted until it was completely dissolved then 1 m tris hcl buffer nh3 h2o to adjust the ph to 8 5 was added to the above mixed system 0 6 g of da and h2o was weighed to dissolve the mixture and the mixture was mechanically stirred until the reaction was complete after dispersing 1 5 g of magnetic fe3o4 nanoparticles in the above mixed solution it was stirred at room temperature for 24 h while attention was paid to the sealing of the mouth of the flask to prevent the evaporation of ethanol and a change in the polarity of the system

etoh and deionized water were repeatedly washed three times and dried in a vacuum drying oven at 120 c for 24 h to remove residual moisture and fmna microcapsules were obtained 2 3 micro characterization scanning electron microscopy sem fei was used to fix the sample on the conductive adhesive and the surface morphology was observed after vacuum spraying with gold a fourier transform infrared spectrometer ft ir nicolet 380 thermal fisher scientific was used to detect the samples in the kbr particles to determine their synthetic functional groups 32 the crystal structure of the sample was analyzed by x ray diffraction xrd rigaku miniflex 600 and the structure of the material was analyzed by the change in the diffraction crystal peak 33 the scanning step was 0 02 and the scanning angle range was 10 80 the samples were placed in a dsc analyzer mettler toledo switzerland to study their thermal stability during the thermogravimetric analysis the temperature was gradually

surface area and pore volume characteristics of mesoporous materials the pore size distribution pore volume and specific surface area were determined by the n2 adsorption desorption curve on a volume adsorption analyzer belsorp max ii 34 2 5 organic dyes and cd ii ions adsorption experiments to verify the adsorption performance of fmna microcapsules on organic dyes and heavy metal ions two organic dyes with different ph levels af mb and cd no3 2 were selected for determination the absorbance of dyes and heavy metal ions before and after adsorption was measured by uv vis shimadzu uv 2450 spectrophotometer so as to measure its adsorption capacity the maximum wavelengths of af mb and cd ii are 540 664 and 230 nm respectively during the determination af mb and cd ii at a concentration of 50 mg l were prepared as standard solutions the standard solutions of different qualities were diluted a fold and then the standard working curve was determined to study the effect of different ph values on anionic and cationic dyes and heavy metals 50 ml aqueous pollutant solution with an initial concentration of 50 mg l at different ph values was prepared and naoh and hno3 solutions 0 1 1 mol

adsorbent material was centrifuged and magnetically separated and the supernatant was filtered and measured the adsorption effect of anionic and cationic dyes and heavy metals at different times is as described above the ph of af and cd ii is 6 the ph of mb is 8 and the concentration of the supernatant is measured at 0 240 min to reduce the experimental error three sets of parallel experiments are carried out each time the adsorption amount qe and the removal rate r were calculated as shown in eqs 1 and 2 29 35 1 q e c 0 c e v m 2 r c 0 c e c 0 100 where c0 and ce are the initial concentration

experiment after the adsorption test was completed the material was filtered out by magnetic separation placed in 30 ml hcl solution at a concentration of 0 1 mol l eluted by ultrasonic vibration for 30 min soaked for 4 h rinsed with distilled water three times and magnetically separated and the adsorption experiment was repeated 5 times 3 results and analysis 3 1 synthesis mechanism of fmnas in the etoh h2o system tmb was selected as the mediator and the triblock polymer pluronic f127 template was added to form a stable emulsion droplet with tmb in the system on this basis tris buffer was introduced again fe3o4 was used as the substrate da was used as the reactant and polymerization and assembly started in the system da molecules were oxidized in buffer to form dopamine quinone undergo intramolecular cyclization and undergo intermolecular and intramolecular rearrangement to form pda fe iii was chelated with the hydroxyl groups on the surface of the pda substrate through coordination and the pda layer was deposited on the surface of the magnetic fe3o4 to form nanospheres in this process tmb could adjust the interface interaction between f127 and da to control the unique pluronic f127 tmb da nanoemulsion this promotes the highly uniform polymerization of nanospheres at the same time the π π stacking interaction between tmb and pda molecules led to the formation of mesopores finally acetone and etoh were used to remove the template to form mpda magnetic fe3o4 microcapsules there were a large number of highly active hydroxyl groups in the mpda structure which could be used as a secondary reaction platform to hydrogen bond with the hydrolysate of teos free silanol and aptes copolycondensation were continuously deposited and adsorbed on the surface of mesoporous microcapsules to form an amino modified nano sio2 layer and fmna microcapsules were finally obtained the specific synthesis process is shown in fig 1 3 2 microscopic morphology of fmnas the surface microstructure and morphology of fmnas were observed by sem and the results are shown in fig 2 fmnas present a uniform spherical structure with a relatively uniform dispersion with an average particle size of 5 2 μm the outer shell is composed of am sio2 nps and the inner core is composed of mpda coated magnetic fe3o4 nanoparticles by magnifying fig 2b and e it can be clearly seen that the surface of the microcapsules is rough and uneven showing intertwined pore like structures the loose and porous structure on the surface of the microcapsule is because the pda particles formed by the self polymerization of da will gradually enter the interior of the tmb and there is a π π stacking interaction between pda and tmb thereby forming the mpda structure it is better proven by sem that the porous structure of fmans can provide a relatively large surface area for a large number of active groups such as oh and nh2 and increase the number of active adsorption sites for adsorption thereby increasing the adsorption capacity 36 3 3 ft ir and xrd analysis of fmnas the functional group structure and crystallinity of fmnas were further analyzed by ft ir and xrd respectively as shown in fig 3 a and b the characteristic absorption peak of fe3o4 can be clearly observed in the curves of fmnas mpda ms and fe3o4 in fig 3 a among them the stretching vibration of the feo bond at 582 cm 1 has a strong absorption peak and the stretching vibration of the coo bond at 1622 cm 1 it may be that the co2 in the air mixed with h2o to produce a small amount of carbonate the absorption peak in the range of 3100 3600 cm 1 is not only free oh but also nh in the structures of mpda and am sio2 nps 37 with the synthesis of fmnas the absorption peak in this range becomes broad the absorption peaks at 1273 cm 1 and 1479 cm 1 correspond to co and cc bonds respectively which indicates that the mpda coating is formed on the surface of fe3o4 the obvious antisymmetric stretching vibration peak of siosi can also be observed at 1118 cm 1 which further illustrates the successful introduction of sio2 11 in fig 3 b the 2θ 30 1 35 5 43 2 53 5 57 2 62 7 of fe3o4 corresponds to the crystal planes 220 311 400 422 511 and 440 this corresponds to the trans spinel structure of fe3o4 with sharp diffraction peaks and no other miscellaneous peaks indicating that fe3o4 has high purity good crystallinity and a narrow particle size distribution because pda is an amorphous polymer it also exhibits the same trend of diffraction peaks as fe3o4 indicating that the synthesis of mpda did not change the crystal structure of the sample there are several small diffraction peaks in the range of 2θ 21 this is because the diffraction peaks of sio2 after amino modification are weakened and the arch shape becomes no longer obvious 31 3 4 thermal stability analysis of fmnas fig 4 reflects the thermal stability of fmans mpda ms and fe3o4 the reason for the mass loss of the three substances in the first stage approximately 50 c is the evaporation of residual organic groups and water in the sample in fig 4 b it can be observed that the decomposition peak of the second stage 205 c 400 c appears and the mass loss has increased by approximately 7 75 this is because the mpda shell decomposes and disappears during the heating process 25 in fig 4 c the peak of the second stage shifts to the right and the decomposition peak of the third stage appears at the same time this is due to the addition of the am sio2 np shell layer during the heating process as the temperature rises first the shell is thermally decomposed and cracked followed by decomposition of the mpda shell layer and finally decomposition of the fe3o4 core its mass loss has increased by approximately 12 87 but it still has a certain degree of thermal stability in the entire temperature program process the three substances belong to endothermic reactions 3 5 vsm analysis the magnetic saturation of the material is the key parameter for the realization of magnetic separation fig 5 shows that the magnetic fe3o4 nanoparticles and fmans have magnetic responsiveness under an external magnetic field and the magnetic saturation intensities are 70 44 emu g and 42 87 emu g respectively it can be seen from the data curve that the saturation magnetization of fmans is lower than that of magnetic fe3o4 nanoparticles which may be attributed to the embedding of mpda and am sio2 nps but the overall magnetic responsiveness of fmans is not affected it can be seen from the enlarged fig 5 b that when the magnetic moment of the external magnetic field is zero there is no hysteresis phenomenon which indicates that both the magnetic fe3o4 nanoparticles and fmans have superparamagnetism and have certain advantages in magnetic response 38 therefore it can be separated from the solution by means of an external magnetic field it can effectively increase the recovery rate of materials and reduce the cost of use 3 6 analysis of the nitrogen isothermal absorption and desorption curve fig 6 a shows the nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherm of fmans which belongs to the type ii isotherm 39 according to the curve trend in fig 6 a the curve can be divided into three areas low pressure p1 p p0 0 2 medium pressure p2 0 2 p p0 0 85 and high pressure p3 0 85 p p0 1 0 in the p1 area the adsorption and desorption curves are highly consistent and there is a single layer adsorption phenomenon in the p2 area the adsorption and desorption curves begin to separate but the gap is not obvious and there is a phenomenon of multilayer adsorption in the p3 region there are obvious hysteresis loops in the adsorption and desorption curves which indicates that the fman porous adsorbent has a capillary agglomeration system which is a typical adsorption behavior of mesoporous materials the pore size distribution psd of samples based on the barrett joyner and halenda bjh method is shown in fig 6 b calculated by the bjh method the specific surface area of fmans is 55 844 m2 g the total pore volume is 0 438 cm3 g and its pore size distribution tends to be approximately 17 22 å and 347 75 å the prepared fmans have a larger specific surface area and pore volume which provides more adsorption sites for pollutants 3 7 analysis of the adsorption performance of organic dyes and heavy metal ions 3 7 1 adsorption performance under different initial ph conditions fig 7 shows the adsorption performance of microcapsules for organic dyes and heavy metal ions under different initial ph conditions fig 7 a pollutants are af and mb fig 7 b pollutants are cd ii in an overly acidic environment due to the presence of a large amount of h the nh2 and catechol groups in mpda and am sio2 nps are protonated to nh3 and oh which inhibits the adsorption capacity of the microcapsules this leads to a low removal rate at low ph with the weakening of acidity the deprotonation gradually increases and the removal rate begins to rise in an acidic environment h competes with the cation mb at the adsorption site while in an alkaline environment oh and mb coadsorb and the amount of mb adsorption increases therefore neutral and partial alkali conditions are conducive to the adsorption of mb in a strong acid environment the nh2 group of the anion af is also prone to protonation which inhibits the dissociation of so3h in an alkaline environment oh and anionic af not only have a competitive adsorption effect on the adsorption site but also reduce the protonated amino group of am sio2 nps weakening the electrostatic attraction with so3h and reducing the adsorption rate therefore strong acid and alkaline conditions are not conducive to the adsorption of af in an acidic environment the presence of h causes protonation the electrostatic repulsion between the positively charged functional group and cd ii prevents cd ii from contacting and coordinating with the adsorbent resulting in low adsorption capacity as the ph value increases the removal rate of cd ii gradually increases this is due to the corresponding decrease in the h concentration and the decrease in the protonation of the functional group which in turn leads to an increase in the available binding sites in the functional group and therefore an increase in the adsorption capacity however when the ph exceeds 7 cd ii is gradually hydrolyzed and precipitates into cd oh 2 and a small amount of cdoh complex is formed which affects the adsorption and removal of cd ii therefore in the ph range of 6 the removal rate of cd ii was the highest similar results have been reported in other studies 3 7 2 adsorption kinetics fig 8 shows the adsorption kinetics of mb af and cd ii in the adsorption process of fmans it can be seen that with the extension of time the adsorption rate increases from rapid to equilibrium this is due to the rapid diffusion of fman mesoporous channels and high adsorption activity which can quickly remove contaminants mpda forms a synergistic interaction with af mb and cd ii through a large number of amino groups and catechol groups in its structure combined with target pollutants through multiple modes of action such as chelation hydrogen bonding electrostatic interaction and π π stacking 40 the electrostatic interaction between the amino group of am sio2 nps and the sulfate anion in acid fuchsin removes acid fuchsin from water cd ii is adsorbed on the inner and outer surfaces of fman materials to form stable metal o chelate bonds with oh and feo the n and nch3 on the mb hybrid form intermolecular hydrogen bonds with silanol and catechol groups to further explain the adsorption mechanism adsorption kinetics and isotherm fitting were carried out 3 7 3 adsorption fitting according to the relevant parameters of the model fitting in fig 9 and table 1 the r2 value of the pseudo second order kinetic model is higher this indicates that chemical adsorption is the main control in the adsorption process of fmans mb af and cd ii collide with the active sites of the functional groups of fmans chelating coordination and other reactions occur and the results are captured and adsorbed the theoretical adsorption capacities of mb af and cd ii after fitting are 49 86 44 45 41 99 mg g which are relatively close to the experimental test results comparing the two isotherm models the r2 value of the freundlich model and langmuir model exceeds 0 995 therefore the adsorption process conforms to both langmuir model and freundlich model in freundlich model the value of n in the model equation represents the difficulty of the adsorption process and the value range of n is 0 n 10 when n 1 it is conducive to adsorption n 1 it is conducive to linear adsorption and n 1 it is not conducive to adsorption it can be seen from table 1 that n 1 indicating that the adsorption process easily proceeds kf indicates the strength of the adsorption capacity and the larger kf is the stronger the adsorption capacity at the same time langmuir isotherm fitting proves that the adsorption process is controlled by chemical adsorption which is consistent with the conclusion of kinetic model fitting 9 therefore the fmans adsorption process is simultaneously influenced by two adsorption processes namely chemical adsorption and physical adsorption 3 8 recycling of fmnas recycling is one of the important criteria to measure the advantages of adsorbent materials fig 10 shows the removal efficiency of mb af and cd ii in 5 cycles the results show that with the increase in the number of cycles the removal efficiency of fmnas on mb and af is still above 95 and 80 and there is almost no excessive degradation of the adsorption performance the removal efficiency of cd ii by fmnas has a certain downward trend but the overall decrease is within 15 the decrease in chelating ability may be due to the loss of irreversibly bound metal or chelating agent overall it shows that fmnas have good reusability at the same time the comparison with other adsorbents is shown in table 2 which is only for reference due to different use conditions 4 conclusion in this study magnetic fe3o4 nanoparticles were used as the core to prepare mpda ms microcapsules by the template removal method which gave the microcapsules superparamagnetism and mesoporous structure finally sio2 nps were self installed on the surface of mpda ms fmna microcapsules were obtained to improve the adsorption performance efficiency and selectivity of new materials analyzing the fmna microcapsules the following important results were obtained 1 microscopic mechanism analysis fe iii chelates with the hydroxyl groups on the surface of the pda matrix through coordination the π π stacking interaction between tmb and pda molecules leads to the formation of mesopores mpda is used as a secondary reaction platform and free silanol and aptes cocondensation deposition is adsorbed on the surface of mesoporous microcapsules to form an amino modified nano sio2 layer 2 the functional group structure was further analyzed by ft ir and xrd which confirmed the successful synthesis of fmnas tg dtg dsc analysis showed that the decomposition of fmans is an endothermic reaction and has certain thermal stability 3 vsm analysis proves that fmans have superparamagnetism which can effectively improve the recovery rate of materials and still has a high removal efficiency under 5 cycles the analysis of the nitrogen isothermal adsorption and desorption curve shows that fmans belong to type iv isotherms the specific surface area of fmans is 55 844 m2 g and the total pore volume is 0 438 cm3 g calculated by the bjh method the largest pore size distribution tends to be concentrated at 17 22 å and approximately 347 75 å 4 the adsorption performance of fmans on mb af and cd ii under the optimal initial ph conditions was obtained adsorption kinetics and isotherm fitting are obtained the adsorption process of fmans is mainly controlled by chemical adsorption which conforms to langmuir and freundlich isothermal model declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

norfloxacin has been widely used for the treatment of pneumonia skin infections genitourinary and upper respiratory tract infections 1 2 ofloxacin is considered an important pollutant in ecological environment 3 5 the concentration of ofloxacin reaches to 5100 ng l 1 in bohai bay 6 and even to 13 633 ng l 1 in taiwan area of china 7 though biological treatment is environment friendly and cost effective it is not effective due to its high chemical stability and its abroad spectrum of antimicrobial activity 8 10 advanced oxidation processes aops have shown a good application prospect in the treatment of ofloxacin wastewater 11 14 among aops electro fenton technology shows many advantages such as energy saving and safety 15 h2o2 and hydroxyl radical oh are produced by aeration on the cathode in electro fenton process 16 and oh attacks pollutants without selectivity because of its high oxidation potential however the existence time of oh in water is very short generally 3 5 ms in order to improve the utilization rate of oh and to further promote the degradation efficiency of ofloxacin concentrating ofloxacin near the cathode and increasing the contact probability of ofloxacin and oh have become a key problem in electro fenton system 17 18 suitable cathode material used as working electrode is a critical factor in electro fenton process compared with other electrodes carbon felt electrode has the advantages of high stability low cost variable shape and high catalytic activity 19 a box made up of carbon felt was adopted as cathode in this study clinoptilolite are natural crystalline materials with a framework of sio4 and alo4 linked together by oxygen atoms clinoptilolite an effective adsorbent for ofloxacin was chosen from many adsorbents because of its high chemical

clinoptilolite added in the cathode box ccea ef reactor c is the clinoptilolite carbon felt electro fenton system with internal aeration and clinoptilolite in the carbon felt box ccia ef as seen in fig 1 in the cathode carbon felt box of reactor b and c 20 g clinoptilolite was added respectively the net distance between the electrodes was 3 cm the applied dc voltage was 2 0 v and the experimental temperature was maintained at 20 2 c ofloxacin 99 0 chemically pure was bought from alfa aesar usa experimental water was prepared using tap water 400 80 μs cm 1 the concentration of ofloxacin was 25 mg l 1 no other electrolyte except fecl2 of 200 mg l 1 was added and ph was adjusted to 3 by adding 0 1 mol l 1 h2so4 the reactors were operated in sequential batch mode 2 2 analytical equipment and methods voltage was supplied by using an electrochemical workstation chi600e shanghai huachen instruments co ltd china concentrations of ofloxacin and intermediate products were determined by using hplc u3000 thermo scientific usa micr otof q ii flight mass spectrometry german bruker company hplc was equipped with a c18 column 3 μm 3 0 mm i d 100 mm and a diode array detector wavelength at 288 nm the analytical conditions were as follows the mobile phase was 15 acetonitrile 1 phosphoric acid and 84 water with a flow rate of 0 3 ml min 1 the conditions of mass

spectrophotometer uv795 shanghai instrument analysis co ltd china the fe2 content was monitored by spectrophotometric method at 510 nm via its complex with phenanhroline and then added hydroxylamine

efficiency η of ofloxacin and toc is calculated as 1 η c o c t c o 100 where co and ct mg l 1 are the initial concentration and the concentration at reaction time t respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorption of ofloxacin on clinoptilolite clinoptilolite used in this experiment was purchased from liaoning kangda zeolite mining co ltd liaoning province china the main chemical compositions of clinoptilolite are 68 60 sio2 9 33 al2o3 and alkaline earth metal ions the diameter of clinoptilolite particle is between 0 5 and 1 mm the porosity is 59 2 62 1 the specific surface area is 573 616 m2 g 1 and the mean pore diameter is 4 å the xrd pattern of the original clinoptilolite was provided in fig s1 the 20 g clinoptilolite was added in 1 l experimental water of ph 3 the experiment was performed under ofloxacin initial concentration of 25 mg l 1 at 20 2 c in an organic glass reactor with a magnetic stirrer the adsorption equilibrium time was only 90 min and the equilibrium concentration was 2 26 mg l 1 fig 2 the adsorption capacity of ofloxacin was calculated to be 1 12 mg g 1 the absorption capacity of ofloxacin on clinoptilolite is obviously better than chitosan biochar and calcined bentonite clay for ofloxacin 20 21 23 24 but lower than activated carbon and zif 8 25 26 the stability recycling and low price of zeolite make it become a promising adsorbent and this experiment showed that the porous clinoptilolite with special skeleton structure had strong adsorption for ofloxacin based on the experimental result we designed an adsorption electro fenton reactor to improve the utilization rate of oh in order to achieve efficient degradation of ofloxacin 3 2 ofloxacin degradation in the three systems in order to study the effects of clinoptilolite addition and different aerator position on ofloxacin degradation the three reactors were operated in parallel under the conditions of the initial ofloxacin concentration of 25 mg l 1 voltage of 2 0 v fecl2 of 200 mg l 1 as catalyst and ph value of around 3 the degradation efficiencies of ofloxacin and toc with the reaction time in the three systems were shown as fig 3 the used clinoptilolite was replaced with new clinoptilolite before the next experiment was begun the degradation efficiencies of ofloxacin and toc were different in cea ef ccea ef and ccia ef fig 3 as shown in fig 3a the degradation rate of ofloxacin in the ccia ef was the fastest the concentration of ofloxacin reduced from 25 0 3 to 2 7 0 6 mg l 1 in 45 min the concentration of ofloxacin decreased below the detection limit and the removal rate of toc was 82 7 3 1 at 105 min fig 3b the concentration of ofloxacin in the ccea ef decreased to 4 4 0 5 mg l 1 with the degradation efficiency of 82 4 0 4 and the toc removal rate was 58 6 2 6 at 105 min in the cea ef the degradation efficiency of ofloxacin was only 34 8 0 4 and the toc removal rate was only 11 3 1 1 at 105 min the degradation efficiency of ofloxacin in the cea ef was much slower than the other two systems clinoptilolite addition and aerator position have a great influence on the degradation of ofloxacin the experimental data all followed the first order kinetics model with the correlation coefficients r of greater than 0 95 in all three reactors fig s2 the degradation rate constant k is 0 0501 0 0178 and 0 0044 min 1 in the ccia ef ccea ef and cea ef respectively the reaction rate constant 0 0178 min 1 in the ccea ef was 4 05 times of that in the cea ef 0 0044 min 1 showing that the ofloxacin enrichment by clinoptilolite adsorption is very important in oh oxidation of ofloxacin the reaction rate constant 0 0501 min 1 in the ccia ef was 2 81 times of that in ccea ef and 11 4 times of that in the cea ef compared with the ccea ef internal aeration has a significant impact on ofloxacin degradation 27 in electro fenton reactor the generation process of oh is 1 the dissolved oxygen supplied by aerator is reduced to generate h2o2 on the carbon felt cathode eq 2 2 h2o2 reacts with fe2 catalyst to form oh and fe3 in the acidic environment at ph of about 3 in the reactor eq 3 and 3 the resulting fe3 can be reduced to form fe2 on the cathode eq 4 realizing the regeneration of fe2 catalyst and guaranteeing the continuous generation of oh 28 2 o 2 2 h 2 e h 2 o 2 3 fe 2 h 2 o 2 fe 3 oh oh 4 fe 3 e fe 2 in the ccia ef during the degradation of ofloxacin the concentration of fe2 fe3 h2o2 and oh in the carbon felt box were measured and shown in fig 4 the concentration of fe2 decreased significantly within 15 min and then it was relatively stable at 39 4 3 3 mg l 1 the concentration of fe3 rose rapidly to 48 1 mg l 1 in 15 min and then the ratio of fe2 fe3 kept approximately 0 9 concentration of oh increased slowly and in the meanwhile the concentration of ofloxacin decreased from 25 0 3 to 2 7 0 6 mg l 1 in the initial 45 min which were consistent with high consumption of oh for the ofloxacin degradation h2o2 was simultaneously maintained at a low concentration due to the high catalytic activity of fe2 27 29 according to the above experimental data the probable mechanism of effective ofloxacin degradation by the adsorption electro fenton with green self regeneration function in ccia ef was as following as shown in fig 5 firstly oh is generated inside clinoptilolite carbon felt box used as the cathode and diffuses outward the oh movement is in the opposite direction to the ofloxacin adsorption and enrichment to clinoptilolite which increases the collision chance between oh and ofloxacin molecules 14 that effectively improves the utilization rate of oh secondly the suitable air flow generated by the aerator inside the carbon felt box can suspend the clinoptilolite particles and greatly improves mass transfer in the ccia ef finally ofloxacin adsorbed on clinoptilolite is removed by oh oxidation realizing the green self regeneration of clinoptilolite thus the adsorption and enrichment of ofloxacin onto clinoptilolite are continuously performed 3 3 performance of multi cycle operation in order to investigate the stability in long term operation the experiment was carried out many cycles under the condition identical as section 3 2 except that the same clinoptilolite in the carbon felt box was used all the time in multi cycle operation the removal efficiencies of ofloxacin in the ccia ef for 10 cycles and in the ccea ef for 5 cycles were presented in fig 6 in 10 cycles the degradation efficiency of ofloxacin could reach to 100 at 105 min in the ccia ef showing that the degradation performance was not weakened at all however in the ccea ef the degradation efficiency of ofloxacin decreased gradually with the increase of cycle at the first and fifth cycle the concentration of residual ofloxacin is 4 4 mg l 1 and 13 7 mg l 1 at 105 min respectively that is because ofloxacin adsorbed into clinoptilolite pore cannot be fully oxidized due to bad mass transfer inside the cathode carbon felt box ofloxacin was completely removed in the ccia ef for 10 cycles indicating clinoptilolite could self regenerate well the efficient adsorption enrichment and oh oxidation of ofloxacin 14 is the key to the efficient and stable operation of the ccia ef that the aeration device is only moved from the outside of the cathode box to the inside can greatly improve pollutant removal and operation stability without any cost increase so the ccia ef is more cost effective than the ccea ef for practical applications in order to further verify the operation stability of the ccia ef the particle size surface morphology and element composition of clinoptilolite were detected using sem and eds techniques as shown in fig 7 compare fig 7a and b there was a little change in the main element proportion of the original clinoptilolite and that used for 10 cycles however the iron content of the clinoptilolite used for 10 cycles was 2 76 higher than that of the original the previous report showed the increase of iron content is conducive to the production of oh 29 the sem diagrams showed that the size shape and surface morphology of clinoptilolite particles changed little and they both had no obvious agglomeration after 10 cycles fig 7c and d aeration disturbance and oh oxidation had little effect on the physical and chemical properties of clinoptilolite in our experiment clinoptilolite was reported to have good stability in the electro fenton process 30 3 4 possible pathway of ofloxacin degradation in ccia ef in order to analyze the pathway of ofloxacin degradation in the ccia ef the main intermediates were determined by tof ms and their spectrums at the reaction time of 15 min and 60 min are shown in fig 8 during the ofloxacin degradation the mass to charge m z ratios the molecular formula and the chemical structure information of intermediates were listed in table 1 nine main compounds were identified at 15 min and 60 min according to the m z ratios and the functional groups of intermediate products the quinolone group piperazine group and oxazine group in ofloxacin can be degraded at different rates in ofloxacin degradation by oh oxidation and the pathway of ofloxacin degradation in ccia ef was proposed as shown in fig 9 there are three main pathways of degradation the first pathway is that the fluorine atom on the quinolone ring is oxidized by oh 31 the ipso attack occurs 32 33 and ofloxacin is transformed to c18h21n3o5 1 m z 360 8636 by the replacement fluorine atom with oh the substance 1 continues to be oxidized by oh loses methylene ch2 on piperazine group and oh at fluorine atom position 20 21 34 and generates c17h19n3o4 2 m z 328 9210 then the compound 2 is oxidized to c15h17n3o4 3 m z 305 9125 and further to c13h14n2o3 6 m z 246 8735 the second pathway is that the nitrogen atom on the piperazine group and its adjacent alkyl group are oxidized by oh the piperazine ring opens and quinolone group is decarboxylated to form c15h18fn3o2 4 m z 287 9011 and the product 4 is further oxidized and defluorinated to form the intermediate product c12h12n2o3 7 m z 230 9007 the third pathway is that the oxazine ring is broken to produce c13h13fn2o3 5 m z 264 8846 the ofloxacin molecules are decreased when some groups are oxidized by oh the result indicates that the intermediates need more time to be degraded while toc is reduced due to the degradation of the organic to inorganic matters such as co2 h2o and no3 14 those intermediates with smaller molecule are easier to be further degraded under aerobic condition 9 4 conclusion we newly designed a sandwich composite electrode in an electro fenton system in order to increase the utilization rate of oh and the degradation efficiency of organic matter the electrode adsorption and electro fenton degradation of ofloxacin coupling with green self regeneration of adsorbent in wastewater was much greater than that of the electro fenton system without adsorption the shortcomings of short existence time and low utilization rate of oh were perfectly solved due to the adsorption of ofloxacin on clinoptilolite in a cathode box made up of carbon felt the aeration generated by the aerator which was installed inside the cathode box could suspend clinoptilolite particles resulting in good mass transfer what s more internal aeration makes oh moving direction opposite to the enrichment of ofloxacin and then improves oh utilization rate resulting in the efficient degradation of ofloxacin in ccia ef the degradation efficiency of ofloxacin was 100 and toc removal efficiency was 82 7 0 4 at 105 min and the degradation efficiency of ofloxacin did not decrease for long term operation in ccia ef this study provides a new idea for efficient degradation of refractory organics and a practical alternative for electrode modification declaration of competing interest the authors declared that they have no conflicts of interest to this work

the ccea ef internal aeration has a significant impact on ofloxacin degradation 27 in electro fenton reactor the generation process of oh is 1 the dissolved oxygen supplied by aerator is reduced to generate h2o2 on the carbon felt cathode eq 2 2 h2o2 reacts with fe2 catalyst to form oh and fe3 in the acidic environment at ph of about 3 in the reactor eq 3 and 3 the resulting fe3 can be reduced to form fe2 on the cathode eq 4 realizing the regeneration of fe2 catalyst and guaranteeing the continuous generation of oh 28 2 o 2 2 h 2 e h 2 o 2 3 fe 2 h 2 o 2 fe 3 oh oh 4 fe 3 e fe 2 in the ccia ef during the degradation of ofloxacin the concentration of fe2 fe3 h2o2 and oh in the carbon felt box were measured and shown in fig 4 the concentration of fe2 decreased significantly within 15 min and then it was relatively stable at 39 4 3 3 mg l 1 the concentration of fe3 rose rapidly to 48 1 mg l 1 in 15 min and then the ratio of fe2 fe3 kept approximately 0 9 concentration of oh increased slowly and in the meanwhile the concentration of ofloxacin decreased from 25 0 3 to 2 7 0 6 mg l 1 in the initial 45 min which were consistent with high consumption of oh for the ofloxacin degradation h2o2 was simultaneously maintained at a low concentration due to the high catalytic activity of fe2 27 29 according to the above experimental data the probable mechanism of effective ofloxacin degradation by the adsorption electro fenton with green self regeneration function in ccia ef was as following as shown in fig 5 firstly oh is generated inside clinoptilolite carbon felt box used as the cathode and diffuses outward the oh movement is in the opposite direction to the ofloxacin adsorption and enrichment to clinoptilolite which increases the collision chance between oh and ofloxacin molecules 14 that effectively improves the utilization rate of oh secondly the suitable air flow generated by the aerator inside the carbon felt box can suspend the clinoptilolite particles and greatly improves mass transfer in the ccia ef finally ofloxacin adsorbed on clinoptilolite is removed by oh oxidation realizing the green self regeneration of clinoptilolite thus the adsorption and enrichment of ofloxacin onto clinoptilolite are continuously performed 3 3 performance of multi cycle operation in order to investigate the stability in long term operation the experiment was carried out many cycles under the condition identical as section 3 2 except that the same clinoptilolite in the carbon felt box was used all the time in multi cycle operation the removal efficiencies of ofloxacin in the ccia ef for 10 cycles and in the ccea ef for 5 cycles were presented in fig 6 in 10 cycles the degradation efficiency of ofloxacin could reach to 100 at 105 min in the ccia ef showing that the degradation performance was not weakened at all however in the ccea ef the degradation efficiency of ofloxacin decreased gradually with the increase of cycle at the first and fifth cycle the concentration of residual ofloxacin is 4 4 mg l 1 and 13 7 mg l 1 at 105 min respectively that is because ofloxacin adsorbed into clinoptilolite pore cannot be fully oxidized due to bad mass transfer inside the cathode carbon felt box ofloxacin was completely removed in the ccia ef for 10 cycles indicating clinoptilolite could self regenerate well the efficient adsorption enrichment and oh oxidation of ofloxacin 14 is the key to the efficient and stable operation of the ccia ef that the aeration device is only moved from the outside of the cathode box to the inside can greatly improve pollutant removal and operation stability without any cost increase so the ccia ef is more cost effective than the ccea ef for practical applications in order to further verify the operation stability of the ccia ef the particle size surface morphology and element composition of clinoptilolite were detected using sem and eds techniques as shown in fig 7 compare fig 7a and b there was a little change in the main element proportion of the original clinoptilolite and that used for 10 cycles however the iron content of the clinoptilolite used for 10 cycles was 2 76 higher than that of the original the previous report showed the increase of iron content is conducive to the production of oh 29 the sem diagrams showed that the size shape and surface morphology of clinoptilolite particles changed little and they both had no obvious agglomeration after 10 cycles fig 7c and d aeration disturbance and oh oxidation had little effect on the physical and chemical properties of clinoptilolite in our experiment clinoptilolite was reported to have good stability in the electro fenton process 30 3 4 possible pathway of ofloxacin degradation in ccia ef in order to analyze the pathway of ofloxacin degradation in the ccia ef the main intermediates were determined by tof ms and their spectrums at the reaction time of 15 min and 60 min are shown in fig 8 during the ofloxacin degradation the mass to charge m z ratios the molecular formula and the chemical structure information of intermediates were listed in table 1 nine main compounds were identified at 15 min and 60 min according to the m z ratios and the functional groups of intermediate products the quinolone group piperazine group and oxazine group in ofloxacin can be degraded at different rates in ofloxacin degradation by oh oxidation and the pathway of ofloxacin degradation in ccia ef was proposed as shown in fig 9 there are three main pathways of degradation the first pathway is that the fluorine atom on the quinolone ring is oxidized by oh 31 the ipso attack occurs 32 33 and ofloxacin is transformed to c18h21n3o5 1 m z 360 8636 by the replacement fluorine atom with oh the substance 1 continues to be oxidized by oh loses methylene ch2 on piperazine group and oh at fluorine atom position 20 21 34 and generates c17h19n3o4 2 m z 328 9210 then the compound 2 is oxidized to c15h17n3o4 3 m z 305 9125 and further to c13h14n2o3 6 m z 246 8735 the second pathway is that the nitrogen atom on the piperazine group and its adjacent alkyl group are oxidized by oh the piperazine ring opens and quinolone group is decarboxylated to form c15h18fn3o2 4 m z 287 9011 and the product 4 is further oxidized and defluorinated to form the intermediate product c12h12n2o3 7 m z 230 9007 the third pathway is that the oxazine ring is broken to produce c13h13fn2o3 5 m z 264 8846 the ofloxacin molecules are decreased when some groups are oxidized by oh the result indicates that the intermediates need more time to be degraded while toc is reduced due to the degradation of the organic to inorganic matters such as co2 h2o and no3 14 those intermediates with smaller molecule are easier to be further degraded under aerobic condition 9 4 conclusion we newly designed a sandwich composite electrode in an electro fenton system in order to increase the utilization rate of oh and the degradation efficiency of organic matter the electrode adsorption and electro fenton degradation of ofloxacin coupling with green self regeneration of adsorbent in wastewater was much greater than that of the electro fenton system without adsorption the shortcomings of short existence time and low utilization rate of oh were perfectly solved due to the adsorption of ofloxacin on clinoptilolite in a cathode box made up of carbon felt the aeration generated by the aerator which was installed inside the cathode box could suspend clinoptilolite particles resulting in good mass transfer what s more internal aeration makes oh moving direction opposite to the enrichment of ofloxacin and then improves oh utilization rate resulting in the efficient degradation of ofloxacin in ccia ef the degradation efficiency of ofloxacin was 100 and toc removal efficiency was 82 7 0 4 at 105 min and the degradation efficiency of ofloxacin did not decrease for long term operation in ccia ef this study provides a new idea for efficient degradation of refractory organics and a practical alternative for electrode modification declaration of competing interest the authors declared that they have no conflicts of interest to this work

12943,in recent years the uv sulfite process has shown high superiority in removing toxic halogenated organic compounds and oxyanions herein the reduction of bromate bro3ˉ in this process was reinvestigated the reduction of bro3ˉ in this process was influenced by some key coexisting species a significant inhibition on the reduction of bro3ˉ was observed in the presence of dissolved oxygen do nevertheless increasing sulfite dosage could effectively mitigate the negative impact of do on the reduction of bro3ˉ humic acid ha could influence the reduction of bro3ˉ through the enhancement of hydrated electron eaqˉ yield or the scavenging of eaqˉ it should be noted that the presence of cl and hco3 had an insignificant influence on the reduction of bro3ˉ in this process besides eaqˉ sulfite radical so3 also contributed to the reduction of bro3ˉ which was evidenced by scavenging experiments and fitting of a kinetic model moreover the energy efficiency of this process for bro3ˉ removal was found to be enhanced by increasing sulfite dosage as indicated by calculation of electrical energy per order ee o meanwhile this process was proven to be economical for bro3ˉ removal this study might provide a new outlook on the uv sulfite process for real applications keywords bromate uv sulfite process key coexisting species sulfite radical energy efficiency 1 introduction bromate bro3ˉ is recognized as a major disinfection byproduct and classified as a potential b2 carcinogen by the international agency for the research on cancer iarc in 1990 1 due to the genotoxicity and carcinogenicity of bro3ˉ 2 the maximum contaminant level mcl of bro3ˉ in drinking water has been set at 10 μg l 1 in the united states europe japan and china 3 bro3ˉ is generally reported to generate during ozonation chlorination of source waters containing bromide brˉ 4 6 however recent studies have revealed that bro3ˉ could be also observed in the water treated by advanced oxidation processes aops including co ii peroxymonosulfate 7 uv persulfate 8 12 heat persulfate 13 14 ozone peroxymonosulfate o3 pms 15 and catalytic chlorination 16 17 processes bro3ˉ is highly soluble and thermally stable so it easily persists and accumulates in aquatic environment 18 if not properly removed bro3ˉ could accumulate and pose a great threat to aquatic organisms and human health therefore various efforts have been made to minimize the generation of bro3ˉ or directly remove bro3ˉ after its generation in water treatment membrane filtration ion exchange and precipitation have been employed to remove background brˉ before the disinfection oxidation process 19 to minimize bro3ˉ formation during the ozonation process various approaches including ammonia addition ph depression and scavenging hydroxyl radical ho and hypobromous acid hobr by dosing organic compounds have been proposed 20 however the application of these techniques are always limited to the complicated procedures harsh conditions and high treatment costs 21 therefore many techniques such as adsorption 22 photolysis 23 photocatalysis 24 25 chemical reduction 21 electrochemical reduction 26 and biological reduction 27 have been developed to directly remove bro3ˉ from drinking water after its generation nevertheless most of these techniques have not been applied in real applications in recent years sulfite based advanced reduction processes arps known as uv sulfite process have received wide attention due to its outstanding reduction efficiency 28 these arps rely on the produced highly reducing species including hydrated electron eaqˉ e o 2 9 v 29 and hydrogen atom h e o 2 3 v 29 to efficiently reduce target contaminants importantly uv disinfection is a major component of water treatment processes meanwhile sulfite is eventually transformed into sulfate after uv irradiation which will cause no secondary pollution to aquatic environment therefore the uv sulfite process has a high potential for application in real water treatment so far the uv sulfite process has shown its superiority in removing toxic organic halogenated compounds e g monochloroacetic acid 30 31 vinyl chloride 32 1 2 dichloroethane 33 2 4 dichlorophenol 34 and per and polyfluoroalkyl substances 35 and oxyanions e g perchlorate 36 nitrate 37 and chromate 28 since bro3ˉ is one of toxic oxyanions bro3ˉ removal by the uv sulfite process has been also investigated by several studies 23 38 43 in these studies the reduction efficiencies and rates of bro3ˉ in the uv sulfite process were significantly inhibited by dissolved oxygen do humic acid ha was reported to enhance or inhibit the reduction of bro3ˉ depending on its concentration and chemical characteristics 40 nevertheless the effects of do and ha on bro3ˉ removal by the uv sulfite process are still not deeply explored and well understood for instance although do can substantially decrease the reduction of bro3ˉ due to its fast and efficient scavenging of eaqˉ 1 9 1010 m 1 s 1 29 alleviation of the negative impact of do on bro3ˉ reduction by sulfite is unknown note that sulfite is a commonly used oxygen scavenger moreover the mechanisms behind the enhancing or inhibiting effect of ha on bro3ˉ reduction by the uv sulfite process were not clarified in the literatures the enhancing effect of ha was simply attributed to the improving effect of ha on eaqˉ generation 40 meanwhile the inhibiting effect of ha occurred because ha could scavenge eaqˉ and also compete with sulfite for protons to alleviate the yield of eaqˉ 38 40 42 the researchers seldom investigated the role of ha moieties in the enhancing or inhibiting effect of ha on bro3ˉ reduction by the uv sulfite process besides the effects of do and ha the role of sulfite radical so3 during bro3ˉ removal by the uv sulfite process is also neither perceived nor well recognized in these studies note that so3 can donate an electron to act as a reductant furthermore the economic cost of the uv sulfite process is rarely reported since both energy and chemical cost should be considered for large scale application therefore in this study the effects of key coexisting species do ha and anions on bro3ˉ removal by the uv sulfite process were deeply explored then the role of so3 in bro3ˉ removal was identified by scavenging experiments and fitting of a kinetic model finally the economic cost of this process for bro3ˉ removal was evaluated in terms of electrical energy per order ee o and electricity cost the results of this study are expected to build a strong foundation for the application of the uv sulfite process in real practice 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals all the chemicals and reagents provided in text s1 of supporting information were used as received without further purification in this study all the solutions were prepared using deionized water 18 2 mω produced by a milli q ultrapure water system 2 2 experimental procedures all the photolysis experiments were conducted in a manmade cylindrical borosilicate glass photoreactor v 1 0 l a 10 w low pressure mercury uv lamp 253 7 nm gph212t5l heraeus noblelight was placed in the center of the photoreactor with a quartz envelope as the uv light source fig s1 the photon flux i 0 entering the solution from the uv source was determined to be 2 02 10 6 einstein s 1 by the ki kio3 method fig s2 44 meanwhile the effective path length l of light was calculated to be 4 39 cm by the photolysis kinetics of dilute h2o2 fig s3 45 moreover the average fluence rate i s was estimated to be 0 89 10 8 einstein s 1 cm 2 or 4 19 mw cm 2 the reaction temperature was controlled at 25 0 5 c using a thermostatic water recirculation system the reaction solution was buffered 10 0 mm phosphate buffer for ph 6 0 7 0 and borate buffer for ph 8 0 10 0 to control the ph constant during the reaction the reaction solutions for the experiments under oxygen free conditions were purged with n2 for 30 min before the initiation of the reaction to make sure that the concentration of do is less than 0 10 mg l 1 moreover the n2 purging stopped till the reaction completed note that the experiments under aerobic conditions were operated without n2 purging and open to air the uv lamp was illuminated for more than 30 min prior to each uv irradiation experiment at predetermined time intervals samples were withdrawn and mixed with or without a quencher 0 50 m h2o2 for analysis all the experiments were conducted in duplicate or triplicate and average values with error bars are presented unless otherwise stated specifically all the rate constants were obtained by fitting the average values of experimental data using the software sigmaplot 2 3 analytical methods bro3ˉ was quantified with an ion chromatograph ics 5000 dionex equipped with an as19 analytical column 2 250 mm and an ag19 guard column 2 50 mm the concentrations of residual sulfite were determined with a previously described method 46 uv vis absorbance and absorption spectrum were carried out on a uv vis spectrophotometer cary 60 agilent the concentrations of phenol and benzoic acid ba were measured with an ultra performance liquid chromatography acquity uplc h class waters more details were provided in text s2 a kinetic model was built using kintecus v6 51 a well known chemical kinetic modeling software to simulate the reduction kinetics of bro3ˉ when the role of so3 in the reduction of bro3ˉ by the uv sulfite process was investigated the second order rate constants k for all the involved reactions table 1 were obtained either from literatures or by fitting experimental data 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of key coexisting species on bro3ˉ removal by the uv sulfite process 3 1 1 dissolved oxygen fig 1 shows the effect of do on the kinetics and rates of bro3ˉ reduction at different ph levels fig 1a c and sulfite concentrations fig 1d f in the uv sulfite process at ph 7 0 7 8 and 35 3 of bro3ˉ were removed by sulfite alone and uv irradiation alone 120 min respectively under oxygen free conditions in contrast the reduction efficiencies of bro3ˉ were less than 1 0 and 26 2 for sulfite alone and uv irradiation alone 60 min respectively under aerobic conditions obviously under both oxygen free and aerobic conditions the reduction of bro3ˉ by sulfite was greatly enhanced due to the uv irradiation moreover the reduction kinetics of bro3ˉ in the uv sulfite process followed the pseudo first order rate law eqs 1 2 as the solution ph increased from 6 0 to 10 0 the reduction rate of bro3ˉ increased from 0 0119 to 0 0279 min 1 under oxygen free conditions while elevating from 0 0087 to 0 0171 min 1 under aerobic conditions so3 2ˉ was the main species of sulfite pk a1 1 8 and pk a2 7 2 formed at alkaline ph when the solution ph increased from 6 0 to 10 0 the fraction of so3 2ˉ increased from 5 9 to 99 8 fig s5 note that eaqˉ is mainly generated from the photolysis of so3 2ˉ 30 meanwhile the degradation rate of sulfite k sulfite also linearly increased with increasing the solution ph figs s4a and s5 which would be attributed to the increased absorbance of sulfite at 253 7 nm fig s6 therefore these results suggested that the increase of ph from 6 0 to 10 0 enhanced the photolysis of sulfite to generate more eaqˉ for the reduction of bro3ˉ 1 dt bro 3 dt k obs bro 3 2 ln bro 3 bro 3 0 k obs t compared to the removal of bro3ˉ under oxygen free conditions the increase of ph showed less positive effect on the removal rate of bro3ˉ under aerobic conditions under aerobic conditions eaqˉ could be rapidly consumed by do thus inhibiting the removal of bro3ˉ as shown in fig s4b under aerobic conditions the concentrations of sulfite showed a two stage decay kinetics a rapid decline in the first 5 0 min and a slow decay after 5 0 min the concentration of do was found to rapidly drop to below 0 20 mg l 1 in the first 5 0 min and maintain at this level till the reaction ended data not shown therefore the rapid drop of the sulfite concentration in the first 5 0 min should be mainly due to the fast reaction of do with so3 generated from the photolysis of so3 2ˉ so3 could rapidly react with do to form so5 which would further react with sulfite to generate so4 21 meanwhile sulfite could be partly oxidized to so4 2ˉ by do to confirm the formation of so3 and so4 esr spectra were collected with dmpo as a spin trap as shown in fig s7 typical dmpo ho signal was observed at only 2 0 min meanwhile dmpo so4 was not obviously observed because the rapid transformation of dmpo so4 adduct to dmpo ho adduct could occur via nucleophilic substitution by h2o oh 47 in contrast only dmpo so3 signal was observed at 5 0 min and 15 0 min moreover the signal intensity of dmpo so3 at 15 0 min was higher than that at 5 0 min these results verified that the sharp decline of do in the first 5 0 min was ascribed to the reaction of so3 with do when do was dropped to below 0 20 mg l 1 sulfite was mainly consumed by the uv photolysis thus the concentrations of sulfite decayed slowly after 5 0 min besides ph the sulfite dosage also strongly influenced the reduction efficiencies and rates of bro3ˉ in the uv sulfite process obviously increasing the sulfite dosage greatly accelerated the reduction of bro3ˉ in this process at ph 7 0 under both oxygen free and aerobic conditions fig 1d e under oxygen free conditions the pseudo first order rates of bro3ˉ reduction were determined to be 0 0126 0 0185 0 0248 and 0 0341 min 1 respectively when sulfite was dosed at 0 50 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 mm the increase of sulfite dosage could enhance the generation of eaqˉ for the reduction of bro3ˉ when the dosage of sulfite was fixed at 0 50 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 mm respectively 0 33 0 39 0 43 and 0 48 mm sulfite were consumed respectively fig s4c in contrast under aerobic conditions the reduction rates of bro3ˉ were 0 0109 0 0158 and 0 0212 min 1 respectively when sulfite was dosed at 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 mm obviously do significantly inhibited the reduction of bro3ˉ which should be ascribed to the competition of do with bro3ˉ for eaqˉ to achieve the reduction of certain amount of bro3ˉ more sulfite was consumed under aerobic conditions than that under oxygen free conditions fig s4d nevertheless an efficient reduction of bro3ˉ could be achieved by increasing the dosage of sulfite under aerobic conditions 3 1 2 humic acid since ha is ubiquitous in raw water its influence on bro3ˉ reduction in the uv sulfite process should be evaluated for application in real practice fig 2a c illustrates the effect of ha on the reduction of bro3ˉ at ph 7 0 and ph 10 0 in the uv sulfite process addition of 1 0 mg l 1 ha hardly influenced the reduction of bro3ˉ at ph 7 0 but enhanced the reduction of bro3ˉ at ph 10 0 and the reduction rate of bro3ˉ increased from 0 0185 to 0 0190 min 1 at ph 7 0 while increasing from 0 0279 to 0 0378 min 1 at ph 10 0 the enhancing effect of 1 0 mg l 1 ha at ph 10 0 should be mainly ascribed to the enhanced generation of eaqˉ from the photoionization of ha surprisingly the further increase of ha concentration from 1 0 to 5 0 mg l 1 caused a slightly negative effect on the reduction of bro3ˉ at ph 7 0 and ph 10 0 and the reduction rate of bro3ˉ decreased from 0 0185 to 0 0145 min 1 at ph 7 0 while decreasing from 0 0279 to 0 0249 min 1 at ph 10 0 the inhibiting effect of 5 0 mg l 1 ha at ph 7 0 and ph 10 0 may be because ha could scavenge eaqˉ and or compete with sulfite for protons to alleviate the yield of eaqˉ nevertheless the addition of 1 0 and 5 0 mg l 1 ha reduced the average light intensity to 95 8 and 95 6 of the incident light intensity respectively fig s8 this result indicated that the uv blocking effect of ha could be almost neglected furthermore it was worth noting that ph 10 0 seemed more favorable for the generation of eaqˉ in the presence of ha than ph 7 0 at ph 10 0 the reduction of bro3ˉ was enhanced in the presence of 1 0 mg l 1 ha meanwhile the inhibitory effect of ha on the reduction of bro3ˉ in the presence of 5 0 mg l 1 ha was mitigated at ph 10 0 compared to that at ph 7 0 ha is a macromolecular organic compound with aromatic and alicyclic rings and contains many functional groups such as carboxyl cooh 14 45 phenol ph 10 38 alcohol r oh 13 15 carbonyl c o 4 23 and methoxyl o ch3 1 5 48 it has been proposed that the promoting or inhibiting effect of ha on contaminants degradation in arps depends on the functional groups of ha 49 phenol and carboxyl groups are highly distributed in ha thus phenol pk a 9 98 50 and benzoic acid ba pk a 4 2 51 were selected as the representatives of the two functional groups respectively to further probe the effect of ha on the reduction of bro3ˉ in the uv sulfite process fig 2d f presents the effects of phenol and ba on the reduction of bro3ˉ at ph 7 0 and ph 10 0 in the uv sulfite process at ph 7 0 the reduction rate of bro3ˉ in the uv sulfite process increased from 0 0185 to 0 0273 and 0 0935 min 1 after dosing 0 10 mm phenol and ba respectively compared to the case at ph 7 0 the effects of phenol and ba on the reduction of bro3ˉ at ph 10 0 were a little complicated in the presence of phenol the concentration of bro3ˉ was almost completely exhausted in the first 30 min but increased slowly after 30 min in contrast the reduction of bro3ˉ in the presence of ba was slightly different from that in the presence of phenol it was observed that the concentration of bro3ˉ decreased by more than 95 in the first 10 min in the presence of ba nevertheless the concentration of bro3ˉ would increase from 10 to 60 min and decrease after 60 min these odd phenomena should be ascribed to the reaction of brˉ the final reduction product of bro3ˉ with the degradation products of phenol and ba more details were presented in text s3 note that the photoionization of phenol and ba could also reduce bro3ˉ in the absence of sulfite fig s10 it has been reported that phenol and ba under uv irradiation can also generate eaqˉ whose yield can be enhanced by the increase of ph fig s10 52 therefore the higher reduction efficiencies of bro3ˉ under uv irradiation in the presence of both sulfite and phenol ba would be probably attributed to a synergistic effect of sulfite and phenol ba on enhancing the yield of eaqˉ compared to that in the absence of sulfite or phenol ba the presence of phenol and ba significantly enhanced the consumption rate of sulfite in the uv sulfite process fig s11 meanwhile the consumption rate of sulfite in the presence of ba was higher than that in the presence of phenol compared with sulfite ε so 3 2 18 14 m 1 cm 1 30 phenol ε c 6 h 5 o 942 43 m 1 cm 1 50 and ba ε c 6 h 5 coo 760 0 m 1 cm 1 53 absorbed uv light more efficiently at 253 7 nm fig s12 this result indicated that the presence of phenol or ba should have decreased the consumption of sulfite by their competitive absorption for photons meanwhile in the presence of sulfite the degradation of phenol was significantly inhibited while the decay of ba was greatly accelerated fig s13 therefore these results suggested that sulfite probably played a role in transforming phenol and ba so as to maintain the fast reduction rate of bro3ˉ the similar result was also described in the sulfite iodide uv process for the degradation of monochloroacetic acid 54 phenol is irradiated by uv to generate eaqˉ and phenoxyl radical c6h5o 55 57 meanwhile ba is photoionized to produce eaqˉ and benzoyloxyl radical c6h5coo which further rapidly releases co2 to form phenyl radical c6h5 58 59 thus the retarded degradation of phenol in the presence of sulfite could be ascribed to the reduction of c6h5o by sulfite to phenol 1 0 107 m 1 s 1 60 on the other hand sulfite may rapidly react with c6h5 to generate phenyl anions c6h5 resulting in an increase in the degradation of ba in the uv sulfite process according to previous studies phenol has a higher quantum yield of eaqˉ than sulfite φ c6h5oˉ 0 25 vs φ so3 2 0 116 30 50 ba might have even a higher quantum yield of eaqˉ than phenol because eaqˉ could be further generated from the photoionization of c6h5 this could be verified by the much higher reduction rate of bro3ˉ enhanced by ba than phenol therefore as reported in the sulfite iodide uv process 54 sulfite could reduce c6h5o and c6h5 to maintain relatively high concentrations of phenol and c6h5 for an efficient and steady production of eaq moreover the photoionization of phenol and ba failed to show the correspondingly higher reduction efficiencies and rates of bro3ˉ than the uv sulfite process fig s10 note that phenol and ba have higher quantum yields of eaqˉ than sulfite thus the high reduction rate of bro3ˉ in the presence of phenol and ba might be also because sulfite could minimize the scavenging effect of c6h5o and c6h5 for eaqˉ based on all the above results it could be concluded that the functional groups of ha could influence reduction of bro3ˉ in the uv sulfite process through the enhancement of eaqˉ yield or the scavenging of eaqˉ nevertheless further investigation should be conducted to completely understand the effect of ha on the reduction of bro3ˉ in the uv sulfite process besides phenol and ba model compounds with the other functional groups e g r oh c o and o ch3 and even two or more functional groups should be selected for future study 3 1 3 anions cl and hco3 are the most common anions in natural water thus their influence on the reduction of bro3ˉ in the uv sulfite process was also evaluated as shown in fig 3 the presence of cl and hco3 had a slight influence on the reduction of bro3ˉ in the uv sulfite process the reduction rate of bro3ˉ decreased to 0 0167 min 1 and 0 0139 min 1 respectively in the presence of 2 mm and 10 mm cl meanwhile the addition of 2 mm and 10 mm hco3 decreased the reduction rate of bro3ˉ to 0 0166 min 1 and 0 0142 min 1 respectively the insignificant influence of cl and hco3 on the reduction of bro3ˉ in the uv sulfite process could be ascribed to their low reactivity toward eaqˉ 1 0 106 m 1 s 1 29 3 2 role of so3 in the uv sulfite process 3 2 1 scavenging experiments besides eaqˉ so3 also generates from uv irradiation of sulfite eaqˉ has a much more negative reduction potential than so3 and thus has been often identified as the major reactive species for the reduction of contaminants nevertheless it should be noted that so3 can donate an electron to act as a reductant thus to identify the role of so3 during the reduction of bro3ˉ no3ˉ was used as the scavenger of eaqˉ k e aq no3 9 7 109 m 1 s 1 29 61 to figure out the contribution of eaqˉ to the reduction of bro3ˉ as shown in fig 4a no3ˉ almost did not exert a negative impact on the reduction of bro3ˉ by uv irradiation alone but significantly inhibited the reduction of bro3ˉ in the uv sulfite process after the addition of no3ˉ the reduction rate of bro3ˉ by uv irradiation alone decreased from 0 0046 to 0 0042 min 1 in contrast the reduction rate of bro3ˉ in the uv sulfite process decreased from 0 0279 to 0 0107 min 1 fig s14 which indicated that no3ˉ did quench eaqˉ for the reduction of bro3ˉ nevertheless 2 0 mm no3ˉ can theoretically quench all the produced eaqˉ and totally terminate the contribution of eaqˉ to the reduction of bro3ˉ thus an incomplete inhibition on the contribution of eaqˉ in the presence of 2 0 mm no3ˉ implied that besides eaqˉ other reactive species might also play a non negligible role in the reduction of bro3ˉ note that eaqˉ and so3 are the two of reactive species generated at ph 10 0 in the uv sulfite process therefore it could be inferred that besides uv irradiation and eaqˉ so3 can also reduce bro3ˉ to confirm the role of so3 in the reduction of bro3ˉ nitrobenzene nb was selected as a contrast compound for scavenging experiments as seen from fig 4b the concentration of nb showed no change after only magnetic stirring for 45 min meaning that nb would be hardly volatile from the reaction solution under this condition nevertheless 16 7 of nb was degraded after uv irradiation alone while the degradation efficiency of nb reached 42 4 in the uv sulfite process when 1 0 mm no3ˉ was added into the uv sulfite process the degradation efficiency and kinetics of nb were almost comparable to that after uv irradiation alone these results suggested that eaqˉ was the dominant reactive species for the degradation of nb in the uv sulfite process in contrast both eaqˉ and so3 contributed to the reduction of bro3ˉ in the uv sulfite process thus the addition of 2 0 mm no3ˉ did not completely inhibit the reduction of bro3ˉ when the contribution of uv irradiation was ruled out based on the above results of the scavenging experiments using bro3ˉ and nb as the target compounds it could be further confirmed that so3 did participate in the reduction of bro3ˉ by the uv sulfite process 3 2 2 kinetic modeling the contribution of so3 to the reduction of bro3ˉ in the uv sulfite process was evidenced by the scavenging experiments to further confirm the role of so3 in the reduction of bro3ˉ a kinetic model was established as illustrated in fig 4a the reduction kinetics of bro3ˉ by uv irradiation alone and the uv sulfite process could be well fitted by the kinetic model even after the addition of 2 0 mm no3ˉ in the uv sulfite process the reduction kinetics of bro3ˉ in the first 60 min could be still well predicted by the kinetic model therefore the successful fitting of the experimental data by the kinetic model further confirmed the contribution of so3 to the reduction of bro3ˉ in the uv sulfite process 3 3 economic evaluation of the uv sulfite process for bromate removal 3 3 1 energy efficiency as shown in table s2 the uv sulfite process required lower uv fluence for bro3ˉ removal than most of uv based reduction processes this suggested that the uv sulfite process had the great potential to be applied for bro3ˉ removal in real water to examine this potential the energy efficiency of the uv sulfite process for bro3ˉ removal under both oxygen free and aerobic conditions was evaluated by ee o the detailed calculation process was summarized in text s4 as presented in fig 5 under oxygen free conditions the ee ototal value decreased from 2 8 10 2 to 4 85 10 3 kwh l 1 order 1 with increasing the dosage of sulfite from 0 50 to 2 0 mm in contrast the ee ototal value decreased from 3 78 10 2 to 1 59 10 2 kwh l 1 order 1 under aerobic conditions when the dosage of sulfite increased from 1 0 to 2 0 mm at the same sulfite dosage the ee ototal values under oxygen free conditions were smaller than that under aerobic conditions this result implied that the energy efficiency under oxygen free conditions was higher than that under aerobic conditions this is because the fraction of eaqˉ and so3 allocated for bro3ˉ removal under oxygen free conditions was higher than that under aerobic conditions in other words both sulfite the source of eaqˉ and so3 and eaqˉ were partly consumed by do under aerobic conditions nevertheless in both cases increasing the dosage of sulfite can improve the energy efficiency of the uv sulfite process for bro3ˉ removal 3 3 2 treatment cost to further evaluate the potential of the uv sulfite process for real application the treatment cost of this process for bro3ˉ removal was compared under different conditions as shown in table s3 the electricity cost of this process for bro3ˉ removal under different conditions was only 0 02 l 1 this result suggested that it was economical to apply the uv sulfite process to remove bro3ˉ in real water nevertheless it should be noted that the ee ototal values significantly increased in the presence of ha cl and hco3 with the higher concentrations this is because eaqˉ would be consumed by these species thereby decreasing the removal efficiencies of bro3ˉ in the uv sulfite process 4 conclusion the present study provided insights into bro3ˉ removal in the uv sulfite process by reinvestigating the effects of key coexisting species do ha and anions the role of so3 and the economic cost in terms of ee o and electricity cost the major conclusions could be drawn as follows 1 the reduction of bro3ˉ was significantly inhibited by do due to the rapid consumption of eaqˉ and sulfite by do nevertheless an effective reduction of bro3ˉ could be still achieved by increasing the dosage of sulfite in the presence of do 2 the effect of ha on the reduction of bro3ˉ should be mainly ascribed to the enhancement of eaqˉ yield or the scavenging of eaqˉ caused by the functional groups of ha 3 cl and hco3 had an insignificant influence on the reduction of bro3ˉ due to their low reactivity toward eaqˉ 4 although eaqˉ acted as the dominant reactive species for bro3ˉ removal so3 also contributed to the reduction of bro3ˉ 5 increasing the dosage of sulfite could improve the energy efficiency of the uv sulfite process for bro3ˉ removal under oxygen free and aerobic conditions nevertheless at the same sulfite dosage the energy efficiency under oxygen free conditions was higher than that under aerobic conditions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

12943,in recent years the uv sulfite process has shown high superiority in removing toxic halogenated organic compounds and oxyanions herein the reduction of bromate bro3ˉ in this process was reinvestigated the reduction of bro3ˉ in this process was influenced by some key coexisting species a significant inhibition on the reduction of bro3ˉ was observed in the presence of dissolved oxygen do nevertheless increasing sulfite dosage could effectively mitigate the negative impact of do on the reduction of bro3ˉ humic acid ha could influence the reduction of bro3ˉ through the enhancement of hydrated electron eaqˉ yield or the scavenging of eaqˉ it should be noted that the presence of cl and hco3 had an insignificant influence on the reduction of bro3ˉ in this process besides eaqˉ sulfite radical so3 also contributed to the reduction of bro3ˉ which was evidenced by scavenging experiments and fitting of a kinetic model moreover the energy efficiency of this process for bro3ˉ removal was found to be enhanced by increasing sulfite dosage as indicated by calculation of electrical energy per order ee o meanwhile this process was proven to be economical for bro3ˉ removal this study might provide a new outlook on the uv sulfite process for real applications keywords bromate uv sulfite process key coexisting species sulfite radical energy efficiency 1 introduction bromate bro3ˉ is recognized as a major disinfection byproduct and classified as a potential b2 carcinogen by the international agency for the research on cancer iarc in 1990 1 due to the genotoxicity and carcinogenicity of bro3ˉ 2 the maximum contaminant level mcl of bro3ˉ in drinking water has been set at 10 μg l 1 in the united states europe japan and china 3 bro3ˉ is generally reported to generate during ozonation chlorination of source waters containing bromide brˉ 4 6 however recent studies have revealed that bro3ˉ could be also observed in the water treated by advanced oxidation processes aops including co ii peroxymonosulfate 7 uv persulfate 8 12 heat persulfate 13 14 ozone peroxymonosulfate o3 pms 15 and catalytic chlorination 16 17 processes bro3ˉ is highly soluble and thermally stable so it easily persists and accumulates in aquatic environment 18 if not properly removed bro3ˉ could accumulate and pose a great threat to aquatic organisms and human health therefore various efforts have been made to minimize the generation of bro3ˉ or directly remove bro3ˉ after its generation in water treatment membrane filtration ion exchange and precipitation have been employed to remove background brˉ before the disinfection oxidation process 19 to minimize bro3ˉ formation during the ozonation process various approaches including ammonia addition ph depression and scavenging hydroxyl radical ho and hypobromous acid hobr by dosing organic compounds have been proposed 20 however the application of these techniques are always limited to the complicated procedures harsh conditions and high treatment costs 21 therefore many techniques such as adsorption 22 photolysis 23 photocatalysis 24 25 chemical reduction 21 electrochemical reduction 26 and biological reduction 27 have been developed to directly remove bro3ˉ from drinking water after its generation nevertheless most of these techniques have not been applied in real applications in recent years sulfite based advanced reduction processes arps known as uv sulfite process have received wide attention due to its outstanding reduction efficiency 28 these arps rely on the produced highly reducing species including hydrated electron eaqˉ e o 2 9 v 29 and hydrogen atom h e o 2 3 v 29 to efficiently reduce target contaminants importantly uv disinfection is a major component of water treatment processes meanwhile sulfite is eventually transformed into sulfate after uv irradiation which will cause no secondary pollution to aquatic environment therefore the uv sulfite process has a high potential for application in real water treatment so far the uv sulfite process has shown its superiority in removing toxic organic halogenated compounds e g monochloroacetic acid 30 31 vinyl chloride 32 1 2 dichloroethane 33 2 4 dichlorophenol 34 and per and polyfluoroalkyl substances 35 and oxyanions e g perchlorate 36 nitrate 37 and chromate 28 since bro3ˉ is one of toxic oxyanions bro3ˉ removal by the uv sulfite process has been also investigated by several studies 23 38 43 in these studies the reduction efficiencies and rates of bro3ˉ in the uv sulfite process were significantly inhibited by dissolved oxygen do humic acid ha was reported to enhance or inhibit the reduction of bro3ˉ depending on its concentration and chemical characteristics 40 nevertheless the effects of do and ha on bro3ˉ removal by the uv sulfite process are still not deeply explored and well understood for instance although do can substantially decrease the reduction of bro3ˉ due to its fast and efficient scavenging of eaqˉ 1 9 1010 m 1 s 1 29 alleviation of the negative impact of do on bro3ˉ reduction by sulfite is unknown note that sulfite is a commonly used oxygen scavenger moreover the mechanisms behind the enhancing or inhibiting effect of ha on bro3ˉ reduction by the uv sulfite process were not clarified in the literatures the enhancing effect of ha was simply attributed to the improving effect of ha on eaqˉ generation 40 meanwhile the inhibiting effect of ha occurred because ha could scavenge eaqˉ and also compete with sulfite for protons to alleviate the yield of eaqˉ 38 40 42 the researchers seldom investigated the role of ha moieties in the enhancing or inhibiting effect of ha on bro3ˉ reduction by the uv sulfite process besides the effects of do and ha the role of sulfite radical so3 during bro3ˉ removal by the uv sulfite process is also neither perceived nor well recognized in these studies note that so3 can donate an electron to act as a reductant furthermore the economic cost of the uv sulfite process is rarely reported since both energy and chemical cost should be considered for large scale application therefore in this study the effects of key coexisting species do ha and anions on bro3ˉ removal by the uv sulfite process were deeply explored then the role of so3 in bro3ˉ removal was identified by scavenging experiments and fitting of a kinetic model finally the economic cost of this process for bro3ˉ removal was evaluated in terms of electrical energy per order ee o and electricity cost the results of this study are expected to build a strong foundation for the application of the uv sulfite process in real practice 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals all the chemicals and reagents provided in text s1 of supporting information were used as received without further purification in this study all the solutions were prepared using deionized water 18 2 mω produced by a milli q ultrapure water system 2 2 experimental procedures all the photolysis experiments were conducted in a manmade cylindrical borosilicate glass photoreactor v 1 0 l a 10 w low pressure mercury uv lamp 253 7 nm gph212t5l heraeus noblelight was placed in the center of the photoreactor with a quartz envelope as the uv light source fig s1 the photon flux i 0 entering the solution from the uv source was determined to be 2 02 10 6 einstein s 1 by the ki kio3 method fig s2 44 meanwhile the effective path length l of light was calculated to be 4 39 cm by the photolysis kinetics of dilute h2o2 fig s3 45 moreover the average fluence rate i s was estimated to be 0 89 10 8 einstein s 1 cm 2 or 4 19 mw cm 2 the reaction temperature was controlled at 25 0 5 c using a thermostatic water recirculation system the reaction solution was buffered 10 0 mm phosphate buffer for ph 6 0 7 0 and borate buffer for ph 8 0 10 0 to control the ph constant during the reaction the reaction solutions for the experiments under oxygen free conditions were purged with n2 for 30 min before the initiation of the reaction to make sure that the concentration of do is less than 0 10 mg l 1 moreover the n2 purging stopped till the reaction completed note that the experiments under aerobic conditions were operated without n2 purging and open to air the uv lamp was illuminated for more than 30 min prior to each uv irradiation experiment at predetermined time intervals samples were withdrawn and mixed with or without a quencher 0 50 m h2o2 for analysis all the experiments were conducted in duplicate or triplicate and average values with error bars are presented unless otherwise stated specifically all the rate constants were obtained by fitting the average values of experimental data using the software sigmaplot 2 3 analytical methods bro3ˉ was quantified with an ion chromatograph ics 5000 dionex equipped with an as19 analytical column 2 250 mm and an ag19 guard column 2 50 mm the concentrations of residual sulfite were determined with a previously described method 46 uv vis absorbance and absorption spectrum were carried out on a uv vis spectrophotometer cary 60 agilent the concentrations of phenol and benzoic acid ba were measured with an ultra performance liquid chromatography acquity uplc h class waters more details were provided in text s2 a kinetic model was built using kintecus v6 51 a well known chemical kinetic modeling software to simulate the reduction kinetics of bro3ˉ when the role of so3 in the reduction of bro3ˉ by the uv sulfite process was investigated the second order rate constants k for all the involved reactions table 1 were obtained either from literatures or by fitting experimental data 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of key coexisting species on bro3ˉ removal by the uv sulfite process 3 1 1 dissolved oxygen fig 1 shows the effect of do on the kinetics and rates of bro3ˉ reduction at different ph levels fig 1a c and sulfite concentrations fig 1d f in the uv sulfite process at ph 7 0 7 8 and 35 3 of bro3ˉ were removed by sulfite alone and uv irradiation alone 120 min respectively under oxygen free conditions in contrast the reduction efficiencies of bro3ˉ were less than 1 0 and 26 2 for sulfite alone and uv irradiation alone 60 min respectively under aerobic conditions obviously under both oxygen free and aerobic conditions the reduction of bro3ˉ by sulfite was greatly enhanced due to the uv irradiation moreover the reduction kinetics of bro3ˉ in the uv sulfite process followed the pseudo first order rate law eqs 1 2 as the solution ph increased from 6 0 to 10 0 the reduction rate of bro3ˉ increased from 0 0119 to 0 0279 min 1 under oxygen free conditions while elevating from 0 0087 to 0 0171 min 1 under aerobic conditions so3 2ˉ was the main species of sulfite pk a1 1 8 and pk a2 7 2 formed at alkaline ph when the solution ph increased from 6 0 to 10 0 the fraction of so3 2ˉ increased from 5 9 to 99 8 fig s5 note that eaqˉ is mainly generated from the photolysis of so3 2ˉ 30 meanwhile the degradation rate of sulfite k sulfite also linearly increased with increasing the solution ph figs s4a and s5 which would be attributed to the increased absorbance of sulfite at 253 7 nm fig s6 therefore these results suggested that the increase of ph from 6 0 to 10 0 enhanced the photolysis of sulfite to generate more eaqˉ for the reduction of bro3ˉ 1 dt bro 3 dt k obs bro 3 2 ln bro 3 bro 3 0 k obs t compared to the removal of bro3ˉ under oxygen free conditions the increase of ph showed less positive effect on the removal rate of bro3ˉ under aerobic conditions under aerobic conditions eaqˉ could be rapidly consumed by do thus inhibiting the removal of bro3ˉ as shown in fig s4b under aerobic conditions the concentrations of sulfite showed a two stage decay kinetics a rapid decline in the first 5 0 min and a slow decay after 5 0 min the concentration of do was found to rapidly drop to below 0 20 mg l 1 in the first 5 0 min and maintain at this level till the reaction ended data not shown therefore the rapid drop of the sulfite concentration in the first 5 0 min should be mainly due to the fast reaction of do with so3 generated from the photolysis of so3 2ˉ so3 could rapidly react with do to form so5 which would further react with sulfite to generate so4 21 meanwhile sulfite could be partly oxidized to so4 2ˉ by do to confirm the formation of so3 and so4 esr spectra were collected with dmpo as a spin trap as shown in fig s7 typical dmpo ho signal was observed at only 2 0 min meanwhile dmpo so4 was not obviously observed because the rapid transformation of dmpo so4 adduct to dmpo ho adduct could occur via nucleophilic substitution by h2o oh 47 in contrast only dmpo so3 signal was observed at 5 0 min and 15 0 min moreover the signal intensity of dmpo so3 at 15 0 min was higher than that at 5 0 min these results verified that the sharp decline of do in the first 5 0 min was ascribed to the reaction of so3 with do when do was dropped to below 0 20 mg l 1 sulfite was mainly consumed by the uv photolysis thus the concentrations of sulfite decayed slowly after 5 0 min besides ph the sulfite dosage also strongly influenced the reduction efficiencies and rates of bro3ˉ in the uv sulfite process obviously increasing the sulfite dosage greatly accelerated the reduction of bro3ˉ in this process at ph 7 0 under both oxygen free and aerobic conditions fig 1d e under oxygen free conditions the pseudo first order rates of bro3ˉ reduction were determined to be 0 0126 0 0185 0 0248 and 0 0341 min 1 respectively when sulfite was dosed at 0 50 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 mm the increase of sulfite dosage could enhance the generation of eaqˉ for the reduction of bro3ˉ when the dosage of sulfite was fixed at 0 50 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 mm respectively 0 33 0 39 0 43 and 0 48 mm sulfite were consumed respectively fig s4c in contrast under aerobic conditions the reduction rates of bro3ˉ were 0 0109 0 0158 and 0 0212 min 1 respectively when sulfite was dosed at 1 0 1 5 and 2 0 mm obviously do significantly inhibited the reduction of bro3ˉ which should be ascribed to the competition of do with bro3ˉ for eaqˉ to achieve the reduction of certain amount of bro3ˉ more sulfite was consumed under aerobic conditions than that under oxygen free conditions fig s4d nevertheless an efficient reduction of bro3ˉ could be achieved by increasing the dosage of sulfite under aerobic conditions 3 1 2 humic acid since ha is ubiquitous in raw water its influence on bro3ˉ reduction in the uv sulfite process should be evaluated for application in real practice fig 2a c illustrates the effect of ha on the reduction of bro3ˉ at ph 7 0 and ph 10 0 in the uv sulfite process addition of 1 0 mg l 1 ha hardly influenced the reduction of bro3ˉ at ph 7 0 but enhanced the reduction of bro3ˉ at ph 10 0 and the reduction rate of bro3ˉ increased from 0 0185 to 0 0190 min 1 at ph 7 0 while increasing from 0 0279 to 0 0378 min 1 at ph 10 0 the enhancing effect of 1 0 mg l 1 ha at ph 10 0 should be mainly ascribed to the enhanced generation of eaqˉ from the photoionization of ha surprisingly the further increase of ha concentration from 1 0 to 5 0 mg l 1 caused a slightly negative effect on the reduction of bro3ˉ at ph 7 0 and ph 10 0 and the reduction rate of bro3ˉ decreased from 0 0185 to 0 0145 min 1 at ph 7 0 while decreasing from 0 0279 to 0 0249 min 1 at ph 10 0 the inhibiting effect of 5 0 mg l 1 ha at ph 7 0 and ph 10 0 may be because ha could scavenge eaqˉ and or compete with sulfite for protons to alleviate the yield of eaqˉ nevertheless the addition of 1 0 and 5 0 mg l 1 ha reduced the average light intensity to 95 8 and 95 6 of the incident light intensity respectively fig s8 this result indicated that the uv blocking effect of ha could be almost neglected furthermore it was worth noting that ph 10 0 seemed more favorable for the generation of eaqˉ in the presence of ha than ph 7 0 at ph 10 0 the reduction of bro3ˉ was enhanced in the presence of 1 0 mg l 1 ha meanwhile the inhibitory effect of ha on the reduction of bro3ˉ in the presence of 5 0 mg l 1 ha was mitigated at ph 10 0 compared to that at ph 7 0 ha is a macromolecular organic compound with aromatic and alicyclic rings and contains many functional groups such as carboxyl cooh 14 45 phenol ph 10 38 alcohol r oh 13 15 carbonyl c o 4 23 and methoxyl o ch3 1 5 48 it has been proposed that the promoting or inhibiting effect of ha on contaminants degradation in arps depends on the functional groups of ha 49 phenol and carboxyl groups are highly distributed in ha thus phenol pk a 9 98 50 and benzoic acid ba pk a 4 2 51 were selected as the representatives of the two functional groups respectively to further probe the effect of ha on the reduction of bro3ˉ in the uv sulfite process fig 2d f presents the effects of phenol and ba on the reduction of bro3ˉ at ph 7 0 and ph 10 0 in the uv sulfite process at ph 7 0 the reduction rate of bro3ˉ in the uv sulfite process increased from 0 0185 to 0 0273 and 0 0935 min 1 after dosing 0 10 mm phenol and ba respectively compared to the case at ph 7 0 the effects of phenol and ba on the reduction of bro3ˉ at ph 10 0 were a little complicated in the presence of phenol the concentration of bro3ˉ was almost completely exhausted in the first 30 min but increased slowly after 30 min in contrast the reduction of bro3ˉ in the presence of ba was slightly different from that in the presence of phenol it was observed that the concentration of bro3ˉ decreased by more than 95 in the first 10 min in the presence of ba nevertheless the concentration of bro3ˉ would increase from 10 to 60 min and decrease after 60 min these odd phenomena should be ascribed to the reaction of brˉ the final reduction product of bro3ˉ with the degradation products of phenol and ba more details were presented in text s3 note that the photoionization of phenol and ba could also reduce bro3ˉ in the absence of sulfite fig s10 it has been reported that phenol and ba under uv irradiation can also generate eaqˉ whose yield can be enhanced by the increase of ph fig s10 52 therefore the higher reduction efficiencies of bro3ˉ under uv irradiation in the presence of both sulfite and phenol ba would be probably attributed to a synergistic effect of sulfite and phenol ba on enhancing the yield of eaqˉ compared to that in the absence of sulfite or phenol ba the presence of phenol and ba significantly enhanced the consumption rate of sulfite in the uv sulfite process fig s11 meanwhile the consumption rate of sulfite in the presence of ba was higher than that in the presence of phenol compared with sulfite ε so 3 2 18 14 m 1 cm 1 30 phenol ε c 6 h 5 o 942 43 m 1 cm 1 50 and ba ε c 6 h 5 coo 760 0 m 1 cm 1 53 absorbed uv light more efficiently at 253 7 nm fig s12 this result indicated that the presence of phenol or ba should have decreased the consumption of sulfite by their competitive absorption for photons meanwhile in the presence of sulfite the degradation of phenol was significantly inhibited while the decay of ba was greatly accelerated fig s13 therefore these results suggested that sulfite probably played a role in transforming phenol and ba so as to maintain the fast reduction rate of bro3ˉ the similar result was also described in the sulfite iodide uv process for the degradation of monochloroacetic acid 54 phenol is irradiated by uv to generate eaqˉ and phenoxyl radical c6h5o 55 57 meanwhile ba is photoionized to produce eaqˉ and benzoyloxyl radical c6h5coo which further rapidly releases co2 to form phenyl radical c6h5 58 59 thus the retarded degradation of phenol in the presence of sulfite could be ascribed to the reduction of c6h5o by sulfite to phenol 1 0 107 m 1 s 1 60 on the other hand sulfite may rapidly react with c6h5 to generate phenyl anions c6h5 resulting in an increase in the degradation of ba in the uv sulfite process according to previous studies phenol has a higher quantum yield of eaqˉ than sulfite φ c6h5oˉ 0 25 vs φ so3 2 0 116 30 50 ba might have even a higher quantum yield of eaqˉ than phenol because eaqˉ could be further generated from the photoionization of c6h5 this could be verified by the much higher reduction rate of bro3ˉ enhanced by ba than phenol therefore as reported in the sulfite iodide uv process 54 sulfite could reduce c6h5o and c6h5 to maintain relatively high concentrations of phenol and c6h5 for an efficient and steady production of eaq moreover the photoionization of phenol and ba failed to show the correspondingly higher reduction efficiencies and rates of bro3ˉ than the uv sulfite process fig s10 note that phenol and ba have higher quantum yields of eaqˉ than sulfite thus the high reduction rate of bro3ˉ in the presence of phenol and ba might be also because sulfite could minimize the scavenging effect of c6h5o and c6h5 for eaqˉ based on all the above results it could be concluded that the functional groups of ha could influence reduction of bro3ˉ in the uv sulfite process through the enhancement of eaqˉ yield or the scavenging of eaqˉ nevertheless further investigation should be conducted to completely understand the effect of ha on the reduction of bro3ˉ in the uv sulfite process besides phenol and ba model compounds with the other functional groups e g r oh c o and o ch3 and even two or more functional groups should be selected for future study 3 1 3 anions cl and hco3 are the most common anions in natural water thus their influence on the reduction of bro3ˉ in the uv sulfite process was also evaluated as shown in fig 3 the presence of cl and hco3 had a slight influence on the reduction of bro3ˉ in the uv sulfite process the reduction rate of bro3ˉ decreased to 0 0167 min 1 and 0 0139 min 1 respectively in the presence of 2 mm and 10 mm cl meanwhile the addition of 2 mm and 10 mm hco3 decreased the reduction rate of bro3ˉ to 0 0166 min 1 and 0 0142 min 1 respectively the insignificant influence of cl and hco3 on the reduction of bro3ˉ in the uv sulfite process could be ascribed to their low reactivity toward eaqˉ 1 0 106 m 1 s 1 29 3 2 role of so3 in the uv sulfite process 3 2 1 scavenging experiments besides eaqˉ so3 also generates from uv irradiation of sulfite eaqˉ has a much more negative reduction potential than so3 and thus has been often identified as the major reactive species for the reduction of contaminants nevertheless it should be noted that so3 can donate an electron to act as a reductant thus to identify the role of so3 during the reduction of bro3ˉ no3ˉ was used as the scavenger of eaqˉ k e aq no3 9 7 109 m 1 s 1 29 61 to figure out the contribution of eaqˉ to the reduction of bro3ˉ as shown in fig 4a no3ˉ almost did not exert a negative impact on the reduction of bro3ˉ by uv irradiation alone but significantly inhibited the reduction of bro3ˉ in the uv sulfite process after the addition of no3ˉ the reduction rate of bro3ˉ by uv irradiation alone decreased from 0 0046 to 0 0042 min 1 in contrast the reduction rate of bro3ˉ in the uv sulfite process decreased from 0 0279 to 0 0107 min 1 fig s14 which indicated that no3ˉ did quench eaqˉ for the reduction of bro3ˉ nevertheless 2 0 mm no3ˉ can theoretically quench all the produced eaqˉ and totally terminate the contribution of eaqˉ to the reduction of bro3ˉ thus an incomplete inhibition on the contribution of eaqˉ in the presence of 2 0 mm no3ˉ implied that besides eaqˉ other reactive species might also play a non negligible role in the reduction of bro3ˉ note that eaqˉ and so3 are the two of reactive species generated at ph 10 0 in the uv sulfite process therefore it could be inferred that besides uv irradiation and eaqˉ so3 can also reduce bro3ˉ to confirm the role of so3 in the reduction of bro3ˉ nitrobenzene nb was selected as a contrast compound for scavenging experiments as seen from fig 4b the concentration of nb showed no change after only magnetic stirring for 45 min meaning that nb would be hardly volatile from the reaction solution under this condition nevertheless 16 7 of nb was degraded after uv irradiation alone while the degradation efficiency of nb reached 42 4 in the uv sulfite process when 1 0 mm no3ˉ was added into the uv sulfite process the degradation efficiency and kinetics of nb were almost comparable to that after uv irradiation alone these results suggested that eaqˉ was the dominant reactive species for the degradation of nb in the uv sulfite process in contrast both eaqˉ and so3 contributed to the reduction of bro3ˉ in the uv sulfite process thus the addition of 2 0 mm no3ˉ did not completely inhibit the reduction of bro3ˉ when the contribution of uv irradiation was ruled out based on the above results of the scavenging experiments using bro3ˉ and nb as the target compounds it could be further confirmed that so3 did participate in the reduction of bro3ˉ by the uv sulfite process 3 2 2 kinetic modeling the contribution of so3 to the reduction of bro3ˉ in the uv sulfite process was evidenced by the scavenging experiments to further confirm the role of so3 in the reduction of bro3ˉ a kinetic model was established as illustrated in fig 4a the reduction kinetics of bro3ˉ by uv irradiation alone and the uv sulfite process could be well fitted by the kinetic model even after the addition of 2 0 mm no3ˉ in the uv sulfite process the reduction kinetics of bro3ˉ in the first 60 min could be still well predicted by the kinetic model therefore the successful fitting of the experimental data by the kinetic model further confirmed the contribution of so3 to the reduction of bro3ˉ in the uv sulfite process 3 3 economic evaluation of the uv sulfite process for bromate removal 3 3 1 energy efficiency as shown in table s2 the uv sulfite process required lower uv fluence for bro3ˉ removal than most of uv based reduction processes this suggested that the uv sulfite process had the great potential to be applied for bro3ˉ removal in real water to examine this potential the energy efficiency of the uv sulfite process for bro3ˉ removal under both oxygen free and aerobic conditions was evaluated by ee o the detailed calculation process was summarized in text s4 as presented in fig 5 under oxygen free conditions the ee ototal value decreased from 2 8 10 2 to 4 85 10 3 kwh l 1 order 1 with increasing the dosage of sulfite from 0 50 to 2 0 mm in contrast the ee ototal value decreased from 3 78 10 2 to 1 59 10 2 kwh l 1 order 1 under aerobic conditions when the dosage of sulfite increased from 1 0 to 2 0 mm at the same sulfite dosage the ee ototal values under oxygen free conditions were smaller than that under aerobic conditions this result implied that the energy efficiency under oxygen free conditions was higher than that under aerobic conditions this is because the fraction of eaqˉ and so3 allocated for bro3ˉ removal under oxygen free conditions was higher than that under aerobic conditions in other words both sulfite the source of eaqˉ and so3 and eaqˉ were partly consumed by do under aerobic conditions nevertheless in both cases increasing the dosage of sulfite can improve the energy efficiency of the uv sulfite process for bro3ˉ removal 3 3 2 treatment cost to further evaluate the potential of the uv sulfite process for real application the treatment cost of this process for bro3ˉ removal was compared under different conditions as shown in table s3 the electricity cost of this process for bro3ˉ removal under different conditions was only 0 02 l 1 this result suggested that it was economical to apply the uv sulfite process to remove bro3ˉ in real water nevertheless it should be noted that the ee ototal values significantly increased in the presence of ha cl and hco3 with the higher concentrations this is because eaqˉ would be consumed by these species thereby decreasing the removal efficiencies of bro3ˉ in the uv sulfite process 4 conclusion the present study provided insights into bro3ˉ removal in the uv sulfite process by reinvestigating the effects of key coexisting species do ha and anions the role of so3 and the economic cost in terms of ee o and electricity cost the major conclusions could be drawn as follows 1 the reduction of bro3ˉ was significantly inhibited by do due to the rapid consumption of eaqˉ and sulfite by do nevertheless an effective reduction of bro3ˉ could be still achieved by increasing the dosage of sulfite in the presence of do 2 the effect of ha on the reduction of bro3ˉ should be mainly ascribed to the enhancement of eaqˉ yield or the scavenging of eaqˉ caused by the functional groups of ha 3 cl and hco3 had an insignificant influence on the reduction of bro3ˉ due to their low reactivity toward eaqˉ 4 although eaqˉ acted as the dominant reactive species for bro3ˉ removal so3 also contributed to the reduction of bro3ˉ 5 increasing the dosage of sulfite could improve the energy efficiency of the uv sulfite process for bro3ˉ removal under oxygen free and aerobic conditions nevertheless at the same sulfite dosage the energy efficiency under oxygen free conditions was higher than that under aerobic conditions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

composites for the exclusion of organic pollutants from aqueous system 30 considering the previously done related literature it can be concluded that it is quite a required task to design cqds modified trimetallic oxide based heterojunction that will acquire both the photo oxidation and reduction capabilities thus we here present the designing of cqds coo la2o3 nio toncs having high capability of antibiotic degradation ability 2 experimental part 2 1 synthesis microwave assisted rapid technique was used for the synthesis of carbon quantum dots cqds 24 in typical procedure 500 mg of l cysteine was dissolved in 20 ml double distilled water using vigorous stirring to this solution 1 5g of citric acid was added and then ultrasonicated for 15 min the obtained mixture was then microwave treated for 5 min after cooling down the product to room temperature naturally 15ml deionized water under agitation was added that resulted into brown colored solution at last it was centrifuged for 20 min at 8000rpm to remove the impurity and then filtered the obtained solution was extracted by ethyl acetate and then kept in refrigerator at 4 c for further use the trimetallic oxide nanocomposite of cqds coo la2o3 nio toncs was synthesized by microwave assisted reduction method 20 mm aqueous solution of lanthanum nitrate cobalt nitrate and nickel nitrate were prepared and added to the 20 ml cqd suspension containing 10 mg cqds in a conical flask the mixture was stirred for 1 h followed by the addition of 2 tri sodium citrate the obtained solution was then microwave treated for 3 min the precipitates formed were then washed several times with double distilled water and dried in hot air oven at 50 c the dried sample was then calcined at 350 c for 5 h and trimetallic oxide nanocomposite of cqds coo la2o3 nio toncs was obtained the trimetallic oxide nanoparticles coo la2o3 nio tonps were obtained using the same procedure but without the addition of cqds 2 2 characterization techniques the fourier transform infrared ftir spectra of coo la2o3 nio tonps and cqds coo la2o3 nio toncs were performed using kbr disk method in the wave number range of 4000 400 cm 1 x ray diffraction xrd analysis was used for the phase detection and was carried out in the reflectance mode λ 0 1541837 nm in the range 5 to 90 the morphological and topological imaging of the synthesized nanocomposite was obtained using electron microscopy namely scanning electron microscopy sem and transmission electron microscopy tem the absorbance spectra of the synthesized photocatalysts were obtained using uv diffuse reflectance spectra uv drs the optical studies including the band gap analysis and valence conduction edge potentials were determined using double beam uv vis spectrophotometer tauc plots were used for determining the band gap of the metal oxides and nanocomposite the electrochemical impedance spectra eis was used for determining the charge transfer ability of the photogenerated charges in the synthesized photocatalysts 2 3 photocatalytic degradation of ofl the photocatalytic efficiency of synthesized photocatalysts was determined by studying the degradation of ofloxacin ofl antibiotic in typical experiment 100 ml of 20 mg l ofl solution was prepared to which 20 mg of photocatalyst was added the degradation efficiency was studied by placing the reaction solution in a photoreactor equipped with uv and visible lamps the reaction solution was placed atleast 20 cm away from the lamp and room temperature was maintained using water circulation system attached to it the change in concentration of the ofl determined the degradation extent that was analysed using the double beam uv vis spectrophotometer at 295 nm the effect of adsorption on the overall ofl removal from the aqueous solution was also determined in the present study percent degradation or removal rate of ofl was calculated using the following equation 42 i removal or degradation c o c t c o 100 where co and ct denotes the concentration of ofl before experiment and at time t in order to determine the role of adsorption during the degradation experiments 2 different reaction conditions were examined in condition i the reaction mixture was first placed in dark for attaining adsorption desorption equilibrium and then placed in light for the degradation process however in condition ii the reaction mixture was placed directly under light irradiations in which simultaneous adsorption and degradation was carried out effect of various scavengers was also determined for evaluating the involvement of major reactive species in the ofl degradation reusability studies were performed for consecutive 6 cycles 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterization the ftir spectra of coo la2o3 nio tonps and cqds coo la2o3 nio toncs is presented in fig 1 in coo la2o3 nio tonps the characteristic peaks for coo lao and nio are observed at 724 803 and 901 cm 1 respectively 40 another peak at 3480 and 1549 cm 1 is observed for the oh stretching and bending vibrations respectively change in the peak values and intensity has been observed by the introduction of cqds in the tonps some characteristic peaks are observed for cqds at 1631 1330 and 1133 cm 1 that correspond to the stretching vibrations of co cn and co units respectively 66 the region in the range of 3000 3500 cm 1 is indicating the oh stretching vibrations 14 the xrd pattern of cqds coo la2o3 nio toncs is presented in fig 2 for la2o3 prominent peaks are observed at 19 8 27 6 29 8 39 8 47 95 56 4 and 65 8 corresponding to the diffraction planes 100 002 101 102 211 201 and 202 respectively 56 characteristic peaks for nio were observed at 2θ values of 36 23 111 42 63 200 and 62 8 220 59 however the peak at 35 98 111 and 60 74 220 marks the presence of coo phases presence in the synthesized composite 11 no characteristic peak is observed for cqds which can be due to its presence in smaller quantity as compared to the composite the morphological analysis of the synthesized composite was carried out using sem and tem and the results are shown in fig 3 a f the sem images reveal the highly agglomerated state of the composite the particles were found to be firmly attached to one another however better results were obtained in tem in which the cqds were found to be uniformly distributed in the composite in addition the agglomerated nanoparticles are visible in fig 3 d e the saed results is in accordance with the xrd results suggesting the polycrystalline nature fig 3 f the planes marked shows resemblance with the xrd pattern in addition for confirming the elemental arrangement edx spectrum was also obtained and the results are shown in fig 3 g the spectrum confirms the presence of all required elements in the cqds coo la2o3 nio toncs 3 2 optical analysis in order to check the photoactivity of synthesized photocatalysts uv drs analysis was used results presented in fig 4 a show that la2o3 nio and coo showed absorbance in the visible region with maximum at 427 449 and 462 nm respectively the absorbance of coo la2o3 nio tonps is found to be maximum in the visible region also the combination of 3 metal oxides helped appreciably in improving the light absorption ability further the introduction of cqds to the trimetallic oxide nanoparticles further improved the absorbance and it exhibited activity in the complete visible region 65 afterwards the band gap energies of for la2o3 nio and coo were calculated using tauc plots with graph plotted between hν versus αhν 2 39 the band gap energies obtained for la2o3 nio and coo are 2 91 2 76 and 2 68 ev respectively the synergistic effect between the three photocatalysts and cqds helped in improving the light harvesting proficiency of the synthesized cqds coo la2o3 nio toncs the corresponding valence band energy evb and conduction band energy ecb were calculated using the following equations ii e vb x 4 5 0 5 e g iii e cb e vb e g where eg represent the band gap of the semiconductor and x denotes the pearson electronegativity value the evb values calculated for la2o3 nio and coo using equation ii were 2 235 2 639 and 2 534 ev respectively corresponding ecb values were 0 675 0 121 and 0 146 ev respectively the obtained optical results for the 3 photocatalysts are presented in table 1 and their respective band structure are given in fig 4 e 3 3 bet and eis study major factors that greatly influence the photoefficiency of the photocatalysts includes light harvesting ability photogenerated charges production adsorption proficiency charge separation low recombination and high charge transportation fig 5 a shows the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm for cqds coo la2o3 nio toncs the surface area was found to 22 68 be m2 g and isotherm exhibited the typical characteristics of type iv isotherm generally larger the surface area higher will be the exposed active sites and as a result higher will be the removal efficiency results exhibited the high surface area of cqds coo la2o3 nio toncs that could be linked to the nano size of the constituting metal oxides and the presence of cqds the electrochemical impedance spectra eis was obtained for determining the charge transfer rate which can be determined by the size of the arc produced smaller the arc formed higher will be the charge transfer rate and vice versa results presented in fig 5 b shows that the best results were obtained in case of cqds coo la2o3 nio toncs followed by coo la2o3 nio la2o3 nio and coo 3 4 photoefficiency of cqds coo la2o3 nio toncs for degradation of ofloxacin ofloxacin is a highly consumed antibiotic and is used as a model pollutant in the present study its chemical structure is given in fig 6 a time dependent uv vis spectrum presented in fig 6 b shows that the maximum absorbance at 295 nm the corresponding signal got constantly decreased with the passage of time indicating the removal of ofl molecules fig 6 c shows the extent of ofl degradation using la2o3 nio coo la2o3 nio coo and cqds coo la2o3 nio toncs corresponding results obtained showed that the degradation rate of the photocatalysts followed the order cqds coo la 2 o 3 nio toncs 91 24 coo la 2 o 3 nio tonps 69 70 la 2 o 3 34 63 nio 27 72 coo 17 45 improved degradation rate in case of cqds coo la2o3 nio toncs can probably be linked to the synergistic effect between the constituting units and low recombination rate of photogenerated charges corresponding kinetic study showed that the degradation experiments followed pseudo first order kinetics and the linear plots are shown in fig 6 d the rate constants obtained followed the following order cqds coo la2o3 nio toncs 0 036 min 1 coo la2o3 nio tonps 0 018 min 1 la2o3 0 007 min 1 nio 0 005 min 1 coo 0 003 min 1 the cqds coo la2o3 nio toncs degradation rate was found to be 12 times better than that of coo and around 7 2 times better than nio in addition plain photolysis results showed insignificant rate indicating that ofl has insignificant self degradation proficiency or it is quite stable in nature the influence of photocatalyst dose on the ofl degradation rate was studied in the range of 10 50 mg and the results are shown in fig 6 e amount of photocatalyst in the reaction mixture determine the extent of available active sites in the present study maximum degradation rate was obtained with 20 mg and further increase in the photocatalyst dose decreased the degradation rate with 20 mg dose the reaction mixture obtained a best dose and ofl concentration ratio however any further increase above 20 mg decreased the degradation rate due to hindrance in light penetration due to higher concentration of photocatalyst in addition it can also lead to aggregation of particles in the solution afterwards the adsorption activity of cqds coo la2o3 nio toncs was also tested for 60 min adsorption plays a very critical role during the photocatalysis as it determines the extent of interaction that could take place between the pollutant molecules and the photocatalyst surface results presented in fig 6 f shows that maximum of 29 adsorption after 60 min adsorption activity of cqds coo la2o3 nio toncs can be linked to its high surface area the ofl degradation activity of cqds coo la2o3 nio toncs was also tested under direct sunlight irradiation too natural sunlight irradiations comprise of uv and visible region and these experiments depends strongly upon the light intensity the experiments were performed for 60 min 20 mg photocatalyst dose and 20 mg l ofl concentration results presented in fig 6 g shows that maximum of 80 ofl was degraded within 60 min comparatively reduced rate was obtained which can be linked to the variation in the intensity of light irradiation however it still maintained quite an appreciable degradation rate furthermore the ofl degradation experiments were performed under 2 reaction conditions results shown in fig 6 h shows that higher degradation rate was obtained in condition ii as compared to condition i in condition i most of the active sites on the photocatalyst surface may be occupied during the initial dark period as a results there would be less production of reactive radicals on the surface consequently leading to decreased ofl removal rate however in condition i as soon as the ofl molecules get adsorbed on the surface they get readily degraded in this reaction mixture simultaneous adsorption and degradation of ofl molecules took place thus higher removal rate was obtained corresponding kinetic plots showed in fig 6 i indicating the better fit of pseudo first kinetic model with rate constants obtained are 0 027 min 1 for condition i and 0 037 min 1 for condition ii complete degradation mechanism can be generalized by the equations iv ix presented below iv cqds coo la 2 o 3 nio hν cqds coo la 2 o 3 nio h vb cqds coo la 2 o 3 nio e cb v cqds coo la 2 o 3 nio ofl

products free cqds coo la 2 o 3 nio toncs for reuse ix o 2 ofl adsorbed cqds coo la 2 o 3 nio toncs intermediate product degraded product free cqds coo la 2 o 3 nio further for generalising the overall better performance of the synthesized cqds coo la2o3 nio toncs a comparison with other photocatalysts reported in literature was done and results are presented in table 2 3 5 trapping study and degradation pathways to determine the possibility of involvement of reactive species in the degradation experiments trapping study was undertaken using various scavengers such as isopropanol ip benzoquinone bzq and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta that scavenge the activity of hydroxyl radicals oh superoxide radicals o2 and holes h 18 during any photocatalytic degradation experiment various types of reactive radicals are produced and scavengers are used for trapping such radicals and this study helps in signifying the involvement of the type of radicals fig 7 a shows that the degradation rate decreased significantly after the addition of ip while no significant rate change was observed during the addition of edta suggesting the involvement of oh in addition superoxide radicals were also involved as evident from the decreased degradation rate for further clarifying the involvement of hydroxyl radicals terephthalic acid method tpa was employed the corresponding reaction involved in this method is 31 tpa is an organic compound that under the attack of hydroxyl radicals produce highly fluorescent 2 hydroxyterephthalic acid which gives a sharp absorbance peak at 425 nm fig 7 b shows that the peak intensity at 425 nm increased with the increase in time suggesting the increase in production of oh radicals and consequently increase in concentration of 2 hydroxyterephthalic acid in the solution for elaborating the practical applicability of synthesized cqds coo la2o3 nio toncs reusability study was conducted for consecutive 6 cycles the degradation of ofl was studied and results presented in fig 7 c shows that toncs maintained an appreciable ofl degradation extent of 87 even after 6 cycles however the slight decrease in the rate could be attributed to the blockage of active sites of toncs that resulted in decreased production of reactive radicals involved in ofl degradation another probable reason could be the loss of the photocatalyst after each experiment during isolation from the previous experiment 1 based on the radical trapping experiments a reasonable mechanism for the reactive radical generation and degradation of ofl can be proposed and is presented in fig 7 d considering the band structure of the constituting photocatalysts they were arranged in staggered form with the possibility of charge transfer in the type ii and direct z scheme fashion considering the type ii mechanism under light irradiation charge transfer occurs along the valence bands vb and conduction bands cb of different photocatalysts electron transfer occurred between cb of coo la2o3 and nio and maximum got concentrated onto nio with potential 0 121 v the minimum potential required for o2 radicals production is 0 33 v which indicates the incapability of the composite to form o2 radicals on the other hand hole transfer occurred between the vb of coo la2o3 and nio and got accumulated onto la2o3 having potential 2 235 v the formation of oh radicals is bit possible in this case as 1 99 v potential is required for oh radicals production from hydroxide ions in z scheme under the irradiation of light source excitation of electrons produced photogenerated charges considering the high affinity of electrons for holes the recombination will take place between the cb of nio and coo and vb of la2o3 the photogenerated electrons in the cb of la2o3 with potential 0 675 ev will be transferred to the cqds that will reduce the chances of back transfer in this way the photogenerated electrons with high potential will be free and would be utilized for the production of o2 radicals however the photogenerated holes freely available in the vb of nio and coo would be utilized for the production of oh radicals the produced oh and o2 radicals can efficiently participate in the ofl degradation to improve the photoefficiency of cqds coo la2o3 nio toncs thus considering the charge transfer followed in the 2 schemes z scheme is found to be the better one which is in high accordance with the radical trapping experiments too in the synthesized cqds coo la2o3 nio toncs cqds played some very crucial roles firstly it improved the light harvesting ability with considerable red shift in the wavelength as proved by uv drs study secondly it helped in reducing the extent of agglomeration between the metal oxide nanoparticles thirdly it helped in improving the charge transfer rate and thus ultimately improved the photocatalytic efficiency also all the 4 components of the toncs were complementary to each other and helped in enhancing the ofl degradation extent 3 6 possible ofl degradation mechanism according to the above mentioned results a possible ofl photocatalytic degradation mechanism was formulated and is shown in fig 8 the iupac names and the respective m z values of each intermediate is given in table 3 major mechanisms involved in ofl degradation were radical attack hydroxylation and ring opening 52 herein the degradation of ofl started with the hydroxylation on the tetrahydropyridine ring further ring cleavage occurred at the c 8 atoms leading to formation of product with m z 397 further attack by the radicals results in cc bond breakage between co and benzene ring and formed products with m z 117 and 282 thereafter ring opening reactions dominated and formed products with m z values 165 and 87 the smaller structures formed can easily be mineralized to co2 and h2o 4 conclusions in summary we have synthesized trimetallic oxide nanocomposite cqds coo la2o3 nio toncs using microwave assisted reduction method it was utilized as an efficient photocatalyst for the degradation of ofl and maximum rate obtained was 93 8 in 75 min which was quite high as compared to the pristine units the enhanced degradation rate obtained was attributed to the synergistic effect between the constituting metal oxides and cqds the addition of cqds helped in improving the light harvesting range and reducing the probability of back reactions the trapping studies revealed the involvement of hydroxyl and superoxide radicals in ofl degradation experiments also confirmed that the adsorption too played a crucial role in the ofl removal the charge transfer between the constituting units confirmed the z scheme mechanism it was found to be highly reusable in nature upto 6 cycles hence the present work provides an insight for the fabrication of visible light driven metal oxide based photocatalysts and their application for the removal of ofl declaration of competing interest the authors

photocatalysts were obtained using uv diffuse reflectance spectra uv drs the optical studies including the band gap analysis and valence conduction edge potentials were determined using double beam uv vis spectrophotometer tauc plots were used for determining the band gap of the metal oxides and nanocomposite the electrochemical impedance spectra eis was used for determining the charge transfer ability of the photogenerated charges in the synthesized photocatalysts 2 3 photocatalytic degradation of ofl the photocatalytic efficiency of synthesized photocatalysts was determined by studying the degradation of ofloxacin ofl antibiotic in typical experiment 100 ml of 20 mg l ofl solution was prepared to which 20 mg of photocatalyst was added the degradation efficiency was studied by placing the reaction solution in a photoreactor equipped with uv and visible lamps the reaction solution was placed atleast 20 cm away from the lamp and room temperature was maintained using water circulation system attached to it the change in concentration of the ofl determined the degradation extent that was analysed using the double beam uv vis spectrophotometer at 295 nm the effect of adsorption on the overall ofl removal from the aqueous solution was also determined in the present study percent degradation or removal rate of ofl was calculated using the following equation 42 i removal or degradation c o c t c o 100 where co and ct denotes the concentration of ofl before experiment and at time t in order to determine the role of adsorption during the degradation experiments 2 different reaction conditions were examined in condition i the reaction mixture was first placed in dark for attaining adsorption desorption equilibrium and then placed in light for the degradation process however in condition ii the reaction mixture was placed directly under light irradiations in which simultaneous adsorption and degradation was carried out effect of various scavengers was also determined for evaluating the involvement of major reactive species in the ofl degradation reusability studies were performed for consecutive 6 cycles 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterization the ftir spectra of coo la2o3 nio tonps and cqds coo la2o3 nio toncs is presented in fig 1 in coo la2o3 nio tonps the characteristic peaks for coo lao and nio are observed at 724 803 and 901 cm 1 respectively 40 another peak at 3480 and 1549 cm 1 is observed for the oh stretching and bending vibrations respectively change in the peak values and intensity has been observed by the introduction of cqds in the tonps some characteristic peaks are observed for cqds at 1631 1330 and 1133 cm 1 that correspond to the stretching vibrations of co cn and co units respectively 66 the region in the range of 3000 3500 cm 1 is indicating the oh stretching vibrations 14 the xrd pattern of cqds coo la2o3 nio toncs is presented in fig 2 for la2o3 prominent peaks are observed at 19 8 27 6 29 8 39 8 47 95 56 4 and 65 8 corresponding to the diffraction planes 100 002 101 102 211 201 and 202 respectively 56 characteristic peaks for nio were observed at 2θ values of 36 23 111 42 63 200 and 62 8 220 59 however the peak at 35 98 111 and 60 74 220 marks the presence of coo phases presence in the synthesized composite 11 no characteristic peak is observed for cqds which can be due to its presence in smaller quantity as compared to the composite the morphological analysis of the synthesized composite was carried out using sem and tem and the results are shown in fig 3 a f the sem images reveal the highly agglomerated state of the composite the particles were found to be firmly attached to one another however better results were obtained in tem in which the cqds were found to be uniformly distributed in the composite in addition the agglomerated nanoparticles are visible in fig 3 d e the saed results is in accordance with the xrd results suggesting the polycrystalline nature fig 3 f the planes marked shows resemblance with the xrd pattern in addition for confirming the elemental arrangement edx spectrum was also obtained and the results are shown in fig 3 g the spectrum confirms the presence of all required elements in the cqds coo la2o3 nio toncs 3 2 optical analysis in order to check the photoactivity of synthesized photocatalysts uv drs analysis was used results presented in fig 4 a show that la2o3 nio and coo showed absorbance in the visible region with maximum at 427 449 and 462 nm respectively the absorbance of coo la2o3 nio tonps is found to be maximum in the visible region also the combination of 3 metal oxides helped appreciably in improving the light absorption ability further the introduction of cqds to the trimetallic oxide nanoparticles further improved the absorbance and it exhibited activity in the complete visible region 65 afterwards the band gap energies of for la2o3 nio and coo were calculated using tauc plots with graph plotted between hν versus αhν 2 39 the band gap energies obtained for la2o3 nio and coo are 2 91 2 76 and 2 68 ev respectively the synergistic effect between the three photocatalysts and cqds helped in improving the light harvesting proficiency of the synthesized cqds coo la2o3 nio toncs the corresponding valence band energy evb and conduction band energy ecb were calculated using the following equations ii e vb x 4 5 0 5 e g iii e cb e vb e g where eg represent the band gap of the semiconductor and x denotes the pearson electronegativity value the evb values calculated for la2o3 nio and coo using equation ii were 2 235 2 639 and 2 534 ev respectively corresponding ecb values were 0 675 0 121 and 0 146 ev respectively the obtained optical results for the 3 photocatalysts are presented in table 1 and their respective band structure are given in fig 4 e 3 3 bet and eis study major factors that greatly influence the photoefficiency of the photocatalysts includes light harvesting ability photogenerated charges production adsorption proficiency charge separation low recombination and high charge transportation fig 5 a shows the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm for cqds coo la2o3 nio toncs the surface area was found to 22 68 be m2 g and isotherm exhibited the typical characteristics of type iv isotherm generally larger the surface area higher will be the exposed active sites and as a result higher will be the removal efficiency results exhibited the high surface area of cqds coo la2o3 nio toncs that could be linked to the nano size of the constituting metal oxides and the presence of cqds the electrochemical impedance spectra eis was obtained for determining the charge transfer rate which can be determined by the size of the arc produced smaller the arc formed higher will be the charge transfer rate and vice versa results presented in fig 5 b shows that the best results were obtained in case of cqds coo la2o3 nio toncs followed by coo la2o3 nio la2o3 nio and coo 3 4 photoefficiency of cqds coo la2o3 nio toncs for degradation of ofloxacin ofloxacin is a highly consumed antibiotic and is used as a model pollutant in the present study its chemical structure is given in fig 6 a time dependent uv vis spectrum presented in fig 6 b shows that the maximum absorbance at 295 nm the corresponding signal got constantly decreased with the passage of time indicating the removal of ofl molecules fig 6 c shows the extent of ofl degradation using la2o3 nio coo la2o3 nio coo and cqds coo la2o3 nio toncs corresponding results obtained showed that the degradation rate of the photocatalysts followed the order cqds coo la 2 o 3 nio toncs 91 24 coo la 2 o 3 nio tonps 69 70 la 2 o 3 34 63 nio 27 72 coo 17 45 improved degradation rate in case of cqds coo la2o3 nio toncs can probably be linked to the synergistic effect between the constituting units and low recombination rate of photogenerated charges corresponding kinetic study showed that the degradation experiments followed pseudo first order kinetics and the linear plots are shown in fig 6 d the rate constants obtained followed the following order cqds coo la2o3 nio toncs 0 036 min 1 coo la2o3 nio tonps 0 018 min 1 la2o3 0 007 min 1 nio 0 005 min 1 coo 0 003 min 1 the cqds coo la2o3 nio toncs degradation rate was found to be 12 times better than that of coo and around 7 2 times better than nio in addition plain photolysis results showed insignificant rate indicating that ofl has insignificant self degradation proficiency or it is quite stable in nature the influence of photocatalyst dose on the ofl degradation rate was studied in the range of 10 50 mg and the results are shown in fig 6 e amount of photocatalyst in the reaction mixture determine the extent of available active sites in the present study maximum degradation rate was obtained with 20 mg and further increase in the photocatalyst dose decreased the degradation rate with 20 mg dose the reaction mixture obtained a best dose and ofl concentration ratio however any further increase above 20 mg decreased the degradation rate due to hindrance in light penetration due to higher concentration of photocatalyst in addition it can also lead to aggregation of particles in the solution afterwards the adsorption activity of cqds coo la2o3 nio toncs was also tested for 60 min adsorption plays a very critical role during the photocatalysis as it determines the extent of interaction that could take place between the pollutant molecules and the photocatalyst surface results presented in fig 6 f shows that maximum of 29 adsorption after 60 min adsorption activity of cqds coo la2o3 nio toncs can be linked to its high surface area the ofl degradation activity of cqds coo la2o3 nio toncs was also tested under direct sunlight irradiation too natural sunlight irradiations comprise of uv and visible region and these experiments depends strongly upon the light intensity the experiments were performed for 60 min 20 mg photocatalyst dose and 20 mg l ofl concentration results presented in fig 6 g shows that maximum of 80 ofl was degraded within 60 min comparatively reduced rate was obtained which can be linked to the variation in the intensity of light irradiation however it still maintained quite an appreciable degradation rate furthermore the ofl degradation experiments were performed under 2 reaction conditions results shown in fig 6 h shows that higher degradation rate was obtained in condition ii as compared to condition i in condition i most of the active sites on the photocatalyst surface may be occupied during the initial dark period as a results there would be less production of reactive radicals on the surface consequently leading to decreased ofl removal rate however in condition i as soon as the ofl molecules get adsorbed on the surface they get readily degraded in this reaction mixture simultaneous adsorption and degradation of ofl molecules took place thus higher removal rate was obtained corresponding kinetic plots showed in fig 6 i indicating the better fit of pseudo first kinetic model with rate constants obtained are 0 027 min 1 for condition i and 0 037 min 1 for condition ii complete degradation mechanism can be generalized by the equations iv ix presented below iv cqds coo la 2 o 3 nio hν cqds coo la 2 o 3 nio h vb cqds coo la 2 o 3 nio e cb v cqds coo la 2 o 3 nio ofl

products free cqds coo la 2 o 3 nio toncs for reuse ix o 2 ofl adsorbed cqds coo la 2 o 3 nio toncs intermediate product degraded product free cqds coo la 2 o 3 nio further for generalising the overall better performance of the synthesized cqds coo la2o3 nio toncs a comparison with other photocatalysts reported in literature was done and results are presented in table 2 3 5 trapping study and degradation pathways to determine the possibility of involvement of reactive species in the degradation experiments trapping study was undertaken using various scavengers such as isopropanol ip benzoquinone bzq and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta that scavenge the activity of hydroxyl radicals oh superoxide radicals o2 and holes h 18 during any photocatalytic degradation experiment various types of reactive radicals are produced and scavengers are used for trapping such radicals and this study helps in signifying the involvement of the type of radicals fig 7 a shows that the degradation rate decreased significantly after the addition of ip while no significant rate change was observed during the addition of edta suggesting the involvement of oh in addition superoxide radicals were also involved as evident from the decreased degradation rate for further clarifying the involvement of hydroxyl radicals terephthalic acid method tpa was employed the corresponding reaction involved in this method is 31 tpa is an organic compound that under the attack of hydroxyl radicals produce highly fluorescent 2 hydroxyterephthalic acid which gives a sharp absorbance peak at 425 nm fig 7 b shows that the peak intensity at 425 nm increased with the increase in time suggesting the increase in production of oh radicals and consequently increase in concentration of 2 hydroxyterephthalic acid in the solution for elaborating the practical applicability of synthesized cqds coo la2o3 nio toncs reusability study was conducted for consecutive 6 cycles the degradation of ofl was studied and results presented in fig 7 c shows that toncs maintained an appreciable ofl degradation extent of 87 even after 6 cycles however the slight decrease in the rate could be attributed to the blockage of active sites of toncs that resulted in decreased production of reactive radicals involved in ofl degradation another probable reason could be the loss of the photocatalyst after each experiment during isolation from the previous experiment 1 based on the radical trapping experiments a reasonable mechanism for the reactive radical generation and degradation of ofl can be proposed and is presented in fig 7 d considering the band structure of the constituting photocatalysts they were arranged in staggered form with the possibility of charge transfer in the type ii and direct z scheme fashion considering the type ii mechanism under light irradiation charge transfer occurs along the valence bands vb and conduction bands cb of different photocatalysts electron transfer occurred between cb of coo la2o3 and nio and maximum got concentrated onto nio with potential 0 121 v the minimum potential required for o2 radicals production is 0 33 v which indicates the incapability of the composite to form o2 radicals on the other hand hole transfer occurred between the vb of coo la2o3 and nio and got accumulated onto la2o3 having potential 2 235 v the formation of oh radicals is bit possible in this case as 1 99 v potential is required for oh radicals production from hydroxide ions in z scheme under the irradiation of light source excitation of electrons produced photogenerated charges considering the high affinity of electrons for holes the recombination will take place between the cb of nio and coo and vb of la2o3 the photogenerated electrons in the cb of la2o3 with potential 0 675 ev will be transferred to the cqds that will reduce the chances of back transfer in this way the photogenerated electrons with high potential will be free and would be utilized for the production of o2 radicals however the photogenerated holes freely available in the vb of nio and coo would be utilized for the production of oh radicals the produced oh and o2 radicals can efficiently participate in the ofl degradation to improve the photoefficiency of cqds coo la2o3 nio toncs thus considering the charge transfer followed in the 2 schemes z scheme is found to be the better one which is in high accordance with the radical trapping experiments too in the synthesized cqds coo la2o3 nio toncs cqds played some very crucial roles firstly it improved the light harvesting ability with considerable red shift in the wavelength as proved by uv drs study secondly it helped in reducing the extent of agglomeration between the metal oxide nanoparticles thirdly it helped in improving the charge transfer rate and thus ultimately improved the photocatalytic efficiency also all the 4 components of the toncs were complementary to each other and helped in enhancing the ofl degradation extent 3 6 possible ofl degradation mechanism according to the above mentioned results a possible ofl photocatalytic degradation mechanism was formulated and is shown in fig 8 the iupac names and the respective m z values of each intermediate is given in table 3 major mechanisms involved in ofl degradation were radical attack hydroxylation and ring opening 52 herein the degradation of ofl started with the hydroxylation on the tetrahydropyridine ring further ring cleavage occurred at the c 8 atoms leading to formation of product with m z 397 further attack by the radicals results in cc bond breakage between co and benzene ring and formed products with m z 117 and 282 thereafter ring opening reactions dominated and formed products with m z values 165 and 87 the smaller structures formed can easily be mineralized to co2 and h2o 4 conclusions in summary we have synthesized trimetallic oxide nanocomposite cqds coo la2o3 nio toncs using microwave assisted reduction method it was utilized as an efficient photocatalyst for the degradation of ofl and maximum rate obtained was 93 8 in 75 min which was quite high as compared to the pristine units the enhanced degradation rate obtained was attributed to the synergistic effect between the constituting metal oxides and cqds the addition of cqds helped in improving the light harvesting range and reducing the probability of back reactions the trapping studies revealed the involvement of hydroxyl and superoxide radicals in ofl degradation experiments also confirmed that the adsorption too played a crucial role in the ofl removal the charge transfer between the constituting units confirmed the z scheme mechanism it was found to be highly reusable in nature upto 6 cycles hence the present work provides an insight for the fabrication of visible light driven metal oxide based photocatalysts and their application for the removal of ofl declaration of competing interest the authors
