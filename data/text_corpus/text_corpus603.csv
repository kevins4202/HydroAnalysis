of density difference on the wave pumping groundwater flow is neglected since the variations of salinity and or density of pore water in the subtidal sediments are usually negligible the origin of the z axis is at the interface of seawater and sediments the positive z direction is upward the x axis is positive seaward according to above mentioned assumptions and the aquifer system theories e g jiao and tang 1999 li and chen 1991 taking loading effect of seawater weight overlying the seabed into account then the governing equation for the two dimensional groundwater flow in the porous seabed can be written as 1 k x 2 h x 2 k z 2 h z 2 s s h t s s l e d h wave dt where h x z t and h wave x t are the hydraulic heads l of pore water and seawater respectively k x and k z are the horizontal and

the thickness of the permeable sediments in order to obtain analytical solution the function h x z t is assumed to be periodic with respect to the time t and horizontal location x these assumptions are used to replace the initial condition for time and boundary condition for x and imply that the aquifer extends horizontally infinitely 2 2 analytical solution for water head in aquifer according

the analytical solution it is assumed that the subtidal aquifer extends horizontally infinitely to examine the reasonability of this assumption numerical simulations with modeling domains of finite horizontal extension length was conducted and compared with the analytical solutions in this section the finite element numerical model marun marine unsaturated boufadel et al 1999b was used to obtain numerical solutions triangular finite elements were used for spatial discretization by the standard galerkin method huyakorn and pinder 1983 and mass lumping was employed for time integration celia et al 1990 as a two dimensional density dependent model which can simulate groundwater flow and solute transport in variably saturated porous media it has been verified by reproducing previous well known numerical results such as henry s problem of seawater intrusion boufadel et al 1999a and the elder problem boufadel et al 1999b elder 1967 in the designed model the wave loading effect was incorporated and the density difference was ignored following the basic assumption for the analytical solution 3 1 1 domain setup the domain for numerical simulations is a rectangle opqr as shown in fig 1 its horizontal length is 420 m and vertical height is 2 75 m representative value in table 1 the origin of the coordinates 0 0 was located at the top left corner of the model domain point o the domain was discretized into a mesh of 211 41 8651 nodes and 16 800 triangular elements with equal mesh spacing of 2 m in the horizontal direction and 0 07 m in the vertical direction 3 1 2 boundary and initial conditions the finite domain opqr was used for numerical simulations see fig 1 no flow boundary conditions were assigned on both sides and the bottom op qr and pq on the seabed boundary or a dirichlet boundary condition was applied based on the eq 3 the initial pressure head was approximated by the analytical solution at t 0 the model was run for 1 h with a time step was 0 05 s to obtain a periodical numerical solution until the difference of the pressure head between two successive wave cycles became negligible the periodical results were then used to compare with the analytical solution the parameter values used for the aquifer and wave properties are shown in table 1 3 2 numerical results fig 2 compared the time series of numerical and analytical results at three points left middle and right on the bottom of the domain during two wave cycles we can define the relative error i e the ratio of the difference between the analytical and the numerical results to the wave amplitude to examine the validity of the analytical solutions the relative error at left and right boundaries and the middle of the model domain were 0 52 0 49 and 0 11 respectively these small relative errors justified the assumption for the analytical solution that the permeable and impermeable layers extend horizontally infinitely at the middle of the model domain the analytical solution matched very well with the numerical result which manifested that the analytical solutions have acceptable accuracy in predicting the wave pumping head fluctuation with loading effect 4 discussion and sensitivity analyses of the analytical solution three important model parameters are involved in eq 10a which are the dimensionless thickness ad the dimensionless wave sediment parameter σ and loading efficiency le respectively it is important to determine the value ranges of these three parameters in specific coastal seabed systems to this end the values of le ad and σ corresponding to some case studies are calculated and will be applied in the following discussion for those who are listed in table 1 4 1 amplitude ratio and phase shift based on eqs 5 and 6a the amplitude ratio of water head is calculated for different combinations of l e ad and σ fig 3 overall the amplitude ratio increases with l e the larger σ is the more rapidly the amplitude ratio increases with l e when le 0 the amplitude ratio decreased exponentially with increasing ad and finally close to zero this means that the wave energy is dissipated when the wave propagates downward when le 0 the amplitude ratio decreased relatively slow with ad and then stayed constant at a value larger than zero it shows that the loading effect can cause the head to fluctuate with the same amplitude in the areas where propagated wave energy is totally dissipated in these areas head fluctuates as the pore space contracts and expands with wave fluctuations the loading effect can also slightly slow down the dissipation of wave because the slope of the amplitude ratio decreasing with ad is reduced when le 0 and σ 0 1 the change of amplitude ratio with thickness ad has some slightly different features namely these curves first decrease then increase and ultimately remain stable this bending part in the exponentially decay curves is because the reduced wave amplitude during wave propagation is encountered and superposed with background head fluctuation based on the assumption of linear porosity elasticity mei and foda 1981 coupled a set of the linearized governing equations to wave induced responses in a fluid filled porosity elastic solid with a free surface which showed the pore pressure response of a porosity elastic layer of finite depth to sea waves it has been revealed that for fine sand the pore pressure amplitude ratio diminished rapidly with increasing depth to a constant value with a bending very similar to the graph of l e 1 and σ 1 in this study from this perspective the reasonability of the analytical solution for water head fluctuation was verified to some extent the phase shift ψ of water head fluctuation in the sediment is calculated based on eqs 6a and 6b and presented in fig 4 in our analytical equations we set the upper wave boundary to change with time and space groundwater under a wave crest flows toward adjacent seabed under two troughs the divergent line to separate the two flow cells may be not vertical when le 0 the water head fluctuation lags behind the wave and the phase shift increase with increasing thickness the hysteresis cycle grew with increasing thickness and then these negative phase shifts all can be transferred to positive values since it can be interpreted that the water head fluctuation lags a basic phase value and random numbers of wave cycles when le 0 the loading effect causes the head fluctuations ahead of the wave one fact is noteworthy that the value of le can change the increasing rate of phase shift with thickness but the stabilized phase shift with thickness is independent of le however when le 0 5 the phase shift ψ first increases towards the positive axis until reaching a maximum value and then it decreases to a negative value with the increase of thickness and finally remains constant there it shows that the presence of the loading effect can change the phase shift of head fluctuation in a more complicated way 4 2 exchange capacity across the interface fig 5 shows the changes of sgd q m d with sediment thickness d m for different loading efficiency le wave parameters and hydraulic conductivities values are based on the representative values in table 1 since specific storage s s depends on the same parameters as loading efficiency le we set five different values of loading efficiency to represent five types of the solid medium one can see that sgd increases rapidly with increasing d then to a constant value the thickness of a groundwater cross section increases with the increment of d which permits more water to flow through the pore space under a wave crest is compacted and pore water is squeezed out while under a wave trough the pore space is expanded and groundwater fills in sgd q decreases monotonously with increasing l e stresses applied to a saturated porous medium are partly distributed to the solid skeleton and partly to the pore fluid the former stresses are responsible for skeletal deformations which explains why it is called effective stress it should be clarified that the compressibility of sediments mainly stems from rearrangement of the particles instead of compressibility of soil grains in response to a change in pressure the rearrangement of the particles results in a significant enhancement in the pore water pressure and a reduction in pressure gradients that is the reason for pressure gradients to be attenuated in compressible porous medium the loading efficiency is positively correlated with the compressibility of the porous medium and however due to the reduction of pressure gradients the capacity of sediment to squeeze water is in negative correlation to l e fig 6 shows how dimensionless outflow rate q 0 changes with the dimensionless wave sediment parameter σ for different loading efficiency le when ad 0 4 1 5 244 1 the values of ad were selected according to quartiles based on its value range in table 1 the dimensionless outflow rate q 0 decreases with increasing l e when σ 5 the difference in q 0 for different le is diminished when σ 5 it shows that q 0 is almost constant when σ is small then increases dramatically with σ when σ gets large dimensionless parameter σ is influenced by the combined effect of wave climate and sediment properties 5 conclusions this paper revealed the influence of poro elastic property of sediment on the hydrodynamic process within the permeable seabed a typical flat seabed unit was selected to investigate the wave pumping seawater groundwater circulation process using analytical models on the one hand wave motions triggered a pressure difference between seawater and pore water and ultimately increased the advective seawater groundwater circulation on the other hand wave induced changing seawater depth and weight had a loading effect on compressible aquifer skeleton and pore water which conversely weakened the pressure difference when the wave climbed up increasing wave gravity pressed the skeleton and pore water pressure raised in fact it lowered the pressure gradients between the wave crest and pore water when wave dropped down elastic soil skeleton recovered from deformation due to a decrease of wave gravity contrary to the response to wave crest pore water pressure under a wave trough dropped down so that the pressure difference between pore water and seawater was lowered the loading effect on the hydrodynamic process mainly functioned on heightening the amplitude of water head variation and weakening efflux and influx rates by lowering the pressure gradients the analytical solution can be employed to estimate aquifer parameters such as specific storage and horizontal hydraulic conductivity the applicability of the solution was demonstrated by investigating the water head fluctuation the amplitude ratio of groundwater head fluctuation in marine sediment decreased exponentially with the aquifer thickness and then stayed constant at a value larger than zero when considering wave loading and the decay rate decreased with increasing loading efficiency the loading effect caused the head fluctuations ahead of the wave the value of loading efficiency can change the increasing rate of phase shift with thickness but the stabilized phase shift with thickness was independent of loading efficiency wave induced sgd generally increased with the aquifer s thickness permeability wavenumber wave period and decreased with the loading efficiency and specific storage of the aquifer wave induced sgd across permeable marine sediments is ubiquitous in the coastal environment its biogeochemistry is strongly coupled to the hydrodynamic process above and within the sediments solute transports into and out of the sediments are significantly impacted by advective pore water exchange between the sediment and water column credit authorship contribution statement shengchao yu conceptualization methodology software

are used to replace the initial condition for time and boundary condition for x and imply that the aquifer extends horizontally infinitely 2 2 analytical solution for water head in aquifer according

the analytical solution it is assumed that the subtidal aquifer extends horizontally infinitely to examine the reasonability of this assumption numerical simulations with modeling domains of finite horizontal extension length was conducted and compared with the analytical solutions in this section the finite element numerical model marun marine unsaturated boufadel et al 1999b was used to obtain numerical solutions triangular finite elements were used for spatial discretization by the standard galerkin method huyakorn and pinder 1983 and mass lumping was employed for time integration celia et al 1990 as a two dimensional density dependent model which can simulate groundwater flow and solute transport in variably saturated porous media it has been verified by reproducing previous well known numerical results such as henry s problem of seawater intrusion boufadel et al 1999a and the elder problem boufadel et al 1999b elder 1967 in the designed model the wave loading effect was incorporated and the density difference was ignored following the basic assumption for the analytical solution 3 1 1 domain setup the domain for numerical simulations is a rectangle opqr as shown in fig 1 its horizontal length is 420 m and vertical height is 2 75 m representative value in table 1 the origin of the coordinates 0 0 was located at the top left corner of the model domain point o the domain was discretized into a mesh of 211 41 8651 nodes and 16 800 triangular elements with equal mesh spacing of 2 m in the horizontal direction and 0 07 m in the vertical direction 3 1 2 boundary and initial conditions the finite domain opqr was used for numerical simulations see fig 1 no flow boundary conditions were assigned on both sides and the bottom op qr and pq on the seabed boundary or a dirichlet boundary condition was applied based on the eq 3 the initial pressure head was approximated by the analytical solution at t 0 the model was run for 1 h with a time step was 0 05 s to obtain a periodical numerical solution until the difference of the pressure head between two successive wave cycles became negligible the periodical results were then used to compare with the analytical solution the parameter values used for the aquifer and wave properties are shown in table 1 3 2 numerical results fig 2 compared the time series of numerical and analytical results at three points left middle and right on the bottom of the domain during two wave cycles we can define the relative error i e the ratio of the difference between the analytical and the numerical results to the wave amplitude to examine the validity of the analytical solutions the relative error at left and right boundaries and the middle of the model domain were 0 52 0 49 and 0 11 respectively these small relative errors justified the assumption for the analytical solution that the permeable and impermeable layers extend horizontally infinitely at the middle of the model domain the analytical solution matched very well with the numerical result which manifested that the analytical solutions have acceptable accuracy in predicting the wave pumping head fluctuation with loading effect 4 discussion and sensitivity analyses of the analytical solution three important model parameters are involved in eq 10a which are the dimensionless thickness ad the dimensionless wave sediment parameter σ and loading efficiency le respectively it is important to determine the value ranges of these three parameters in specific coastal seabed systems to this end the values of le ad and σ corresponding to some case studies are calculated and will be applied in the following discussion for those who are listed in table 1 4 1 amplitude ratio and phase shift based on eqs 5 and 6a the amplitude ratio of water head is calculated for different combinations of l e ad and σ fig 3 overall the amplitude ratio increases with l e the larger σ is the more rapidly the amplitude ratio increases with l e when le 0 the amplitude ratio decreased exponentially with increasing ad and finally close to zero this means that the wave energy is dissipated when the wave propagates downward when le 0 the amplitude ratio decreased relatively slow with ad and then stayed constant at a value larger than zero it shows that the loading effect can cause the head to fluctuate with the same amplitude in the areas where propagated wave energy is totally dissipated in these areas head fluctuates as the pore space contracts and expands with wave fluctuations the loading effect can also slightly slow down the dissipation of wave because the slope of the amplitude ratio decreasing with ad is reduced when le 0 and σ 0 1 the change of amplitude ratio with thickness ad has some slightly different features namely these curves first decrease then increase and ultimately remain stable this bending part in the exponentially decay curves is because the reduced wave amplitude during wave propagation is encountered and superposed with background head fluctuation based on the assumption of linear porosity elasticity mei and foda 1981 coupled a set of the linearized governing equations to wave induced responses in a fluid filled porosity elastic solid with a free surface which showed the pore pressure response of a porosity elastic layer of finite depth to sea waves it has been revealed that for fine sand the pore pressure amplitude ratio diminished rapidly with increasing depth to a constant value with a bending very similar to the graph of l e 1 and σ 1 in this study from this perspective the reasonability of the analytical solution for water head fluctuation was verified to some extent the phase shift ψ of water head fluctuation in the sediment is calculated based on eqs 6a and 6b and presented in fig 4 in our analytical equations we set the upper wave boundary to change with time and space groundwater under a wave crest flows toward adjacent seabed under two troughs the divergent line to separate the two flow cells may be not vertical when le 0 the water head fluctuation lags behind the wave and the phase shift increase with increasing thickness the hysteresis cycle grew with increasing thickness and then these negative phase shifts all can be transferred to positive values since it can be interpreted that the water head fluctuation lags a basic phase value and random numbers of wave cycles when le 0 the loading effect causes the head fluctuations ahead of the wave one fact is noteworthy that the value of le can change the increasing rate of phase shift with thickness but the stabilized phase shift with thickness is independent of le however when le 0 5 the phase shift ψ first increases towards the positive axis until reaching a maximum value and then it decreases to a negative value with the increase of thickness and finally remains constant there it shows that the presence of the loading effect can change the phase shift of head fluctuation in a more complicated way 4 2 exchange capacity across the interface fig 5 shows the changes of sgd q m d with sediment thickness d m for different loading efficiency le wave parameters and hydraulic conductivities values are based on the representative values in table 1 since specific storage s s depends on the same parameters as loading efficiency le we set five different values of loading efficiency to represent five types of the solid medium one can see that sgd increases rapidly with increasing d then to a constant value the thickness of a groundwater cross section increases with the increment of d which permits more water to flow through the pore space under a wave crest is compacted and pore water is squeezed out while under a wave trough the pore space is expanded and groundwater fills in sgd q decreases monotonously with increasing l e stresses applied to a saturated porous medium are partly distributed to the solid skeleton and partly to the pore fluid the former stresses are responsible for skeletal deformations which explains why it is called effective stress it should be clarified that the compressibility of sediments mainly stems from rearrangement of the particles instead of compressibility of soil grains in response to a change in pressure the rearrangement of the particles results in a significant enhancement in the pore water pressure and a reduction in pressure gradients that is the reason for pressure gradients to be attenuated in compressible porous medium the loading efficiency is positively correlated with the compressibility of the porous medium and however due to the reduction of pressure gradients the capacity of sediment to squeeze water is in negative correlation to l e fig 6 shows how dimensionless outflow rate q 0 changes with the dimensionless wave sediment parameter σ for different loading efficiency le when ad 0 4 1 5 244 1 the values of ad were selected according to quartiles based on its value range in table 1 the dimensionless outflow rate q 0 decreases with increasing l e when σ 5 the difference in q 0 for different le is diminished when σ 5 it shows that q 0 is almost constant when σ is small then increases dramatically with σ when σ gets large dimensionless parameter σ is influenced by the combined effect of wave climate and sediment properties 5 conclusions this paper revealed the influence of poro elastic property of sediment on the hydrodynamic process within the permeable seabed a typical flat seabed unit was selected to investigate the wave pumping seawater groundwater circulation process using analytical models on the one hand wave motions triggered a pressure difference between seawater and pore water and ultimately increased the advective seawater groundwater circulation on the other hand wave induced changing seawater depth and weight had a loading effect on compressible aquifer skeleton and pore water which conversely weakened the pressure difference when the wave climbed up increasing wave gravity pressed the skeleton and pore water pressure raised in fact it lowered the pressure gradients between the wave crest and pore water when wave dropped down elastic soil skeleton recovered from deformation due to a decrease of wave gravity contrary to the response to wave crest pore water pressure under a wave trough dropped down so that the pressure difference between pore water and seawater was lowered the loading effect on the hydrodynamic process mainly functioned on heightening the amplitude of water head variation and weakening efflux and influx rates by lowering the pressure gradients the analytical solution can be employed to estimate aquifer parameters such as specific storage and horizontal hydraulic conductivity the applicability of the solution was demonstrated by investigating the water head fluctuation the amplitude ratio of groundwater head fluctuation in marine sediment decreased exponentially with the aquifer thickness and then stayed constant at a value larger than zero when considering wave loading and the decay rate decreased with increasing loading efficiency the loading effect caused the head fluctuations ahead of the wave the value of loading efficiency can change the increasing rate of phase shift with thickness but the stabilized phase shift with thickness was independent of loading efficiency wave induced sgd generally increased with the aquifer s thickness permeability wavenumber wave period and decreased with the loading efficiency and specific storage of the aquifer wave induced sgd across permeable marine sediments is ubiquitous in the coastal environment its biogeochemistry is strongly coupled to the hydrodynamic process above and within the sediments solute transports into and out of the sediments are significantly impacted by advective pore water exchange between the sediment and water column credit authorship contribution statement shengchao yu conceptualization methodology software

3016,euphotic zone depth z eu is a key indicator of underwater light environment that regulates different biogeochemical and physical processes in aquatic ecosystem remote sensing approaches offer a unique opportunity to frequently monitor z eu although its estimation from diffuse attenuation coefficient k d requires depth profiles of the down welling irradiance e d measuring e d values at

growth and distribution of aquatic plants sánchez et al 2015 the depth of light penetration in a water column euphotic zone depth z eu and the rate at which light availability diminishes with water depth diffuse attenuation coefficient k d are two critical parameters used for quantitatively describing underwater light environment kirk 1991 optically active constituents oacs in water column control these parameters through absorption and scattering processes scheffer 2004 kirk 1991 preisendorfer 1986 because both spatial and temporal distribution of oacs significantly influence underwater light environment gomes et al 2020 brewin et al 2014 zheng et al 2016 frequent mapping of z eu and k d are needed for managing aquatic ecosystems in oceanic waters light attenuation is mainly dominated by seawater and chlorophyll contents along with other photosynthetic pigments of living phytoplankton lee et al 2020 shang et al 2011 however light attenuation in coastal and complex inland waterbodies is largely influenced by suspended particulate matter spm and colored dissolved organic material cdom simon and shanmugam 2016 matsushita et al 2015 shi et al 2014 although secchi disc depth z sd is commonly used as an approximate measure of light attenuation jiang et al 2019 alikas and kratzer 2017 lee et al 2015 k d and z eu are more quantitative measures of water clarity and light availability gomes et al 2020 majozi et al 2014 with the availability of different satellite data such as modis meris spot and landsat remote sensing approaches have been developed over the last decade to estimate z eu and k d values over photosynthetically active radiation par for oceans wang et al 2021 mitchell and cunningham 2015 son and wang 2015 chen et al 2014 saulquin et al 2013 shang et al 2011 and several inland waterbodies yang et al 2020 huang and yao 2017 shen et al 2017 song et al 2017 liu et al 2016 majozi et al 2014 zhang et al 2012 the copernicus sentinel 2 from the european space agency esa is a relatively new remote sensing mission providing multispectral instrument msi image data from its two platforms s2a and s2b with the goal to maintain continuity of spot and landsat type image data the s2a s2b msi data have not been used for estimating z eu although higher spatial 10 to 60 m and temporal 5 day coverage with high signal to noise ratio make sentinel s2a s2b msi data an attractive choice for evaluating inland waterbodies pahlevan et al 2017 in remote sensing approaches z eu values are typically estimated from k d par 1 z e u 4 605 k d p a r kirk 1991 estimation of k d par requires that the downwelling irradiance e d is measured at multiple water depths most sensor assemblies required for measuring e d are designed primarily for ocean water monitoring it becomes a challenging task to deploy such assemblies in inland waterbodies many of which are quite shallow therefore k d par is often estimated using a empirical relationship between k d par and oacs doron et al 2011 morel et al 2007 b semi quasi analytical inversion models based on radiative transfer modeling that relates k d par with remote sensing derived a λ and backscattering coefficient b b saulquin et al 2013 lee et al 2005 and c empirical relationship between k d par and r rs majozi et al 2014 zhang et al 2012 the oac based algorithms are generally unsuitable for estimating k d par in optically complex inland waters shi et al 2014 the quasi analytical algorithm qaa and its updated versions lee et al 2002 lee et al 2009 lee 2014 are often less accurate in highly turbid eutrophic waters vandermeulen et al 2015 shanmugam et al 2010 moreover a fundamental assumption considered in developing qaa for inland water is that the absorption coefficient of water constituents a t w value is negligible over the near infrared nir region although the reference wavelength λ0 selected from the nir region differs from model to model e g λ 753 nm in yang et al 2013 λ 709 nm in li et al 2013 and λ 750 nm in xue et al 2019 such an assumption often leads to the underestimation of a t w over 400 to 550 nm wavelength region röttgers et al 2013 de carvalho et al 2015 moreover with the inherent complexity of light propagation in turbid water many ocean color algorithms based on inherent optical property iop a and bb gordon et al 1988 kirk 1991 lee et al 2005 lee et al 2013 often fail to accurately estimate k d values in turbid and eutrophic waters chen et al 2014 simon and shanmugam 2016 therefore many studies adopted empirical models to estimate k d par and z eu directly from in situ measured or satellite sensor acquired r rs products for different inland waters song et al 2017 liu et al 2016 for oceans and coastal turbid waters k d data are routinely provided by ocean color satellite sensors however in case of inland water r rs based algorithms must be re evaluated for their applicability to estimate k d in this study we revisited r rs based empirical algorithms method 3 to estimate k d par following zeu using s2a s2b msi r rs data in chilika lagoon being asia s largest brackish water lagoon and home to over 800 species of fauna and

available s2a s2b msi data at high spatial and temporal resolutions specific objectives of this study are to 1 evaluate the performance of existing r rs based empirical models to estimate k d par

each day during this period typically clear sky conditions prevailed during the field measurements and we avoided making measurements if we noticed any floating cloud in the sky water samples and optical data both photometric and radiometric were collected across the northern and central part of the chilika lagoon the timeframes of the field campaigns were selected to avoid high wind speed and

sorting approach viscarra rossel et al 2006 to divide the entire dataset n 61 into 41 calibration and 20 validation subsets by first arranging k d par values in ascending order and then selecting every 3rd sample as the validation samples n 20 and remaining as calibration samples n 41 therefore 20 fold cross validation method was adopted to evaluate model performance using rmse and mapd as the accuracy measures linear logarithmic power and exponential relationships were calibrated and corresponding r2 rmse and mapd values in the validation datasets were estimated fig 2 shows the overall framework of the study to estimate zeu from s2a s2b r rs data capability to estimate k d par from s2a s2b msi data offers an opportunity to estimate spatio temporal variability of z eu of the chilika lagoon for temporal assessment the seasons were classified into pre monsoon march june monsoon july october and post monsoon november february seasons with the availability of frequent cloud free s2a s2b data we estimated z eu values across the lagoon for all the 85 msi acquisition dates however the number of cloud free days during the monsoon period was generally less seasonal variation of z eu values was assessed by averaging z eu values for each water pixels of the chilika lagoon we selected images with 10 cloud cover in the s2a s2b msi scene with no cloud cover over the chilika lagoon for pre monsoon and post monsoon in case of monsoon season cloud cover over the selected s2a s2b msi scene was not more than 30 with negligible cloud cover over the chilika lagoon high resolution maps of z eu were generated for these three major seasons temporal mean in spatial scale mean z eu of all the pixels in each image s2a s2b msi acquisition date was also calculated to get the temporal dynamics of z eu spatial mean in temporal scale to analyze the spatial variability of z eu values the lagoon was divided into four different sectors the northern sector freshwater zone southern sector saline zone central sector brackish zone and the outer channel sector saline zone pal and mohanty 2002 ghosh and pattnaik 2005 seasonal pattern of z eu in each sector were estimated also the areal coverage of each sector was classified into two classes based on the z eu z ratio when the estimated ratio exceeds 1 0 it suggests that light can reach to the sediment bed or bottom depth of the water column which is suitable for aquatic plant growth 3 results 3 1 in situ data table 2 lists the descriptive statistics for spm chl a zsd and water depth values measured at different sampling locations in the chilika lagoon sampling locations were distributed over about 60 of the total area covering the central and northern part of the lagoon fig 1 salinity values measured with the wetlab s sbe37 sensor ranged 0 20 to 1 91 psu in the northern sector and 0 14 to 7 95 psu in the central sector during our field campaigns sea water entry through the mouth fig 1 along the outer channel increases salinity in the central sector and the freshwater from the tributaries along the northern and western catchments contribute to low salinity in the northern sector measured water depth values ranged from 0 80 m to 2 50 m which suggested that the sampled areas of the lagoon are shallow rampant fishing activities in such shallow areas are expected to create high turbidity as is evident from the observed spm values range 12 2 to 99 0 mg l 1 measured z sd values ranged from 0 15 to 1 25 m with an exponential relationship with the corresponding spm contents r2 0 60 n 61 based on pre and post monsoon measurements jally et al 2020 reported spm concentrations to range from 5 3 to 289 1 mg l 1 with z sd in the range of 0 10 to 1 81 m in the chilika lagoon because our sampling was done during the post monsoon periods the observed ranges could be less compared to those reported by jally et al 2020 table 2 also shows that chl a values ranged from 0 003 to 72 8 mg m 3 mean value 7 1 mg m 3 only four sampling locations had chl a concentrations above 20 mg m 3 variations in chl a contents in the range of 3 4 to 17 7 mg m 3 during 2011 ganguly et al 2015 and 3 4 to 39 6 mg m 3 during 2013 to 2014 sahoo et al 2017 have been reported for the lagoon measured a λ values at 25 out of 61 sampling locations in the chilika lagoon showed an exponentially decreasing trend with the increase in wavelength values fig 3 a typically seen with the turbid water dominated by cdom or non algal matter röttgers et al 2013 the a spectra measured in situ varied with spm contents for instance a values at 490 nm ranged from 0 42 m 1 to 9 10 m 1 with corresponding spm values in the range of 18 3 mg l 1 to 99 0 mg l 1 estimated k d 490 and k d par values showed large variations with the coefficient of variation cv of 84 and 64 respectively values of k d 490 ranged from 1 7 m 1 to 17 7 m 1 with a mean value of 5 4 m 1 estimated k d par values ranged from 1 8 m 1 to 10 74 m 1 with the mean value of 3 9 m 1 corresponding z eu values varied from 0 43 m to 2 56 m which shows the characteristics of typical shallow and turbid water in the chilika lagoon the r rs spectra fig 3b showed typical features observed in turbid water condition where the peak reflectance values varied from 0 008 to 0 065 sr 1 with near 10 fold change in corresponding spm concentrations 12 2 to 99 0 mg l 1 similarly the peak reflectance values were seen over the green to red regions 557 to 583 nm instead of blue region typically observed with the ocean water fig 4 a shows the relationship between k d 490 and k d par in the chilika lagoon which is similar to those observed for the taihu lake in china zhang et al 2012 and naivasha lake in kenya majozi et al 2014 estimated k d par and z sd values also closely match those from the irish sea york river and bons sinai fig 4b obtained from the archives of william mary s scholarworks bowers et al 2020 the dataset of bowers et al 2020 follows a power relationship k d par 1 54 zsd 0 98 similar relationship was also observed by lee et al 2018 with a global dataset where k d par 1 48 zsd 1 when validated with the chilika lagoon dataset n 25 the relationship yielded a rmse value of 1 3 m 1 and mapd of 23 for k d par because of such close match with several published datasets we used our developed model to estimate k d par values using the measured z sd at the remaining 36 sampling locations where optical data could not be recorded resulting k d par estimates for these 36 locations ranged from 1 3 m 1 to 6 2 m 1 with the mean value of 2 4 m 1 corresponding zeu values ranged from 0 7 m to 3 6 m with the mean value of 2 3 m for these 36 sampling locations overall for 61 sampling locations zeu showed power function relationship with spm r2 0 54 although no strong correlation was observed between z eu and chl a an exponential relationship between z eu and chl a r2 0 53 was observed when locations with chl a values exceeding 20 mg m 3 were excluded from the dataset 3 2 development of empirical models for zeu based on rrs 3 2 1 selection of band variables from rrs data for estimating zeu with no global retrieval model available for k d par and z eu for shallow and turbid inland waters we used multiple models table 1 to estimate k d par and z eu values using r rs values of s2a s2b msi equivalent bands out of six different models m2 showed best performance with the lowest rmse 1 81 m 1 and mapd 48 followed by m3 rmse 2 15 m 1 model performance also varies with the atmospheric correction algorithms used and the type of satellite sensors therefore we examined k d par and z eu relationships table 1 with different r rs band variables single band band ratios and band difference derived from s2a s2b msi fig 4a shows that k d par may be estimated from the band ratio of b4 to b2 with the highest r2 value 0 78 the band ratio of b1 to b4 yielded r2 value of 0 67 fig 5 e and the least r2 value of 0 30 was observed for the ratio of b3 to b2 fig 5b similar r2 values 0 74 and 0 75 were observed for b4 fig 4c and for band difference of b2 and b4 fig 4d while estimating k d par in general these best performing band variables in m1 to m6 for the chilika lagoon with s2a s2b msi r rs data are different from those originally used while developing these models the time difference between s2a s2b msi and in situ measurements 2 days may have added some uncertainty secondly the chl a concentration is lower in the chilika lagoon compared to the specific waterbodies for which models m1 and m6 were proposed also more in situ data should be collected in various seasons because of the difference in seasonal bio optical properties based on the oacs concentrations reported by previous studies and in situ measurement conducted in this study it is evident that spm is the dominant oac in the chilika lagoon therefore optical properties may be governed by the spm for entire year and uncertainty produced by limited seasonal in situ measurements may be neglected nevertheless it is necessary to evaluate different combination of s2a s2b msi r rs band variables for more accurate estimation of k d par because of the optically complex nature of the chilika lagoon 3 2 2 estimation of zeu using selected band variables table 3 shows different r rs bands band ratios and band differences calibrated and validated with s2a s2b msi data for predicting k d par in the chilika lagoon modeling analysis showed that b4 b5 and band difference between b2 and b4 performed better than other band variables the r rs bands b4 and b5 showed r2 values of 0 77 and 0 78 respectively for the calibration dataset the r rs band b4 showed rmse of 1 25 m 1 and mapd of 25 for the validation dataset band difference of b2 and b4 showed similar r2 value of 0 78 with the calibration dataset however higher rmse 1 34 m 1 and mapd 25 values were observed with band difference of b2 and b4 variable with the validation dataset these results indicate that the simple single variable model from s2a s2b msi data can be used to estimate k d par in the chilika lagoon however uncertainties associated with atmospheric correction needed to be assessed as single band values exhibit higher uncertainty compared to band ratio and band difference parameters fig 6 shows the overall comparison between in situ r rs at 443 492 560 665 and 704 nm with s2a s2b msi derived r rs for a single bands b band ratios and c band differences shown in table 3 in general models developed with band differences exhibited the lowest uncertainty high r2 and large slope value for s2a s2b msi b4 r rs vs in situ r rs associated with atmospheric correction with overall slope value of 0 68 and r2 of 0 82 fig 6c single bands showed the highest uncertainty slope 0 56 r2 0 67 uncertainty associated with band ratios are higher than those for band differences although single band model based on b5 table 3 showed the lowest rmse and mapd s2a s2b msi b5 showed slope of 0 51 when compared with in situ r rs at 704 nm slope value of 0 61 was observed between s2a s2b msi b4 and in situ r rs at 665 nm on the other hand band difference of b2 and b4 showed slope of 0 70 when compared with the in situ r rs difference at 492 and 665 nm therefore single band models may produce higher uncertainties than band ratio or band difference based models under different atmospheric conditions we selected all the s2a s2b msi r rs band ratios and band differences table 1 as variables in the mlr for predicting k d par single r rs bands were not included to avoid uncertainties associated with atmospheric correction stepwise forward and backward variable selection were carried out based on p value 0 05 in the mlr analysis variables b2 b4 and b3 b5 were selected for both stepwise and forward selection in case of backward selection 3 band difference variables were selected modeling results showed similar performance for both the set of variables with r2 value 0 89 and standard error of 0 93 both the models also showed similar validation performance therefore we selected the following mlr model with two variables b2 b4 and b3 b5 for estimating k d par 8 k d p a r 2 57 422 03 b 2 b 4 128 55 b 3 b 5 fig 7 a shows the calibration and validation performance of eq 8 with residual errors shown in fig 7b the new mlr model showed improved rmse of 1 09 m 1 with the validation dataset when compared with single variable band ratio or band difference models to predict k d par improved mapd value of 22 was observed with the mlr model for validation dataset with lower uncertainty associated with atmospheric correction eq 8 was finally selected to estimate k d par to map z eu based on eq 1 3 3 spatio temporal dynamics of zeu in the chilika lagoon fig 8 a shows the spatial maps of mean seasonal zeu values in the chilika lagoon generated from s2a s2b msi data lowest zeu values in the northern sector of the lagoon are expected because of incoming sediment fluxes from five different rivulets of mahanadi system and several streams from the western catchment of the lagoon low z eu values in the eastern part and the outer channel near the sea mouth region of the lagoon also explain water mixing due to the tidal current from the bay of bengal boating activity along the managed route of regular ferry and regular dredging activities performed for maintaining the ferry route however low cv values can be observed in the outer channel throughout the year fig 8b fishing activities and wind driven sediment resuspension in shallow areas may be the reason behind low z eu values and high cvs fig 8b in the lagoon during pre monsoon period mukherjee et al 2018 and sahoo et al 2017 reported higher chlorophyll concentration and lower water depth during pre monsoon season in the central and southern sector of the lagoon compared to other seasons also s2a s2b msi derived mean z eu values for all the water pixels in each image acquisition date over the chilika lagoon were calculated fig 9 shows the temporal variation of z eu across the lagoon with maximum wind speed and daily rainfall downloaded from nasa data access viewer website and odisha rainfall monitoring system website https rainfall nic in pubrainchart asp respectively a decreasing trend from march april to may june and increasing trend from may june to october in z eu values during the occurrence of high wind speed and rainfall can be observed in fig 9 it can be observed that z eu is more strongly influenced by wind speed than rainfall because of shallow depth causing wind driven resuspension of sediment in the chilika lagoon analysis of sector wise z eu data showed a mean z eu value of 0 97 m during the monsoon season in the northern sector compared to mean z eu value of 1 02 m and 1 14 m in pre and post monsoon seasons respectively mean z eu value of 0 93 m 1 m and 1 31 m were observed in the outer channel during pre monsoon monsoon and post monsoon seasons respectively however mean z eu value in the central sector reduces to 1 42 m in the pre monsoon season from 1 98 m in post monsoon season mean z eu value of 1 68 m was observed in the central sector during monsoon season higher z eu values were observed in the southern sector of the lagoon compared to other sectors with mean values of 1 51 m 2 25 m and 2 18 m during pre monsoon monsoon and post monsoon seasons respectively overall similar trend can be observed in the central sector and outer channel of the lagoon where z eu gradually increases from pre to post monsoon seasons fig 10 a however northern and southern sectors of the lagoon showed a complete opposite trend where zeu is the lowest in northern sector and highest in southern sector during monsoon season increase in water depth but no sediment transport from northern sector to southern sector may be the reason behind such an opposite trend as the mean seasonal z in all the four sectors of chilika lagoon was reported by mukherjee et al 2018 we estimated zeu z ratio for the chilika lagoon we also estimated ratio of area where zeu z 1 a1 and zeu z 1 a0 for each sector fig 10b liu et al 2016 earlier showed that the proportion of macrophyte coverage increases with the increase in zeu z ratio the ratio of zeu z 1 indicates light reaching to the bottom which is ideal for the growth of submerged macrophytes therefore the ratio a1 a0 in each sector of the lagoon may give critical information of the macrophyte presence higher the ratio a1 a0 higher is the suitability of sub merged macrophyte growth fig 9c shows pictures of aquatic macrophytes captured during sampling campaigns in the chilika lagoon the lowest value of a1 a0 was observed in the outer channel of the chilika lagoon after outer channel northern sector showed low value of a1 a0 0 15 during pre monsoon 0 09 during monsoon and 0 06 during post monsoon 4 discussion euphotic depth is a key parameter used in characterizing underwater light environment in general light attenuation measurements may be used to estimate z eu specifically z eu may be readily estimated from k d par values which requires the downwelling irradiance e d be measured at multiple water depths most sensor assemblies required for measuring photometric and radiometric quantities are designed primarily for ocean water monitoring it becomes a challenging task to deploy such assemblies in inland waterbodies many of which are quite shallow the lack of modern boating facilities to carry heavy sensor assemblies such as iop and aop profilers adds to the challenge of obtaining e d depth profiles in the chilika lagoon nevertheless constantly improving spectral spatial and temporal resolutions of available remote sensing data provide opportunity to characterize water quality in eutrophic and inland waterbodies such as chilika lagoon with limited studies on underwater light interactions in turbid waterbodies involving s2a s2b msi we examined the capability of combining limited iop and aop measurements with s2a s2b data for estimating z eu values for the entire chilika lagoon much of the chilika lagoon is shallow its water is turbid with a salinity gradient extending from the bay of bengal through its mouth in the east to the fresh water in the west fed by several distributaries of the mahanadi river and small rivers from the western catchment interestingly shallow waterbodies from other parts of world show similar spm but higher chl a contents as compared to the chilika lagoon for instance about 10 70 mg l 1 spm and 12 9 128 63 mg m 3 chl a contents in taihu lake in china le et al 2009 4 81 61 0 mg l 1 spm and 9 8 153 9 mg m 3 chl a contents in suwa and kasumigaura lakes in japan yang et al 2013 and similar ranges in other shallow waterbodies pan et al 2015 xue et al 2019 have been reported low chl a values in the chilika lagoon may be because of constant river water influx from several streams from the western and northern side of the lagoon influx of river water maintains low salinity in the northern and western part of the lagoon while eastern part remains saline because of intrusion of sea water through the presence of a mouth along the bay of bengal as in the case of chilika lagoon high sediment concentration is reported to result in large reflectance values and shifting of r rs peak to the red and nir regions qiu 2013 li et al 2013 also have reported similar features for r rs spectra collected from the shitoukoumen reservoir in china that had spm and chl a concentrations in the range of 3 7 211 9 mg l 1 and 1 9 47 5 mg m 3 respectively measured absorption spectra and estimated k d values in the chilika lagoon were similar in magnitude to those reported from other inland waterbodies of the world for example ficek et al 2012 have reported similar a spectra for eutrophic water of pomeranian lakes poland majozi et al 2014 reported similar ranges of z eu 0 7 m to 2 7 m for the lake naivasha kenya and shi et al 2014 have reported similar k d par range 0 7 m 1 to 15 4 m 1 for the lake taihu china we estimated k d par values from a values measured at 400 to 700 nm at 25 different locations in the chilika lagoon we augmented small size of our datasets using the k d par and zsd values publicly available for the irish sea york river and bons sinai archived at the william mary s scholarworks with the developed relationship validated with k d par and z sd measurements k d par values were estimated for additional 36 locations the similarity observed between the k d par vs z sd in the chilika lagoon and those from other sediment dominated turbid inland waterbodies provided a reliable basis for developing s2a s2b msi based retrieval model for z eu next we examined and reparametrized the existing empirical models to estimate z eu values using different band variables constructed with the s2a s2b extracted r rs values resulting model performance in fig 5 clearly showed that models based only on a single band involve large uncertainties because of inaccuracies associated with atmospheric correction favoring the use of multivariate model developed using b2 b4 and b3 b5 as predictors for z eu with the capability to estimate k d par from s2a s2b msi data we further evaluated spatio temporal variability of z eu in the chilika lagoon we estimated z eu across the lagoon for 85 different acquisition dates between jan 2017 and jun 2021 seasonal variability of z eu in all the major sectors of chilika lagoon were assessed a decreasing trend in z eu value from march april to may june and increasing trend from may june to october coinciding high wind speed and rainfall events were observed from spatial mean of z eu for each s2a s2b msi image acquisition dates from the estimated temporal mean of zeu similar trends were observed in central sector and outer channel of the lagoon where z eu gradually increased from pre to post monsoon however northern and southern sectors of the lagoon showed a complete opposite trend where z eu was the lowest in the northern sector and highest in the southern sector during monsoon season increase in water depth but no sediment transport from the northern sector to southern sector because of the presence of submerged macrophyte in central and southern sectors may be the reason of such opposite trend interestingly the macrophyte presence closely followed the spatial trends in z eu in the chilika lagoon pattnaik et al 2020 reported that the outer channel remains mostly weed free whereas floating macrophytes are frequently present in the northern sector low value of a1 a0 in the northern sector may be driven by the nutrient rich sediment entering the lagoon explaining the presence of floating macrophytes higher value of a1 a0 in the central and southern sectors may be conducive to submerged macrophyte growth as also is reported by pattnaik et al 2020 the highest a1 a0 value of 4 5 was observed during the post monsoon season in the central sector whereas a1 a0 value of 1 47 was observed during the pre monsoon season in monsoon season a1 a0 value remained below 0 5 in all the sectors low a1 a0 value of 0 13 is observed in the southern sector during the pre monsoon season the linkage between the macrophyte presence with z eu merits a detailed and more extensive investigation specifically the possibility observed with the remote sensing data for macrophyte management may further be explored 5 conclusion knowledge of zeu plays a crucial role in studying biogeochemical cycles and ecosystem of our ecologically fragile inland water bodies such as the chilika lagoon capability to estimate k d par from s2a s2b msi data with efficient models offer an opportunity to monitor such fragile ecosystems in an efficient manner in this study we collected water quality parameters covering about 60 of the total area of the chilika lagoon coinciding the s2a s2b msi data acquisition schedule standard k d par and z eu models designed for turbid water were examined however such models failed to capture the observed trends primarily because of the difference in satellite sensor and bio optical complexity of chilika lagoon therefore we calibrated and validated different r rs band variables single bands band ratios and band differences of s2a s2b msi with k d par estimated in the chilika lagoon modeling results showed that r rs band variables involving b4 b5 and band difference between b2 and b4 performed better compared to other band variables in estimating k d par among single r rs bands b5 showed the least rmse 0 81 m 1 and mapd 24 when k d par was estimated in the validation dataset similarly b4 showed the rmse value of 1 25 m 1 and mapd of 25 similar rmse 1 34 m 1 and mapd 25 values were observed for band difference between b2 and b4 with the test dataset to predict k d par in general single r rs bands showed higher uncertainties associated with atmospheric correction compared to r rs band ratios and band differences stepwise forward and backward variable selection was also carried out to improve model performance using the mlr approach which resulted in r2 value of 0 80 and standard error of 0 93 the new mlr model showed rmse of 1 09 m 1 and improved mapd 22 to predict k d par with low uncertainty associated with atmospheric correction once the model was calibrated and validated s2a s2b msi data for the entire chilika lagoon for 85 different acquisition dates between jan 2017 and jun 2021 were processed to understand seasonal variability of z eu in all the major sectors of chilika lagoon a decreasing trend in z eu value from march april to may june and increasing trend from may june to october coinciding high wind speed and rainfall events were observed similar trends were observed in the central sector and the outer channel of the lagoon where z eu gradually increased from pre to post monsoon however northern and southern sectors of the lagoon showed a completely opposite trend possibly because of the extent of submerged macrophytes the macrophyte presence closely followed the spatial trends in z eu in the chilika lagoon these results present new opportunities for managing macrophytes using high spectral resolution remote sensing data in the chilika lagoon specifically high spatial and temporal

3016,euphotic zone depth z eu is a key indicator of underwater light environment that regulates different biogeochemical and physical processes in aquatic ecosystem remote sensing approaches offer a unique opportunity to frequently monitor z eu although its estimation from diffuse attenuation coefficient k d requires depth profiles of the down welling irradiance e d measuring e d values at different water depths i e e d profiling in shallow waterbodies is a challenging task with the available profiling equipment in this study k d values were estimated from measured absorption

reflectance r rs a values wavelength 400 715 nm at 4 nm interval secchi disc depth zsd suspended particulate matter spm and chlorophyll a chl a contents were measured during oct 07 08 2018 and feb 02 08 2019 in the chilika lagoon atmospherically corrected sentinel 2a 2b s2a s2b msi r rs data level 2a were then used to develop algorithms for mapping z eu for the entire lagoon modeling results showed that r rs values at band 4 665 nm or band 5 704 nm extracted from the s2a s2b msi data may be used to estimate k d of photosynthetically active radiation par observed range 1 29 m 1 to 10 74 m 1 with the root mean squared error rmse as low as 0 81 m 1 however uncertainties associated with atmospheric correction of s2a s2b msi single band r rs values are high when compared with in situ r rs thus a multivariate modeling approach was adopted with r rs band ratio and band difference variables selected by stepwise forward and backward variable selection method with p 0 05 modeling results showed that the band differences between band 2 and band 4 and band 3 and band 5 may be used to estimate k d par with improved mean absolute percentage difference mapd while ensuring low uncertainty

underwater light environment gomes et al 2020 brewin et al 2014 zheng et al 2016 frequent mapping of z eu and k d are needed for managing aquatic ecosystems in oceanic waters light attenuation is mainly dominated by seawater and chlorophyll contents along with other photosynthetic pigments of living phytoplankton lee et al 2020 shang et al 2011 however light attenuation in coastal and complex inland waterbodies is largely influenced by suspended particulate matter spm and colored dissolved organic material cdom simon and shanmugam 2016 matsushita et al 2015 shi et al 2014 although secchi

light availability gomes et al 2020 majozi et al 2014 with the availability of different satellite data such as modis meris spot and landsat remote sensing approaches have been developed over the last decade to estimate z eu and k d values over photosynthetically active radiation par for oceans wang et al 2021 mitchell and cunningham 2015 son and wang 2015 chen et al 2014 saulquin et al 2013 shang

european space agency esa is a relatively new remote sensing mission providing multispectral instrument msi image data from its two platforms s2a and s2b with the goal to maintain continuity of spot and landsat type image data the s2a s2b msi data have not been used for estimating z eu although higher spatial 10 to 60 m and temporal 5 day coverage with high signal to noise ratio make sentinel s2a s2b msi data an attractive choice for evaluating inland waterbodies pahlevan et al 2017 in remote sensing approaches z eu values are typically estimated from k d par 1 z e u 4 605 k d p a r kirk 1991 estimation of k d par requires that the downwelling irradiance e d is measured at multiple water depths most sensor assemblies required for measuring e d are designed primarily for ocean water

coefficient b b saulquin et al 2013 lee et al 2005 and c empirical relationship between k d par and r rs majozi et al 2014 zhang et al 2012 the oac based algorithms are generally unsuitable for estimating k d par in optically complex inland waters shi et al 2014 the quasi analytical algorithm qaa and its updated versions lee et al 2002 lee et al 2009 lee 2014 are often less accurate in highly turbid eutrophic waters vandermeulen et al 2015 shanmugam et al 2010 moreover a fundamental assumption considered in developing qaa for inland water is that the absorption coefficient of water constituents a t w value is negligible over the near infrared nir region although the reference wavelength λ0 selected from the nir region differs from model to model e g λ 753 nm in yang et al 2013 λ 709 nm in li et al 2013 and λ 750 nm in xue et al 2019 such an assumption often leads to the underestimation of a t w over 400 to 550 nm wavelength region röttgers et al 2013 de carvalho et al 2015 moreover with the inherent complexity of light propagation in turbid water many ocean color algorithms based on inherent optical property iop a and bb gordon et al 1988 kirk 1991 lee et al 2005 lee et al 2013 often fail to accurately estimate k d values in turbid and eutrophic waters chen et al 2014 simon and shanmugam 2016 therefore many studies adopted empirical models to estimate k d par and z eu directly from in situ measured or satellite sensor acquired r rs products for different inland waters song et al 2017 liu et al 2016 for oceans and coastal turbid waters k d data are routinely provided by ocean color satellite sensors however in case of inland water r rs based algorithms must be re evaluated for their applicability to estimate k d in this study we revisited r rs based empirical algorithms method 3 to estimate k d par following zeu using s2a s2b msi r rs data in chilika lagoon being asia s largest brackish water lagoon and home to over 800 species of fauna and several aquatic weeds rath and adhikary 2008 this productive ecosystem provides livelihood to more than 200 000 fishermen in the surrounding area mohapatra et al 2007 with the opportunity of freely available s2a s2b msi data at high spatial and temporal resolutions specific objectives of this study are to 1 evaluate the performance of existing r rs based empirical models to estimate k d par using s2a s2b msi r rs data 2 develop a robust empirical algorithm to estimate k d par directly from s2a s2b msi r rs product to map z eu over chilika lagoon and 3 estimate spatial and temporal dynamics of z eu in chilika lagoon 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and in situ data collection chilika lagoon is located on the eastern coast of odisha along the bay of bengal 19 28 19 54 n and 85 06 85 35 e spreading north south over a stretch of about 65 km it has an average water depth of 1 8 m pradhan et al 2017 and water spread area of about 906 km2 to 1165 km2 pal and mohanty 2002 daya bhargavi luna and makara rivers from the mahanadi basin and 47 streams from the western catchment feed freshwater to the lagoon seawater enters through narrow mouth along the bay of bengal outer channel and palur canal creating a gradient of salinity across the lagoon mean salinity values range from about 35 psu in the outer channel to 10 psu in the northern sector and main body of the lagoon mohanty and panda 2009 water residence time in the lagoon varies from 5 days in the outer channel to about 132 days in the northern sector mahanty et al 2016 total sediment load from the mahanadi system during the year 2010 was estimated about 1 9 105 metric tons cda 2013 santra and das 2013 reported sediment load of about 1 5 105 metric tons from western catchment to the lagoon for the year 2002 air temperature ranges from 10 c in december to 40 c in june with an average value of about 27 c similarly the wind speed of the region ranges from 5 to 65 km h 1 cda 2013 with an annual rainfall of about 1130 mm santra and das 2013 two field campaigns were conducted in oct 07 08 2018 and feb 02 08 2019 coinciding with the s2a s2b schedule all measurements were made between 10 am to 2 pm in each day during this period typically clear sky conditions prevailed during the field measurements and we avoided making measurements if we noticed any floating cloud in the sky water samples and optical data both photometric and radiometric were collected across the northern and central part of the chilika lagoon the timeframes of the field campaigns were selected to avoid high wind speed and water current for maintaining consistency between water condition and optical measurements the wind speed data downloaded from nasa data access viewer website https power larc nasa gov data access viewer ranges from 0 58 to 23 72 km h 1 and 1 12 to 16 27 km h 1 in our field campaign 1 and 2 respectively fig 1 shows 61 different sampling locations in the lagoon considered for this study water samples were collected from top 20 cm water depth along with the total water depth z and z sd optical measurements were carried out in 25 out of 61 locations for the remaining 36 locations k d par values were estimated from measured z sd values image acquisition dates of oct 5 2018 feb 2 2019 and feb 7 2019 coincided with in situ data collection and five r rs band b1 to b5 values from s2a s2b msi for each sampling location were used for statistical analysis suspended particulate matter concentrations in the collected water samples were measured using the gravimetric method van der linde 1998 acetone extraction method jeffrey and humphrey 1975 using a uv vis spectrometer uv 1700 pharmaspec shimadzu corp usa was used to estimate chl a concentration the k d par values at a specific depth z 1 m for all the 25 out of 61 water sampling locations were estimated by integrating e d values over 400 to 700 nm mobley 1994 2 k d p a r z 1 z l n e d p a r z e d p a r 0 where e d z values of 400 to 700 nm wavelength were calculated from the spectral k d values based on austin and petzold 1981 3 e d λ z e d λ 0 e x p k d λ z z we assumed e d 0 values to be 100 over 400 to 700 nm which is appropriate for white light the k d λ values were estimated using the predictive equation for productive inland water proposed by simon and shanmugam 2016 4 k d λ 1 c o s θ a λ a λ 3 1 a λ 0 01 the wetlabs ac s sensor sea bird inc oregon usa was used to measure a and beam attenuation coefficient c with 4 nm spectral resolution from 400 to 737 nm sensor accuracy 0 01 m 1 over 0 30 0c of water temperature the scattering effect on a measurement was corrected using the algorithm proposed by röttgers et al 2013 for the remaining 36 locations k d par values were estimated from measured z sd values the relationship between k d par and z sd were established using the dataset n 246 of irish sea york river bons sinais archived at the william mary s scholarworks bowers et al 2020 and validated with chilika lagoon dataset n 25 the developed relationship was found close to the one proposed by lee et al 2018 to collect radiometric data hyperocr radiance and irradiance sensors satlantic halifax nova scotia cosine response within 3 in 0 60 within 10 in 60 85 were used where e d just above water surface along with the total radiance from water l t and sky radiance l sky were measured 350 nm to 800 nm 4 nm interval measured radiometric quantities were used to calculate r rs λ values mobley 1994 5 r r s l w e d 0 l t ρ l s k y e d 0 where l w is the water leaving radiance ρ

resolution the s2a s2b msi is useful for estimating water reflectance and mapping of water quality parameters pahlevan et al 2017 vanhellemont and ruddick 2016 therefore we downloaded s2a s2b msi l1c data over the chilika lagoon for 85 acquisition dates jan 2017 to jun 2021 from the european space agency esa hub all the downloaded s2a s2b msi top of the atmosphere radiance ltoa products were atmospherically corrected using acolite software available on the royal belgian institute of natural sciences website wang et al 2021 pahlevan et al 2020 hafeez and wong 2019 dark spectrum fitting dsf atmospheric correction for aquatic applications vanhellemont 2019 was used to generate s2a s2b msi r rs bands sun glints were corrected using the short wave infrared swir bands harmel et al 2018 included as default in the acolite software default 10 m resolution was used in this study for acolite processing of 20 m and 60 m bands where values are replicated by the nearest neighbor resampling approach thus values from the 20 m and 60 m bands were replicated 4 and 36 times to form a 10 m grid 2 3 estimation of zeu we examined six different empirical models table 1 for estimating z eu with equivalent s2a s2b msi r rs bands with matching in situ k d par data collected from ground truth locations of the chilika lagoon the criterion for matching s2a s2b msi and in situ observations was set to 2 days to maximize the number of possible matching pairs between satellite and in situ observations shi et al 2014 both linear and nonlinear relationships between k d par and s2a s2b msi r rs band variables single band band ratios and band differences were examined for estimating k d par in chilika lagoon stepwise forward and backward variable selection based on p values p 0 05 and a multiple linear regression approach mlr were followed to estimate k d par from s2a s2b msi r rs bands song et al 2017 for the final computation of z eu multiple linear regression mlr model showed that the r rs band difference between b2 and b4 and between b3 and b5 may be used for successfully estimating k d par model performances were evaluated using the root mean squared error rmse and mean absolute percentage difference mapd values 6 r m s e 1 n i 1 n y i p y i m 2 7 m a p d 100 n i 1 n y i p y i m y i m where yp is the predicted value ym is the measured value and n is the sample number slope and r2 values between in situ r rs and s2a s2b msi r rs bands were computed to analyze the uncertainties associated with the atmospheric correction of s2a s2b msi images we also followed a partition sorting approach viscarra rossel et al 2006 to divide the entire dataset n 61 into 41 calibration and 20 validation subsets by first arranging k d par values in ascending order and then selecting every 3rd sample as the validation samples n 20 and remaining as calibration samples n 41 therefore 20 fold cross validation method was adopted to evaluate model performance using rmse and mapd as the accuracy measures linear logarithmic power and exponential relationships were calibrated and corresponding r2 rmse and mapd values in the validation datasets were estimated fig 2 shows the overall framework of the study to estimate zeu from s2a s2b r rs data capability to estimate k d par from s2a s2b msi data offers an opportunity to estimate spatio temporal variability of z eu of the chilika lagoon for temporal assessment the seasons were classified into pre monsoon march june monsoon july october and post monsoon november february seasons with the availability of frequent cloud free s2a s2b data we estimated z eu values across the lagoon for all the 85 msi acquisition dates however the number of cloud free days during the monsoon period was generally less seasonal variation of z eu values was assessed by averaging z eu values for each water pixels of the chilika lagoon we selected images with 10 cloud cover in the s2a s2b msi scene with no cloud cover over the chilika lagoon for pre monsoon and post monsoon in case of monsoon season cloud cover over the selected s2a s2b msi scene was not more than 30 with negligible cloud cover over the chilika lagoon high resolution maps of z eu were generated for these three major seasons temporal mean in spatial scale mean z eu of all the pixels in each image s2a s2b msi acquisition date was also calculated to get the temporal dynamics of z eu spatial mean in temporal scale to analyze the spatial variability of z eu values the lagoon was divided into four different sectors the northern sector freshwater zone southern sector saline zone central sector brackish zone and the outer channel sector saline zone pal and mohanty 2002 ghosh and pattnaik 2005 seasonal pattern of z eu in each sector were estimated also the areal coverage of each sector was classified into two classes based on the z eu z ratio when the estimated ratio exceeds 1 0 it suggests that light can reach to the sediment bed or bottom depth of the water column which is suitable for aquatic plant growth 3 results 3 1 in situ data table 2 lists the descriptive statistics for spm chl a zsd and water depth values measured at different sampling locations in the chilika lagoon sampling locations were distributed over about 60 of the total area covering the central and northern part of the lagoon fig 1 salinity values measured with the wetlab s sbe37 sensor ranged 0 20 to 1 91 psu in the northern sector and 0 14 to 7 95 psu in the central sector during our field campaigns sea water entry through the mouth fig 1 along the outer channel increases salinity in the central sector and the freshwater from the tributaries along the northern and western catchments contribute to low salinity in the northern sector measured water depth values ranged from 0 80 m to 2 50 m which suggested that the sampled areas of the lagoon are shallow rampant fishing activities in such shallow areas are expected to create high turbidity as is evident from the observed spm values range 12 2 to 99 0 mg l 1 measured z sd values ranged from 0 15 to 1 25 m with an exponential relationship with the corresponding spm contents r2 0 60 n 61 based on pre and post monsoon measurements jally et al 2020 reported spm concentrations to range from 5 3 to 289 1 mg l 1 with z sd in the range of 0 10 to 1 81 m in the chilika lagoon because our sampling was done during the post monsoon periods the observed ranges could be less compared to those reported by jally et al 2020 table 2 also shows that chl a values ranged from 0 003 to 72 8 mg m 3 mean value 7 1 mg m 3 only four sampling locations had chl a concentrations above 20 mg m 3 variations in chl a contents in the range of 3 4 to 17 7 mg m 3 during 2011 ganguly et al 2015 and 3 4 to 39 6 mg m 3 during 2013 to 2014 sahoo et al 2017 have been reported for the lagoon measured a λ values at 25 out of 61 sampling locations in the chilika lagoon showed an exponentially decreasing trend with the increase in wavelength values fig 3 a typically seen with the turbid water dominated by cdom or non algal matter röttgers et al 2013 the a spectra measured in situ varied with spm contents for instance a values at 490 nm ranged from 0 42 m 1 to 9 10 m 1 with corresponding spm values in the range of 18 3 mg l 1 to 99 0 mg l 1 estimated k d 490 and k d par values showed large variations with the coefficient of variation cv of 84 and 64 respectively values of k d 490 ranged from 1 7 m 1 to 17 7 m 1 with a mean value of 5 4 m 1 estimated k d par values ranged from 1 8 m 1 to 10 74 m 1 with the mean value of 3 9 m 1 corresponding z eu values varied from 0 43 m to 2 56 m which shows the characteristics of typical shallow and turbid water in the chilika lagoon the r rs spectra fig 3b showed typical features observed in turbid water condition where the peak reflectance values varied from 0 008 to 0 065 sr 1 with near 10 fold change in corresponding spm concentrations 12 2 to 99 0 mg l 1 similarly the peak reflectance values were seen over the green to red regions 557 to 583 nm instead of blue region typically observed with the ocean water fig 4 a shows the relationship between k d 490 and k d par in the chilika lagoon which is similar to those observed for the taihu lake in china zhang et al 2012 and naivasha lake in kenya majozi et al 2014 estimated k d par and z sd values also closely match those from the irish sea york river and bons sinai fig 4b obtained from the archives of william mary s scholarworks bowers et al 2020 the dataset of bowers et al 2020 follows a power relationship k d par 1 54 zsd 0 98 similar relationship was also observed by lee et al 2018 with a global dataset where k d par 1 48 zsd 1 when validated with the chilika lagoon dataset n 25 the relationship yielded a rmse value of 1 3 m 1 and mapd of 23 for k d par because of such close match with several published datasets we used our developed model to estimate k d par values using the measured z sd at the remaining 36 sampling locations where optical data could not be recorded resulting k d par estimates for these 36 locations ranged from 1 3 m 1 to 6 2 m 1 with the mean value of 2 4 m 1 corresponding zeu values ranged from 0 7 m to 3 6 m with the mean value of 2 3 m for these 36 sampling locations overall for 61 sampling locations zeu showed power function relationship with spm r2 0 54 although no strong correlation was observed between z eu and chl a an exponential relationship between z eu and chl a r2 0 53 was observed when locations with chl a values exceeding 20 mg m 3 were excluded from the dataset 3 2 development of empirical models for zeu based on rrs 3 2 1 selection of band variables from rrs data for estimating zeu with no global retrieval model available for k d par and z eu for shallow and turbid inland waters we used multiple models table 1 to estimate k d par and z eu values using r rs values of s2a s2b msi equivalent bands out of six different models m2 showed best performance with the lowest rmse 1 81 m 1 and mapd 48 followed by m3 rmse 2 15 m 1 model performance also varies with the atmospheric correction algorithms used and the type of satellite sensors therefore we examined k d par and z eu relationships table 1 with different r rs band variables single band band ratios and band difference derived from s2a s2b msi fig 4a shows that k d par may be estimated from the band ratio of b4 to b2 with the highest r2 value 0 78 the band ratio of b1 to b4 yielded r2 value of 0 67 fig 5 e and the least r2 value of 0 30 was observed for the ratio of b3 to b2 fig 5b similar r2 values 0 74 and 0 75 were observed for b4 fig 4c and for band difference of b2 and b4 fig 4d while estimating k d par in general these best performing band variables in m1 to m6 for the chilika lagoon with s2a s2b msi r rs data are different from those originally used while developing these models the time difference between s2a s2b msi and in situ measurements 2 days may have added some uncertainty secondly the chl a concentration is lower in the chilika lagoon compared to the specific waterbodies for which models m1 and m6 were proposed also more in situ data should be collected in various seasons because of the difference in seasonal bio optical properties based on the oacs concentrations reported by previous studies and in situ measurement conducted in this study it is evident that spm is the dominant oac in the chilika lagoon therefore optical properties may be governed by the spm for entire year and uncertainty produced by limited seasonal in situ measurements may be neglected nevertheless it is necessary to evaluate different combination of s2a s2b msi r rs band variables for more accurate estimation of k d par because of the optically complex nature of the chilika lagoon 3 2 2 estimation of zeu using selected band variables table 3 shows different r rs bands band ratios and band differences calibrated and validated with s2a s2b msi data for predicting k d par in the chilika lagoon modeling analysis showed that b4 b5 and band difference between b2 and b4 performed better than other band variables the r rs bands b4 and b5 showed r2 values of 0 77 and 0 78 respectively for the calibration dataset the r rs band b4 showed rmse of 1 25 m 1 and mapd of 25 for the validation dataset band difference of b2 and b4 showed similar r2 value of 0 78 with the calibration dataset however higher rmse 1 34 m 1 and mapd 25 values were observed with band difference of b2 and b4 variable with the validation dataset these results indicate that the simple single variable model from s2a s2b msi data can be used to estimate k d par in the chilika lagoon however uncertainties associated with atmospheric correction needed to be assessed as single band values exhibit higher uncertainty compared to band ratio and band difference parameters fig 6 shows the overall comparison between in situ r rs at 443 492 560 665 and 704 nm with s2a s2b msi derived r rs for a single bands b band ratios and c band differences shown in table 3 in general models developed with band differences exhibited the lowest uncertainty high r2 and large slope value for s2a s2b msi b4 r rs vs in situ r rs associated with atmospheric correction with overall slope value of 0 68 and r2 of 0 82 fig 6c single bands showed the highest uncertainty slope 0 56 r2 0 67 uncertainty associated with band ratios are higher than those for band differences although single band model based on b5 table 3 showed the lowest rmse and mapd s2a s2b msi b5 showed slope of 0 51 when compared with in situ r rs at 704 nm slope value of 0 61 was observed between s2a s2b msi b4 and in situ r rs at 665 nm on the other hand band difference of b2 and b4 showed slope of 0 70 when compared with the in situ r rs difference at 492 and 665 nm therefore single band models may produce higher uncertainties than band ratio or band difference based models under different atmospheric conditions we selected all the s2a s2b msi r rs band ratios and band differences table 1 as variables in the mlr for predicting k d par single r rs bands were not included to avoid uncertainties associated with atmospheric correction stepwise forward and backward variable selection were carried out based on p value 0 05 in the mlr analysis variables b2 b4 and b3 b5 were selected for both stepwise and forward selection in case of backward selection 3 band difference variables were selected modeling results showed similar performance for both the set of variables with r2 value 0 89 and standard error of 0 93 both the models also showed similar validation performance therefore we selected the following mlr model with two variables b2 b4 and b3 b5 for estimating k d par 8 k d p a r 2 57 422 03 b 2 b 4 128 55 b 3 b 5 fig 7 a shows the calibration and validation performance of eq 8 with residual errors shown in fig 7b the new mlr model showed improved rmse of 1 09 m 1 with the validation dataset when compared with single variable band ratio or band difference models to predict k d par improved mapd value of 22 was observed with the mlr model for validation dataset with lower uncertainty associated with atmospheric correction eq 8 was finally selected to estimate k d par to map z eu based on eq 1 3 3 spatio temporal dynamics of zeu in the chilika lagoon fig 8 a shows the spatial maps of mean seasonal zeu values in the chilika lagoon generated from s2a s2b msi data lowest zeu values in the northern sector of the lagoon are expected because of incoming sediment fluxes from five different rivulets of mahanadi system and several streams from the western catchment of the lagoon low z eu values in the eastern part and the outer channel near the sea mouth region of the lagoon also explain water mixing due to the tidal current from the bay of bengal boating activity along the managed route of regular ferry and regular dredging activities performed for maintaining the ferry route however low cv values can be observed in the outer channel throughout the year fig 8b fishing activities and wind driven sediment resuspension in shallow areas may be the reason behind low z eu values and high cvs fig 8b in the lagoon during pre monsoon period mukherjee et al 2018 and sahoo et al 2017 reported higher chlorophyll concentration and lower water depth during pre monsoon season in the central and southern sector of the lagoon compared to other seasons also s2a s2b msi derived mean z eu values for all the water pixels in each image acquisition date over the chilika lagoon were calculated fig 9 shows the temporal variation of z eu across the lagoon with maximum wind speed and daily rainfall downloaded from nasa data access viewer website and odisha rainfall monitoring system website https rainfall nic in pubrainchart asp respectively a decreasing trend from march april to may june and increasing trend from may june to october in z eu values during the occurrence of high wind speed and rainfall can be observed in fig 9 it can be observed that z eu is more strongly influenced by wind speed than rainfall because of shallow depth causing wind driven resuspension of sediment in the chilika lagoon analysis of sector wise z eu data showed a mean z eu value of 0 97 m during the monsoon season in the northern sector compared to mean z eu value of 1 02 m and 1 14 m in pre and post monsoon seasons respectively mean z eu value of 0 93 m 1 m and 1 31 m were observed in the outer channel during pre monsoon monsoon and post monsoon seasons respectively however mean z eu value in the central sector reduces to 1 42 m in the pre monsoon season from 1 98 m in post monsoon season mean z eu value of 1 68 m was observed in the central sector during monsoon season higher z eu values were observed in the southern sector of the lagoon compared to other sectors with mean values of 1 51 m 2 25 m and 2 18 m during pre monsoon monsoon and post monsoon seasons respectively overall similar trend can be observed in the central sector and outer channel of the lagoon where z eu gradually increases from pre to post monsoon seasons fig 10 a however northern and southern sectors of the lagoon showed a complete opposite trend where zeu is the lowest in northern sector and highest in southern sector during monsoon season increase in water depth but no sediment transport from northern sector to southern sector may be the reason behind such an opposite trend as the mean seasonal z in all the four sectors of chilika lagoon was reported by mukherjee et al 2018 we estimated zeu z ratio for the chilika lagoon we also estimated ratio of area where zeu z 1 a1 and zeu z 1 a0 for each sector fig 10b liu et al 2016 earlier showed that the proportion of macrophyte coverage increases with the increase in zeu z ratio the ratio of zeu z 1 indicates light reaching to the bottom which is ideal for the growth of submerged macrophytes therefore the ratio a1 a0 in each sector of the lagoon may give critical information of the macrophyte presence higher the ratio a1 a0 higher is the suitability of sub merged macrophyte growth fig 9c shows pictures of aquatic macrophytes captured during sampling campaigns in the chilika lagoon the lowest value of a1 a0 was observed in the outer channel of the chilika lagoon after outer channel northern sector showed low value of a1 a0 0 15 during pre monsoon 0 09 during monsoon and 0 06 during post monsoon 4 discussion euphotic depth is a key parameter used in characterizing underwater light environment in general light attenuation measurements may be used to estimate z eu specifically z eu may be readily estimated from k d par values which requires the downwelling irradiance e d be measured at multiple water depths most sensor assemblies required for measuring photometric and radiometric quantities are designed primarily for ocean water monitoring it becomes a challenging task to deploy such assemblies in inland waterbodies many of which are quite shallow the lack of modern boating facilities to carry heavy sensor assemblies such as iop and aop profilers adds to the challenge of obtaining e d depth profiles in the chilika lagoon nevertheless constantly improving spectral spatial and temporal resolutions of available remote sensing data provide opportunity to characterize water quality in eutrophic and inland waterbodies such as chilika lagoon with limited studies on underwater light interactions in turbid waterbodies involving s2a s2b msi we examined the capability of combining limited iop and aop measurements with s2a s2b data for estimating z eu values for the entire chilika lagoon much of the chilika lagoon is shallow its water is turbid with a salinity gradient extending from the bay of bengal through its mouth in the east to the fresh water in the west fed by several distributaries of the mahanadi river and small rivers from the western catchment interestingly shallow waterbodies from other parts of world show similar spm but higher chl a contents as compared to the chilika lagoon for instance about 10 70 mg l 1 spm and 12 9 128 63 mg m 3 chl a contents in taihu lake in china le et al 2009 4 81 61 0 mg l 1 spm and 9 8 153 9 mg m 3 chl a contents in suwa and kasumigaura lakes in japan yang et al 2013 and similar ranges in other shallow waterbodies pan et al 2015 xue et al 2019 have been reported low chl a values in the chilika lagoon may be because of constant river water influx from several streams from the western and northern side of the lagoon influx of river water maintains low salinity in the northern and western part of the lagoon while eastern part remains saline because of intrusion of sea water through the presence of a mouth along the bay of bengal as in the case of chilika lagoon high sediment concentration is reported to result in large reflectance values and shifting of r rs peak to the red and nir regions qiu 2013 li et al 2013 also have reported similar features for r rs spectra collected from the shitoukoumen reservoir in china that had spm and chl a concentrations in the range of 3 7 211 9 mg l 1 and 1 9 47 5 mg m 3 respectively measured absorption spectra and estimated k d values in the chilika lagoon were similar in magnitude to those reported from other inland waterbodies of the world for example ficek et al 2012 have reported similar a spectra for eutrophic water of pomeranian lakes poland majozi et al 2014 reported similar ranges of z eu 0 7 m to 2 7 m for the lake naivasha kenya and shi et al 2014 have reported similar k d par range 0 7 m 1 to 15 4 m 1 for the lake taihu china we estimated k d par values from a values measured at 400 to 700 nm at 25 different locations in the chilika lagoon we augmented small size of our datasets using the k d par and zsd values publicly available for the irish sea york river and bons sinai archived at the william mary s scholarworks with the developed relationship validated with k d par and z sd measurements k d par values were estimated for additional 36 locations the similarity observed between the k d par vs z sd in the chilika lagoon and those from other sediment dominated turbid inland waterbodies provided a reliable basis for developing s2a s2b msi based retrieval model for z eu next we examined and reparametrized the existing empirical models to estimate z eu values using different band variables constructed with the s2a s2b extracted r rs values resulting model performance in fig 5 clearly showed that models based only on a single band involve large uncertainties because of inaccuracies associated with atmospheric correction favoring the use of multivariate model developed using b2 b4 and b3 b5 as predictors for z eu with the capability to estimate k d par from s2a s2b msi data we further evaluated spatio temporal variability of z eu in the chilika lagoon we estimated z eu across the lagoon for 85 different acquisition dates between jan 2017 and jun 2021 seasonal variability of z eu in all the major sectors of chilika lagoon were assessed a decreasing trend in z eu value from march april to may june and increasing trend from may june to october coinciding high wind speed and rainfall events were observed from spatial mean of z eu for each s2a s2b msi image acquisition dates from the estimated temporal mean of zeu similar trends were observed in central sector and outer channel of the lagoon where z eu gradually increased from pre to post monsoon however northern and southern sectors of the lagoon showed a complete opposite trend where z eu was the lowest in the northern sector and highest in the southern sector during monsoon season increase in water depth but no sediment transport from the northern sector to southern sector because of the presence of submerged macrophyte in central and southern sectors may be the reason of such opposite trend interestingly the macrophyte presence closely followed the spatial trends in z eu in the chilika lagoon pattnaik et al 2020 reported that the outer channel remains mostly weed free whereas floating macrophytes are frequently present in the northern sector low value of a1 a0 in the northern sector may be driven by the nutrient rich sediment entering the lagoon explaining the presence of floating macrophytes higher value of a1 a0 in the central and southern sectors may be conducive to submerged macrophyte growth as also is reported by pattnaik et al 2020 the highest a1 a0 value of 4 5 was observed during the post monsoon season in the central sector whereas a1 a0 value of 1 47 was observed during the pre monsoon season in monsoon season a1 a0 value remained below 0 5 in all the sectors low a1 a0 value of 0 13 is observed in the southern sector during the pre monsoon season the linkage between the macrophyte presence with z eu merits a detailed and more extensive investigation specifically the possibility observed with the remote sensing data for macrophyte management may further be explored 5 conclusion knowledge of zeu plays a crucial role in studying biogeochemical cycles and ecosystem of our ecologically fragile inland water bodies such as the chilika lagoon capability to estimate k d par from s2a s2b msi data with efficient models offer an opportunity to monitor such fragile ecosystems in an efficient manner in this study we collected water quality parameters covering about 60 of the total area of the chilika lagoon coinciding the s2a s2b msi data acquisition schedule standard k d par and z eu models designed for turbid water were examined however such models failed to capture the observed trends primarily because of the difference in satellite sensor and bio optical complexity of chilika lagoon therefore we calibrated and validated different r rs band variables single bands band ratios and band differences of s2a s2b msi with k d par estimated in the chilika lagoon modeling results showed that r rs band variables involving b4 b5 and band difference between b2 and b4 performed better compared to other band variables in estimating k d par among single r rs bands b5 showed the least rmse 0 81 m 1 and mapd 24 when k d par was estimated in the validation dataset similarly b4 showed the rmse value of 1 25 m 1 and mapd of 25 similar rmse 1 34 m 1 and mapd 25 values were observed for band difference between b2 and b4 with the test dataset to predict k d par in general single r rs bands showed higher uncertainties associated with atmospheric correction compared to r rs band ratios and band differences stepwise forward and backward variable selection was also carried out to improve model performance using the mlr approach which resulted in r2 value of 0 80 and standard error of 0 93 the new mlr model showed rmse of 1 09 m 1 and improved mapd 22 to predict k d par with low uncertainty associated with atmospheric correction once the model was calibrated and validated s2a s2b msi data for the entire chilika lagoon for 85 different acquisition dates between jan 2017 and jun 2021 were processed to understand seasonal variability of z eu in all the major sectors of chilika lagoon a decreasing trend in z eu value from march april to may june and increasing trend from may june to october coinciding high wind speed and rainfall events were observed similar trends were observed in the central sector and the outer channel of the lagoon where z eu gradually increased from pre to post monsoon however northern and southern sectors of the lagoon showed a completely opposite trend possibly because of the extent of submerged macrophytes the macrophyte presence closely followed the spatial trends in z eu in the chilika lagoon these results present new opportunities for managing macrophytes using high spectral resolution remote sensing data in the chilika lagoon specifically high spatial and temporal resolution of sentinel msi data may be useful in monitoring ecological health of shallow and turbid inland water bodies credit authorship contribution statement sourav roy conceptualization data

3017,globally hydrographic basins are routinely contaminated by anthropogenic contaminants originating from coal mining swine farming urban sewage pesticide use and other various sources these contaminants not only spread pollution but also nanoparticles nps capable of contaminating the fauna and flora of estuaries in addition to being harmful to human health the use of images from the sentinel 3b olci ocean land color instrument satellite makes it possible to obtain spectral data aimed at identifying the presence of possible contamination in large regions which can be complemented by advanced electron microscopies the general objective of this study is to analyze the dispersion of nps and ultrafine particles ufps in a region that contains multiple contaminants through the use of images from the sentinel 3b olci satellite the authors examined images taken after two particularly intense tropical rain events in december 2018 and 2021 in the region of the laguna estuary located in the brazilian state of santa catarina suspended sediments sss were collected from seventeen points on the tubarão river in 2018 these samples were then submitted to an analytical laboratory for various analyses such as x ray diffraction xrd and transmission and scanning electron microscopes additionally images from the sentinel 3b satellite olci in the laguna estuary region from 2018 and 2021 were analyzed based on the following variables water turbidity tsm nn chlorophyll a chl nn and suspended pollution potential adg 443 nn the sss demonstrated the presence of massive crystals of ultrafine pyrite in a pseudomorph crystal of jarosite containing nanospheres with hazardous elements e g as hg cd and pb which represent important pollutants the sentinel 3b olci images in relation to the variables tsm nn chl nn and adg 443 nn 2018 and 2021 identified high turbidity in the waters of the tubarão river analysis of sss and satellite images are suitable for identifying contaminants toxic to the marine ecosystem and human health on a global scale keywords metallic and organic pollution nanoparticles global scale estuary region hydrographic basin data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction estuaries play a fundamental role in maintaining healthy and diverse populations of fauna and flora in marine ecosystems worldwide li et al 2021 neckel et al 2021 contamination stemming from anthropic actions is increasing both in the immediate vicinity of and upland from these fundamental hydrological components causing disturbance to marine ecosystem dynamics li et al 2021 yang et al 2022 silva et al 2021 and neckel et al 2021 highlight that studies involving marine estuaries that enhance the identification of nanoparticles and ultrafine particles commonly harmful to the health of fauna flora and humans are of fundamental importance for the creation of new public policies aimed at mitigating environmental impacts impacts often caused by coal mining activity in places close to water resources coal s chemical structure contains hazardous elements capable of contaminating the environment such as sulfur polycyclic aromatic compounds metals and organometallics silva et al 2021 many of these compounds are capable of reacting in aqueous solution thus increasing the levels of acidity and toxicity of the water in both hydrographic basins and marine estuaries khadim et al 2020 such waters become extremely harmful to the environment containing ultrafine particles primarily of coal origin and secondary particulates jurado et al 2014 gasparotto et al 2021 yang et al 2021 gopinathan et al 2022 tang et al 2022 acidity levels from these contaminants can change the ph of the water causing population imbalances in marine fauna and flora jouini et al 2019 furthermore the incremental bioavailability of hazardous elements from coal extraction and coal power plants can generate carcinogenic contamination of local water bodies cheung et al 2021 panta et al 2022 the existence of geochemical studies capable of verifying the presence of contaminants from coal exploration in regions of marine estuaries is noted however nanoparticles derived from coal often contain dangerous elements further contaminating resources tou et al 2021 zhao et al 2022 it is worth remembering that geochemical analyses performed on suspended sediments in marine estuaries enhance local results that can vary considerably depending on the water s velocity responsible for transporting sediments that may contain chlorophyll suspended solids and various contaminants neckel et al 2021 zhao et al 2022 another advantage of remote sensing data is the extensive spatial and temporal coverage it offers zhang and lin 2022 therefore the importance of geospatial studies with satellite analysis applied to large regions is highlighted as this allows greater reliability of the results when related to the dispersion of nanoparticles in estuaries ngowo et al 2021 oiry and barillé 2021 thus we emphasize the importance of studies in hydrographic basins and marine estuaries using the sentinel 3b olci satellite which serves as one of the most advanced technological tools to examine the presence of and dispersion of nanoparticles in the hydrography of large regions with the use of the representation of particulate elements by colors for a better didactic visualization of the study targets petus et al 2019 liu et al 2021 neckel et al 2021 tilstone et al 2019 tilstone et al 2021 vanhellemont and ruddick 2021 according to xue et al 2019 liu et al 2021 neckel et al 2021 and vanhellemont and ruddick 2021 when analyzing the level of turbidity in a body of water in order to quantify the amount of particles in suspension the chlorophyll a level is related to the quantity of algae present suspended pollution potential refers to the quantity of ultra fine particulate matter dissolved in the water liu et al 2021 neckel et al 2021 both are variables of extreme importance in carrying out studies aimed at quantifying the overall quality of the water resource almost always related to land use issues in the region what justifies the importance of this study aimed at the waters of the laguna marine estuary brazil that flows into the atlantic ocean is that it is located in a region in which coal mining and transportation are common in addition to being one of the largest areas of hog farming in brazil rodriguez iruretagoiena et al 2016 silva et al 2020 coupled with a high population index the anthropogenic environmental impact in this region is significant silva et al 2020 following the brazilian oil crisis that existed between 2006 and 2016 coal use and extraction experienced a new political and financial peak which increased its extraction within the tubarão river watershed and its use in a coal fired power plant close to the laguna estuary region rodriguez iruretagoiena et al 2016 coal s future in the region however has changed considerably in recent years rodriguez iruretagoiena et al 2016 a slew of environmental lawsuits in both brazilian and international courts coupled with a regional loss of interest has decreased the attractiveness of coal since 2016 rodriguez iruretagoiena et al 2016 silva et al 2020 this abrupt abandonment of coal leaves open pit extraction mines in areas that need intense environmental recovery for greater protection of human health rodriguez iruretagoiena et al 2016 the general objective of this study is to analyze the dispersion of nps and ufps in the tubarão river watershed including the laguna estuary after intense tropical rains in december 2018 and the estuary s current state 2021 through the use of images from the sentinel 3b olci satellite to complement the results obtained from samples analyzed by advanced electron microscopy in addition to analyzing the dispersion of these particles this study also offers a new approach at looking at the presence of possible contaminants in water resources globally an approach capable of combining new data from remote sensing with terrestrial samples collected in the field thus presenting more real and useful data for future planning and macro scale environmental recovery planning 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the tubarão river watershed is part of the laguna estuary latitude 28 4826 and longitude 48 7815 located in the state of santa catarina brazil with a drainage area of 4728 km2 which empties into the atlantic ocean rodriguez iruretagoiena et al 2016 ibge 2021 fig 1 the tubarão river watershed region is responsible for the public water supply for approximately 330 000 inhabitants in the following brazilian cities capivari de baixo 25 477 inhabitants imaruí 9 764 inhabitants jaguarauna 20 547 inhabitants laguna 46 424 inhabitants lauro muller 15 380 people orleans 21 161 people pedras grandes 3 931 people treze de maio 7 104 people tubarão 10 143 people pescaria brava 10 225 people gravatal 6 621 people são ludgero 13 886 inhabitants braço do norte 32 294 inhabitants and ibituba 40 170 inhabitants ibge 2021 one of the major factors that stimulated the economic growth of the laguna region was the coal mining activities of the late 19th century rodriguez iruretagoiena et al 2016 silva et al 2020 abcm 2021 in addition to industrial pottery and pig farming during 1885 the dona tereza cristina railroad was inaugurated created to connect the region to the port of laguna guaranteeing the export of mineral coal to the rest of brazil and other countries abcm 2021 from 2006 to 2016 coal mining in laguna ensured high levels of employment for the population rodriguez iruretagoiena et al 2016 after 2016 with the brazilian coal crisis most coal mines were abandoned without environmental restoration or recovery silva et al 2020 the study area experienced periods of unusually high rainfall in both 2016 and 2018 inmet 2021 these excessive rains flooded many of the abandoned coal mines dispersing coal particulates throughout the tubarão river watershed according to some studies heavy rains can mobilize nps containing metals and organic contaminants in watersheds in different regions of the world rodriguez iruretagoiena et al 2016 silva et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 it is assumed that the nps are not just from the coal mines as the area also houses agricultural areas in which cattle and swine are reared these areas were also flooded during the heavy 2018 rains in the laguna estuary alava et al 2021 neckel et al 2021 and perumal and muthuramalingam 2021 have identified and examined nps and highly contaminating ufps in estuaries compromising the environment and the sustainability of several vital regions for the human survival 2 2 geospatial procedures collections and analysis the sediment collection carried out in the field in december 2018 consisted of 17 points sampled on the tubarão river the main river of the estuary with distances ranging from 300 to 800 m between the points sampled according to rodriguez iruretagoiena et al 2016 and neckel et al 2021 the spacing of 300 to 1000 m from each collection point makes it possible to carry out real macro analyzes in hydrographic regions for an adequate understanding of a given area the collected samples were placed in sterilized containers and stored in a styrofoam box lopes et al 2009 che zulkifli et al 2020 afterward they were immediately sent to laboratories for proper preparation and analysis within a period of less than 24 h as recommended by lopes et al 2009 and che zulkifli et al 2020 analysis by x ray diffraction xrd was performed on the sampled sss which allowed the identification of the structure of mineralogical phases alderton 2021 hassaan and el nemr 2021 the collected sediment was passed through the powder diffractometer panalytical xpert pro rodriguez iruretagoiena et al 2016 anand et al 2019 mejdi et al 2020

alderton 2021 hassaan and el nemr 2021 the fib sem was also used with 2 beams of electrons and ions focused on coincident points zhou et al 2018 sexton et al 2021 and high resolution transmission electron microscopy hr tem applied to study the structures of the nps present in the sampled sss the geospatial analysis was divided into the following methodological stages the first stage of the research refers to the analysis of collection points in the laguna estuary in december 2018 using sentinel 3b olci satellite images collected in the same period as the collections carried out the field the second stage is the analysis of the water quality of the laguna estuary with reflectance analysis obtained by the sentinel 3b olci satellite this enabled the authors to quantify the pollutants in a given region and allowed for greater reliability in relation to the identification of levels of particulate matter in the laguna estuary for this study the authors focused on identification of the presence of particulates in the water of the laguna estuary and the atlantic ocean in the state of santa catarina brazil using unprecedented images from the sentinel 3b olci satellite coupled with capable water full resolution wfr with the use of satellite images based on neural network nn algorithms characterized as an appropriate processor to study the optical water level in full resolution the sentinel 3b olci satellite was utilized in this study as it was necessary to use s3b images where the optical mapping sensors captured the tubarão river estuary more clearly with less cloud cover during 2018 and 2021 sentinel 3a however analyzed the study area only until 2018 this combination provided daily global images based on the ocean s reflectance color with a resolution of 300 m obtained from the european space agency s esa eumetsat data portal in partnership with the national aeronautics and space administration nasa the criterion for selection of satellite images for the study was a low percentage of clouds in images dated december 10 2018 shortly after a period of heavy rains and december 12 2021 the low cloud factor in the images from satellites allowed the researchers to better detail and analyze the levels of particulates in the water through the reflectance of the earth s surface rodríguez benito et al 2020 donlon et al 2021 fernandez moran et al 2021 mikelsons and wang 2021 seegers et al 2021 the processing of data from the sentinel 3b olci satellite images was performed in snap sentinel application platform software version 8 0 4 european space agency to verify the water quality considering the variables tsm nn chl nn and adg 443 nn the analysis points for this study were collected directly from the sentinel 3b olci images in the snap software the sentinel 3b olci images correspond to images already calibrated by the esa containing the normalized mean square error of 0 83 µg mg totaling 6 62 error thus generating spreadsheets with statistical data to be modeled in the jasp software version 0 14 1 0 jasp workshops the satellite collection points were positioned on the lagoons at the mouth of the tubarão river and in the coastal region of the atlantic ocean seventeen points were collected on two separate dates december 10 2018 and december 12 2021 at each of the 17 points sampled in the satellite images geochemical collections were taken in the field this allowed us to compare the results of field collections with those of satellite images donlon et al 2021 fernandez moran et al 2021 mikelsons and wang 2021 seegers et al 2021 the data collected from satellite images from 2018 and 2021 were subjected to k means grouping aimed at verifying the water quality of all areas sampled in relation to their statistical similarities organized in a single database of dice the database was composed of information from tsm nn chl nn and adg 443 nn the analyses were performed using jasp software version 0 14 1 0 considering that the k means cluster is an algorithm based on the optimization of data vectors between the clusters with minimization which enables the understanding of the results based on the centroids maroni et al 2021 the position of the centroids is recalculated and updated as the barycenter of the resulting clusters with the application of the algorithm which seeks to partition the data space with the ideal sum of squares error sse locally within the cluster maroni et al 2021 martín santamaría et al 2022 abdalameer et al 2022 the cases are then assigned to the nearest centroid calculated as the mean of the assigned data points based on the silhouette index zhu and xu 2018 martín santamaría et al 2022 the silhouette index displays the average internal consistency of the cluster by evaluating how similar each case is with respect to its own cluster or other categorized clusters zhu and xu 2018 naghizadeh and metaxas 2020 for silhouette scores the closer it is to the upper limit of 1 the more consistent the grouping will be with more reliable results while silhouette scores closer to the lower limit of 1 indicate incorrect consistency naghizadeh and metaxas 2020 maroni et al 2021 3 results and discussion 3 1 field samplings the sampling results of the 17 field collection points carried out in december 2018 after the period of flooding in the laguna estuary showed an abundance of multiple amorphous phases crystalline and organometallics in the sss where the presence of hydroxides was detected e g goethite and gibbsite along with sulfates jarosite and gypsum containing high amounts of hazardous elements table 1 rodriguez iruretagoiena et al 2016 also utilizing fib sem in the tubarão river detected the following hazardous elements lead cadmium arsenic manganese uranium among others associated with hydroxides and sulfates these multiple phases containing crystalline and amorphous particulates in the form of nps couple dangerous elements with the structure of several compounds hoang and ganguli 2012 kasinathan et al 2021 salim et al 2021 regarding hydroxides goethite consists of iron oxide minerals presenting a greater capacity to absorb pollutants that are toxic to marine ecosystems and human health bhatt et al 2021 neckel et al 2021 peng et al 2021 the presence of sulfate containing hazardous elements and organic compounds is associated with the oxidation of iron sulfides in addition to the degradation of some clays and carbonates present in coal with a high degree of toxicity to the environment and the population rodriguez iruretagoiena et al 2016 li et al 2018 vandana et al 2022 fig 2 a illustrates the presence of massive ultra fine pyrite crystals and on the right side a pseudomorph jarosite crystal containing nanospheres with as hg cd and pb such elements probably derive from the geochemical reactions of sulfides carbonates and some clays widely detected in the sampled points especially in the tubarão river s head waters in lauro muller the identification of pyrite became possible with the use of fib sem also containing the presence of clusters of amorphous phases and mostly jarosite according to dai et al 2021 and wang et al 2021 the occurrence of pyrite is normal in coal fines due to this it becomes evident that both coal mining and coal power plants have potential serious implications on the surrounding environment of the contamination detected in this study several minerals e g sulphides like pyrite are not found naturally in the surrounding environment and are present only in coal as the only local source of such minerals that were widely detected in the obtained samples table 1 it can be inferred that their presence resulted directly from contamination released by the coal fig 2 b shows the existence of organic nps detected in the analyzed sediments containing cr and ti such elements likely result from the decomposition of minerals such as anatase rutile clays or from the association of organic matter present in coal fines dai et al 2020 toboła and botor 2020 huang et al 2021 moura et al 2021 shangguan et al 2021 viney et al 2021 in any case the tubarão river basin has been heavily impacted by coal mines in addition to ceramic industrial agricultural swine and urban wastes for fernandes et al 2019 dufresne et al 2020 jiang et al 2021 khadim et al 2021 viney et al 2021 and radcliffe 2022 despite considering the environmental impacts caused by several activities in hydrological environments the coal nps cannot be considered solely responsible for the attribution of hazardous elements in hydrographic regions due to the existence of activities related to livestock agriculture and industrial activities responsible for the direct release of waste into rivers which can contaminate large regions depending on the flow velocity and its coverage up to and including ocean waters fig 2 c highlights the presence of an amorphous nps cluster containing major elements such as al si and k in addition to minor elements such as la th y and ce these majority and minority agglomerates may be the result of the degradation of monazite and xenotime due to the high proportion of sulfuric acid and a strongly oxidizing environment in coal mine drainages dai et al 2021 the presence of different clays e g fig 3 may be one of the main reasons for the formation of minerals such as jarosite in addition to multiple amorphous phases capable of adsorbing different contaminants another possible factor that can justify the presence of elements such as la th y and ce according to akinyemi et al 2021 and moura et al 2021 consists of the degradation of organic matter in the coal that contains such elements that are dangerous to the environment and harmful to human health 3 2 geospatial assessment with sentinel 3b olci satellite imagery fig 4 consists of representations of the compositions of the sentinel 3b olci satellite images applied to water resources in the region under study considering the december 2018 following heavy rains and 2021 images recorded by the weather station located in the city of laguna december 10 2018 had an average air temperature of 17 2 c and an average relative humidity of 71 inmet 2021 the weather conditions on december 12 2021 were as follows rainfall was 0 06 mm average air temperature dry bulb was 23 04 c with average relative humidity of 90 total 2018 annual precipitation for the city was recorded as 639 6 mm this annual rainfall amount had drastically changed by 2021 which recorded an 11 month total of only 230 2 mm from january 1st through november 30th inmet 2021 annual data show that the year 2018 had rainfall derived floods while 2021 corresponded to periods of lack of high rainfall this made it possible to assess the presence of contaminating elements and dangerous nps in dispersed sss during periods of high rainfall fig 4 a and b shows a clear difference in water turbidity between the years 2018 and 2021 water turbidity tsm nn was widely dispersed and had a high intensity in the period analyzed in 2018 in december 2021 the only areas in which this was found were the mirim and garopaba sul lagoons located in the region of the laguna estuary represented by the red color fig 4 c and d shows the difference in the material dissolved on the surface adg 443 nn of the lakes the mouth of the tubarão river and the oceanic shore our analysis shows that 2018 had higher levels of particulate matter nps and ufps when compared to the year 2021 the levels of adg 443 nn showed greater reflectance intensity at the ocean shore according to neckel et al 2021 high concentrations of dissolved particulate matter in oceanic surface waters containing nps with possible harmful contaminants to marine fauna and flora are easily spread through ocean currents as for chl nn concentrations fig 4 e and f there are high differences in water quality in fig 4 f mirim imaruí garopaba do sul and jaguaruna lagoons have high concentrations of chlorophyll a which represents the degree of impact of sedimentation this may be related to the presence of concentrated particulates at the bottom of these water resources which may have resulted from the floods that occurred in the region of the laguna estuary for casabianca et al 2021 the particles accumulated at the bottom of water sources support the development of phytoplankton table 2 displays a statistical description of the data collected from the compositions of the sentinel 3b olci satellite images where the variable tsm nn showed averages in 2018 that corresponded to 44 365 g m3 and in 2021 it was found to be 17 591 g m3 the variability of this standard deviation was higher in 2018 with a value of 30 30941 followed by 10 300 in the period analyzed in 2021 regarding the maximum reflectance identified with the use of satellite sentinel 3b olci images in relation to the period analyzed 2018 had 100 0 g m3 and 2021 had 34 125 g m3 due to the fact that the water remained less turbid and more clarified which allowed a better reflectance analysis using satellite images xue et al 2019 liu et al 2021 vanhellemont and ruddick 2021 as for the chlorophyll a concentration variable chl nn in relation to the 2018 average it presented values of 10 154 m 3 and in 2021 the value was 7 088 m 3 this variability of chlorophyll a concentrations during the analyzed period demonstrates that high rainfall may have contributed to a higher concentration of chlorophyll the maximum reading was observed in 2021 with a value of 18 862 m 3 in 2018 the period following the intense rainfall event yielded a reading of 15 734 m 3 the reflectance of chlorophyll in less turbid water without flooding becomes more detailed and enables the identification of the presence of particulates and organic matter at the bottom of water sources mikelsons and wang 2021 seegers et al 2021 regarding the variable absorption of colored detrital and dissolved material at 443 nm adg 443 nn table 2 an analysis of the means yielded 2021 values of 3 200 m 1 whereas in 2018 the material value dissolved was 1 425 m 1 the variability of the standard deviation was greater in 2021 with 3 461 and in 2018 it was 0 848 these nps and ufps were identified in the water surface of the laguna estuary by reflectance with the use of s3b olci satellite images the flood period caused greater water movement with less material on the surface due to the material s mixture with water in times of flood there is less particulate matter on the surface and a greater amount located deeper in the water source in december 2021 the period without excessive flooding a greater concentration of pollution composed of nano and micro particles was concentrated at the bottom in these water sources when comparing the chemical analyses of sediments collected in the field in the same period the presence of hydroxides and sulfates related to coal mines was highlighted thus it is assumed that the flood waters would be displacing these dangerous elements and transporting them into rivers lakes and the ocean of the laguna estuary this therefore exhibits an increasing degree of environmental degradation as neckel et al 2021 have shown with the capacity to contaminate large oceanic regions the k means analysis presents the fit scores for the model where k 3 represents clusters for a set of data collected at the 17 points using sentinel 3b olci satellite imagery the r2 is the ratio between the sums of squares and the total sums of squares an r2 value close to 1 is perceived as a good fit this study s r2 value was 0 703 allowing for greater reliability of the sampled data naghizadeh and metaxas 2020 the akaike information criterion aic and bayesian information criterion bic responsible for measuring the adjusted quality of the statistical model showed better reliability abdalameer et al 2022 the silhouette index ranged from zero 0 to one 1 for k 3 clusters it was 0 41 demonstrating a regular tendency to cluster the clusters according to the established variables thus generating variability within each cluster in terms of the sum of squares with the proportion of heterogeneity explained within the cluster and the silhouette index with values of significant homogeneity abdalameer et al 2022 clusters 1 are more influenced by the material dissolved on the adg443 nn surface in 2018 and 2021 with an index of 1 04 and 1 95 respectively table 3 through fig 5 the interval for each variable is observed with the midpoint in relation to the scope of each cluster and its relation with each studied variable it can be seen in fig 5 a b and c that the points that make up clusters 1 and 2 have a very significant relationship with 2018 in relation to adg443 nn tms nn and chl nn demonstrating that the rainfall regime influences the evaluation of these three variables as measured in the composition of the s3b olci satellite images neckel et al 2021 fig 5 d represents adg443 nn from 2021 with high values demonstrating that at these points there is a concentration of dissolved material which may indicate greater water pollution by particulates in the laguna estuary region fig 5 e and f show respectively the chl nn and tms nn variables in the analyzed period of 2021 with higher mean values which may be related to the influence of urbanization and coal mines in the laguna estuary region rodriguez iruretagoiena et al 2016 fig 6 a and c demonstrates the density of the variables adg443 nn and tms nn from 2018 present a large amplitude demonstrating the influence of the rainfall regime between the analyzed periods from 2018 to 2021 in fig 6 b for variable chl nn from 2018 cluster 2 had a peak at level 1 in these collection points the presence of organic matter contributes to the development of phytoplankton mikelsons and wang 2021 seegers et al 2021 in fig 6 d it is observed that the adg443 nn of 2021 its clusters 2 and 3 at present elevations are more homogeneous in the sense of representing low dissolved material and presenting more clarified water through fig 6 e it is possible to observe the concentrations of chl nn from 2021 with a divergent behavior of the clusters as the three clusters present a tendency of duplicity in the occurrence of peaks this means that for this variable other clusters were potentially created as the points present specific chlorophyll a indices which are high in cluster 1 and lower in cluster 3 fig 6 f consists of the tms nn of 2021 represented by the elevation of cluster 1 representing the water pollution in the points that make up this cluster however cluster 3 presents homogeneity for low turbidity values of the water in the points collected in the region of the laguna estuary the results of the 17 clustered points were linked to the map for visualization fig 7 this location information makes it possible to understand the water quality related to image compositions from the sentinel 3b olci satellite in relation to the results of the cluster analysis cluster 1 corresponds to the collection points of the jaguarauna garopaba do sul and santa marta lakes which demand special attention from the government this cluster yielded high results of adg443 nn chl nn and tms nn in both analyzed periods cluster 2 had intermediate results regarding water quality and turbidity rodríguez benito et al 2020 and donlon et al 2021 attribute such readings to a high quantity of organic material and sediments cluster 3 had the lowest concentrations for all variables demonstrating that the points located in the atlantic ocean at the mouth of the tubarão river and in the center of the lakes compromise the water quality of the estuary region of lagoon due to the presence of nps and ufps the analysis of sediments collected in the field demonstrated the presence of hazardous elements harmful to human health in addition to fauna and flora in this case the analysis of the satellite sentinel 3b olci images allowed for a macro analysis contemplating the presence of these particles in a broader context of public health mikelsons and wang 2021 neckel et al 2021 and seegers et al 2021 have highlighted that anthropogenic particulate pollution is harmful to the environment and human health 4 conclusion the analyses of sediments collected in the field detected the presence of coal derived sulphides containing hazardous elements e g as hg se and cd hydroxides and sulphates showing their greater capacity to absorb pollutants that are toxic to marine ecosystems and harmful to human health the presented results confirm that coal mining and industrial and urban wastes are the main generators of water contamination in the laguna estuary due to the presence of contaminants and several nanoparticles containing hazardous elements which spread over the watershed of the tubarão river especially in periods of intense flooding the coal is contaminating the study site in a greater and more constant way especially in close proximity to the cities of lauro muller orleans urussanga caspivari de baixo and tubarão due to the existence of both coal mining activities and coal fired power plants comparing sediment elemental concentrations and nanoparticles found in this work with previous research conducted in the same regional area following the dry season the authors discovered higher values of cobalt chromium selenium vanadium barium and zinc and lower levels of molybdenum and lead sentinel 3b olci images contributed to the relation of variables tsm nn chl nn and adg 443 nn in the periods 2018 and 2021 noting the presence of turbidity chlorophyll a and the presence of nps and ufps in the hydrographic basin of the tubarão river and in the laguna estuary thus making it possible to relate the hazardous elements identified in the sediments collected in the field with the expansion of these suspended pollution particulates in nps through the use of sentinel 3b olci images when considering nuances found in this study such as contamination of the marine estuary by dangerous elements aggravated by floods combined with coal mining activities and captured by sediment analysis by field research and satellite images it is noted that this technique is suitable for the identification of terrestrial contaminants and is capable of being applied in future studies world wide credit authorship contribution statement alcindo neckel conceptualization funding acquisition marcos l s oliveira guilherme l

3017,globally hydrographic basins are routinely contaminated by anthropogenic contaminants originating from coal mining swine farming urban sewage pesticide use and other various sources these contaminants not only spread pollution but also nanoparticles nps capable of contaminating the fauna and flora of estuaries in addition to being harmful to human health the use of images from the sentinel 3b olci ocean land color instrument satellite makes it possible to obtain spectral data aimed at identifying the presence of possible contamination in large regions which can be complemented by advanced electron microscopies the general objective of this study is to analyze the dispersion of nps and ultrafine particles ufps in a region that contains multiple contaminants through the use of images from the sentinel 3b olci satellite the authors examined images taken after two particularly intense tropical rain events in december 2018 and 2021 in the region of the laguna estuary located in the brazilian state of santa catarina suspended sediments sss were collected from seventeen points on the tubarão river in 2018 these samples were then submitted to an analytical laboratory for various analyses such as x ray diffraction xrd and transmission and scanning electron microscopes additionally images from the sentinel 3b satellite olci in the laguna estuary region from 2018 and 2021 were analyzed based on the following variables water turbidity tsm nn chlorophyll a chl nn and suspended pollution potential adg 443 nn the sss demonstrated the presence of massive crystals of ultrafine pyrite in a pseudomorph crystal of jarosite containing nanospheres with hazardous elements e g as hg cd and pb which represent important pollutants the sentinel 3b olci images in relation to the variables tsm nn chl nn and adg 443 nn 2018 and 2021 identified high turbidity in the waters of the tubarão river analysis of sss and satellite images are suitable for identifying contaminants toxic to the marine ecosystem and human health on a global scale keywords metallic and organic pollution nanoparticles global scale estuary region hydrographic basin data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction estuaries play a fundamental role in maintaining healthy and diverse populations of fauna and flora in marine ecosystems worldwide li et al 2021 neckel et al 2021 contamination stemming from anthropic actions is increasing both in the immediate vicinity of and upland from these fundamental hydrological components causing disturbance to marine ecosystem dynamics li et al 2021 yang et al 2022 silva et al 2021 and neckel et al 2021 highlight that studies involving marine estuaries that enhance the identification of nanoparticles and ultrafine particles commonly harmful to the health of fauna flora and humans are of fundamental importance for the creation of new public policies aimed at mitigating environmental impacts impacts often caused by coal mining activity in places close to water resources coal s chemical structure contains hazardous elements capable of contaminating the environment such as sulfur polycyclic aromatic compounds metals and organometallics silva et al 2021 many of these compounds are capable of reacting in aqueous solution thus increasing the levels of acidity and toxicity of the water in both hydrographic basins and marine estuaries khadim et al 2020 such waters become extremely harmful to the environment containing ultrafine particles primarily of coal origin and secondary particulates jurado et al 2014 gasparotto et al 2021 yang et al 2021 gopinathan et al 2022 tang et al 2022 acidity levels from these contaminants can change the ph of the water causing population imbalances in marine fauna and flora jouini et al 2019 furthermore the incremental bioavailability of hazardous elements from coal extraction and coal power plants can generate carcinogenic contamination of local water bodies cheung et al 2021 panta et al 2022 the existence of geochemical studies capable of verifying the presence of contaminants from coal exploration in regions of marine estuaries is noted however nanoparticles derived from coal often contain dangerous elements further contaminating resources tou et al 2021 zhao et al 2022 it is worth remembering that geochemical analyses performed on suspended sediments in marine estuaries enhance local results that can vary considerably depending on the water s velocity responsible for transporting sediments that may contain chlorophyll suspended solids and various contaminants neckel et al 2021 zhao et al 2022 another advantage of remote sensing data is the extensive spatial and temporal coverage it offers zhang and lin 2022 therefore the importance of geospatial studies with satellite analysis applied to large regions is highlighted as this allows greater reliability of the results when related to the dispersion of nanoparticles in estuaries ngowo et al 2021 oiry and barillé 2021 thus we emphasize the importance of studies in hydrographic basins and marine estuaries using the sentinel 3b olci satellite which serves as one of the most advanced technological tools to examine the presence of and dispersion of nanoparticles in the hydrography of large regions with the use of the representation of particulate elements by colors for a better didactic visualization of the study targets petus et al 2019 liu et al 2021 neckel et al 2021 tilstone et al 2019 tilstone et al 2021 vanhellemont and ruddick 2021 according to xue et al 2019 liu et al 2021 neckel et al 2021 and vanhellemont and ruddick 2021 when analyzing the level of turbidity in a body of water in order to quantify the amount of particles in suspension the chlorophyll a level is related to the quantity of algae present suspended pollution potential refers to the quantity of ultra fine particulate matter dissolved in the water liu et al 2021 neckel et al 2021 both are variables of extreme importance in carrying out studies aimed at quantifying the overall quality of the water resource almost always related to land use issues in the region what justifies the importance of this study aimed at the waters of the laguna marine estuary brazil that flows into the atlantic ocean is that it is located in a region in which coal mining and transportation are common in addition to being one of the largest areas of hog farming in brazil rodriguez iruretagoiena et al 2016 silva et al 2020 coupled with a high population index the anthropogenic environmental impact in this region is significant silva et al 2020 following the brazilian oil crisis that existed between 2006 and 2016 coal use and extraction experienced a new political and financial peak which increased its extraction within the tubarão river watershed and its use in a coal fired power plant close to the laguna estuary region rodriguez iruretagoiena et al 2016 coal s future in the region however has changed considerably in recent years rodriguez iruretagoiena et al 2016 a slew of environmental lawsuits in both brazilian and international courts coupled with a regional loss of interest has decreased the attractiveness of coal since 2016 rodriguez iruretagoiena et al 2016 silva et al 2020 this abrupt abandonment of coal leaves open pit extraction mines in areas that need intense environmental recovery for greater protection of human health rodriguez iruretagoiena et al 2016 the general objective of this study is to analyze the dispersion of nps and ufps in the tubarão river watershed including the laguna estuary after intense tropical rains in december 2018 and the estuary s current state 2021 through the use of images from the sentinel 3b olci satellite to complement the results obtained from samples analyzed by advanced electron microscopy in addition to analyzing the dispersion of these particles this study also offers a new approach at looking at the presence of possible contaminants in water resources globally an approach capable of combining new data from remote sensing with terrestrial samples collected in the field thus presenting more real and useful data for future planning and macro scale environmental recovery planning 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the tubarão river watershed is part of the laguna estuary latitude 28 4826 and longitude 48 7815 located in the state of santa catarina brazil with a drainage area of 4728 km2 which empties into the atlantic ocean rodriguez iruretagoiena et al 2016 ibge 2021 fig 1 the tubarão river watershed region is responsible for the public water supply for approximately 330 000 inhabitants in the following brazilian cities capivari de baixo 25 477

factors that stimulated the economic growth of the laguna region was the coal mining activities of the late 19th century rodriguez iruretagoiena et al 2016 silva et al 2020 abcm 2021 in addition to industrial pottery and pig farming during 1885 the dona tereza cristina railroad was inaugurated created to connect the region to the port of laguna guaranteeing the export of mineral coal to the rest of brazil and other countries abcm 2021 from 2006 to 2016 coal mining in laguna ensured high levels of employment for the population rodriguez iruretagoiena et al 2016 after 2016 with the brazilian coal crisis most coal mines were abandoned without environmental restoration or recovery silva et al 2020 the study area experienced periods of unusually high rainfall in both 2016 and 2018 inmet 2021 these excessive rains flooded many of the abandoned coal mines dispersing coal particulates throughout the tubarão river watershed according to some studies heavy rains can mobilize nps containing metals and organic contaminants in watersheds in different regions of the world rodriguez iruretagoiena et al 2016 silva et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 it is assumed that the nps are not just from the coal mines as the area also houses agricultural areas in which cattle and swine are reared these areas were also flooded during the heavy 2018 rains in the laguna estuary alava et al 2021 neckel et al 2021 and perumal and muthuramalingam 2021 have identified and examined nps and highly contaminating ufps in estuaries compromising the environment and the sustainability of several vital regions for the human survival 2 2 geospatial procedures collections and analysis the sediment collection carried out in the field in december 2018 consisted of 17 points sampled on the tubarão river the main river of the estuary with distances ranging from 300 to 800 m between the points sampled according to rodriguez iruretagoiena et al 2016 and neckel et al 2021 the spacing of 300 to 1000 m from each collection point makes it possible to carry out real macro analyzes in hydrographic regions for an adequate understanding of a given area the collected samples were placed in sterilized containers and stored in a styrofoam box lopes et al 2009 che zulkifli et al 2020 afterward they were immediately sent to laboratories for proper preparation and analysis within a period of less than 24 h as recommended by lopes et al 2009 and che zulkifli et al 2020 analysis by x ray diffraction xrd was performed on the sampled sss which allowed the identification of the structure of mineralogical phases alderton 2021 hassaan and el nemr 2021 the collected sediment was passed through the powder diffractometer panalytical xpert pro rodriguez iruretagoiena et al 2016 anand et al 2019 mejdi et al 2020

electron microscopy hr tem applied to study the structures of the nps present in the sampled sss the geospatial analysis was divided into the following methodological stages the first stage of the research refers to the analysis of collection points in the laguna estuary in december 2018 using sentinel 3b olci satellite images collected in the same period as the collections carried out the field the second stage is the analysis of the water quality of the laguna estuary with reflectance analysis obtained by the sentinel 3b olci satellite this enabled the authors to quantify the pollutants in a given region and allowed for greater reliability in relation to the identification of levels of particulate matter in the laguna estuary for this study the authors focused on identification of the presence of particulates in the water of the laguna estuary and the atlantic ocean in the state of santa catarina brazil using unprecedented images from the sentinel 3b olci satellite coupled with capable water full resolution wfr with the use of satellite images based on neural network nn algorithms characterized as an appropriate processor to study the optical water level in full resolution the sentinel 3b olci satellite was utilized in this study as it was necessary to use s3b images where the optical mapping sensors captured the tubarão river estuary more clearly with less cloud cover during 2018 and 2021 sentinel 3a however analyzed the study area only until 2018 this combination provided daily global images based on the ocean s reflectance color with a resolution of 300 m obtained from the european space agency s esa eumetsat data portal in partnership with the national aeronautics and space administration nasa the criterion for selection of satellite images for the study was a low percentage of clouds in images dated december 10 2018 shortly after a period of heavy rains and december 12 2021 the low cloud factor in the images from satellites allowed the researchers to better detail and analyze the levels of particulates in the water through the reflectance of the earth s surface rodríguez benito et al 2020 donlon et al 2021 fernandez moran et al 2021 mikelsons and wang 2021 seegers et al 2021 the processing of data from the sentinel 3b olci satellite images was performed in snap sentinel application platform software version 8 0 4 european space agency to verify the water quality considering the variables tsm nn chl nn and adg 443 nn the analysis points for this study were collected directly from the sentinel 3b olci images in the snap software the sentinel 3b olci images correspond to images already calibrated by the esa containing the normalized mean square error of 0 83 µg mg totaling 6 62 error thus generating spreadsheets with statistical data to be modeled in the jasp software version 0 14 1 0 jasp workshops the satellite collection points were positioned on the lagoons at the mouth of the tubarão river and in the coastal region of the atlantic ocean seventeen points were collected on two separate dates december 10 2018 and december 12 2021 at each of the 17 points sampled in the satellite images geochemical collections were taken in the field this allowed us to compare the results of field collections with those of satellite images donlon et al 2021 fernandez moran et al 2021 mikelsons and wang 2021 seegers et al 2021 the data collected from satellite images from 2018 and 2021 were subjected to k means grouping aimed at verifying the water quality of all areas sampled in relation to their statistical similarities organized in a single database of dice the database was composed of information from tsm nn chl nn and adg 443 nn the analyses were performed using jasp software version 0 14 1 0 considering that the k means cluster is an algorithm based on the optimization of data vectors between the clusters with minimization which enables the understanding of the results based on the centroids maroni et al 2021 the position of the centroids is recalculated and updated as the barycenter of the resulting clusters with the application of the algorithm which seeks to partition the data space with the ideal sum of squares error sse locally within the cluster maroni et al 2021 martín santamaría et al 2022 abdalameer et al 2022 the cases are then assigned to the nearest centroid calculated as the mean of the assigned data points based on the silhouette index zhu and xu 2018 martín santamaría et al 2022 the silhouette index displays the average internal consistency of the cluster by evaluating how similar each case is with respect to its own cluster or other categorized clusters zhu and xu 2018 naghizadeh and metaxas 2020 for silhouette scores the closer it is to the upper limit of 1 the more consistent the grouping will be with more reliable results while silhouette scores closer to the lower limit of 1 indicate incorrect consistency naghizadeh and metaxas 2020 maroni et al 2021 3 results and discussion 3 1 field samplings the sampling results of the 17 field collection points carried out in december 2018 after the period of flooding in the laguna estuary showed an abundance of multiple amorphous phases crystalline and organometallics in the sss where the presence of hydroxides was detected e g goethite and gibbsite along with sulfates jarosite and gypsum containing high amounts of hazardous elements table 1 rodriguez iruretagoiena et al 2016 also utilizing fib sem in the tubarão river detected the following hazardous elements lead cadmium arsenic manganese uranium among others associated with hydroxides and sulfates these multiple phases containing crystalline and amorphous particulates in the form of nps couple dangerous elements with the structure of several compounds hoang and ganguli 2012 kasinathan et al 2021 salim et al 2021 regarding hydroxides goethite consists of iron oxide minerals presenting a greater capacity to absorb pollutants that are toxic to marine ecosystems and human health bhatt et al 2021 neckel et al 2021 peng et al 2021 the presence of sulfate containing hazardous elements and organic compounds is associated with the oxidation of iron sulfides in addition to the degradation of some clays and carbonates present in coal with a high degree of toxicity to the environment and the population rodriguez iruretagoiena et al 2016 li et al 2018 vandana et al 2022 fig 2 a illustrates the presence of massive ultra fine pyrite crystals and on the right side a pseudomorph jarosite crystal containing nanospheres with as hg cd and pb such elements probably derive from the geochemical reactions of sulfides carbonates and some clays widely detected in the sampled points especially in the tubarão river s head waters in lauro muller the identification of pyrite became possible with the use of fib sem also containing the presence of clusters of amorphous phases and mostly jarosite according to dai et al 2021 and wang et al 2021 the occurrence of pyrite is normal in coal fines due to this it becomes evident that both coal mining and coal power plants have potential serious implications on the surrounding environment of the contamination detected in this study several minerals e g sulphides like pyrite are not found naturally in the surrounding environment and are present only in coal as the only local source of such minerals that were widely detected in the obtained samples table 1 it can be inferred that their presence resulted directly from contamination released by the coal fig 2 b shows the existence of organic nps detected in the analyzed sediments containing cr and ti such elements likely result from the decomposition of minerals such as anatase rutile clays or from the association of organic matter present in coal fines dai et al 2020 toboła and botor 2020 huang et al 2021 moura et al 2021 shangguan et al 2021 viney et al 2021 in any case the tubarão river basin has been heavily impacted by coal mines in addition to ceramic industrial agricultural swine and urban wastes for fernandes et al 2019 dufresne et al 2020 jiang et al 2021 khadim et al 2021 viney et al 2021 and radcliffe 2022 despite considering the environmental impacts caused by several activities in hydrological environments the coal nps cannot be considered solely responsible for the attribution of hazardous elements in hydrographic regions due to the existence of activities related to livestock agriculture and industrial activities responsible for the direct release of waste into rivers which can contaminate large regions depending on the flow velocity and its coverage up to and including ocean waters fig 2 c highlights the presence of an amorphous nps cluster containing major elements such as al si and k in addition to minor elements such as la th y and ce these majority and minority agglomerates may be the result of the degradation of monazite and xenotime due to the high proportion of sulfuric acid and a strongly oxidizing environment in coal mine drainages dai et al 2021 the presence of different clays e g fig 3 may be one of the main reasons for the formation of minerals such as jarosite in addition to multiple amorphous phases capable of adsorbing different contaminants another possible factor that can justify the presence of elements such as la th y and ce according to akinyemi et al 2021 and moura et al 2021 consists of the degradation of organic matter in the coal that contains such elements that are dangerous to the environment and harmful to human health 3 2 geospatial assessment with sentinel 3b olci satellite imagery fig 4 consists of representations of the compositions of the sentinel 3b olci satellite images applied to water resources in the region under study considering the december 2018 following heavy rains and 2021 images recorded by the weather station located in the city of laguna december 10 2018 had an average air temperature of 17 2 c and an average relative humidity of 71 inmet 2021 the weather conditions on december 12 2021 were as follows rainfall was 0 06 mm average air temperature dry bulb was 23 04 c with average relative humidity of 90 total 2018 annual precipitation for the city was recorded as 639 6 mm this annual rainfall amount had drastically changed by 2021 which recorded an 11 month total of only 230 2 mm from january 1st through november 30th inmet 2021 annual data show that the year 2018 had rainfall derived floods while 2021 corresponded to periods of lack of high rainfall this made it possible to assess the presence of contaminating elements and dangerous nps in dispersed sss during periods of high rainfall fig 4 a and b shows a clear difference in water turbidity between the years 2018 and 2021 water turbidity tsm nn was widely dispersed and had a high intensity in the period analyzed in 2018 in december 2021 the only areas in which this was found were the mirim and garopaba sul lagoons located in the region of the laguna estuary represented by the red color fig 4 c and d shows the difference in the material dissolved on the surface adg 443 nn of the lakes the mouth of the tubarão river and the oceanic shore our analysis shows that 2018 had higher levels of particulate matter nps and ufps when compared to the year 2021 the levels of adg 443 nn showed greater reflectance intensity at the ocean shore according to neckel et al 2021 high concentrations of dissolved particulate matter in oceanic surface waters containing nps with possible harmful contaminants to marine fauna and flora are easily spread through ocean currents as for chl nn concentrations fig 4 e and f there are high differences in water quality in fig 4 f mirim imaruí garopaba do sul and jaguaruna lagoons have high concentrations of chlorophyll a which represents the degree of impact of sedimentation this may be related to the presence of concentrated particulates at the bottom of these water resources which may have resulted from the floods that occurred in the region of the laguna estuary for casabianca et al 2021 the particles accumulated at the bottom of water sources support the development of phytoplankton table 2 displays a statistical description of the data collected from the compositions of the sentinel 3b olci satellite images where the variable tsm nn showed averages in 2018 that corresponded to 44 365 g m3 and in 2021 it was found to be 17 591 g m3 the variability of this standard deviation was higher in 2018 with a value of 30 30941 followed by 10 300 in the period analyzed in 2021 regarding the maximum reflectance identified with the use of satellite sentinel 3b olci images in relation to the period analyzed 2018 had 100 0 g m3 and 2021 had 34 125 g m3 due to the fact that the water remained less turbid and more clarified which allowed a better reflectance analysis using satellite images xue et al 2019 liu et al 2021 vanhellemont and ruddick 2021 as for the chlorophyll a concentration variable chl nn in relation to the 2018 average it presented values of 10 154 m 3 and in 2021 the value was 7 088 m 3 this variability of chlorophyll a concentrations during the analyzed period demonstrates that high rainfall may have contributed to a higher concentration of chlorophyll the maximum reading was observed in 2021 with a value of 18 862 m 3 in 2018 the period following the intense rainfall event yielded a reading of 15 734 m 3 the reflectance of chlorophyll in less turbid water without flooding becomes more detailed and enables the identification of the presence of particulates and organic matter at the bottom of water sources mikelsons and wang 2021 seegers et al 2021 regarding the variable absorption of colored detrital and dissolved material at 443 nm adg 443 nn table 2 an analysis of the means yielded 2021 values of 3 200 m 1 whereas in 2018 the material value dissolved was 1 425 m 1 the variability of the standard deviation was greater in 2021 with 3 461 and in 2018 it was 0 848 these nps and ufps were identified in the water surface of the laguna estuary by reflectance with the use of s3b olci satellite images the flood period caused greater water movement with less material on the surface due to the material s mixture with water in times of flood there is less particulate matter on the surface and a greater amount located deeper in the water source in december 2021 the period without excessive flooding a greater concentration of pollution composed of nano and micro particles was concentrated at the bottom in these water sources when comparing the chemical analyses of sediments collected in the field in the same period the presence of hydroxides and sulfates related to coal mines was highlighted thus it is assumed that the flood waters would be displacing these dangerous elements and transporting them into rivers lakes and the ocean of the laguna estuary this therefore exhibits an increasing degree of environmental degradation as neckel et al 2021 have shown with the capacity to contaminate large oceanic regions the k means analysis presents the fit scores for the model where k 3 represents clusters for a set of data collected at the 17 points using sentinel 3b olci satellite imagery the r2 is the ratio between the sums of squares and the total sums of squares an r2 value close to 1 is perceived as a good fit this study s r2 value was 0 703 allowing for greater reliability of the sampled data naghizadeh and metaxas 2020 the akaike information criterion aic and bayesian information criterion bic responsible for measuring the adjusted quality of the statistical model showed better reliability abdalameer et al 2022 the silhouette index ranged from zero 0 to one 1 for k 3 clusters it was 0 41 demonstrating a regular tendency to cluster the clusters according to the established variables thus generating variability within each cluster in terms of the sum of squares with the proportion of heterogeneity explained within the cluster and the silhouette index with values of significant homogeneity abdalameer et al 2022 clusters 1 are more influenced by the material dissolved on the adg443 nn surface in 2018 and 2021 with an index of 1 04 and 1 95 respectively table 3 through fig 5 the interval for each variable is observed with the midpoint in relation to the scope of each cluster and its relation with each studied variable it can be seen in fig 5 a b and c that the points that make up clusters 1 and 2 have a very significant relationship with 2018 in relation to adg443 nn tms nn and chl nn demonstrating that the rainfall regime influences the evaluation of these three variables as measured in the composition of the s3b olci satellite images neckel et al 2021 fig 5 d represents adg443 nn from 2021 with high values demonstrating that at these points there is a concentration of dissolved material which may indicate greater water pollution by particulates in the laguna estuary region fig 5 e and f show respectively the chl nn and tms nn variables in the analyzed period of 2021 with higher mean values which may be related to the influence of urbanization and coal mines in the laguna estuary region rodriguez iruretagoiena et al 2016 fig 6 a and c demonstrates the density of the variables adg443 nn and tms nn from 2018 present a large amplitude demonstrating the influence of the rainfall regime between the analyzed periods from 2018 to 2021 in fig 6 b for variable chl nn from 2018 cluster 2 had a peak at level 1 in these collection points the presence of organic matter contributes to the development of phytoplankton mikelsons and wang 2021 seegers et al 2021 in fig 6 d it is observed that the adg443 nn of 2021 its clusters 2 and 3 at present elevations are more homogeneous in the sense of representing low dissolved material and presenting more clarified water through fig 6 e it is possible to observe the concentrations of chl nn from 2021 with a divergent behavior of the clusters as the three clusters present a tendency of duplicity in the occurrence of peaks this means that for this variable other clusters were potentially created as the points present specific chlorophyll a indices which are high in cluster 1 and lower in cluster 3 fig 6 f consists of the tms nn of 2021 represented by the elevation of cluster 1 representing the water pollution in the points that make up this cluster however cluster 3 presents homogeneity for low turbidity values of the water in the points collected in the region of the laguna estuary the results of the 17 clustered points were linked to the map for visualization fig 7 this location information makes it possible to understand the water quality related to image compositions from the sentinel 3b olci satellite in relation to the results of the cluster analysis cluster 1 corresponds to the collection points of the jaguarauna garopaba do sul and santa marta lakes which demand special attention from the government this cluster yielded high results of adg443 nn chl nn and tms nn in both analyzed periods cluster 2 had intermediate results regarding water quality and turbidity rodríguez benito et al 2020 and donlon et al 2021 attribute such readings to a high quantity of organic material and sediments cluster 3 had the lowest concentrations for all variables demonstrating that the points located in the atlantic ocean at the mouth of the tubarão river and in the center of the lakes compromise the water quality of the estuary region of lagoon due to the presence of nps and ufps the analysis of sediments collected in the field demonstrated the presence of hazardous elements harmful to human health in addition to fauna and flora in this case the analysis of the satellite sentinel 3b olci images allowed for a macro analysis contemplating the presence of these particles in a broader context of public health mikelsons and wang 2021 neckel et al 2021 and seegers et al 2021 have highlighted that anthropogenic particulate pollution is harmful to the environment and human health 4 conclusion the analyses of sediments collected in the field detected the presence of coal derived sulphides containing hazardous elements e g as hg se and cd hydroxides and sulphates showing their greater capacity to absorb pollutants that are toxic to marine ecosystems and harmful to human health the presented results confirm that coal mining and industrial and urban wastes are the main generators of water contamination in the laguna estuary due to the presence of contaminants and several nanoparticles containing hazardous elements which spread over the watershed of the tubarão river especially in periods of intense flooding the coal is contaminating the study site in a greater and more constant way especially in close proximity to the cities of lauro muller orleans urussanga caspivari de baixo and tubarão due to the existence of both coal mining activities and coal fired power plants comparing sediment elemental concentrations and nanoparticles found in this work with previous research conducted in the same regional area following the dry season the authors discovered higher values of cobalt chromium selenium vanadium barium and zinc and lower levels of molybdenum and lead sentinel 3b olci images contributed to the relation of variables tsm nn chl nn and adg 443 nn in the periods 2018 and 2021 noting the presence of turbidity chlorophyll a and the presence of nps and ufps in the hydrographic basin of the tubarão river and in the laguna estuary thus making it possible to relate the hazardous elements identified in the sediments collected in the field with the expansion of these suspended pollution particulates in nps through the use of sentinel 3b olci images when considering nuances found in this study such as contamination of the marine estuary by dangerous elements aggravated by floods combined with coal mining activities and captured by sediment analysis by field research and satellite images it is noted that this technique is suitable for the identification of terrestrial contaminants and is capable of being applied in future studies world wide credit authorship contribution statement alcindo neckel conceptualization funding acquisition marcos l s oliveira guilherme l

3018,spatially distributed watershed models are commonly utilized to address a wide range of water related issues however setting up a reliable watershed model is a difficult task involving several essential decisions making choice of calibration method is one of the most important decisions that has been sparsely investigated in semi distributed watershed models in this study therefore we used the soil and water assessment tool swat model to investigate the impact of three calibration methods sequential sqn simultaneous sml and sequential simultaneous sqn sml on model performance and parameter uncertainty in the kantamal catchment of the mahanadi basin india the findings across the calibration methods evaluated fit scores of streamflow for respective calibration and validation period showed that sqn sml calibration has the least amount of bias pbais 1 7 4 2 the highest nse 0 91 0 92 kge 0 95 0 94 and r2 0 91 0 92 furthermore sqn sml outperformed the other two methods in all three streamflow regimes low medium and high of flow duration curve analysis suspended sediment load ssl analyses of partitioned sediment duration curve showed the best performance of sqn sml for mid and low ssl regimes while all three calibration methods performed similarly in the high ssl regime sml calibration approach showed the least parameter uncertainty followed by sqn sml and sqn the p factor for sediment simulation was better for the sqn sml approach indicating the minimal model error for sediment simulation the sqn sml produced the least equifinal solution while the sqn approach produced the highest equifinal solution overall the findings of this study may help the watershed modelling communities for selecting suitable calibration strategies when dealing with integrated water resources management keywords multi variable calibration uncertainty simultaneous calibration extreme events simulation suspended sediment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction spatially distributed watershed models are extensively applied for addressing various water related issues at catchment scale perrin et al 2012 meaurio et al 2015 shrestha et al 2016a qiu et al 2019 xiong et al 2019 loiselle et al 2020 sinha et al 2020 daneshi et al 2021 hu et al 2021 these models are prevalent and practical tools for estimating hydro sedimentological fluxes and sources under current conditions and possible future scenarios however a watershed model s fidelity hinges on various factors kumar et al 2010 of which the quality of the model calibration is one of the critical factors molina navarro et al 2017 minimizing compensation error while enhancing simulation performance ahmadi et al 2014 is an important part of a good calibration technique that improves model reliability in solving practical issues gupta et al 1998 1999 parameters calibration is still one of the most critical issue in model applications hrachowitz et al 2014 yang et al 2019 various factors such as data availability data quality mathematical representation model complexity and objectives function among others make the task of watershed scale model calibration increasingly difficult most of the river basin of developing countries are poorly gauged most catchments even those with abundant data only have streamflow data available for the hydrological model calibration poor data quality and availability for calibration causes the parameter uncertainty to grow and results in inaccurate prediction to address the issue of data scarcity the use of soft data and remote sensing based data in calibration is suggested ilampooranan et al 2021 shah et al 2021 performance of calibration depend not only on the calibration variables but also on the input variables like meteorological data land use cover elevation data soil data management data therefore caution should be exercised while selecting these data due to the presence of dams and reservoirs natural processes are not dominant in intensively controlled watersheds modelling these watersheds will be challenging if comprehensive management information for dams and reservoirs is not accessible conceptual uncertainty occurs due to poor mathematical representation of watershed process in the model and complexity of model causes overparameterization due to large number of parameters representing different processes relative to available data another significant problem with calibrated models is conditionality calibrated parameters depend on a variety of factors including the objective function optimization technique type and number of data points as well as the calibration process any change in a factor will affect the calibrated parameters which could result in dramatically different predictions each objective function focuses on a different aspect of hydrology such as streamflow dynamics magnitude water balance components low flow high flow and so on because of the use of a specific objective function some parts of the hydrograph are inevitably weighted more heavily than others krause et al 2005 as a result depending on the focus of objective function different parts of the hydrograph are highlighted or ignored haas et al 2016 these problems limit the model utility and efficacy in management and decision making of natural resources to address the above problems various studies have been performed to investigate different aspect of calibration kirchner 2006 pfannerstill et al 2014 thirel et al 2015 haas et al 2016 triana et al 2019 ilampooranan et al 2021 an accurate simulation of streamflow at the watershed outlet can be produced by a hydrologic model calibrated using solely streamflow data but an unrealistic depiction of water balance across the landscape is likely to result from the same model recent research has shown that multi objective spatial calibration with remotely sensed evapotranspiration et soil moisture and gauged streamflow data can better constrain the model parameter and has the potential to spatially enhance the simulation of water balance components rajib et al 2018 shah et al 2021 a common calibration practice known as the split sample approach involves calibrating to older data and then testing models on newer data however this method produces calibrated parameters that are not robust since it only considers the data from the calibration period and sacrifice the data from the rest of the time series guo et al 2020 therefore it was suggested that calibrating to all available data and altogether skipping model validation was the most trustworthy split sample choice arsenault et al 2018 shen et al 2022 the use of a single performance criterion for model calibration tends to measure the difference between simulated and observed hydrographs by matching one aspect of the hydrograph at the expense of another haas et al 2016 furthermore the use of a single performance metric is insufficient to account for the representation of all relevant processes therefore the various stages of the hydrograph must be considered in multi metric frameworks with suitable performance measures for an efficient model evaluation pfannerstill et al 2014 it is necessary to replicate both low and high flows at the same time without ignoring the other hydrograph phases different performance measures must be considered during model calibration to accurately depict various hydrology and water quality situations haas et al 2016 most studies dealing with sediment or nutrient assessment used a multi step single variable optimization i e sequential calibration to calibrate streamflow and sediment nutrient variables santhi et al 2001 moriasi et al 2007 daggupati et al 2015 zeiger and hubbart 2016 the wide adoption of the sequential calibration approach among modelling communities is due to the assumption that streamflow affects the sediment generation process but sediment generation does not affect the streamflow zhang et al 2016 however given the uncertainty in observed streamflow yen et al 2014 errors in the calibrated streamflow simulation may also alter the subsequent sediment calibration process and directly affect sediment simulation santhi et al 2001 moriasi et al 2007 zhang et al 2013 in reality hydrological and soil erosion processes co occur and are inseparable and the optimization of streamflow and ssl objective function is directly in conflict for example overland flows decide both the streamflow and sediment generation the soil loss due to water erosion directly perturbs the soil nutrient balance reducing crop growth and plant transpiration in hydrological processes thereby indirectly affecting streamflow generation zhang et al 2016 wellen et al 2014 found that when the model calibrated with streamflow was updated with the sediment data the streamflow parameters showed a substantial change in value concluding that the optimal parameter space for streamflow simulation might not be optimal for sediment data they recommended more research on the comparison between the simultaneous and sequential calibration of streamflow and water quality variables brighenti et al 2019b compared the sequential and simultaneous calibration of streamflow and sediment in a small basin and concluded that simultaneous calibration was more accurate thus it may be rational and scientifically sound to adopt simultaneous calibration of all interacting variables in the integrated catchment models bergström et al 2002 wellen et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 although sequential calibration is the general approach for multi variable calibration the other two approaches simultaneous and sequential simultaneous calibration were infrequently used the simultaneous approach simultaneously calibrates all components of interest streamflow sediment nutrients in the integrated watershed models finally the third approach referred to as sequential simultaneous calibration is to calibrate the streamflow followed by a simultaneous calibration of streamflow and sediment shrestha et al 2016b however the literature lacks a comparative study of the abovementioned three calibration strategies to assess model performance and parameter uncertainty few studies have compared sequential and simultaneous multi variable calibration approaches and recommended confirming the superiority of simultaneous calibration by performing more studies bergström et al 2002 zhang et al 2016 brighenti et al 2019b also extreme events are becoming more frequent in recent time due to climate change and anthropogenic activities high flow events are significant contributors 70 80 of most basins annual ssl bezak et al 2014 chalov et al 2015 therefore it will be interesting to know which of the three approaches performed best regarding extreme low and high flow and sediment events simulations tan et al 2020 in light of the above literature gaps we aimed to see how and why three calibration methods namely sequential sqn simultaneous sml and sequential simultaneous sqn sml calibration could affect model performances in general and extreme event simulation in particular the objectives of this study are 1 to find the best performing calibration approach among three calibration approaches namely sqn sml and sqn sml by evaluating model performance when simulating streamflow and suspended sediment 2 to examine the model performances under three calibration approaches regarding extreme flow and sediment simulation regime 3 to assess the parameter uncertainty and equifinality under three calibration approaches the soil and water assessment tool swat model an established effective tool for analyzing the hydrological process at a watershed scale griensven et al 2012 gassman et al 2014 coupled with the sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm version 2 sufi 2 program was used to address the specific objectives outlined above 2 materials and methods 2 1 model overview distributed hydrological models are increasingly being used to guide stakeholders regarding appropriate adaptation strategies for land use change climate change water allocation and pollution control many such models have been developed in recent years including agnps agricultural none point source model young et al 1989 swat soil and water assessment tool arnold et al 1998 and hspf hydrologic simulation program fortran bicknell et al 2000 the swat is one of the prevalent basin wide spatially distributed continuous and semi process based hydrological programs developed to understand the implication of climate change and land management activities on hydro sedimentological fluxes brighenti et al 2019a it was developed by the united states department of agriculture agricultural research service and the texas a m university by combining the simulator for water resources in rural basins swrrb model williams et al 1985 and the routing outputs to the outlet roto model arnold et al 1995 in the early 1990s arnold et al 2012 since the first publicly released version in 1994 swat has seen nearly substantial upgrades arnold et al 1998 gassman et al 2007 a complete description of swat may be found in the swat theoretical documentation neitsch et al 2011 while creating a watershed model swat represents the basin heterogeneity with two phases of discretization the spatial discretization of basin into sub basins and sub basins are discretised into hydrological response units hrus these units comprise the same land use slope range and soil class and are basic simulation unit of the model the model offers two methods for surface runoff simulation the scs curve number and the green ampt infiltration method we used the scs curve number method due to the lack of sub daily rainfall data for the study area the peak streamflow indicates a storm s erosive power and is the primary controlling variable for sediment loss the model uses a modified rational method to simulate the peak streamflow rate chow et al 1988 the hargreaves and samani 1985 method and variable storage routing approach were selected for evapotranspiration et estimation and streamflow routing calculation respectively soil erosion at the hru scale is estimated with modified universal soil loss equation musle and channel transport is modelled by bagnold s equation neitsch et al 2011 the musle equation is 1 s 11 8 q sruf q area a r e a hru 0 56 k l s c p c f r g where s is the total sediment generated tons qsruf is the

factor and coarse fraction radius 1 mm factor respectively as used in the universal soil loss equation usle 2 2 study area and data used the kantamal catchment of the mahanadi river basin situated in odisha india was chosen as the testbed to perform this study fig 1 the catchment lies between 19 16 10 n and 20 44 42 n latitudes 82 02 50 e and 84 30 00 e longitudes covering an approximate area of 20 235 km2 the catchment is drained by the tel river which is a major tributary of the mahanadi river basin it joins the right bank of the mahanadi river downstream of the hirakud reservoir land use is dominated by agricultural land which occupies about 55 64 of the catchment area while forest second major land use covers about 35 of the area croplands are mainly associated with clay loam while forests with sandy clay loam soil clay loam is the primary soil class 51 31 of the catchment mean annual rainfall maximum temperature and minimum temperature of the catchment are 1300 mm 39 c and 20 c respectively rainfall occurs mainly during the monsoon months june to september accounting for about 85 90 of the total rainfall as the swat model is data intensive the various spatial data viz digital elevation model dem land use soil and temporal data meteorological data are required to simulate hydro sedimentological watershed processes the dem 90 m spatial resolution was retrieved from the shuttle radar topography mission website http earthexplorer usgs gov the soil data of 1 km 1 km spatial scale was procured from the food and agriculture organization fao united nations soil database land use land cover lulc data for the year 2005 at a 100 m 100 m spatial scale was obtained from the oak ridge national laboratory distributed active archive center ornl daac the national aeronautics and space administration nasa earth observing system data and information system eosdis data centers roy et al 2015 das et al 2018 in this study the gridded rainfall 0 25 0 25 pai et al 2014 and temperature 1 1 data were collected from the india meteorological department imd pune the 1 1 temperature observation is re gridded to 0 25 0 25 by using bilinear interpolation method to maintain the consistent spatial resolution of the observed datasets peng et al 2019 swain et al 2020 streamflow and suspended sediment concentration data at daily scale observed at kantamal gauging station for 2000 to 2014 period were procured from the central water commission cwc bhubaneswar 2 3 model calibration and validation the swat model for kantamal catchment was calibrated and validated at a monthly scale for streamflow and suspended sediment load ssl both processes preceded by three years of spin up period to remove model bias due to the initial state were established using the split sample method partitioning the whole period 2003 2014 into two time spans 2003 2011 calibration and 2012 2014 validation 2 3 1 sufi 2 procedure sensitivity analysis calibration and validation were conducted in the swat cup program a total of 22 parameters were selected for calibration of the swat model based on the sensitivity analysis for each calibration method table 1 sufi 2 an inverse modelling procedure for joint optimization and uncertainty analysis was used for calibration and validation in the swat cup program abbaspour et al 2004 it was chosen for swat model calibration because it is the least computationally challenging of the available optimization programs in swat cup yang et al 2008 wu and chen 2015 the parameters were uniformly pooled for each iteration using latin hypercube sampling based on the number of runs at each iteration the parameter spaces get smaller always concentrated on the parameter set that provided the highest objective function value abbaspour et al 2015 2 3 2 objective function and model performance evaluation despite its bias toward extreme observations the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse has been the popular choice as an objective function in model calibration molina navarro et al 2017 it is a normalized statistic that expresses the ratio of the magnitude of residual variance to measured data variance the nse values vary from to 1 with 1 denoting a flawless simulation zero denoting neutral performance and below zero denoting poor model performance according to moriasi et al 2007 nse values 0 5 for monthly flow sediments and nutrients were considered acceptable model performance the objective function is given below as 2 n s e 1 i 1 n x obs i x sim i 2 i 1 n x obs i x obs 2 where x streamflow ssl x s i m i simulated variable at ith month x o b s i observed variable at ith month x o b s mean observed variable n number of observations under consideration it may result in the deceptive evaluation of the model performance when a single indicator is used instead a set of performance measures like graphical plots relative value error metrics and normalized error metrics are suggested moriasi et al 2015 therefore multiple error metrics namely coefficient of determination r2 nse percentage bias pbias kling gupta efficiency kge and time series plots were used to examine the model performances the nse was used as an objective function while the other metrics were used to assess the adequacy of the calibrated model three iterations were used for each of the three calibration strategies with 500 runs per iteration validation was done with a single simulation that included the best parameters from each calibration method r2 indicates the amount of variance of observations explained by the model where 1 represents the optimum value the pbias examines the trend between the average of the simulated values and the observed ones the zero value of pbias represents a perfect match between observations and model simulation 25 for streamflow and 55 for ssl indicates the good performance ratings as per moriasi et al 2007 model underestimation and overestimation are indicated by the positive and negative value of pbias by breaking the nse index down into its individual components kge is an upgraded version of the nse index in contrast to nse multi component structure of kge includes linear correlation bias and variability inside a single objective function resulting in a more balanced model evaluation when kge 0 41 it indicates that it is better to use the observed mean as a predictor knoben et al 2019 if a performance is over 0 75 or 0 5 on the kge scale it is regarded as good or intermediate performance respectively brighenti et al 2019b the perfect value of the kge is one 3 r 2 i 1 n x obs i x obs x sim i x sim i 1 n x obs i x obs 2 2 i 1 n x sim i x sim 2 2 2 4 p b i a s i 1 n x obs i x sim i i 1 n x obs i 100 5 kge 1 γ 1 2 α 1 2 β 1 2 where γ is the correlation coefficient between simulated and observed data α is ratio of the mean of simulated and observed data β is the ratio of the standard deviation of simulated and observed data two criteria have been widely applied to examine the goodness of predictive uncertainty a the fraction of observation captured inside the 95 prediction uncertainty 95ppu envelope p factor and b the ratio of the average width of the 95ppu envelope to the standard deviation of the corresponding measured variable r factor p factor of 1 and r factor of zero represent a perfect model but this may never be realistic due to the wide range of uncertainty present in the modelling chain p factor 0 70 and r factor 1 50 according to abbaspour et al 2015 are considered good model performances 2 4 overview of calibration methods and procedure of their comparative assessment three calibration methods sequential sqn simultaneous sml and sequential simultaneous sqn sml were selected for streamflow and ssl modelling parameters related to streamflow and sediment generation are adjusted simultaneously in an sml calibration method wellen et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 the sqn approach first calibrates the streamflow and then the ssl santhi et al 2001 daggupati et al 2015 brighenti et al 2019b while this approach considers the causal linkages between streamflow and ssl it locks the streamflow parameter range when proceeding to the ssl calibration the sqn sml approach starts the calibration with streamflow parameters in the first iteration and with next iteration a simultaneous calibration of streamflow and sediment is done using the initial parameter ranges for sediment and obtained updated sub optimal streamflow parameter range from the first iteration shrestha et al 2016b as mentioned in section 2 3 2 all calibration methods were performed with three iterations to compare the three strategies objectively however only one iteration is performed with streamflow in sequential calibration strategy because we got the optimal parameter range for streamflow in the first iteration as indicated by nse and the number of behavioural solutions the second and third iteration in the sqn calibration strategy corresponds to two iterations with sediment parameter and fixed optimal range streamflow parameters obtained from the first iteration simultaneous calibration strategy consists of three iterations each having both streamflow as well as sediment parameters performance evaluation and parameter uncertainty assessment of model calibrated with three calibration methods was done with an aim to find the best calibration method comparison of three calibration methods was done based on following criteria a conventional method of model performance evaluation using four goodness of fit statistics nse pbias r2 and kge b model performance evaluation for low mid and high streamflow and ssl regimes using the streamflow and sediment duration curve comparison c model performance evaluation for the specific variables like peak discharge ssl hydrograph sedimentograph volume low mid and high streamflow ssl d predictive uncertainty evaluation using p and r factors and model equifinality assessment using the number of behavioral solutions e parameter uncertainty assessment using final calibrated parameter range and using the normalized uncertainty score see equation 6 detail of these criteria was discussed in the appropriate sections of the paper 2 5 model performances evaluation under extreme hydrological regimes the flow duration curve fdc is a valuable tool for comparing the performance of a hydrologic model to the actual watershed system behaviours yilmaz et al 2008 proposed categorizing fdc into three categories high low and mid range which constitute essential hydrological signatures therefore duration curves of streamflow and ssl were partitioned into three parts as per exceedance probability to emphasize model simulation accuracy in extreme regimes pfannerstill et al 2014 haas et al 2016 duration curves with 0 20 20 80 and 80 100 exceedance probability range under three calibration methods were considered separately to examine the model adequacy for high mid and low regimes simulation respectively also simulation accuracy of the variables like peak discharge and associated hydrograph volume peak ssl and associated sedimentograph volume low mid and high streamflow and ssl were assessed using the nse and nrmse indices under three calibration approaches for the combined calibration and validation period peak discharge and peak ssl were extracted annually from respective timeseries data for the whole period hydrograph sedimentograph were separated from timeseries by visually identifying beginning and end of respective hydrograph sedimentograph corresponding to the annual peak discharge ssl 2 6 parameter uncertainty and model equifinality model equifinality and parameter uncertainty are closely interlinked these were assessed following the methodology of rajib et al 2016 higher model equifinality leads to greater parameter uncertainty several parameter sets may exist within the final optimized range producing behavioural solutions having equally satisfactory performances beven and binley 1992 beven 2006 all parameter values within their final calibrated range and having an objective function greater than a predetermined threshold nse 0 5 are considered behavioral parameters in this study to reduce the parameter uncertainty to 0 1 scale for easy and fair comparison all the behavioral parameters were converted to this scale following the normalization eq 6 6 r n r b l l u l l l where r n is the normalized uncertainty score r b is the behavioral parameter value from the final iteration u l and l l belong to initial parameter space in the first iteration 3 results and discussion the result of relative performances of swat simulation under sqn sml and sqn sml calibration methods are presented and discussed in this section simulated streamflow and ssl under the three model calibration strategies were compared with the measured counterparts with the corresponding decrease in the parameter uncertainty range the possible decrease in equifinality is measured performance measures such as goodness of fit statistics duration curves and hydrographs comparison observed vs simulated parametric uncertainty and predictive uncertainty for the monthly flow and suspended sediment simulations have been investigated to show the difference between the three calibration methods duration curves for extremes regime high flow ssl and low flow ssl were also analyzed to examine the suitability of three calibration approaches for simulation of extreme events also the variables like low mid and high streamflow and ssl hydrograph and sedimentograph characteristics peak flow ssl and corresponding volume were evaluated for three calibration strategies with nse and nrmse nrmse rmse standard deviation of observed variable indices to strengthen the comparative analysis the findings are discussed below 3 1 model performance evaluation under three calibration methods table 2 illustrates the error metrics of the three calibration strategies after an equal number of model simulations for calibration and validation periods r2 nse pbias and kge for streamflow ranged from 0 85 to 0 91 0 86 0 92 0 78 0 91 0 73 0 92 1 7 16 4 4 2 16 5 and 0 65 0 95 0 57 0 94 respectively during calibration validation period sqn sml calibration exhibited the lowest amount of bias pbais 1 7 4 2 highest nse 0 91 0 92 kge 0 95 0 94 and r2 0 91 0 92 when the fit scores were compared for streamflow across calibration schemes during calibration and validation period table 2 comparison of monthly simulated streamflow hydrographs under three calibration approaches with observed streamflow hydrograph fig 2 a showed overall good similarities and satisfactory model performance for each calibration strategy in both calibration and validation period however fig 2a showed that the sqn calibration approach overestimated the low flow and underestimated the peak flow most of the time suggesting that the sqn calibration scheme may be the least performing strategy out of three strategies table 4 the model components are calibrated sequentially using the sequential method this method can lock the model into a parameter setting that is adequate for one variable but prevents proper simulation of other variables this is especially true for sediment modelling where a minor compromise in streamflow simulation can result in dramatically improved sediment simulations bergström et al 2002 in contrast the sqn sml calibration approach performed well in extreme flow regime both low and high streamflow simulation as nse and nrmse value for both high and low streamflow for sqn sml were much better than sqn method suggesting that the sqn sml calibration scheme may be used to simulate extreme flow events table 4 sqn sml approach has the advantage of both sqn and sml approaches as it uses the acceptable but sub optimal streamflow parameters from the first phase to do the simultaneous calibration of both sediment and streamflow in the final phase of calibration thus it does not lock the sub optimal streamflow parameter which is the major deficiency of the sqn calibration process and does not start the simultaneous calibration from the initial streamflow parameter range which may be a major deficiency of the sml approach the sml approach was also advocated by wellen et al 2014 our results are also consistent with previous studies that have shown that the sqn sml approach is better than the sqn approach bergström et al 2002 zhang et al 2016 brighenti et al 2019b r2 varied from 0 61 to 0 65 0 54 0 61 nse varied from 0 6 to 0 64 0 52 0 55 pbias varied from 8 1 to 4 17 9 29 8 and kge varied from 0 63 to 0 65 0 47 0 53 for suspended sediment simulation during calibration validation suggesting near equal performances of all three calibration strategies for suspended sediment simulation all three approaches performed equally good for ssl simulation fig 2b as the comparison didn t reveal significant differences among suspended sediment simulation by three calibration approaches the sqn calibration technique delivered the best sediment simulation result but it performed the poorest of all three calibration schemes for streamflow simulation while comparing the goodness of fit result though the sqn approach has the advantage of accommodating the causal linkages of the streamflow and sediment generation process it does not permit any modification of the streamflow parameter ranges while doing the sediment calibration this procedure is adopted even though semi distributed catchment scale models are over parameterized therefore choosing a single parameter set of streamflow for subsequent sediment calibrations may be sub optimal wellen et al 2014 overall it is evident that all three calibration approaches provided satisfactory simulation results for streamflow and suspended sediment as per moriasi et al 2007 also the goodness of fit scores of streamflow were better than suspended sediment load for all calibration strategies this may be due to higher structural and data uncertainty in the sediment modelling than the streamflow modelling except for year 2004 2005 2007 2009 and 2012 sqn technique fared worse than sqn sml for simulating peak discharge fig s1 and sqn sml method outperformed sqn method for simulating hydrograph volume for the entire period except 2005 2009 and 2012 fig s2 sqn sml technique outperformed sml method for peak discharge simulation for all years except 2003 2004 2005 2007 2009 and 2012 fig s1 and sqn sml method outperformed sml method for hydrograph volume simulation for all years except 2003 2005 2009 and 2012 fig s2 also we investigated model performance using nse and nrmse indices for peak discharge and associated hydrograph volume peak ssl and associated sedimentograph volume individually to provide a more quantitative understanding of the performance of three calibration procedures table 3 for the sqn sml sml and sqn approaches the nse nrmse values for peak discharge were 0 6 61 5 0 51 67 2 and 0 05 98 and for hydrograph volume 0 84 38 8 0 71 52 and 0 34 77 7 respectively this demonstrates that the sqn sml method outperformed the sqn as well as sml method in terms of peak discharge and hydrograph volume simulation although the sml calibration approach outperformed sqn calibration approaches it did not improve model performance over the sqn sml method for streamflow table 2 peak discharge and hydrograph volume simulation table 3 peak ssl nse nrmse values for the sqn sml sml and sqn approaches were 0 08 91 8 0 1 91 and 0 14 89 respectively and sedimentograph volume nse nrmse values were 0 11 90 2 0 13 89 5 and 0 15 88 1 also figs s3 and s4 did not show any major improvement of one method over the others for peak ssl and sedimentograph volume simulation respectively this demonstrates that the all three methods performed similarly in terms of peak ssl and sedimentograph volume simulation 3 2 model performance assessments under extreme flow and ssl regimes as the frequency analysis of streamflow and ssl is crucial for extreme hazard assessment and management capability of three calibration approaches in reproducing the observed flow and sediment duration curve in three portions were evaluated as depicted in figs 3 and 4 the duration curve of streamflow and ssl were segmented into three parts based on exceedance probability monthly streamflow was ranked in descending order to plot the flow duration curve then monthly ranked streamflow qi were plotted as a function of their corresponding exceedance probability pi i n 1 where i is the rank and n is the total number of months under consideration comparison of simulated duration curve with observed counterpart in 0 20 20 80 and 80 100 exceedance probability regions represent performance of calibration strategies in high mid and low regime of hydro sedimentological variables flow duration curve under all three namely high mid and low flow regime indicates sqn sml calibration s superiority over sqn calibration in both calibration and validation period as shown in fig 3 the investigation of the duration curve for ssl shows that both sqn sml and sml calibration schemes performed better than sqn calibration for simulation of low and mid suspended sediment regimes fig 4 however all three approaches have performed similarly in high sediment simulation in both calibration and validation periods fig 4 a d also we investigated model performance using nse and nrmse for low mid and high streamflow ssl individually to provide a more quantitative understanding of the performance of three calibration procedures table 4 we found that nse nrmse values for high mid and low streamflow were 0 66 57 0 71 53 5 and 1 88 166 7 for sqn sml approach 0 55 65 8 0 52 68 6 and 1 48 154 6 for sml approach and 0 14 91 3 0 67 57 2 and 50 34 703 6 for sqn method respectively this again shows that sqn sml method outperformed the sqn method in the simulation of all three streamflow regimes we also discovered that nse nrmse values for high mid and low ssl were 0 3 81 5 2 173 9 and 160 1244 4 for sqn sml approach 0 307 81 7 3 6 214 2 and 163 1255 7 for sml approach and 0 35 79 4 1 25 149 4 and 98 9733 for sqn method respectively implying that sqn performed better than sqn sml for high and mid ssl but sqn sml performed better than sqn for low ssl due to the much lower nrmse value for sqn sml method than that for sqn method overall the sqn calibration technique delivered the comparatively better sediment simulation result but it performed the poorest of all three calibration schemes for streamflow simulation 3 3 predictive uncertainty and model equifinality the r factor varied from 0 41 to 0 6 for suspended sediment simulation during calibration suggesting near equal performances of all three calibration strategies at the same time p factor was estimated to be 0 46 0 71 and 0 97 respectively for sml sqn and sqn sml calibration in case of sediment simulation thus sqn sml strategy produced the highest p factor for sediment simulation indicating minimal model error for sediment when nse was equal to or 0 50 simulations were considered behavioural in this study the higher the number of behavioural solutions the higher is model equifinality nemri and kinnard 2020 the number of behavioural solutions was 500 for streamflow and 94 for sediment in the sqn calibration method in contrast sml calibration gave 420 behavioural solutions out of 500 for both streamflow and suspended sediment whereas sqn sml calibration gave 229 out of 500 for both streamflow and suspended sediment thus sqn sml produced the least equifinal solution while the sqn produced the highest equifinal solution the nse 0 5 threshold was set arbitrarily but when we conducted the sensitivity of threshold on the number of behavioral solutions we still found that sqn sml gave lesser number of behavioural solutions for streamflow than sqn calibration method table 5 3 4 parameter uncertainty assessment under three calibration methods table 6 shows the optimized parameter value and final optimized parameter range computed as the difference between the upper and lower limits for the three calibration strategies except for five parameters related to sediment simulation usle k cov1 cov2 prf bsn spcon all parameters showed a decrease in uncertainty in sqn sml calibration compared to sqn as shown in table 6 the output of sml calibration is the more interesting because it shows a significant reduction in uncertainty for all the parameters involved table 6 however the calibrated parameter space and optimum parameter set producing the best objective function value may not always represent the catchment condition while still providing acceptable results rajib and merwade 2016 the behavioural range of parameters can be used to assess the reduction in equifinality and associated degree of uncertainty as a result the lower the degree of equifinality the narrower the behavioural range vrugt and beven 2018 this section calculates the uncertainty in parameters under three calibration approaches by applying eq 6 transforming each behavioral parameter value into a normalized uncertainty score fig 5 presents the normalised uncertainty score of the ten most sensitive parameters under three calibration methods the p values of global sensitvity analysis were used to identify most sensitive parameters table 7 a small change in parameter value with a lower p value results in a larger change in simulation output it is evident from fig 5 that sqn have the highest uncertainty score spread as reflected by the interquartile range for all the parameters except spcon and prf bsn which indicates the higher equifinality problem of the sqn method the calibration using the sqn sml and sml strategy reduced the number of equifinal streamflow parameters sets and their dispersion fig 5 the range i e the difference between the upper and lower limit of the parameter value and interquartile range of the parameters for streamflow was significantly reduced when using the sqn sml and sml method compared to the sqn method fig 5 thus the sml and sqn sml method resulted in a reduced number of equifinal streamflow parameter sets than the sqn method this demonstrates the striking impact of the simultaneous approach on reducing parameter uncertainty consistent with the finding of brighenti et al 2019b 4 summary and conclusions this study investigated three operational calibration procedures namely sqn sml and sqn sml to model streamflow and suspended sediment using the swat model the performance of calibration approaches is examined in terms of simulation accuracy of streamflow and ssl at the basin outlet during the calibration and validation period flow and sediment duration curves were segmented into high mid and low regions as per probability of exceedance to assess the calibration performance under three regimes finally parameter uncertainty and model equifinality were assessed using the analysis of behavioural solutions when comparing the goodness of fit scores for streamflow across calibration schemes for the calibration and validation period sqn sml calibration had the least level of bias pbais 1 7 4 2 the highest nse 0 91 0 92 kge 0 95 0 94 and r2 0 95 0 94 according to segmented flow duration curve analysis sqn sml performed the best among the three techniques under all three flow regimes but as per segmented sediment duration curve analysis sqn sml outperformed sqn only in the mid and low ssl regimes whereas all three calibration approaches performed comparably in the high ssl regime the sml technique produced the minimal parameter uncertainty followed by sqn sml and sqn also the sqn sml method yielded the highest p factor for sediment simulation suggesting the least model error for sediment sqn sml generated the least equifinal solution whereas sqn produced the most equifinal solution while the findings of this research are encouraging the proposed solution must be supported by further studies using different hydrological models and hydro climatic environments we believe that using all available calibration variables streamflow et soil moisture sediment simultaneously could produce substantial improvement in calibration performances and physical realism of model thereby reducing the risk of compensatory and overparameterization issue due to insufficiently constrained model rajib et al 2018 dembélé et al 2020 franco et al 2020 the improved predictive skills and reduced parameter equifinality will significantly contribute to studies relating to long term impacts of climate and land use change hydro climatic extreme event predictions sediment prediction and management and nutrient prediction overall the study s findings are expected to support the decision making of calibration choices and its implication

3018,spatially distributed watershed models are commonly utilized to address a wide range of water related issues however setting up a reliable watershed model is a difficult task involving several essential decisions making choice of calibration method is one of the most important decisions that has been sparsely investigated in semi distributed watershed models in this study therefore we used the soil and water assessment tool swat model to investigate the impact of three calibration methods sequential sqn simultaneous sml and sequential simultaneous sqn sml on model performance and parameter uncertainty in the kantamal catchment of the mahanadi basin india the findings across the calibration methods evaluated fit scores of streamflow for respective calibration and validation period showed that sqn sml calibration has the least amount of bias pbais 1 7 4 2 the highest nse 0 91 0 92 kge 0 95 0 94 and r2 0 91 0 92 furthermore sqn sml outperformed the other two methods in all three streamflow regimes low medium and high of flow duration curve analysis suspended sediment load ssl analyses of partitioned sediment duration curve showed the best performance of sqn sml for mid and low ssl regimes while all three calibration methods performed similarly in the high ssl regime sml calibration approach showed the least parameter uncertainty followed by sqn sml and sqn the p factor for sediment simulation was better for the sqn sml approach indicating the minimal model error for sediment simulation the sqn sml produced the least equifinal solution while the sqn approach produced the highest equifinal solution overall the findings of this study may help the watershed modelling communities for selecting suitable calibration strategies when dealing with integrated water resources management keywords multi variable calibration uncertainty simultaneous calibration extreme events simulation suspended sediment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction spatially distributed watershed models are extensively applied for addressing various water related issues at catchment scale perrin et al 2012 meaurio et al 2015 shrestha et al 2016a qiu et al 2019 xiong et al 2019 loiselle et al 2020 sinha et al 2020 daneshi et al 2021 hu et al 2021 these models are prevalent and practical tools for estimating hydro sedimentological fluxes and sources under current conditions and possible future scenarios however a watershed model s fidelity hinges on various factors kumar et al 2010 of which the quality of the model calibration is one of the critical factors molina navarro et al 2017 minimizing compensation error while enhancing simulation performance ahmadi et al 2014 is an important part of a good calibration technique that improves model reliability in solving practical issues gupta et al 1998 1999 parameters calibration is still one of the most critical issue in model applications hrachowitz et al 2014 yang et al 2019 various factors such as data availability data quality mathematical representation model complexity and objectives function among others make the task of watershed scale model calibration increasingly difficult most of the river basin of developing countries are poorly gauged most catchments even those with abundant data only have streamflow data available for the hydrological model calibration poor data quality and availability for calibration causes the parameter uncertainty to grow and results in inaccurate prediction to address the issue of data scarcity the use of soft data and remote sensing based data in calibration is suggested ilampooranan et al 2021 shah et al 2021 performance of calibration depend not only on the calibration variables but also on the input variables like meteorological data land use cover elevation data soil data management data therefore caution should be exercised while selecting these data due to the presence of dams and reservoirs natural processes are not dominant in intensively controlled watersheds modelling these watersheds will be challenging if comprehensive management information for dams and reservoirs is not accessible conceptual uncertainty occurs due to poor mathematical representation of watershed process in the model and complexity of model causes overparameterization due to large number of parameters representing different processes relative to available data another significant problem with calibrated models is conditionality calibrated parameters depend on a variety of factors including the objective function optimization technique type and number of data points as well as the calibration process any change in a factor will affect the calibrated parameters which could result in dramatically different predictions each objective function focuses on a different aspect of hydrology such as streamflow dynamics magnitude water balance components low flow high flow and so on because of the use of a specific objective function some parts of the hydrograph are inevitably weighted more heavily than others krause et al 2005 as a result depending on the focus of objective function different parts of the hydrograph are highlighted or ignored haas et al 2016 these problems limit the model utility and efficacy in management and decision making of natural resources to address the above problems various studies have been performed to investigate different aspect of calibration kirchner 2006 pfannerstill et al 2014 thirel et al 2015 haas et al 2016 triana et al 2019 ilampooranan et al 2021 an accurate simulation of streamflow at the watershed outlet can be produced by a hydrologic model calibrated using solely streamflow data but an unrealistic depiction of water balance across the landscape is likely to result from the same model recent research has shown that multi objective spatial calibration with remotely sensed evapotranspiration et soil moisture and gauged streamflow data can better constrain the model parameter and has the potential to spatially enhance the simulation of water balance components rajib et al 2018 shah et al 2021 a common calibration practice known as the split sample approach involves calibrating to older data and then testing models on newer data however this method produces calibrated parameters that are not robust since it only considers the data from the calibration period and sacrifice the data from the rest of the time series guo et al 2020 therefore it was suggested that calibrating to all available data and altogether skipping model validation was the most trustworthy split sample choice arsenault et al 2018 shen et al 2022 the use of a single performance criterion for model calibration tends to measure the difference between simulated and observed hydrographs by matching one aspect of the hydrograph at the expense of another haas et al 2016 furthermore the use of a single performance metric is insufficient to account for the representation of all relevant processes therefore the various stages of the hydrograph must be considered in multi metric frameworks with suitable performance measures for an efficient model evaluation pfannerstill et al 2014 it is necessary to replicate both low and high flows at the same time without ignoring the other hydrograph phases different performance measures must be considered during model calibration to accurately depict various hydrology and water quality situations haas et al 2016 most studies dealing with sediment or nutrient assessment used a multi step single variable optimization i e sequential calibration to calibrate streamflow and sediment nutrient variables santhi et al 2001 moriasi et al 2007 daggupati et al 2015 zeiger and hubbart 2016 the wide adoption of the sequential calibration approach among modelling communities is due to the assumption that streamflow affects the sediment generation process but sediment generation does not affect the streamflow zhang et al 2016 however given the uncertainty in observed streamflow yen et al 2014 errors in the calibrated streamflow simulation may also alter the subsequent sediment calibration process and directly affect sediment simulation santhi et al 2001 moriasi et al 2007 zhang et al 2013 in reality hydrological and soil erosion processes co occur and are inseparable and the optimization of streamflow and ssl objective function is directly in conflict for example overland flows decide both the streamflow and sediment generation the soil loss due to water erosion directly perturbs the soil nutrient balance reducing crop growth and plant transpiration in hydrological processes thereby indirectly affecting streamflow generation zhang et al 2016 wellen et al 2014 found that when the model calibrated with streamflow was updated with the sediment data the streamflow parameters showed a substantial change in value concluding that the optimal parameter space for streamflow simulation might not be optimal for sediment data they recommended more research on the comparison between the simultaneous and sequential calibration of streamflow and water quality variables brighenti et al 2019b compared the sequential and simultaneous calibration of streamflow and sediment in a small basin and concluded that simultaneous calibration was more accurate thus it may be rational and scientifically sound to adopt simultaneous calibration of all interacting variables in the integrated catchment models bergström et al 2002 wellen et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 although sequential calibration is the general approach for multi variable calibration the other two approaches simultaneous and sequential simultaneous calibration were infrequently used the simultaneous approach simultaneously calibrates all components of interest streamflow sediment nutrients in the integrated watershed models finally the third approach referred to as sequential simultaneous calibration is to calibrate the streamflow followed by a simultaneous calibration of streamflow and sediment shrestha et al 2016b however the literature lacks a comparative study of the abovementioned three calibration strategies to assess model performance and parameter uncertainty few studies have compared sequential and simultaneous multi variable calibration approaches and recommended confirming the superiority of simultaneous calibration by performing more studies bergström et al 2002 zhang et al 2016 brighenti et al 2019b also extreme events are becoming more frequent in recent time due to climate change and anthropogenic activities high flow events are significant contributors 70 80 of most basins annual ssl bezak et al 2014 chalov et al 2015 therefore it will be interesting to know which of the three approaches performed best regarding extreme low and high flow and sediment events simulations tan et al 2020 in light of the above literature gaps we aimed to see how and why three calibration methods namely sequential sqn simultaneous sml and sequential simultaneous sqn sml calibration could affect model performances in general and extreme event simulation in particular the objectives of this study are 1 to find the best performing calibration approach among three calibration approaches namely sqn sml and sqn sml by evaluating model performance when simulating streamflow and suspended sediment 2 to examine the model performances under three calibration approaches regarding extreme flow and sediment simulation regime 3 to assess the parameter uncertainty and equifinality under three calibration approaches the soil and water assessment tool swat model an established effective tool for analyzing the hydrological process at a watershed scale griensven et al 2012 gassman et al 2014 coupled with the sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm version 2 sufi 2 program was used to address the specific objectives outlined above 2 materials and methods 2 1 model overview distributed hydrological models are increasingly being used to guide stakeholders regarding appropriate adaptation strategies for land use change climate change water allocation and pollution control many such models have been developed in recent years including agnps agricultural none point source model young et al 1989 swat soil and water assessment tool arnold et al 1998 and hspf hydrologic simulation program fortran bicknell et al 2000 the swat is one of the prevalent basin wide spatially distributed continuous and semi process based hydrological programs developed to understand the implication of climate change and land management activities on hydro sedimentological fluxes brighenti et al 2019a it was developed by the united states department of agriculture agricultural research service and the texas a m university by combining the simulator for water resources in rural basins swrrb model williams et al 1985 and the routing outputs to the outlet roto model arnold et al 1995 in the early 1990s arnold et al 2012 since the first publicly released version in 1994 swat has seen nearly substantial upgrades arnold et al 1998 gassman et al 2007 a complete description of swat may be found in the swat theoretical documentation neitsch et al 2011 while creating a watershed model swat represents the basin heterogeneity with two phases of discretization the spatial discretization of basin into sub basins and sub basins are discretised into hydrological response units hrus these units comprise the same land use slope range and soil class and are basic simulation unit of the model the model offers two methods for surface runoff simulation the scs curve number and the green ampt infiltration method we used the scs curve number method due to the lack of sub daily rainfall data for the study area the peak streamflow indicates a storm s erosive power and is the primary controlling variable for sediment loss the model uses a modified rational method to simulate the peak streamflow rate chow et al 1988 the hargreaves and samani 1985 method and variable storage routing approach were selected for evapotranspiration et estimation and streamflow routing calculation respectively soil erosion at the hru scale is estimated with modified universal soil loss equation musle and channel transport is modelled by bagnold s equation neitsch et al 2011 the musle equation is 1 s 11 8 q sruf q area a r e a hru 0 56 k l s c p c f r g where s is the total sediment generated tons qsruf is the surface runoff mm ha qpeak is the peak streamflow rate m3 s areahru is the area of hru ha k ls c p and cfrg are the soil erodibility factor slope length factor land cover factor support practice factor and coarse fraction radius 1 mm factor respectively as used in the universal soil loss equation usle 2 2 study area and data used the kantamal catchment of the mahanadi river basin situated in odisha india was chosen as the testbed to perform this study fig 1 the catchment lies between 19 16 10 n and 20 44 42 n latitudes 82 02 50 e and 84 30 00 e longitudes covering an approximate area of 20 235 km2 the catchment is drained by the tel river which is a major tributary of the mahanadi river basin it joins the right bank of the mahanadi river downstream of the hirakud reservoir land use is dominated by agricultural land which occupies about 55 64 of the catchment area while forest second major land use covers about 35 of the area croplands are mainly associated with clay loam while forests with sandy clay loam soil clay loam is the primary soil class 51 31 of the catchment mean annual rainfall maximum temperature and minimum temperature of the catchment are 1300 mm 39 c and 20 c respectively rainfall occurs mainly during the monsoon months june to september accounting for about 85 90 of the total rainfall as the swat model is data intensive the various spatial data viz digital elevation model dem land use soil and temporal data meteorological data are required to simulate hydro sedimentological watershed processes the dem 90 m spatial resolution was retrieved from the shuttle radar topography mission website http earthexplorer usgs gov the soil data of 1 km 1 km spatial scale was procured from the food and agriculture organization fao united nations soil database land use land cover lulc data for the year 2005 at a 100 m 100 m spatial scale was obtained from the oak ridge national laboratory distributed active archive center ornl daac the national aeronautics and space administration nasa earth observing system data and information system eosdis data centers roy et al 2015 das et al 2018 in this study the gridded rainfall 0 25 0 25 pai et al 2014 and temperature 1 1 data were collected from the india meteorological department imd pune the 1 1 temperature observation is re gridded to 0 25 0 25 by using bilinear interpolation method to maintain the consistent spatial resolution of the observed datasets peng et al 2019 swain et al 2020 streamflow and suspended sediment concentration data at daily scale observed at kantamal gauging station for 2000 to 2014 period were procured from the central water commission cwc bhubaneswar 2 3 model calibration and validation the swat model for kantamal catchment was calibrated and validated at a monthly scale for streamflow and suspended sediment load ssl both processes preceded by three years of spin up period to remove model bias due to the initial state were established using the split sample method partitioning the whole period 2003 2014 into two time spans 2003 2011 calibration and 2012 2014 validation 2 3 1 sufi 2 procedure sensitivity analysis calibration and validation were conducted in the swat cup program a total of 22 parameters were selected for calibration of the swat model based on the sensitivity analysis for each calibration method table 1 sufi 2 an inverse modelling procedure for joint optimization and uncertainty analysis was used for calibration and validation in the swat cup program abbaspour et al 2004 it was chosen for swat model calibration because it is the least computationally challenging of the available optimization programs in swat cup yang et al 2008 wu and chen 2015 the parameters were uniformly pooled for each iteration using latin hypercube sampling based on the number of runs at each iteration the parameter spaces get smaller always concentrated on the parameter set that provided the highest objective function value abbaspour et al 2015 2 3 2 objective function and model performance evaluation despite its bias toward extreme observations the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse has been the popular choice as an objective function in model calibration molina navarro et al 2017 it is a normalized statistic that expresses the ratio of the magnitude of residual variance to measured data variance the nse values vary from to 1 with 1 denoting a flawless simulation zero denoting neutral performance and below zero denoting poor model performance according to moriasi et al 2007 nse values 0 5 for monthly flow sediments and nutrients were considered acceptable model performance the objective function is given below as 2 n s e 1 i 1 n x obs i x sim i 2 i 1 n x obs i x obs 2 where x streamflow ssl x s i m i simulated variable at ith month x o b s i observed variable at ith month x o b s mean observed variable n number of observations under consideration it may result in the deceptive evaluation of the model performance when a single indicator is used instead a set of performance measures like graphical plots relative value error metrics and normalized error metrics are suggested moriasi et al 2015 therefore multiple error metrics namely coefficient of determination r2 nse percentage bias pbias kling gupta efficiency kge and time series plots were used to examine the model performances the nse was used as an objective function while the other metrics were used to assess the adequacy of the calibrated model three iterations were used for each of the three calibration strategies with 500 runs per iteration validation was done with a single simulation that included the best parameters from each calibration method r2 indicates the amount of variance of observations explained by the model where 1 represents the optimum value the pbias examines the trend between the average of the simulated values and the observed ones the zero value of pbias represents a perfect match between observations and model simulation 25 for streamflow and 55 for ssl indicates the good performance ratings as per moriasi et al 2007 model underestimation and overestimation are indicated by the positive and negative value of pbias by breaking the nse index down into its individual components kge is an upgraded version of the nse index in contrast to nse multi component structure of kge includes linear correlation bias and variability inside a single objective function resulting in a more balanced model evaluation when kge 0 41 it indicates that it is better to use the observed mean as a predictor knoben et al 2019 if a performance is over 0 75 or 0 5 on the kge scale it is regarded as good or intermediate performance respectively brighenti et al 2019b the perfect value of the kge is one 3 r 2 i 1 n x obs i x obs x sim i x sim i 1 n x obs i x obs 2 2 i 1 n x sim i x sim 2 2 2 4 p b i a s i 1 n x obs i x sim i i 1 n x obs i 100 5 kge 1 γ 1 2 α 1 2 β 1 2 where γ is the correlation coefficient between simulated and observed data α is ratio of the mean of simulated and observed data β is the ratio of the standard deviation of simulated and observed data two criteria have been widely applied to examine the goodness of predictive uncertainty a the fraction of observation captured inside the 95 prediction uncertainty 95ppu envelope p factor and b the ratio of the average width of the 95ppu envelope to the standard deviation of the corresponding measured variable r factor p factor of 1 and r factor of zero represent a perfect model but this may never be realistic due to the wide range of uncertainty present in the modelling chain p factor 0 70 and r factor 1 50 according to abbaspour et al 2015 are considered good model performances 2 4 overview of calibration methods and procedure of their comparative assessment three calibration methods sequential sqn simultaneous sml and sequential simultaneous sqn sml were selected for streamflow and ssl modelling parameters related to streamflow and sediment generation are adjusted simultaneously in an sml calibration method wellen et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 the sqn approach first calibrates the streamflow and then the ssl santhi et al 2001 daggupati et al 2015 brighenti et al 2019b while this approach considers the causal linkages between streamflow and ssl it locks the streamflow parameter range when proceeding to the ssl calibration the sqn sml approach starts the calibration with streamflow parameters in the first iteration and with next iteration a simultaneous calibration of streamflow and sediment is done using the initial parameter ranges for sediment and obtained updated sub optimal streamflow parameter range from the first iteration shrestha et al 2016b as mentioned in section 2 3 2 all calibration methods were performed with three iterations to compare the three strategies objectively however only one iteration is performed with streamflow in sequential calibration strategy because we got the optimal parameter range for streamflow in the first iteration as indicated by nse and the number of behavioural solutions the second and third iteration in the sqn calibration strategy corresponds to two iterations with sediment parameter and fixed optimal range streamflow parameters obtained from the first iteration simultaneous calibration strategy consists of three iterations each having both streamflow as well as sediment parameters performance evaluation and parameter uncertainty assessment of model calibrated with three calibration methods was done with an aim to find the best calibration method comparison of three calibration methods was done based on following criteria a conventional method of model performance evaluation using four goodness of fit statistics nse pbias r2 and kge b model performance evaluation for low mid and high streamflow and ssl regimes using the streamflow and sediment duration curve comparison c model performance evaluation for the specific variables like peak discharge ssl hydrograph sedimentograph volume low mid and high streamflow ssl d predictive uncertainty evaluation using p and r factors and model equifinality assessment using the number of behavioral solutions e parameter uncertainty assessment using final calibrated parameter range and using the normalized uncertainty score see equation 6 detail of these criteria was discussed in the appropriate sections of the paper 2 5 model performances evaluation under extreme hydrological regimes the flow duration curve fdc is a valuable tool for comparing the performance of a hydrologic model to the actual watershed system behaviours yilmaz et al 2008 proposed categorizing fdc into three categories high low and mid range which constitute essential hydrological signatures therefore duration curves of streamflow and ssl were partitioned into three parts as per exceedance probability to emphasize model simulation accuracy in extreme regimes pfannerstill et al 2014 haas et al 2016 duration curves with 0 20 20 80 and 80 100 exceedance probability range under three calibration methods were considered separately to examine the model adequacy for high mid and low regimes simulation respectively also simulation accuracy of the variables like peak discharge and associated hydrograph volume peak ssl and associated sedimentograph volume low mid and high streamflow and ssl were assessed using the nse and nrmse indices under three calibration approaches for the combined calibration and validation period peak discharge and peak ssl were extracted annually from respective timeseries data for the whole period hydrograph sedimentograph were separated from timeseries by visually identifying beginning and end of respective hydrograph sedimentograph corresponding to the annual peak discharge ssl 2 6 parameter uncertainty and model equifinality model equifinality and parameter uncertainty are closely interlinked these were assessed following the methodology of rajib et al 2016 higher model equifinality leads to greater parameter uncertainty several parameter sets may exist within the final optimized range producing behavioural solutions having equally satisfactory performances beven and binley 1992 beven 2006 all parameter values within their final calibrated range and having an objective function greater than a predetermined threshold nse 0 5 are considered behavioral parameters in this study to reduce the parameter uncertainty to 0 1 scale for easy and fair comparison all the behavioral parameters were converted to this scale following the normalization eq 6 6 r n r b l l u l l l where r n is the normalized uncertainty score r b is the behavioral parameter value from the final iteration u l and l l belong to initial parameter space in the first iteration 3 results and discussion the result of relative performances of swat simulation under sqn sml and sqn sml calibration methods are presented and discussed in this section simulated streamflow and ssl under the three model calibration strategies were compared with the measured counterparts with the corresponding decrease in the parameter uncertainty range the possible decrease in equifinality is measured performance measures such as goodness of fit statistics duration curves and hydrographs comparison observed vs simulated parametric uncertainty and predictive uncertainty for the monthly flow and suspended sediment simulations have been investigated to show the difference between the three calibration methods duration curves for extremes regime high flow ssl and low flow ssl were also analyzed to examine the suitability of three calibration approaches for simulation of extreme events also the variables like low mid and high streamflow and ssl hydrograph and sedimentograph characteristics peak flow ssl and corresponding volume were evaluated for three calibration strategies with nse and nrmse nrmse rmse standard deviation of observed variable indices to strengthen the comparative analysis the findings are discussed below 3 1 model performance evaluation under three calibration methods table 2 illustrates the error metrics of the three calibration strategies after an equal number of model simulations for calibration and validation periods r2 nse pbias and kge for streamflow ranged from 0 85 to 0 91 0 86 0 92 0 78 0 91 0 73 0 92 1 7 16 4 4 2 16 5 and 0 65 0 95 0 57 0 94 respectively during calibration validation period sqn sml calibration exhibited the lowest amount of bias pbais 1 7 4 2 highest nse 0 91 0 92 kge 0 95 0 94 and r2 0 91 0 92 when the fit scores were compared for streamflow across calibration schemes during calibration and validation period table 2 comparison of monthly simulated streamflow hydrographs under three calibration approaches with observed streamflow hydrograph fig 2 a showed overall good similarities and satisfactory model performance for each calibration strategy in both calibration and validation period however fig 2a showed that the sqn calibration approach overestimated the low flow and underestimated the peak flow most of the time suggesting that the sqn calibration scheme may be the least performing strategy out of three strategies table 4 the model components are calibrated sequentially using the sequential method this method can lock the model into a parameter setting that is adequate for one variable but prevents proper simulation of other variables this is especially true for sediment modelling where a minor compromise in streamflow simulation can result in dramatically improved sediment simulations bergström et al 2002 in contrast the sqn sml calibration approach performed well in extreme flow regime both low and high streamflow simulation as nse and nrmse value for both high and low streamflow for sqn sml were much better than sqn method suggesting that the sqn sml calibration scheme may be used to simulate extreme flow events table 4 sqn sml approach has the advantage of both sqn and sml approaches as it uses the acceptable but sub optimal streamflow parameters from the first phase to do the simultaneous calibration of both sediment and streamflow in the final phase of calibration thus it does not lock the sub optimal streamflow parameter which is the major deficiency of the sqn calibration process and does not start the simultaneous calibration from the initial streamflow parameter range which may be a major deficiency of the sml approach the sml approach was also advocated by wellen et al 2014 our results are also consistent with previous studies that have shown that the sqn sml approach is better than the sqn approach bergström et al 2002 zhang et al 2016 brighenti et al 2019b r2 varied from 0 61 to 0 65 0 54 0 61 nse varied from 0 6 to 0 64 0 52 0 55 pbias varied from 8 1 to 4 17 9 29 8 and kge varied from 0 63 to 0 65 0 47 0 53 for suspended sediment simulation during calibration validation suggesting near equal performances of all three calibration strategies for suspended sediment simulation all three approaches performed equally good for ssl simulation fig 2b as the comparison didn t reveal significant differences among suspended sediment simulation by three calibration approaches the sqn calibration technique delivered the best sediment simulation result but it performed the poorest of all three calibration schemes for streamflow simulation while comparing the goodness of fit result though the sqn approach has the advantage of accommodating the causal linkages of the streamflow and sediment generation process it does not permit any modification of the streamflow parameter ranges while doing the sediment calibration this procedure is adopted even though semi distributed catchment scale models are over parameterized therefore choosing a single parameter set of streamflow for subsequent sediment calibrations may be sub optimal wellen et al 2014 overall it is evident that all three calibration approaches provided satisfactory simulation results for streamflow and suspended sediment as per moriasi et al 2007 also the goodness of fit scores of streamflow were better than suspended sediment load for all calibration strategies this may be due to higher structural and data uncertainty in the sediment modelling than the streamflow modelling except for year 2004 2005 2007 2009 and 2012 sqn technique fared worse than sqn sml for simulating peak discharge fig s1 and sqn sml method outperformed sqn method for simulating hydrograph volume for the entire period except 2005 2009 and 2012 fig s2 sqn sml technique outperformed sml method for peak discharge simulation for all years except 2003 2004 2005 2007 2009 and 2012 fig s1 and sqn sml method outperformed sml method for hydrograph volume simulation for all years except 2003 2005 2009 and 2012 fig s2 also we investigated model performance using nse and nrmse indices for peak discharge and associated hydrograph volume peak ssl and associated sedimentograph volume individually to provide a more quantitative understanding of the performance of three calibration procedures table 3 for the sqn sml sml and sqn approaches the nse nrmse values for peak discharge were 0 6 61 5 0 51 67 2 and 0 05 98 and for hydrograph volume 0 84 38 8 0 71 52 and 0 34 77 7 respectively this demonstrates that the sqn sml method outperformed the sqn as well as sml method in terms of peak discharge and hydrograph volume simulation although the sml calibration approach outperformed sqn calibration approaches it did not improve model performance over the sqn sml method for streamflow table 2 peak discharge and hydrograph volume simulation table 3 peak ssl nse nrmse values for the sqn sml sml and sqn approaches were 0 08 91 8 0 1 91 and 0 14 89 respectively and sedimentograph volume nse nrmse values were 0 11 90 2 0 13 89 5 and 0 15 88 1 also figs s3 and s4 did not show any major improvement of one method over the others for peak ssl and sedimentograph volume simulation respectively this demonstrates that the all three methods performed similarly in terms of peak ssl and sedimentograph volume simulation 3 2 model performance assessments under extreme flow and ssl regimes as the frequency analysis of streamflow and ssl is crucial for extreme hazard assessment and management capability of three calibration approaches in reproducing the observed flow and sediment duration curve in three portions were evaluated as depicted in figs 3 and 4 the duration curve of streamflow and ssl were segmented into three parts based on exceedance probability monthly streamflow was ranked in descending order to plot the flow duration curve then monthly ranked streamflow qi were plotted as a function of their corresponding exceedance probability pi i n 1 where i is the rank and n is the total number of months under consideration comparison of simulated duration curve with observed counterpart in 0 20 20 80 and 80 100 exceedance probability regions represent performance of calibration strategies in high mid and low regime of hydro sedimentological variables flow duration curve under all three namely high mid and low flow regime indicates sqn sml calibration s superiority over sqn calibration in both calibration and validation period as shown in fig 3 the investigation of the duration curve for ssl shows that both sqn sml and sml calibration schemes performed better than sqn calibration for simulation of low and mid suspended sediment regimes fig 4 however all three approaches have performed similarly in high sediment simulation in both calibration and validation periods fig 4 a d also we investigated model performance using nse and nrmse for low mid and high streamflow ssl individually to provide a more quantitative understanding of the performance of three calibration procedures table 4 we found that nse nrmse values for high mid and low streamflow were 0 66 57 0 71 53 5 and 1 88 166 7 for sqn sml approach 0 55 65 8 0 52 68 6 and 1 48 154 6 for sml approach and 0 14 91 3 0 67 57 2 and 50 34 703 6 for sqn method respectively this again shows that sqn sml method outperformed the sqn method in the simulation of all three streamflow regimes we also discovered that nse nrmse values for high mid and low ssl were 0 3 81 5 2 173 9 and 160 1244 4 for sqn sml approach 0 307 81 7 3 6 214 2 and 163 1255 7 for sml approach and 0 35 79 4 1 25 149 4 and 98 9733 for sqn method respectively implying that sqn performed better than sqn sml for high and mid ssl but sqn sml performed better than sqn for low ssl due to the much lower nrmse value for sqn sml method than that for sqn method overall the sqn calibration technique delivered the comparatively better sediment simulation result but it performed the poorest of all three calibration schemes for streamflow simulation 3 3 predictive uncertainty and model equifinality the r factor varied from 0 41 to 0 6 for suspended sediment simulation during calibration suggesting near equal performances of all three calibration strategies at the same time p factor was estimated to be 0 46 0 71 and 0 97 respectively for sml sqn and sqn sml calibration in case of sediment simulation thus sqn sml strategy produced the highest p factor for sediment simulation indicating minimal model error for sediment when nse was equal to or 0 50 simulations were considered behavioural in this study the higher the number of behavioural solutions the higher is model equifinality nemri and kinnard 2020 the number of behavioural solutions was 500 for streamflow and 94 for sediment in the sqn calibration method in contrast sml calibration gave 420 behavioural solutions out of 500 for both streamflow and suspended sediment whereas sqn sml calibration gave 229 out of 500 for both streamflow and suspended sediment thus sqn sml produced the least equifinal solution while the sqn produced the highest equifinal solution the nse 0 5 threshold was set arbitrarily but when we conducted the sensitivity of threshold on the number of behavioral solutions we still found that sqn sml gave lesser number of behavioural solutions for streamflow than sqn calibration method table 5 3 4 parameter uncertainty assessment under three calibration methods table 6 shows the optimized parameter value and final optimized parameter range computed as the difference between the upper and lower limits for the three calibration strategies except for five parameters related to sediment simulation usle k cov1 cov2 prf bsn spcon all parameters showed a decrease in uncertainty in sqn sml calibration compared to sqn as shown in table 6 the output of sml calibration is the more interesting because it shows a significant reduction in uncertainty for all the parameters involved table 6 however the calibrated parameter space and optimum parameter set producing the best objective function value may not always represent the catchment condition while still providing acceptable results rajib and merwade 2016 the behavioural range of parameters can be used to assess the reduction in equifinality and associated degree of uncertainty as a result the lower the degree of equifinality the narrower the behavioural range vrugt and beven 2018 this section calculates the uncertainty in parameters under three calibration approaches by applying eq 6 transforming each behavioral parameter value into a normalized uncertainty score fig 5 presents the normalised uncertainty score of the ten most sensitive parameters under three calibration methods the p values of global sensitvity analysis were used to identify most sensitive parameters table 7 a small change in parameter value with a lower p value results in a larger change in simulation output it is evident from fig 5 that sqn have the highest uncertainty score spread as reflected by the interquartile range for all the parameters except spcon and prf bsn which indicates the higher equifinality problem of the sqn method the calibration using the sqn sml and sml strategy reduced the number of equifinal streamflow parameters sets and their dispersion fig 5 the range i e the difference between the upper and lower limit of the parameter value and interquartile range of the parameters for streamflow was significantly reduced when using the sqn sml and sml method compared to the sqn method fig 5 thus the sml and sqn sml method resulted in a reduced number of equifinal streamflow parameter sets than the sqn method this demonstrates the striking impact of the simultaneous approach on reducing parameter uncertainty consistent with the finding of brighenti et al 2019b 4 summary and conclusions this study investigated three operational calibration procedures namely sqn sml and sqn sml to model streamflow and suspended sediment using the swat model the performance of calibration approaches is examined in terms of simulation accuracy of streamflow and ssl at the basin outlet during the calibration and validation period flow and sediment duration curves were segmented into high mid and low regions as per probability of exceedance to assess the calibration performance under three regimes finally parameter uncertainty and model equifinality were assessed using the analysis of behavioural solutions when comparing the goodness of fit scores for streamflow across calibration schemes for the calibration and validation period sqn sml calibration had the least level of bias pbais 1 7 4 2 the highest nse 0 91 0 92 kge 0 95 0 94 and r2 0 95 0 94 according to segmented flow duration curve analysis sqn sml performed the best among the three techniques under all three flow regimes but as per segmented sediment duration curve analysis sqn sml outperformed sqn only in the mid and low ssl regimes whereas all three calibration approaches performed comparably in the high ssl regime the sml technique produced the minimal parameter uncertainty followed by sqn sml and sqn also the sqn sml method yielded the highest p factor for sediment simulation suggesting the least model error for sediment sqn sml generated the least equifinal solution whereas sqn produced the most equifinal solution while the findings of this research are encouraging the proposed solution must be supported by further studies using different hydrological models and hydro climatic environments we believe that using all available calibration variables streamflow et soil moisture sediment simultaneously could produce substantial improvement in calibration performances and physical realism of model thereby reducing the risk of compensatory and overparameterization issue due to insufficiently constrained model rajib et al 2018 dembélé et al 2020 franco et al 2020 the improved predictive skills and reduced parameter equifinality will significantly contribute to studies relating to long term impacts of climate and land use change hydro climatic extreme event predictions sediment prediction and management and nutrient prediction overall the study s findings are expected to support the decision making of calibration choices and its implication

3019,high permeability sand gravel trenches surrounding utility pipes are deemed to create preferential pathways for water in the subsurface of urban environments although this can be true when both trench filling material and surrounding soils are fully water saturated the same is not obvious in the unsaturated zone this study explores the behavior of these anthropogenic features in the unsaturated zone and their role in the formation of the urban karst with specific interest to the fate of water leaked from utility pipelines and its potential to affect urban aquifers a series of 3d steady state numerical simulations was performed assuming two groups of nearby utility trenches hosting a water pipeline up to 6 concurrent leaks different leak rates native soil properties slopes of the utility trenches and initial water saturation profiles the analysis showed that utility trenches in the unsaturated zone are more likely an obstacle to water flow originated from leaking water utilities indeed they served as capillary barriers rather than sinks in the simulations although with a limited diversion capacity nevertheless a pronounced lateral spreading of leaked water within the trenches was predicted in some scenarios which suggests that there is still potential for the urban karst effect to occur when native soil properties are not that far from those of the trench filling material although high initial effective water saturations would be required in this case keywords pipe leakage utility trench urban karst capillary barrier groundwater recharge unsaturated zone data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction all utility pipes used for freshwater supply or for wastewater and stormwater removal are destined to leak during their lifetime because of several factors e g pipe aging and corrosion poor initial laying and construction displacements and damages induced by land movements traffic nearby construction sites tree roots etc water leakage can stress existing natural freshwater resources thus contributing to their depletion especially in areas where prolonged droughts and severe water scarcity are already a concern more water is therefore extracted to meet user demands and in turn more energy is required by pumping stations and treatment plants leading to increased greenhouse gases emissions as fossil fuels are still largely used in the water industry stokes et al 2014 soil and groundwater contamination is also a concern since large volumes of wastewater and stormwater are lost every year through sewers wakida and lerner 2005 chisala and lerner 2008 vázquez suñé et al 2005 tubau et al 2017 burri et al 2019 in addition water lost in the subsurface can flood underground spaces e g basements and tunnels induce foundations corrosion excessive hydrostatic stress and structures uplift vázquez suñé et al 2005 attard et al 2016 even when pressure management active leakage control pipes rehabilitation and repair are a common practice every year in big cities water infrastructures suffer leaks of millions of cubic meters lambert et al 2015a 2015b as a result a tremendous amount of water is lost in the subsurface the term lost however is not completely correct as leaking water utilities can potentially recharge urban aquifers lerner 1986 price and reed 1989 lerner 1990 foster 2001 lerner 2002 hibbs and sharp 2012 bhaskar et al 2016 han et al 2017 this is strictly case dependent and while in some parts of the world leaking water utilities were deemed as the major contributor to groundwater recharge lerner 1986 yang et al 1999 kim et al 2001 vázquez suñé et al 2010 kruse et al 2013 lancia et al 2019 lancia et al 2020 in others their contribution was considered minimal jeppesen et al 2011 minnig et al 2018 therefore it is still debatable to which extent this occurs and if this water can be reused as urban soils are generally polluted furthermore the presence of several distinct sources of recharge e g infiltration from paved surfaces irrigation of gardens and parks stormwater infiltration facilities septic tanks etc together with the scarcity of data makes it challenging to distinguish the effects of leaking pipes on urban aquifers the urban subsurface is a complex entanglement of shallow and deep anthropogenic alterations buildings basements and foundations excavations tunnels underground constructions and the dense network of utility pipelines can all potentially affect the migration of water and contaminants hibbs and sharp 2012 in particular the high permeability sand gravel trenches surrounding utility pipes are expected to create a preferential pathway resulting in the so called urban karst kaushal and belt 2012 bonneau et al 2017 bonneau et al 2018a bonneau et al 2018b appendix this is surely the case when both trench filling material and native soil are fully water saturated and the former has a distinctly higher intrinsic permeability sharp et al 2003 shepley et al 2020 however what happens when these high permeability trenches and the surrounding soil are unsaturated what is the fate of water leaked from utility pipelines in these circumstances conventionally leaking water utilities are supposed to recharge urban aquifers no matter the urban karst and water balance calculations at the catchment scale often support this idea however it may be the case that these calculations are not supported by piezometry and chemical signature analysis or simply the scale of the problem under exam is so big that the complexity of the urban subsurface cannot be accurately considered as a result the amount of recharge induced by leaking water utilities simply becomes a calibration parameter to find closure to a water balance therefore more physical knowledge at a smaller scale would help researchers and practitioners to include the effects of the urban karst in their calculations and to enable a better identification and quantification of urban aquifers recharge d aniello et al 2021 made a first attempt to identify the drivers of the urban karst and to describe its effects on the fate of water leaked from utility pipes laid in the unsaturated zone through 3d numerical simulations at the pipe scale they showed that the urban karst could actually alter the migration pathway of leaked water directly at the utility trench however specific conditions must be met for this to happen depending on retention properties initial effective water saturation relative permeability and intrinsic permeability of both trench filling material and native soil although this analysis included a wide range of native soil properties and slopes of the utility trench different leak rates and depths of the groundwater table this was limited to a single pipe defect and to a simple conceptualization of the subsurface surrounding the utility trench moreover as described in d aniello et al 2021 the assumption of equilibrium of water in the unsaturated zone with the groundwater table i e equal initial hydraulic head throughout the numerical domain might have introduced a bias thus potentially underestimating the effects of the urban karst the work presented hereinafter overcomes these assumptions and provides a description of the fate of leaked water in a more complex subsurface environment the goal is to understand the migration pathway of water leaked from multiple pipe defects in a crowded subsurface i e in presence of several nearby high permeability utility trenches therefore multiple leaks of different magnitude were modeled in presence of multiple utility trenches if these anthropogenic features act either as capillary barriers appendix or as sinks is explored under a range of native soil properties and slopes of the utility trenches the effects of increased water availability in the shallow subsurface are also examined to infer how a considerably higher water saturation might magnify or reduce the effects of the urban karst on leaked water 2 methodology 2 1 conceptual model and outline of the simulations two groups of nearby utility trenches hosting a leaking water pipeline and surrounded by native soil form the conceptual model fig 1 the two groups are laid with an offset of 1 5 m along the vertical and their longitudinal directions are orthogonal the group located in the upper part of the domain will be referred to as ut upper trenches whereas the other as lt lower trenches each group consists of three utility trenches defined according to the group name ut or lt together with the suffix l left m middle and r right depending on their location horizontally utility trenches on the left and on the right are placed at 1 m distance from the one in the middle while vertically the left trench is lowered by 0 594 m i e the height of the embedment appendix with respect to the trench in the middle and the one on the right by half this measure this specific configuration within each group was chosen to potentially add a bit more variability in the resulting flow paths of leaked water as most native soils can be used for the backfill howard 1996 milano 1996 yorkshire water 2018 only the embedment of each trench is depicted in fig 1 according to the soil conservation service scs textural classification usda scs 1987 two major textural groups with soil properties distinctly different than the trench filling material were chosen as backfill native soil namely a sandy clay loam and a clay loam conversely a sand was chosen for the embedment as cohesionless free draining soils e g sands or gravels are usually preferred for this layer for simplicity all utility trenches have the same dimensions fig 1 obtained as combination of the guidelines of different countries howard 1996 milano 1996 yorkshire water 2018 and chosen to represent a typical utility trench suitable for both rigid and flexible pipes for each trench group the slopes along the longitudinal direction of both pipes and utility trenches were varied between 0 and 10 with respect to the horizontal thus providing a wide range of variation all trenches host a pipe of the same size fig 1 which resembles a pressurized water distribution main this choice was dictated by the greater availability of information on real losses in water distribution systems however this does not affect the broader applicability of the conceptual model as water flow within the pipes is not modeled as a result pipe dimensions are just indicative and their material is not specified each pipe can leak from the entire length of one of its joints located in the middle of the pipeline in a well managed water infrastructure in good conditions low leak rates of long duration are typically responsible for most of the water lost lambert et al 1999 lambert and mckenzie 2002 lambert 2009 therefore leak rates were chosen to mimic background real losses assuming a minimum loss of 0 48 l m d lambert et al 1999 however this value is hardly attained in practice therefore it was increased by a factor of 5 to depict the behavior of a wider range of real water distribution systems lambert et al 2015a 2015b as a result assuming each pipeline to be made of 6 m length pipes leak rates were varied between 2 88 and 14 4 l d for each leaky joint furthermore water was allowed to leak alternatively from i the upper middle pipe ii all upper pipes and iii all pipes to explore the effects of increased water availability in the unsaturated zone on the migration pathways of leaked water in presence of high permeability trenches two cases were considered in the first case a water within the unsaturated zone is assumed in equilibrium with a static groundwater table i e the initial hydraulic head is the same throughout the numerical domain placed at 1 m from the bottom of the domain fig 1 in order to have low initial water saturations in both utility trenches and native soil before the onset of the leaks in the second case b the groundwater table is supposed to be far below the bottom of the domain and large volumes of stormwater are allowed to infiltrate from the top both before and during pipe leakage in order to increase considerably water saturations within the model domain effective water saturation profiles before pipe leakage are shown in fig 2 the presence of a paved surface on top of the domain fig 1 is just indicative of an urban environment this surface is assumed either in perfect conditions hence completely impermeable during dry weather case a or at an advanced level of deterioration case b to allow a strong and spatially uniform vertical infiltration of stormwater from the top of the domain during prolonged wet weather conditions sec 2 2 indeed this is a simplification of the processes occurring at the surface level as stormwater can infiltrate through damages or cracks of the urban pavement as well as through other damaged impervious surfaces and vegetated areas thus resulting in localized infiltration spots however a spatially uniform infiltration of stormwater from the top of the domain was preferred with respect to a more realistic patchy distribution in order to model a limit case that would have allowed water saturation to increase everywhere within the domain while reducing model complexity therefore the characteristics of the pavement are not specified and stormwater infiltration through it is not directly modeled overall 96 scenarios including two initial conditions dry weather and wet weather case a and case b 2 native soil properties sandy clay loam and clay loam scl and cl 2 slopes of the utility trenches 0 and 10 s0 and s10 for both groups upper and lower trenches ut and lt 3 defect configurations 1 3 and 6 pipe defects pd1 pd3 and pd6 and 2 leak rates 2 88 l d and 14 4 l d l1 and l5 were modeled to reproduce a persistent leak simulations were run under steady state 2 2 numerical modeling numerical simulations were performed under steady state with the subsurface flow module richards equation interface of comsol multiphysics version 5 6 0 401 comsol 2020 which solves the pressure based formulation of richards equation bear 1972 by the finite element method the model domain is 14 m 14 m 6 m sufficiently big to avoid any interaction between leaked water and lateral boundary conditions two different sets of boundary and initial conditions were applied depending on the weather scenario namely case a or case b table 1 during dry weather case a a fixed hydraulic head of 1 m was set for both bottom and lateral boundaries except for the surface of the pipes and for the top of the domain where a no flux boundary condition was applied before the onset of the leaks water is in equilibrium with the static groundwater table hence the same hydraulic head 1 m was chosen as initial condition for the entire domain conversely during wet weather case b a no flux boundary condition was enforced for the lateral boundaries whereas the bottom of the domain was set as a free drainage boundary i e a unit gradient is imposed in the vertical direction then due to gravity there is an outflow flux equal to the hydraulic conductivity at the given pressure head in that specific location at the top of the domain a fixed pressure head of 0 1 m was applied to simulate a strong vertical infiltration of stormwater into the model domain for each wet weather scenario initial conditions prior to the leaks were obtained by running a steady state simulation with the aforementioned boundary conditions then the leaks were applied according to the specific scenario in both case a and case b leaks from the pipe defects were modeled with a constant flux boundary condition leak rates of 2 88 l d and 14 4 l d for each leaky joint on average the model domain was discretized with roughly 2 1 million irregular tetrahedra as the slope of the trenches changes the number of elements slightly changes as well and element sizes range between 3 7 and 48 6 cm the mesh was also refined at each leaky joint and within the utility trenches calculations were run with an intel core i9 8950hk cpu running at 2 9 ghz with 16 gb ram and convergence of the non linear solver was ensured by a relative tolerance of 0 001 soil properties table 2 appendix were taken from the large and detailed dataset of carsel and parrish 1988 whereas constitutive relationships i e capillary pressure saturation and relative permeability saturation were described with the van

permeability trenches at close distance 1 1 5 m between each other fig 1 leaked water moves predominantly downward however some key differences can be noted among the scenarios 3 1 1 dry weather scenarios case a during dry weather case a in the pd1 scenarios i e joint defect at the upper middle pipe the effective water saturation mostly increases within the native soil below the upper middle trench ut m with an evident accumulation of water on top of the lower middle trench lt m both in sandy clay loam scl and clay loam cl scenarios figs 3 and 4 supplementary data effective water saturation increases as well within the embedment of ut m although limited to the close vicinity of the defect the surrounding trenches are practically not affected by pipe leakage and water mostly flows around them when the leak rate is the lowest 2 88 l d l1 this does not change much when the leak rate increases 14 4 l d l5 although slightly more water is retained within the lower trenches than their counterpart at the upper level table 3 especially in lt m which is right beneath the leak in general as the leak rate increases effective water saturations increase mostly within the native soil and in the embedment of ut m in proximity to the leak and the plume of leaked water retained within the domain becomes wider figs 3 and 4 supplementary data the vertical offset of left and right trenches with respect to the one in the middle has little effect on the migration pathway of leaked water other than inducing a slightly higher accumulation of water on top of ut l and lt r the shape of the plume of leaked water retained within the domain becomes slightly less symmetric as the slope of the trenches varies from 0 s0 to 10 s10 and the most noticeable changes can be found in the embedment of ut m especially in clay loam scenarios and on top of lt m where effective water saturations increase downdip along the longitudinal direction of the trench as expected this becomes more evident as the leak rate increases however this phenomenon is spatially limited and water flow still occurs mostly downward overall all trenches retain only a very small amount of leaked water 23 113 l ranging between 0 9 and 1 9 of the total leaked volume retained within the system table 3 in the pd3 scenarios i e joint defect at all upper pipes during dry weather case a the migration pathway of leaked water is similar to the one previously discussed except that more water is retained within the system and the plume of leaked water is wider figs 3 and 4 supplementary data table 3 as expected the amount of water retained within the embedment of each lateral upper trench increases however strikingly there is practically no increase in the effective water saturation hence of leaked water retained within the upper middle trench with respect to pd1 scenarios despite being laterally surrounded at a short distance 1 1 5 m by other leaking pipes the effective water saturation and the amount of leaked water retained in the left and the right upper trench ut l and ut r are practically the same of those of the upper middle trench ut m in pd1 and pd3 scenarios thus suggesting no significant influence between each leaking pipe at the upper level lower trenches retain more water as well table 3 comparable to the upper trenches as in pd1 in particular lt m now always shows higher volumes of leaked water retained as it is right beneath the 3 upper leaks however the total amount of leaked water retained by all trenches is still very small 74 259 l although as expected a bit higher than in pd1 given the presence of additional leaks and ranges between 1 4 and 2 7 of the total leaked volume retained within the system table 3 as the defects occur in the lower pipes as well pd6 there is practically no change in the overall behavior of the trenches at the upper level during dry weather case a indeed here effective water saturations and the amount of leaked water retained are nearly identical to those of the pd3 scenarios figs 3 and 4 supplementary data table 3 no significant change is registered in the native soil as well except for a slight increase in the dimensions of the plume of leaked water retained in proximity to lower leaks as expected the amount of leaked water retained increases within the embedment of lower trenches table 3 which is always higher than those at the upper level again especially in lt m as it lies beneath the 3 upper leaks overall there is just a small increase in the total volume of leaked water retained within the system with all trenches retaining from 1 9 to 2 9 of it 102 303 l leaked water within lower trenches behaves in the same way as in the upper trenches and water flow within the system is still directed downward 3 1 2 wet weather scenarios case b during wet weather case b the increase in effective water saturation within the system is overall lower than during dry weather figs 5 and 6 supplementary data and almost negligible in the native soil which is already near to complete saturation before the onset of the leaks fig 2 in the sandy clay loam scenarios scl of case b the increase in effective water saturation is limited to the close vicinity of the pipe defects when the leaks occur a slight increase in effective water saturation can be noticed in lt m as well even when not directly affected by pipe leakage pd1 and pd3 as it lies directly beneath the upper leaks indeed as the leak rate increases l5 effective water saturations and the amount of leaked water retained increase as well within the embedment of the trenches whereas no substantial deformation of the plume of leaked water retained can be observed as their slope varies from 0 to 10 s0 and s10 despite being at a short distance 1 1 5 m each leaking pipe does not interact much with the neighboring trenches and water flow still occurs mostly downward indeed no increase in effective water saturation and in the volume of leaked water retained is registered within ut m as the number of leaks increases fig 5 supplementary data table 4 and lateral trenches show practically the same values once the leak occurs within them just as in case a overall during wet weather all trenches retain from 15 4 to 17 8 of the total volume of leaked water retained within the system in scl scenarios table 4 although these percentages are higher than case a the total volume of leaked water retained within the system is considerably lower in case b up to 2 orders of magnitude tables 3 and 4 therefore in scl scenarios of case b all trenches retain up to approximately 2 36 l in total which is indeed a very small volume by contrast during wet weather clay loam scenarios cl show a distinct lateral spreading of leaked water within the embedment of the trenches once the leaks occur fig 6 supplementary data indeed this becomes more pronounced as the leak rate increases l5 and leaked water moves farther downdip along the longitudinal direction of the trenches as their slope increases to 10 s10 however leaked water does not reach the lateral boundaries of the domain during its migration within the embedment of the trenches and water eventually flows downward in these scenarios as well again as shown by the amount of leaked water retained within each trench and by the variation in effective water saturation fig 6 supplementary data table 4 there is not much interaction between each leaking pipe and the neighboring trenches except with lt m which lies below the upper leaks and lt l which now shows higher values and a more pronounced lateral spreading of leaked water within its embedment this occurs as leaked water moves farther downdip within the upper trenches when their slope reaches the 10 s10 as this water eventually flows downward it encounters lt l during its migration and therefore it is able to interact with it overall in these scenarios as well the percentage of leaked water retained within all trenches is higher than case a now from 34 to 37 6 table 4 however the volume of leaked water retained within the trenches is again very small in total 7 134 l although comparable with case a 3 1 3 pressure field alterations the alterations to the pressure field induced by the leaks further confirm the mostly downward directed movement of leaked water fig 7 indeed even when these alterations are more evident pd6 l5 s10 s10 scenarios the pressure field mostly varies in proximity to the leaks and within the embedment of the trenches the pressure head buildup is the highest in case a in proximity to the upper leaks up to roughly 3 9 m and decreases at increasing distance from the leaks in all scenarios pressure alterations are higher at the upper trenches than those at the lower level in case a given the marked difference in the initial hydraulic conductivity along the vertical fig 2 in case a scl scenarios exhibit a slightly higher pressure head buildup than cl scenarios although the shape of the pressure surge is practically identical i e slightly asymmetric and almost radial the pressure head buildup is spatially limited and definitely lower in case b up to 0 13 m being the initial hydraulic conductivity of several orders of magnitude higher than case a fig 2 overall during wet weather the shape of the pressure surge resembles more a downward directed plume in case b the alterations to the pressure field are higher in cl scenarios and here the distinct pressure increase downdip along the longitudinal direction of the pipes further testifies the more pronounced lateral spreading of leaked water within the embedment of the trenches fig 7 conversely pressure alterations originating from the leaks are practically symmetric and more spatially limited in scl scenarios of case b 4 discussion 4 1 sinks or barriers exploring utility trenches behavior the combined effect of contrasting soil retention properties effective water saturation relative permeability and intrinsic permeability controlled the migration pathway of leaked water in the modeled scenarios during dry weather case a the urban karst effect is irrelevant at the trench level in both sandy clay loam scl and clay loam cl scenarios indeed despite the sand intrinsic permeability being about 1 4 and 2 1 orders of magnitude higher than the two native soils table 2 there is no preferential migration of leaked water within the embedment of the trenches figs 3 and 4 supplementary data table 3 given the structure of soil constitutive relationships i e capillary pressure saturation and relative permeability saturation and the values of soil retention properties table 2 the initial effective water saturation and the resulting relative permeability hydraulic conductivity are so low within the embedment of the trenches fig 2 to make water flow more favorable within the native soil as explained in detail by d aniello et al 2021 during wet weather case b before the onset of the leaks the sand of the embedment is far from saturation fig 2 and yet has practically the same hydraulic conductivity of the surrounding native soil which is by contrast closer to complete saturation therefore the trench filling material would be expected to have a higher potential to allow water flow once the leaks develop however the hydraulic conductivity of both native soils has still a relevant margin for growth up to roughly one order of magnitude once the leaks occur and the effective water saturation locally increases in proximity to the pipe defects as a result supported by gravity leaked water still flows mostly downward within the native soil as it meets more favorable conditions to its flow here however the presence of higher initial effective water saturations did have an influence on the migration pathway of leaked water in case b at least in the clay loam scenarios here a pronounced lateral spreading of leaked water is clearly visible within the embedment of the trenches figs 6 and 7 supplementary data as the spreading ceases at a short distance from the leaks it is not enough to support the occurrence of a fully developed urban karst effect although this suggests that there is still potential for it to occur most likely in the modeled scenarios a further increase in effective water saturation in proximity to the pipe defects either resulting from higher leak rates or from the presence of additional leaks within the same trench or from higher initial effective water saturations would have made water flow more favorable within the embedment despite the concurrent increase in hydraulic conductivity of the native soil therefore the urban karst effect could occur directly at the trench level even when native soil properties are not that far from those of the trench filling material although the effective water saturation within the embedment must be considerably high in this case otherwise the migration of leaked water within the trenches could occur only if native soil properties were even lower than those presented in this work like in d aniello et al 2021 where a silty clay θr 0 07 θs 0 36 α 0 5 m 1 n 1 09 k 6 458 10 15 m2 according to carsel and parrish 1988 allowed the onset of the urban karst effect despite the trench filling material being practically at its residual water content therefore unless the previous conditions are met high permeability sand trenches surrounding utility pipes are likely to behave more as capillary barriers rather than sinks in the unsaturated zone with respect to water leaks a capillary barrier takes place in the unsaturated zone at the interface between soils with contrasting properties namely when a fine layer overlies a coarse layer ross 1990 oldenburg and pruess 1993 ho and webb 1998 walter et al 2000 kämpf et al 2003 in particular the coarse layer is generally characterized by higher values of both intrinsic permeability and retention properties despite pressure being the same at the interface here the coarse layer exhibits a distinctly lower effective water saturation than the fine layer and a sharp difference in hydraulic conductivity arises between the two as long as the capillary pressure or alternatively the effective water saturation does not reach a certain threshold at the interface the hydraulic conductivity of the coarse layer remains markedly lower therefore this layer exerts a diversion effect on water flow within the fine layer thus acting like a barrier as water accumulates at the interface building up pressure i e effective water saturation increases and capillary pressure decreases the hydraulic conductivity difference between the two layers becomes negligible at a certain point and eventually breakthrough occurs within the coarse layer somehow this is what happened in all scenarios indeed leaked water mostly flows downward within the native soil and around the trenches in the modeled scenarios at both upper and lower levels sec 3 1 although breakthrough occurs at the lower trenches this phenomenon is spatially limited as leaked water can easily bypass the capillary barriers by moving over the upper interface of the trenches along their transversal direction figs 3 7 supplementary data which is the shortest path to overcome the obstacle the very small volumes of leaked water retained within the trenches tables 3 and 4 further confirm this 4 2 perspectives and limitations the analysis presented in this work complements the recent findings of d aniello et al 2021 moving a step forward in the understanding of the fate of leaked water in the subsurface of urban environments the current study highlights that in the unsaturated zone anthropogenic features like high permeability sand trenches surrounding utility pipes are more likely an obstacle to water flow originating from nearby leaking water utilities rather than a preferential pathway therefore utility trenches are expected to behave more as capillary barriers rather than sinks in real scenarios however their diversion capacity is likely limited as leaked water can easily bypass them in the native soil for the same reason the failure of the capillary barrier i e leaked water breakthrough is expected to be limited as well nevertheless the numerical analysis suggests that there is still potential for the urban karst effect to occur in the unsaturated zone actually the contrast between trench filling material and native soil must not necessarily be as sharp as in d aniello et al 2021 to make water flow more favorable within the trenches indeed the urban karst effect has another opportunity to occur when native soil properties are closer to those of the embedment that is the presence of high effective water saturations within the trench up to the point to make the hydraulic conductivity higher here than in the native soil however this condition is not likely to be attained easily in real scenarios unless a strong source discharges considerable amounts of water in the subsurface surrounding the utility trenches hosting leaking pipes prolonged and intense rains irrigation stormwater infiltration facilities or a rising groundwater table coupled with high leak rates could be responsible for this indeed the results previously discussed come from a specific conceptual model which cannot be representative of all possible on site conditions for example the number and the type of buried utilities their spatial configuration the dimensions of the surrounding trenches and the characteristics of their filling material the number and the location of pipe defects and the amount of water leaked are rather unpredictable and case dependent therefore a series of choices had to be made when conceiving the conceptual model however most likely these choices did not undermine the general validity of the outcomes of this research in particular the spatial configuration of the pipes trenches was chosen to create a crowded subsurface environment so as to produce many potential obstacles pathways for leaked water within a plausible distance indeed it is unlikely that a utility trench lies directly below a series of aligned joint defects however this configuration served its purpose showing that even when conditions seem favorable to make the trench acting as a sink it does the opposite behaving rather as an obstacle for leaked water the same holds true for the presence of several leaking water utilities within a short distance finally heterogeneity of the native soil was not considered in the present work depending on the type of the heterogeneity its statistics and correlation lengths the spatial variability of native soil properties might either promote or reduce the interaction between leaked water and the surrounding high permeability sand trenches however the number of scenarios required to perform a systematic analysis on the effects of the spatial variability of all relevant soil properties on the fate of leaked water would be formidably high and computationally demanding indeed this aspect deserves further investigation but it falls beyond the scope of the present work 5 conclusions supported by a series of 3d numerical simulations this study explored the fate of water leaked from multiple pipe defects in a crowded subsurface and the influence of high permeability sand trenches on the migration pathway of leaked water in the unsaturated zone the analysis was systematic and included different native soil properties slopes of the utility trenches leak rates initial water saturation profiles and up to 6 concurrent leaks from pipes at close distance between each other 1 1 5 m despite the trench filling material had a considerably higher intrinsic permeability than the native soil its retention properties resulted in much lower effective water saturation and relative permeability thus making water flow more favorable within the native soil in all scenarios leaked water moved predominantly downward flowing around the surrounding trenches with a limited breakthrough as also confirmed by the very small volumes of leaked water retained within them therefore high permeability sand trenches behaved as capillary barriers rather than sinks in the unsaturated zone mostly diverting water flow originated from leaking water utilities however this diversion was limited as leaked water easily bypassed the trenches moving in the native soil along their transversal direction i e the shortest path to overcome the obstacle nevertheless in presence of high initial effective water saturations a pronounced lateral spreading of leaked water was predicted within the trenches in the clay loam scenarios although this water eventually moved downward at a short distance from the leaks this suggests that there is still potential for the urban karst effect to occur when native soil properties are not that far from those of the trench filling material to allow this to happen high effective water saturations would be required within the trenches until the hydraulic conductivity becomes higher here than in the native soil however this is not likely to be attained easily in real scenarios unless there is a considerable increase in water availability within the subsurface surrounding utility trenches e g induced by prolonged and intense rains irrigation stormwater infiltration facilities or a rising groundwater table coupled with high leak rates otherwise the preferential migration of leaked water within the trenches would be limited to the cases where a considerably sharp difference in soil properties exists between native soil and trench filling material therefore in the unsaturated zone anthropogenic features like high permeability sand trenches surrounding utility pipes are more likely to behave as an obstacle to water flow originating from nearby leaking water utilities rather than as a preferential pathway indeed new physical evidence is essential to finally test these results and experiments at the small urban scale e g at the street level would be beneficial a suitable location for these tests should allow gathering information on i the utility pipes their type location structural integrity and leak rates ii the utility trenches their configuration materials and water saturation iii the properties and the spatial variability i e heterogeneity of the surrounding native soil iv the groundwater levels v the additional sources of water in the shallow subsurface other than leaking pipes i e infiltration from paved surfaces irrigation of gardens and parks stormwater infiltration facilities septic tanks etc vi the presence of tree roots which could further divert water flow paths in the subsurface despite the inevitable limitations of the conceptual model here used the outcomes of this research preserve their general validity and their implications go well beyond the sole understanding of the fate of leaked water in the subsurface of urban environments indeed this additional knowledge will help researchers and practitioners to better identify and quantify urban aquifers recharge and alterations so as to improve water balance calculations for the management of the available water resource and to prevent potential negative effects induced by the interaction of leaked water with other anthropogenic features e g flooding of underground spaces like basements and tunnels foundations corrosion excessive hydrostatic stress structures uplift etc moreover it will also allow a better understanding and quantification of the fate of contaminants originating from leaking sewers and other piped networks overall predicting the migration pathways of leaked water can potentially lead to improved monitoring and remedial actions for the management of existing utilities and for the reuse of urban groundwaters for example with this information the location of piezometers and water quality sensors could be optimized to better monitor and interpret pressure and quality alterations within urban aquifers that could help locate and quantify leaks thus enabling faster and more accurate interventions e g pipes repair and rehabilitation soil groundwater treatment and remediation finally the analysis here presented lays the groundwork for future research on the fate of infiltrated stormwater as well indeed the space within the subsurface of urban environments is limited and the interaction between stormwater infiltration facilities and high permeability utility trenches might be inevitable in this case the amount of infiltrated stormwater would be locally high and could follow different infiltration patterns i e intermittent or continuous as a result the urban karst effect induced by high permeability trenches might be more relevant and likely these anthropogenic features will exhibit an alternate intermediate behavior between capillary barriers and sinks depending on stormwater infiltration rates and on the factors shown in this research funding the work of the first author andrea d aniello was financially supported by the fund pon ricerca e

3019,high permeability sand gravel trenches surrounding utility pipes are deemed to create preferential pathways for water in the subsurface of urban environments although this can be true when both trench filling material and surrounding soils are fully water saturated the same is not obvious in the unsaturated zone this study explores the behavior of these anthropogenic features in the unsaturated zone and their role in the formation of the urban karst with specific interest to the fate of water leaked from utility pipelines and its potential to affect urban aquifers a series of 3d steady state numerical simulations was performed assuming two groups of nearby utility trenches hosting a water pipeline up to 6 concurrent leaks different leak rates native soil properties slopes of the utility trenches and initial water saturation profiles the analysis showed that utility trenches in the unsaturated zone are more likely an obstacle to water flow originated from leaking water utilities indeed they served as capillary barriers rather than sinks in the simulations although with a limited diversion capacity nevertheless a pronounced lateral spreading of leaked water within the trenches was predicted in some scenarios which suggests that there is still potential for the urban karst effect to occur when native soil properties are not that far from those of the trench filling material although high initial effective water saturations would be required in this case keywords pipe leakage utility trench urban karst capillary barrier groundwater recharge unsaturated zone data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction all utility pipes used for freshwater supply or for wastewater and stormwater removal are destined to leak during their lifetime because of several factors e g pipe aging and corrosion poor initial laying and construction displacements and damages induced by land movements traffic nearby construction sites tree roots etc water leakage can stress existing natural freshwater resources thus contributing to their depletion especially in areas where prolonged droughts and severe water scarcity are already a concern more water is therefore extracted to meet user demands and in turn more energy is required by pumping stations and treatment plants leading to increased greenhouse gases emissions as fossil fuels are still largely used in the water industry stokes et al 2014 soil and groundwater contamination is also a concern since large volumes of wastewater and stormwater are lost every year through sewers wakida and lerner 2005 chisala and lerner 2008 vázquez suñé et al 2005 tubau et al 2017 burri et al 2019 in addition water lost in the subsurface can flood underground spaces e g basements and tunnels induce foundations corrosion excessive hydrostatic stress and structures uplift vázquez suñé et al 2005 attard et al 2016 even when pressure management active leakage control pipes rehabilitation and repair are a common practice every year in big cities water infrastructures suffer leaks of millions of cubic meters lambert et al 2015a 2015b as a result a tremendous amount of water is lost in the subsurface the term lost however is not completely correct as leaking water utilities can potentially recharge urban aquifers lerner 1986 price and reed 1989 lerner 1990 foster 2001 lerner 2002 hibbs and sharp 2012 bhaskar et al 2016 han et al 2017 this is strictly case dependent and while in some parts of the world leaking water utilities were deemed as the major contributor to groundwater recharge lerner 1986 yang et al 1999 kim et al 2001 vázquez suñé et al 2010 kruse et al 2013 lancia et al 2019 lancia et al 2020 in others their contribution was considered minimal jeppesen et al 2011 minnig et al 2018 therefore it is still debatable to which extent this occurs and if this water can be reused as urban soils are generally polluted furthermore the presence of several distinct sources of recharge e g infiltration from paved surfaces irrigation of gardens and parks stormwater infiltration facilities septic tanks etc together with the scarcity of data makes it challenging to distinguish the effects of leaking pipes on urban aquifers the urban subsurface is a complex entanglement of shallow and deep anthropogenic alterations buildings basements and foundations excavations tunnels underground constructions and the dense network of utility pipelines can all potentially affect the migration of water and contaminants hibbs and sharp 2012 in particular the high permeability sand gravel trenches surrounding utility pipes are expected to create a preferential pathway resulting in the so called urban karst kaushal and belt 2012 bonneau et al 2017 bonneau et al 2018a bonneau et al 2018b appendix this is surely the case when both trench filling material and native soil are fully water saturated and the former has a distinctly higher intrinsic permeability sharp et al 2003 shepley et al 2020 however what happens when these high permeability trenches and the surrounding soil are unsaturated what is the fate of water leaked from utility pipelines in these circumstances conventionally leaking water utilities are supposed to recharge urban aquifers no matter the urban karst and water balance calculations at the catchment scale often support this idea however it may be the case that these calculations are not supported by piezometry and chemical signature analysis or simply the scale of the problem under exam is so big that the complexity of the urban subsurface cannot be accurately considered as a result the amount of recharge induced by leaking water utilities simply becomes a calibration parameter to find closure to a water balance therefore more physical knowledge at a smaller scale would help researchers and practitioners to include the effects of the urban karst in their calculations and to enable a better identification and quantification of urban aquifers recharge d aniello et al 2021 made a first attempt to identify the drivers of the urban karst and to describe its effects on the fate of water leaked from utility pipes laid in the unsaturated zone through 3d numerical simulations at the pipe scale they showed that the urban karst could actually alter the migration pathway of leaked water directly at the utility trench however specific conditions must be met for this to happen depending on retention properties initial effective water saturation relative permeability and intrinsic permeability of both trench filling material and native soil although this analysis included a wide range of native soil properties and slopes of the utility trench different leak rates and depths of the groundwater table this was limited to a single pipe defect and to a simple conceptualization of the subsurface surrounding the utility trench moreover as described in d aniello et al 2021 the assumption of equilibrium of water in the unsaturated zone with the groundwater table i e equal initial hydraulic head throughout the numerical domain might have introduced a bias thus potentially underestimating the effects of the urban karst the work presented hereinafter overcomes these assumptions and provides a description of the fate of leaked water in a more complex subsurface environment the goal is to understand the migration pathway of water leaked from multiple pipe defects in a crowded subsurface i e in presence of several nearby high permeability utility trenches therefore multiple leaks of different magnitude were modeled in presence of multiple utility trenches if these anthropogenic features act either as capillary barriers appendix or as sinks is explored under a range of native soil properties and slopes of the utility trenches the effects of increased water availability in the shallow subsurface are also examined to infer how a considerably higher water saturation might magnify or reduce the effects of the urban karst on leaked water 2 methodology 2 1 conceptual model and outline of the simulations two groups of nearby utility trenches hosting a leaking water pipeline and surrounded by native soil form the conceptual model fig 1 the two groups are laid with an offset of 1 5 m along the vertical and their longitudinal directions are orthogonal the group located in the upper part of the domain will be referred to as ut upper trenches whereas the other as lt lower trenches each group consists of three utility trenches defined according to the group name ut or lt together with the suffix l left m middle and r right depending on their location horizontally utility trenches on the left and on the right are placed at 1 m distance from the one in the middle while vertically the left trench is lowered by 0 594 m i e the height of the embedment appendix with respect to the trench in the middle and the one on the right by half this measure this specific configuration within each group was chosen to potentially add a bit more variability in the resulting flow paths of leaked water as most native soils can be used for the backfill howard 1996 milano 1996 yorkshire water 2018 only the embedment of each trench is depicted in fig 1 according to the soil conservation service scs textural classification usda scs 1987 two major textural groups with soil properties distinctly different than the trench filling material were chosen as backfill native soil namely a sandy clay loam and a clay loam conversely a sand was chosen for the embedment as cohesionless free draining soils e g sands or gravels are usually preferred for this layer for simplicity all utility trenches have the same dimensions fig 1 obtained as combination of the guidelines of different countries howard 1996 milano 1996 yorkshire water 2018 and chosen to represent a typical utility trench suitable for both rigid and flexible pipes for each trench group the slopes along the longitudinal direction of both pipes and utility trenches were varied between 0 and 10 with respect to the horizontal thus providing a wide range of variation all trenches host a pipe of the same size fig 1 which resembles a pressurized water distribution main this choice was dictated by the greater availability of information on real losses in water distribution systems however this does not affect the broader applicability of the conceptual model as water flow within the pipes is not modeled as a result pipe dimensions are just indicative and their material is not specified each pipe can leak from the entire length of one of its joints located in the middle of the pipeline in a well managed water infrastructure in good conditions low leak rates of long duration are typically responsible for most of the water lost lambert et al 1999 lambert and mckenzie 2002 lambert 2009 therefore leak rates were chosen to mimic background real losses assuming a minimum loss of 0 48 l m d lambert et al 1999 however this value is hardly attained in practice therefore it was increased by a factor of 5 to depict the behavior of a wider range of real water distribution systems lambert et al 2015a 2015b as a result assuming each pipeline to be made of 6 m length pipes leak rates were varied between 2 88 and 14 4 l d for each leaky joint furthermore water was allowed to leak alternatively from i the upper middle pipe ii all upper pipes and iii all pipes to explore the effects of increased water availability in the unsaturated zone on the migration pathways of leaked water in presence of high permeability trenches two cases were considered in the first case a water within the unsaturated zone is assumed in equilibrium with a static groundwater table i e the initial hydraulic head is the same throughout the numerical domain placed at 1 m from the bottom of the domain fig 1 in order to have low initial water saturations in both utility trenches and native soil before the onset of the leaks in the second case b the groundwater table is supposed to be far below the bottom of the domain and large volumes of stormwater are allowed to infiltrate from the top both before and during pipe leakage in order to increase considerably water saturations within the model domain effective water saturation profiles before pipe leakage are shown in fig 2 the presence of a paved surface on top of the domain fig 1 is just indicative of an urban environment this surface is assumed either in perfect conditions hence completely impermeable during dry weather case a or at an advanced level of deterioration case b to allow a strong and spatially uniform vertical infiltration of stormwater from the top of the domain during prolonged wet weather conditions sec 2 2 indeed this is a simplification of the processes occurring at the surface level as stormwater can infiltrate through damages or cracks of the urban pavement as well as through other damaged impervious surfaces and vegetated areas thus resulting in localized infiltration spots however a spatially uniform infiltration of stormwater from the top of the domain was preferred with respect to a more realistic patchy distribution in order to model a limit case that would have allowed water saturation to increase everywhere within the domain while reducing model complexity therefore the characteristics of the pavement are not specified and stormwater infiltration through it is not directly modeled overall 96 scenarios including two initial conditions dry weather and wet weather case a and case b 2 native soil properties sandy clay loam and clay loam scl and cl 2 slopes of the utility trenches 0 and 10 s0 and s10 for both groups upper and lower trenches ut and lt 3 defect configurations 1 3 and 6 pipe defects pd1 pd3 and pd6 and 2 leak rates 2 88 l d and 14 4 l d l1 and l5 were modeled to reproduce a persistent leak simulations were run under steady state 2 2 numerical modeling numerical simulations were performed under steady state with the subsurface flow module richards equation interface of comsol multiphysics version 5 6 0 401 comsol 2020 which solves the pressure based formulation of richards equation bear 1972 by the finite element method the model domain is 14 m 14 m 6 m sufficiently big to avoid any interaction between leaked water and lateral boundary conditions two different sets of boundary and initial conditions were applied depending on the weather scenario namely case a or case b table 1 during dry weather case a a fixed hydraulic head of 1 m was set for both bottom and lateral boundaries except for the surface of the pipes and for the top of the domain where a no flux boundary condition was applied before the onset of the leaks water is in equilibrium with the static groundwater table hence the same hydraulic head 1 m was chosen as initial condition for the entire domain conversely during wet weather case b a no flux boundary condition was enforced for the lateral boundaries whereas the bottom of the domain was set as a free drainage boundary i e a unit gradient is imposed in the vertical direction then due to gravity there is an outflow flux equal to the hydraulic conductivity at the given pressure head in that specific location at the top of the domain a fixed pressure head of 0 1 m was applied to simulate a strong vertical infiltration of stormwater into the model domain for each wet weather scenario initial conditions prior to the leaks were obtained by running a steady state simulation with the aforementioned boundary conditions then the leaks were applied according to the specific scenario in both case a and case b leaks from the pipe defects were modeled with a constant flux boundary condition leak rates of 2 88 l d and 14 4 l d for each leaky joint on average the model domain was discretized with roughly 2 1 million irregular tetrahedra as the slope of the trenches changes the number of elements slightly changes as well and element sizes range between 3 7 and 48 6 cm the mesh was also refined at each leaky joint and within the utility trenches calculations were

permeability trenches at close distance 1 1 5 m between each other fig 1 leaked water moves predominantly downward however some key differences can be noted among the scenarios 3 1 1 dry weather scenarios case a during dry weather case a in the pd1 scenarios i e joint defect at the upper middle pipe the effective water saturation mostly increases within the native soil below the upper middle trench ut m with an evident accumulation of water on top of the lower middle trench lt m both in sandy clay loam scl and clay loam cl scenarios figs 3 and 4 supplementary data effective water saturation increases as well within the embedment of ut m although limited to the close vicinity of the defect the surrounding trenches are practically not affected by pipe leakage and water mostly flows around them when the leak rate is the lowest 2 88 l d l1 this does not change much when the leak rate increases 14 4 l d l5 although slightly more water is retained within the lower trenches than their counterpart at the upper level table 3 especially in lt m which is right beneath the leak in general as the leak rate increases effective water saturations increase mostly within the native soil and in the embedment of ut m in proximity to the leak and the plume of leaked water retained within the domain becomes wider figs 3 and 4 supplementary data the vertical offset of left and right trenches with respect to the one in the middle has little effect on the migration pathway of leaked water other than inducing a slightly higher accumulation of water on top of ut l and lt r the shape of the plume of leaked water retained within the domain becomes slightly less symmetric as the slope of the trenches varies from 0 s0 to 10 s10 and the most noticeable changes can be found in the embedment of ut m especially in clay loam scenarios and on top of lt m where effective water saturations increase downdip along the longitudinal direction of the trench as expected this becomes more evident as the leak rate increases however this phenomenon is spatially limited and water flow still occurs mostly downward overall all trenches retain only a very small amount of leaked water 23 113 l ranging between 0 9 and 1 9 of the total leaked volume retained within the system table 3 in the pd3 scenarios i e joint defect at all upper pipes during dry weather case a the migration pathway of leaked water is similar to the one previously discussed except that more water is retained within the system and the plume of leaked water is wider figs 3 and 4 supplementary data table 3 as expected the amount of water retained within the embedment of each lateral upper trench increases however strikingly there is practically no increase in the effective water saturation hence of leaked water retained within the upper middle trench with respect to pd1 scenarios despite being laterally surrounded at a short distance 1 1 5 m by other leaking pipes the effective water saturation and the amount of leaked water retained in the left and the right upper trench ut l and ut r are practically the same of those of the upper middle trench ut m in pd1 and pd3 scenarios thus suggesting no significant influence between each leaking pipe at the upper level lower trenches retain more water as well table 3 comparable to the upper trenches as in pd1 in particular lt m now always shows higher volumes of leaked water retained as it is right beneath the 3 upper leaks however the total amount of leaked water retained by all trenches is still very small 74 259 l although as expected a bit higher than in pd1 given the presence of additional leaks and ranges between 1 4 and 2 7 of the total leaked volume retained within the system table 3 as the defects occur in the lower pipes as well pd6 there is practically no change in the overall behavior of the trenches at the upper level during dry weather case a indeed here effective water saturations and the amount of leaked water retained are nearly identical to those of the pd3 scenarios figs 3 and 4 supplementary data table 3 no significant change is registered in the native soil as well except for a slight increase in the dimensions of the plume of leaked water retained in proximity to lower leaks as expected the amount of leaked water retained increases within the embedment of lower trenches table 3 which is always higher than those at the upper level again especially in lt m as it lies beneath the 3 upper leaks overall there is just a small increase in the total volume of leaked water retained within the system with all trenches retaining from 1 9 to 2 9 of it 102 303 l leaked water within lower trenches behaves in the same way as in the upper trenches and water flow within the system is still directed downward 3 1 2 wet weather scenarios case b during wet weather case b the increase in effective water saturation within the system is overall lower than during dry weather figs 5 and 6 supplementary data and almost negligible in the native soil which is already near to complete saturation before the onset of the leaks fig 2 in the sandy clay loam scenarios scl of case b the increase in effective water saturation is limited to the close vicinity of the pipe defects when the leaks occur a slight increase in effective water saturation can be noticed in lt m as well even when not directly affected by pipe leakage pd1 and pd3 as it lies directly beneath the upper leaks indeed as the leak rate increases l5 effective water saturations and the amount of leaked water retained increase as well within the embedment of the trenches whereas no substantial deformation of the plume of leaked water retained can be observed as their slope varies from 0 to 10 s0 and s10 despite being at a short distance 1 1 5 m each leaking pipe does not interact much with the neighboring trenches and water flow still occurs mostly downward indeed no increase in effective water saturation and in the volume of leaked water retained is registered within ut m as the number of leaks increases fig 5 supplementary data table 4 and lateral trenches show practically the same values once the leak occurs within them just as in case a overall during wet weather all trenches retain from 15 4 to 17 8 of the total volume of leaked water retained within the system in scl scenarios table 4 although these percentages are higher than case a the total volume of leaked water retained within the system is considerably lower in case b up to 2 orders of magnitude tables 3 and 4 therefore in scl scenarios of case b all trenches retain up to approximately 2 36 l in total which is indeed a very small volume by contrast during wet weather clay loam scenarios cl show a distinct lateral spreading of leaked water within the embedment of the trenches once the leaks occur fig 6 supplementary data indeed this becomes more pronounced as the leak rate increases l5 and leaked water moves farther downdip along the longitudinal direction of the trenches as their slope increases to 10 s10 however leaked water does not reach the lateral boundaries of the domain during its migration within the embedment of the trenches and water eventually flows downward in these scenarios as well again as shown by the amount of leaked water retained within each trench and by the variation in effective water saturation fig 6 supplementary data table 4 there is not much interaction between each leaking pipe and the neighboring trenches except with lt m which lies below the upper leaks and lt l which now shows higher values and a more pronounced lateral spreading of leaked water within its embedment this occurs as leaked water moves farther downdip within the upper trenches when their slope reaches the 10 s10 as this water eventually flows downward it encounters lt l during its migration and therefore it is able to interact with it overall in these scenarios as well the percentage of leaked water retained within all trenches is higher than case a now from 34 to 37 6 table 4 however the volume of leaked water retained within the trenches is again very small in total 7 134 l although comparable with case a 3 1 3 pressure field alterations the alterations to the pressure field induced by the leaks further confirm the mostly downward directed movement of leaked water fig 7 indeed even when these alterations are more evident pd6 l5 s10 s10 scenarios the pressure field mostly varies in proximity to the leaks and within the embedment of the trenches the pressure head buildup is the highest in case a in proximity to the upper leaks up to roughly 3 9 m and decreases at increasing distance from the leaks in all scenarios pressure alterations are higher at the upper trenches than those at the lower level in case a given the marked difference in the initial hydraulic conductivity along the vertical fig 2 in case a scl scenarios exhibit a slightly higher pressure head buildup than cl scenarios although the shape of the pressure surge is practically identical i e slightly asymmetric and almost radial the pressure head buildup is spatially limited and definitely lower in case b up to 0 13 m being the initial hydraulic conductivity of several orders of magnitude higher than case a fig 2 overall during wet weather the shape of the pressure surge resembles more a downward directed plume in case b the alterations to the pressure field are higher in cl scenarios and here the distinct pressure increase downdip along the longitudinal direction of the pipes further testifies the more pronounced lateral spreading of leaked water within the embedment of the trenches fig 7 conversely pressure alterations originating from the leaks are practically symmetric and more spatially limited in scl scenarios of case b 4 discussion 4 1 sinks or barriers exploring utility trenches behavior the combined effect of contrasting soil retention properties effective water saturation relative permeability and intrinsic permeability controlled the migration pathway of leaked water in the modeled scenarios during dry weather case a the urban karst effect is irrelevant at the trench level in both sandy clay loam scl and clay loam cl scenarios indeed despite the sand intrinsic permeability being about 1 4 and 2 1 orders of magnitude higher than the two native soils table 2 there is no preferential migration of leaked water within the embedment of the trenches figs 3 and 4 supplementary data table 3 given the structure of soil constitutive relationships i e capillary pressure saturation and relative permeability saturation and the values of soil retention properties table 2 the initial effective water saturation and the resulting relative permeability hydraulic conductivity are so low within the embedment of the trenches fig 2 to make water flow more favorable within the native soil as explained in detail by d aniello et al 2021 during wet weather case b before the onset of the leaks the sand of the embedment is far from saturation fig 2 and yet has practically the same hydraulic conductivity of the surrounding native soil which is by contrast closer to complete saturation therefore the trench filling material would be expected to have a higher potential to allow water flow once the leaks develop however the hydraulic conductivity of both native soils has still a relevant margin for growth up to roughly one order of magnitude once the leaks occur and the effective water saturation locally increases in proximity to the pipe defects as a result supported by gravity leaked water still flows mostly downward within the native soil as it meets more favorable conditions to its flow here however the presence of higher initial effective water saturations did have an influence on the migration pathway of leaked water in case b at least in the clay loam scenarios here a pronounced lateral spreading of leaked water is clearly visible within the embedment of the trenches figs 6 and 7 supplementary data as the spreading ceases at a short distance from the leaks it is not enough to support the occurrence of a fully developed urban karst effect although this suggests that there is still potential for it to occur most likely in the modeled scenarios a further increase in effective water saturation in proximity to the pipe defects either resulting from higher leak rates or from the presence of additional leaks within the same trench or from higher initial effective water saturations would have made water flow more favorable within the embedment despite the concurrent increase in hydraulic conductivity of the native soil therefore the urban karst effect could occur directly at the trench level even when native soil properties are not that far from those of the trench filling material although the effective water saturation within the embedment must be considerably high in this case otherwise the migration of leaked water within the trenches could occur only if native soil properties were even lower than those presented in this work like in d aniello et al 2021 where a silty clay θr 0 07 θs 0 36 α 0 5 m 1 n 1 09 k 6 458 10 15 m2 according to carsel and parrish 1988 allowed the onset of the urban karst effect despite the trench filling material being practically at its residual water content therefore unless the previous conditions are met high permeability sand trenches surrounding utility pipes are likely to behave more as capillary barriers rather than sinks in the unsaturated zone with respect to water leaks a capillary barrier takes place in the unsaturated zone at the interface between soils with contrasting properties namely when a fine layer overlies a coarse layer ross 1990 oldenburg and pruess 1993 ho and webb 1998 walter et al 2000 kämpf et al 2003 in particular the coarse layer is generally characterized by higher values of both intrinsic permeability and retention properties despite pressure being the same at the interface here the coarse layer exhibits a distinctly lower effective water saturation than the fine layer and a sharp difference in hydraulic conductivity arises between the two as long as the capillary pressure or alternatively the effective water saturation does not reach a certain threshold at the interface the hydraulic conductivity of the coarse layer remains markedly lower therefore this layer exerts a diversion effect on water flow within the fine layer thus acting like a barrier as water accumulates at the interface building up pressure i e effective water saturation increases and capillary pressure decreases the hydraulic conductivity difference between the two layers becomes negligible at a certain point and eventually breakthrough occurs within the coarse layer somehow this is what happened in all scenarios indeed leaked water mostly flows downward within the native soil and around the trenches in the modeled scenarios at both upper and lower levels sec 3 1 although breakthrough occurs at the lower trenches this phenomenon is spatially limited as leaked water can easily bypass the capillary barriers by moving over the upper interface of the trenches along their transversal direction figs 3 7 supplementary data which is the shortest path to overcome the obstacle the very small volumes of leaked water retained within the trenches tables 3 and 4 further confirm this 4 2 perspectives and limitations the analysis presented in this work complements the recent findings of d aniello et al 2021 moving a step forward in the understanding of the fate of leaked water in the subsurface of urban environments the current study highlights that in the unsaturated zone anthropogenic features like high permeability sand trenches surrounding utility pipes are more likely an obstacle to water flow originating from nearby leaking water utilities rather than a preferential pathway therefore utility trenches are expected to behave more as capillary barriers rather than sinks in real scenarios however their diversion capacity is likely limited as leaked water can easily bypass them in the native soil for the same reason the failure of the capillary barrier i e leaked water breakthrough is expected to be limited as well nevertheless the numerical analysis suggests that there is still potential for the urban karst effect to occur in the unsaturated zone actually the contrast between trench filling material and native soil must not necessarily be as sharp as in d aniello et al 2021 to make water flow more favorable within the trenches indeed the urban karst effect has another opportunity to occur when native soil properties are closer to those of the embedment that is the presence of high effective water saturations within the trench up to the point to make the hydraulic conductivity higher here than in the native soil however this condition is not likely to be attained easily in real scenarios unless a strong source discharges considerable amounts of water in the subsurface surrounding the utility trenches hosting leaking pipes prolonged and intense rains irrigation stormwater infiltration facilities or a rising groundwater table coupled with high leak rates could be responsible for this indeed the results previously discussed come from a specific conceptual model which cannot be representative of all possible on site conditions for example the number and the type of buried utilities their spatial configuration the dimensions of the surrounding trenches and the characteristics of their filling material the number and the location of pipe defects and the amount of water leaked are rather unpredictable and case dependent therefore a series of choices had to be made when conceiving the conceptual model however most likely these choices did not undermine the general validity of the outcomes of this research in particular the spatial configuration of the pipes trenches was chosen to create a crowded subsurface environment so as to produce many potential obstacles pathways for leaked water within a plausible distance indeed it is unlikely that a utility trench lies directly below a series of aligned joint defects however this configuration served its purpose showing that even when conditions seem favorable to make the trench acting as a sink it does the opposite behaving rather as an obstacle for leaked water the same holds true for the presence of several leaking water utilities within a short distance finally heterogeneity of the native soil was not considered in the present work depending on the type of the heterogeneity its statistics and correlation lengths the spatial variability of native soil properties might either promote or reduce the interaction between leaked water and the surrounding high permeability sand trenches however the number of scenarios required to perform a systematic analysis on the effects of the spatial variability of all relevant soil properties on the fate of leaked water would be formidably high and computationally demanding indeed this aspect deserves further investigation but it falls beyond the scope of the present work 5 conclusions supported by a series of 3d numerical simulations this study explored the fate of water leaked from multiple pipe defects in a crowded subsurface and the influence of high permeability sand trenches on the migration pathway of leaked water in the unsaturated zone the analysis was systematic and included different native soil properties slopes of the utility trenches leak rates initial water saturation profiles and up to 6 concurrent leaks from pipes at close distance between each other 1 1 5 m despite the trench filling material had a considerably higher intrinsic permeability than the native soil its retention properties resulted in much lower effective water saturation and relative permeability thus making water flow more favorable within the native soil in all scenarios leaked water moved predominantly downward flowing around the surrounding trenches with a limited breakthrough as also confirmed by the very small volumes of leaked water retained within them therefore high permeability sand trenches behaved as capillary barriers rather than sinks in the unsaturated zone mostly diverting water flow originated from leaking water utilities however this diversion was limited as leaked water easily bypassed the trenches moving in the native soil along their transversal direction i e the shortest path to overcome the obstacle nevertheless in presence of high initial effective water saturations a pronounced lateral spreading of leaked water was predicted within the trenches in the clay loam scenarios although this water eventually moved downward at a short distance from the leaks this suggests that there is still potential for the urban karst effect to occur when native soil properties are not that far from those of the trench filling material to allow this to happen high effective water saturations would be required within the trenches until the hydraulic conductivity becomes higher here than in the native soil however this is not likely to be attained easily in real scenarios unless there is a considerable increase in water availability within the subsurface surrounding utility trenches e g induced by prolonged and intense rains irrigation stormwater infiltration facilities or a rising groundwater table coupled with high leak rates otherwise the preferential migration of leaked water within the trenches would be limited to the cases where a considerably sharp difference in soil properties exists between native soil and trench filling material therefore in the unsaturated zone anthropogenic features like high permeability sand trenches surrounding utility pipes are more likely to behave as an obstacle to water flow originating from nearby leaking water utilities rather than as a preferential pathway indeed new physical evidence is essential to finally test these results and experiments at the small urban scale e g at the street level would be beneficial a suitable location for these tests should allow gathering information on i the utility pipes their type location structural integrity and leak rates ii the utility trenches their configuration materials and water saturation iii the properties and the spatial variability i e heterogeneity of the surrounding native soil iv the groundwater levels v the additional sources of water in the shallow subsurface other than leaking pipes i e infiltration from paved surfaces irrigation of gardens and parks stormwater infiltration facilities septic tanks etc vi the presence of tree roots which could further divert water flow paths in the subsurface despite the inevitable limitations of the conceptual model here used the outcomes of this research preserve their general validity and their implications go well beyond the sole understanding of the fate of leaked water in the subsurface of urban environments indeed this additional knowledge will help researchers and practitioners to better identify and quantify urban aquifers recharge and alterations so as to improve water balance calculations for the management of the available water resource and to prevent potential negative effects induced by the interaction of leaked water with other anthropogenic features e g flooding of underground spaces like basements and tunnels foundations corrosion excessive hydrostatic stress structures uplift etc moreover it will also allow a better understanding and quantification of the fate of contaminants originating from leaking sewers and other piped networks overall predicting the migration pathways of leaked water can potentially lead to improved monitoring and remedial actions for the management of existing utilities and for the reuse of urban groundwaters for example with this information the location of piezometers and water quality sensors could be optimized to better monitor and interpret pressure and quality alterations within urban aquifers that could help locate and quantify leaks thus enabling faster and more accurate interventions e g pipes repair and rehabilitation soil groundwater treatment and remediation finally the analysis here presented lays the groundwork for future research on the fate of infiltrated stormwater as well indeed the space within the subsurface of urban environments is limited and the interaction between stormwater infiltration facilities and high permeability utility trenches might be inevitable in this case the amount of infiltrated stormwater would be locally high and could follow different infiltration patterns i e intermittent or continuous as a result the urban karst effect induced by high permeability trenches might be more relevant and likely these anthropogenic features will exhibit an alternate intermediate behavior between capillary barriers and sinks depending on stormwater infiltration rates and on the factors shown in this research funding the work of the first author andrea d aniello was financially supported by the fund pon ricerca e
