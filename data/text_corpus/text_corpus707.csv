3535,soil is a major natural resource fundamental for food production and a habitat for living organisms it is therefore extremely important to prevent its erosion it is assumed that 50 of erosion at the global scale is caused by water a relatively low number of studies model soil loss in northern and eastern europe although that region currently contributes to total soil loss the least the projected long term climate change in europe is likely to affect soil loss due to changes in rainfall characteristics this study quantifies historical soil loss rates based on high resolution datasets and assesses the impact of the projected climate change on long term average annual soil erosion rates in poland located in the temperate climate zone using the revised universal soil loss equation rusle model the study investigates the projected changes for two future time horizons namely 2021 2050 near future nf and 2071 2100 far future ff under two different representative concentration pathways rcp 4 5 and 8 5 to account for the uncertainty of individual climate models an ensemble of nine euro cordex model scenarios was used based on the multi model ensemble median the average soil erosion rate in poland for the historical period is 0 48 t ha 1 yr 1 the total annual soil loss in poland is estimated at 14 mt the highest soil loss rate is observed in the south of poland with mean annual erosion rate of 1 7 t ha 1 yr 1 although it occupies only 16 of the territory of poland its share in total soil loss in the country is 62 8 6 mt year 1 the average projected potential soil erosion by water in the future increases gradually reaching 7 rcp4 5 nf 8 rcp8 5 nf 13 rcp4 5 ff and 18 rcp8 5 ff the results of this study might be valuable for the development of the national soil conservation policy the study fills the spatial gap in modelling of changes in soil erosion caused by climate in the northern and eastern part of europe due to the lack of other national studies in the region the directions of such changes could be transferrable to countries in the same climate zones with a similar vegetation cover structure keywords rusle soil erodibility climate models future erosion gis 1 introduction soil is a major natural resource fundamental for food production a habitat for living organisms and a natural store for carbon and water it is considered a conditionally renewable natural resource i e its excess exploitation eventually reaches a level beyond which regeneration becomes impossible it plays a key role in natural ecosystems therefore there is an unquestionable need to assess and prevent its erosion soil erosion can be divided into four major categories regarding its driving force i e wind water freeze thaw and gravity the share of water driven erosion at the global scale is assumed to account for 50 blanco and lal 2008 it can be considered one of the most serious global issues lal 2017 the kinetic energy of raindrops and flowing water can detach soil particles and remove topsoil from the surface of the earth resulting in reduction of soil fertility and its degradation and consequently a serious agricultural productivity decrease borrelli et al 2018 next to soil condition the negative effects of soil erosion can be also severe for water quality hydrological systems habitats and provision of ecosystem services teng et al 2016 soil erosion assessment is essential and poses a great challenge to researchers and managers however in some parts of the world a very limited number of field scale measurements barely contributes to precise quantification of its rates particularly for large regions vrieling et al 2010 because soil erosion is in most cases impractical to be directly measured for large areas soil erosion models are frequently used to assess the soil loss risk at regional and national levels karydas et al 2014 panagos et al 2015d numerous erosional models differing in terms of complexity data requirements and processes included have been developed worldwide karydas et al 2014 among them the revised universal soil loss equation rusle renard et al 1997 is by far the most commonly used karydas et al 2014 panagos et al 2015d teng et al 2018 rusle is an empirical model of soil erosion developed for sheet and rill erosion it has been originally developed for the farm plot scale but it has been reported to be also applicable to other scales country and continental panagos et al 2015d the justification for its use at the country scale presented in this study is as follows i it depends on relatively easily available soil topographic climatic and vegetation datasets at the country scale ii it is integrated with the gis environment permitting processing large input datasets efficiently iii there is an extensive scientific literature allowing for comparison of the outcomes between specific regions in the world iv it permits not only mapping the actual status of soil erosion but also assessment of the scenario based impact of future climate change on erosion rates which is the ultimate objective of this study the primary factors influencing the amount of water driven soil erosion in rusle are soil type precipitation topography land use and land management globally soil erosion by water is assumed to be a common phenomenon occurring in all climatic conditions the spatial distribution of soil erosion in the world points to the most serious threat for large agricultural areas with intense rainfall events east china india mediterranean europe borrelli et al 2020 next to land cover and climate topography steep slopes and high relief is a key driver locally determining high erosion rates soil erosion is considered a global issue that affects most countries and poland is no exception although several rusle catchment scale applications have been conducted in different areas in poland drzewiecki et al 2014 kijowska strugała et al 2018 no country wide quantitative studies are available to date there are two studies presenting qualitative erosion risk maps 5 classes covering poland józefaciuk and józefaciuk 1995 wawer and nowocień 2007 that indicate the share of land surface potentially threatened with water erosion reaching 30 including 17 with erosion intensity varying from average to very strong although the soil erosion risk in poland is relatively low on average local hot spots with increased erosion risk are identified across the country they are mostly found in the southern mountainous and south eastern part of poland where loess areas are part of the large loess belt spreading from ukraine to northern france and belgium because the reported studies józefaciuk and józefaciuk 1995 wawer and nowocień 2007 are qualitative in their nature a model based quantitative assessment of soil erosion rates at the country scale in poland is necessary a large scale sub continental modelling study using rusle for selected european countries covers the territory of poland panagos et al 2015d however the spatial extent of the study nearly the entire continent required the use of input datasets coarser in terms of their resolution and level of detail for efficient calculations our study fills the spatial gap at the national level by using optimised scale adjusted high quality input datasets changes in the historical pattern of precipitation in europe van den besselaar et al 2013 over the period 1951 2010 indicated an increasing trend in total precipitation amount for the northern part of the continent and decreasing for the southern part the study by szwed 2019 examining monthly precipitation totals in observation stations across poland showed a slightly increasing trend for the entire country it is deservedly expected that in the future the extent and magnitude of soil erosion will increase due to an overall increase in extreme rainfall events caused by climate change consequently the projected long term climate change in europe jacob et al 2014 is likely to affect soil loss because of the changes in rainfall characteristics amount spatio temporal distribution and intensity according to the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc synthesis report ipcc 2021 global mean precipitation will increase by almost 4 in the middle of the century 2041 2060 and by 8 by the period 2081 2100 for europe an increase in annual precipitation in central and northern europe up to 30 and a decrease in southern europe up to 40 is projected for the years 2071 2100 jacob et al 2014 according to high resolution projections for poland mezghani et al 2017 precipitation is expected to increase by up to 10 in the period 2021 2050 and by 16 in the period 2071 2100 considering the projected changes it is assumed that rainfall erosivity capability to cause soil loss from hillslopes is of vast importance among natural factors determining soil loss which in contrast to soil characteristics and crop management is not subject to direct human modifications angulo mart inez and begueria 2009 gupta and kumar 2017 in the context of the projected climate change the effect of future changes in rainfall characteristics on soil erosion is believed to be one of the main concerns of soil conservation studies a number of studies from different regions of the world have recently investigated the long term impact of climate change on soil loss using the rusle model driven by various climate forcing data gupta and kumar 2017 teng et al 2018 duulatov et al 2019 guo et al 2019 most of them reported a significant impact of climate change on soil loss rates it is therefore important and justified to quantify that impact in other parts of the world for a better understanding of their region specific environmental consequences the global study by borrelli et al 2020 reported that a climate induced increase in soil erosion rates is likely to be the most intense in tropical and subtropical regions and much less increase is projected for temperate climate regions an extensive study by borrelli et al 2021 reviewed nearly 1 700 articles and identified regions within which erosion models were primarily applied and those that remain unaddressed the study indicated that a relatively low number of studies investigating the impact of climate change on soil loss have been conducted at the regional or national level in northern and eastern europe in regions of the temperate climate zone with a low share of sparsely vegetated areas it is in contrast to extensively investigated central and southern europe although a general tendency indicated in studies by borrelli et al 2021 concerns the cropland areas in central eastern european countries only few studies are available for scandinavian and baltic countries poland latvia lithuania estonia even though globally such regions are assumed to contribute to total soil loss the least panagos et al 2015d it is important to investigate related potential future changes caused by climate change the low erosion rate calculated for those regions is currently a combination of low rainfall erosivity relatively low slopes and high level of vegetation cover however in the context of projected climate change it is important to test future erosion patterns because characteristics of both rainfall erosivity and vegetation cover might change in the future a global study conducted by borrelli et al 2020 indicated that future land use changes impact global soil erosion processes much less than climate change which had been assumed to be a major driver of future increases in soil erosion therefore this study focuses exclusively on the effect of climate change whereas the factors of cover management and conservation practices were considered constant similar to the current situation to provide useful value for policy makers it is recommended to carry out a detailed analysis at the national scale allowing for the estimation of average erosion rates and identification of critical areas extremely susceptible to erosion which might require particular attention now and in the future suri et al 2002 terranova et al 2009 the main objective of this study is to assess the impact of projected climate change on long term average annual soil erosion rates in poland using the rusle model the study investigates projected changes for two future time horizons namely 2021 2050 near future and 2071 2100 far future under two different rcps 4 5 and 8 5 to account for single climate model uncertainties an ensemble of nine euro cordex model scenarios was used jacob et al 2014 as a reference point baseline scenario for the projected climate change historical 1971 2000 bias corrected ensemble of climate models was used this study is particularly important due to the fact that i it concerns a region in europe which still remains poorly investigated borrelli et al 2021 ii it is the first country scale quantitative assessment of the impact of climate change on soil loss in poland iii it uses an ensemble of nine climate models permitting accounting for single model uncertainties iv it uses a 50 meter resolution digital elevation model dem characterised by very high horizontal rmse 0 1 m and vertical rmse 0 2 m accuracy and high resolution sentinel 2 satellite imagery used for cover management factor calculation 2 materials and methods 2 1 research area with a surface area of 312 683 km2 poland ranks among europe s largest countries it is located in central and eastern europe between the baltic sea and the carpathian mountains it is a predominantly lowland country with its largest part belonging to the central european plain and eastern baltic plain according to the regionalisation by kondracki 2002 the mean elevation of poland is 173 m a s l and the maximum is 2 500 m a s l although nearly 75 of the territory has an elevation below 200 m a s l fig 1 b it is worth emphasizing that a significant part of the country is of hilly character due to the activity of glaciers in the pleistocene the elevation gradient increases towards the south poland has highly variable soils characterised by low content of colloids clay minerals and humic substances pastuszak and igras 2012 most of the country is composed of medium to fast permeable soils with a small share of very slow permeable soils fig 1c most soils in poland were formed after the latest vistulian glaciation formations from earlier glaciations were covered with interglacial and holocene alluvial deposits bedrocks of the majority of soils in poland are various types of pleistocene post glacial deposits in upland and mountainous part of poland bedrocks of contemporary soils are made of formations from earlier geological periods mostly mesozoic high mountains are built from solid magmatic and metamorphic formations whereas low mountains were formed from deposit flysch structures bednarek et al 2004 considering the granulometric composition of bedrocks soils in poland are mostly made up of gravels and sands 46 soils built of clays cover approximately 26 of the country and soils made up of silts nearly 8 the remaining 20 are soils formed from alluvial deposits organogenic structures and carbonate rocks poland features temperate climate with cold winters and warm summers the geographical location of the country and its landform features are the two most important factors determining its climate it is generally influenced by maritime air from the north west cold polar air from russia and scandinavia and subtropical air from the atlantic ocean and the mediterranean sea the highest annual precipitation above 1 000 mm is observed in the mountainous area and the lowest 400 500 mm in the lowland parts fig 1d the average annual precipitation total for poland is 600 mm at the annual scale precipitation in summer is considerably higher compared to winter with an average annual share of 63 and 37 for summer and winter respectively the average number of days with precipitation occurrence greater than 1 mm for poland is 109 days ranging from 94 days in the central to 138 days in the southern part of the country kundzewicz et al 2017 land cover fig 1a in poland predominantly includes agriculture 63 and forests 32 clc2018 agriculture in poland is characterised by high disintegration into a large number of small farms 8 6 ha on average and their unfavorable surface structure czyżewski and brelik 2014 76 of agricultural areas is arable land more prone to erosion and 24 are meadows and pastures soil conservation practices in poland are not very popular and a negligible increase in their application during last decades was noted rogalski and jabłoński 1983 wiśniewski 2014 in poland sheet and rill erosion dominate over gully erosion with their respective share of 82 and 18 józefaciuk and józefaciuk 1992 regarding the spatial distribution of gully erosion it most commonly occurs in the southern part of the country and only sporadically in central poland 2 2 climate change projections this paper is based on climate forcing data at a 5 km resolution from the chase pl climate projections mezghani et al 2017 consisting of nine bias corrected gcm rcm runs involving four different gcms and rcms elaborated within the euro cordex initiative covering projections by 2100 under two emission scenarios rcp4 5 and 8 5 systematic biases in euro cordex rcm runs over poland have been observed that required adjustments therefore a quantile mapping method was applied as a bias correction procedure to reduce systematic bias in climate models gudmundsson et al 2012 the gridded daily precipitation and temperature dataset cplfd gdpt5 was used as reference data in the bias adjustment procedure berezowski et al 2016 the reference dataset covering the entire territory of poland consisted of a 5 km 5 km gridded product of daily precipitation for the period 1951 2013 the quantile mapping of the simulated time series to the observed ones was performed for each grid cell for each of the four seasons separately to take into account the seasonality in the biases quantiles of simulations for the control period 1971 2000 were overlaid with quantiles in the reference data observations transfer functions were then used to correct for the bias in daily precipitation in nine climate model simulations bias corrected historical simulations were evaluated in terms of their ability to reproduce statistical properties of the reference observed dataset for each grid cell a rmse was calculated as a measure of the model s performance annual and seasonal the rmse in precipitation annual means averaged over nine climate models ensemble mean was 15 5 4 4 mm month 1 bias corrected precipitation values covered three time slices 1971 2000 historical period 2021 2050 near future nf and 2071 2100 far future ff according to the projections mezghani et al 2017 precipitation in poland is expected to increase projections for two emission scenarios generally show similar changes for nf a stronger increase is projected for the rcp8 5 scenario for the ff horizon assuming rcp4 5 an increase in average annual mean precipitation by 6 is expected to occur for nf and 10 for ff in seasonal terms the highest increase is expected in winter 8 for nf and 18 for ff and spring 8 for nf and 15 for ff and the lowest in summer 4 for both future time horizons and autumn 7 for both future time horizons regarding the rcp8 5 scenario the expected change for ff is approximately 16 for the annual mean precipitation 27 for winter and spring 5 for summer and 13 for autumn the spatial distribution of precipitation changes ensemble median over poland for all scenarios is presented in fig 2 2 3 rusle model this study applied a modified version of the rusle model renard et al 1997 it integrates six factors related to rainfall erosivity r factor soil erodibility k factor slope length and steepness factor ls factor cover management c factor and conservation practices p factor rusle calculates mean annual soil erosion rates according to the following equation e r k l s c p where e annual average soil loss t ha 1 yr 1 r rainfall erosivity factor mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 k soil erodibility factor t ha h ha 1 mj 1 mm 1 ls slope length and steepness factor c cover management factor and p conservation practices factor 2 3 1 rainfall erosivity r factor rainfall variability in space and time across the investigated area has a considerable effect on the distribution and intensity of soil erosion rainfall erosivity is calculated as a sum of rain kinetic energy and its maximum 30 min intensity however such a detailed pluviographic data is rarely available to overcome this limitation renard and freimund 1994 proposed the use of the modified fournier index arnoldus 1977 for calculating the r factor in regions where long term rainfall intensity data is unavailable mfi i 1 12 p i 2 p t where mfi modified fournier index pi monthly precipitation total in i th month mm pt annual total precipitation mm according to licznar 2004 the applicability of monthly rainfall data to estimate the annual erosivity rainfall factor in poland by using mfi can be expressed by the following equation r 0 226 mfi 1 2876 where r rainfall erosivity factor mj cm ha 1h 1 yr 1 using the 5 km gridded daily precipitation data covering the polish territory the r factor was calculated for each grid cell for the historical period baseline and each emission horizon scenario combination i e rcp4 5 nf rcp4 5 ff rcp8 5 nf rcp8 5 ff in each scenario for every grid cell daily precipitation was aggregated to monthly and yearly sums and the r factor was calculated on the annual basis for all time slices 1971 2000 2021 2050 2071 2100 afterwards thirty year averages of annual rainfall erosivity factor for each time slice and emission scenario was calculated and used in the rusle equation 2 3 2 soil erodibility k factor soil erodibility is defined as a measure of the susceptibility of soil particles to detachment related to the soil structure texture permeability and soil organic matter content in this study k factor values were assigned to a particular soil type based on its texture from the agricultural soil map of poland the soil map in vector format has a resolution of 1 100 000 covers the entire area of the country and stores information on soil texture in each polygon the average area of the uniform soil texture polygon is 1 2 km2 k factor values for different types of soil in poland were derived from the extensive research of the institute of soil science and plant cultivation in puławy wawer et al 2005 stuczyński et al 2010 and other studies conducted in poland drzewiecki et al 2014 2 3 3 slope length and steepness ls factor slope length and steepness describes the effect of topography on soil erosion it represents the product of slope length l and slope steepness s it can be directly measured in the field or derived from dem in this study it was estimated by using the hydrology module available in system for automated geoscientific analyses saga the ls factor field base which incorporates the multiple flow algorithm pilesjö and hasan 2014 a 50 meter resolution dem acquired from the head office of geodesy and cartography in poland characterised by very high horizontal rmse 0 1 m and vertical rmse 0 2 m accuracy fig 1b obtained via light detection and ranging lidar method was used to calculate the slope and catchment area freeman 1991 2 3 4 cover management c factor the cover management factor c is one of the most important measures for assessing the risk of soil erosion it is described as a soil loss ratio of a given plot of land cover to a bare plot ploughed up and down along the slope gradient ayalew et al 2020 soil loss rates are influenced by the stage of vegetation development as well as the type of crops or applied agrotechnical practices panagos et al 2015b and are typically measured several times per year from seedbed preparation to harvesting at different phenological stages of a given crop on a regional to national scale however the c factor values for particular types of land cover are primarily estimated by assigning uniform empirical values from literature it should be emphasized that it does not accurately reflect the actual spatio temporal variability of the vegetation cover which in turn entails inaccuracy in the estimation of the c values to improve the accuracy and reliability of c factor estimation remotely sensed images for generating c factor maps based on vegetation indices such as the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi are commonly used ayalew et al 2020 van der knijff et al 2000 in this study because of the size of the analysed area and the complexity of land cover satellite remote sensing was used to estimate the c factor the study utilises level 1c data from the multispectral instrument msi of sentinel 2a satellite acquired from earthexplorer platform for the growing season of 2020 the msi acquires 13 spectral bands ranging from visible and near infrared vnir to shortwave infrared swir wavelengths table 1 satellite data processing included atmospheric and geometric correction as well as cloud masking sen2cor processor was used to correct sentinel 2a level 1c data product from the effects of the atmosphere in order to deliver surface reflectance data further data processing was performed in envi 5 3 esri arcgis 10 5 and gdal 3 0 4 the remote sensing method of c factor determination was based on the spectral vegetation index ndvi using exponential regression c van der knijff et al 2000 ndvi nir r e d nir r e d where nir is the surface spectral reflectance in the near infrared band band 8 of msi data see table 1 and red is the surface spectral reflectance in the red band band 4 c e x p α ndvi β n d v i where α and β are parameters related to the shape of the curve that associates ndvi with the c factor the values of 2 and 1 were used as the best representatives for european climate conditions of equation parameters α and β respectively according to van der knijff et al 2000 the ndvi value in van der knijff equation was calculated as a mean value of ndvi for all periods when erosion is active from april to september kulimushi et al 2021a 2 3 5 conservation practices p factor the conservation practices p factor imitates the impact of support practices reducing the rate of average annual soil loss it is described as the ratio between soil erosion on a field with support practices carried on to the loss on the same field with no support practices applied in this study the p factor for poland was derived from the map for europe developed by panagos et al 2015c 2 3 6 data processing and soil erosion calculation input maps in raster format were resampled r and p factor and aggregated k and c factor to a reference resolution of dem 50 m before multiplication soil loss was estimated for 94 of the country area because surfaces not prone to soil erosion i e bare rocks urban areas surface water bodies wetlands cover 6 of the area of poland annual soil erosion maps for poland at a resolution of 50 m were calculated by integrating constant values of k ls c and p factors and variant climate scenario derived r factors 45 in total although c factor is dynamic in short term according to borrelli et al 2020 future land use changes impact global soil erosion processes much less than climate change which had been assumed to be a major driver of future increases in soil erosion a similar approach has been proposed in other studies investigating the impact of climate change on soil erosion gupta and kumar 2017 chakrabortty et al 2020 hateffard et al 2021 regarding the p factor according to panagos et al 2015c the average p factor value for poland is 0 9781 considering very low popularity of conservation practices in poland and negligible increase in their application over the recent decades rogalski and jabłoński 1983 wiśniewski 2014 it was kept constant in future time horizons moreover keeping the p factor constant in future scenarios could be informative for decision makers on how the erosion rates change when current soil conservation policy is maintained nine maps were created for the historical period which served as a reference baseline scenario describing current conditions for future scenarios nine maps were derived for each combination of rcp 4 5 and 8 5 and time horizon nf and ff providing four sub sets with overall number of 36 soil loss maps four times nine climate models to describe average conditions for poland for each of the model input datasets and output soil loss maps spatial mean values raster data statistics mean were calculated in order to describe extreme low and high conditions 10th and 90th percentiles raster data statistics percentile were estimated the calculated statistics concerning the r factor and output soil loss maps were presented in box plots to indicate the variability of individual climate models in five sub sets one historical and four future scenarios for the interpretation of r factor maps and the resulting soil erosion maps to account for the individual climate model uncertainty pixel wise ensemble median values from nine maps were calculated for each sub set historical rcp4 5 nf rcp4 5 ff rcp8 5 nf rcp8 5 ff the methodological flowchart of the analysis is presented in fig 3 3 results 3 1 input factors of rusle model multi annual average rainfall erosivity for poland was calculated separately for nine climate models for the historical period 1971 2000 and two future time horizons 2021 2050 2071 2100 under rcp4 5 and 8 5 fig 4 while the spatial distribution of the r factor varies between climate models for the historical period a general agreement on the decreasing gradient from the southern mountainous region to the central lowland part of the country is observed for the climate models ensemble all climate models also reflect the influence of the baltic sea in the northern part of the country where the r factor increases locally compared to the central part of poland average rainfall erosivity conditions for poland calculated as spatial mean for the entire country vary between climate models ensemble median of the mean r factor for poland is 588 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 ranging between 543 and 609 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 fig 5 a climate models ensemble median of the 10th percentile r factor for poland is 504 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 ranging between 462 and 526 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 fig 5b and the 90th percentile is 693 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 640 715 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 fig 5c rainfall erosivity projections for future time horizons regardless of the rcp seem to maintain the spatial distribution across poland observed in the historical period characterised by a decreasing gradient from south to north locally increasing in the seaside region fig 4 however significant differences in the magnitude of change can be observed not only between the climate models but particularly between time horizons and rcps the increase generally intensifies with time horizon and rcp scenario reaching the highest values for rcp8 5 ff fig 5 a significantly lower increase in rainfall erosivity is observed for rcp4 5 nf in the comparison of the single impact of the rcp scenario and time horizon the latter seems to influence the r factor more intensely fig 5a shows changes in average conditions of rainfall erosivity for poland driven by climate change projections the multi model ensemble median of mean r factor values across poland constantly increases from 627 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 in rcp4 5 nf reaching 688 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 for rcp8 5 ff a similar trend is observed for extreme rainfall erosivity conditions fig 5b and c the multi model ensemble median for 10th percentile reaches maximum values for rcp8 5 ff 584 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 and for 90th percentile 810 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 in order to present the spatial distribution of change in rainfall erosivity across poland driven by climate change an absolute difference between each projected scenario and climate models baseline historical period is shown in fig 6 positive values indicate an increase and negative a decrease in the r factor although on average an increase in the r factor is expected to occur in poland according to the multi model ensemble fig 5 certain climate models indicate a local decrease in rainfall erosivity fig 6 the spatial distribution of r factor change is generally highly variable between individual climate models and no clear pattern is observed the spatial distribution of the k factor fig 7 a was obtained by ascribing each soil texture with a respective k value from the agricultural soil map according to the literature of wawer et al 2005 stuczyński et al 2010 and drzewiecki et al 2014 the k values ranged from 0 003 t ha h ha 1 mj 1 mm 1 for soils with high organic matter content to 0 05 t ha h ha 1 mj 1 mm 1 for loamy very fine sands the mean k factor for poland was estimated at 0 016 t ha h ha 1 mj 1 mm 1 with a standard deviation of 0 009 t ha h ha 1 mj 1 mm 1 according to the map 80 of the country is covered by soils with k factor 0 02 t ha h ha 1 mj 1 mm 1 indicating a low erodible class the most erodible soils k values in a range from 0 03 to 0 05 t ha h ha 1 mj 1 mm 1 were mostly found in the southern and south eastern part of poland where loess areas are part of the large loess belt spreading from ukraine to northern france and belgium the analysis revealed the mean ls factor value for poland of 0 47 with a standard deviation of 1 42 fig 7b the lowest value ls factor occurred in the central part of poland while the highest value occurred in the south fig 7b shows that high ls values were consistent with high topography and coincided with mountain scarps that rendered these areas extremely susceptible to erosion the spatial distribution of c factor values is presented in fig 7c in poland the highest share of territory is occupied by agricultural areas 63 for which the mean c factor value was estimated at 0 08 significantly lower values 0 003 were estimated for forests which cover approximately 32 of poland the highest c factor values were assigned to bare lands and sparsely vegetated areas 0 22 which occupy merely 0 02 of the territory the average c factor value for poland was estimated as 0 08 according to panagos et al 2015c who estimated the p factor at the european level the mean value for poland was 0 9781 fig 7d due to the limited application of contour farming in the country the spatial distribution of the p factor is presented in fig 7d 3 2 historical soil erosion rates before the impact of the projected climate change on soil erosion can be estimated it is crucial to determine the reliable reference conditions so called baseline scenario of soil loss in poland for the historical period the climate model ensemble median of the areal mean annual rate of soil loss due to water erosion for the historical period in poland is 0 48 t ha 1 yr 1 the multi model ensemble median for areal 10th percentile of soil erosion rate is 0 009 t ha 1 yr 1 and for 90th percentile 1 05 t ha 1 yr 1 the total annual soil loss of poland is estimated at 14 mt the highest soil loss rate is found in the south of poland due to the combination of high rainfall erosivity and topography mountainous region and in the south eastern part of the country mostly due to the presence of highly erosive loess soils and topography highlands region the mean annual erosion rate for this vulnerable region of poland is 1 7 t ha 1 yr 1 it should be emphasised that although it occupies only 16 of the territory of poland its share of the total soil loss in poland is 62 8 6 mt year 1 the central lowland part of the country with the lowest annual precipitation total is mostly characterised by a low soil loss rate 0 1 t ha 1 yr 1 and the northern part by moderate erosion 0 3 t ha 1 yr 1 fig 8 3 3 projected future soil loss potential average annual soil loss was predicted with respect to the change in rainfall erosivity while the other factors were kept constant fig 9 shows multi model ensemble box plots presenting calculated grid based statistics mean 10th and 90th percentile for poland for each combination of rcp time horizon compared to the historical period all grid based statistics increase in future projections and the increase gradually intensifies with rcp and time horizon in rcp4 5 the multi model ensemble median of annual mean soil loss for poland was 0 50 t ha 1 yr 1 for nf and 0 53 t ha 1 yr 1 for ff in rcp8 5 the corresponding values were 0 51 t ha 1 yr 1 and 0 55 t ha 1 yr 1 the remaining grid based statistics for poland according to the multi model ensemble median increase as well reaching the highest annual soil loss rates for rcp8 5 0 0104 t ha 1 yr 1 grid based 10th percentile and 1 20 t ha 1 yr 1 grid based 90th percentile fig 9 to extend the perspective of climate driven increase in soil loss rates an absolute and relative change future projection compared to historical period was calculated for each climate model in fig 10 grid based statistics mean and 90th percentile were performed within the country borders for each combination of climate model rcp time horizon and presented in box plots in rcp4 5 nf the multi model ensemble median of annual average soil loss change indicated an absolute increase by 0 02 t ha 1 yr 1 corresponding with a relative increase by 7 for the remaining rcp time horizon combinations the following changes were observed 0 03 t ha 1 yr 1 8 rcp8 5 nf 0 058 t ha 1 yr 1 13 rcp4 5 ff and 0 08 t ha 1 yr 1 18 rcp8 5 ff for 90th percentile statistics for poland the projected changes were more intense in rcp4 5 nf the multi model ensemble median of 90th percentile soil loss change indicated an absolute increase by 0 05 t ha 1 yr 1 giving a relative increase by 13 for the remaining rcp time horizon combinations the following changes were observed 0 08 t ha 1 yr 1 15 5 rcp8 5 nf 0 12 t ha 1 yr 1 18 rcp4 5 nf and 0 17 t ha 1 yr 1 27 rcp8 5 ff it should be emphasised that although the projected absolute rates of soil erosion increase are relatively low the relative increase is rather high particularly for rcp8 5 ff in fig 11 gridded maps of average annual soil erosion consisting of multi model ensemble median values for each pixel were presented for each rcp time horizon combination the spatial distribution of soil erosion projections across poland generally seems to remain similar to that for the historical period it is worth emphasizing that the share of an area with soil loss rate greater than 1 t ha 1 yr 1 compared to the historical period 9 9 increases gradually reaching 10 3 rcp4 5 nf 10 9 rcp4 5 ff 10 6 rcp8 5 nf and 11 2 rcp8 5 ff which corresponds to 32 052 km2 33 664 km2 32 874 km2 and 34 826 km2 of the country s surface area respectively the total annual soil loss of poland compared to historical 14 mt yr 1 in future projections increases to approximately 14 6 mt yr 1 15 4 mt yr 1 15 1 mt yr 1 and 16 mt yr 1 for rcp4 5 nf rcp4 5 ff rcp8 5 nf and rcp8 5 ff respectively for the most vulnerable regions in southern poland a significant increase in soil erosion rate is expected for rcp8 5 ff 2 1 t ha 1 yr 1 for the remaining climate scenarios the increase is less intensive reaching 1 8 t ha 1 yr 1 1 9 t ha 1 yr 1 and 1 9 t ha 1 yr 1 for rcp4 5 nf rcp4 5 ff and rcp8 5 nf respectively because changes in the magnitude of soil loss between the projections are hard to detect due to the high resolution of maps presented in fig 11 additional maps of relative change future projection compared to historical period in soil loss rates for each of the climate models are presented in fig 12 the diversity of spatial distribution of soil loss relative change regarding the climate models is very high for all scenarios rcps and time horizons although the average values for poland indicated a general increase in soil loss rates maps for individual climate models show patches with a slight decrease up to 15 in the comparison of the scenarios it mostly occurs in nf and is barely noticed in ff where values of relative increase of soil loss locally reach 70 the obviously patchy pattern of soil loss relative change for individual climate models follows the pattern of projected rainfall erosivity across poland 4 discussion 4 1 rusle factors most studies on rainfall erosivity in poland to date have been conducted at a local to regional level using either high temporal resolution 30 min banasik et al 2001 baryła 2004 święchowicz 2013 or coarse resolution daily drzewiecki et al 2014 kijowska strugała et al 2018 precipitation datasets none of the previous studies however has covered the entire country panagos et al 2015a calculated the r factor for 29 european countries based on high temporal resolution precipitation datasets 60 min and reported mean value for poland equal to 537 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 in the reference study however the network of high resolution monitoring stations in poland was reported to be sparse nine stations covering the period 1961 1988 and unevenly distributed across the country stations concentrated in the eastern part which could affect the accuracy of the spatial distribution of rainfall erosivity across poland as presented the r factor for poland based on the mfi used in this study is slightly higher climate models ensemble median 588 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 and represents different spatial distribution it is worth emphasising however that the r factor distribution based on mfi follows the actual rainfall distribution in poland cf fig 1d and 4 most studies on the k factor reported in poland have been carried out at a local level wawer et al 2005 święchowicz 2010 panagos et al 2014a calculated the k factor with a resolution of 500 m at the european level including the entire area of poland in the reference study the mean k factor for poland was reported as 0 029 t ha h ha 1 mj 1 mm 1 which is around 80 higher compared to our results the use of a fine resolution 1 100 000 soil agricultural map in our study improves the spatial distribution of soil types to which the k factor was assigned to assess the obtained results of the spatial distribution of the c factor the statistics within corine land cover classes from 2018 were calculated and then compared with values obtained by other researchers table 2 moreover such comparison was also important because some authors reported problems due to the sensitivity of the ndvi derived c factor values to several biophysical parameters such as vitality and density of the vegetation cover soil background differences and variations in topographic features ayalew et al 2020 matsushita et al 2007 the range of possible values for the c factor presented in table 2 was obtained from panagos et al 2015b who developed them based on the most cited studies covering different countries in europe it is worth emphasising that c factor values obtained in this study fall within the most frequently reported land cover specific values table 2 the impact of individual rusle factors on the estimated soil loss is diverse and strongly depends on environmental and management settings although precipitation is the primary driving force of soil erosion it has been proved that the r factor is not perfectly correlated with soil loss wang et al 2018 kulimushi et al 2021a this stresses the crucial impact of the remaining factors for instance ma et al 2012 and kulimushi et al 2021b reported the ls factor to be key contributor to soil loss in highland and mountainous regions characterised by steep slopes tetzlaff and wendland 2012 applied usle type soil erosion model to medium sized watershed in germany with heterogeneous landscape and topography they indicated that beside ls the k factor has the highest impact on soil erosion potential because the identified risk areas in the watershed strongly correlated with loess soils distribution tetzlaff and wendland 2012 also reported very low soil losses for plain lands with high vegetation coverage pointing to the importance of the c factor in the region on the other hand ma et al 2012 reported that even in the hilly and mountainous region in china with high ls factor values an increase in vegetation cover and optimised land use structure as a result of human activities might reduce the erosion risk this study covered the entire territory of poland highly diverse in terms of topology soil distribution rainfall intensity and land use types for details see section 2 1 therefore the influence of rusle factors on soil erosion is region specific for instance in the southern mountainous part of poland characterized by the highest slopes and precipitation totals the ls and p factors are of key importance in determining high erosion rates which is in line with the findings of ma et al 2012 and kulimushi et al 2021b for mountainous regions in other parts of the world like in results presented by tetzlaff and wendland 2012 we found that erosion risk areas are closely correlated with loess soils distribution prevailing in southern and south eastern poland in the central part of poland characterised by lowland relief and low erodible soils the risk of erosion is very low considering the c factor map for poland the spatial variability of soil erosion seems to highly coincide with land use as was also observed by fu et al 2009 and kulimushi et al 2021b in other parts of the world large areas of poland are characterised by low erosion due to the presence of forests covering approximately 31 of the country because the significance of the c factor in determining the distribution of soil erosion rate is well known there is a number of studies finding the c factor to be defined dynamic in time borrelli et al 2020 kulimushi et al 2021b such an approach is particularly important for regions undergoing substantial changes in land use for instance due to deforestation kulimushi et al 2021b according to mierzwiak and całka 2019 who analysed clc maps of poland from 1990 to 2012 the area of land cover changes in poland during that period was very small and it did not exceeded 1 of the country s territory therefore in this study the c factor map was kept constant for future scenarios moreover considering very low popularity of conservation practices in poland and a negligible increase in their application over the recent decades rogalski and jabłoński 1983 wiśniewski 2014 the p factor was kept constant in future time horizons a similar approach is found in other studies focused on the projected impact of climate change on soil erosion chapman et al 2021 hateffard et al 2021 4 2 historical soil loss as baseline scenario before the estimation of the impact of the projected climate change on soil erosion it is crucial to have reliable reference conditions so called baseline scenario of soil loss in poland for the historical period the assessment of the accuracy of the historical soil loss rate involved comparison of our results at 50 m resolution with other european scale studies namely 100 m resolution rusle2015 panagos et al 2015d 1 km resolution eionet soil panagos et al 2014b and 1 km resolution pesera kirkby et al 2008 it is worth emphasising that pesera and eionet soil products differ not only in terms of resolution but also modelling approaches and input datasets rusle2015 differs in terms of resolution and estimation methods for particular factors r k and c but the general approach is similar as that in our study despite the differences all the products have been extensively used in europe and their direct comparison appears justified for each of the models an areal mean soil loss rate for poland has been calculated and the rates are as follows rusle2015 0 96 t ha 1 yr 1 pesera 0 83 t ha 1 yr 1 and eionet soil 1 46 t ha 1 yr 1 compared to our results 0 48 t ha 1 yr 1 all three models indicated higher soil loss rates high compliance however occured in the spatial distribution of soil erosion in all models several studies are available in poland that simulate soil erosion using the rusle model drzewiecki et al 2014 calculated soil loss for the małopolska voivodeship southern poland and reported an average soil loss rate of 3 8 t ha 1 yr 1 which is higher than our estimations for that region 2 9 t ha 1 yr 1 according to the analysis of single components of the rusle equation the difference was mainly caused by the r and c factor the period for which drzewiecki et al 2014 applied the rusle model was characterised by higher precipitation moreover they estimated the c factor based on literature in contrast to our ndvi approach our results suggest that in the historical context poland is not highly ranked regarding soil erosion rates in comparison to other european countries considering the reported average soil loss rates for 29 countries panagos et al 2015d poland is placed in the 1st quartile 0 51 t ha 1 yr 1 lower erosion was reported in scandinavian countries sweden finland and baltic countries estonia latvia and significantly higher in mediterranean countries italy greece malta the share of poland s contribution in the total soil loss in the european union was estimated for 1 5 according to jones et al 2004 the tolerated threshold for soil erosion is 1 t ha 1 yr 1 which is considered to be sustainable given the soil formation rates in the historical period in poland based on the multi model ensemble median annual average soil loss grid fig 8 the share of an area with soil loss rate greater than 1 t ha 1 yr 1 accounts for 9 9 30 564 km2 historical studies józefaciuk and józefaciuk 1995 wawer and nowocień 2007 assessed the share of land surface potentially threatened with water erosion in poland for a total of 30 the qualitative nature of the latter studies however did not relate the risk classes to any particular erosion rates and therefore quantitative comparison of our results with these studies is difficult it needs to be emphasised that spatial distribution in all three maps is characterised with high similarity and consistency especially in the case of mapping high erosion risk areas following the threshold proposed by jones et al 2004 of 1 t ha 1 yr 1 for tolerable soil loss we postulate that the actual share of land surface potentially threatened with water erosion in poland is 9 9 it should be emphasised that our study on soil loss in poland does not challenge the reference studies its intention was to use the most recent high quality input datasets to refine the soil loss rates at a national scale studies at the regional local level in poland drzewiecki et al 2014 święchowicz 2010 and at the european scale panagos et al 2015d are currently available our study fills the spatial gap at the national level using optimised scale adjusted high quality input datasets the major input layers increasing the accuracy of soil loss rates used in this study are as follows 1 50 meter resolution dem characterised by very high horizontal rmse 0 1 m and vertical rmse 0 2 m accuracy 2 high resolution 50 meter soil erodibility map and 3 sentinel 2 satellite imagery derived c factor the resulting map of soil loss rates constitutes a compromise between input data quality resolution and computational capabilities at the national scale 4 3 climate change driven soil loss changes no studies on climate induced changes of rainfall erosivity strongly determining soil loss have been reported at a regional or national scale in the territory of poland to date panagos et al 2017 estimated future rainfall erosivity in europe based on hadgem2 climate model projections for rcp4 5 and the time frame of 2041 2060 it closely corresponds to the scenario rcp4 5 nf presented in this study allowing for a simple comparison of the results according to panagos et al 2017 mean r factor for the projected future scenario for poland was 814 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 whereas in this study mean value for poland expressed as a multi model ensemble median for rcp4 5 nf scenario was 627 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 which is notably lower regardless of the magnitude the direction of change is consistent in both studies a clear advancement of our study is the use of multi model ensemble projections dealing with uncertainty regarding future climate change of a single model parker 2013 as presented here the future relative increase in soil loss for poland might reach up to 18 on average it should be emphasized however that it corresponds to an absolute increase by 0 08 t ha 1 yr 1 assumed to be a relatively low increase at the national scale considering the regional context a much higher increase up to 24 0 4 t ha 1 yr 1 is observed in the southern part of the country dominated by highly erosive loess soils and steep slopes the vulnerability of that region in poland to soil erosion has been reported in historical studies józefaciuk and józefaciuk 1995 wawer and nowocień 2007 and quantified in this study baseline scenario in future scenarios total annual soil loss for that particular region occupying 16 of the polish territory constantly increases reaching up to 9 7 mt corresponding with 62 of total soil loss for the entire country the projected increase in soil erosion for southern poland was calculated using constant p factor i e no change in conservation practices to indicate to environmental managers what could possibly happen if current conservation measures are maintained if no additional actions are taken in the context of climate change soil loss in the region may intensify the study quantitatively presents that the majority of soil loss in poland is concentrated in a relatively small territory this clearly shows where soil conservation policy and measures should be focused to reduce the erosion risk the most efficiently worldwide applications of the impact of climate change on soil loss from different regions and climate zones using models from the 5th phase of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 reported that future changes in precipitation values will highly affect soil erosion by water teng et al 2018 hateffard et al 2021 girmay et al 2021 consistently with our results regardless of the climatic zone in the reference studies the highest increase is projected under rcp8 5 reported by borrelli et al 2020 to provide the basis for soil conservation planning in that study borrelli et al 2020 conducted for the entire globe the projected soil loss for poland by 2070 under rcp8 5 was contrary to our findings negligible 0 5 it might be a result of the scale of the analysis and consequently the degree of detail of input datasets the use of much coarser gcm climate data and combined effect of climate and land use change investigated in the study by borrelli et al 2020 as presented in our study employing high resolution datasets and downscaled rcm ensemble the potential changes of future soil loss for poland following rcp8 5 are more pronounced averaging up to 18 this coincides with previous studies suggesting a direct correlation of precipitation amounts with soil erosion darwish et al 2016 doulabian et al 2021 at the european level panagos et al 2021 investigated the impact of climate change on future rates of soil erosion by water in 2050 within agricultural areas for poland a 20 increase in soil loss was projected under rcp8 5 it can be compared with our results for rcp8 5 nf pointing to an increase by 10 6 there is therefore a general agreement on the future direction of change in soil erosion in poland but the magnitude of the increase differs between the studies the differences appear to be caused by the use of different ensembles of climate models gcm vs gcm rcm as the projected increase in rainfall erosivity differs significantly between the studies the relative change projected for europe by panagos et al 2021 reaches 36 9 rcp8 5 which is significantly higher than that for the euro cordex ensemble used in our study for poland 10 the difference might also be caused by the fact that in contrast to our study panagos et al 2021 estimated the combined effect of climate and land use change on soil loss the national scale of this study allows for the determination of hot spot areas vulnerable to soil loss in future time horizons and planning of soil conservation actions preventing future erosion caused by rainfall changes the study fills the spatial gap in modelling the impact of climate change on soil erosion in this part of europe and the temperate climate zone borrelli et al 2021 future national applications could benefit from the presented study s data sources and calculation scheme especially that euro cordex covers the entire european continent although some general directions of climate change driven soil loss change in the future could be transferred from our study to other countries with similar land cover structure and climate characteristics detailed applications for other parts of europe are still needed borrelli et al 2021 4 4 practical implementation from the hydrological perspective the projected future increase in soil erosion over poland may have a wide range of consequences affecting water quality reservoirs operation flood risk sedimentation and waterways clogging issaka and ashraf 2017 morris 2020 olorunfemi et al 2020 posthumus et al 2015 given that erosion is a process that involves an increase in surface runoff which in turn accelerates phosphorus loss from the soil carpenter and bennett 2011 there is a potential threat of excessive eutrophication of water particularly in areas of high erosion risk southern poland smoroń 2012 investigated the risk of surface water eutrophication in loess uplands in southern poland and reported high total phosphorus concentrations as a result of soil erosion by water the projected increase in the soil erosion rate in the southern region of poland could potentially intensify the eutrophication of inland waters madeyski et al 2008 reported high silting of reservoirs in southern poland with the rate of silting greatly exceeding the mean value for poland they reported agricultural areas to be the primary contributors to sediment erosion that decreases the reservoir s capacity through silting the projected future increase in soil loss might accelerate the rate of further silting potentially strongly increasing the flood risk and consequently leading to infrastructure failure in the southern mountainous area of poland the results reported at the national scale can provide the basis for the identification of erosion hot spots and for policy decision making regarding disaster prevention and conservation measures 4 5 study uncertainties climate change impact studies are burdened with numerous uncertainties that can be classified as intrinsic and knowledge related toimil et al 2020 intrinsic uncertainty irreducible in its nature giorgi 2010 is related to emission scenarios and the internal variability of the climate system knowledge uncertainty results from the imperfect knowledge of earth s physical processes comprising climate model projections bias correction and downscaling methods and impact models the highest uncertainty in climate change impact studies is primarily attributed to climate model outputs chen et al 2011 to minimise it it is broadly recommended to use gcm rcm ensembles teutschbein and seibert 2010 eekhout and de vente 2019 therefore in this study an ensemble of nine climate models gcm rcm combinations was included to account for differences in projected changes in soil loss in soil erosion assessment studies a particular uncertainty was attributed to downscaling and bias correction methods li and fang 2016 it is due to the fact that soil erosion is found to be more sensitive to changes in rainfall intensity than precipitation total nunes et al 2009 and not all bias correction methods are able to account for such changes it has been reported that in contrast to the delta change method déqué 2007 quantile mapping wood et al 2004 is able to transfer projected changes in rainfall intensity from gcm to soil erosion model input paroissien et al 2015 kourgialas et al 2016 therefore in this study we used a climate model dataset corrected using the quantile mapping method to reduce systematic bias in climate models gudmundsson et al 2012 and reflect changes in rainfall intensity in the future which is more suited to soil erosion assessment another source of knowledge uncertainty is related to the impact model recent studies have continued to question the use of empirical models such as rusle to evaluate erosion rates emphasising the advantage of more field based assessment of water erosion over the modelling approach evans 2013 it is obvious that modelling cannot be an alternative to field measurement and on site monitoring nonetheless it becomes crucial and necessary when it comes to large scale evaluations especially when no field data are available panagos et al 2016 the rusle model is also often contested and criticised due to the fact that most equations have been developed based on plot scale experiments in the usa however it was also proved that careful consideration and adaptation of the model parameters to site or region specific conditions ensures reliable soil loss estimations alewell et al 2019 it is generally agreed that models should be validated with measured data for usle type models applied at a large scale however such validation is limited by the absence of field measurements covering the area of interest recent studies have confirmed that accurate parametrisation reduces the uncertainty of usle type modelling meusburger et al 2013 yue et al 2016 moreover some authors suggest that a cross comparison of modelling results with available studies can provide insights on the plausibility of modelling predictions borrelli et al 2020 hence to obtain reliable soil loss estimation for poland using rusle high resolution input data were collected and processed and the final results were compared to other studies covering the polish territory 5 conclusions this study describes historical and future projected soil loss rates in poland using the latest high resolution datasets and the rusle model in order to compensate for the uncertainty among the different climate models an ensemble of nine euro cordex model scenarios under rcp4 5 and 8 5 were used for the historical period 1971 2000 and two future time horizons 2021 2050 2071 2100 a 50 meter resolution soil loss map was produced for each scenario based on the multi model ensemble median the average soil erosion rate in poland for the historical period is 0 48 t ha 1 yr 1 and the share of an area with soil loss rate greater than 1 t ha 1 yr 1 considered to be the threshold tolerated for soil erosion accounts for 9 9 of poland s territory total annual soil loss for poland is estimated at 14 mt due to change in rainfall intensity and spatio temporal distribution caused by climate change future predictions of soil erosion point to an overall increase in soil loss the projected increase differs among the scenarios and appears to be more influenced by the time horizon rather than rcp the average projected potential soil erosion by water increases substantially in rcp8 5 ff 18 and slightly less in other scenarios 7 rcp4 5 nf 8 rcp8 5 nf 13 rcp4 5 ff the area with soil loss rate greater than 1 t ha 1 yr 1 is projected to expand in the future by 0 4 rcp4 5 nf 1 rcp4 5 ff 0 7 rcp8 5 nf and 1 3 rcp8 5 ff high resolution maps show the spatial variation of soil loss in the historical and future period indicating areas vulnerable to water erosion requiring implementation of soil protection measures the highest soil loss rate is found in the south of poland with mean annual erosion rate of 1 7 t ha 1 yr 1 although it occupies only 16 of the territory of poland its share of the total soil loss in poland is 62 8 6 mt year 1 due to the fact that the basis of each spatial planning document is pressure analysis nitrate directive 91 676 eec water framework directive 2000 60 environmental quality standards directive 2008 105 ec the results of our study should be useful for the development of a national policy on soil conservation and environment protection this study helped identify areas vulnerable to erosion that require

3535,soil is a major natural resource fundamental for food production and a habitat for living organisms it is therefore extremely important to prevent its erosion it is assumed that 50 of erosion at the global scale is caused by water a relatively low number of studies model soil loss in northern and eastern europe although that region currently contributes to total soil loss the least the projected long term climate change in europe is likely to affect soil loss due to changes in rainfall characteristics this study quantifies historical soil loss rates based on high resolution datasets and assesses the impact of the projected climate change on long term average annual soil erosion rates in poland located in the temperate climate zone using the revised universal soil loss equation rusle model the study investigates the projected changes for two future time horizons namely 2021 2050 near future nf and 2071 2100 far future ff under two different representative concentration pathways rcp 4 5 and 8 5 to account for the uncertainty of individual climate models an ensemble of nine euro cordex model scenarios was used based on the multi model ensemble median the average soil erosion rate in poland for the historical period is 0 48 t ha 1 yr 1 the total annual soil loss in poland is estimated at 14 mt the highest soil loss rate is observed in the south of poland with mean annual erosion rate of 1 7 t ha 1 yr 1 although it occupies only 16 of the territory of poland its share in total soil loss in the country is 62 8 6 mt year 1 the average projected potential soil erosion by water in the future increases gradually reaching 7 rcp4 5 nf 8 rcp8 5 nf 13 rcp4 5 ff and 18 rcp8 5 ff the results of this study might be valuable for the development of the national soil conservation policy the study fills the spatial gap in modelling of changes in soil erosion caused by climate in the northern and eastern part of europe due to the lack of other national studies in the region the directions of such changes could be transferrable to countries in the same climate zones with a similar vegetation cover structure keywords rusle soil erodibility climate models future erosion gis 1 introduction soil is a major natural resource fundamental for food production a habitat for living organisms and a natural store for carbon and water it is considered a conditionally renewable natural resource i e its excess exploitation eventually reaches a level beyond which regeneration becomes impossible it plays a key role in natural ecosystems therefore there is an unquestionable need to assess and prevent its erosion soil erosion can be divided into four major categories regarding its driving force i e wind water freeze thaw and gravity the share of water driven erosion at the global scale is assumed to account for 50 blanco and lal 2008 it can be considered one of the most serious global issues lal 2017 the kinetic energy of raindrops and flowing water can detach soil particles and remove topsoil from the surface of the earth resulting in reduction of soil fertility and its degradation and consequently a serious agricultural productivity decrease borrelli et al 2018 next to soil condition the negative effects of soil erosion can be also severe for water quality hydrological systems habitats and provision of ecosystem services teng et al 2016 soil erosion assessment is essential and poses a great challenge to researchers and managers however in some parts of the world a very limited number of field scale measurements barely contributes to precise quantification of its rates particularly for large regions vrieling et al 2010 because soil erosion is in most cases impractical to be directly measured for large areas soil erosion models are frequently used to assess the soil loss risk at regional and national levels karydas et al 2014 panagos et al 2015d numerous erosional models differing in terms of complexity data requirements and processes included have been developed worldwide karydas et al 2014 among them the revised universal soil loss equation rusle renard et al 1997 is by far the most commonly used karydas et al 2014 panagos et al 2015d teng et al 2018 rusle is an empirical model of soil erosion developed for sheet and rill erosion it has been originally developed for the farm plot scale but it has been reported to be also applicable to other scales country and continental panagos et al 2015d the justification for its use at the country scale presented in this study is as follows i it depends on relatively easily available soil topographic climatic and vegetation datasets at the country scale ii it is integrated with the gis environment permitting processing large input datasets efficiently iii there is an extensive scientific literature allowing for comparison of the outcomes between specific regions in the world iv it permits not only mapping the actual status of soil erosion but also assessment of the scenario based impact of future climate change on erosion rates which is the ultimate objective of this study the primary factors influencing the amount of water driven soil erosion in rusle are soil type precipitation topography land use and land management globally soil erosion by water is assumed to be a common phenomenon occurring in all climatic conditions the spatial distribution of soil erosion in the world points to the most serious threat for large agricultural areas with intense rainfall events east china india mediterranean europe borrelli et al 2020 next to land cover and climate topography steep slopes and high relief is a key driver locally determining high erosion rates soil erosion is considered a global issue that affects most countries and poland is no exception although several rusle catchment scale applications have been conducted in different areas in poland drzewiecki et al 2014 kijowska strugała et al 2018 no country wide quantitative studies are available to date there are two studies presenting qualitative erosion risk maps 5 classes covering poland józefaciuk and józefaciuk 1995 wawer and nowocień 2007 that indicate the share of land surface potentially threatened with water erosion reaching 30 including 17 with erosion intensity varying from average to very strong although the soil erosion risk in poland is relatively low on average local hot spots with increased erosion risk are identified across the country they are mostly found in the southern mountainous and south eastern part of poland where loess areas are part of the large loess belt spreading from ukraine to northern france and belgium because the reported studies józefaciuk and józefaciuk 1995 wawer and nowocień 2007 are qualitative in their nature a model based quantitative assessment of soil erosion rates at the country scale in poland is necessary a large scale sub continental modelling study using rusle for selected european countries covers the territory of poland panagos et al 2015d however the spatial extent of the study nearly the entire continent required the use of input datasets coarser in terms of their resolution and level of detail for efficient calculations our study fills the spatial gap at the national level by using optimised scale adjusted high quality input datasets changes in the historical pattern of precipitation in europe van den besselaar et al 2013 over the period 1951 2010 indicated an increasing trend in total precipitation amount for the northern part of the continent and decreasing for the southern part the study by szwed 2019 examining monthly precipitation totals in observation stations across poland showed a slightly increasing trend for the entire country it is deservedly expected that in the future the extent and magnitude of soil erosion will increase due to an overall increase in extreme rainfall events caused by climate change consequently the projected long term climate change in europe jacob et al 2014 is likely to affect soil loss because of the changes in rainfall characteristics amount spatio temporal distribution and intensity according to the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc synthesis report ipcc 2021 global mean precipitation will increase by almost 4 in the middle of the century 2041 2060 and by 8 by the period 2081 2100 for europe an increase in annual precipitation in central and northern europe up to 30 and a decrease in southern europe up to 40 is projected for the years 2071 2100 jacob et al 2014 according to high resolution projections for poland mezghani et al 2017 precipitation is expected to increase by up to 10 in the period 2021 2050 and by 16 in the period 2071 2100 considering the projected changes it is assumed that rainfall erosivity capability to cause soil loss from hillslopes is of vast importance among natural factors determining soil loss which in contrast to soil characteristics and crop management is not subject to direct human modifications angulo mart inez and begueria 2009 gupta and kumar 2017 in the context of the projected climate change the effect of future changes in rainfall characteristics on soil erosion is believed to be one of the main concerns of soil conservation studies a number of studies from different regions of the world have recently investigated the long term impact of climate change on soil loss using the rusle model driven by various climate forcing data gupta and kumar 2017 teng et al 2018 duulatov et al 2019 guo et al 2019 most of them reported a significant impact of climate change on soil loss rates it is therefore important and justified to quantify that impact in other parts of the world for a better understanding of their region specific environmental consequences the global study by borrelli et al 2020 reported that a climate induced increase in soil erosion rates is likely to be the most intense in tropical and subtropical regions and much less increase is projected for temperate climate regions an extensive study by borrelli et al 2021 reviewed nearly 1 700 articles and identified regions within which erosion models were primarily applied and those that remain unaddressed the study indicated that a relatively low number of studies investigating the impact of climate change on soil loss have been conducted at the regional or national level in northern and eastern europe in regions of the temperate climate zone with a low share of sparsely vegetated areas it is in contrast to extensively investigated central and southern europe although a general tendency indicated in studies by borrelli et al 2021 concerns the cropland areas in central eastern european countries only few studies are available for scandinavian and baltic countries poland latvia lithuania estonia even though globally such regions are assumed to contribute to total soil loss the least panagos et al 2015d it is important to investigate related potential future changes caused by climate change the low erosion rate calculated for those regions is currently a combination of low rainfall erosivity relatively low slopes and high level of vegetation cover however in the context of projected climate change it is important to test future erosion patterns because characteristics of both rainfall erosivity and vegetation cover might change in the future a global study conducted by borrelli et al 2020 indicated that future land use changes impact global soil erosion processes much less than climate change which had been assumed to be a major driver of future increases in soil erosion therefore this study focuses exclusively on the effect of climate change whereas the factors of cover management and conservation practices were considered constant similar to the current situation to provide useful value for policy makers it is recommended to carry out a detailed analysis at the national scale allowing for the estimation of average erosion rates and identification of critical areas extremely susceptible to erosion which might require particular attention now and in the future suri et al 2002 terranova et al 2009 the main objective of this study is to assess the impact of projected climate change on long term average annual soil erosion rates in poland using the rusle model the study investigates projected changes for two future time horizons namely 2021 2050 near future and 2071 2100 far future under two different rcps 4 5 and 8 5 to account for single climate model uncertainties an ensemble of nine euro cordex model scenarios was used jacob et al 2014 as a reference point baseline scenario for the projected climate change historical 1971 2000 bias corrected ensemble of climate models was used this study is particularly important due to the fact that i it concerns a region in europe which still remains poorly investigated borrelli et al 2021 ii it is the first country scale quantitative assessment of the impact of climate change on soil loss in poland iii it uses an ensemble of nine climate models permitting accounting for single model uncertainties iv it uses a 50 meter resolution digital elevation model dem characterised by very high horizontal rmse 0 1 m and vertical rmse 0 2 m accuracy and high resolution sentinel 2 satellite imagery used for cover management factor calculation 2 materials and methods 2 1 research area with a surface area of 312 683 km2 poland ranks among europe s largest countries it is located in central and eastern europe between the baltic sea and the carpathian mountains it is a predominantly lowland country with its largest part belonging to the central european plain and eastern baltic plain according to the regionalisation by kondracki 2002 the mean elevation of poland is 173 m a s l and the maximum is 2 500 m a s l although nearly 75 of the territory has an elevation below 200 m a s l fig 1 b it is worth emphasizing that a significant part of the country is of hilly character due to the activity of glaciers in the pleistocene the elevation gradient increases towards the south poland has highly variable soils characterised by low content of colloids clay minerals and humic substances pastuszak and igras 2012 most of the country is composed of medium to fast permeable soils with a small share of very slow permeable soils fig 1c most soils in poland were formed after the latest vistulian glaciation formations from earlier glaciations were covered with interglacial and holocene alluvial deposits bedrocks of the majority of soils in poland are various types of pleistocene post glacial deposits in upland and mountainous part of poland bedrocks of contemporary soils are made of formations from earlier geological periods mostly mesozoic high mountains are built from solid magmatic and metamorphic formations whereas low mountains were formed from deposit flysch structures bednarek et al 2004 considering the granulometric composition of bedrocks soils in poland are mostly made up of gravels and sands 46 soils built of clays cover approximately 26 of the country and soils made up of silts nearly 8 the remaining 20 are soils formed from alluvial deposits organogenic structures and carbonate rocks poland features temperate climate with cold winters and warm summers the geographical location of the country and its landform features are the two most important factors determining its climate it is generally influenced by maritime air from the north west cold polar air from russia and scandinavia and subtropical air from the atlantic ocean and the mediterranean sea the highest annual precipitation above 1 000 mm is observed in the mountainous area and the lowest 400 500 mm in the lowland parts fig 1d the average annual precipitation total for poland is 600 mm at the annual scale precipitation in summer is considerably higher compared to winter with an average annual share of 63 and 37 for summer and winter respectively the average number of days with precipitation occurrence greater than 1 mm for poland is 109 days ranging from 94 days in the central to 138 days in the southern part of the country kundzewicz et al 2017 land cover fig 1a in poland predominantly includes agriculture 63 and forests 32 clc2018 agriculture in poland is characterised by high disintegration into a large number of small farms 8 6 ha on average and their unfavorable surface structure czyżewski and brelik 2014 76 of agricultural areas is arable land more prone to erosion and 24 are meadows and pastures soil conservation practices in poland are not very popular and a negligible increase in their application during last decades was noted rogalski and jabłoński 1983 wiśniewski 2014 in poland sheet and rill erosion dominate over gully erosion with their respective share of 82 and 18 józefaciuk and józefaciuk 1992 regarding the spatial distribution of gully erosion it most commonly occurs in the southern part of the country and only sporadically in central poland 2 2 climate change projections this paper is based on climate forcing data at a 5 km resolution from the chase pl climate projections mezghani et al 2017 consisting of nine bias corrected gcm rcm runs involving four different gcms and rcms elaborated within the euro cordex initiative covering projections by 2100 under two emission scenarios rcp4 5 and 8 5 systematic biases in euro cordex rcm runs over poland have been observed that required adjustments therefore a quantile mapping method was applied as a bias correction procedure to reduce systematic bias in climate models gudmundsson et al 2012 the gridded daily precipitation and temperature dataset cplfd gdpt5 was used as reference data in the bias adjustment procedure berezowski et al 2016 the reference dataset covering the entire territory of poland consisted of a 5 km 5 km gridded product of daily precipitation for the period 1951 2013 the quantile mapping of the simulated time series to the observed ones was performed for each grid cell for each of the four seasons separately to take into account the seasonality in the biases quantiles of simulations for the control period 1971 2000 were overlaid with quantiles in the reference data observations transfer functions were then used to correct for the bias in daily precipitation in nine climate model simulations bias corrected historical simulations were evaluated in terms of their ability to reproduce statistical properties of the reference observed dataset for each grid cell a rmse was calculated as a measure of the model s performance annual and seasonal the rmse in precipitation annual means averaged over nine climate models ensemble mean was 15 5 4 4 mm month 1 bias corrected precipitation values covered three time slices 1971 2000 historical period 2021 2050 near future nf and 2071 2100 far future ff according to the projections mezghani et al 2017 precipitation in poland is expected to increase projections for two emission scenarios generally show similar changes for nf a stronger increase is projected for the rcp8 5 scenario for the ff horizon assuming rcp4 5 an increase in average annual mean precipitation by 6 is expected to occur for nf and 10 for ff in seasonal terms the highest increase is expected in winter 8 for nf and 18 for ff and spring 8 for nf and 15 for ff and the lowest in summer 4 for both future time horizons and autumn 7 for both future time horizons regarding the rcp8 5 scenario the expected change for ff is approximately 16 for the annual mean precipitation 27 for winter and spring 5 for summer and 13 for autumn the spatial distribution of precipitation changes ensemble median over poland for all scenarios is presented in fig 2 2 3 rusle model this study applied a modified version of the rusle model renard et al 1997 it integrates six factors related to rainfall erosivity r factor soil erodibility k factor slope length and steepness factor ls factor cover management c factor and conservation practices p factor rusle calculates mean annual soil erosion rates according to the following equation e r k l s c p where e annual average soil loss t ha 1 yr 1 r rainfall erosivity factor mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 k soil erodibility factor t ha h ha 1 mj 1 mm 1 ls slope length and steepness factor c cover management factor and p conservation practices factor 2 3 1 rainfall erosivity r factor rainfall variability in space and time across the investigated area has a considerable effect on the distribution and intensity of soil erosion rainfall erosivity is calculated as a sum of rain kinetic energy and its maximum 30 min intensity however such a detailed pluviographic data is rarely available to overcome this limitation renard and freimund 1994 proposed the use of the modified fournier index arnoldus 1977 for calculating the r factor in regions where long term rainfall intensity data is unavailable mfi i 1 12 p i 2 p t where mfi modified fournier index pi monthly precipitation total in i th month mm pt annual total precipitation mm according to licznar 2004 the applicability of monthly rainfall data to estimate the annual erosivity rainfall factor in poland by using mfi can be expressed by the following equation r 0 226 mfi 1 2876 where r rainfall erosivity factor mj cm ha 1h 1 yr 1 using the 5 km gridded daily precipitation data covering the polish territory the r factor was calculated for each grid cell for the historical period baseline and each emission horizon scenario combination i e rcp4 5 nf rcp4 5 ff rcp8 5 nf rcp8 5 ff in each scenario for every grid cell daily precipitation was aggregated to monthly and yearly sums and the r factor was calculated on the annual basis for all time slices 1971 2000 2021 2050 2071 2100 afterwards thirty year averages of annual rainfall erosivity factor for each time slice and emission scenario was calculated and used in the rusle equation 2 3 2 soil erodibility k factor soil erodibility is defined as a measure of the susceptibility of soil particles to detachment related to the soil structure texture permeability and soil organic matter content in this study k factor values were assigned to a particular soil type based on its texture from the agricultural soil map of poland the soil map in vector format has a resolution of 1 100 000 covers the entire area of the country and stores information on soil texture in each polygon the average area of the uniform soil texture polygon is 1 2 km2 k factor values for different types of soil in poland were derived from the extensive research of the institute of soil science and plant cultivation in puławy wawer et al 2005 stuczyński et al 2010 and other studies conducted in poland drzewiecki et al 2014 2 3 3 slope length and steepness ls factor slope length and steepness describes the effect of topography on soil erosion it represents the product of slope length l and slope steepness s it can be directly measured in the field or derived from dem in this study it was estimated by using the hydrology module available in system for automated geoscientific analyses saga the ls factor field base which incorporates the multiple flow algorithm pilesjö and hasan 2014 a 50 meter resolution dem acquired from the head office of geodesy and cartography in poland characterised by very high horizontal rmse 0 1 m and vertical rmse 0 2 m accuracy fig 1b obtained via light detection and ranging lidar method was used to calculate the slope and catchment area freeman 1991 2 3 4 cover management c factor the cover management factor c is one of the most important measures for assessing the risk of soil erosion it is described as a soil loss ratio of a given plot of land cover to a bare plot ploughed up and down along the slope gradient ayalew et al 2020 soil loss rates are influenced by the stage of vegetation development as well as the type of crops or applied agrotechnical practices panagos et al 2015b and are typically measured several times per year from seedbed preparation to harvesting at different phenological stages of a given crop on a regional to national scale however the c factor values for particular types of land cover are primarily estimated by assigning uniform empirical values from literature it should be emphasized that it does not accurately reflect the actual spatio temporal variability of the vegetation cover which in turn entails inaccuracy in the estimation of the c values to improve the accuracy and reliability of c factor estimation remotely sensed images for generating c factor maps based on vegetation indices such as the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi are commonly used ayalew et al 2020 van der knijff et al 2000 in this study because of the size of the analysed area and the complexity of land cover satellite remote sensing was used to estimate the c factor the study utilises level 1c data from the multispectral instrument msi of sentinel 2a satellite acquired from earthexplorer platform for the growing season of 2020 the msi acquires 13 spectral bands ranging from visible and near infrared vnir to shortwave infrared swir wavelengths table 1 satellite data processing included atmospheric and geometric correction as well as cloud masking sen2cor processor was used to correct sentinel 2a level 1c data product from the effects of the atmosphere in order to deliver surface reflectance data further data processing was performed in envi 5 3 esri arcgis 10 5 and gdal 3 0 4 the remote sensing method of c factor determination was based on the spectral vegetation index ndvi using exponential regression c van der knijff et al 2000 ndvi nir r e d nir r e d where nir is the surface spectral reflectance in the near infrared band band 8 of msi data see table 1 and red is the surface spectral reflectance in the red band band 4 c e x p α ndvi β n d v i where α and β are parameters related to the shape of the curve that associates ndvi with the c factor the values of 2 and 1 were used as the best representatives for european climate conditions of equation parameters α and β respectively according to van der knijff et al 2000 the ndvi value in van der knijff equation was calculated as a mean value of ndvi for all periods when erosion is active from april to september kulimushi et al 2021a 2 3 5 conservation practices p factor the conservation practices p factor imitates the impact of support practices reducing the rate of average annual soil loss it is described as the ratio between soil erosion on a field with support practices carried on to the loss on the same field with no support practices applied in this study the p factor for poland was derived from the map for europe developed by panagos et al 2015c 2 3 6 data processing and soil erosion calculation input maps in raster format were resampled r and p factor and aggregated k and c factor to a reference resolution of dem 50 m before multiplication soil loss was estimated for 94 of the country area because surfaces not prone to soil erosion i e bare rocks urban areas surface water bodies wetlands cover 6 of the area of poland annual soil erosion maps for poland at a resolution of 50 m were calculated by integrating constant values of k ls c and p factors and variant climate scenario derived r factors 45 in total although c factor is dynamic in short term according to borrelli et al 2020 future land use changes impact global soil erosion processes much less than climate change which had been assumed to be a major driver of future increases in soil erosion a similar approach has been proposed in other studies investigating the impact of climate change on soil erosion gupta and kumar 2017 chakrabortty et al 2020 hateffard et al 2021 regarding the p factor according to panagos et al 2015c the average p factor value for poland is 0 9781 considering very low popularity of conservation practices in poland and negligible increase in their application over the recent decades rogalski and jabłoński 1983 wiśniewski 2014 it was kept constant in future time horizons moreover keeping the p factor constant in future scenarios could be informative for decision makers on how the erosion rates change when current soil conservation policy is maintained nine maps were created for the historical period which served as a reference baseline scenario describing current conditions for future scenarios nine maps were derived for each combination of rcp 4 5 and 8 5 and time horizon nf and ff providing four sub sets with overall number of 36 soil loss maps four times nine climate models to describe average conditions for poland for each of the model input datasets and output soil loss maps spatial mean values raster data statistics mean were calculated in order to describe extreme low and high conditions 10th and 90th percentiles raster data statistics percentile were estimated the calculated statistics concerning the r factor and output soil loss maps were presented in box plots to indicate the variability of individual climate models in five sub sets one historical and four future scenarios for the interpretation of r factor maps and the resulting soil erosion maps to account for the individual climate model uncertainty pixel wise ensemble median values from nine maps were calculated for each sub set historical rcp4 5 nf rcp4 5 ff rcp8 5 nf rcp8 5 ff the methodological flowchart of the analysis is presented in fig 3 3 results 3 1 input factors of rusle model multi annual average rainfall erosivity for poland was calculated separately for nine climate models for the historical period 1971 2000 and two future time horizons 2021 2050 2071 2100 under rcp4 5 and 8 5 fig 4 while the spatial distribution of the r factor varies between climate models for the historical period a general agreement on the decreasing gradient from the southern mountainous region to the central lowland part of the country is observed for the climate models ensemble all climate models also reflect the influence of the baltic sea in the northern part of the country where the r factor increases locally compared to the central part of poland average rainfall erosivity conditions for poland calculated as spatial mean for the entire country vary between climate models ensemble median of the mean r factor for poland is 588 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 ranging between 543 and 609 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 fig 5 a climate models ensemble median of the 10th percentile r factor for poland is 504 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 ranging between 462 and 526 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 fig 5b and the 90th percentile is 693 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 640 715 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 fig 5c rainfall erosivity projections for future time horizons regardless of the rcp seem to maintain the spatial distribution across poland observed in the historical period characterised by a decreasing gradient from south to north locally increasing in the seaside region fig 4 however significant differences in the magnitude of change can be observed not only between the climate models but particularly between time horizons and rcps the increase generally intensifies with time horizon and rcp scenario reaching the highest values for rcp8 5 ff fig 5 a significantly lower increase in rainfall erosivity is observed for rcp4 5 nf in the comparison of the single impact of the rcp scenario and time horizon the latter seems to influence the r factor more intensely fig 5a shows changes in average conditions of rainfall erosivity for poland driven by climate change projections the multi model ensemble median of mean r factor values across poland constantly increases from 627 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 in rcp4 5 nf reaching 688 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 for rcp8 5 ff a similar trend is observed for extreme rainfall erosivity conditions fig 5b and c the multi model ensemble median for 10th percentile reaches maximum values for rcp8 5 ff 584 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 and for 90th percentile 810 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 in order to present the spatial distribution of change in rainfall erosivity across poland driven by climate change an absolute difference between each projected scenario and climate models baseline historical period is shown in fig 6 positive values indicate an increase and negative a decrease in the r factor although on average an increase in the r factor is expected to occur in poland according to the multi model ensemble fig 5 certain climate models indicate a local decrease in rainfall erosivity fig 6 the spatial distribution of r factor change is generally highly variable between individual climate models and no clear pattern is observed the spatial distribution of the k factor fig 7 a was obtained by ascribing each soil texture with a respective k value from the agricultural soil map according to the literature of wawer et al 2005 stuczyński et al 2010 and drzewiecki et al 2014 the k values ranged from 0 003 t ha h ha 1 mj 1 mm 1 for soils with high organic matter content to 0 05 t ha h ha 1 mj 1 mm 1 for loamy very fine sands the mean k factor for poland was estimated at 0 016 t ha h ha 1 mj 1 mm 1 with a standard deviation of 0 009 t ha h ha 1 mj 1 mm 1 according to the map 80 of the country is covered by soils with k factor 0 02 t ha h ha 1 mj 1 mm 1 indicating a low erodible class the most erodible soils k values in a range from 0 03 to 0 05 t ha h ha 1 mj 1 mm 1 were mostly found in the southern and south eastern part of poland where loess areas are part of the large loess belt spreading from ukraine to northern france and belgium the analysis revealed the mean ls factor value for poland of 0 47 with a standard deviation of 1 42 fig 7b the lowest value ls factor occurred in the central part of poland while the highest value occurred in the south fig 7b shows that high ls values were consistent with high topography and coincided with mountain scarps that rendered these areas extremely susceptible to erosion the spatial distribution of c factor values is presented in fig 7c in poland the highest share of territory is occupied by agricultural areas 63 for which the mean c factor value was estimated at 0 08 significantly lower values 0 003 were estimated for forests which cover approximately 32 of poland the highest c factor values were assigned to bare lands and sparsely vegetated areas 0 22 which occupy merely 0 02 of the territory the average c factor value for poland was estimated as 0 08 according to panagos et al 2015c who estimated the p factor at the european level the mean value for poland was 0 9781 fig 7d due to the limited application of contour farming in the country the spatial distribution of the p factor is presented in fig 7d 3 2 historical soil erosion rates before the impact of the projected climate change on soil erosion can be estimated it is crucial to determine the reliable reference conditions so called baseline scenario of soil loss in poland for the historical period the climate model ensemble median of the areal mean annual rate of soil loss due to water erosion for the historical period in poland is 0 48 t ha 1 yr 1 the multi model ensemble median for areal 10th percentile of soil erosion rate is 0 009 t ha 1 yr 1 and for 90th percentile 1 05 t ha 1 yr 1 the total annual soil loss of poland is estimated at 14 mt the highest soil loss rate is found in the south of poland due to the combination of high rainfall erosivity and topography mountainous region and in the south eastern part of the country mostly due to the presence of highly erosive loess soils and topography highlands region the mean annual erosion rate for this vulnerable region of poland is 1 7 t ha 1 yr 1 it should be emphasised that although it occupies only 16 of the territory of poland its share of the total soil loss in poland is 62 8 6 mt year 1 the central lowland part of the country with the lowest annual precipitation total is mostly characterised by a low soil loss rate 0 1 t ha 1 yr 1 and the northern part by moderate erosion 0 3 t ha 1 yr 1 fig 8 3 3 projected future soil loss potential average annual soil loss was predicted with respect to the change in rainfall erosivity while the other factors were kept constant fig 9 shows multi model ensemble box plots presenting calculated grid based statistics mean 10th and 90th percentile for poland for each combination of rcp time horizon compared to the historical period all grid based statistics increase in future projections and the increase gradually intensifies with rcp and time horizon in rcp4 5 the multi model ensemble median of annual mean soil loss for poland was 0 50 t ha 1 yr 1 for nf and 0 53 t ha 1 yr 1 for ff in rcp8 5 the corresponding values were 0 51 t ha 1 yr 1 and 0 55 t ha 1 yr 1 the remaining grid based statistics for poland according to the multi model ensemble median increase as well reaching the highest annual soil loss rates for rcp8 5 0 0104 t ha 1 yr 1 grid based 10th percentile and 1 20 t ha 1 yr 1 grid based 90th percentile fig 9 to extend the perspective of climate driven increase in soil loss rates an absolute and relative change future projection compared to historical period was calculated for each climate model in fig 10 grid based statistics mean and 90th percentile were performed within the country borders for each combination of climate model rcp time horizon and presented in box plots in rcp4 5 nf the multi model ensemble median of annual average soil loss change indicated an absolute increase by 0 02 t ha 1 yr 1 corresponding with a relative increase by 7 for the remaining rcp time horizon combinations the following changes were observed 0 03 t ha 1 yr 1 8 rcp8 5 nf 0 058 t ha 1 yr 1 13 rcp4 5 ff and 0 08 t ha 1 yr 1 18 rcp8 5 ff for 90th percentile statistics for poland the projected changes were more intense in rcp4 5 nf the multi model ensemble median of 90th percentile soil loss change indicated an absolute increase by 0 05 t ha 1 yr 1 giving a relative increase by 13 for the remaining rcp time horizon combinations the following changes were observed 0 08 t ha 1 yr 1 15 5 rcp8 5 nf 0 12 t ha 1 yr 1 18 rcp4 5 nf and 0 17 t ha 1 yr 1 27 rcp8 5 ff it should be emphasised that although the projected absolute rates of soil erosion increase are relatively low the relative increase is rather high particularly for rcp8 5 ff in fig 11 gridded maps of average annual soil erosion consisting of multi model ensemble median values for each pixel were presented for each rcp time horizon combination the spatial distribution of soil erosion projections across poland generally seems to remain similar to that for the historical period it is worth emphasizing that the share of an area with soil loss rate greater than 1 t ha 1 yr 1 compared to the historical period 9 9 increases gradually reaching 10 3 rcp4 5 nf 10 9 rcp4 5 ff 10 6 rcp8 5 nf and 11 2 rcp8 5 ff which corresponds to 32 052 km2 33 664 km2 32 874 km2 and 34 826 km2 of the country s surface area respectively the total annual soil loss of poland compared to historical 14 mt yr 1 in future projections increases to approximately 14 6 mt yr 1 15 4 mt yr 1 15 1 mt yr 1 and 16 mt yr 1 for rcp4 5 nf rcp4 5 ff rcp8 5 nf and rcp8 5 ff respectively for the most vulnerable regions in southern poland a significant increase in soil erosion rate is expected for rcp8 5 ff 2 1 t ha 1 yr 1 for the remaining climate scenarios the increase is less intensive reaching 1 8 t ha 1 yr 1 1 9 t ha 1 yr 1 and 1 9 t ha 1 yr 1 for rcp4 5 nf rcp4 5 ff and rcp8 5 nf respectively because changes in the magnitude of soil loss between the projections are hard to detect due to the high resolution of maps presented in fig 11 additional maps of relative change future projection compared to historical period in soil loss rates for each of the climate models are presented in fig 12 the diversity of spatial distribution of soil loss relative change regarding the climate models is very high for all scenarios rcps and time horizons although the average values for poland indicated a general increase in soil loss rates maps for individual climate models show patches with a slight decrease up to 15 in the comparison of the scenarios it mostly occurs in nf and is barely noticed in ff where values of relative increase of soil loss locally reach 70 the obviously patchy pattern of soil loss relative change for individual climate models follows the pattern of projected rainfall erosivity across poland 4 discussion 4 1 rusle factors most studies on rainfall erosivity in poland to date have been conducted at a local to regional level using either high temporal resolution 30 min banasik et al 2001 baryła 2004 święchowicz 2013 or coarse resolution daily drzewiecki et al 2014 kijowska strugała et al 2018 precipitation datasets none of the previous studies however has covered the entire country panagos et al 2015a calculated the r factor for 29 european countries based on high temporal resolution precipitation datasets 60 min and reported mean value for poland equal to 537 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 in the reference study however the network of high resolution monitoring stations in poland was reported to be sparse nine stations covering the period 1961 1988 and unevenly distributed across the country stations concentrated in the eastern part which could affect the accuracy of the spatial distribution of rainfall erosivity across poland as presented the r factor for poland based on the mfi used in this study is slightly higher climate models ensemble median 588 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 and represents different spatial distribution it is worth emphasising however that the r factor distribution based on mfi follows the actual rainfall distribution in poland cf fig 1d and 4 most studies on the k factor reported in poland have been carried out at a local level wawer et al 2005 święchowicz 2010 panagos et al 2014a calculated the k factor with a resolution of 500 m at the european level including the entire area of poland in the reference study the mean k factor for poland was reported as 0 029 t ha h ha 1 mj 1 mm 1 which is around 80 higher compared to our results the use of a fine resolution 1 100 000 soil agricultural map in our study improves the spatial distribution of soil types to which the k factor was assigned to assess the obtained results of the spatial distribution of the c factor the statistics within corine land cover classes from 2018 were calculated and then compared with values obtained by other researchers table 2 moreover such comparison was also important because some authors reported problems due to the sensitivity of the ndvi derived c factor values to several biophysical parameters such as vitality and density of the vegetation cover soil background differences and variations in topographic features ayalew et al 2020 matsushita et al 2007 the range of possible values for the c factor presented in table 2 was obtained from panagos et al 2015b who developed them based on the most cited studies covering different countries in europe it is worth emphasising that c factor values obtained in this study fall within the most frequently reported land cover specific values table 2 the impact of individual rusle factors on the estimated soil loss is diverse and strongly depends on environmental and management settings although precipitation is the primary driving force of soil erosion it has been proved that the r factor is not perfectly correlated with soil loss wang et al 2018 kulimushi et al 2021a this stresses the crucial impact of the remaining factors for instance ma et al 2012 and kulimushi et al 2021b reported the ls factor to be key contributor to soil loss in highland and mountainous regions characterised by steep slopes tetzlaff and wendland 2012 applied usle type soil erosion model to medium sized watershed in germany with heterogeneous landscape and topography they indicated that beside ls the k factor has the highest impact on soil erosion potential because the identified risk areas in the watershed strongly correlated with loess soils distribution tetzlaff and wendland 2012 also reported very low soil losses for plain lands with high vegetation coverage pointing to the importance of the c factor in the region on the other hand ma et al 2012 reported that even in the hilly and mountainous region in china with high ls factor values an increase in vegetation cover and optimised land use structure as a result of human activities might reduce the erosion risk this study covered the entire territory of poland highly diverse in terms of topology soil distribution rainfall intensity and land use types for details see section 2 1 therefore the influence of rusle factors on soil erosion is region specific for instance in the southern mountainous part of poland characterized by the highest slopes and precipitation totals the ls and p factors are of key importance in determining high erosion rates which is in line with the findings of ma et al 2012 and kulimushi et al 2021b for mountainous regions in other parts of the world like in results presented by tetzlaff and wendland 2012 we found that erosion risk areas are closely correlated with loess soils distribution prevailing in southern and south eastern poland in the central part of poland characterised by lowland relief and low erodible soils the risk of erosion is very low considering the c factor map for poland the spatial variability of soil erosion seems to highly coincide with land use as was also observed by fu et al 2009 and kulimushi et al 2021b in other parts of the world large areas of poland are characterised by low erosion due to the presence of forests covering approximately 31 of the country because the significance of the c factor in determining the distribution of soil erosion rate is well known there is a number of studies finding the c factor to be defined dynamic in time borrelli et al 2020 kulimushi et al 2021b such an approach is particularly important for regions undergoing substantial changes in land use for instance due to deforestation kulimushi et al 2021b according to mierzwiak and całka 2019 who analysed clc maps of poland from 1990 to 2012 the area of land cover changes in poland during that period was very small and it did not exceeded 1 of the country s territory therefore in this study the c factor map was kept constant for future scenarios moreover considering very low popularity of conservation practices in poland and a negligible increase in their application over the recent decades rogalski and jabłoński 1983 wiśniewski 2014 the p factor was kept constant in future time horizons a similar approach is found in other studies focused on the projected impact of climate change on soil erosion chapman et al 2021 hateffard et al 2021 4 2 historical soil loss as baseline scenario before the estimation of the impact of the projected climate change on soil erosion it is crucial to have reliable reference conditions so called baseline scenario of soil loss in poland for the historical period the assessment of the accuracy of the historical soil loss rate involved comparison of our results at 50 m resolution with other european scale studies namely 100 m resolution rusle2015 panagos et al 2015d 1 km resolution eionet soil panagos et al 2014b and 1 km resolution pesera kirkby et al 2008 it is worth emphasising that pesera and eionet soil products differ not only in terms of resolution but also modelling approaches and input datasets rusle2015 differs in terms of resolution and estimation methods for particular factors r k and c but the general approach is similar as that in our study despite the differences all the products have been extensively used in europe and their direct comparison appears justified for each of the models an areal mean soil loss rate for poland has been calculated and the rates are as follows rusle2015 0 96 t ha 1 yr 1 pesera 0 83 t ha 1 yr 1 and eionet soil 1 46 t ha 1 yr 1 compared to our results 0 48 t ha 1 yr 1 all three models indicated higher soil loss rates high compliance however occured in the spatial distribution of soil erosion in all models several studies are available in poland that simulate soil erosion using the rusle model drzewiecki et al 2014 calculated soil loss for the małopolska voivodeship southern poland and reported an average soil loss rate of 3 8 t ha 1 yr 1 which is higher than our estimations for that region 2 9 t ha 1 yr 1 according to the analysis of single components of the rusle equation the difference was mainly caused by the r and c factor the period for which drzewiecki et al 2014 applied the rusle model was characterised by higher precipitation moreover they estimated the c factor based on literature in contrast to our ndvi approach our results suggest that in the historical context poland is not highly ranked regarding soil erosion rates in comparison to other european countries considering the reported average soil loss rates for 29 countries panagos et al 2015d poland is placed in the 1st quartile 0 51 t ha 1 yr 1 lower erosion was reported in scandinavian countries sweden finland and baltic countries estonia latvia and significantly higher in mediterranean countries italy greece malta the share of poland s contribution in the total soil loss in the european union was estimated for 1 5 according to jones et al 2004 the tolerated threshold for soil erosion is 1 t ha 1 yr 1 which is considered to be sustainable given the soil formation rates in the historical period in poland based on the multi model ensemble median annual average soil loss grid fig 8 the share of an area with soil loss rate greater than 1 t ha 1 yr 1 accounts for 9 9 30 564 km2 historical studies józefaciuk and józefaciuk 1995 wawer and nowocień 2007 assessed the share of land surface potentially threatened with water erosion in poland for a total of 30 the qualitative nature of the latter studies however did not relate the risk classes to any particular erosion rates and therefore quantitative comparison of our results with these studies is difficult it needs to be emphasised that spatial distribution in all three maps is characterised with high similarity and consistency especially in the case of mapping high erosion risk areas following the threshold proposed by jones et al 2004 of 1 t ha 1 yr 1 for tolerable soil loss we postulate that the actual share of land surface potentially threatened with water erosion in poland is 9 9 it should be emphasised that our study on soil loss in poland does not challenge the reference studies its intention was to use the most recent high quality input datasets to refine the soil loss rates at a national scale studies at the regional local level in poland drzewiecki et al 2014 święchowicz 2010 and at the european scale panagos et al 2015d are currently available our study fills the spatial gap at the national level using optimised scale adjusted high quality input datasets the major input layers increasing the accuracy of soil loss rates used in this study are as follows 1 50 meter resolution dem characterised by very high horizontal rmse 0 1 m and vertical rmse 0 2 m accuracy 2 high resolution 50 meter soil erodibility map and 3 sentinel 2 satellite imagery derived c factor the resulting map of soil loss rates constitutes a compromise between input data quality resolution and computational capabilities at the national scale 4 3 climate change driven soil loss changes no studies on climate induced changes of rainfall erosivity strongly determining soil loss have been reported at a regional or national scale in the territory of poland to date panagos et al 2017 estimated future rainfall erosivity in europe based on hadgem2 climate model projections for rcp4 5 and the time frame of 2041 2060 it closely corresponds to the scenario rcp4 5 nf presented in this study allowing for a simple comparison of the results according to panagos et al 2017 mean r factor for the projected future scenario for poland was 814 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 whereas in this study mean value for poland expressed as a multi model ensemble median for rcp4 5 nf scenario was 627 mj mm ha 1 h 1 yr 1 which is notably lower regardless of the magnitude the direction of change is consistent in both studies a clear advancement of our study is the use of multi model ensemble projections dealing with uncertainty regarding future climate change of a single model parker 2013 as presented here the future relative increase in soil loss for poland might reach up to 18 on average it should be emphasized however that it corresponds to an absolute increase by 0 08 t ha 1 yr 1 assumed to be a relatively low increase at the national scale considering the regional context a much higher increase up to 24 0 4 t ha 1 yr 1 is observed in the southern part of the country dominated by highly erosive loess soils and steep slopes the vulnerability of that region in poland to soil erosion has been reported in historical studies józefaciuk and józefaciuk 1995 wawer and nowocień 2007 and quantified in this study baseline scenario in future scenarios total annual soil loss for that particular region occupying 16 of the polish territory constantly increases reaching up to 9 7 mt corresponding with 62 of total soil loss for the entire country the projected increase in soil erosion for southern poland was calculated using constant p factor i e no change in conservation practices to indicate to environmental managers what could possibly happen if current conservation measures are maintained if no additional actions are taken in the context of climate change soil loss in the region may intensify the study quantitatively presents that the majority of soil loss in poland is concentrated in a relatively small territory this clearly shows where soil conservation policy and measures should be focused to reduce the erosion risk the most efficiently worldwide applications of the impact of climate change on soil loss from different regions and climate zones using models from the 5th phase of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 reported that future changes in precipitation values will highly affect soil erosion by water teng et al 2018 hateffard et al 2021 girmay et al 2021 consistently with our results regardless of the climatic zone in the reference studies the highest increase is projected under rcp8 5 reported by borrelli et al 2020 to provide the basis for soil conservation planning in that study borrelli et al 2020 conducted for the entire globe the projected soil loss for poland by 2070 under rcp8 5 was contrary to our findings negligible 0 5 it might be a result of the scale of the analysis and consequently the degree of detail of input datasets the use of much coarser gcm climate data and combined effect of climate and land use change investigated in the study by borrelli et al 2020 as presented in our study employing high resolution datasets and downscaled rcm ensemble the potential changes of future soil loss for poland following rcp8 5 are more pronounced averaging up to 18 this coincides with previous studies suggesting a direct correlation of precipitation amounts with soil erosion darwish et al 2016 doulabian et al 2021 at the european level panagos et al 2021 investigated the impact of climate change on future rates of soil erosion by water in 2050 within agricultural areas for poland a 20 increase in soil loss was projected under rcp8 5 it can be compared with our results for rcp8 5 nf pointing to an increase by 10 6 there is therefore a general agreement on the future direction of change in soil erosion in poland but the magnitude of the increase differs between the studies the differences appear to be caused by the use of different ensembles of climate models gcm vs gcm rcm as the projected increase in rainfall erosivity differs significantly between the studies the relative change projected for europe by panagos et al 2021 reaches 36 9 rcp8 5 which is significantly higher than that for the euro cordex ensemble used in our study for poland 10 the difference might also be caused by the fact that in contrast to our study panagos et al 2021 estimated the combined effect of climate and land use change on soil loss the national scale of this study allows for the determination of hot spot areas vulnerable to soil loss in future time horizons and planning of soil conservation actions preventing future erosion caused by rainfall changes the study fills the spatial gap in modelling the impact of climate change on soil erosion in this part of europe and the temperate climate zone borrelli et al 2021 future national applications could benefit from the presented study s data sources and calculation scheme especially that euro cordex covers the entire european continent although some general directions of climate change driven soil loss change in the future could be transferred from our study to other countries with similar land cover structure and climate characteristics detailed applications for other parts of europe are still needed borrelli et al 2021 4 4 practical implementation from the hydrological perspective the projected future increase in soil erosion over poland may have a wide range of consequences affecting water quality reservoirs operation flood risk sedimentation and waterways clogging issaka and ashraf 2017 morris 2020 olorunfemi et al 2020 posthumus et al 2015 given that erosion is a process that involves an increase in surface runoff which in turn accelerates phosphorus loss from the soil carpenter and bennett 2011 there is a potential threat of excessive eutrophication of water particularly in areas of high erosion risk southern poland smoroń 2012 investigated the risk of surface water eutrophication in loess uplands in southern poland and reported high total phosphorus concentrations as a result of soil erosion by water the projected increase in the soil erosion rate in the southern region of poland could potentially intensify the eutrophication of inland waters madeyski et al 2008 reported high silting of reservoirs in southern poland with the rate of silting greatly exceeding the mean value for poland they reported agricultural areas to be the primary contributors to sediment erosion that decreases the reservoir s capacity through silting the projected future increase in soil loss might accelerate the rate of further silting potentially strongly increasing the flood risk and consequently leading to infrastructure failure in the southern mountainous area of poland the results reported at the national scale can provide the basis for the identification of erosion hot spots and for policy decision making regarding disaster prevention and conservation measures 4 5 study uncertainties climate change impact studies are burdened with numerous uncertainties that can be classified as intrinsic and knowledge related toimil et al 2020 intrinsic uncertainty irreducible in its nature giorgi 2010 is related to emission scenarios and the internal variability of the climate system knowledge uncertainty results from the imperfect knowledge of earth s physical processes comprising climate model projections bias correction and downscaling methods and impact models the highest uncertainty in climate change impact studies is primarily attributed to climate model outputs chen et al 2011 to minimise it it is broadly recommended to use gcm rcm ensembles teutschbein and seibert 2010 eekhout and de vente 2019 therefore in this study an ensemble of nine climate models gcm rcm combinations was included to account for differences in projected changes in soil loss in soil erosion assessment studies a particular uncertainty was attributed to downscaling and bias correction methods li and fang 2016 it is due to the fact that soil erosion is found to be more sensitive to changes in rainfall intensity than precipitation total nunes et al 2009 and not all bias correction methods are able to account for such changes it has been reported that in contrast to the delta change method déqué 2007 quantile mapping wood et al 2004 is able to transfer projected changes in rainfall intensity from gcm to soil erosion model input paroissien et al 2015 kourgialas et al 2016 therefore in this study we used a climate model dataset corrected using the quantile mapping method to reduce systematic bias in climate models gudmundsson et al 2012 and reflect changes in rainfall intensity in the future which is more suited to soil erosion assessment another source of knowledge uncertainty is related to the impact model recent studies have continued to question the use of empirical models such as rusle to evaluate erosion rates emphasising the advantage of more field based assessment of water erosion over the modelling approach evans 2013 it is obvious that modelling cannot be an alternative to field measurement and on site monitoring nonetheless it becomes crucial and necessary when it comes to large scale evaluations especially when no field data are available panagos et al 2016 the rusle model is also often contested and criticised due to the fact that most equations have been developed based on plot scale experiments in the usa however it was also proved that careful consideration and adaptation of the model parameters to site or region specific conditions ensures reliable soil loss estimations alewell et al 2019 it is generally agreed that models should be validated with measured data for usle type models applied at a large scale however such validation is limited by the absence of field measurements covering the area of interest recent studies have confirmed that accurate parametrisation reduces the uncertainty of usle type modelling meusburger et al 2013 yue et al 2016 moreover some authors suggest that a cross comparison of modelling results with available studies can provide insights on the plausibility of modelling predictions borrelli et al 2020 hence to obtain reliable soil loss estimation for poland using rusle high resolution input data were collected and processed and the final results were compared to other studies covering the polish territory 5 conclusions this study describes historical and future projected soil loss rates in poland using the latest high resolution datasets and the rusle model in order to compensate for the uncertainty among the different climate models an ensemble of nine euro cordex model scenarios under rcp4 5 and 8 5 were used for the historical period 1971 2000 and two future time horizons 2021 2050 2071 2100 a 50 meter resolution soil loss map was produced for each scenario based on the multi model ensemble median the average soil erosion rate in poland for the historical period is 0 48 t ha 1 yr 1 and the share of an area with soil loss rate greater than 1 t ha 1 yr 1 considered to be the threshold tolerated for soil erosion accounts for 9 9 of poland s territory total annual soil loss for poland is estimated at 14 mt due to change in rainfall intensity and spatio temporal distribution caused by climate change future predictions of soil erosion point to an overall increase in soil loss the projected increase differs among the scenarios and appears to be more influenced by the time horizon rather than rcp the average projected potential soil erosion by water increases substantially in rcp8 5 ff 18 and slightly less in other scenarios 7 rcp4 5 nf 8 rcp8 5 nf 13 rcp4 5 ff the area with soil loss rate greater than 1 t ha 1 yr 1 is projected to expand in the future by 0 4 rcp4 5 nf 1 rcp4 5 ff 0 7 rcp8 5 nf and 1 3 rcp8 5 ff high resolution maps show the spatial variation of soil loss in the historical and future period indicating areas vulnerable to water erosion requiring implementation of soil protection measures the highest soil loss rate is found in the south of poland with mean annual erosion rate of 1 7 t ha 1 yr 1 although it occupies only 16 of the territory of poland its share of the total soil loss in poland is 62 8 6 mt year 1 due to the fact that the basis of each spatial planning document is pressure analysis nitrate directive 91 676 eec water framework directive 2000 60 environmental quality standards directive 2008 105 ec the results of our study should be useful for the development of a national policy on soil conservation and environment protection this study helped identify areas vulnerable to erosion that require

aquifer and aquitard drawdown and groundwater budget i e fractions of groundwater withdrawal including aquifer depletion aquitard depletion and leakage from the unconfined aquifer within a leaky aquifer system considering an exponentially decaying k of the aquitard parameterized with a dimensionless decay coefficient a d relevant semi analytical solutions were derived using the laplace transform and hankel transform techniques while drawdown and groundwater budget characteristics and their sensitivities to a d were theoretically analyzed theoretical analysis results suggested that a larger a d consistently leads to a larger aquifer drawdown a smaller aquitard drawdown a larger fraction of aquifer depletion and a smaller fraction of leakage from the unconfined aquifer sensitivity analysis results also indicated critical effects of a d on well hydraulics and groundwater budget comparative analysis revealed that none of the three typical mean values of depth decaying aquitard k can perfectly characterize the well hydraulics and groundwater budget from early to intermediate times however the harmonic and geometric mean values can be feasibly used to calculate the final fractions of aquifer depletion and aquitard depletion at late times respectively limitations of the newly developed analytical model have also been discussed practical investigations of vertical

hydrogeological parameters in the investigations of well hydraulics in groundwater hydrology demir et al 2017 kazakis et al 2016 lai and ren 2016 for a hydrogeological unit e g an aquifer or an aquitard k is frequently regarded as a constant in space luo and illman 2016 zhuang et al 2020 however many studies have shown that k is sensitive to the slight change in porosity asfahani 2017 koltermann and gorelick 1995 yamaguchi and nakamura 1994 from the perspective of soil deposition the porosity of a hydrogeological unit usually decreases with the burial depth due to the compaction or other physical and chemical effects resulting in an obvious variation of k along the depth profile chen et al 2020 jiang et al 2010 kuang and jiao 2014 sakata and ikeda 2013 a depth dependent k usually manifests as a large scale hydraulic conductivity heterogeneity which has been widely observed in geologic media e g achtziger zupancic et al 2017 cardenas and jiang 2010 chen et al 2018 2021

al 2011 saar and manga 2004 sakata 2015 sakata and ikeda 2013 for instance chen et al 2018 collected 13 397 k measurements through borehole packer tests at 12 dam sites in southwest china and found that the k of igneous and metamorphic rocks follows a power law relationship decreasing with depth achtziger zupancic et al 2017 also found that the decreasing pattern of k versus the depth for crystalline rocks basically follows a power law function after compiling 29 000 in situ data from 221 publications and reports besides many studies also showed that k could exponentially decay with depth and the decay exponent varies from 1 10 2 to 1 10 4 m 1 at some specific locations luo et al 2011 manning and ingebritsen 1999 saar and manga 2004 wang et al 2009 considering the effect of an exponentially decaying k with depth jiang et al 2009 found that the decay exponent would significantly affect the development of local versus regional flow systems subsequently jiang et al 2011 obtained analytical solutions for head and stream functions in basins with depth decaying k where the decay exponent varied from 0 to 0 008 m 1 and then discussed the positions of stagnation points and the dynamic characteristic of groundwater flow around the stagnation points sakata and ikeda 2013 found that the monotonic gravelly aquifer within the toyohira river alluvial fan sapporo japan demonstrated a depth decaying k with a decay exponent of approximately 0 11 m 1 for a depth profile from the surface down to 30 m depth and such a relatively large decay exponent value was mainly attributed to the depth varying contents of fine grained sediments within the pore space of gravel particles many previous studies have considered that k of an aquifer could exponentially decrease with depth to consider the larger compressibility leake 1990 li et al 2019 and comparative thickness bredehoeft et al 1983 hendry et al 1991 neuzil 1995 zhuang et al 2015 2020 of silty and clayey aquitard layers in real hydrogeological investigations compared with sandy aquifers the aquitard k may show more obvious features of depth dependence under lithostatic stress ferris et al 2020 collected the hydrogeological data of the pleistocene aged till aquitard at 15 sites of the south central region of saskatchewan canada which were sorted out by 21 studies and found that the aquitard k did show an obvious exponentially decaying trend with depth the decay exponent is approximately 0 15 m 1 and the range of k variation reached five orders of magnitude within a depth of 80 m other studies also indicated that the variability and scale dependence of k in some shallow aquitards were especially significant hendry 1988 keller et al 1989 schulze makuch et al 1999 van der kamp 2001 the above evidences suggest that the depth decaying aquitard k cannot be ignored and may have significant effects on the dynamics of groundwater level and on the evaluation of groundwater resources during groundwater exploitation however most investigations regarding leaky aquifer systems typically have assumed that the aquitard k is spatially constant e g hantush 1960 konikow and neuzil 2007 neuman and witherspoon 1972 wen et al 2008b to the best of our knowledge there are few studies considering the depth decaying aquitard k in the investigations of well hydraulics in this study we will first derive the semi analytical solutions of well hydraulics i e pumping induced aquifer and aquitard drawdown where the aquitard k is considered to exponentially decay with burial depth secondly the solutions will be further used to explore the drawdown characteristics and to evaluate the groundwater budget i e the aquifer depletion the leakage from the unconfined aquifer to the aquitard and the aquitard depletion thirdly sensitivity analysis of well hydraulics and groundwater budget to the decay exponent will be conducted finally the groundwater budget corresponding to an exponentially decaying aquitard k will be compared to those based on different scenarios of mean aquitard k 2 mathematical model 2 1 governing equations consider the classical three layer aquifer aquitard system undergoing constant rate pumping water from a fully penetrated well as shown in fig 1 to conduct an analytical analysis some assumptions are introduced as follows 1 both the aquifer and aquitard are infinitely extensive and with a uniform thickness 2 the pumped confined aquifer is homogeneous and isotropic while the aquitard is heterogeneous as its hydraulic conductivity exponentially decays with burial depth but is isotropic 3 the flow in the confined aquifer is horizontal while the flow in the aquitard is vertical 4 the flow in both the confined aquifer and aquitard obeys darcy s law 5 the entire aquifer aquitard system is initially static 6 the hydraulic head of the unconfined aquifer remains constant during pumping 7 groundwater flow is transient in all units and 8 the radius of well is treated as a line sink based on above assumptions the governing equations for groundwater flow within the confined aquifer and the aquitard respectively are 1 2 s 1 r 2 1 r s 1 r k 2 z k 1 m 1 s 2

fundamental to managing and evaluating groundwater resources and understanding local or regional hydrologic fluxes konikow and kendy 2005 konikow and neuzil 2007 from fig 1 one can easily find that the volume of pumped water from the confined aquifer is contributed by three parts one part is the depletion of groundwater stored in the confined aquifer i e aquifer depletion the second part is the groundwater leakage from the unconfined aquifer into the aquitard i e unconfined aquifer leakage while the third part is the depletion of groundwater stored in the aquitard i e aquitard depletion according to the expressions of aquifer and aquitard drawdown i e eqs 10 and 13 aquifer depletion v 1 unconfined aquifer leakage v e and aquitard depletion v 2 can be calculated as 14 v 1 t 0 2 π s 1

given time the sum of δ 1 δ e and δ 2 is equal to 1 when a d approaches zero expressions of δ 1 δ e and δ 2 are given in the electronic supplementary material see eqs s18 s20 which considers a constant aquitard hydraulic conductivity as that of hantush 1960 model currently the semi analytical solutions for well hydraulics and groundwater budget have been derived considering an exponentially decaying aquitard hydraulic conductivity but it seems to be impossible to implement inverse laplace transforms analytically for the above equations to obtain analytical solutions in the time domain on the contrary the numerical inverse laplace transform techniques are convenient and efficient to implement crump 1976 de hoog et al 1982 stehfest 1970a 1970b wang and zhan 2015 the stehfest 1970a algorithm one of the commonly used numerical inverse laplace transform methods has been widely shown to perform well in obtaining the time domain solutions for well hydraulics problems wen et al 2008a 2009 wen and wang 2013 therefore the stehfest 1970a method is employed for the calculations of well hydraulics and groundwater budget in this study 4 results 4 1 verification of the analytical solutions a synthetic pumping test conducted in a leaky aquifer system is considered the confined aquifer the main filling is sand fully penetrated by the pumping well has a thickness of m 1 160 and its hydraulic conductivity and storage coefficient are k 1 2 10 3 m s and s 1 1 6 10 2 respectively the aquitard the main filling is clay is set to be half as thick as the aquifer i e m 2 80 m and its storage coefficient is s 2 8 10 2 the hydraulic conductivity at the top of the aquitard is k 0 1 10 6 m s above values of involved hydraulic parameters are provided by referring to ferris et al 2020 ren and santamarina 2018 and konikow and neuzil 2007 which have compiled a large number of laboratory and field tests data the radial distance between the observation well and the pumping well is r 16 m thus the relevant dimensionless variables are calculated to be b d 2 1000 s d 5 and r d 0 1 to test the accuracy of the derived semi analytical solutions in this study the aquifer drawdown solution with a d 8 was compared to the numerical solution based on the finite difference method previously presented by li et al 2020 and wen et al 2009 where the corresponding differential equations can be solved by using the stiff integrator ode15s in matlab shampine and reichelt 1997 specifically a matlab program is developed for numerical simulations in particular the dimensionless radial distance and dimensionless vertical distance are logarithmically discretized into 501 and 41 nodes respectively the first and last values of 1 10 6 and 1 10 8 are respectively used to approximate the boundary conditions of r d 0 and r d the analytical solution of a single confined aquifer model theis 1935 was also provided for comparison as shown in fig 2 when considering an exponentially decaying aquitard hydraulic conductivity a d 8 our analytical solution agrees very well with the numerical solutions for the entire pumping period in addition when a d is large enough a d 18 which indicates a particularly small hydraulic conductivity at the bottom of the aquitard the analytical solution is also in good agreement with the theis 1935 solution the above two comparison results imply the correctness and validity of the semi analytical solutions derived in this study in the following section the effects of a d which is the most significant parameter describing the variation magnitude of aquitard hydraulic conductivity along the depth profile on well hydraulics and groundwater budget will be analyzed 4 2 effects of decay exponent a d on well hydraulics figs 2 and 3 show the effects of a d on aquifer and aquitard drawdowns in semi log scales respectively the time drawdown curve corresponding to the hantush 1960 model describes the drawdown characteristics where the aquitard hydraulic conductivity is vertically constant a d 0 in this case the aquitard hydraulic conductivity does not vary with depth and is always equal to the hydraulic conductivity at the top of the aquitard k 0 from the two figures one can find that a larger a d leads to a larger aquifer drawdown while a smaller drawdown is observed in the aquitard this is due to the fact that a larger a d results in a smaller hydraulic conductivity at the bottom of the aquitard thus it is more difficult for the aquitard to leak a certain amount of water to the confined aquifer resulting in a smaller aquitard drawdown and a larger aquifer drawdown one can also find that when a d is larger aquifer drawdown increases faster while aquitard drawdown increases slower at early times with the increase of the pumping time the aquifer and aquitard drawdowns tend to be constant at late times and a larger a d leads to a longer time for the aquifer and aquitard drawdowns to reach a steady state as explained previously a larger a d implies that it is more difficult for the aquitard to recharge the confined aquifer as a result it takes a longer time for aquifer and aquitard drawdown to reach a steady state in addition a closer look at fig 3 reveals that the aquitard may undergo a period of slightly accelerated increase in drawdown at intermediate times 10 0 t d 10 3 this phenomenon cannot happen for a homogenous aquitard i e the hantush 1960 model meanwhile we note that a larger a d results in a more obvious trend of such an acceleration fig 3 4 3 effects of decay exponent a d on groundwater budget fig 4 illustrates the effects of a d on the fractions of aquifer depletion δ 1 unconfined leakage δ e and aquitard depletion δ 2 the case considering the constant aquitard hydraulic conductivity i e the hantush 1960 model was also depicted as a reference comparing fig 4a to fig 4b one can find that δ 1 decreases rapidly at early times and then slowly approaches 0 at late times while δ e increases rapidly from 0 at early times and then slowly approaches 1 at late times this reflects that aquifer and aquitard depletions are the main sources of early time groundwater withdrawal with the increase of time δ 2 rapidly increases to approach 1 see fig 4c implying that late time groundwater withdrawal will be almost entirely contributed by the recharge from the unconfined aquifer by leakage through the aquitard for different a d one can find that a larger a d leads to a larger δ 1 while a smaller δ e at early to intermediate times this is also the reason why a larger a d results in a larger aquifer drawdown and a smaller aquitard drawdown as discussed in section 4 2 one can also find that for a larger a d it may require a longer time for aquifer depletion and unconfined aquifer leakage to reach a steady state from fig 4c one can observe that δ 2 rapidly increases with time and reaches a maximum at early to intermediate times then δ 2 gradually decreases and approaches 0 at late times this phenomenon can be explained as follows at early pumping times most of the extracted groundwater comes from aquifer depletion with the increase of pumping time aquifer drawdown penetrates upward to the aquitard resulting in the aquitard releasing water from storage to recharge the lower confined aquifer so δ 2 increases rapidly at early times when the aquifer drawdown penetrates into the upper unconfined aquifer the unconfined aquifer starts to recharge the depleted aquitard hence the growth rate of δ 2 slows down due to the limited thickness of the aquitard aquitard depletion is also limited so there exists a maximum value of δ 2 at early to intermediate times thereafter the fraction of unconfined aquifer leakage increases significantly and δ 2 begins to decrease it is worth noting that a larger a d results in a smaller maximum δ 2 and a later time for the aquitard to reach the maximum this is because a larger a d generally corresponds to smaller aquitard hydraulic conductivity thus the aquifer drawdown is more difficult to penetrate into the aquitard at a given time point resulting in a smaller aquitard drawdown meanwhile a larger a d means that it takes a longer time for the aquifer drawdown to penetrate through the aquitard so one can see a maximum δ 2 at a later time point fig 4c 4 4 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis is a very important and common method to evaluate the impact of slight changes in input parameters on output results feasible sensitivity analysis methods include those by huang and yeh 2007 kabala 2001 morris 1991 rakovec et al 2014 sobol 2001 etc to further analyze the effects of decay exponent a d on well hydraulics and groundwater budget the normalized sensitivity analysis method proposed by huang and yeh 2007 which has been commonly used in the field of well hydraulics problems is applied in this study the normalized sensitivity of a d is defined as 27 n i t d a d o i t d a d a d where n i t d is the normalized sensitivity of the i output function o i i e the dimensionless drawdown or groundwater budget to a d at dimensionless time t d note that when the objective function is relatively complex it is difficult to obtain the analytical expression of the normalized sensitivity thus a forward difference formula is applied to approximate the partial derivative and eq 27 can be rewritten as 28 n i t d a d o i t d a d δ a d o i t d a d δ a d where δ a d is a small increment which may be approximated by 10 2 a d the normalized sensitivities of the dimensionless aquifer drawdown s d 1 and dimensionless aquitard drawdown s d 2 with respect to a d are shown in fig 5 a b several interesting points can be seen from fig 5 firstly the increase of a d has a positive effect on s d 1 fig 5a while a negative effect on s d 2 fig 5b this is consistent with the transient drawdown features as shown in fig 2 and fig 3 secondly for the confined aquifer a larger a d results in a smaller drawdown sensitivity at early times and a larger drawdown sensitivity at late times for the aquitard drawdown a given a d produces the largest sensitivity in terms of magnitude hereinafter at early times it is found that when a d is relatively small e g a d 2 or 3 the largest sensitivity increases with a d however when a d is relatively large e g a d 4 5 6 7 or 8 the largest sensitivity decreases with a d this indicates that the overall largest sensitivity of aquitard drawdown to a d occurs at a a d value between 2 and 4 fig 5b in addition fig 5b shows that a relatively large a d e g a d 4 5 6 7 or 8 may result in a local minimum sensitivity at intermediate times and such a local minimum sensitivity may decrease with a d besides a significant increase in sensitivity may be found for a relatively large a d at intermediate times thirdly from fig 5 one can find that the sensitivities of the aquifer or aquitard drawdown to a d will reach a constant value at late times and a larger a d will result in a long time to reach this constant value fig 6 provides the normalized sensitivities of groundwater budget i e the fractions of aquifer depletion δ 1 unconfined leakage δ e and aquitard depletion δ 2 to a d as shown in fig 6a b a relative increase in a d has a positive effect on δ 1 while a negative effect on δ e besides one can see that the sensitivities of δ 1 and δ e to a d reach the largest values at early to intermediate times and then stabilize at zero after a relatively long time besides the largest sensitivity values of δ 1 and δ e consistently increase with a d by comparing fig 6 a with fig 6c one can find that the sensitivities of δ 1 and δ 2 to a d are quite different specifically fig 6c illustrates that δ 2 is negatively sensitive to a d at early times and is positively sensitive to a d at intermediate times besides a relatively large a d can produce two local largest sensitivity in terms of magnitude values at early and intermediate times furthermore the two local largest sensitivity values consistently increase with a d the above sensitivity analysis results indicate that the components of the groundwater budget i e aquifer depletion unconfined aquifer leakage and aquitard depletion are highly sensitive to the decay exponent a d at early and intermediate times indicating the importance of vertical aquitard heterogeneity in the evaluation of groundwater resources 4 5 homogeneous aquitard with different mean values of depth decaying aquitard hydraulic conductivity previous studies regarding the calculations of aquitard depletion based on an analytical model usually assumed that the aquitard is vertically homogeneous in hydraulic properties konikow and neuzil 2007 li et al 2017 however previous investigations have shown that aquitard hydraulic conductivity could have a significant trend of exponential decay with burial depth e g ferris et al 2020 our theoretical analysis also suggests the critical effects of the decay exponent on the groundwater budget therefore using a mean value of depth decaying aquitard hydraulic conductivity to conduct the evaluation of groundwater budget may be unreasonable and could potentially result in great bias one question raised here is that if one chooses to assess the groundwater budget by considering a vertically heterogeneous aquitard to be an equivalent homogeneous one which mean value of the realistic exponentially decaying aquitard hydraulic conductivity is more representative of actual conditions fig 7 shows the calculated fractions of groundwater withdrawal with harmonic mean geometric mean and arithmetic mean of dimensionless aquitard hydraulic conductivity which are calculated to be 0 0337 0 0821 and 0 2002 respectively the real situation of exponentially decaying aquitard hydraulic conductivity blue curve is also provided as a reference from fig 7a and fig 7c one can find that the late time features of δ 1 can be captured by the harmonic mean value while the late time features of δ 2 can be captured by the geometric mean value besides it seems that the δ e corresponding to geometric mean is closer to the blue curve at late times fig 7b fig 7 suggests that if one conducts the evaluation of groundwater budget based on a homogeneous leaky aquifer model the harmonic mean value of an exponentially decaying aquitard hydraulic conductivity is most suitable to estimate the final aquifer depletion but the geometric mean value should be used to estimate aquitard depletion and unconfined aquifer leakage it is worth noting that either using the harmonic mean the geometric mean or the arithmetic mean of the exponentially decaying aquitard hydraulic conductivity to estimate early time aquifer depletion unconfined aquifer leakage and aquitard depletion would result in significant bias fig 7 this indicates that at early times of pumping aquifer depletion unconfined aquifer leakage and aquitard depletion are greatly affected by the heterogeneity of aquitard hydraulic conductivity one can also find that the arithmetic mean value cannot be used to estimate the groundwater budget throughout the entire pumping history 5 discussion it should be pointed out that some idealized assumptions that have been commonly employed in the field of well hydraulics were also adopted in this analytical study for example the hydraulic head of the unconfined aquifer is assumed to remain constant during pumping one should realize that visible drawdown could also occur in the unconfined aquifer especially when the pumping rate is particularly large or when the hydraulic conductivity and specific yield of the unconfined aquifer are rather small so that the unconfined aquifer cannot receive rapid and sufficient recharge or release a considerable amount of water from storage to mitigate the drawdown a more sophisticated analytical model that considers the drawdown in the unconfined aquifer might need to be developed for further investigations in addition the aquifer hydraulic conductivity is assumed to be independent of depth this assumption may not be able to fully describe some aquifers with a large thickness of hundreds to thousands of meters where the decreasing trend of aquifer hydraulic conductivity with depth cannot be ignored chen et al 2020 jiang et al 2010 sakata and ikeda 2013 if the depth decaying hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer has to be also considered a sophisticated three dimensional well hydraulics model must be developed and new mathematical approaches need to be developed to obtain corresponding analytical solutions at least the numerical simulation technique seems to be acceptable in dealing with the vertical heterogeneity of both the aquifer and aquitard however for an ideally sandy or gravelly aquifer that is tens of meters thick a relatively small decay exponent usually at a magnitude of 10 2 to 10 4 m 1 will lead to a slightly varying hydraulic conductivity along the depth profile thus it is reasonable to assume an approximately homogeneous aquifer for the analytical model developed in this study in other words the slight decrease in the hydraulic conductivity for a tens of meters thick aquifer appears to have a negligible impact on related theoretical analysis results besides the aquitard hydraulic conductivity can be time varying the main reason is that groundwater exploitation leads to pore water pressure declines in the aquitard causing the aquitard to compact and further leading to the changes in porosity hydraulic conductivity and other physical parameters e g ouria et al 2009 galloway and burbey 2011 yang et al 2015 therefore a careful consideration of time varing aquitard hydraulic properties including the hydraulic conductivity is necessary for the assessment of groundwater resources in the areas associated with long term groundwater exploitation numerical modeling considering spatiotemporal aquitard hydraulic conductivity needs further investigation another simplification that needs to be concerned is that the specific storage of both the aquifer and the aquitard is assumed to be depth independent in reality not only the hydraulic conductivity but also the specific storage has been shown to vary with depth liu et al 2007 contoux et al 2013 kuang et al 2020 2021 paradis and lefebvre 2013 shestakov 2002 for example shestakov 2002 summarized published data and field experiments and obtained the relationship between specific storage and depth of sandy and clay formations kuang et al 2021 collected field specific storage depth data from the literature and proposed an empirical model that describes the decreasing trend of specific storage with depth it seems that considering the variation in specific storage with depth is also very essential for accurate groundwater resource evaluation and management kuang et al 2021 further studies on the effects of depth varying aquitard specific storage on well hydraulics and groundwater budget are also recommended finally although the semi analytical solution for well hydraulics within a classical three layer leaky aquifer system has been obtained considering the depth decaying aquitard hydraulic conductivity the model has not been applied to field data due to the lack of in situ pumping tests and hydrogeological investigation data that matches the situation considered in this study therefore such investigations should be conducted in the future moreover potential parameter estimation methods e g conventional type curve methods based on the newly developed analytical model might be further proposed although the above problems remain unsolved the newly developed analytical model together with the theoretical analysis results provide important theoretical insights and can greatly improve the interpretation of in situ groundwater level variation data and evaluation of groundwater budgets in aquifer and aquitard units 6 summary and conclusions in this study well hydraulics i e aquifer and aquitard drawdowns and groundwater budget i e fractions of aquifer depletion unconfined aquifer leakage and aquitard depletion in the cumulative groundwater withdrawal in a leaky aquifer system considering exponentially decaying aquitard hydraulic conductivity were investigated relevant semi analytical solutions were derived using the laplace transform and hankel transform techniques the effects of the decay exponent of aquitard hydraulic conductivity a d on well hydraulics and groundwater budget were theoretically analyzed accompanied by a sensitivity analysis major conclusions drawn from this study are as follows 1 a larger a d consistently leads to a larger aquifer drawdown while a smaller aquitard drawdown and results in a longer time for the well hydraulics to reach the steady state the aquitard drawdown may undergo a period of slightly accelerating increase at intermediate pumping times and a larger a d results in a more obvious trend of such an accelerating increase 2 a larger a d consistently leads to a larger fraction of aquifer depletion as well as a smaller fraction of unconfined aquifer leakage in the cumulative groundwater withdrawal the fraction of aquitard depletion rapidly increases with time and reaches a maximum at early to intermediate pumping times and a larger a d results in a smaller maximum and a later time to reach the maximum 3 for the confined aquifer a larger a d results in a smaller drawdown sensitivity to a d at early times and a larger drawdown sensitivity at late times for the aquitard a d produces the largest sensitivity in terms of magnitude at early times and there must exist a specific a d value that makes the largest sensitivity reach the overall maximum a relatively large a d may result in a local minimum sensitivity of aquitard drawdown to a d at intermediate times and such a local minimum sensitivity may decrease with a d 4 an increase in a d has a positive effect on the fraction of aquifer depletion while a negative effect on the fraction of unconfined aquifer leakage the sensitivities of the fractions of aquifer depletion and unconfined aquifer leakage to a d reach the maximum values at early to intermediate times and the largest sensitivity values increase with a d for the fraction of aquitard depletion a d has a negative effect at early times while a positive effect at intermediate times a relatively large a d can produce two local largest sensitivities in terms of magnitude at early and intermediate times respectively 5 for the calculation of groundwater budget based on a homogeneous model a reasonable mean value of the exponentially decaying aquitard hydraulic conductivity should be adopted our investigation revealed that the harmonic mean value can better estimate the final aquifer depletion while the geometric mean value can better estimate the final aquitard depletion the arithmetic mean value is not suitable to conduct the evaluation of groundwater resources credit authorship contribution statement chao zhuang conceptualization data curation formal

aquifer drawdown s d 1 can be firstly obtained by taking the aquifer drawdown as the boundary condition of the aquitard and then the aquifer drawdown can be determined by substituting the expression of aquitard drawdown into the governing equation for groundwater flow within the confined aquifer the derivation process of the analytical solution to eq 7 i e the dimensionless aquitard drawdown is presented as follows by introducing u d e a d z d eq 7 can be transformed to a1 u d 2 s d 2 u d 2 1 a d 2 s d 2 t d where a d is not equal to 0 applying the laplace transform to eq a1 one can obtain

combining the boundary conditions eqs a11a and a11b and further substituting η p a d into eq a10 yields the explicit expression of s d 2 in the laplace domain as a12 s d 2 r d z d p φ 1 2 ψ 2 2 0 s d

dimensionless drawdown of the aquitard in the laplace domain the analytical solution to eq 6 for the dimensionless drawdown of the confined aquifer is presented in the following taking the partial

larger a d consistently leads to a larger aquifer drawdown a smaller aquitard drawdown a larger fraction of aquifer depletion and a smaller fraction of leakage from the unconfined aquifer sensitivity analysis results also indicated critical effects of a d on well hydraulics and groundwater budget comparative analysis revealed that none of the three typical mean values of depth decaying aquitard k can perfectly characterize the well hydraulics and groundwater budget from early to intermediate times however the harmonic and geometric mean values can be feasibly used to calculate the final fractions of aquifer depletion and aquitard depletion at late times respectively limitations of the newly developed analytical model have also been discussed practical investigations of vertical

hydrogeological parameters in the investigations of well hydraulics in groundwater hydrology demir et al 2017 kazakis et al 2016 lai and ren 2016 for a hydrogeological unit e g an aquifer or an aquitard k is frequently regarded as a constant in space luo and illman 2016 zhuang et al 2020 however many studies have shown that k is sensitive to the slight change in porosity asfahani 2017 koltermann and gorelick 1995 yamaguchi and nakamura 1994 from the perspective of soil deposition the porosity of a hydrogeological unit usually decreases with the burial depth due to the compaction or other physical and chemical effects resulting in an obvious variation of k along the depth profile chen et al 2020 jiang et al 2010 kuang and jiao 2014 sakata and ikeda 2013 a depth dependent k usually manifests as a large scale hydraulic conductivity heterogeneity which has been widely observed in geologic media e g achtziger zupancic et al 2017 cardenas and jiang 2010 chen et al 2018 2021

al 2011 saar and manga 2004 sakata 2015 sakata and ikeda 2013 for instance chen et al 2018 collected 13 397 k measurements through borehole packer tests at 12 dam sites in southwest china and found that the k of igneous and metamorphic rocks follows a power law relationship decreasing with depth achtziger zupancic et al 2017 also found that the decreasing pattern of k versus the depth for crystalline rocks basically follows a power law function after compiling 29 000 in situ data from 221 publications and reports besides many studies also showed that k could exponentially decay with depth and the decay exponent varies from 1 10 2 to 1 10 4 m 1 at some specific locations luo et al 2011 manning and ingebritsen 1999 saar and manga 2004 wang et al 2009 considering the effect of an exponentially decaying k with depth jiang et al 2009 found that the decay exponent would significantly affect the development of local versus regional flow systems subsequently jiang et al 2011 obtained analytical solutions for head and stream functions in basins with depth decaying k where the decay exponent varied from 0 to 0 008 m 1 and then discussed the positions of stagnation points and the dynamic characteristic of groundwater flow around the stagnation points sakata and ikeda 2013 found that the monotonic gravelly aquifer within the toyohira river alluvial fan sapporo japan demonstrated a depth decaying k with a decay exponent of approximately 0 11 m 1 for a depth profile from the surface down to 30 m depth and such a relatively large decay exponent value was mainly attributed to the depth varying contents of fine grained sediments within the pore space of gravel particles many previous studies have considered that k of an aquifer could exponentially decrease with depth to consider the larger compressibility leake 1990 li et al 2019 and comparative thickness bredehoeft et al 1983 hendry et al 1991 neuzil 1995 zhuang et al 2015 2020 of silty and clayey aquitard layers in real hydrogeological investigations compared with sandy aquifers the aquitard k may show more obvious features of depth dependence under lithostatic stress ferris et al 2020 collected the hydrogeological data of the pleistocene aged till aquitard at 15 sites of the south central region of saskatchewan canada which were sorted out by 21 studies and found that the aquitard k did show an obvious exponentially decaying trend with depth the decay exponent is approximately 0 15 m 1 and the range of k variation reached five orders of magnitude within a depth of 80 m other studies also indicated that the variability and scale dependence of k in some shallow aquitards were especially significant hendry 1988 keller et al 1989 schulze makuch et al 1999 van der kamp 2001 the above evidences suggest that the depth decaying aquitard k cannot be ignored and may have significant effects on the dynamics of groundwater level and on the evaluation of groundwater resources during groundwater exploitation however most investigations regarding leaky aquifer systems typically have assumed that the aquitard k is spatially constant e g hantush 1960 konikow and neuzil 2007 neuman and witherspoon 1972 wen et al 2008b to the best of our knowledge there are few studies considering the depth decaying aquitard k in the investigations of well hydraulics in this study we will first derive the semi analytical solutions of well hydraulics i e pumping induced aquifer and aquitard drawdown where the aquitard k is considered to exponentially decay with burial depth secondly the solutions will be further used to explore the drawdown characteristics and to evaluate the groundwater budget i e the aquifer depletion the leakage from the unconfined aquifer to the aquitard and the aquitard depletion thirdly sensitivity analysis of well hydraulics and groundwater budget to the decay exponent will be conducted finally the groundwater budget corresponding to an exponentially decaying aquitard k will be compared to those based on different scenarios of mean aquitard k 2 mathematical model 2 1 governing equations consider the classical three layer aquifer aquitard system undergoing constant rate pumping water from a fully penetrated well as shown in fig 1 to conduct an analytical analysis some assumptions are introduced as follows 1 both the aquifer and aquitard are infinitely extensive and with a uniform thickness 2 the pumped confined aquifer is homogeneous and isotropic while the aquitard is heterogeneous as its hydraulic conductivity exponentially decays with burial depth but is isotropic 3 the flow in the confined aquifer is horizontal while the flow in the aquitard is vertical 4 the flow in both the confined aquifer and aquitard obeys darcy s law 5 the entire aquifer aquitard system is initially static 6 the hydraulic head of the unconfined aquifer remains constant during pumping 7 groundwater flow is transient in all units and 8 the radius of well is treated as a line sink based on above assumptions the governing equations for groundwater flow within the confined aquifer and the aquitard respectively are 1 2 s 1 r 2 1 r s 1 r k 2 z k 1 m 1 s 2

result of eq 10 approaches the hantush 1960 solution in the laplace domain eqs s16 and s17 in the electronic supplementary material 3 2 groundwater budget an accurate budget of groundwater is fundamental to managing and evaluating groundwater resources and understanding local or regional hydrologic fluxes konikow and kendy 2005 konikow and neuzil 2007 from fig 1 one can easily find that the volume of pumped water from the confined aquifer is contributed by three parts one part is the depletion of groundwater stored in the confined aquifer i e aquifer depletion the second part is the groundwater leakage from the unconfined aquifer into the aquitard i e unconfined aquifer leakage while the third part is the depletion of groundwater stored in the aquitard i e aquitard depletion according to the expressions of aquifer and aquitard drawdown i e eqs 10 and 13 aquifer depletion v 1 unconfined aquifer leakage v e and aquitard depletion v 2 can be calculated as 14 v 1 t 0 2 π s 1

given time the sum of δ 1 δ e and δ 2 is equal to 1 when a d approaches zero expressions of δ 1 δ e and δ 2 are given in the electronic supplementary material see eqs s18 s20 which considers a constant aquitard hydraulic conductivity as that of hantush 1960 model currently the semi analytical solutions for well hydraulics and groundwater budget have been derived considering an exponentially decaying aquitard hydraulic conductivity but it seems to be impossible to implement inverse laplace transforms analytically for the above equations to obtain analytical solutions in the time domain on the contrary the numerical inverse laplace transform techniques are convenient and efficient to implement crump 1976 de hoog et al 1982 stehfest 1970a 1970b wang and zhan 2015 the stehfest 1970a algorithm one of the commonly used numerical inverse laplace transform methods has been widely shown to perform well in obtaining the time domain solutions for well hydraulics problems wen et al 2008a 2009 wen and wang 2013 therefore the stehfest 1970a method is employed for the calculations of well hydraulics and groundwater budget in this study 4 results 4 1 verification of the analytical solutions a synthetic pumping test conducted in a leaky aquifer system is considered the confined aquifer the main filling is sand fully penetrated by the pumping well has a thickness of m 1 160 and its hydraulic conductivity and storage coefficient are k 1 2 10 3 m s and s 1 1 6 10 2 respectively the aquitard the main filling is clay is set to be half as thick as the aquifer i e m 2 80 m and its storage coefficient is s 2 8 10 2 the hydraulic conductivity at the top of the aquitard is k 0 1 10 6 m s above values of involved hydraulic parameters are provided by referring to ferris et al 2020 ren and santamarina 2018 and konikow and neuzil 2007 which have compiled a large number of laboratory and field tests data the radial distance between the observation well and the pumping well is r 16 m thus the relevant dimensionless variables are calculated to be b d 2 1000 s d 5 and r d 0 1 to test the accuracy of the derived semi analytical solutions in this study the aquifer drawdown solution with a d 8 was compared to the numerical solution based on the finite difference method previously presented by li et al 2020 and wen et al 2009 where the corresponding differential equations can be solved by using the stiff integrator ode15s in matlab shampine and reichelt 1997 specifically a matlab program is developed for numerical simulations in particular the dimensionless radial distance and dimensionless vertical distance are logarithmically discretized into 501 and 41 nodes respectively the first and last values of 1 10 6 and 1 10 8 are respectively used to approximate the boundary conditions of r d 0 and r d the analytical solution of a single confined aquifer model theis 1935 was also provided for comparison as shown in fig 2 when considering an exponentially decaying aquitard hydraulic conductivity a d 8 our analytical solution agrees very well with the numerical solutions for the entire pumping period in addition when a d is large enough a d 18 which indicates a particularly small hydraulic conductivity at the bottom of the aquitard the analytical solution is also in good agreement with the theis 1935 solution the above two comparison results imply the correctness and validity of the semi analytical solutions derived in this study in the following section the effects of a d which is the most significant parameter describing the variation magnitude of aquitard hydraulic conductivity along the depth profile on well hydraulics and groundwater budget will be analyzed 4 2 effects of decay exponent a d on well hydraulics figs 2 and 3 show the effects of a d on aquifer and aquitard drawdowns in semi log scales respectively the time drawdown curve corresponding to the hantush 1960 model describes the drawdown characteristics where the aquitard hydraulic conductivity is vertically constant a d 0 in this case the aquitard hydraulic conductivity does not vary with depth and is always equal to the hydraulic conductivity at the top of the aquitard k 0 from the two figures one can find that a larger a d leads to a larger aquifer drawdown while a smaller drawdown is observed in the aquitard this is due to the fact that a larger a d results in a smaller hydraulic conductivity at the bottom of the aquitard thus it is more difficult for the aquitard to leak a certain amount of water to the confined aquifer resulting in a smaller aquitard drawdown and a larger aquifer drawdown one can also find that when a d is larger aquifer drawdown increases faster while aquitard drawdown increases slower at early times with the increase of the pumping time the aquifer and aquitard drawdowns tend to be constant at late times and a larger a d leads to a longer time for the aquifer and aquitard drawdowns to reach a steady state as explained previously a larger a d implies that it is more difficult for the aquitard to recharge the confined aquifer as a result it takes a longer time for aquifer and aquitard drawdown to reach a steady state in addition a closer look at fig 3 reveals that the aquitard may undergo a period of slightly accelerated increase in drawdown at intermediate times 10 0 t d 10 3 this phenomenon cannot happen for a homogenous aquitard i e the hantush 1960 model meanwhile we note that a larger a d results in a more obvious trend of such an acceleration fig 3 4 3 effects of decay exponent a d on groundwater budget fig 4 illustrates the effects of a d on the fractions of aquifer depletion δ 1 unconfined leakage δ e and aquitard depletion δ 2 the case considering the constant aquitard hydraulic conductivity i e the hantush 1960 model was also depicted as a reference comparing fig 4a to fig 4b one can find that δ 1 decreases rapidly at early times and then slowly approaches 0 at late times while δ e increases rapidly from 0 at early times and then slowly approaches 1 at late times this reflects that aquifer and aquitard depletions are the main sources of early time groundwater withdrawal with the increase of time δ 2 rapidly increases to approach 1 see fig 4c implying that late time groundwater withdrawal will be almost entirely contributed by the recharge from the unconfined aquifer by leakage through the aquitard for different a d one can find that a larger a d leads to a larger δ 1 while a smaller δ e at early to intermediate times this is also the reason why a larger a d results in a larger aquifer drawdown and a smaller aquitard drawdown as discussed in section 4 2 one can also find that for a larger a d it may require a longer time for aquifer depletion and unconfined aquifer leakage to reach a steady state from fig 4c one can observe that δ 2 rapidly increases with time and reaches a maximum at early to intermediate times then δ 2 gradually decreases and approaches 0 at late times this phenomenon can be explained as follows at early pumping times most of the extracted groundwater comes from aquifer depletion with the increase of pumping time aquifer drawdown penetrates upward to the aquitard resulting in the aquitard releasing water from storage to recharge the lower confined aquifer so δ 2 increases rapidly at early times when the aquifer drawdown penetrates into the upper unconfined aquifer the unconfined aquifer starts to recharge the depleted aquitard hence the growth rate of δ 2 slows down due to the limited thickness of the aquitard aquitard depletion is also limited so there exists a maximum value of δ 2 at early to intermediate times thereafter the fraction of unconfined aquifer leakage increases significantly and δ 2 begins to decrease it is worth noting that a larger a d results in a smaller maximum δ 2 and a later time for the aquitard to reach the maximum this is because a larger a d generally corresponds to smaller aquitard hydraulic conductivity thus the aquifer drawdown is more difficult to penetrate into the aquitard at a given time point resulting in a smaller aquitard drawdown meanwhile a larger a d means that it takes a longer time for the aquifer drawdown to penetrate through the aquitard so one can see a maximum δ 2 at a later time point fig 4c 4 4 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis is a very important and common method to evaluate the impact of slight changes in input parameters on output results feasible sensitivity analysis methods include those by huang and yeh 2007 kabala 2001 morris 1991 rakovec et al 2014 sobol 2001 etc to further analyze the effects of decay exponent a d on well hydraulics and groundwater budget the normalized sensitivity analysis method proposed by huang and yeh 2007 which has been commonly used in the field of well hydraulics problems is applied in this study the normalized sensitivity of a d is defined as 27 n i t d a d o i t d a d a d where n i t d is the normalized sensitivity of the i output function o i i e the dimensionless drawdown or groundwater budget to a d at dimensionless time t d note that when the objective function is relatively complex it is difficult to obtain the analytical expression of the normalized sensitivity thus a forward difference formula is applied to approximate the partial derivative and eq 27 can be rewritten as 28 n i t d a d o i t d a d δ a d o i t d a d δ a d where δ a d is a small increment which may be approximated by 10 2 a d the normalized sensitivities of the dimensionless aquifer drawdown s d 1 and dimensionless aquitard drawdown s d 2 with respect to a d are shown in fig 5 a b several interesting points can be seen from fig 5 firstly the increase of a d has a positive effect on s d 1 fig 5a while a negative effect on s d 2 fig 5b this is consistent with the transient drawdown features as shown in fig 2 and fig 3 secondly for the confined aquifer a larger a d results in a smaller drawdown sensitivity at early times and a larger drawdown sensitivity at late times for the aquitard drawdown a given a d produces the largest sensitivity in terms of magnitude hereinafter at early times it is found that when a d is relatively small e g a d 2 or 3 the largest sensitivity increases with a d however when a d is relatively large e g a d 4 5 6 7 or 8 the largest sensitivity decreases with a d this indicates that the overall largest sensitivity of aquitard drawdown to a d occurs at a a d value between 2 and 4 fig 5b in addition fig 5b shows that a relatively large a d e g a d 4 5 6 7 or 8 may result in a local minimum sensitivity at intermediate times and such a local minimum sensitivity may decrease with a d besides a significant increase in sensitivity may be found for a relatively large a d at intermediate times thirdly from fig 5 one can find that the sensitivities of the aquifer or aquitard drawdown to a d will reach a constant value at late times and a larger a d will result in a long time to reach this constant value fig 6 provides the normalized sensitivities of groundwater budget i e the fractions of aquifer depletion δ 1 unconfined leakage δ e and aquitard depletion δ 2 to a d as shown in fig 6a b a relative increase in a d has a positive effect on δ 1 while a negative effect on δ e besides one can see that the sensitivities of δ 1 and δ e to a d reach the largest values at early to intermediate times and then stabilize at zero after a relatively long time besides the largest sensitivity values of δ 1 and δ e consistently increase with a d by comparing fig 6 a with fig 6c one can find that the sensitivities of δ 1 and δ 2 to a d are quite different specifically fig 6c illustrates that δ 2 is negatively sensitive to a d at early times and is positively sensitive to a d at intermediate times besides a relatively large a d can produce two local largest sensitivity in terms of magnitude values at early and intermediate times furthermore the two local largest sensitivity values consistently increase with a d the above sensitivity analysis results indicate that the components of the groundwater budget i e aquifer depletion unconfined aquifer leakage and aquitard depletion are highly sensitive to the decay exponent a d at early and intermediate times indicating the importance of vertical aquitard heterogeneity in the evaluation of groundwater resources 4 5 homogeneous aquitard with different mean values of depth decaying aquitard hydraulic conductivity previous studies regarding the calculations of aquitard depletion based on an analytical model usually assumed that the aquitard is vertically homogeneous in hydraulic properties konikow and neuzil 2007 li et al 2017 however previous investigations have shown that aquitard hydraulic conductivity could have a significant trend of exponential decay with burial depth e g ferris et al 2020 our theoretical analysis also suggests the critical effects of the decay exponent on the groundwater budget therefore using a mean value of depth decaying aquitard hydraulic conductivity to conduct the evaluation of groundwater budget may be unreasonable and could potentially result in great bias one question raised here is that if one chooses to assess the groundwater budget by considering a vertically heterogeneous aquitard to be an equivalent homogeneous one which mean value of the realistic exponentially decaying aquitard hydraulic conductivity is more representative of actual conditions fig 7 shows the calculated fractions of groundwater withdrawal with harmonic mean geometric mean and arithmetic mean of dimensionless aquitard hydraulic conductivity which are calculated to be 0 0337 0 0821 and 0 2002 respectively the real situation of exponentially decaying aquitard hydraulic conductivity blue curve is also provided as a reference from fig 7a and fig 7c one can find that the late time features of δ 1 can be captured by the harmonic mean value while the late time features of δ 2 can be captured by the geometric mean value besides it seems that the δ e corresponding to geometric mean is closer to the blue curve at late times fig 7b fig 7 suggests that if one conducts the evaluation of groundwater budget based on a homogeneous leaky aquifer model the harmonic mean value of an exponentially decaying aquitard hydraulic conductivity is most suitable to estimate the final aquifer depletion but the geometric mean value should be used to estimate aquitard depletion and unconfined aquifer leakage it is worth noting that either using the harmonic mean the geometric mean or the arithmetic mean of the exponentially decaying aquitard hydraulic conductivity to estimate early time aquifer depletion unconfined aquifer leakage and aquitard depletion would result in significant bias fig 7 this indicates that at early times of pumping aquifer depletion unconfined aquifer leakage and aquitard depletion are greatly affected by the heterogeneity of aquitard hydraulic conductivity one can also find that the arithmetic mean value cannot be used to estimate the groundwater budget throughout the entire pumping history 5 discussion it should be pointed out that some idealized assumptions that have been commonly employed in the field of well hydraulics were also adopted in this analytical study for example the hydraulic head of the unconfined aquifer is assumed to remain constant during pumping one should realize that visible drawdown could also occur in the unconfined aquifer especially when the pumping rate is particularly large or when the hydraulic conductivity and specific yield of the unconfined aquifer are rather small so that the unconfined aquifer cannot receive rapid and sufficient recharge or release a considerable amount of water from storage to mitigate the drawdown a more sophisticated analytical model that considers the drawdown in the unconfined aquifer might need to be developed for further investigations in addition the aquifer hydraulic conductivity is assumed to be independent of depth this assumption may not be able to fully describe some aquifers with a large thickness of hundreds to thousands of meters where the decreasing trend of aquifer hydraulic conductivity with depth cannot be ignored chen et al 2020 jiang et al 2010 sakata and ikeda 2013 if the depth decaying hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer has to be also considered a sophisticated three dimensional well hydraulics model must be developed and new mathematical approaches need to be developed to obtain corresponding analytical solutions at least the numerical simulation technique seems to be acceptable in dealing with the vertical heterogeneity of both the aquifer and aquitard however for an ideally sandy or gravelly aquifer that is tens of meters thick a relatively small decay exponent usually at a magnitude of 10 2 to 10 4 m 1 will lead to a slightly varying hydraulic conductivity along the depth profile thus it is reasonable to assume an approximately homogeneous aquifer for the analytical model developed in this study in other words the slight decrease in the hydraulic conductivity for a tens of meters thick aquifer appears to have a negligible impact on related theoretical analysis results besides the aquitard hydraulic conductivity can be time varying the main reason is that groundwater exploitation leads to pore water pressure declines in the aquitard causing the aquitard to compact and further leading to the changes in porosity hydraulic conductivity and other physical parameters e g ouria et al 2009 galloway and burbey 2011 yang et al 2015 therefore a careful consideration of time varing aquitard hydraulic properties including the hydraulic conductivity is necessary for the assessment of groundwater resources in the areas associated with long term groundwater exploitation numerical modeling considering spatiotemporal aquitard hydraulic conductivity needs further investigation another simplification that needs to be concerned is that the specific storage of both the aquifer and the aquitard is assumed to be depth independent in reality not only the hydraulic conductivity but also the specific storage has been shown to vary with depth liu et al 2007 contoux et al 2013 kuang et al 2020 2021 paradis and lefebvre 2013 shestakov 2002 for example shestakov 2002 summarized published data and field experiments and obtained the relationship between specific storage and depth of sandy and clay formations kuang et al 2021 collected field specific storage depth data from the literature and proposed an empirical model that describes the decreasing trend of specific storage with depth it seems that considering the variation in specific storage with depth is also very essential for accurate groundwater resource evaluation and management kuang et al 2021 further studies on the effects of depth varying aquitard specific storage on well hydraulics and groundwater budget are also recommended finally although the semi analytical solution for well hydraulics within a classical three layer leaky aquifer system has been obtained considering the depth decaying aquitard hydraulic conductivity the model has not been applied to field data due to the lack of in situ pumping tests and hydrogeological investigation data that matches the situation considered in this study therefore such investigations should be conducted in the future moreover potential parameter estimation methods e g conventional type curve methods based on the newly developed analytical model might be further proposed although the above problems remain unsolved the newly developed analytical model together with the theoretical analysis results provide important theoretical insights and can greatly improve the interpretation of in situ groundwater level variation data and evaluation of groundwater budgets in aquifer and aquitard units 6 summary and conclusions in this study well hydraulics i e aquifer and aquitard drawdowns and groundwater budget i e fractions of aquifer depletion unconfined aquifer leakage and aquitard depletion in the cumulative groundwater withdrawal in a leaky aquifer system considering exponentially decaying aquitard hydraulic conductivity were investigated relevant semi analytical solutions were derived using the laplace transform and hankel transform techniques the effects of the decay exponent of aquitard hydraulic conductivity a d on well hydraulics and groundwater budget were theoretically analyzed accompanied by a sensitivity analysis major conclusions drawn from this study are as follows 1 a larger a d consistently leads to a larger aquifer drawdown while a smaller aquitard drawdown and results in a longer time for the well hydraulics to reach the steady state the aquitard drawdown may undergo a period of slightly accelerating increase at intermediate pumping times and a larger a d results in a more obvious trend of such an accelerating increase 2 a larger a d consistently leads to a larger fraction of aquifer depletion as well as a smaller fraction of unconfined aquifer leakage in the cumulative groundwater withdrawal the fraction of aquitard depletion rapidly increases with time and reaches a maximum at early to intermediate pumping times and a larger a d results in a smaller maximum and a later time to reach the maximum 3 for the confined aquifer a larger a d results in a smaller drawdown sensitivity to a d at early times and a larger drawdown sensitivity at late times for the aquitard a d produces the largest sensitivity in terms of magnitude at early times and there must exist a specific a d value that makes the largest sensitivity reach the overall maximum a relatively large a d may result in a local minimum sensitivity of aquitard drawdown to a d at intermediate times and such a local minimum sensitivity may decrease with a d 4 an increase in a d has a positive effect on the fraction of aquifer depletion while a negative effect on the fraction of unconfined aquifer leakage the sensitivities of the fractions of aquifer depletion and unconfined aquifer leakage to a d reach the maximum values at early to intermediate times and the largest sensitivity values increase with a d for the fraction of aquitard depletion a d has a negative effect at early times while a positive effect at intermediate times a relatively large a d can produce two local largest sensitivities in terms of magnitude at early and intermediate times respectively 5 for the calculation of groundwater budget based on a homogeneous model a reasonable mean value of the exponentially decaying aquitard hydraulic conductivity should be adopted our investigation revealed that the harmonic mean value can better estimate the final aquifer depletion while the geometric mean value can better estimate the final aquitard depletion the arithmetic mean value is not suitable to conduct the evaluation of groundwater resources credit authorship contribution statement chao zhuang conceptualization data curation formal

aquifer drawdown s d 1 can be firstly obtained by taking the aquifer drawdown as the boundary condition of the aquitard and then the aquifer drawdown can be determined by substituting the expression of aquitard drawdown into the governing equation for groundwater flow within the confined aquifer the derivation process of the analytical solution to eq 7 i e the dimensionless aquitard drawdown is presented as follows by introducing u d e a d z d eq 7 can be transformed to a1 u d 2 s d 2 u d 2 1 a d 2 s d 2 t d where a d is not equal to 0 applying the laplace transform to eq a1 one can obtain the following ordinary differential equation a2 u d 2 s d 2 u d 2 η 2 s d 2 0 where η p a d overbar means the parameters in the laplace domain and p is the laplace variable with respect to the dimensionless time t d to introduce a3a s d 2 v w u d w u d a3b w u d w 0 u d 1 2 a3c w 0 2 i η where i 1 now involved terms are expressed in complex form from eqs 3a and 3b the partial derivatives of

consequently the second partial derivative of s d 2 with respect to u d is a6 2 s d 2 u d 2 1 2 w 0 2 2 v w 2 w u d 1 2 w 0 u d 1 2 v w w u d 1 4 w 0 v u d 3 2 substituting eq a4b into eq a6 yields a7

equation and its general solution is a9 v c 1 j 1 w c 2 y 1 w where j 1 and y 1 are respectively the first and second kind bessel functions of order one and c 1 and c 2 are constants that have to be further determined by applying boundary conditions of the aquitard substituting eqs a3b a3c and eq a7 into eq a3a s d 2 can be expressed as a10 s d 2 z d p 2 i η e a d z d 2 c 1 j 1 2 i η e a d z d 2 c 2 y 1 2 i η e a d z d 2 according to eqs 9b and 9c the boundary conditions for the aquitard after applying the laplace transform can be changed to a11a s d 2 r d 0 p 0 a11b s d 2 r d 1 p s d 1 r d p combining the boundary conditions eqs a11a and a11b and further substituting η p a d into eq a10 yields the explicit expression of s d 2 in the laplace domain as a12 s d 2 r d z d p φ 1 2 ψ 2 2 0 s d

dimensionless drawdown of the aquitard in the laplace domain the analytical solution to eq 6 for the dimensionless drawdown of the confined aquifer is presented in the following taking the partial derivative of s d 2 with respect to z d at z d 1 then one can obtain a13 s d 2 r d z d p z d z d 1 x 1 2 ψ 2 2 0 s d 1 r d p where x 1 2 i p e a d j 0 2 i p e a d 2 a d y 0 2 i p e a d 2 a d where j 0 and y 0 are zero order bessel functions of the first and second kind respectively substituting the eq a13 into eq 6 the governing equation for the confined aquifer in the laplace domain can be rewritten as a14 2 s d 1 r d 2 1 r d s d 1 r d c d x 1 2 γ 2 1 p d d s d 1 0 where γ 2 1 y 1 2 i p a d j 1 2 i p a d det ψ 2 2 1 application of hankel transform with above eq a14 one can obtain the

corresponding author this manuscript was handled by andras bardossy editor in chief with the assistance of shailesh kumar singh associate editor multi hazard risk assessment may provide comprehensive analysis of the impact of multiple hazards but still needs to resolve major challenges in three aspects 1 proper consideration of hazard inter dependency 2 physically based modelling of hazard interactions and 3 fully quantitative risk assessment to show the probability of loss compound flooding is a typical multi hazard problem that involves the concurrence of multiple hazard drivers e g heavy rainfall extreme river flow and storm surge these hazard drivers may result from the same weather system and are thus statistically inter dependent physically overlayed and interacted in the same region this paper aims to address the mentioned challenges and develop an integrated assessment framework to quantify compound flood risk the framework is constructed based on the three typical components in disaster risk assessment i e hazard vulnerability and exposure analysis in hazard analysis joint probability and return period distributions of the three hazard drivers of compound flooding are estimated using copula functions with hazard dependency analysis which are then used to generate random multi hazard events to drive a 2d high performance hydrodynamic model to produce probabilistic inundation maps and frequency inundation curves vulnerability and exposure analysis provides damage functions of the elements at risk which are used to quantify multi hazard risk with the frequency inundation curves the framework is applied in the greater london and its downstream thames estuary to demonstrate its capability to analyse hazard interactions and inter dependencies to produce fully quantitative risk assessment results such as risk curves quantifying the probability of loss and risk maps illustrating the annual expected loss of residential buildings keywords multi hazard risk assessment compound flooding hydrodynamic model copula functions 1 introduction disasters triggered by different types of natural hazards such as storms floods droughts earthquakes and landslides threaten the safety and sustainable development of human societies el masri and tipple 2002 some disasters may be attributed to more than one triggering hazards for example the 1928 london flood was caused by the concurrence of extreme river flow from the upstream river thames and storm surge from the north sea carlsson hyslop 2010 the 2009 taiwan debris flows directly triggered by typhoon morakot were also considered as the aftermath of the 1999 chi chi earthquake hsu et al 2014 shieh et al 2009 in different regions across the world it is common that people and their properties are exposed to different hazards simultaneously or successively dilley et al 2005 multi hazards may potentially lead to more severe catastrophes than individual hazards and should be collectively considered in disaster risk assessment and management with the necessity of better understanding disasters induced by multiple drivers kappes et al 2012 the concept of multi hazards has been proposed and used since the 1990s together with other similar terminologies such as coinciding hazards european commission 2010 compound hazards vahedifard et al 2016 and compound events leonard et al 2014 according to the relationship between the hazard components multi hazards may be classified into 1 concurrent hazards the concurrence of two or more hazard events in time and or space chen et al 2012 2 successive hazards the recurrence of the same type of hazards in a short period of time so that they become interdependent shieh et al 2009 3 cascading hazards the primary hazard s trigger other secondary tertiary hazards or increase the probability of other hazards also known as hazard chains xu et al 2014 this work will focus on the concurrent hazards consistent with the broader concept of disaster risk defined as the potential consequence of a disaster and quantified by the probability of loss multi hazard risk considered herein involves three typical risk components i e multi hazard vulnerability and exposure crichton 1999 a number of attempts have been reported to broadly analyse and better understand multi hazard risk at national continental or global scales e g china shi 2011 the usa fema 2011 europe espon 2006 lung et al 2013 and the whole globe shi and kasperson 2015 these risk assessment studies usually consider different types of hazards in the selected case studies at a broad scale e g country state province etc in contrast fine scale assessment provides more elaborate risk analysis at higher spatial resolutions but usually only focuses on the most significant hazards to the local areas for example westen et al 2002 adopted gis based statistical approaches to assess multi hazard risk from flooding earthquake and landslide in a city of costa rica lozoya et al 2011 assessed the risk of multiple coastal hazards in a coastal area in spain bell and glade 2004 presented a grid based 20 m 20 m risk assessment framework for debris flow and rock fall in a settlement of iceland whilst there have been many attempts to assess multi hazard risk most of the existing approaches and practices have clear limitations which may be broadly categorised into the following three aspects firstly the statistical correlation between the contributing hazards is typically ignored assuming all hazards are independent to each other liu et al 2016 but the occurrence of hazards and their potential inter dependencies may actually affect the joint frequency of multi hazards and the probability of loss selva 2013 secondly the physical interaction between the contributing hazards i e the impact of one hazard on the other hazard s gill and malamud 2014 is either neglected or taken into account using over simplified approaches e g by spatially overlying hazard components without proper consideration of the underlying complex interacting processes kameshwar and padgett 2014 finally most of existing multi hazard risk analysis frameworks are based on either qualitative or semi quantitative methods kappes et al 2012 qualitative methods use pre defined ranks e g high medium low to classify each of the risk components and combine them in a matrix to derive integrated risk ranks schmidt thomé et al 2003 risk assessment results from such a classification process can only be used to roughly compare the level of risk between regions semi quantitative risk assessment is generally index based and adopts weighting methods to combine risk components to indicate the final multi hazard risk greiving et al 2006 whilst they are able to quantify and compare the risk levels in different regions risk ranks or indexes do not contain the probability of loss and therefore cannot completely represent the risk defined jointly by hazard vulnerability and exposure being able to provide probability loss curves or expected average loss and predict the potential damage or loss a fully quantitative assessment framework may produce more detailed information for decision makers and practioners to inform and implement disaster risk management grünthal et al 2006 ming et al 2015 xu et al 2019 considering compound flooding as a multi hazard problem zscheischler et al 2018 research effort has been reported to address the aforementioned limitations of the exiting multi hazard risk assessment frameworks comparing with hazard analysis vulnerability and exposure analyses may be undertaken in a relatively straightforward way as they usually only involve in one variable i e inundation depth which is the final consequence of the three driving hazards therefore the traditional approaches and datasets to quantify flood vulnerability and exposure dutta et al 2003 nadal et al 2010 nasiri et al 2016 may be applied directly in a multi hazard risk assessment framework however the multi hazard analysis is more challenging as the three drivers leading to compound flooding can be influenced by the same weather system such as a cyclone lewis et al 2013 svensson and jones 2002 and interact with each other to exaggerate the resulting impact in comparison with a single hazard flood event klerk et al 2015 to address the first limitation of multi hazard risk assessment as mentioned researchers have applied statistical methods e g bivariate joint probability analysis to quantify the dependencies between two compound flood drivers i e rainfall vs river flow rainfall vs storm surge and river flow vs storm surge horsburgh and wilson 2007 petroliagkis et al 2016 zheng et al 2014 a few studies have also attempted to evaluate the dependencies of all three hazard drivers that may potentially concur simultaneously in an estuary paprotny et al 2018 svensson and jones 2004 to address the second limitation physically based flood models are commonly used to predict compound flood scenarios to capture the physical interactions between hazard drivers for instance chen et al 2010 applied a simplified flood model to simulate and investigate the interactions between the flooding processes in rivers and floodplains lian et al 2013 used a 1d hydrodynamic model to simulate the flood dynamics caused by rainfall and tide in the river systems in the city of fuzhou china kumbier et al 2018 adopted a 2d hydrodynamic model to predict the interactive processes caused by river flow and storm surge in an australian estuary and demonstrated that neglecting their interactions may underestimate the compound flood risk preliminary attempts have also been made to consider both statistical dependencies and physical interactions between hazard components in developing quantitative multi hazard risk assessment frameworks to address the third limitation apel et al 2015 presented an assessment framework for fluvial and pluvial compound flooding in a city in the mekong delta using a 2d hydraulic model driven by stochastic rainfall and flow boundary conditions to generate inundation maps with estimated exceedance probabilities however the joint probability was calculated by assuming independent rainfall and river flow more recently zellou and rahali 2019 applied copula functions to consider the dependencies between rainfall and storm surge to create joint flood scenarios in the bouregreg river estuary in morocco which are then simulated using a 2d hydraulic model to produce inundation maps corresponding to the given occurrence probabilities of the inter dependent flood drivers however no attempt was made to consider vulnerability and exposure when estimating the probability of loss damage in multi hazard risk assessment this paper presents a new fully quantitative multi hazard risk assessment framework for compound flooding driven by interactive pluvial fluvial and coastal processes to address altogether the three limitations of the existing approaches the rest of the paper is organised as follows section 2 introduces the multi hazard risk assessment framework section 3 describes the case study area and data section 4 presents and discusses the results obtained at different steps of multi hazard risk assessment applied in the case study site and finally brief conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 risk assessment framework taking compound flooding induced by rainfall river flow and storm surge as an example this work develops a fully quantitative multi hazard risk assessment framework consisting of four components including hazard frequency analysis hydrodynamic flood simulation vulnerability analysis and multi hazard risk calculation fig 1 frequency analysis estimates the joint probability distributions of the three hazard components using dependence analysis and copula functions nelson 1999 to stochastically generate extreme multi hazard events for a given frequency of occurrence these extreme multi hazard flood events are then simulated using a high performance 2d hydrodynamic model liang 2010 xia et al 2019 xia et al 2017 to produce probabilistic inundation maps vulnerability analysis provides hazard damage functions and exposure information of properties supported by loss data from the multi coloured manual mcm penning rowsell et al 2013 and building data from the national property dataset npd and the digimap finally the risk calculation component combines the results of hazard and vulnerability analysis to quantify the potential loss and generate quantitative risk curves and maps of expected loss 2 1 frequency analysis joint probability distribution provides the quantitative information about statistical behaviour between multiple variables which is crucial for multi hazard frequency analysis letting x 1 x 2 x d be d continuous random variables having marginal distribution functions f 1 f 2 f d respectively the joint cumulative distribution function of multiple variables may be written as 1 h x 1 x 2 x d p x 1 x 1 x 2 x 2 x d x d if the random variables are fully independent from each other we have 2 h x 1 x 2 x d i 1 d f i x i when the variables are not independent the joint distribution from the marginal distributions cannot be simply expressed using eq 2 but may be constructed using a copula function nelson 1999 as follows 3 h x 1 x 2 x d c f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f d x d according to the sklar theorem sklar 1959 the copula function is uniquely determined when the joint and marginal distributions are given copula has become a widely used statistical tool for multi variable modelling in many fields for multi hazard analysis the key advantage of applying copula is that the univariate distribution of each variable is not necessarily from the same parametric family a well fitted copula function can be used to combine the marginal distributions of individual variables hazards to generate a joint distribution function for joint frequency analysis 2 1 1 joint probability distribution based on copulas the typical procedure to build the joint probability distribution of multiple variables using a copula function involves the following steps fit the marginal distribution of each variable test multivariate independency construct copulas perform goodness of fit tests for copulas select the best fit copula to generate the joint distribution function the first step is to find an appropriate univariate distribution function to fit the observations from each of the individual hazards the second step evaluates the necessity of applying non independent copula functions for the multiple variables using a multivariate mutual independency testing process introduced by genest and rémillard 2004 in which the testing statistics is defined as 4 i n 0 1 d n c n u i 1 d u i 2 d u where u u 1 u 2 u d is the vector of marginal distributions u i f i x i n is the number of observations for each of the variables d is the dimension of the variables in this context and c n is the empirical copula the null hypothesis for testing independency is that all of the components in the vector of random variables x 1 x 2 x d are mutually independent which means that the copula function of these variables is c u u i based on eq 2 if the null hypothesis is rejected it is necessary to find a suitable copula with a certain degree of dependency to fit the joint probability distribution otherwise eq 2 can be applied directly with the marginals to generate the joint distribution function a copula function has at least one or more parameters depending on the ranks of observations several different non parametric approaches are available to estimate the parameters of copulas including the inversion kendall s tau estimator the inversion spearman s rho estimator and the maximum pseudo likelihood estimator due to its high computational efficiency the maximum pseudo likelihood estimator has been widely used in parameter estimation for multidimensional copulas genest and favre 2007 if a one parameter copula c θ with density function c θ is selected in joint probability analysis for trivariate random variables x y z with a sample of n observations x i y i z i of ranks r i s i t i the likelihood function l is defined as 5 l θ i 1 n l n c θ r i n 1 s i n 1 t i n 1 many different families of copulas are available such as gaussian copulas placket copulas student s t copulas and archimedean copulas the one parameter archimedean copulas are most widely used in joint probability analysis as they are easy to construct and several software packages are available to support their parameter estimation the expressions of the four types of archimedean copulas are given in table 1 together with the respective bivariate and trivariate cumulative distribution functions cdfs it is necessary to perform a goodness of fit test to confirm the selected copulas are sufficiently fitted to a given significance level the test is based on a null hypothesis that the selected copula is valid for the observations and several approaches genest et al 2009 are available to serve the purpose the approach based on multiplier central limit theorems introduced by kojadinovic and yan 2011 has been shown to have the best efficiency a copula r package has been developed for modelling multivariate distributions with functions including the test of multivariate independence estimation of parameters goodness of fit test and random number generation kojadinovic and yan 2010 yan 2007 however it is still possible that more than one type of copulas can pass the goodness of fit test a more straightforward way for copula selection is to compare the average euclidean square distance between the empirical copula and the fitted copula to select the best fit copula with the minimum error distance zhang et al 2006 2 1 2 joint return period and hazard scenarios return period sometimes also referred as recurrence interval is often used to quantify the probability of recurrence of a hazard event exceeding a specific magnitude for a single hazard with its intensity indicated by a random variable x the return period t x is the expected recurrence time of the event such that x is larger than x defined as 6 t x m t p x x m t 1 f x x where m t is the average reoccurrence time typically given in years that equals the time span divided by the number of the events in univariate analysis a hazard scenario is typically the upper set of a random variable describing the phenomenon of interest in multivariate analysis the upper set is multi dimensional and therefore a multi hazard scenario can be defined in several different ways zheng et al 2014 as an example there may be four trivariate hazard scenarios fig 2 as defined by salvadori et al 2016 a the and scenario where each variable is larger than an extreme threshold b the or scenario with one of the variables is larger than the threshold c the kendall scenario where the sample points located in the upper set are defined by a kendall distribution function layer and d the survival kendall scenario that the sample points located in the lower set are defined by a survival kendall distribution function layer a narrow definition of multi hazard disaster is a joint consequence of all of the related hazards indicated by variables exceeding the extreme level but any individual hazards do not necessarily lead to a disaster which corresponds to the scenario a or d the critical surface in scenario d is a precise layer to distinguish the extreme events from the normal observations however to obtain this 3d layer requires numerous observations or simulations for multi hazard events which are not usually available or feasible in practice instead the critical layer in scenario a can be simply represented by the extreme thresholds of each of the hazards in the proposed multi hazard risk assessment framework we will focus on the concurrence of trivariate extremes as illustrated in fig 2 a for hazard scenario a let x y and x y z be the random variables representing the double and triple hazard combinations respectively an example function defining the bivariate joint return period is given as 7 t xy x y m t p x x y y m t 1 f x x f y y f x y x y m t 1 f x x f y y c f x x f y y where f x x and f y y are respectively the marginal distributions of x a n d y m t is the average recurrence interval of bivariate extreme events and c is the bivariate copula of f x x and f y y similarly the trivariate joint return period of x y z can be defined as 8 t xyz m t p x x y y z z m t 1 f xyz x y z where f xyz x y z f x x f y y f z z f xy x y f xz x z f yz y z f xyz x y z with f x x f y y and f z z being the univariate margins f xy x y f xz x z and f yz y z the bivariate margins and f xyz x y z the trivariate joint distribution both the bivariate margins and trivariate distributions can be obtained from their corresponding bivariate and trivariate copula functions and the univariate margins from eqs 6 8 multi hazard events can be randomly generated at a given return period which can then be used to create boundary conditions to drive the hydrodynamic model to predict compound floods 2 2 flood simulation the high performance integrated hydrodynamic modelling system hipims introduced in xia et al 2019 is adopted to predict the dynamic process of compound flooding and produce inundation and velocity maps to support multi hazard risk assessment hipims solves the full 2d shallow water equations swes using a shock capturing godunov type finite volume method and is able to provide accurate numerical solutions for different types of flood hydrodynamics including those highly transient and even discontinuous flows induced by dam breaks flash floods and storm surges liang 2010 driven by rainfall river flow and tidal boundary conditions hipims is able to predict the interactive flooding processes from multiple sources to substantially improve its computational efficiency to support large scale simulations at a high spatial resolution hipims is implemented on multiple graphics processing units gpus using the nvidia cuda platform to achieve high performance computing refer to xia et al 2019 for details hipims has been widely applied to simulate different types of flooding processes in cities and catchments e g xing et al 2019 xia et al 2019 and has been integrated with numerical weather predictions for real time forecasting of floods from intense rainfall across a large catchment ming et al 2020 as the current multi hazard risk assessment framework requires many simulations to provide high resolution results of flood depth and extent for evaluating compound flood risk hipims provides a useful modelling tool that meets these requirements 2 3 vulnerability analysis vulnerability analysis identifies those elements at risk namely exposure and also estimates the level of vulnerability e g through derivation of vulnerability curves of the at risk elements i e the elements exposed to flooding the current multi hazard risk assessment framework focuses only on evaluating lossess to properties buildings exposure analysis provides information about the types characters and values of the properties buildings that are under threats of flooding based on exposure data available from the national property database and digimap service the approaches to derive the vulnerability curves can be varied such as methods based on experimental measurements for wooden buildings yin and li 2011 methods based on past damage or loss survey data for infrastructure kelman 2002 and index based statistical methods for social vulnerability ge et al 2013 letting v d be a vulnerability function representing the damage ratio of properties against inundation depth d the disaster loss l can then be calculated based on vulnerability and exposure value as 9 l v d e where e is either the number or the value of exposed properties broadly vulnerability analysis can be performed on different at risk elements such as residents properties and infrastructure eq 9 gives a general example of how to calculate disaster loss using a vulnerability function and exposure data the form of a vulnerability function and the way of quantifying exposure and loss may differ based on the considered at risk elements and the nature of loss data the equation may be also stochastic if a stochastic vulnerability function can be derived from large amount of historical loss data 2 4 risk assessment risk analysis estimates the probability of potential loss of a specific object or a group of objects in a certain spatial domain risk estimation methods may be varied with different risk concepts and purposes qualitative or semi quantitative risk assessment may be simply done by calculating the sum or the product of risk components on the other hand fully quantitative risk assessment does not just return a fixed value to indicate risk level but rather a function or curve to depict the probability of loss which is in accordance with the mathematical definition of risk the risk curve can be also transferred to a single value e g annual expected loss for comparing and mapping fig 3 illustrates the procedure of deriving a risk curve in the current multi hazard risk assessment framework firstly the return periods of events are predefined and used to generate multi hazard compound flood scenarios driven by rainfall river flow and storm surge according to their joint probability distribution then hipims is used to simulate the compound flood scenarios and produce inundation maps this builds a relationship between the return period and the flood inundation namely a hazard return period inundation curve disaster loss against different inundation depths can be estimated using the vulnerability curves and exposure data the relationship between the return period and disaster loss is then built and a risk return period loss curve can be finally obtained to define the probability of multi hazard loss 3 case study and data the proposed multi hazard risk assessment framework is applied to a case study in the greater london and the downstream area the necessary details of the case study site and the relevant data are introduced in this section 3 1 greater london and the thames estuary as shown in fig 4 the case study covers the greater london and its downstream area in the thames estuary which is referred to as the greater london catchment hereafter instead of directly adopting the administrative boundary of london the study region covers the part of thames catchment from kingston to the coast with a total area of 2718 km2 although the study site normally has minor or mild precipitation throughout the entire year severe weather systems such as storms are not rare and have caused different types of flooding in history such as the 1928 thames flood the 1947 upper lee flood and the 1953 east coast flood environment agency 2012 moreover the number of severe storms over the southern uk has experienced significant increase in the past few decades alexander 2005 and the frequency of extreme floods may further increase in the future due to climate change and sea level rise ipcc 2014 tidal surges high river flow and intense rainfall are the three main drivers of flooding in different parts of london greater london authority 2014 substantial research and practical effort has been made to assess the risk of different types of flooding in london but no attempt has yet been reported to adopt a multi hazard framework to systematically consider the risk of compound flooding and analyse the interactions and inter dependencies of different flood drivers greater london authority 2009 jenkins et al 2018 as a highly developed metropolitan region with a big population dense properties and prosperous economic activities london may suffer from unprecedented socio economic loss if it were hit by a compound flood which may lead to exaggerated impact compared with single hazard floods multi hazard risk assessment will provide essential information for policy makers to better plan the development in the area under climate change 3 2 data to support the multi hazard risk analysis daily rainfall records from 348 stations across the study site were obtained from the centre for environmental data analysis http www ceda ac uk after checking the length of records and the locations of the gauge stations cross ness is selected as the representative rain gauge because it provides the longest records over 110 years and its daily observations are close to the daily median values of all other stations with over 40 years of rainfall records the daily average flow discharge measured in the kingston river gauge see fig 4 is used to support the analysis of fluvial flooding hazard the river gauge provides daily flow observations that can be dated back to 1880s and available from the uk national river flow archive https nrfa ceh ac uk the sheerness tidal station located at the south bank of the thames estuary provides 1 hour or 15 min tidal and surge records for about 67 years from 1953 which can be obtained from the british oceanographic data centre https www bodc ac uk data the daily maximum surge is used to represent the coastal driver for compound flooding a summary of the hazard data is given in table 2 the locations of the selected rainfall river flow and tidal gauges see fig 4 are also spatially distributed to provide the required boundary conditions to drive the flood model to predict the compound flood scenarios additionally water level records from eight river gauges along the thames are also used to calibrate and validate hipims hipims also requires landcover maps and terrain data including land surface digital elevation model dem and bathymetric data to support flood simulations landcover 2017 version may be downloaded from the u k environment agency ea website https environment data gov uk dem 2017 version and the marine themes dem surveyed in september 2016 at a resolution of approx 30 m provides bathymetric data in the case study region and is available for download from digimap with license https digimap edina ac uk the uk flood defence dataset is further used to consider the impact of flood defence facilities on flood simulations and may be acquired from the ea https data gov uk dataset cc76738e fc17 49f9 a216 977c61858dda aims spatial flood defences inc standardised attributes 4 results this section presents and discusses the results obtained in different steps of multi hazard risk assessment in the case study 4 1 joint probability analysis for multiple hazards relevant to the current multi hazard risk analysis we consider the inter dependencies between the extreme events as observed for the three hazard variables i e daily rainfall daily average flow discharge and daily maximum surge the 90th percentile pot90 of each of these variables is selected to generate a joint peak over threshold pot series as the samples of extreme events to evaluate their inter dependencies and joint probability distribution this threshold is chosen based on two considerations 1 high enough to be treated as extreme and 2 low enough to retain a reasonable sample size the selected extremes may have short range temporal dependence in practice as they may last over a few days therefore the sample extreme observations of each of the hazards are filtered by removing the repeated events within a four day time interval a total of 143 trivariate observed extremes are obtained and shown in fig 5 together with the rank based correlation measures spearman s ρ and kendall s τ the inter dependency between rainfall and river flow is found to be the strongest while that of rainfall and surge is the weakest the multivariate mutual independency test based on eq 4 shows strong inter dependencies between the three hazard variables therefore the inter dependencies between individual hazards cannot be neglected and copula functions will be used to estimate the joint multi hazard distribution to estimate the joint probability distribution as introduced in section 2 1 1 the univariate distribution functions are firstly fitted for each of the hazard variables the gev distribution is the best fitted margin for each of the hazards and their parameters are given in table 3 the parameters of the 3d gumbel clayton and frank copula functions listed in table 1 can be estimated using the maximum pseudo likelihood method which has been implemented in the copula r package as previously mentioned following the goodness of fit tests for these 3d copulas performed against the joint extreme observations the clayton trivariate copula with α 0 13 returns the best fit and is used for further analysis with the selected univariate margins and clayton trivariate copula function a 3d joint return period function can be derived from eq 8 the joint return periods can then be obtained for any given values of rainfall river flow and storm surge within the function domain a 2d distribution function of return period can also be generated when one of variables is fixed fig 6 presents the trivariate hazard surfaces for the joint return periods of 50 100 200 and 500 years within a hazard surface a monte carlo approach can be applied to create stochastic trivariate events of the same frequency of occurrence using random sampling 4 2 hydrodynamic modelling results for compound flooding as a fully hydrodynamic model hipims only involves two types of parameters including friction and infiltration for a simulation the friction is related to the manning coefficient to account for bed roughness the manning coefficient is usually estimated based on land use and other characteristics of land surface and can adopt values as suggested in a hydraulics text book e g chow 1959 infiltration is related to soil properties and conditions and may be neglected for extreme events xia et al 2019 herein before being applied to support multi hazard flood risk analysis hipims is first validated by reproducing three historical flood events inside or close to the greater london catchment to ensure its capability in representing multi source flooding processes in this area 4 2 1 model calibration and validation most of the river gauges inside the case study site are influenced by the tidal cycles and the flow stage records may not entirely reflect the flood peaks from the upstream catchment therefore the performance of hipims in reproducing rainfall runoff and flooding processes is evaluated in the upper lee catchment located outside of but close to the study site fig 7 a the river gauge at feildes weir records the outlet discharge from the catchment and is free from tidal influence the met office nimrod radar rainfall records available from the ceda archive http badc nerc ac uk are used to drive hipims and reproduce a flood event caused by heavy rainfall on 5th 8th february 2014 hipims is run on a uniform grid of 20 m resolution across the entire catchment with the manning coefficient for river channels and other rural catchment areas respectively set to 0 020 and 0 035 according to chow 1959 fig 7 b compares the simulated and observed flow hydrographs at the feildes weir gauge satisfactory agreement is achieved demonstrating that hipims can reliably predict the rainfall induced flooding process in this region to confirm its performance in predicting the flow flooding process influenced by both river flow and tide and or surge the observed sub daily river flow at kingston and the tidal level at sheerness from 31st march to 2nd april 2014 are used as boundary conditions to drive hipims to simulate the subsequent response the predicted time series of water level are compared with the observations at the eight gauges distributed along the considered reach of the river thames as shown in fig 8 the erith gauge recorded some suspicious values that are inconsistent with the trend of the periodic waves and thus removed by visual inspection after excluding the suspicious values it is evident that hipims captures reasonably well both the peak and the shape of the stage hydrographs at all eight gauges with the pearson s correlation coefficient all calculated to be greater than 0 93 therefore we may conclude that hipims can simulate the river flow processes influenced by ocean tides to further confirm hipims s capability in simulating coastal flooding induced by storm surge the 1953 north sea flood occured in the thames estuary is further considered which is one of the most devastating floods striking the east coast of london in history the event was described by steers 1953 who also provided the necessary tidal and surge data to support hydrodynamic flood modelling as the areas has experienced substantial development including construction of a series of flood defences including walls dikes and barriers after the event the present dem is not expected to well represent the terrain features in 1953 to better reproduce the flood event the current dem is corrected by removing the flood defence facilities according to their location height and construction time as specified in the uk flood defence dataset however uncertainties may still exist as we cannot sufficiently take into account the changes of landcover bathymetry and surface topography due to natural evolution and other engineering developments hipims is run for three days two days before the peak surge level and one day after to reproduce this historical flood event the simulated maximum flood extent is illustrated in fig 9 compared with the surveyed extent indicated by the red lines it should be noted that those areas that are not covered by the surveyed extent should not be interpreted as never been flooded during the event because the post event survey data strongly relies on subjective information provided by residents and the surveyors might miss out some less accessible areas in general most of flooded areas are successfully reproduced by hipims confirming its capability to support coastal flood modelling in the thames estuary 4 2 2 results of sample compound flood scenarios to simulate the compound flood scenarios to support the following multi hazard risk assessment hipims is set up for the whole greater london catchment at a uniform grid of 20 m spatial resolution the manning coefficient is set to 0 020 for river channels and 0 035 for the rest of the domain synthetic compound flood events are sampled from the 3d probability space through changing the three hazard variables three values are selected for each of the hazard variables evenly across the ranges of hazard observations and combined to construct a set of multi hazard samples i e 3 3 3 27 compound flood events to drive the hydrodynamic flood simulations to estimate the flood extent we define a grid cell as being flooded when its maximum water depth is larger than 0 3 m all of the 27 simulations last for 24 h and the results are shown in fig 10 as a 3d scatter plot to indicate the total flooded areas across the whole case study site the total inundated area is observed to increase as the hazard intensity i e the value of each of the three hazard variables increases which is as expected but the increasing rate is relatively small for river flow compared with the other two hazard variables indicating that the river flow i e fluvial flooding has the lowest impact on the overall inundation in this case study fig 11 shows two out of the 27 multi hazard inundation maps from the simulations as examples fig 11 a is the result of a 1 in 300 year event where the flooded area is mostly distributed along the river thames and the east coast with only a few discrete flooded spots of inundation away from the riverside caused by rainfall fig 11 b shows the result of the most extreme event as considered in all of the simulations in which the floodplains along the river thames have been mostly flooded and severe pluvial flooding can be also observed in many places across the domain but these individual inundation maps do not provide probability based information to show which areas are more likely to be flooded than the other this is because flood inundation of the same return period in different regions may be attributed to different hazard combinations and therefore the flooding may not be necessarily caused by the same drivers to quantify multi flood hazards locally it is necessary to separately analyse the flood simulation results in each of the grid cells to produce local hazard curves 4 2 3 inundation probability curves since the data and model parameters used to set up hipims remain unchanged across all of the simulations the model outputs e g the maximum inundation depth in each of the grid cells are a trivariate function of the three hazard variables that specify the rainfall river flow and tidal surge boundary conditions to drive the simulations the trivariate function is monotonically increasing in respect of each of the three hazard variables this means that it is reasonable to estimate the cell based maximum flood depth through interpolation of the results from a few typical simulations evenly and discretely distributed in the 3d space of the function domain based on this the cell based hazard curves can be produced through the following steps 1 specify a series of return periods e g ranging from 10 to 2000 years at a 10 year interval as considered in this work 2 for each of the return periods generate 1000 synthetic compound flood events using monte carlo simulation in the trivariate return period distribution space 3 calculate inundation results i e maximum inundation depths herein of these randomly generated events to avoid numerous expensive hydrodynamic model runs the maximum inundation depths are interpolated from the outputs of the 27 sample scenarios simulated by hipims as introduced in the previous section the interpolation of maximum depth is carried out in each of the computational cells inside the domain 4 extract the maximum value from these interpolated 1000 maximum inundation depths in each cell which defines the non exceeding inundation depth corresponding to the specific return period 5 repeat steps 2 4 for all of the return periods selected in step 1 to produce a series of maximum depth values corresponding to the specific return periods in each of the computational cells this effectively creates an inundation depth return period curve which is the cell based hazard curve defining the relationship between the inundation depth i e hazard and return period i e frequency of occurrence these cell based hazard curves may be further used to generate other types of hazard curves in any specific region covered by a certain number of computational cells for example we can produce a hazard curve to indicate the probability of inundated area in a specific region by counting the flooded cells fig 12 illustrates the hazard curves constructed for total inundated area due to compound flooding in the entire greater london catchment and similar curves can be generated for any regions 4 3 results of vulnerability and risk analysis 4 3 1 exposure and vulnerability curves in this work residential buildings are chosen as an example to demonstrate the adopted approaches in exposure and vulnerability analysis and the following multi hazard risk assessment for residential buildings the national property dataset npd provides geographical locations of properties but not the detail information related to property classification and valuation accordingly the exposure analysis adopted herein is focused on quantifying the number of residential buildings in each of the grid cells the result is illustrated in fig 13 a showing that the residential buildings are mostly distributed in the middle and western regions of the greater london catchment apart from the city centre where properties are densely distributed residential buildings along the downstream thames riversides and the coast e g gravesend the canvey island and southend are particularly vulnerable to extreme floods from multiple sources as revealed in the hazard map in fig 11 vulnerability analysis involves investigating the internal attributes and external environmental factors that may cause damage to the at risk elements to produce vulnerability curves or functions to show the relationship between the hazard inundation depth and or flow velocity and loss this work adopts the existing vulnerability analysis outcomes from mcm in the study area to test the proposed multi hazard risk assessment framework mcm provides vulnerability data for five types of residential buildings in the format of direct loss functions against inundation depth these vulnerability functions are linked to several scenarios according to flood warning levels including no warning 8 hour warning and 8 hour warning as the flood forecasting system is well established and continues to operate in the uk ballard et al 2016 it is assumed that the greater london catchment can receive the flood warning more than 8 h in advance the adopted flood depth damage curves for residential buildings are illustrated in fig 13 b the direct damage value of buildings is based on the 2017 price with previous data adjusted to account for inflation as the exposure data does not specify the detailed categories of the residential buildings in the research area we use the residential sector average curve to represent the vulnerability of all residential houses in each of the appraising cells 4 3 2 risk curves following the previous hazard vulnerability and exposure analyses multi hazard risk curves are established to quantify the probability of residential building loss in each of the computational cells eight of these risk curves are produced for different administrative districts in the great london catchment as illustrated in fig 14 the curves show that turrock and tower are subject to the highest level of compound flood risk in contrast the probability of residential building loss at southend on sea is the lowest and stays in zero loss for any potential events lower than 200 year return period this may be because this area is protected by well established flood defence systems for up to 200 year floods but is still at high risk of more extreme events driven by surges overtopping the sea walls 4 3 3 risk maps of average annual loss to better visualise the compound flood risk across the study domain a risk map is produced to visualize the annual average loss aal calculated from the risk curves at each of the cells to indicate the annual non exceedance probability of loss it should be noted that the aal is the mathematical expectation of the risk function and is a long period expectation meaning that such a loss is not expected to occur every year in this case the period refers to as the length of hazard records 67 years fig 15 presents the risk map obtained by plotting the non zero aal values at each of the grid cells over the whole domain it shows that the city centre area in the south bank of thames outstands by high aal values indicating that the residential buildings in this area are subject to high risk of loss from compound flooding however whilst the inundation map as shown in fig 11 indicates that the south bank of the thame estuary is easy to be flooded the aal in this area is almost zero because of very few buildings are located here clearly the risk map provides an effective means to spatially visualise and compare loss prediction across the domain 5 discussion and conclusions this work presents a multi hazard risk assessment framework to consider the inter dependencies and interactions between multiple hazard drivers and produce fully quantitative results of the compound flood risk driven by high river flow heavy rainfall and extreme surge the risk outputs are presented as risk curves of loss frequency function and risk maps of expected average annual loss the risk curves give a probabilistic estimation of loss induced by compound flooding in each of the computational cells the risk map illustrates the overall pattern of the risk level in the whole case study area compared with some of the existing multi hazard risk assessment approaches the proposed framework allows fully quantitative estimation of multi hazard risk from compound flooding and is therefore able to provide more information to support regional planning and flood risk management a few assumptions and simplifications have been made to reduce the complexity of the proposed framework and make large scale hydrodynamic simulations computationally feasible to support the fully quantitative multi hazard risk assessment the sub daily variation of all of the three hazard variables and the spatial variation of rainfall over the greater london catchment are neglected to reduce the dimensions in joint probability analysis and avoid the exponential increase of the number of multi hazard flood simulations as required this contributes to a main source of uncertainties in the hydrodynamic modelling and risk assessment process in this work other potential uncertainties worth mentioning include due to the limited sample size of the measured hazard data uncertainties may exist in the fitted joint probability and return period distributions these uncertainties are measurable according to the number of extreme events in the case study site and can be reduced if a longer series of hazard records are available for medium return periods however even hazard records may span over a century flood frequency analysis for longer return periods over 100 year may still be subject to high uncertainties these uncertainties may be controlled by incorporating data from instrumental observations non expert documentations or natural records of historical floods as interpreted by paleohydrologists st george and mudelsee 2019 a hydrodynamic model requires much fewer parameters than a hydrological model in flood modelling which effectively reduces the uncertainties related to model parameters and calibration however due to the limited availability of observed data for calibrating hipims for compound flood modelling uncertainties still inevitably exist in the simulation results only 27 compound flood scenarios have been simulated in the case study such a small sample group will bring great uncertainties to the risk assessment results to well represent the 3d space of multi hazard millions of joint events or even more may need to be simulated which is unrealistic for hydrodynamic modelling for such a high resolution and large scale case study this challenging issue may be addressed by developing effective machine learning techniques to predict flood inundation kabir et al 2020 to substantially reduce computational cost in the future the uncertainty in the vulnerability curves is a typical contributor to the final uncertainties in the risk curves a more comprehensive data collection and analysis process can help refine the probability damage functions curves and reduce the related uncertainties multi hazard risk assessment is especially valuable to the regions affected by inter dependent multiple water related hazards for example tropical cyclones can directly lead to storm surge in coastal areas and meanwhile bring heavy rainfall that may simultaneous cause pluvial and fluvial flooding the risk assessment framework can be applied in these regions to better understand and quantify compound flood risk to inform regional planning and the

corresponding author this manuscript was handled by andras bardossy editor in chief with the assistance of shailesh kumar singh associate editor multi hazard risk assessment may provide comprehensive analysis of the impact of multiple hazards but still needs to resolve major challenges in three aspects 1 proper consideration of hazard inter dependency 2 physically based modelling of hazard interactions and 3 fully quantitative risk assessment to show the probability of loss compound flooding is a typical multi hazard problem that involves the concurrence of multiple hazard drivers e g heavy rainfall extreme river flow and storm surge these hazard drivers may result from the same weather system and are thus statistically inter dependent physically overlayed and interacted in the same region this paper aims to address the mentioned challenges and develop an integrated assessment framework to quantify compound flood risk the framework is constructed based on the three typical components in disaster risk assessment i e hazard vulnerability and exposure analysis in hazard analysis joint probability and return period distributions of the three hazard drivers of compound flooding are estimated using copula functions with hazard dependency analysis which are then used to generate random multi hazard events to drive a 2d high performance hydrodynamic model to produce probabilistic inundation maps and frequency inundation curves vulnerability and exposure analysis provides damage functions of the elements at risk which are used to quantify multi hazard risk with the frequency inundation curves the framework is applied in the greater london and its downstream thames estuary to demonstrate its capability to analyse hazard interactions and inter dependencies to produce fully quantitative risk assessment results such as risk curves quantifying the probability of loss and risk maps illustrating the annual expected loss of residential buildings keywords multi

landslides threaten the safety and sustainable development of human societies el masri and tipple 2002 some disasters may be attributed to more than one triggering hazards for example the 1928 london flood was caused by the concurrence of extreme river flow from the upstream river thames and storm surge from the north sea carlsson hyslop 2010 the 2009 taiwan debris flows directly triggered by typhoon morakot were also considered as the aftermath of the 1999 chi chi earthquake hsu et al 2014 shieh et al 2009 in different regions across the world it is common that people and their properties are exposed to different hazards simultaneously or successively dilley et al 2005 multi hazards may potentially lead to more severe catastrophes than individual hazards and should be collectively considered in disaster risk assessment and management with the necessity of better understanding disasters induced by multiple drivers kappes et al 2012 the concept of multi hazards has been proposed and used since the 1990s together with other similar terminologies such as coinciding hazards european commission 2010 compound hazards vahedifard et al 2016 and compound events leonard et al 2014 according to the relationship between the hazard components multi hazards may be classified into 1 concurrent hazards the concurrence of two or more hazard events in time and or space chen et al 2012 2 successive hazards the recurrence of the same type of hazards in a short period of time so that they become interdependent shieh et al 2009 3 cascading hazards the primary hazard s trigger other secondary tertiary hazards or increase the probability of other hazards also known as hazard chains xu et al 2014 this work will focus on the concurrent hazards consistent with the broader concept of disaster risk defined as the potential consequence of a disaster and quantified by the probability of loss multi hazard risk considered herein involves three typical risk components i e multi hazard vulnerability and exposure crichton 1999 a number of attempts have been reported to broadly analyse and better understand multi hazard risk at national continental or global scales e g china shi 2011 the usa fema 2011 europe espon 2006 lung et al 2013 and the whole globe shi and kasperson 2015 these risk assessment studies usually consider different types of hazards in the selected case studies at a broad scale e g country state province etc in contrast fine scale assessment provides more elaborate risk analysis at higher spatial resolutions but usually only focuses on the most significant hazards to the local areas for example westen et al 2002 adopted gis based statistical approaches to assess multi hazard risk from flooding earthquake and landslide in a city of costa rica lozoya et al 2011 assessed the risk of multiple coastal hazards in a coastal area in spain bell and glade 2004 presented a grid based 20 m 20 m risk assessment framework for debris flow and rock fall in a settlement of iceland whilst there have been many attempts to assess multi hazard risk most of the existing approaches and practices have clear limitations which may be broadly categorised into the following three aspects firstly the statistical correlation between the contributing hazards is typically ignored assuming all hazards are independent to each other liu et al 2016 but the occurrence of hazards and their potential inter dependencies may actually affect the joint frequency of multi hazards and the probability of loss selva 2013 secondly the physical interaction between the contributing hazards i e the impact of one hazard on the other hazard s gill and malamud 2014 is either neglected or taken into account using over simplified approaches e g by spatially overlying hazard components without proper consideration of the underlying complex interacting processes kameshwar and padgett 2014 finally most of existing multi hazard risk analysis frameworks are based on either qualitative or semi quantitative methods kappes et al 2012 qualitative methods use pre defined ranks e g high medium low to classify each of the risk components and combine them in a matrix to derive integrated risk ranks schmidt thomé et al 2003 risk assessment results from such a classification process can only be used to roughly compare the level of risk between regions semi quantitative risk assessment is generally index based and adopts weighting methods to combine risk components to indicate the final multi hazard risk greiving et al 2006 whilst they are able to quantify and compare the risk levels in different regions risk ranks or indexes do not contain the probability of loss and therefore cannot completely represent the risk defined jointly by hazard vulnerability and exposure being able to provide probability loss curves or expected average loss and predict the potential damage or loss a fully quantitative assessment framework may produce more detailed information for decision makers and practioners to inform and implement disaster risk management grünthal et al 2006 ming et al 2015 xu et al 2019 considering compound flooding as a multi hazard problem zscheischler et al 2018 research effort has been reported to address the aforementioned limitations of the exiting multi hazard risk assessment frameworks comparing with hazard analysis vulnerability and exposure analyses may be undertaken in a relatively straightforward way as they usually only involve in one variable i e inundation depth which is the final consequence of the three driving hazards therefore the traditional approaches and datasets to quantify flood vulnerability and exposure dutta et al 2003 nadal et al 2010 nasiri et al 2016 may be applied directly in a multi hazard risk assessment framework however the multi hazard analysis is more challenging as the three drivers leading to compound flooding can be influenced by the same weather system such as a cyclone lewis et al 2013 svensson and jones 2002 and interact with each other to exaggerate the resulting impact in comparison with a single hazard flood event klerk et al 2015 to address the first limitation of multi hazard risk assessment as mentioned researchers have applied statistical methods e g bivariate joint probability analysis to quantify the dependencies between two compound flood drivers i e rainfall vs river flow rainfall vs storm surge and river flow vs storm surge horsburgh and wilson 2007 petroliagkis et al 2016 zheng et al 2014 a few studies have also attempted to evaluate the dependencies of all three hazard drivers that may potentially concur simultaneously in an estuary paprotny et al 2018 svensson and jones 2004 to address the second limitation physically based flood models are commonly used to predict compound flood scenarios to capture the physical interactions between hazard drivers for instance chen et al 2010 applied a simplified flood model to simulate and investigate the interactions between the flooding processes in rivers and floodplains lian et al 2013 used a 1d hydrodynamic model to simulate the flood dynamics caused by rainfall and tide in the river systems in the city of fuzhou china kumbier et al 2018 adopted a 2d hydrodynamic model to predict the interactive processes caused by river flow and storm surge in an australian estuary and demonstrated that neglecting their interactions may underestimate the compound flood risk preliminary attempts have also been made to consider both statistical dependencies and physical interactions between hazard components in developing quantitative multi hazard risk assessment frameworks to address the third limitation apel et al 2015 presented an assessment framework for fluvial and pluvial compound flooding in a city in the mekong delta using a 2d hydraulic model driven by stochastic rainfall and flow boundary conditions to generate inundation maps with estimated exceedance probabilities however the joint probability was calculated by assuming independent rainfall and river flow more recently zellou and rahali 2019 applied copula functions to consider the dependencies between rainfall and storm surge to create joint flood scenarios in the bouregreg river estuary in morocco which are then simulated using a 2d hydraulic model to produce inundation maps corresponding to the given occurrence probabilities of the inter dependent flood drivers however no attempt was made to consider vulnerability and exposure when estimating the probability of loss damage in multi hazard risk assessment this paper presents a new fully quantitative multi hazard risk assessment framework for compound flooding driven by interactive pluvial fluvial and coastal processes to address altogether the three limitations of the existing approaches the rest of the paper is organised as follows section 2 introduces the multi hazard risk assessment framework section 3 describes the case study area and data section 4 presents and discusses the results obtained at different steps of multi hazard risk assessment applied in the case study site and finally brief conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 risk assessment framework taking compound flooding induced by rainfall river flow and storm surge as an example this work develops a fully quantitative multi hazard risk assessment framework consisting of four components including hazard frequency analysis hydrodynamic flood simulation vulnerability analysis and multi hazard risk calculation fig 1 frequency analysis estimates the joint probability distributions of the three hazard components using dependence analysis and copula functions nelson 1999 to stochastically generate extreme multi hazard events for a given frequency of occurrence these extreme multi hazard flood events are then simulated using a high performance 2d hydrodynamic model liang 2010 xia et al 2019 xia et al 2017 to produce probabilistic inundation maps vulnerability analysis provides hazard damage functions and exposure information of properties supported by loss data from the multi coloured manual mcm penning rowsell et al 2013 and building data from the national property dataset npd and the digimap finally the risk calculation component combines the results of hazard and vulnerability analysis to quantify the potential loss and generate quantitative risk curves and maps of expected loss 2 1 frequency analysis joint probability distribution provides the quantitative information about statistical behaviour between multiple variables which is crucial for multi hazard frequency analysis letting x 1 x 2 x d be d continuous random variables having marginal distribution functions f 1 f 2 f d respectively the joint cumulative distribution function of multiple variables may be written as 1 h x 1 x 2 x d p x 1 x 1 x 2 x 2 x d x d if the random variables are fully independent from each other we have 2 h x 1 x 2 x d i 1 d f i x i when the variables are not independent the joint distribution from the marginal distributions cannot be simply expressed using eq 2 but may be constructed using a copula function nelson 1999 as follows 3 h x 1 x 2 x d c f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f d x d according to the sklar theorem sklar 1959 the copula function is uniquely determined when the joint and marginal distributions are given copula has become a widely used statistical tool for multi variable modelling in many fields for multi hazard analysis the key advantage of applying copula is that the univariate distribution of each variable is not necessarily from the same parametric family a well fitted copula function can be used to combine the marginal distributions of individual variables hazards to generate a joint distribution function for joint frequency analysis 2 1 1 joint probability distribution based on copulas the typical procedure to build the joint probability distribution of multiple variables using a copula function involves the following steps fit the marginal distribution of each variable test multivariate independency construct copulas perform goodness of fit tests for copulas select the best fit copula to generate the joint distribution function the first step is to find an appropriate univariate distribution function to fit the observations from each of the individual hazards the second step evaluates the necessity of applying non independent copula functions for the multiple variables using a multivariate mutual independency testing process introduced by genest and rémillard 2004 in which the testing statistics is defined as 4 i n 0 1 d n c n u i 1 d u i 2 d u where u u 1 u 2 u d is the vector of marginal distributions u i f i x i n is the number of observations for each of the variables d is the dimension of the variables in this context and c n is the empirical copula the null hypothesis for testing independency is that all of the components in the vector of random variables x 1 x 2 x d are mutually independent which means that the copula function of these variables is c u u i based on eq 2 if the null hypothesis is rejected it is necessary to find a suitable copula with a certain degree of dependency to fit the joint probability distribution otherwise eq 2 can be applied directly with the marginals to generate the joint distribution function a copula function has at least one or more parameters depending on the ranks of observations several different non parametric approaches are available to estimate the parameters of copulas including the inversion kendall s tau estimator the inversion spearman s rho estimator and the maximum pseudo likelihood estimator due to its high computational efficiency the maximum pseudo likelihood estimator has been widely used in parameter estimation for multidimensional copulas genest and favre 2007 if a one parameter copula c θ with density function c θ is selected in joint probability analysis for trivariate random variables x y z with a sample of n observations x i y i z i of ranks r i s i t i the likelihood function l is defined as 5 l θ i 1 n l n c θ r i n 1 s i n 1 t i n 1 many different families of copulas are available such as gaussian copulas placket copulas student s t copulas and archimedean copulas the one parameter archimedean copulas are most widely used in joint probability analysis as they are easy to construct and several software packages are available to support their parameter estimation the expressions of the four types of archimedean copulas are given in table 1 together with the respective bivariate and trivariate cumulative distribution functions cdfs it is necessary to perform a goodness of fit test to confirm the selected copulas are sufficiently fitted to a given significance level the test is based on a null hypothesis that the selected copula is valid for the observations and several approaches genest et al 2009 are available to serve the purpose the approach based on multiplier central limit theorems introduced by kojadinovic and yan 2011 has been shown to have the best efficiency a copula r package has been developed for modelling multivariate distributions with functions including the test of multivariate independence estimation of parameters goodness of fit test and random number generation kojadinovic and yan 2010 yan 2007 however it is still possible that more than one type of copulas can pass the goodness of fit test a more straightforward way for copula selection is to compare the average euclidean square distance between the empirical copula and the fitted copula to select the best fit copula with the minimum error distance zhang et al 2006 2 1 2 joint return period and hazard scenarios return period sometimes also referred as recurrence interval is often used to quantify the probability of recurrence of a hazard event exceeding a specific magnitude for a single hazard with its intensity indicated by a random variable x the return period t x is the expected recurrence time of the event such that x is larger than x defined as 6 t x m t p x x m t 1 f x x where m t is the average reoccurrence time typically given in years that equals the time span divided by the number of the events in univariate analysis a hazard scenario is typically the upper set of a random variable describing the phenomenon of interest in multivariate analysis the upper set is multi dimensional and therefore a multi hazard scenario can be defined in several different ways zheng et al 2014 as an example there may be four trivariate hazard scenarios fig 2 as defined by salvadori et al 2016 a the and scenario where each variable is larger than an extreme threshold b the or scenario with one of the variables is larger than the threshold c the kendall scenario where the sample points located in the upper set are defined by a kendall distribution function layer and d the survival kendall scenario that the sample points located in the lower set are defined by a survival kendall distribution function layer a narrow definition of multi hazard disaster is a joint consequence of all of the related hazards indicated by variables exceeding the extreme level but any individual hazards do not necessarily lead to a disaster which corresponds to the scenario a or d the critical surface in scenario d is a precise layer to distinguish the extreme events from the normal observations however to obtain this 3d layer requires numerous observations or simulations for multi hazard events which are not usually available or feasible in practice instead the critical layer in scenario a can be simply represented by the extreme thresholds of each of the hazards in the proposed multi hazard risk assessment framework we will focus on the concurrence of trivariate extremes as illustrated in fig 2 a for hazard scenario a let x y and x y z be the random variables representing the double and triple hazard combinations respectively an example function defining the bivariate joint return period is given as 7 t xy x y m t p x x y y m t 1 f x x f y y f x y x y m t 1 f x x f y y c f x x f y y where f x x and f y y are respectively the marginal distributions of x a n d y m t is the average recurrence interval of bivariate extreme events and c is the bivariate copula of f x x and f y y similarly the trivariate joint return period of x y z can be defined as 8 t xyz m t p x x y y z z m t 1 f xyz x y z where f xyz x y z f x x f y y f z z f xy x y f xz x z f yz y z f xyz x y z with f x x f y y and f z z being the univariate margins f xy x y f xz x z and f yz y z the bivariate margins and f xyz x y z the trivariate joint distribution both the bivariate margins and trivariate distributions can be obtained from their corresponding bivariate and trivariate copula functions and the univariate margins from eqs 6 8 multi hazard events can be randomly generated at a given return period which can then be used to create boundary conditions to drive the hydrodynamic model to predict compound floods 2 2 flood simulation the high performance integrated hydrodynamic modelling system hipims introduced in xia et al 2019 is adopted to predict the dynamic process of compound flooding and produce inundation and velocity maps to support multi hazard risk assessment hipims solves the full 2d shallow water equations swes using a shock capturing godunov type finite volume method and is able to provide accurate numerical solutions for different types of flood hydrodynamics including those highly transient and even discontinuous flows induced by dam breaks flash floods and storm surges liang 2010 driven by rainfall river flow and tidal boundary conditions hipims is able to predict the interactive flooding processes from multiple sources to substantially improve its computational efficiency to support large scale simulations at a high spatial resolution hipims is implemented on multiple graphics processing units gpus using the nvidia cuda platform to achieve high performance computing refer to xia et al 2019 for details hipims has been widely applied to simulate different types of flooding processes in cities and catchments e g xing et al 2019 xia et al 2019 and has been integrated with numerical weather predictions for real time forecasting of floods from intense rainfall across a large catchment ming et al 2020 as the current multi hazard risk assessment framework requires many simulations to provide high resolution results of flood depth and extent for evaluating compound flood risk hipims provides a useful modelling tool that meets these requirements 2 3 vulnerability analysis vulnerability analysis identifies those elements at risk namely exposure and also estimates the level of vulnerability e g through derivation of vulnerability curves of the at risk elements i e the elements exposed to flooding the current multi hazard risk assessment framework focuses only on evaluating lossess to properties buildings exposure analysis provides information about the types characters and values of the properties buildings that are under threats of flooding based on exposure data available from the national property database and digimap service the approaches to derive the vulnerability curves can be varied such as methods based on experimental measurements for wooden buildings yin and li 2011 methods based on past damage or loss survey data for infrastructure kelman 2002 and index based statistical methods for social vulnerability ge et al 2013 letting v d be a vulnerability function representing the damage ratio of properties against inundation depth d the disaster loss l can then be calculated based on vulnerability and exposure value as 9 l v d e where e is either the number or the value of exposed properties broadly vulnerability analysis can be performed on different at risk elements such as residents properties and infrastructure eq 9 gives a general example of how to calculate disaster loss using a vulnerability function and exposure data the form of a vulnerability function and the way of quantifying exposure and loss may differ based on the considered at risk elements and the nature of loss data the equation may be also stochastic if a stochastic vulnerability function can be derived from large amount of historical loss data 2 4 risk assessment risk analysis estimates the probability of potential loss of a specific object or a group of objects in a certain spatial domain risk estimation methods may be varied with different risk concepts and purposes qualitative or semi quantitative risk assessment may be simply done by calculating the sum or the product of risk components on the other hand fully quantitative risk assessment does not just return a fixed value to indicate risk level but rather a function or curve to depict the probability of loss which is in accordance with the mathematical definition of risk the risk curve can be also transferred to a single value e g annual expected loss for comparing and mapping fig 3 illustrates the procedure of deriving a risk curve in the current multi hazard risk assessment framework firstly the return periods of events are predefined and used to generate multi hazard compound flood scenarios driven by rainfall river flow and storm surge according to their joint probability distribution then hipims is used to simulate the compound flood scenarios and produce inundation maps this builds a relationship between the return period and the flood inundation namely a hazard return period inundation curve disaster loss against different inundation depths can be estimated using the vulnerability curves and exposure data the relationship between the return period and disaster loss is then built and a risk return period loss curve can be finally obtained to define the probability of multi hazard loss 3 case study and data the proposed multi hazard risk assessment framework is applied to a case study in the greater london and the downstream area the necessary details of the case study site and the relevant data are introduced in this section 3 1 greater london and the thames estuary as shown in fig 4 the case study covers the greater london and its downstream area in the thames estuary which is referred to as the greater london catchment hereafter instead of directly adopting the administrative boundary of london the study region covers the part of thames catchment from kingston to the coast with a total area of 2718 km2 although the study site normally has minor or mild precipitation throughout the entire year severe weather systems such as storms are not rare and have caused different types of flooding in history such as the 1928 thames flood the 1947 upper lee flood and the 1953 east coast flood environment agency 2012 moreover the number of severe storms over the southern uk has experienced significant increase in the past few decades alexander 2005 and the frequency of extreme floods may further increase in the future due to climate change and sea level rise ipcc 2014 tidal surges high river flow and intense rainfall are the three main drivers of flooding in different parts of london greater london authority 2014 substantial research and practical effort has been made to assess the risk of different types of flooding in london but no attempt has yet been reported to adopt a multi hazard framework to systematically consider the risk of compound flooding and analyse the interactions and inter dependencies of different flood drivers greater london authority 2009 jenkins et al 2018 as a highly developed metropolitan region with a big population dense properties and prosperous economic activities london may suffer from unprecedented socio economic loss if it were hit by a compound flood which may lead to exaggerated impact compared with single hazard floods multi hazard risk assessment will provide essential information for policy makers to better plan the development in the area under climate change 3 2 data to support the multi hazard risk analysis daily rainfall records from 348 stations across the study site were obtained from the centre for environmental data analysis http www ceda ac uk after checking the length of records and the locations of the gauge stations cross ness is selected as the representative rain gauge because it provides the longest records over 110 years and its daily observations are close to the daily median values of all other stations with over 40 years of rainfall records the daily average flow discharge measured in the kingston river gauge see fig 4 is used to support the analysis of fluvial flooding hazard the river gauge provides daily flow observations that can be dated back to 1880s and available from the uk national river flow archive https nrfa ceh ac uk the sheerness tidal station located at the south bank of the thames estuary provides 1 hour or 15 min tidal and surge records for about 67 years from 1953 which can be obtained from the british oceanographic data centre https www bodc ac uk data the daily maximum surge is used to represent the coastal driver for compound flooding a summary of the hazard data is given in table 2 the locations of the selected rainfall river flow and tidal gauges see fig 4 are also spatially distributed to provide the required boundary conditions to drive the flood model to predict the compound flood scenarios additionally water level records from eight river gauges along the thames are also used to calibrate and validate hipims hipims also requires landcover maps and terrain data including land surface digital elevation model dem and bathymetric data to support flood simulations landcover 2017 version may be downloaded from the u k environment agency ea website https environment data gov uk dem 2017 version and the marine themes dem surveyed in september 2016 at a resolution of approx 30 m provides bathymetric data in the case study region and is available for download from digimap with license https digimap edina ac uk the uk flood defence dataset is further used to consider the impact of flood defence facilities on flood simulations and may be acquired from the ea https data gov uk dataset cc76738e fc17 49f9 a216 977c61858dda aims spatial flood defences inc standardised attributes 4 results this section presents and discusses the results obtained in different steps of multi hazard risk assessment in the case study 4 1 joint probability analysis for multiple hazards relevant to the current multi hazard risk analysis we consider the inter dependencies between the extreme events as observed for the three hazard variables i e daily rainfall daily average flow discharge and daily maximum surge the 90th percentile pot90 of each of these variables is selected to generate a joint peak over threshold pot series as the samples of extreme events to evaluate their inter dependencies and joint probability distribution this threshold is chosen based on two considerations 1 high enough to be treated as extreme and 2 low enough to retain a reasonable sample size the selected extremes may have short range temporal dependence in practice as they may last over a few days therefore the sample extreme observations of each of the hazards are filtered by removing the repeated events within a four day time interval a total of 143 trivariate observed extremes are obtained and shown in fig 5 together with the rank based correlation measures spearman s ρ and kendall s τ the inter dependency between rainfall and river flow is found to be the strongest while that of rainfall and surge is the weakest the multivariate mutual independency test based on eq 4 shows strong inter dependencies between the three hazard variables therefore the inter dependencies between individual hazards cannot be neglected and copula functions will be used to estimate the joint multi hazard distribution to estimate the joint probability distribution as introduced in section 2 1 1 the univariate distribution functions are firstly fitted for each of the hazard variables the gev distribution is the best fitted margin for each of the hazards and their parameters are given in table 3 the parameters of the 3d gumbel clayton and frank copula functions listed in table 1 can be estimated using the maximum pseudo likelihood method which has been implemented in the copula r package as previously mentioned following the goodness of fit tests for these 3d copulas performed against the joint extreme observations the clayton trivariate copula with α 0 13 returns the best fit and is used for further analysis with the selected univariate margins and clayton trivariate copula function a 3d joint return period function can be derived from eq 8 the joint return periods can then be obtained for any given values of rainfall river flow and storm surge within the function domain a 2d distribution function of return period can also be generated when one of variables is fixed fig 6 presents the trivariate hazard surfaces for the joint return periods of 50 100 200 and 500 years within a hazard surface a monte carlo approach can be applied to create stochastic trivariate events of the same frequency of occurrence using random sampling 4 2 hydrodynamic modelling results for compound flooding as a fully hydrodynamic model hipims only involves two types of parameters including friction and infiltration for a simulation the friction is related to the manning coefficient to account for bed roughness the manning coefficient is usually estimated based on land use and other characteristics of land surface and can adopt values as suggested in a hydraulics text book e g chow 1959 infiltration is related to soil properties and conditions and may be neglected for extreme events xia et al 2019 herein before being applied to support multi hazard flood risk analysis hipims is first validated by reproducing three historical flood events inside or close to the greater london catchment to ensure its capability in representing multi source flooding processes in this area 4 2 1 model calibration and validation most of the river gauges inside the case study site are influenced by the tidal cycles and the flow stage records may not entirely reflect the flood peaks from the upstream catchment therefore the performance of hipims in reproducing rainfall runoff and flooding processes is evaluated in the upper lee catchment located outside of but close to the study site fig 7 a the river gauge at feildes weir records the outlet discharge from the catchment and is free from tidal influence the met office nimrod radar rainfall records available from the ceda archive http badc nerc ac uk are used to drive hipims and reproduce a flood event caused by heavy rainfall on 5th 8th february 2014 hipims is run on a uniform grid of 20 m resolution across the entire catchment with the manning coefficient for river channels and other rural catchment areas respectively set to 0 020 and 0 035 according to chow 1959 fig 7 b compares the simulated and observed flow hydrographs at the feildes weir gauge satisfactory agreement is achieved demonstrating that hipims can reliably predict the rainfall induced flooding process in this region to confirm its performance in predicting the flow flooding process influenced by both river flow and tide and or surge the observed sub daily river flow at kingston and the tidal level at sheerness from 31st march to 2nd april 2014 are used as boundary conditions to drive hipims to simulate the subsequent response the predicted time series of water level are compared with the observations at the eight gauges distributed along the considered reach of the river thames as shown in fig 8 the erith gauge recorded some suspicious values that are inconsistent with the trend of the periodic waves and thus removed by visual inspection after excluding the suspicious values it is evident that hipims captures reasonably well both the peak and the shape of the stage hydrographs at all eight gauges with the pearson s correlation coefficient all calculated to be greater than 0 93 therefore we may conclude that hipims can simulate the river flow processes influenced by ocean tides to further confirm hipims s capability in simulating coastal flooding induced by storm surge the 1953 north sea flood occured in the thames estuary is further considered which is one of the most devastating floods striking the east coast of london in history the event was described by steers 1953 who also provided the necessary tidal and surge data to support hydrodynamic flood modelling as the areas has experienced substantial development including construction of a series of flood defences including walls dikes and barriers after the event the present dem is not expected to well represent the terrain features in 1953 to better reproduce the flood event the current dem is corrected by removing the flood defence facilities according to their location height and construction time as specified in the uk flood defence dataset however uncertainties may still exist as we cannot sufficiently take into account the changes of landcover bathymetry and surface topography due to natural evolution and other engineering developments hipims is run for three days two days before the peak surge level and one day after to reproduce this historical flood event the simulated maximum flood extent is illustrated in fig 9 compared with the surveyed extent indicated by the red lines it should be noted that those areas that are not covered by the surveyed extent should not be interpreted as never been flooded during the event because the post event survey data strongly relies on subjective information provided by residents and the surveyors might miss out some less accessible areas in general most of flooded areas are successfully reproduced by hipims confirming its capability to support coastal flood modelling in the thames estuary 4 2 2 results of sample compound flood scenarios to simulate the compound flood scenarios to support the following multi hazard risk assessment hipims is set up for the whole greater london catchment at a uniform grid of 20 m spatial resolution the manning coefficient is set to 0 020 for river channels and 0 035 for the rest of the domain synthetic compound flood events are sampled from the 3d probability space through changing the three hazard variables three values are selected for each of the hazard variables evenly across the ranges of hazard observations and combined to construct a set of multi hazard samples i e 3 3 3 27 compound flood events to drive the hydrodynamic flood simulations to estimate the flood extent we define a grid cell as being flooded when its maximum water depth is larger than 0 3 m all of the 27 simulations last for 24 h and the results are shown in fig 10 as a 3d scatter plot to indicate the total flooded areas across the whole case study site the total inundated area is observed to increase as the hazard intensity i e the value of each of the three hazard variables increases which is as expected but the increasing rate is relatively small for river flow compared with the other two hazard variables indicating that the river flow i e fluvial flooding has the lowest impact on the overall inundation in this case study fig 11 shows two out of the 27 multi hazard inundation maps from the simulations as examples fig 11 a is the result of a 1 in 300 year event where the flooded area is mostly distributed along the river thames and the east coast with only a few discrete flooded spots of inundation away from the riverside caused by rainfall fig 11 b shows the result of the most extreme event as considered in all of the simulations in which the floodplains along the river thames have been mostly flooded and severe pluvial flooding can be also observed in many places across the domain but these individual inundation maps do not provide probability based information to show which areas are more likely to be flooded than the other this is because flood inundation of the same return period in different regions may be attributed to different hazard combinations and therefore the flooding may not be necessarily caused by the same drivers to quantify multi flood hazards locally it is necessary to separately analyse the flood simulation results in each of the grid cells to produce local hazard curves 4 2 3 inundation probability curves since the data and model parameters used to set up hipims remain unchanged across all of the simulations the model outputs e g the maximum inundation depth in each of the grid cells are a trivariate function of the three hazard variables that specify the rainfall river flow and tidal surge boundary conditions to drive the simulations the trivariate function is monotonically increasing in respect of each of the three hazard variables this means that it is reasonable to estimate the cell based maximum flood depth through interpolation of the results from a few typical simulations evenly and discretely distributed in the 3d space of the function domain based on this the cell based hazard curves can be produced through the following steps 1 specify a series of return periods e g ranging from 10 to 2000 years at a 10 year interval as considered in this work 2 for each of the return periods generate 1000 synthetic compound flood events using monte carlo simulation in the trivariate return period distribution space 3 calculate inundation results i e maximum inundation depths herein of these randomly generated events to avoid numerous expensive hydrodynamic model runs the maximum inundation depths are interpolated from the outputs of the 27 sample scenarios simulated by hipims as introduced in the previous section the interpolation of maximum depth is carried out in each of the computational cells inside the domain 4 extract the maximum value from these interpolated 1000 maximum inundation depths in each cell which defines the non exceeding inundation depth corresponding to the specific return period 5 repeat steps 2 4 for all of the return periods selected in step 1 to produce a series of maximum depth values corresponding to the specific return periods in each of the computational cells this effectively creates an inundation depth return period curve which is the cell based hazard curve defining the relationship between the inundation depth i e hazard and return period i e frequency of occurrence these cell based hazard curves may be further used to generate other types of hazard curves in any specific region covered by a certain number of computational cells for example we can produce a hazard curve to indicate the probability of inundated area in a specific region by counting the flooded cells fig 12 illustrates the hazard curves constructed for total inundated area due to compound flooding in the entire greater london catchment and similar curves can be generated for any regions 4 3 results of vulnerability and risk analysis 4 3 1 exposure and vulnerability curves in this work residential buildings are chosen as an example to demonstrate the adopted approaches in exposure and vulnerability analysis and the following multi hazard risk assessment for residential buildings the national property dataset npd provides geographical locations of properties but not the detail information related to property classification and valuation accordingly the exposure analysis adopted herein is focused on quantifying the number of residential buildings in each of the grid cells the result is illustrated in fig 13 a showing that the residential buildings are mostly distributed in the middle and western regions of the greater london catchment apart from the city centre where properties are densely distributed residential buildings along the downstream thames riversides and the coast e g gravesend the canvey island and southend are particularly vulnerable to extreme floods from multiple sources as revealed in the hazard map in fig 11 vulnerability analysis involves investigating the internal attributes and external environmental factors that may cause damage to the at risk elements to produce vulnerability curves or functions to show the relationship between the hazard inundation depth and or flow velocity and loss this work adopts the existing vulnerability analysis outcomes from mcm in the study area to test the proposed multi hazard risk assessment framework mcm provides vulnerability data for five types of residential buildings in the format of direct loss functions against inundation depth these vulnerability functions are linked to several scenarios according to flood warning levels including no warning 8 hour warning and 8 hour warning as the flood forecasting system is well established and continues to operate in the uk ballard et al 2016 it is assumed that the greater london catchment can receive the flood warning more than 8 h in advance the adopted flood depth damage curves for residential buildings are illustrated in fig 13 b the direct damage value of buildings is based on the 2017 price with previous data adjusted to account for inflation as the exposure data does not specify the detailed categories of the residential buildings in the research area we use the residential sector average curve to represent the vulnerability of all residential houses in each of the appraising cells 4 3 2 risk curves following the previous hazard vulnerability and exposure analyses multi hazard risk curves are established to quantify the probability of residential building loss in each of the computational cells eight of these risk curves are produced for different administrative districts in the great london catchment as illustrated in fig 14 the curves show that turrock and tower are subject to the highest level of compound flood risk in contrast the probability of residential building loss at southend on sea is the lowest and stays in zero loss for any potential events lower than 200 year return period this may be because this area is protected by well established flood defence systems for up to 200 year floods but is still at high risk of more extreme events driven by surges overtopping the sea walls 4 3 3 risk maps of average annual loss to better visualise the compound flood risk across the study domain a risk map is produced to visualize the annual average loss aal calculated from the risk curves at each of the cells to indicate the annual non exceedance probability of loss it should be noted that the aal is the mathematical expectation of the risk function and is a long period expectation meaning that such a loss is not expected to occur every year in this case the period refers to as the length of hazard records 67 years fig 15 presents the risk map obtained by plotting the non zero aal values at each of the grid cells over the whole domain it shows that the city centre area in the south bank of thames outstands by high aal values indicating that the residential buildings in this area are subject to high risk of loss from compound flooding however whilst the inundation map as shown in fig 11 indicates that the south bank of the thame estuary is easy to be flooded the aal in this area is almost zero because of very few buildings are located here clearly the risk map provides an effective means to spatially visualise and compare loss prediction across the domain 5 discussion and conclusions this work presents a multi hazard risk assessment framework to consider the inter dependencies and interactions between multiple hazard drivers and produce fully quantitative results of the compound flood risk driven by high river flow heavy rainfall and extreme surge the risk outputs are presented as risk curves of loss frequency function and risk maps of expected average annual loss the risk curves give a probabilistic estimation of loss induced by compound flooding in each of the computational cells the risk map illustrates the overall pattern of the risk level in the whole case study area compared with some of the existing multi hazard risk assessment approaches the proposed framework allows fully quantitative estimation of multi hazard risk from compound flooding and is therefore able to provide more information to support regional planning and flood risk management a few assumptions and simplifications have been made to reduce the complexity of the proposed framework and make large scale hydrodynamic simulations computationally feasible to support the fully quantitative multi hazard risk assessment the sub daily variation of all of the three hazard variables and the spatial variation of rainfall over the greater london catchment are neglected to reduce the dimensions in joint probability analysis and avoid the exponential increase of the number of multi hazard flood simulations as required this contributes to a main source of uncertainties in the hydrodynamic modelling and risk assessment process in this work other potential uncertainties worth mentioning include due to the limited sample size of the measured hazard data uncertainties may exist in the fitted joint probability and return period distributions these uncertainties are measurable according to the number of extreme events in the case study site and can be reduced if a longer series of hazard records are available for medium return periods however even hazard records may span over a century flood frequency analysis for longer return periods over 100 year may still be subject to high uncertainties these uncertainties may be controlled by incorporating data from instrumental observations non expert documentations or natural records of historical floods as interpreted by paleohydrologists st george and mudelsee 2019 a hydrodynamic model requires much fewer parameters than a hydrological model in flood modelling which effectively reduces the uncertainties related to model parameters and calibration however due to the limited availability of observed data for calibrating hipims for compound flood modelling uncertainties still inevitably exist in the simulation results only 27 compound flood scenarios have been simulated in the case study such a small sample group will bring great uncertainties to the risk assessment results to well represent the 3d space of multi hazard millions of joint events or even more may need to be simulated which is unrealistic for hydrodynamic modelling for such a high resolution and large scale case study this challenging issue may be addressed by developing effective machine learning techniques to predict flood inundation kabir et al 2020 to substantially reduce computational cost in the future the uncertainty in the vulnerability curves is a typical contributor to the final uncertainties in the risk curves a more comprehensive data collection and analysis process can help refine the probability damage functions curves and reduce the related uncertainties multi hazard risk assessment is especially valuable to the regions affected by inter dependent multiple water related hazards for example tropical cyclones can directly lead to storm surge in coastal areas and meanwhile bring heavy rainfall that may simultaneous cause pluvial and fluvial flooding the risk assessment framework can be applied in these regions to better understand and quantify compound flood risk to inform regional planning and the

3538,integration of petrophysical and geological information is critical to simulation of subsurface carbon storage gcs in this sense two depositional facies were identified from the core description and well log interpretation namely massive ms and cross bedded cb facies groups additionally pore scale characteristics were studied by a combination of techniques e g nuclear magnetic resonance nmr and mercury intrusion capillary pressure micp scanning electron microscope sem and petrographic analyses show that the pore structure is dominantly controlled by the depositional environment and dolomite cementation nmr t2 distributions of ms and cb facies show triple and quadruple modes respectively in addition micp of high and low permeability ms facies samples and their cb facies group mixtures were collected the ms sample pore throat size distribution is uni modal while the triple modal characteristic of the mixtures indicates heterogeneous pore structures at the sub core scale for cb facies the reliably estimates of porosity and permeability for both facies groups via nmr techniques and the mlr multiple linear regression approach demonstrate the applicability of these techniques to eolian sandstone moreover irreducible water saturation via the t 2 cutoff method correlates strongly with t 2lm instead of porosity finally the rock quality index and flow zone indicator were calculated based on combinable magnetic resonance cmr log interpretations this provides direct connection to properties measured in the well four flow units were classified for both facies groups results show that better reservoir quality with significant heterogeneities is observed in the cb facies this study highlights the importance integrating multiscale petrophysical properties including facies pore architecture and diagenesis analysis with core to log scale property characterization the results herein validate our reservoir characterization and flow unit classification in eolian

holds more than one third of u s coal reserves at producing mines accounting for about two fifths of all coal mined in the united states in 2018 u s energy information administration 2020 coal mined in the powder river basin prb located in northeastern wyoming is mainly used at power plants large quatities of carbon dioxide co2 emissions from coal power plants contribute to the rising atmospheric co2 concentration and thus to climate change ipcc 2013 therefore substantial and sustained reduction of greenhouse gas emissions especially co2 are required if thermal coal is to remain relevant as a fuel in electricity generation geologic carbon storage gcs has been extensively explored as a feasible technology in recent years saghafi et al 2007 godec et al 2013 gong and gu 2015 jiang et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 yu et al 2021 the dry fork station dfs storage complex located in the prb was selected to evaluate the potential for co2 storage including assessment of storage capacity reservoir petrophysical properties and the sealing capacity of the cap rocks a stratigraphic well the uwprb 1 was drilled near the dry fork station and the primary studies identified the lakota formation the hulett member of the lower sundance formation and the upper minnelusa formation as potential reservoirs to satisfy co2 volumetric storage requirements of the carbon storage assurance facility enterprise carbonsafe project as one of the main storage targets the eolian minnelusa sandstone reservoirs in the prb comprise a series of stacked dunes interdunes and sand sheets resulting in drastic variations within sedimentary lithofacies in a short vertical and lateral range jorgensen and james 1988 chandler et al 1989 in addition the very fine sand deposited within the same facies such as stacked dunes also introduce heterogeneities at multiple scales starting at the sub core down to the pore cale for instance the high angle avalanche beds are separated by the typically finer grained grainfall sediments which often become permeability barriers within the sand sequence diagenesis is another important factor influencing heterogeneities which is a function of depositional environment cement precipitation and dissolution sand composition and burial history and can dramatically alter the pore structure krystinik 1990 schenk 1990 kou et al 2021 many eolian deposits with consistent mineralogy and good porosity development were intensely cemented by anhydrite and or dolomite the multi length scale heterogeneity of petrophysical properties and their spatial distribution can translate into distinct characteristics of the subsurface fluid rock system such as pore architecture porosity permeability and irreducible water saturation or a combination of these these petrophysical characteristics negatively impact co2 injectivity flow regimes migration and storage capacity thus raising significant uncertainties in gcs projects krevor et al 2011 al bayati et al 2019 liu et al 2019 chen et al 2021 han et al 2021 as the co2 injectivity flow regimes trapping mechanisms migration and storage capacity vary with rock types especially for eolian sandstones reservoir rocks classification is necessary for geological modeling and reservoir simulation for gcs padhi et al 2014 wei et al 2014 singh 2018 al bayati et al 2019 newell et al 2019 zheng et al 2021 rock typing consists of classifying distinct units of reservoir rocks by employing lithofacies petrophysical rock pore properties rock fluid interactions and or historic production injection performances gunter et al 1997 guo et al 2007 rebelle and lalanne 2014 several clustering methods can be used in reservoir characterization rebelle and lalanne 2014 1 geology driven clustering 2 porosity permeability driven clustering 3 cut off based clustering 4 capillary pressure driven clustering 5 logs driven clustering and 6 dynamic driven clustering methods currently rock typing studies more likely rely on linking two or more clustering methods salman and bellah 2009 rebelle et al 2009 skalinski and kenter 2015 chandra et al 2015 farshi et al 2019 however as opposed to oil gas reservoirs where abundant data have been collected during exploration and development stages available data for deep saline aquifers for gcs are limited the objectives of this study are 1 multiscale petrophysical properties characterization and 2 classification of flow units of the minnelusa eolian sandstones at the uwprb 1 these objectives depend on characterization and analysis tasks in this sense links between pore scale characteristics with core scale properties i e porosity permeability and the irreducible water saturation were investigated then these petrophysical properties interpreted from well log data were analyzed finally reservoir quality index rqi and flow zone indicator fzi were calculated using data interpreted from schlumberger combinable magnetic resonance cmr log and the discrete rock types drt were classified as the flow units which can be employed in the 3d geological modeling and reservoir simulation of co2 injection in the eolian units results in this study also provide a comprehensive understanding of petrophysical properties in multiscale and flow capacity of different flow units in the eolian minnelusa sandstones to provide a better reference for field operations 2 geological settings the powder river basin prb as shown in fig 1 is located in northeastern wyoming and southeastern montana the basin developed during the laramide orogenic tectonic shortening is asymmetric with the synoformal axis oriented approximately north south along the western third of the structure basin bounding features including the black hills and hartville uplift on the east laramie range and casper arch to the south bighorn mountains and the hardin platform on the west and the miles city arch bull mountains and porcupine dome on the north were shown anna 2009 the upper minnelusa formation at the dry fork station dfs storage complex located in the upper right quadrant of the state and in the region where the uwprb 1 test well was drilled consists of varying interbedded marine dolomites and eolian sandstones deposited during several cycles of transgression and regression in permo pennsylvanian time george 1984 jorgensen and james 1988 each cycle was terminated by a rapidly rising sea level that deposited carbonates and evaporites of the next cycle george 1984 the sandstone intervals of the upper minnelusa sandstones are commonly labeled alphabetically fig 1 but do not always correlate across the basin entirely at the uwprb 1 test well minnelusa b c and d sandstones are recognized near dfs the upper minnelusa sandstone intervals contain the best reservoir intervals with the highest porosity and permeability and can be productive hydrocarbon reservoirs and dispersed fields exist across much of the eastern margin of the basin anna 2009 porosity evolution of the minnelusa sandstones is largely a function of depositional environment early anhydrite cementation burial compaction and later anhydrite dissolution as well as quartz and dolomite cementation minor diagenetic alterations such as illite and pyrite growth multigenerational feldspar and dolomite dissolution and growth and modifications of early clay grain coatings do not significantly add to the evolution of porosity schenk 1990 permeability of the eolian sandstone complex is highly impacted by stratigraphic architecture and cementation which could yield a range of values several orders of magnitude between or within distinct facies such as dune interdune and or sabkha deposits the lateral and vertical stacking of eolian and sabkha deposits lead to the heterogeneity of permeability at the macroscale in addition the direction of the greatest permeability is usually perpendicular to the wind direction of dune face formation and parallel to the long axis of the dune within bedding sets at the microscale a change in grain size at the base of the dune and cementation due to capillary action and evaporation of sulphate and calcium rich fluids can create potential barriers within the dune complex which further leads to the complex permeability distributions these natural barriers are reflected in minnelusa oil fields which commonly exhibit a limited water drive being indicative of confinement from surface and other reservoirs anna 2009 however as a storage system it provides attractive qualities for potential gcs reservoir consideration the regionally extended caprock of the upper minnelusa formation is the permian opeche shale which serves as a regionally extensive confining layer moreover the lower cycles of the upper minnelusa sandstones within the study area are confined by carbonates which are most often sealing finally the dry fork station is located close to the uwprb 1 test well and provides a co2 emission source which makes the storage complex in the prb a suitable candidate for commercial carbon dioxide capture and storage 3 materials and methods 3 1 materials synthetic or surrogate brines used to saturate core plugs were prepared following the composition shown in table 1 down hole formation brine samples from the minnelusa b c and d sandstones provided the basis for the synthetic brines all brines were prepared in the laboratory by dissolving specified amounts of analytic grade salts in deionized water after mixing brines were filtered and degassed under vacuum before use rock plugs 38 1 mm in diameter of the minnelusa formation were drilled from core samples recovered from the uwprb 1 core samples were cleaned in soxhlet extractors using toluene and methanol and oven dried at 100 c for 24 h 3 2 experimental methods routine core porosity and permeability measured using nitrogen at a net confining pressure of 6 9 mpa 1000 psi were carried out using a coreval 700 porosimeter and permeameter vinci technologies france properties of each sample are summarized in table 2 samples prepared for the thin section were trimmed from the core plug ends and pore structures were determined by thin section analyses and revealed by blue dyed epoxy small rock pieces from the trimmed parts were carbon coated for sem imaging samples from the ms facies group high and low permeability and their mixtures from the cb facies group were cut adjacent to the core plugs for micp measurement the experiment was conducted at core laboratories petro services denver co using an autopore v instrument micromeritics instrument corporation distribution of pore throat radius can be obtained from the micp curves as 1 r 2 σ cos θ pc s hg where σ the interfacial tension of the mercury air is 0 48 n m pc is capillary pressure θ contact angle of mercury air commonly equals 140 s hg is the mercury saturation proton nuclear magnetic resonance 1h nmr t2 relaxation time also known as transverse relaxation time was used to estimate the pore size distribution t2 relaxation mechanisms are described in our previous publication wang et al 2018 in addition nmr t2 spectra have been frequently used for permeability estimation in both laboratory and well logging kenyon 1997 coates et al 1999 alvarado et al 2003 ren et al 2019 as pore throat size is believed to correlate strongly with pore body size for most sandstone two of the most commonly used models for permeability estimation are the semiempirical schlumberger doll research sdr and the timur coates tc or free fluid model the sdr model is based on kenyon relationship kenyon et al 1988 kenyon 1992 using measurements of sandstone permeability k porosity ϕ and the logarithm mean value of the t2 distribution t 2 lm as expressed in eq 2 coates et al 1991 developed the timur coates model based on the bound fluid porosity bfi and the free fluid porosity ffi shown in eq 3 2 k sdr c 1 ϕ 4 t 2 lm 2 3 k tc c 2 ϕ 4 ffi bfi 2 where c 1 and c 2 are empirical coefficients ϕ is fractional porosity k sdr and k tc are in md 3 3 well log data wireline logs such as gamma ray spontaneous potential sonic transit time neutron and density were collected in the uwprb 1 porosity interpreted by regressing commonly used log variables i e density log rhoz thermal neutron log nphi and sonic log dtco from uwprb 1 well against core measured values using the multi linear regression mlr approach was also studied here porosity is expressed as ϕ mlr a 1 rhoz a 2 nphi a 3 dtco a 0 where a 0 to a 3 are fitting parameters for the mlr approach the core and log data were employed as input parameters for each facies group and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator or lasso regression analysis method was employed the loss function l1 norm was used to minimize the sum of the absolute values of the model coefficients between the measured and predicted results by the linear approximation in addition the cmr log was also acquired using schlumberger s cmr plus well logging tool primary outputs include transverse relaxation time t2 distribution the logarithmic mean value of t2 total matrix independent porosity free and bound fluid porosity the output results allow permeability calculation using the sdr and tc models eliminating the need for physical samples 3 4 fluid unit classification many methods that consider petrophysical attributes are commonly used for core based hydraulic rock typing such as reservoir quality index rqi leverett 1941 winland s r35 pittman 1992 and flow zone indicator fzi amaefule et al 1993 among these methods the fzi technique has been successfully used in many studies to characterize hydraulic units amaefule et al 1993 guo et al 2007 gunter et al 1997 the technique is based on a modified kozeny carmen equation and the concept of mean hydraulic radius the reservoir quality index rqi and the normalized porosity index ϕ z were calculated based on eq 4 while the fzi was estimated by eq 5 4 ϕ z ϕ e 1 ϕ e rqi 0 0314 k ϕ e 5 fzi rqi ϕ z where k is permeability md ϕ e is the effective porosity fraction the effective porosity in this study was obtained from the free fluid porosity ffi and permeability was calculated from the sdr model the discrete rock type drt that is often employed in geological modeling and reservoir simulation was calculated using eq 6 6 drt round 2 ln fzi 10 6 4 results and discussion 4 1 depositional features and facies classification the eolian sandstones are composed of three units at uwprb 1 minnelusa b c and d fig 2 which were identified from the well logs and core descriptions the yellow fields enveloped between the neutron and density porosity curves together with the help of core description identify the sandstones in view of the limitations of core descriptions lacking extent enough to adequately describe the lithofacies subgroups of upper minnelusa reliably massive laminar bedded and cross bedded stratigraphy are utilized laminar bedded and cross bedded differences may not be discernable at a scale relevant to this investigation therefore in this study laminar and cross bedded are grouped as cross bedded facies group group 2 and the remaining massive stratigraphy is characterized as massive facies group group 1 shown in fig 2 stratigraphic features within the studied depth interval were identified with the help of a 190 ft core recovered from well uwprb 1 the minnelusa b unit lies at the top of the upper minnelusa formation in this core a 20 ft massive sandstone including hydrocarbon and transition zones was found on top of the minnelusa b sandstone min b ss but is not the focus of this study the lower part of the min b ss is mainly comprised of a mottled dolomitic massive facies facies group 2 which is 5 ft thick buff to pink fine grained to very fine grained cross bedded dolomitic sandstone are observed and portions are very faintly bedded to massive figs 3 a and b are cross bedded and laminar facies from the minnelua b sandstone which contain ripple produced strata the wind ripple facies has thin laminated millimeter scale pin stripe beds the set of inversely graded strata comprises secondary porosity after dolomite dissolution an interesting aspect of the core in fig 3a is the presence of the v marker above which is thin cross bedded millimeter scale sand sheet facies the minnelusa c unit comprises cross bedded and massive facies groups and a 6 ft thick dolostone the massive facies groups on top and in the middle of the minnelusa c unit depict gray to pink fine grained to very fine grained massive dolomitic sandstone with multiple wavy mud layers fig 3e while for the massive group on the bottom of the minnelusa c unit gray to buff fine grained to very fine grained massive dolomitic sandstone mottled with dark gray dolostone was observed the dark gray very fine grained mottling is dolomitic and made visible by diagentic alteration in addition it contains wavy dolomitic mud bands and pink carbonate layers up to 10 cm thick are present in lower portion the cross bedded facies group located in the middle of the minnelusa c unit presents gray to pink fine grained to very fine grained cross bedded dolomitic sandstone with interspersed medium grained layers fig 3d consists of stacks of flat fine laminae which might be deposited at interdune or sand sheet differentiating inter dune from sand sheet deposits based on sedimentary structure alone is hard in the minnelusa as structures are similar in these two facies in modern environment fryberger 1984 compared to units b and c the thickness of the minnelusa d sandstone is only 17 ft it presents gray fine grained to very fine grained dolomitic sandstone the massive facies group is located on the upper portion with a thin dolostone layer base while the lower portion is cross bedded facies group shown in fig 2 figs 3g and h show examples of the upper massive and the lower cross bedded facies groups the cross bedded facies group of the d unit mainly comprises sand sheet produced strata carbonate cycles including a b c and d dolomites at uw prb 1 examples are shown in figs 3c and i deposited as the water table began to rise in low areas between the dunes during the regression time the minnelusa a dolomite overlies on the top of the minnelusa b sand and is very thin minnelusa b dolomite has gray micritic and vuggy moldic dolostone with interspersed anhydrite portions of the dolostone are recrystallized and the extent of fracturing varies throughout the member moreover stylolites and mud layers up to 1 cm in thickness are present similar to the b dolomite the minnelusa c dolomite also shows gray to pink micritic to vuggy moldic dolostone the top portions of the c dolomite and most of the minnelusa d dolomite were highly fractured micritic dolostone shown in figs 3f and h even though the c and d dolomites were fractured the large salinity differences shown in table 1 indicate that they are sealed at the well site 4 2 pore structure characterization 4 2 1 sem and thin section analysis sem analysis of rock samples from the minnelusa reservoir intervals was utilized to unveil pore architecture and understand mineral constituents as they occur in pore and pore throat volumes from different facies the samples from core plugs mh6 and mh13 shown in figs 4a and b were used for this comparison fig 4a from the minnelusa c sand is variably laminar and massive bedded from dune face and interdune input showing a variety of grain size distributions average size from 30 μ m to 400 μ m resulting in pore size variability both microcrystalline dolomite and anhydrite occur as cements with lenticular nodules being associated with bedding strata fig 4b shows an sem image of core sample mh13 which is distinctive of massive bedded interdune material of relatively homogeneous grain size resulting in similar pore size it exhibits prevalent microcrystalline dolomite cementation which is the primary mineral after quartz in this sample cement often occurs as nodules with intergranular texture and associated carbonate bound secondary pore networks throughout the sample and is apparently not associated with bedding like sample mh6 thin section analysis was used to describe the stratigraphic type pore structure and mineralogy of minnelusa sands collected from uwprb 1 from thin section scale analysis three primary stratigraphy types emerged these are massive bedded with variable sorting laminar bedded with moderate sorting and variable cementation and cross bedded moderately sorted with variable cementation laminar bedded samples may be cross bedded or horizontally deposited interdune material depending on location in the dune field deposition environment figs 4c f show examples of the four thin sections derived strata descriptions and the sample identification are as follows sample mh6 cross bedded fig 4 c moderately to poorly sorted sub rounded to rounded quartz dominated with average grain size ranging from 30 to 400 μ m this sample exhibits both matrix and grain supported areas though grain supported matrix is dominant microcrystalline dolomite cement and anhydrite cement are prevalent and are the primary mineral after quartz in this sample often occurring in nodules anhydrite tends to occur in lenticular nodules associated with bedding the largest primary grains tend to be rounded to well rounded with finer grain materials being more angular in character potassium feldspar occurring 5 10 of the mineralogy is present mostly as a secondary mineral though relic grains do exist opaque minerals occur within the majority of microcrystalline dolomite cements which occupy most pore space edges though not all pores are cemented dolomite cements where no associated with nodules tend to be grain surface coatings with open pore space remaining between most quartz grains sample mh7 laminar bedded fig 4 e laminar bedded moderately to poorly sorted sub rounded to rounded quartz dominated bedding is defined by depositional grain packing rather than grain size primary grains range from 40 to 420 μ m though other intervals of this facies have grain sizes ranging from 40 to 300 μ m this sample exhibits both matrix and grain supported areas though grain supported matrix is dominant microcrystalline dolomite cement is the most abundant mineral after quartz in this sample often occurring in clusters and grain coatings anhydrite tends to occur in lenticular nodules associated with bedding the largest primary quartz grains tend to be rounded to well rounded with finer grain materials being more angular in character potassium feldspar occurring 5 10 of the mineralogy is dominantly as a secondary mineral though relic grains do exist opaque minerals occur within the majority of microcrystalline dolomite cements which occupy most pore space edges though not all pores are cemented sample mh13 massive bedded fig 4 d is a well sorted sub rounded to rounded grain supported quartz sandstone primary grains with average size range from 50 to 140 μ m with rare larger grains occurring up to 220 μ m in diameter micro crystalline dolomite cement is prevalent and is the primary mineral after quartz in this sample often occurring as nodules with intergranular texture and associated secondary pore networks and as grain coatings distributed throughout the pore network potassium feldspar occurring less than 5 of the mineralogy is dominantly as a secondary mineral occurring as grain coatings along pore boundaries though relic grains do exist opaque minerals occur within the majority of microcrystalline dolomite cements which occupy most pore space edges minor anhydrite cement is present in a few pores sample mh17 massive bedded fig 4 f is a moderately well sorted sub angular to sub rounded grain supported quartz with average size ranging from 50 to 160 μ m apparent porosity is very good compared to sample mh13 microcrystalline dolomite cement is present in small amounts occurring as nodules with intergranular texture with associated secondary pore networks and as single grains adhered to quartz grain boundaries potassium feldspar makes up approximately 3 to 5 of the mineralogy and is dominantly as a secondary mineral occurring as grain coatings along pore boundaries though relic grains do exist opaque minerals make up less than 1 of the rock and most often occur with potassium feldspar the above descriptions indicate that the differences between laminar and cross bedded lithologies from thin section descriptions are too small to be considered different grain sorting grain size variability with exception of a few larger grains cementation occurrence and secondary mineral occurrence are all similar in contrast the difference between bedded laminar and or cross bedded and massive minnelusa facies is obvious from thin section images sorting of massive bedded intervals is better than that of laminar and cross bedded the overall grain size is smaller within massive bedded intervals as well as being less variable in range and secondary depositional minerals such as potassium feldspar are less prevalent 4 2 2 nmr t2 distribution t2 distribution of selected samples that represent cb and ms facies groups are shown in fig 5 the nmr t2 spectra of cross bedded plugs shown in fig 5a show the triple and quadrimodal distributions for the mh6 and mh7 samples respectively t2 values of the rightmost peak t 2 rmp that corresponds to the dominant pore spaces are 204 and 508 ms respectively the micropores which are usually poorly connected correspond to the short relaxation time components the complexity of the bedding structures in the eolian deposition resulted from heterogeneities from pore to sub core scales first grain sizes of the dune sandstone are larger in comparison to those in the ripple sand sheet leading to larger pore sizes further mechanical compaction and pressure solution could further result in smaller t2 for micro meso and macropores second with respect to the pore scale heterogeneity an important influencing factor at sub core scale is dolomite cement cement content at the high permeability layers is much smaller than that of the lower permeability layers the larger peaks are contributed by the pore spaces from the higher permeability layers while the middle peak correspond to the pore spaces mainly from the lower permeability layers consequently compared to mh7 the smaller grain size and larger dolomite content contribute to the disappearance of the rightmost peak observed in sample mh6 the nmr t2 spectra of massive plugs show the triple modal distributions shown in fig 5b the disordered packing in massive sandstone with minor changes in the ordering of the individual grains results in wider range of pore types in comparison with those in the cross bedded samples furthermore pink to gray dolomitic cement together with finer carbonate stringers leads to the smaller pore type which corresponds to the leftmost peak in the t2 distribution in comparison with the sample mh17 sample mh11 has the very fine grains and higher microcrystalline dolomite cement which result in the triple modal distribution and smaller t2 in addition the number of the pores corresponding to the middle peak is larger than that of the rightmost peak the pore filling dolomite cement reduces the size of the larger pores directly increasing the population of the micropores 4 2 3 micp pore throat size distributions ptsd shown in fig 6 were derived from micp curves using eq 1 pores are assumed cylindrical the ptsd of the massive sample is uni modal with the peak at 8 1 μ m even though the size of the dominant pore spaces is uniform the wide distribution indicates the existence of smaller pores in contrast the high and low permeability layers of the cross bedded sample show a bi modal characteristic while the mixture shows a triple modal characteristic indicating the complexity of their pore structures it is interesting to notice that for both massive and mixture samples the number of the peaks from ptsd is different from that of t2 distributions the different characteristics have been reported in previous studies and can be attributed to several causes wang et al 2018 wu et al 2019 first due to the heterogeneity the amount of rock pieces used in the micp experiment cannot fully represent core plug used for t2 measurement secondly based on eq 1 micp measures the pore throat size i e pore entry radii and cannot fully represent the size of the pore body while nmr t2 estimates both the pore body and throat sizes 4 3 petrophysical properties characterization 4 3 1 laboratory porosity and permeability cross plots of nitrogen porosity and permeability are shown in fig 7 the massive and cross bedded facies groups have average porosity and permeability of 0 067 and 3 724 md and 0 085 and 16 5 md respectively the coefficients of determination r 2 of the exponential relations are 0 94 and 0 76 for the massive and cross bedded facies groups respectively moreover fig 7 shows that porosity and permeability of the cb facies group have a large overlap with that of the ms facies group and the former group possesses higher porosity and permeability this is because petrophysical characteristics of the eolian sandstones are a function of dynamic depositional environment lithofacies variations and digenetic processes in the well uwprb 1 an excellent zone with high porosity and permeability occurs at the top of the minnelusa b sandstone which is largely composed of massive sandstone such as the reworking of the avalanche dune front in contrast for massive sandstone deposited at tubular conditions cements like mottled or banding dolomitic carbonate and carbonate mud stringers result in the low porosity and permeability for the cross bedded facies group higher porosity and permeability for grainflow or avalanche deposits but low angle and planar interdune deposits i e wadi ripple and grainfall deposits have low porosity and permeability because of cementation or very fine to fine grain packing for example the ripple sandstones were well cemented soon after deposition in addition digenetic processes such as cementation pressure solution mineral dissolution and authigenic mineral nucleation can influence the quality of the rocks for both facies groups which is clearly shown from the sem and thin section images in fig 4 the sem image shown in fig 4b illustrates the relationship between authigenic rhombohedral dolomite grains and larger detrital grains as well as the in fill of primary porosity by cements figs 4d and e indicate that cementation is among the most important porosity reducing diagenetic process these pore scale reducing effect not only directly reduces porosity but also permeability in addition to the laboratory measurements permeability was also estimated from the nmr relaxation data using the sdr and tc models listed in table 2 the laboratory and estimated permeability correlate well fig 8 coefficients c 1 and c 2 are 5 40 8 79 and 1 60e 5 8 94e 4 for the ms cb facies groups to evaluate the accuracy of permeability estimated from the nmr relaxation data the pearson correlation coefficients r between the laboratory and nmr approach for the ms and the cb facies groups were calculated which are 0 93 0 95 for the sdr model and 0 93 0 79 for the tc model respectively the good correlations indicate the advantage of permeability estimation using the nmr techniques 4 3 2 porosity and permeability from well log interpretation porosity along the wellbore was obtained directly from the cmr log based on the coefficients c 1 and c 2 obtained from the previous section permeability was estimated through the sdr and tc models in addition porosity was interpreted by the mlr approach the fitting parameters a 0 to a 3 for the cross bedded and massive groups for the mlr approach are 1 08 0 34 0 19 0 0049 and 2 20 0 73 2257 00 0 0041 respectively then permeability was calculated based on the relationships with porosity shown in fig 7 fig 9 shows porosity and permeability results from laboratory measurement cmr log and mlr approaches porosity and permeability interpreted from cmr log show that high porosity and permeability zones are found in the minnelusa b sandstone and the cross bedded facies zones of the minnelusa c sandstone while for the massive facies zones in the minnelusa c sandstone the formation quality is low in addition the variation in vertical direction suggests that the c sandstone is more heterogeneous even though the minnelusa d sandstone is thin 17 ft the relatively high porosity and permeability values could make it a storage zone it is worth noticing the values of porosity and permeability obtained from the mlr approach at the top of minnelusa b sandstone are lower than those estimated by the other two methods well log based this is the result of extrapolation without proper laboratory measurement constraints missing at the top of the interval this illustrates the disadvantage of mlr approach which depends on the laboratory measurements and their coverage along the well log depth 4 3 3 irreducible water saturation in contrast to oil gas reservoirs co2 injectivity storage capacity and migration are three key factors for commercial gcs projects that means not only high enough porosity and permeability but a lower irreducible water saturation is desirable irreducible water s wir is defined as the fraction of water that remains trapped after displacement with a nonwetting phase morrow 1970 in general higher clay bound water is a direct consequence of higher clay volume fraction and a higher capillary bound water saturation indicates complex pore geometry and networks which results from cementation nmr t2 spectrum directly reflects the pore size distribution in fully saturated rock herein an empirical t2 cut off value of 33 ms was used to split the t2 spectrum into bound water 33 ms and free water 33 ms fig 10 shows s wir histograms calculated from cmr t2 spectra of the two facies groups the irreducible water saturation varies from 0 0 to 0 8 with an average of 0 27 and 0 15 for the ms and cb facies groups respectively in this study larger content of the dolomite cements which might produce tight porosity similar to that related to clays for the massive facies group might result in larger irreducible water saturation in addition the by pass effect due to high seepage resistance high capillary pressure dominates locally as the heterogeneity of pore structures mainly exits at the pore level while at the core scale the irreducible water saturation might be homogeneously distributed for the massive facies group in contrast for the cross bedded facies group the by pass effect is pronounced at the core level because of the lower permeability zones from where the bound water volume mainly comes while for the higher permeability zones which possess the most pore spaces the irreducible water saturation is mainly controlled by the pore level by pass effect to further investigate the dominant influencing factors on s wir the relationships between s wir with ϕ cmr and t 2lm are depicted in fig 11 fig 11a shows that the irreducible water saturation decreases with the increase of porosity however the negative correlation is weak for both facies groups indicating that porosity has less impact on s wir for both facies groups s wir is also inversely proportional to t 2 lm as shown in fig 11b the relative good trends denoted by the values of r 2 which are weakly correlated to porosity indicate that the irreducible water saturation is mainly related to the rock type different correlations for different types and consequently controlled by pore structure 4 4 flow unit classification fig 12 shows that the high quality intervals are mainly located in the cross bedded facies group of the minnelusa b c and d sands indicating that the main co2 flow zones would occur in these intervals for the massive facies group the overall poor quality would result in lower co2 injectivity and storage capacity four drt units 11 12 13 and 14 were subdivided shown in fig 12 the flow units 13 and 14 exhibit good reservoir quality with favorable porosity and permeability and smaller irreducible water saturation fig 13 in contrast flow units 11 and 12 are not favorable to co2 flow capacity due to lower porosity and permeability and larger irreducible water saturation fig 13 depicts the thickness of different flow units for both groups and the cross plots of their corresponding porosity and permeability respectively the total thickness of the flow units 13 and 14 for the cross bedded facies group is 87 ft with 50 ft of good quality flow unit 14 for the massive facies group the total thickness of the flow units 13 and 14 is 69 ft with only 30 ft for flow unit 4 and the thickness of flow unit 2 is up to 46 ft in addition to the quality of the flow units their continuity and variation along the well depth also play an important role in the co2 injectivity and its profile examination of the flow units in minnelusa b and d sandstones shows that these units are less variable implying that the co2 injectivity profile is more homogeneous flow units in the c sandstone vary within a short distance which should lead to more heterogeneous co2 injectivity profile even though the tight zones can act as barriers to hinder the migration of co2 in the vertical direction they would also cause co2 fingering through high permeability zones which would lead to a lower sweep efficiency thus the co2 storage capacity would be reduced and the co2 plume size would be enlarged 5 conclusions and implications for gcs in eolian reservoirs in this paper the multiscale petrophysical characterization was performed for the minnelusa b c and d sandstones to evaluate geological carbon storage while geological compelxity is inherent to these eolian systems the research results in this work led to the classification of the two main facies groups massive and cross bedded through identification of depositional features for the massive facies group the interdune strata show massive grain packing and the reservoir quality is mainly controlled by diagenetic effects the cross bedded facies group is characterized as pore to core scale cross or laminar bedded sandstones depositional environments and dolomite cement content are the two dominant influencing factors on reservoir qualities furthermore laboratory t2 distributions and micp show the complex pore structure for the cb facies group while for the ms facies pore throat size are broader and more uniform routine porosity and permeability measurements of both facies groups show good relationships permeability estimated by the sdr and the tc models using laboratory t2 distribution and cmr logging data and porosity obtained from the cmr log show good correlation with experimental measurements indicating the advantage of the nmr techniques in petrophysical characterization of eolian reservoirs compared to conventional well logs by employing the classified facies groups and effective porosity and permeability interpreted from cmr log four discrete rock types were determined for the two facies groups moreover the value of the classification method can be additionally appreciated by trends of irreducible water saturation that strongly correlate to the classified rock groups this is an indication of the internal consistency of our classification method the thicknesses of the flow units 13 and 14 for the cross bedded facies groups are larger than that of the massive designating it as the high potential co2 injection zones the results can be used as the primary data to predict the flow unit variation across the area of interest and as the input data for 3d geological modeling and co2 injection simulation the findings in this study have broader implications for not only geological carbon storage but also co2 enhanced oil recovery in eolian reservoirs furthermore results will also help to understand pore to log scale reservoir characteristics models involving grain parameters may not be adequate to appropriately predict permeability within an eolian reservoir because higher and lower permeability eolian facies do not always have resolvable porosity differences the appropriate flow units partitioning of eolian reservoirs should be performed based on the geological facies characterization and classification even though co2 injectivity for the good units of cb facies group is more suitable for gcs than the ms facies group in view of the reservoir quality and thickness co2 storage capacity and migration in the cb facies group is worse due to the multi scale heterogeneities and lower volumetric sweep efficiency kou et al 2021 in addition as less data are available in the study area the lateral continuity also increases the uncertainty of the commercialization of the gcs further exploration including drilling a new test well conducting a 3d seismic survey performing cross well interference test are proposed in phase iii of the project

3538,integration of petrophysical and geological information is critical to simulation of subsurface carbon storage gcs in this sense two depositional facies were identified from the core description and well log interpretation namely massive ms and cross bedded cb facies groups additionally pore scale characteristics were studied by a combination of techniques e g nuclear magnetic resonance nmr and mercury intrusion capillary pressure micp scanning electron microscope sem and petrographic analyses show that the pore structure is dominantly controlled by the depositional environment and dolomite cementation nmr t2 distributions of ms and cb facies show triple and quadruple modes respectively in addition micp of high and low permeability ms facies samples and their cb facies group mixtures were collected the ms sample pore throat size distribution is uni modal while the triple modal characteristic of the mixtures indicates heterogeneous pore structures at the sub core scale for cb facies the reliably estimates of porosity and permeability for both facies groups via nmr techniques and the mlr multiple linear regression approach demonstrate the applicability of these techniques to eolian sandstone moreover irreducible water saturation via the t 2 cutoff method correlates strongly with t 2lm instead of porosity finally the rock quality index and flow zone indicator were calculated based on combinable magnetic resonance cmr log interpretations this provides direct connection to properties measured in the well four flow units were classified for both facies groups results show that better reservoir quality with significant heterogeneities is observed in the cb facies this study highlights the importance integrating multiscale petrophysical properties including facies pore architecture and diagenesis analysis with core to log scale property characterization the results herein validate our reservoir characterization and flow unit classification in eolian reservoirs 2010 msc 00 01 99 00 keywords geological carbon storage eolian sandstone multiscale petrophysical characterization nuclear magnetic resonance flow unit classification 1 introduction wyoming holds more than one third of u s coal reserves at producing mines accounting for about two fifths of all coal mined in the united states in 2018 u s energy information administration 2020 coal mined in the powder river basin prb located in northeastern wyoming is mainly used at power plants large quatities of carbon dioxide co2 emissions from coal power plants contribute to the rising atmospheric co2 concentration and thus to climate change ipcc 2013 therefore substantial and sustained reduction of greenhouse gas emissions especially co2 are required if thermal coal is to remain relevant as a fuel in electricity generation geologic carbon storage gcs has been extensively explored as a feasible technology in recent years saghafi et al 2007 godec et al 2013 gong and gu 2015 jiang et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 yu et al 2021 the dry fork station dfs storage complex located in the prb was selected to evaluate the potential for co2 storage including assessment of storage capacity reservoir petrophysical properties and the sealing capacity of the cap rocks a stratigraphic well the uwprb 1 was drilled near the dry fork station and the primary studies identified the lakota formation the hulett member of the lower sundance formation and the upper minnelusa formation as potential reservoirs to satisfy co2 volumetric storage requirements of the carbon storage assurance facility enterprise carbonsafe project as one of the main storage targets the eolian minnelusa sandstone reservoirs in the prb comprise a series of stacked dunes interdunes and sand sheets resulting in drastic variations within sedimentary lithofacies in a short vertical and lateral range jorgensen and james 1988 chandler et al 1989 in addition the very fine sand deposited within the same facies such as stacked dunes also introduce heterogeneities at multiple scales starting at the sub core down to the pore cale for instance the high angle avalanche beds are separated by the typically finer grained grainfall sediments which often become permeability barriers within the sand sequence diagenesis is another important factor influencing heterogeneities which is a function of depositional environment cement precipitation and dissolution sand composition and burial history and can dramatically alter the pore structure krystinik 1990 schenk 1990 kou et al 2021 many eolian deposits with consistent mineralogy and good porosity development were intensely cemented by anhydrite and or dolomite the multi length scale heterogeneity of petrophysical properties and their spatial distribution can translate into distinct characteristics of the subsurface fluid rock system such as pore architecture porosity permeability and irreducible water saturation or a combination of these these petrophysical characteristics negatively impact co2 injectivity flow regimes migration and storage capacity thus raising significant uncertainties in gcs projects krevor et al 2011 al bayati et al 2019 liu et al 2019 chen et al 2021 han et al 2021 as the co2 injectivity flow regimes trapping mechanisms migration and storage capacity vary with rock types especially for eolian sandstones reservoir rocks classification is necessary for geological modeling and reservoir simulation for gcs padhi et al 2014 wei et al 2014 singh 2018 al bayati et al 2019 newell et al 2019 zheng et al 2021 rock typing consists of classifying distinct units of reservoir rocks by employing lithofacies petrophysical rock pore properties rock fluid interactions and or historic production injection performances gunter et al 1997 guo et al 2007 rebelle and lalanne 2014 several clustering methods can be used in reservoir characterization rebelle and lalanne 2014 1 geology driven clustering 2 porosity permeability driven clustering 3 cut off based clustering 4 capillary pressure driven clustering 5 logs driven clustering and 6 dynamic driven clustering methods currently rock typing studies more likely rely on linking two or more clustering methods salman and bellah 2009 rebelle et al 2009 skalinski and kenter 2015 chandra et al 2015 farshi et al 2019 however as opposed to oil gas reservoirs where abundant data have been collected during exploration and development stages available data for deep saline aquifers for gcs are limited the objectives of this study are 1 multiscale petrophysical properties characterization and 2 classification of flow units of the minnelusa eolian sandstones at the uwprb 1 these objectives depend on characterization and analysis tasks in this sense links between pore scale characteristics with core scale properties i e porosity permeability and the irreducible water saturation were investigated then these petrophysical properties interpreted from well log data were analyzed finally reservoir quality index rqi and flow zone indicator fzi were calculated using data interpreted from schlumberger combinable magnetic resonance cmr log and the discrete rock types drt were classified as the flow units which can be employed in the 3d geological modeling and reservoir simulation of co2 injection in the eolian units results in this study also provide a comprehensive understanding of petrophysical properties in multiscale and flow capacity of different flow units in the eolian minnelusa sandstones to provide a better reference for field operations 2 geological settings the powder river basin prb as shown in fig 1 is located in northeastern wyoming and southeastern montana the basin developed during the laramide orogenic tectonic shortening is asymmetric with the synoformal axis oriented approximately north south along the western third of the structure basin bounding features including the black hills and hartville uplift on the east laramie range and casper arch to the south bighorn mountains and the hardin platform on the west and the miles city arch bull mountains and porcupine dome on the north were shown anna 2009 the upper minnelusa formation at the dry fork station dfs storage complex located in the upper right quadrant of the state and in the region where the uwprb 1 test well was drilled consists of varying interbedded marine dolomites and eolian sandstones deposited during several cycles of transgression and regression in permo pennsylvanian time george 1984 jorgensen and james 1988 each cycle was terminated by a rapidly rising sea level that deposited carbonates and evaporites of the next cycle george 1984 the sandstone intervals of the upper minnelusa sandstones are commonly labeled alphabetically fig 1 but do not always correlate across the basin entirely at the uwprb 1 test well minnelusa b c and d sandstones are recognized near dfs the upper minnelusa sandstone intervals contain the best reservoir intervals with the highest porosity and permeability and can be productive hydrocarbon reservoirs and dispersed fields exist across much of the eastern margin of the basin anna 2009 porosity evolution of the minnelusa sandstones is largely a function of depositional environment early anhydrite cementation burial compaction and later anhydrite dissolution as well as quartz and dolomite cementation minor diagenetic alterations such as illite and pyrite growth multigenerational feldspar and dolomite dissolution and growth and modifications of early clay grain coatings do not significantly add to the evolution of porosity schenk 1990 permeability of the eolian sandstone complex is highly impacted by stratigraphic architecture and cementation which could yield a range of values several orders of magnitude between or within distinct facies such as dune interdune and or sabkha deposits the lateral and vertical stacking of eolian and sabkha deposits lead to the heterogeneity of permeability at the macroscale in addition the direction of the greatest permeability is usually perpendicular to the wind direction of dune face formation and parallel to the long axis of the dune within bedding sets at the microscale a change in grain size at the base of the dune and cementation due to capillary action and evaporation of sulphate and calcium rich fluids can create potential barriers within the dune complex which further leads to the complex permeability distributions these natural barriers are reflected in minnelusa oil fields which commonly exhibit a limited water drive being indicative of confinement from surface and other reservoirs anna 2009 however as a storage system it provides attractive qualities for potential gcs reservoir consideration the regionally extended caprock of the upper minnelusa formation is the permian opeche shale which serves as a regionally extensive confining layer moreover the lower cycles of the upper minnelusa sandstones within the study area are confined by carbonates which are most often sealing finally the dry fork station is located close to the uwprb 1 test well and provides a co2 emission source which makes the storage complex in the prb a suitable candidate for commercial carbon dioxide capture and storage 3 materials and methods 3 1 materials synthetic or surrogate brines used to saturate core plugs were prepared following the composition shown in table 1 down hole formation brine samples from the minnelusa b c and d sandstones provided the basis for the synthetic brines all brines were prepared in the laboratory by dissolving specified amounts of analytic grade salts in deionized water after mixing brines were filtered and degassed under vacuum before use rock plugs 38 1 mm in diameter of the minnelusa formation were drilled from core samples recovered from the uwprb 1 core samples were cleaned in soxhlet extractors using toluene and methanol and oven dried at 100 c for 24 h 3 2 experimental methods routine core porosity and permeability measured using nitrogen at a net confining pressure of 6 9 mpa 1000 psi were carried out using a coreval 700 porosimeter and permeameter vinci technologies france properties of each sample are summarized in table 2 samples prepared for the thin section were trimmed from the core plug ends and pore structures were determined by thin section analyses and revealed by blue dyed epoxy small rock pieces from the trimmed parts were carbon coated for sem imaging samples from the ms facies group high and low permeability and their mixtures from the cb facies group were cut adjacent to the core plugs for micp measurement the experiment was conducted at core laboratories petro services denver co using an autopore v instrument micromeritics instrument corporation distribution of pore throat radius can be obtained from the micp curves as 1 r 2 σ cos θ pc s hg where σ the interfacial tension of the mercury air is 0 48 n m pc is capillary pressure θ contact angle of mercury air commonly equals 140 s hg is the mercury saturation proton nuclear magnetic resonance 1h nmr t2 relaxation time also known as transverse relaxation time was used to estimate the pore size distribution t2 relaxation mechanisms are described in our previous publication wang et al 2018 in addition nmr t2 spectra have been frequently used for permeability estimation in both laboratory and well logging kenyon 1997 coates et al 1999 alvarado et al 2003 ren et al 2019 as pore throat size is believed to correlate strongly with pore body size for most sandstone two of the most commonly used models for permeability estimation are the semiempirical schlumberger doll research sdr and the timur coates tc or free fluid model the sdr model is based on kenyon relationship kenyon et al 1988 kenyon 1992 using measurements of sandstone permeability k porosity ϕ and the logarithm mean value of the t2 distribution t 2 lm as expressed in eq 2 coates et al 1991 developed the timur coates model based on the bound fluid porosity bfi and the free fluid porosity ffi shown in eq 3 2 k sdr c 1 ϕ 4 t 2 lm 2 3 k tc c 2 ϕ 4 ffi bfi 2 where c 1 and c 2 are empirical coefficients ϕ is fractional porosity k sdr and k tc are in md 3 3 well log data wireline logs such as gamma ray spontaneous potential sonic transit time neutron and density were collected in the uwprb 1 porosity interpreted by regressing commonly used log variables i e density log rhoz thermal neutron log nphi and sonic log dtco from uwprb 1 well against core measured values using the multi linear regression mlr approach was also studied here porosity is expressed as ϕ mlr a 1 rhoz a 2 nphi a 3 dtco a 0 where a 0 to a 3 are fitting parameters for the mlr approach the core and log data were employed as input parameters for each facies group and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator or lasso regression analysis method was employed the loss function l1 norm was used to minimize the sum of the absolute values of the model coefficients between the measured and predicted results by the linear approximation in addition the cmr log was also acquired using schlumberger s cmr plus well logging tool primary outputs include transverse relaxation time t2 distribution the logarithmic mean value of t2 total matrix independent porosity free and bound fluid porosity the output results allow permeability calculation using the sdr and tc models eliminating the need for physical samples 3 4 fluid unit classification many methods that consider petrophysical attributes are commonly used for core based hydraulic rock typing such as reservoir quality index rqi leverett 1941 winland s r35 pittman 1992 and flow zone indicator fzi amaefule et al 1993 among these methods the fzi technique has been successfully used in many studies to characterize hydraulic units amaefule et al 1993 guo et al 2007 gunter et al 1997 the technique is based on a modified kozeny carmen equation and the concept of mean hydraulic radius the reservoir quality index rqi and the normalized porosity index ϕ z were calculated based on eq 4 while the fzi was estimated by eq 5 4 ϕ z ϕ e 1 ϕ e rqi 0 0314 k ϕ e 5 fzi rqi ϕ z where k is permeability md ϕ e is the effective porosity fraction the effective porosity in this study was obtained from the free fluid porosity ffi and permeability was calculated from the sdr model the discrete rock type drt that is often employed in geological modeling and reservoir simulation was calculated using eq 6 6 drt round 2 ln fzi 10 6 4 results and discussion 4 1 depositional features and facies classification the eolian sandstones are composed of three units at uwprb 1 minnelusa b c and d fig 2 which were identified from the well logs and core descriptions the yellow fields enveloped between the neutron and density porosity curves together with the help of core description identify the sandstones in view of the limitations of core descriptions lacking extent enough to adequately describe the lithofacies subgroups of upper minnelusa reliably massive laminar bedded and cross bedded stratigraphy are utilized laminar bedded and cross bedded differences may not be discernable at a scale relevant to this investigation therefore in this study laminar and cross bedded are grouped as cross bedded facies group group 2 and the remaining massive stratigraphy is characterized as massive facies group group 1 shown in fig 2 stratigraphic features within the studied depth interval were identified with the help of a 190 ft core recovered from well uwprb 1 the minnelusa b unit lies at the top of the upper minnelusa formation in this core a 20 ft massive sandstone including hydrocarbon and transition zones was found on top of the minnelusa b sandstone min b ss but is not the focus of this study the lower part of the min b ss is mainly comprised of a mottled dolomitic massive facies facies group 2 which is 5 ft thick buff to pink fine grained to very fine grained cross bedded dolomitic sandstone are observed and portions are very faintly bedded to massive figs 3 a and b are cross bedded and laminar facies from the minnelua b sandstone which contain ripple produced strata the wind ripple facies has thin laminated millimeter scale pin stripe beds the set of inversely graded strata comprises secondary porosity after dolomite dissolution an interesting aspect of the core in fig 3a is the presence of the v marker above which is thin cross bedded millimeter scale sand sheet facies the minnelusa c unit comprises cross bedded and massive facies groups and a 6 ft thick dolostone the massive facies groups on top and in the middle of the minnelusa c unit depict gray to pink fine grained to very fine grained massive dolomitic sandstone with multiple wavy mud layers fig 3e while for the massive group on the bottom of the minnelusa c unit gray to buff fine grained to very fine grained massive dolomitic sandstone mottled with dark gray dolostone was observed the dark gray very fine grained mottling is dolomitic and made visible by diagentic alteration in addition it contains wavy dolomitic mud bands and pink carbonate layers up to 10 cm thick are present in lower portion the cross bedded facies group located in the middle of the minnelusa c unit presents gray to pink fine grained to very fine grained cross bedded dolomitic sandstone with interspersed medium grained layers fig 3d consists of stacks of flat fine laminae which might be deposited at interdune or sand sheet differentiating inter dune from sand sheet deposits based on sedimentary structure alone is hard in the minnelusa as structures are similar in these two facies in modern environment fryberger 1984 compared to units b and c the thickness of the minnelusa d sandstone is only 17 ft it presents gray fine grained to very fine grained dolomitic sandstone the massive facies group is located on the upper portion with a thin dolostone layer base while the lower portion is cross bedded facies group shown in fig 2 figs 3g and h show examples of the upper massive and the lower cross bedded facies groups the cross bedded facies group of the d unit mainly comprises sand sheet produced strata carbonate cycles including a b c and d dolomites at uw prb 1 examples are shown in figs 3c and i deposited as the water table began to rise in low areas between the dunes during the regression time the minnelusa a dolomite overlies on the top of the minnelusa b sand and is very thin minnelusa b dolomite has gray micritic and vuggy moldic dolostone with interspersed anhydrite portions of the dolostone are recrystallized and the extent of fracturing varies throughout the member moreover stylolites and mud layers up to 1 cm in thickness are present similar to the b dolomite the minnelusa c dolomite also shows gray to pink micritic to vuggy moldic dolostone the top portions of the c dolomite and most of the minnelusa d dolomite were highly fractured micritic dolostone shown in figs 3f and h even though the c and d dolomites were fractured the large salinity differences shown in table 1 indicate that they are sealed at the well site 4 2 pore structure characterization 4 2 1 sem and thin section analysis sem analysis of rock samples from the minnelusa reservoir intervals was utilized to unveil pore architecture and understand mineral constituents as they occur in pore and pore throat volumes from different facies the samples from core plugs mh6 and mh13 shown in figs 4a and b were used for this comparison fig 4a from the minnelusa c sand is variably laminar and massive bedded from dune face and interdune input showing a variety of grain size distributions average size from 30 μ m to 400 μ m resulting in pore size variability both microcrystalline dolomite and anhydrite occur as cements with lenticular nodules being associated with bedding strata fig 4b shows an sem image of core sample mh13 which is distinctive of massive bedded interdune material of relatively homogeneous grain size resulting in similar pore size it exhibits prevalent microcrystalline dolomite cementation which is the primary mineral after quartz in this sample cement often occurs as nodules with intergranular texture and associated carbonate bound secondary pore networks throughout the sample and is apparently not associated with bedding like sample mh6 thin section analysis was used to describe the stratigraphic type pore structure and mineralogy of minnelusa sands collected from uwprb 1 from thin section scale analysis three primary stratigraphy types emerged these are massive bedded with variable sorting laminar bedded with moderate sorting and variable cementation and cross bedded moderately sorted with variable cementation laminar bedded samples may be cross bedded or horizontally deposited interdune material depending on location in the dune field deposition environment figs 4c f show examples of the four thin sections derived strata descriptions and the sample identification are as follows sample mh6 cross bedded fig 4 c moderately to poorly sorted sub rounded to rounded quartz dominated with average grain size ranging from 30 to 400 μ m this sample exhibits both matrix and grain supported areas though grain supported matrix is dominant microcrystalline dolomite cement and anhydrite cement are prevalent and are the primary mineral after quartz in this sample often occurring in nodules anhydrite tends to occur in lenticular nodules associated with bedding the largest primary grains tend to be rounded to well rounded with finer grain materials being more angular in character potassium feldspar occurring 5 10 of the mineralogy is present mostly as a secondary mineral though relic grains do exist opaque minerals occur within the majority of microcrystalline dolomite cements which occupy most pore space edges though not all pores are cemented dolomite cements where no associated with nodules tend to be grain surface coatings with open pore space remaining between most quartz grains sample mh7 laminar bedded fig 4 e laminar bedded moderately to poorly sorted sub rounded to rounded quartz dominated bedding is defined by depositional grain packing rather than grain size primary grains range from 40 to 420 μ m though other intervals of this facies have grain sizes ranging from 40 to 300 μ m this sample exhibits both matrix and grain supported areas though grain supported matrix is dominant microcrystalline dolomite cement is the most abundant mineral after quartz in this sample often occurring in clusters and grain coatings anhydrite tends to occur in lenticular nodules associated with bedding the largest primary quartz grains tend to be rounded to well rounded with finer grain materials being more angular in character potassium feldspar occurring 5 10 of the mineralogy is dominantly as a secondary mineral though relic grains do exist opaque minerals occur within the majority of microcrystalline dolomite cements which occupy most pore space edges though not all pores are cemented sample mh13 massive bedded fig 4 d is a well sorted sub rounded to rounded grain supported quartz sandstone primary grains with average size range from 50 to 140 μ m with rare larger grains occurring up to 220 μ m in diameter micro crystalline dolomite cement is prevalent and is the primary mineral after quartz in this sample often occurring as nodules with intergranular texture and associated secondary pore networks and as grain coatings distributed throughout the pore network potassium feldspar occurring less than 5 of the mineralogy is dominantly as a secondary mineral occurring as grain coatings along pore boundaries though relic grains do exist opaque minerals occur within the majority of microcrystalline dolomite cements which occupy most pore space edges minor anhydrite cement is present in a few pores sample mh17 massive bedded fig 4 f is a moderately well sorted sub angular to sub rounded grain supported quartz with average size ranging from 50 to 160 μ m apparent porosity is very good compared to sample mh13 microcrystalline dolomite cement is present in small amounts occurring as nodules with intergranular texture with associated secondary pore networks and as single grains adhered to quartz grain boundaries potassium feldspar makes up approximately 3 to 5 of the mineralogy and is dominantly as a secondary mineral occurring as grain coatings along pore boundaries though relic grains do exist opaque minerals make up less than 1 of the rock and most often occur with potassium feldspar the above descriptions indicate that the differences between laminar and cross bedded lithologies from thin section descriptions are too small to be considered different grain sorting grain size variability with exception of a few larger grains cementation occurrence and secondary mineral occurrence are all similar in contrast the difference between bedded laminar and or cross bedded and massive minnelusa facies is obvious from thin section images sorting of massive bedded intervals is better than that of laminar and cross bedded the overall grain size is smaller within massive bedded intervals as well as being less variable in range and secondary depositional minerals such as potassium feldspar are less prevalent 4 2 2 nmr t2 distribution t2 distribution of selected samples that represent cb and ms facies groups are shown in fig 5 the nmr t2 spectra of cross bedded plugs shown in fig 5a show the triple and quadrimodal distributions for the mh6 and mh7 samples respectively t2 values of the rightmost peak t 2 rmp that corresponds to the dominant pore spaces are 204 and 508 ms respectively the micropores which are usually poorly connected correspond to the short relaxation time components the complexity of the bedding structures in the eolian deposition resulted from heterogeneities from pore to sub core scales first grain sizes of the dune sandstone are larger in comparison to those in the ripple sand sheet leading to larger pore sizes further mechanical compaction and pressure solution could further result in smaller t2 for micro meso and macropores second with respect to the pore scale heterogeneity an important influencing factor at sub core scale is dolomite cement cement content at the high permeability layers is much smaller than that of the lower permeability layers the larger peaks are contributed by the pore spaces from the higher permeability layers while the middle peak correspond to the pore spaces mainly from the lower permeability layers consequently compared to mh7 the smaller grain size and larger dolomite content contribute to the disappearance of the rightmost peak observed in sample mh6 the nmr t2 spectra of massive plugs show the triple modal distributions shown in fig 5b the disordered packing in massive sandstone with minor changes in the ordering of the individual grains results in wider range of pore types in comparison with those in the cross bedded samples furthermore pink to gray dolomitic cement together with finer carbonate stringers leads to the smaller pore type which corresponds to the leftmost peak in the t2 distribution in comparison with the sample mh17 sample mh11 has the very fine grains and higher microcrystalline dolomite cement which result in the triple modal distribution and smaller t2 in addition the number of the pores corresponding to the middle peak is larger than that of the rightmost peak the pore filling dolomite cement reduces the size of the larger pores directly increasing the population of the micropores 4 2 3 micp pore throat size distributions ptsd shown in fig 6 were derived from micp curves using eq 1 pores are assumed cylindrical the ptsd of the massive sample is uni modal with the peak at 8 1 μ m even though the size of the dominant pore spaces is uniform the wide distribution indicates the existence of smaller pores in contrast the high and low permeability layers of the cross bedded sample show a bi modal characteristic while the mixture shows a triple modal characteristic indicating the complexity of their pore structures it is interesting to notice that for both massive and mixture samples the number of the peaks from ptsd is different from that of t2 distributions the different characteristics have been reported in previous studies and can be attributed to several causes wang et al 2018 wu et al 2019 first due to the heterogeneity the amount of rock pieces used in the micp experiment cannot fully represent core plug used for t2 measurement secondly based on eq 1 micp measures the pore throat size i e pore entry radii and cannot fully represent the size of the pore body while nmr t2 estimates both the pore body and throat sizes 4 3 petrophysical properties characterization 4 3 1 laboratory porosity and permeability cross plots of nitrogen porosity and permeability are shown in fig 7 the massive and cross bedded facies groups have average porosity and permeability of 0 067 and 3 724 md and 0 085 and 16 5 md respectively the coefficients of determination r 2 of the exponential relations are 0 94 and 0 76 for the massive and cross bedded facies groups respectively moreover fig 7 shows that porosity and permeability of the cb facies group have a large overlap with that of the ms facies group and the former group possesses higher porosity and permeability this is because petrophysical characteristics of the eolian sandstones are a function of dynamic depositional environment lithofacies variations and digenetic processes in the well uwprb 1 an excellent zone with high porosity and permeability occurs at the top of the minnelusa b sandstone which is largely composed of massive sandstone such as the reworking of the avalanche dune front in contrast for massive sandstone deposited at tubular conditions cements like mottled or banding dolomitic carbonate and carbonate mud stringers result in the low porosity and permeability for the cross bedded facies group higher porosity and permeability for grainflow or avalanche deposits but low angle and planar interdune deposits i e wadi ripple and grainfall deposits have low porosity and permeability because of cementation or very fine to fine grain packing for example the ripple sandstones were well cemented soon after deposition in addition digenetic processes such as cementation pressure solution mineral dissolution and authigenic mineral nucleation can influence the quality of the rocks for both facies groups which is clearly shown from the sem and thin section images in fig 4 the sem image shown in fig 4b illustrates the relationship between authigenic rhombohedral dolomite grains and larger detrital grains as well as the in fill of primary porosity by cements figs 4d and e indicate that cementation is among the most important porosity reducing diagenetic process these pore scale reducing effect not only directly reduces porosity but also permeability in addition to the laboratory measurements permeability was also estimated from the nmr relaxation data using the sdr and tc models listed in table 2 the laboratory and estimated permeability correlate well fig 8 coefficients c 1 and c 2 are 5 40 8 79 and 1 60e 5 8 94e 4 for the ms cb facies groups to evaluate the accuracy of permeability estimated from the nmr relaxation data the pearson correlation coefficients r between the laboratory and nmr approach for the ms and the cb facies groups were calculated which are 0 93 0 95 for the sdr model and 0 93 0 79 for the tc model respectively the good correlations indicate the advantage of permeability estimation using the nmr techniques 4 3 2 porosity and permeability from well log interpretation porosity along the wellbore was obtained directly from the cmr log based on the coefficients c 1 and c 2 obtained from the previous section permeability was estimated through the sdr and tc models in addition porosity was interpreted by the mlr approach the fitting parameters a 0 to a 3 for the cross bedded and massive groups for the mlr approach are 1 08 0 34 0 19 0 0049 and 2 20 0 73 2257 00 0 0041 respectively then permeability was calculated based on the relationships with porosity shown in fig 7 fig 9 shows porosity and permeability results from laboratory measurement cmr log and mlr approaches porosity and permeability interpreted from cmr log show that high porosity and permeability zones are found in the minnelusa b sandstone and the cross bedded facies zones of the minnelusa c sandstone while for the massive facies zones in the minnelusa c sandstone the formation quality is low in addition the variation in vertical direction suggests that the c sandstone is more heterogeneous even though the minnelusa d sandstone is thin 17 ft the relatively high porosity and permeability values could make it a storage zone it is worth noticing the values of porosity and permeability obtained from the mlr approach at the top of minnelusa b sandstone are lower than those estimated by the other two methods well log based this is the result of extrapolation without proper laboratory measurement constraints missing at the top of the interval this illustrates the disadvantage of mlr approach which depends on the laboratory measurements and their coverage along the well log depth 4 3 3 irreducible water saturation in contrast to oil gas reservoirs co2 injectivity storage capacity and migration are three key factors for commercial gcs projects that means not only high enough porosity and permeability but a lower irreducible water saturation is desirable irreducible water s wir is defined as the fraction of water that remains trapped after displacement with a nonwetting phase morrow 1970 in general higher clay bound water is a direct consequence of higher clay volume fraction and a higher capillary bound water saturation indicates complex pore geometry and networks which results from cementation nmr t2 spectrum directly reflects the pore size distribution in fully saturated rock herein an empirical t2 cut off value of 33 ms was used to split the t2 spectrum into bound water 33 ms and free water 33 ms fig 10 shows s wir histograms calculated from cmr t2 spectra of the two facies groups the irreducible water saturation varies from 0 0 to 0 8 with an average of 0 27 and 0 15 for the ms and cb facies groups respectively in this study larger content of the dolomite cements which might produce tight porosity similar to that related to clays for the massive facies group might result in larger irreducible water saturation in addition the by pass effect due to high seepage resistance high capillary pressure dominates locally as the heterogeneity of pore structures mainly exits at the pore level while at the core scale the irreducible water saturation might be homogeneously distributed for the massive facies group in contrast for the cross bedded facies group the by pass effect is pronounced at the core level because of the lower permeability zones from where the bound water volume mainly comes while for the higher permeability zones which possess the most pore spaces the irreducible water saturation is mainly controlled by the pore level by pass effect to further investigate the dominant influencing factors on s wir the relationships between s wir with ϕ cmr and t 2lm are depicted in fig 11 fig 11a shows that the irreducible water saturation decreases with the increase of porosity however the negative correlation is weak for both facies groups indicating that porosity has less impact on s wir for both facies groups s wir is also inversely proportional to t 2 lm as shown in fig 11b the relative good trends denoted by the values of r 2 which are weakly correlated to porosity indicate that the irreducible water saturation is mainly related to the rock type different correlations for different types and consequently controlled by pore structure 4 4 flow unit classification fig 12 shows that the high quality intervals are mainly located in the cross bedded facies group of the minnelusa b c and d sands indicating that the main co2 flow zones would occur in these intervals for the massive facies group the overall poor quality would result in lower co2 injectivity and storage capacity four drt units 11 12 13 and 14 were subdivided shown in fig 12 the flow units 13 and 14 exhibit good reservoir quality with favorable porosity and permeability and smaller irreducible water saturation fig 13 in contrast flow units 11 and 12 are not favorable to co2 flow capacity due to lower porosity and permeability and larger irreducible water saturation fig 13 depicts the thickness of different flow units for both groups and the cross plots of their corresponding porosity and permeability respectively the total thickness of the flow units 13 and 14 for the cross bedded facies group is 87 ft with 50 ft of good quality flow unit 14 for the massive facies group the total thickness of the flow units 13 and 14 is 69 ft with only 30 ft for flow unit 4 and the thickness of flow unit 2 is up to 46 ft in addition to the quality of the flow units their continuity and variation along the well depth also play an important role in the co2 injectivity and its profile examination of the flow units in minnelusa b and d sandstones shows that these units are less variable implying that the co2 injectivity profile is more homogeneous flow units in the c sandstone vary within a short distance which should lead to more heterogeneous co2 injectivity profile even though the tight zones can act as barriers to hinder the migration of co2 in the vertical direction they would also cause co2 fingering through high permeability zones which would lead to a lower sweep efficiency thus the co2 storage capacity would be reduced and the co2 plume size would be enlarged 5 conclusions and implications for gcs in eolian reservoirs in this paper the multiscale petrophysical characterization was performed for the minnelusa b c and d sandstones to evaluate geological carbon storage while geological compelxity is inherent to these eolian systems the research results in this work led to the classification of the two main facies groups massive and cross bedded through identification of depositional features for the massive facies group the interdune strata show massive grain packing and the reservoir quality is mainly controlled by diagenetic effects the cross bedded facies group is characterized as pore to core scale cross or laminar bedded sandstones depositional environments and dolomite cement content are the two dominant influencing factors on reservoir qualities furthermore laboratory t2 distributions and micp show the complex pore structure for the cb facies group while for the ms facies pore throat size are broader and more uniform routine porosity and permeability measurements of both facies groups show good relationships permeability estimated by the sdr and the tc models using laboratory t2 distribution and cmr logging data and porosity obtained from the cmr log show good correlation with experimental measurements indicating the advantage of the nmr techniques in petrophysical characterization of eolian reservoirs compared to conventional well logs by employing the classified facies groups and effective porosity and permeability interpreted from cmr log four discrete rock types were determined for the two facies groups moreover the value of the classification method can be additionally appreciated by trends of irreducible water saturation that strongly correlate to the classified rock groups this is an indication of the internal consistency of our classification method the thicknesses of the flow units 13 and 14 for the cross bedded facies groups are larger than that of the massive designating it as the high potential co2 injection zones the results can be used as the primary data to predict the flow unit variation across the area of interest and as the input data for 3d geological modeling and co2 injection simulation the findings in this study have broader implications for not only geological carbon storage but also co2 enhanced oil recovery in eolian reservoirs furthermore results will also help to understand pore to log scale reservoir characteristics models involving grain parameters may not be adequate to appropriately predict permeability within an eolian reservoir because higher and lower permeability eolian facies do not always have resolvable porosity differences the appropriate flow units partitioning of eolian reservoirs should be performed based on the geological facies characterization and classification even though co2 injectivity for the good units of cb facies group is more suitable for gcs than the ms facies group in view of the reservoir quality and thickness co2 storage capacity and migration in the cb facies group is worse due to the multi scale heterogeneities and lower volumetric sweep efficiency kou et al 2021 in addition as less data are available in the study area the lateral continuity also increases the uncertainty of the commercialization of the gcs further exploration including drilling a new test well conducting a 3d seismic survey performing cross well interference test are proposed in phase iii of the project

3539,at different time scales the potential factors influencing changes in sediment transport vary because the processes of each impact factor overlaps on different time scales it is challenging to evaluate the complex multi scale relationships between monthly sediment load and its potential impact factors the objective of this study was to investigate the scale specific main factors influencing monthly sediment loads using the multivariate empirical mode decomposition memd method monthly sediment loads and five potential influencing factors runoff precipitation air temperature potential evapotranspiration and enhanced vegetation index during 2003 2017 were collected in the wujiang karst watershed of southwest china the memd method was used to decompose the temporal series of monthly sediment load into seven intrinsic mode functions imf and residuals using a hilbert transform the sum of variance contribution rates of imf1 3 2 months imf2 5 5 months and imf3 12 1 months was more than 90 although temperature and potential evapotranspiration significantly affect monthly sediment loads at the observation scale no significant relationships were observed between them at some specific scales after memd the accuracy of the prediction model after memd was better than that of the prediction model using original data runoff and precipitation were important predictors in the prediction model this study shows the advantages of the memd method for analyzing non stationary and nonlinear hydrological processes and this useful tool is recommended for application in other karst watersheds keywords soil erosion multivariate empirical mode decomposition multiscale analysis ecohydrology karst landform 1 introduction soil erosion is a major threat to soil degradation worldwide syvitski et al 2005 borrelli et al 2017 specifically soil erosion affects soil nutrients and soil carbon cycling resulting in the loss of soil nitrogen phosphorus and organic carbon which has a negative impact on agricultural production and the environment borrelli et al 2020 wuepper et al 2020 in addition soil erosion leads to environmental deterioration land productivity declines resulting in frequent floods sandstorms and other problems borrelli et al 2020 globally 75 billion tons of arable land are reported to be eroding every year equivalent to 400 billion in annual losses borrelli et al 2017 soil erosion is becoming more and more serious and has become a worrying global environmental problem wang et al 2016 soil erosion and re deposition of sediments have reshaped the earth s surface and affected the functioning of ecosystems and social structures wuepper et al 2020 sediment transport caused by soil erosion is one of the main components of global environmental change wang et al 2016 therefore it is of paramount importance to understand the factors influencing sediment transport to develop effective watershed management and sustainable agricultural production sediment erosion generally includes a variety of processes including raindrop splashing soil particle separation runoff erosion and transportation therefore variations in river sediment transport are affected by a variety of driving factors including runoff precipitation air temperature potential evapotranspiration and vegetation coverage li et al 2020a casserly et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 runoff plays a key role in the dynamics of sediment transport in ecosystem basins and it is also a controlling factor affecting the contribution of maximum sediment transport fortesa et al 2020 precipitation is one of the main factors affecting soil erosion at watershed scale especially for the extreme precipitation events which can generate a huge soil loss wan et al 2014 li et al 2020a tian et al 2017 wei et al 2021 air temperature has a great influence on runoff thereby impacting sediment transport tian et al 2019 change in potential evapotranspiration is closely related to the vegetation coverage and air temperature which alters the sediment load tuset et al 2016 li et al 2020a precipitation is the main kinetic energy causing soil erosion and runoff and on the contrary vegetation can reduce the generation of such kinetic energy vegetation can reduce raindrop energy delay runoff generation time root systems can consolidate soil and the humus produced can improve soil texture thus enhancing resistance to soil erosion wei et al 2007 duan et al 2016 wang and sun 2020 in general the relationship between sediment load and its potential influencing factors varies greatly on different time scales e g annual flood season monthly and daily scales gao et al 2016 one factor may have a strong influence at a particular scale but the same factor may exhibit a minor influence on another scale therefore it is necessary to evaluate the relationships between sediment load and various influencing factors at a specific scales many methods have been used to investigate the multi scale relationships between sediment loads and its potential influencing factors include wavelet analysis gao et al 2014 liu et al 2017 li et al 2018 and linear spectral analysis restrepo and kjerfve 2000 venditti and bennett 2000 rossi et al 2009 gebreslassie et al 2020 however these methods are based on the superposition principle and assume sediment production is a linear process hydrological changes are influenced by many factors the influence expressed by different frequency components in the process is not additive so it does not follow the superposition principle she et al 2013 although wavelet analysis can identify the characteristics of signals in the time and frequency domains zhu et al 2018 the number of wavelet bases and decomposition layers needs to be set artificially and lacks self adaptability bai et al 2015 alternatively multiple empirical mode decomposition memd is an extension of empirical mode decomposition emd and has the characteristics of complete adaptability memd can also divide sediment loads and potential influencing factors into different intrinsic mode functions imfs and residues at the same scale effectively solving the problems of stationarity and linear assumptions therefore memd is well suited to handle nonlinear and non stationary hydrological processes hu and si 2013 li et al 2020a many previous studies have applied memd in soil properties hu and si 2013 she et al 2016 ma et al 2017 she et al 2017 yang et al 2019 and there have been a few studies on annual sediment load li et al 2020a generally runoff precipitation temperature potential evapotranspiration and vegetation coverage all exhibit significant seasonal or monthly variation which may lead to seasonal variations in sediment load nevertheless most of the previous studies are concerned with annual data series which may mask seasonal variations of sediment load furthermore the distinct hydrogeology heterogeneous landscapes rugged geomorphology rich biodiversity and fragile ecosystems may enhance the temporal variability of monthly sediment loads in karst landscapes few studies however have attempted to quantify the multiscale relationships between monthly sediment loads and their potential influencing factors especially in karst watersheds where an ecologically vulnerable area experiencing severe soil erosion karst landscapes account for 7 to 12 of global land area and provide water for nearly a quarter of the global population gutiérrez et al 2014 hartmann et al 2015 southwest china has one of the largest humid karst landforms from tropical or subtropical regions in the world qin et al 2020 tong et al 2020 in karst region of southwest china soil erosion directly affects 1 7 million people hinders local economic development and is the main ecological disaster jiang et al 2014 karst areas are characterized by low rates of soil formation and high permeability and are one of the most ecologically fragile geomorphological areas jiang et al 2014 wang et al 2019b increasing population and inappropriate land uses have accelerated ecological environment problems such as rocky desertification and soil erosion in karst areas yan and cai 2015 li et al 2017 furthermore due to the subtropical humid monsoon climate in southwest china heavy precipitation may also lead to a large amount of soil erosion li et al 2016 wang et al 2019a additionally the special hydrogeology heterogeneous landscapes and rugged geomorphology made the soil erosion more complicated in karst areas than non karst areas jiang et al 2014 li et al 2020c however the time scale relationships between monthly sediment load and runoff vegetation and other influencing factors were still unclear consequently this study provides an opportunity to test the applicability of the memd method for exploring the scale specific factors influencing monthly sediment load in karst watersheds the objectives of this study were 1 to identify the temporal variation in monthly sediment loads and related factors during 2003 to 2017 in a typical karst area of wujiang watershed 2 to investigate the multiscale relationships between monthly sediment loads and their potential controlling factors using the memd method and 3 to further estimate the monthly sediment loads at the observation scale based on the scale specific control factors 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area as the largest river in guizhou province the wujiang river originates at xianglushan huayu cave in weining county in the western part of guizhou province flows through northern guizhou and southeastern chongqing and ultimately joins the yangtze river in fuling district of chongqing the wujiang river is an important tributary of the upper reaches of the yangtze river and a major water supply river for the three gorges project the main stream of the wujiang river has a total length of 1 037 km and a basin area of 87 900 square kilometers it has two sources the southern source is the three chahe river which originates in weining county in western guizhou and the northern source is the six chong river and originates in the yunnan guizhou junction hezhang county the north and south sources converged in the huawu base and represent the upper reaches of the wujiang river the part of the river that runs from huawu to sinan is the middle reach the wujiang river while below the sinan is the lower reach the wujiang river watershed 22 07 30 22 n 104 18 109 22 e is located in the transition slope zone from the yunnan guizhou plateau to the hills of western hunan with high terrain in the southwest and low terrain in the northeast fig 1 six other karst watersheds xijiang hongshui liujiang nanpan xunjiang and yujiang were also selected in our previous study li et al 2016 to better elaborate the temporal variation in monthly sediment load only wujiang watershed was selected in current study the land use landform climate runoff and sediment load of wujiang watershed is typical among these seven watersheds in wujiang watershed land use types are mainly cultivated land woodland and grassland with little developed area the karst landform is relatively developed and there are large differences in elevation over the terrain which creates distinct vertical changes throughout the area the wujiang river watershed basically has a subtropical monsoon climate characterized by distinct seasonal changes with a hot summer and warm winter strong monsoons and uneven distribution of precipitation throughout the year including dry season and rainy season the flood season is from may to september which accounts for about 72 of the annual precipitation different regions in the wujiang river watershed are characterized by differences in geomorphic features vegetation types and soil characteristics which contribute to great differences in the sediment loads of different regions among them as the largest tributary of the wujiang river the liucong river watershed has low vegetation coverage high sediment concentration and high soil and water losses which all contribute high sediment loads to the wujiang river 2 2 data monthly runoff and sediment load

level and there is an increasing or decreasing trend when the z is greater than 2 576 this demonstrated the α is at the 0 01 level and there is a strong increasing or decreasing trend 2 3 2 multivariate empirical mode decomposition memd memd can decompose complex signals into finite intrinsic mode functions and residuals and then stabilize the non stationary data and obtain the frequencies with physical significance by using a hilbert transform zhu et al 2018 memd can decompose the signal according to its own time scale which has obvious advantages in processing non stationary and nonlinear data yang et al 2019 assume that the n dimensional vector data representing the sediment load and its influencing factors v s v 1 s v 2 s v 3 s is a function of the data s x θ

items rehman and mandic 2010 to test the applicability of the memd method in quantifying the multiscale relationships between monthly sediment loads and their controlling factors this method was also applied in other karst watersheds i e xijiang hongshui liujiang nanpan xunjiang and yujiang the detailed information of these six karst watersheds can be found in our previous study li et al 2016 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of monthly sediment load and related factors at observation scale descriptive statistical parameters of monthly sediment loads and the potential influencing factors in the wujiang watershed are shown in table 1 the highest monthly sediment loads of the wujiang watershed were 607 4 104 t and the mean value was 39 0 104 t with a 220 coefficient of variation the monthly sediment loads exhibited strong variability cv 100 nielsen and bouma 1985 for the runoff precipitation temperature potential evapotranspiration and evi the coefficient of variation values ranged from 40 to 70 indicating moderate variability 10 cv 100 nielsen and bouma 1985 generally sediment load is affected by many factors and has great variation specifically the sediment load is affected by temperature precipitation runoff geology and geomorphology and human activities and so the sediment load exhibits stronger variability than its influencing factors which is consistent with some previous studies knapen et al 2007 li et al 2016 li et al 2017 fig 2 shows the temporal variation in monthly sediment loads and the five influencing factors on the observed scale from 2003 to 2017 annual sediment loads in 2003 1432 104 t 2004 1080 104 t and 2007 1040 104 t were all greater than in other years there were large differences between monthly sediment loads fig 2 3 with the exception of may sediment load in june and july were significantly higher than those in other months p 0 05 fig 3 similarly the runoff in june and july were also significantly greater than those in other months p 0 05 fig 3 significant values for precipitation temperature potential evapotranspiration and evi were observed in june july august july august and june august respectively p 0 05 fig 3 it is important to note that the sediment load from may to july accounts for about 40 90 of the annual sediment load this indicated that the annual sediment load was dominated by a few months the sediment load of a single extreme precipitation event can exceed the average sediment load for many years estrany et al 2010 li et al 2020b may to july or even the extreme erosive events are probably the primary periods controlling sediment transport identifying the monthly or extreme erosion events will help provide important information about how to effectively facilitate soil erosion control measures table 2 shows the results of m k trend analysis of sediment transport in the wujiang watershed for 12 months during 2003 2017 sediment load in any month from january to december all showed a decreasing trend while a significant decreasing trend was only observed in march to may and october to december the decrease of sediment transport from 2003 to 2017 may be largely due to the influence of human activities such as the dam construction and soil conservation measures wu et al 2020 the grain for green project was initialized in 1999 in the wujiang watershed and the conversion of farmland to forest and grassland was fully implemented which greatly reduced soil erosion ye et al 2020 furthermore extensive construction of cascade hydropower reservoirs especially upstream of the wujiang river were also responsible for the sharp decrease in sediment loads wang et al 2019a ye et al 2020 therefore soil and water conservation measures and cascade hydropower reservoirs construction had a profound impact on river sediment transport and made important contributions to the reduction of sediment transport li et al 2020d wu et al 2020 before the memd analysis the relationships between sediment loads and the potential influencing factors were evaluated fig 4 runoff precipitation temperature potential evapotranspiration and evi all had a significant impact on monthly sediment loads p 0 05 fig 4 previous studies have indicated that no significant relationships were found between annual sediment yield and temperature in six karst watersheds in southwest china li et al 2020a this implies that the factors influencing the sediment loads are different between the monthly and annual temporal scale consequently a better understanding of the factors influencing monthly sediment load is essential to reasonably manage river flows 3 2 multiscale relationships between monthly sediment load and related factors the multiple data sets of monthly sediment load and its five influencing factors were decomposed into seven imfs and residues using the memd method fig 5 an imf with the same numerical value has different oscillation frequency and width among the sediment load and its five influencing factors similar to the emd method imfs with large numerical values correspond to a large time scale but a small oscillation frequency while imfs with small numerical values have a large oscillation frequency on a small time scale hu and si 2013 yang et al 2019 li et al 2020a for example the fluctuation amplitude of monthly sediment loads and runoff in imf1 and imf2 were large which indicates that the temporal variability of sediment load and runoff was large the residue sequence shows the transformation trend of the original data she et al 2016 ma et al 2017 the temporal patterns of residue sequence for sediment loads is similar to evi showing a decreasing trend while the other four factors showed an increasing trend table 3 shows the imf values for sediment load and its five influencing factors obtained by a hilbert conversion the scales of monthly sediment load and its potential influencing factors corresponding to a specific imf were averaged to indicate the scale of that imf for all the variables the mean values of the specific scales of imf1 imf2 imf3 imf4 imf5 imf6 and imf7 were 3 5 5 5 12 1 17 3 25 7 58 1 and 76 3 months respectively the specific scale of almost all variables increased with the increase in the imf value except for temperature the scale of temperature at imf6 is 70 months which is twice the size of temperature at imf7 similar results were also reported by yang et al 2019 and li et al 2020a with the increase of the imf value the difference of the specific scale among the seven imfs also gradually expands especially in the largest scale this is because only a finite period of oscillation is included within a limited observational scale rehman and mandic 2010 liu et al 2016 table 3 also shows that the specific scale of different factors were similar at small time scales while significant difference was observed at the long time scales this implied that there was no accurate common scale among all factors at the long time scales which is similar to the results of previous studies she et al 2017 yang et al 2019 table 4 shows the extent to which all imf contribute to the original variances the variance contribution rates of sediment loads and the five related factors are mainly distributed in imf1 imf2 and imf3 the sum of variance contribution rates of imf1 to imf3 for sediment loads and the five factors were all greater than 90 this indicates that the fluctuation of short time scales of 3 2 imf1 5 5 imf2 and 12 1 months imf3 are dominant especially for the imf3 time scale about one year the variance contribution rate of runoff precipitation air temperature potential evapotranspiration and evi were all greater than 59 while this value for monthly sediment load were only 44 the contribution rate of residue variance in the current study was relatively low compared with the values reported by she et al 2017 and li et al 2020a this difference may be attributed to the larger scale variation of the residue and a short capture scale in the current study rehman and mandic 2010 hu and si 2013 it is worth noting that the sum of variance contribution rates of all imfs and residuals is not equal to 100 table 4 this may be due to the lack of complete orthogonality among imfs and the related processes occurring at each specific scale are not independent of each other hu and si 2013 she et al 2016 she et al 2017 huang et al 2003 pointed out that this orthogonality is not necessary when memd is used to extend nonlinear and non stationary time series and this was verified using a detailed calculation process actually the linear decomposition system is required orthogonality rehman and mandic 2010 lack of orthogonality is a great advantage for the nonlinear decomposition systems such as memd hu and si 2013 yang et al 2019 li et al 2020a therefore the memd method was suitable to analyze the non stationary nonlinear data set in current study fig 6 shows the correlation between monthly sediment loads and the five related factors among all the imfs and residuals at the observation scale the five related factors are all significantly positively correlated with sediment load p 0 05 fig 4 after memd there is a significantly negative correlation or no significant correlation between sediment loads and the relevant factors at some specific scales fig 6 for example the potential evapotranspiration was significantly positive with monthly sediment load at imf3 imf4 and imf5 while significantly negative relationship was observed between precipitation and monthly sediment load at imf6 fig 6 the positive correlation at one scale could reduce or cancel negative correlation at another scale resulting low overall correlation hu et al 2014 generally air temperature and potential evapotranspiration was significantly correlated with monthly sediment load on a long time scale which is similar to the result of li et al 2020a air temperature and potential evapotranspiration indirectly affects sediment load by affecting plant growth and community composition which may explain why air temperature and potential evapotranspiration has an impact on sediment loads on a long time scale but not on a short time li et al 2017 runoff and precipitation are significantly correlated with sediment loads in all imf which is related to the direct involvement of runoff and precipitation in soil erosion and its influence on river sediment loads zhang et al 2020 precipitation and runoff play key roles in the changes of sediment loads and are generally the main factors that influence monthly sediment loads wang et al 2016 li et al 2017 fortesa et al 2020 similarly evi has a significant effect on monthly sediment load at all imfs fig 6 it is important to note that the evi is significantly positive with monthly sediment load at small time scales such as imf1 and imf2 fig 6 generally the vegetation can greatly reduce soil erosion by intercepting rainfall decreasing raindrop impact energy enhancing infiltration and improving soil structure knapen et al 2007 duan et al 2016 borrelli et al 2017 however at the month scale the great erosion events mainly happened during june to september when the vegetation had the maximum coverage as a result high evi generally corresponds to great sediment load and thus positive relationship is observed between evi and sediment load at monthly scale as expected evi is significantly negative with sediment load at large time scales such as imf4 and imf6 fig 6 therefore the overall correlation between evi and sediment load was relatively low since positive correlation at small time scale would cancel negative correlation at long time scale 3 3 monthly sediment load estimation based on its scale specific controlling factors stepwise multiple linear regression was used to predict the monthly sediment loads of all imf and residuals from the same imf scale specific control factor table 5 all the prediction models of monthly sediment loads and the related factors have large r 2 which indicates that their predictions at these scales are relatively accurate for monthly sediment load the adjusted r 2 of imf2 0 723 imf3 0 725 and imf4 0 854 were all higher than for imf1 0 576 and imf5 0 656 this result implies that not all the long time scale prediction models are better than short time scales the r 2 of imf7 and residue is close to 1 indicating that almost all the variance of sediment loads can be explained by the linear correlation between sediment loads and the relevant factors the small r 2 of imf1 may be due to the influence of other factors that were not investigated in this study similar results were also observed in xijiang hongshui liujiang nanpan xunjiang and yujiang karst watersheds table s1 of the supplementary information in table 5 runoff and evi were included in almost all equations while precipitation only appeared in imf3 and imf6 and temperature was only found in large scale imf6 imf7 and residuals this further corroborates that there is a close relationship between monthly runoff and sediment loads while the temperature greatly affects monthly sediment loads at a long time scale the relative importance of explanatory factors can be expressed by the absolute value of standardized regression coefficients which varies with time scale she et al 2013 li et al 2020a for example evi was the most important explanatory variable for the four time scales captured by imf1 imf4 imf6 and imf7 on the imf3 time scale runoff was the most important explanatory variable as can be seen from table 5 evi is the most important factor relative to other factors as long as evi was involved in the equation as an explanatory variable this implies that vegetation restoration is an important component for controlling runoff and sediment loads in the wujiang watershed fig 7 exhibits the r 2 between the predicted monthly sediment loads at all scales by each variable and the monthly sediment loads at the observed scale runoff is the main factor affecting sediment loads in the wujiang watershed and precipitation and evi had slightly less effect on sediment transport than runoff in xijiang hongshui liujiang nanpan xunjiang and yujiang karst watersheds runoff was also the most important factors influencing monthly sediment load fig s1 of the supplementary information generally a porous rock matrix fractures fissures and a network of solution caves and conduits embedded in karst aquifers created complex hydrogeological karst system wilcox et al 2008 gutiérrez et al 2014 the surface and subsurface flow systems were very well connected through fissures conduits and sinkholes in karst watersheds jiang et al 2014 hartmann et al 2015 as a result the runoff coefficient in karst watershed was much lower than that in a non karst watershed wang et al 2019b large runoff was principally produced by rainfall storms with a rainfall depth 40 mm and a maximum 30 min rainfall intensity 30 mm h 1 in karst watershed peng and wang 2012 on the one hand large quantity of fractures fissures and cracks can serve as reservoirs to reserve plenty of water and hence can reduce surface runoff and the eroded soil hartmann et al 2012 jiang et al 2014 on the other hand the runoff can transport the eroded sediment through the sinkholes to the underground rivers however the conduits or sinkholes at the karst depressions were often filled with deposited sediment as a consequence a great quantity of sediment was probably deposited before it can be transported to the surface water jiang et al 2014 therefore the runoff have great effect on sediment load in karst watersheds the direct multiple stepwise linear regression mlr model fitted with the original data was compared with the mlr model after the memd fig 8 the r 2 and the nash efficiency coefficient nse of the prediction model after memd were higher than the direct fitting of the original data and the root mean square error rmse was smaller than the direct fitting of the original data as expected the monthly sediment load prediction using memd outperformed the monthly sediment load estimations based on the original data for xijiang hongshui liujiang nanpan xunjiang and yujiang karst watersheds fig s2 of the supplementary information previous studies have also shown that the prediction accuracy of the data after the memd is higher than predictions made using the original data for soil moisture soil organic carbon and saturated hydraulic conductivity hu and si 2013 she et al 2016 she et al 2017 yang et al 2019 therefore memd is a useful tool to accurately identify scale specific factors influencing monthly sediment loads and is recommended for application for nonlinear and non stationary hydrological processes however this study has some limitation the memd results cannot quantitatively reflect the effect of dam construction on monthly sediment load in karst watershed further studies are required to quantify the influence of dam construction on monthly sediment load 4 conclusions in the current study the m k analysis was used to detect the temporal variation in monthly sediment loads and the memd method was applied to decompose the monthly sediment loads and five potential influencing factors runoff precipitation temperature pe and evi at different time scales in the wujiang watershed the m k trend analysis indicated that the sediment loads from january to december all showed downward trends but this trend was only significant from march to may and from october to december may to july can dominate the annual sediment loads in the wujiang watershed and runoff and precipitation make large contributions during this time all the five factors were significantly correlated with monthly sediment loads at the observation scale p 0 01 however after the memd analysis seven intrinsic mode functions and residuals were obtained the monthly sediment loads were not significantly correlated with temperature and pe on some scales and the variance contribution rates of monthly sediment loads in the wujiang watershed were mainly on 3 2 5 5 and 12 1 month time scales this result implied that there was a scale specific relationship between monthly sediment loads and the potential influencing factors runoff and precipitation were the main factors affecting the temporal variation of monthly sediment loads in the wujiang watershed and air temperature influenced the variation of monthly sediment load on a long time scale compared with the original data the monthly sediment loads were more accurately estimated using the memd method this research shows that the memd method can link the monthly sediment loads and the scale specific controlling factors on multiple observation dates in karst watersheds credit authorship contribution statement kunheng zhu data curation formal analysis

3539,at different time scales the potential factors influencing changes in sediment transport vary because the processes of each impact factor overlaps on different time scales it is challenging to evaluate the complex multi scale relationships between monthly sediment load and its potential impact factors the objective of this study was to investigate the scale specific main factors influencing monthly sediment loads using the multivariate empirical mode decomposition memd method monthly sediment loads and five potential influencing factors runoff precipitation air temperature potential evapotranspiration and enhanced vegetation index during 2003 2017 were collected in the wujiang karst watershed of southwest china the memd method was used to decompose the temporal series of monthly sediment load into seven intrinsic mode functions imf and residuals using a hilbert transform the sum of variance contribution rates of imf1 3 2 months imf2 5 5 months and imf3 12 1 months was more than 90 although temperature and potential evapotranspiration significantly affect monthly sediment loads at the observation scale no significant relationships were observed between them at some specific scales after memd the accuracy of the prediction model after memd was better than that of the prediction model using original data runoff and precipitation were important predictors in the prediction model this study shows the advantages of the memd method for analyzing non stationary and nonlinear hydrological processes and this useful tool is recommended for application in other karst watersheds keywords soil erosion multivariate empirical mode decomposition multiscale analysis ecohydrology karst landform 1 introduction soil erosion is a major threat to soil degradation worldwide syvitski et al 2005 borrelli et al 2017 specifically soil erosion affects soil nutrients and soil carbon cycling resulting in the loss of soil nitrogen phosphorus and organic carbon which has a negative impact on agricultural production and the environment borrelli et al 2020 wuepper et al 2020 in addition soil erosion leads to environmental deterioration land productivity declines resulting in frequent floods sandstorms and other problems borrelli et al 2020 globally 75 billion tons of arable land are reported to be eroding every year equivalent to 400 billion in annual losses borrelli et al 2017 soil erosion is becoming more and more serious and has become a worrying global environmental problem wang et al 2016 soil erosion and re deposition of sediments have reshaped the earth s surface and affected the functioning of ecosystems and social structures wuepper et al 2020 sediment transport caused by soil erosion is one of the main components of global environmental change wang et al 2016 therefore it is of paramount importance to understand the factors influencing sediment transport to develop effective watershed management and sustainable agricultural production sediment erosion generally includes a variety of processes including raindrop splashing soil particle separation runoff erosion and transportation therefore variations in river sediment transport are affected by a variety of driving factors including runoff precipitation air temperature potential evapotranspiration and vegetation coverage li et al 2020a casserly et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 runoff plays a key role in the dynamics of sediment transport in ecosystem basins and it is also a controlling factor affecting the contribution of maximum sediment transport fortesa et al 2020 precipitation is one of the main factors affecting soil erosion at watershed scale especially for the extreme precipitation events which can generate a huge soil loss wan et al 2014 li et al 2020a tian et al 2017 wei et al 2021 air temperature has a great influence on runoff thereby impacting sediment transport tian et al 2019 change in potential evapotranspiration is closely related to the vegetation coverage and air temperature which alters the sediment load tuset et al 2016 li et al 2020a precipitation is the main kinetic energy causing soil erosion and runoff and on the contrary vegetation can reduce the generation of such kinetic energy vegetation can reduce raindrop energy delay runoff generation time root systems can consolidate soil and the humus produced can improve soil texture thus enhancing resistance to soil erosion wei et al 2007 duan et al 2016 wang and sun 2020 in general the relationship between sediment load and its potential influencing factors varies greatly on different time scales e g annual flood season monthly and daily scales gao et al 2016 one factor may have a strong influence at a particular scale but the same factor may exhibit a minor influence on another scale therefore it is necessary to evaluate the relationships between sediment load and various influencing factors at a specific scales many methods have been used to investigate the multi scale relationships between sediment loads and its potential influencing factors include wavelet analysis gao et al 2014 liu et al 2017 li et al 2018 and linear spectral analysis restrepo and kjerfve 2000 venditti and bennett 2000 rossi et al 2009 gebreslassie et al 2020 however these methods are based on the superposition principle and assume sediment production is a linear process hydrological changes are influenced by many factors the influence expressed by different frequency components in the process is not additive so it does not follow the superposition principle she et al 2013 although wavelet analysis can identify the characteristics of signals in the time and frequency domains zhu et al 2018 the number of wavelet bases and decomposition layers needs to be set artificially and lacks self adaptability bai et al 2015 alternatively multiple empirical mode decomposition memd is an extension of empirical mode decomposition emd and has the characteristics of complete adaptability memd can also divide sediment loads and potential influencing factors into different intrinsic mode functions imfs and residues at the same scale effectively solving the problems of stationarity and linear assumptions therefore memd is well suited to handle nonlinear and non stationary hydrological processes hu and si 2013 li et al 2020a many previous studies have applied memd in soil properties hu and si 2013 she et al 2016 ma et al 2017 she et al 2017 yang et al 2019 and there have been a few studies on annual sediment load li et al 2020a generally runoff precipitation temperature potential evapotranspiration and vegetation coverage all exhibit significant seasonal or monthly variation which may lead to seasonal variations in sediment load nevertheless most of the previous studies are concerned with annual data series which may mask seasonal variations of sediment load furthermore the distinct hydrogeology heterogeneous landscapes rugged geomorphology rich biodiversity and fragile ecosystems may enhance the temporal variability of monthly sediment loads in karst landscapes few studies however have attempted to quantify the multiscale relationships between monthly sediment loads and their potential influencing factors especially in karst watersheds where an ecologically vulnerable area experiencing severe soil erosion karst landscapes account for 7 to 12 of global land area and provide water for nearly a quarter of the global population gutiérrez et al 2014 hartmann et al 2015 southwest china has one of the largest humid karst landforms from tropical or subtropical regions in the world qin et al 2020 tong et al 2020 in karst region of southwest china soil erosion directly affects 1 7 million people hinders local economic development and is the main ecological disaster jiang et al 2014 karst areas are characterized by low rates of soil formation and high permeability and are one of the most ecologically fragile geomorphological areas jiang et al 2014 wang et al 2019b increasing population and inappropriate land uses have accelerated ecological environment problems such as rocky desertification and soil erosion in karst areas yan and cai 2015 li et al 2017 furthermore due to the subtropical humid monsoon climate in southwest china heavy precipitation may also lead to a large amount of soil erosion li et al 2016 wang et al 2019a additionally the special hydrogeology heterogeneous landscapes and rugged geomorphology made the soil erosion more complicated in karst areas than non karst areas jiang et al 2014 li et al 2020c however the time scale relationships between monthly sediment load and runoff vegetation and other influencing factors were still unclear consequently this study provides an opportunity to test the applicability of the memd method for exploring the scale specific factors influencing monthly sediment load in karst watersheds the objectives of this study were 1 to identify the temporal variation in monthly sediment loads and related factors during 2003 to 2017 in a typical karst area of wujiang watershed 2 to investigate the multiscale relationships between monthly sediment loads and their potential controlling factors using the memd method and 3 to further estimate the monthly sediment loads at the observation scale based on the scale specific control factors 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area as the largest river in guizhou province the wujiang river originates at xianglushan huayu cave in weining county in the western part of guizhou province flows through northern guizhou and southeastern chongqing and ultimately joins the yangtze river in fuling district of chongqing the wujiang river is an important tributary of the upper reaches of the yangtze river and a major water supply river for the three gorges project the main stream of the wujiang river has a total length of 1 037 km and a basin area of 87 900 square kilometers it has two sources the southern source is the three chahe river which originates in weining county in western guizhou and the northern source is the six chong river and originates in the yunnan guizhou junction hezhang county the north and south sources converged in the huawu base and represent the upper reaches of the wujiang river the part of the river that runs from huawu to sinan is the middle reach the wujiang river while below the sinan is the lower reach the wujiang river watershed 22 07 30 22 n 104 18 109 22 e is located in the transition slope zone from the yunnan guizhou plateau to the hills of western hunan with high terrain in the southwest and low terrain in the northeast fig 1 six other karst watersheds xijiang hongshui liujiang nanpan xunjiang and yujiang were also selected in our previous study li et al 2016 to better elaborate the temporal variation in monthly sediment load only wujiang watershed was selected in current study the land use landform climate runoff and sediment load of wujiang watershed is typical among these seven watersheds in wujiang watershed land use types are mainly cultivated land woodland and grassland with little developed area the karst landform is relatively developed and there are large differences in elevation over the terrain which creates distinct vertical changes throughout the area the wujiang river watershed basically has a subtropical monsoon climate characterized by distinct seasonal changes with a hot summer and warm winter strong monsoons and uneven distribution of precipitation throughout the year including dry season and rainy season the flood season is from may to september which accounts for about 72 of the annual precipitation different regions in the wujiang river watershed are characterized by differences in geomorphic features vegetation types and soil characteristics which contribute to great differences in the sediment loads of different regions among them as the largest tributary of the wujiang river the liucong river watershed has low vegetation coverage high sediment concentration and high soil and water losses which all contribute high sediment loads to the wujiang river 2 2 data monthly runoff and sediment load

level and there is an increasing or decreasing trend when the z is greater than 2 576 this demonstrated the α is at the 0 01 level and there is a strong increasing or decreasing trend 2 3 2 multivariate empirical mode decomposition memd memd can decompose complex signals into finite intrinsic mode functions and residuals and then stabilize the non stationary data and obtain the frequencies with physical significance by using a hilbert transform zhu et al 2018 memd can decompose the signal according to its own time scale which has obvious advantages in processing non stationary and nonlinear data yang et al 2019 assume that the n dimensional vector data representing the sediment load and its influencing factors v s v 1 s v 2 s v 3 s is a function of the data s x θ k x 1 k x 2 k x n k is the angle vector θ k θ 1 k θ 2 k θ n 1 k k 1 2 n data with different directions and n is the number of all directions intrinsic mode functions imf of nonlinear k spatial data

iterative operation will continue through the above decomposition process the original n dimensional variable v s v 1 s v 2 s v n s is decomposed into a series of imf d s i 1 q and the sum of residue items rehman and mandic 2010 to test the applicability of the memd method in quantifying the multiscale relationships between monthly sediment loads and their controlling factors this method was also applied in other karst watersheds i e xijiang hongshui liujiang nanpan xunjiang and yujiang the detailed information of these six karst watersheds can be found in our previous study li et al 2016 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of monthly sediment load and related factors at observation scale descriptive statistical parameters of monthly sediment loads and the potential influencing factors in the wujiang watershed are shown in table 1 the highest monthly sediment loads of the wujiang watershed were 607 4 104 t and the mean value was 39 0 104 t with a 220 coefficient of variation the monthly sediment loads exhibited strong variability cv 100 nielsen and bouma 1985 for the runoff precipitation temperature potential evapotranspiration and evi the coefficient of variation values ranged from 40 to 70 indicating moderate variability 10 cv 100 nielsen and bouma 1985 generally sediment load is affected by many factors and has great variation specifically the sediment load is affected by temperature precipitation runoff geology and geomorphology and human activities and so the sediment load exhibits stronger variability than its influencing factors which is consistent with some previous studies knapen et al 2007 li et al 2016 li et al 2017 fig 2 shows the temporal variation in monthly sediment loads and the five influencing factors on the observed scale from 2003 to 2017 annual sediment loads in 2003 1432 104 t 2004 1080 104 t and 2007 1040 104 t were all greater than in other years there were large differences between monthly sediment loads fig 2 3 with the exception of may sediment load in june and july were significantly higher than those in other months p 0 05 fig 3 similarly the runoff in june and july were also significantly greater than those in other months p 0 05 fig 3 significant values for precipitation temperature potential evapotranspiration and evi were observed in june july august july august and june august respectively p 0 05 fig 3 it is important to note that the sediment load from may to july accounts for about 40 90 of the annual sediment load this indicated that the annual sediment load was dominated by a few months the sediment load of a single extreme precipitation event can exceed the average sediment load for many years estrany et al 2010 li et al 2020b may to july or even the extreme erosive events are probably the primary periods controlling sediment transport identifying the monthly or extreme erosion events will help provide important information about how to effectively facilitate soil erosion control measures table 2 shows the results of m k trend analysis of sediment transport in the wujiang watershed for 12 months during 2003 2017 sediment load in any month from january to december all showed a decreasing trend while a significant decreasing trend was only observed in march to may and october to december the decrease of sediment transport from 2003 to 2017 may be largely due to the influence of human activities such as the dam construction and soil conservation measures wu et al 2020 the grain for green project was initialized in 1999 in the wujiang watershed and the conversion of farmland to forest and grassland was fully implemented which greatly reduced soil erosion ye et al 2020 furthermore extensive construction of cascade hydropower reservoirs especially upstream of the wujiang river were also responsible for the sharp decrease in sediment loads wang et al 2019a ye et al 2020 therefore soil and water conservation measures and cascade hydropower reservoirs construction had a profound impact on river sediment transport and made important contributions to the reduction of sediment transport li et al 2020d wu et al 2020 before the memd analysis the relationships between sediment loads and the potential influencing factors were evaluated fig 4 runoff precipitation temperature potential evapotranspiration and evi all had a significant impact on monthly sediment loads p 0 05 fig 4 previous studies have indicated that no significant relationships were found between annual sediment yield and temperature in six karst watersheds in southwest china li et al 2020a this implies that the factors influencing the sediment loads are different between the monthly and annual temporal scale consequently a better understanding of the factors influencing monthly sediment load is essential to reasonably manage river flows 3 2 multiscale relationships between monthly sediment load and related factors the multiple data sets of monthly sediment load and its five influencing factors were decomposed into seven imfs and residues using the memd method fig 5 an imf with the same numerical value has different oscillation frequency and width among the sediment load and its five influencing factors similar to the emd method imfs with large numerical values correspond to a large time scale but a small oscillation frequency while imfs with small numerical values have a large oscillation frequency on a small time scale hu and si 2013 yang et al 2019 li et al 2020a for example the fluctuation amplitude of monthly sediment loads and runoff in imf1 and imf2 were large which indicates that the temporal variability of sediment load and runoff was large the residue sequence shows the transformation trend of the original data she et al 2016 ma et al 2017 the temporal patterns of residue sequence for sediment loads is similar to evi showing a decreasing trend while the other four factors showed an increasing trend table 3 shows the imf values for sediment load and its five influencing factors obtained by a hilbert conversion the scales of monthly sediment load and its potential influencing factors corresponding to a specific imf were averaged to indicate the scale of that imf for all the variables the mean values of the specific scales of imf1 imf2 imf3 imf4 imf5 imf6 and imf7 were 3 5 5 5 12 1 17 3 25 7 58 1 and 76 3 months respectively the specific scale of almost all variables increased with the increase in the imf value except for temperature the scale of temperature at imf6 is 70 months which is twice the size of temperature at imf7 similar results were also reported by yang et al 2019 and li et al 2020a with the increase of the imf value the difference of the specific scale among the seven imfs also gradually expands especially in the largest scale this is because only a finite period of oscillation is included within a limited observational scale rehman and mandic 2010 liu et al 2016 table 3 also shows that the specific scale of different factors were similar at small time scales while significant difference was observed at the long time scales this implied that there was no accurate common scale among all factors at the long time scales which is similar to the results of previous studies she et al 2017 yang et al 2019 table 4 shows the extent to which all imf contribute to the original variances the variance contribution rates of sediment loads and the five related factors are mainly distributed in imf1 imf2 and imf3 the sum of variance contribution rates of imf1 to imf3 for sediment loads and the five factors were all greater than 90 this indicates that the fluctuation of short time scales of 3 2 imf1 5 5 imf2 and 12 1 months imf3 are dominant especially for the imf3 time scale about one year the variance contribution rate of runoff precipitation air temperature potential evapotranspiration and evi were all greater than 59 while this value for monthly sediment load were only 44 the contribution rate of residue variance in the current study was relatively low compared with the values reported by she et al 2017 and li et al 2020a this difference may be attributed to the larger scale variation of the residue and a short capture scale in the current study rehman and mandic 2010 hu and si 2013 it is worth noting that the sum of variance contribution rates of all imfs and residuals is not equal to 100 table 4 this may be due to the lack of complete orthogonality among imfs and the related processes occurring at each specific scale are not independent of each other hu and si 2013 she et al 2016 she et al 2017 huang et al 2003 pointed out that this orthogonality is not necessary when memd is used to extend nonlinear and non stationary time series and this was verified using a detailed calculation process actually the linear decomposition system is required orthogonality rehman and mandic 2010 lack of orthogonality is a great advantage for the nonlinear decomposition systems such as memd hu and si 2013 yang et al 2019 li et al 2020a therefore the memd method was suitable to analyze the non stationary nonlinear data set in current study fig 6 shows the correlation between monthly sediment loads and the five related factors among all the imfs and residuals at the observation scale the five related factors are all significantly positively correlated with sediment load p 0 05 fig 4 after memd there is a significantly negative correlation or no significant correlation between sediment loads and the relevant factors at some specific scales fig 6 for example the potential evapotranspiration was significantly positive with monthly sediment load at imf3 imf4 and imf5 while significantly negative relationship was observed between precipitation and monthly sediment load at imf6 fig 6 the positive correlation at one scale could reduce or cancel negative correlation at another scale resulting low overall correlation hu et al 2014 generally air temperature and potential evapotranspiration was significantly correlated with monthly sediment load on a long time scale which is similar to the result of li et al 2020a air temperature and potential evapotranspiration indirectly affects sediment load by affecting plant growth and community composition which may explain why air temperature and potential evapotranspiration has an impact on sediment loads on a long time scale but not on a short time li et al 2017 runoff and precipitation are significantly correlated with sediment loads in all imf which is related to the direct involvement of runoff and precipitation in soil erosion and its influence on river sediment loads zhang et al 2020 precipitation and runoff play key roles in the changes of sediment loads and are generally the main factors that influence monthly sediment loads wang et al 2016 li et al 2017 fortesa et al 2020 similarly evi has a significant effect on monthly sediment load at all imfs fig 6 it is important to note that the evi is significantly positive with monthly sediment load at small time scales such as imf1 and imf2 fig 6 generally the vegetation can greatly reduce soil erosion by intercepting rainfall decreasing raindrop impact energy enhancing infiltration and improving soil structure knapen et al 2007 duan et al 2016 borrelli et al 2017 however at the month scale the great erosion events mainly happened during june to september when the vegetation had the maximum coverage as a result high evi generally corresponds to great sediment load and thus positive relationship is observed between evi and sediment load at monthly scale as expected evi is significantly negative with sediment load at large time scales such as imf4 and imf6 fig 6 therefore the overall correlation between evi and sediment load was relatively low since positive correlation at small time scale would cancel negative correlation at long time scale 3 3 monthly sediment load estimation based on its scale specific controlling factors stepwise multiple linear regression was used to predict the monthly sediment loads of all imf and residuals from the same imf scale specific control factor table 5 all the prediction models of monthly sediment loads and the related factors have large r 2 which indicates that their predictions at these scales are relatively accurate for monthly sediment load the adjusted r 2 of imf2 0 723 imf3 0 725 and imf4 0 854 were all higher than for imf1 0 576 and imf5 0 656 this result implies that not all the long time scale prediction models are better than short time scales the r 2 of imf7 and residue is close to 1 indicating that almost all the variance of sediment loads can be explained by the linear correlation between sediment loads and the relevant factors the small r 2 of imf1 may be due to the influence of other factors that were not investigated in this study similar results were also observed in xijiang hongshui liujiang nanpan xunjiang and yujiang karst watersheds table s1 of the supplementary information in table 5 runoff and evi were included in almost all equations while precipitation only appeared in imf3 and imf6 and temperature was only found in large scale imf6 imf7 and residuals this further corroborates that there is a close relationship between monthly runoff and sediment loads while the temperature greatly affects monthly sediment loads at a long time scale the relative importance of explanatory factors can be expressed by the absolute value of standardized regression coefficients which varies with time scale she et al 2013 li et al 2020a for example evi was the most important explanatory variable for the four time scales captured by imf1 imf4 imf6 and imf7 on the imf3 time scale runoff was the most important explanatory variable as can be seen from table 5 evi is the most important factor relative to other factors as long as evi was involved in the equation as an explanatory variable this implies that vegetation restoration is an important component for controlling runoff and sediment loads in the wujiang watershed fig 7 exhibits the r 2 between the predicted monthly sediment loads at all scales by each variable and the monthly sediment loads at the observed scale runoff is the main factor affecting sediment loads in the wujiang watershed and precipitation and evi had slightly less effect on sediment transport than runoff in xijiang hongshui liujiang nanpan xunjiang and yujiang karst watersheds runoff was also the most important factors influencing monthly sediment load fig s1 of the supplementary information generally a porous rock matrix fractures fissures and a network of solution caves and conduits embedded in karst aquifers created complex hydrogeological karst system wilcox et al 2008 gutiérrez et al 2014 the surface and subsurface flow systems were very well connected through fissures conduits and sinkholes in karst watersheds jiang et al 2014 hartmann et al 2015 as a result the runoff coefficient in karst watershed was much lower than that in a non karst watershed wang et al 2019b large runoff was principally produced by rainfall storms with a rainfall depth 40 mm and a maximum 30 min rainfall intensity 30 mm h 1 in karst watershed peng and wang 2012 on the one hand large quantity of fractures fissures and cracks can serve as reservoirs to reserve plenty of water and hence can reduce surface runoff and the eroded soil hartmann et al 2012 jiang et al 2014 on the other hand the runoff can transport the eroded sediment through the sinkholes to the underground rivers however the conduits or sinkholes at the karst depressions were often filled with deposited sediment as a consequence a great quantity of sediment was probably deposited before it can be transported to the surface water jiang et al 2014 therefore the runoff have great effect on sediment load in karst watersheds the direct multiple stepwise linear regression mlr model fitted with the original data was compared with the mlr model after the memd fig 8 the r 2 and the nash efficiency coefficient nse of the prediction model after memd were higher than the direct fitting of the original data and the root mean square error rmse was smaller than the direct fitting of the original data as expected the monthly sediment load prediction using memd outperformed the monthly sediment load estimations based on the original data for xijiang hongshui liujiang nanpan xunjiang and yujiang karst watersheds fig s2 of the supplementary information previous studies have also shown that the prediction accuracy of the data after the memd is higher than predictions made using the original data for soil moisture soil organic carbon and saturated hydraulic conductivity hu and si 2013 she et al 2016 she et al 2017 yang et al 2019 therefore memd is a useful tool to accurately identify scale specific factors influencing monthly sediment loads and is recommended for application for nonlinear and non stationary hydrological processes however this study has some limitation the memd results cannot quantitatively reflect the effect of dam construction on monthly sediment load in karst watershed further studies are required to quantify the influence of dam construction on monthly sediment load 4 conclusions in the current study the m k analysis was used to detect the temporal variation in monthly sediment loads and the memd method was applied to decompose the monthly sediment loads and five potential influencing factors runoff precipitation temperature pe and evi at different time scales in the wujiang watershed the m k trend analysis indicated that the sediment loads from january to december all showed downward trends but this trend was only significant from march to may and from october to december may to july can dominate the annual sediment loads in the wujiang watershed and runoff and precipitation make large contributions during this time all the five factors were significantly correlated with monthly sediment loads at the observation scale p 0 01 however after the memd analysis seven intrinsic mode functions and residuals were obtained the monthly sediment loads were not significantly correlated with temperature and pe on some scales and the variance contribution rates of monthly sediment loads in the wujiang watershed were mainly on 3 2 5 5 and 12 1 month time scales this result implied that there was a scale specific relationship between monthly sediment loads and the potential influencing factors runoff and precipitation were the main factors affecting the temporal variation of monthly sediment loads in the wujiang watershed and air temperature influenced the variation of monthly sediment load on a long time scale compared with the original data the monthly sediment loads were more accurately estimated using the memd method this research shows that the memd method can link the monthly sediment loads and the scale specific controlling factors on multiple observation dates in karst watersheds credit authorship contribution statement kunheng zhu data curation formal analysis
